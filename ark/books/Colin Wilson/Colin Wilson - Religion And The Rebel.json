It was intended to document and order asubject which, for personal reasons, I find particularly absorbing: the subjectof mental strain and near-insanity.Over many years, the obsessional figure whom I have called the Outsider becamefor me the heroic figure of our time. My vision of our civilisation was a visionof cheapness and futility, the degrading of all intellectual standards. Incontrast to this, the Outsider seemed to be the man who, for any reason at all,felt himself lonely in the crowd of the second-rate. As I conceived him, hecould be a maniac carrying a knife in a black bag, taking pride in appearingharmless and normal to other people; he could be a saint or a visionary, caringfor nothing but one moment in which he seemed to understand the world, and seeinto the heart of nature and of God.The more I considered the Outsider, the more I felt him to be a symptom of ourtime and age. Essentially, he seemed to be a rebel; and what he was in rebellionagainst was the lack of spiritual tension in a materially prosperouscivilisation. The first nine books of Saint Augustine’s Confessions are anOutsider document, and Saint Augustine lived in a disintegrating Roman society.It did not seem a bold step to conclude that the Outsider is a symptom of acivilisation’s decline; Outsiders appear like pimples on a dying civilisation.An individual tends to be what his environment makes him. If a civilisation isspiritually sick, the individual suffers from the same sickness. If he ishealthy enough to put up a fight, he becomes an Outsider.The study of the spiritually sick individual belongs to psychology, but toconsider him in relation to a sick civilisation is to enter the realm ofhistory. That is why this book must attempt to pursue two courses at once,probing deeper into the Outsider himself, while at the same time moving towardsthe historical problem of the decline of civilisations. One way leads inward,towards mysticism; the other outward, towards politics. Unfortunately, I havealmost no turn for practical politics, so the emphasis in this book is onreligion and philosophy. Where the road disappears into the thickets ofpolitical theory, I leave it, and hope that someone less averse to politics thanI am will press on where I have shirked the problem.Various critics have objected—with some justification—that the term ‘Outsider’is loose; that a word which can be applied to Boehme as well as Nijinsky, to Foxand Gurdjieff as well as Lawrence, Van Gogh and Sartre, is almost meaningless.But my use of the term ‘Outsider’ is deliberately vague. The ultimate questionthat, for me, lies behind the Outsider is: How can man extend his range ofconsciousness? I believe that human beings experience a range of mental stateswhich is as narrow as the middle three notes of a piano keyboard. I believe thatthe possible range of mental states is as wide as the whole piano keyboard, andthat man’s sole aim and business is to extend his range from the usual three orfour notes to the whole keyboard. The men I dealt with in The Outsider had onething in common: an instinctive knowledge that their range could be extended,and a nagging dissatisfaction with the range of their everyday experience.This, I must admit, is the urge that underlies all my thinking and writing. Istate it here so that there shall be no doubt in any reader’s mind about thecentral preoccupation of my book.The publication of The Outsider brought me some interesting insights. Itreceived more attention than I or my publisher had expected, and, quitesuddenly, I became involved in all kinds of activities. For many months after itwas published, I had almost no time alone, caught up as I was in a round ofinterviews by reporters, lectures, broadcasts, reading and answering letters,invitations to dinner, and so on. The result was exactly what I had been afraidof: I found myself losing the preoccupations that had led me to write TheOutsider. Strangers who claimed to be Outsiders wrote me long letters explainingtheir symptoms and asking for advice, until I began to suspect parody. In thiswhirl, I discovered that I ceased to be aware of the states of consciousnessthat lie beyond my ordinary two or three notes. In my own terminology, I hadstarted to become an Insider.I record this because it is of central importance to the theme of this book.Most men I know live like this as a matter of course: working, travelling,eating and drinking and talking. The range of everyday activity in a moderncivilisation builds a wall around the ordinary state of consciousness and makesit almost impossible to see beyond it. The conditions under which we live dothis to us. It is what happens in a civilisation that always makes a noise likea dynamo, and gives no leisure for peace and contemplation. Men begin to losethat intuition of ‘unknown modes of being,’ that sense of purpose, that makesthem more than highly efficient pigs. This is the horror the Outsider revoltsagainst.Some years ago, in Winchester Cathedral, I came across a pamphlet by Mr. T. S.Eliot; it was an address which Mr. Eliot had delivered in the Cathedral, and ithad the unpromising title: ‘On the Use of Cathedrals in England.’ For threequarters of the pamphlet, Mr. Eliot talks like a studious country parson aboutthe relation of the cathedral to the parish churches. And then, towards the end,he speaks of the position of the dean and chapter, and his pamphlet suddenlybecomes an impassioned plea for leisure in a modern civilisation. He attacks theview that the dean and chapter should be general runabouts, preaching sermonsall over the parish, and emphasises that good theological thinking requiresquiet and contemplation. He adduces his own example to strengthen his point: hehas always worked as a publisher to give himself the necessary leisure forwriting, and any permanent value which his work may possess (he modestly claims)is due to the fact that he wrote only what he wanted to write, under nocompulsion to please anyone but himself.I remember being excited by this at the time. T. E. Lawrence had made the samepoint in The Seven Pillars: ‘ ... of these two poles, leisure and subsistence,we should shun subsistence ... and cling close to leisure ... Some men theremight be, uncreative, whose leisure is barren; but the activity of these wouldhave been material only ... Mankind has been no gainer by its drudges.’For my own part, I found that I preferred working as a navvy or washing dishesto life in an office; for although I had no more than the normal reluctance toface hard work, I had a very real fear of that deadening of the nerves andsensibilities that comes of boredom and submitting to one’s own self-contempt. Iwas sticking down envelopes with a damp brush one afternoon, when a young manwho seemed to enjoy being a civil servant commented: ‘Soul-destroying, isn’tit?’ A commonplace phrase, but I had never heard it before, and I repeated itlike a revelation. Not soul-destroying, but life-destroying; the stagnatinglife-force gives off smells like standing water, and the whole being ispoisoned. Desmond—that was his name—always looked well groomed and efficient,and I never saw him lose his temper. My own predisposition to boredom andirritable wretchedness inclined me to divide the world into two classes: peoplewho disliked themselves, and people who didn’t. And the former disliked thelatter even more than they disliked themselves.Such experiences were the groundwork of all my analyses, my starting point; andall my thought aimed at discovering some solution that would enable the peoplewho disliked themselves to find reasons—or methods—of overcoming self-contempt,without numbing themselves into complacency. I called the people who dislikedthemselves Outsiders. Boredom, I knew, meant not having enough to do with one’slife energies. The answer to it, quite simply, lies in extending the range ofthe consciousness: setting emotions circulating, and setting the intellectworking, until new areas of consciousness are brought to life in the way thatthe blood starts flowing again through a leg which has gone numb.That was just the starting point. It is not enough to have leisure; leisure isonly a negative concept, the wide, clear space where one can build decent housesafter knocking down slums. The next problem is to begin to build. I found ittiresome to work for an employer in a factory or laundry, and envied those menwho can make a living by doing the things they enjoy. But closer acquaintancewith such men—writers, artists, journalists—has usually proved to me that theyhave knocked down one slum only to build another—slightly more to their owntaste, but still a slum. From the point of view of spiritual health, I do notthink there is much to choose between the workman who has worked in the samefactory for forty years and is spiritually warped and stunted in consequence,and the novelist who writes the same kind of novels for forty years and has ahouse on the Riviera.It is unnatural to work for forty years in the same factory, but no moreunnatural than it is to be born. Nature is dead; every act of will is unnatural,against nature. The more one has to fight against, the more alive one can be.That was why, for me, the problem of living resolved itself into the question ofchoosing obstacles to stimulate my will. Instantly, I came to recognise that ourcivilisation is flowing in the opposite direction; all our culture and scienceis directed towards enabling us to exercise as little will as possible.Everything is made easy; and if, after a week of office routine and travellingon buses, we still feel the need to work off excess energy, we can always enjoyourselves playing all those games involving artificial obstacles, where the willis applied to beating another team of cricketers or footballers, or simply towrestling with the imaginary Sphinx who sets the newspaper crossword puzzles. Wehave also invented a form of thought that fits in with this abdication of thewill. We call it abstract philosophy. It is essentially the product of Westerncivilisation.There was an element of disguised autobiography in The Outsider; obviously,since I spent most of the book calling on other men to bear witness to my ownbeliefs. Underlying the whole argument there was the belief that real philosophyshould be the result of applying the analytical faculty—the mathematicalfaculty—to the stuff of one’s own experience. Too much experience flows over uslike water through a channel: it means nothing to us; we are unchanged by it,unconscious of it. For years before I wrote The Outsider I had kept a journal inwhich I had been mainly concerned with applying mathematical analysis to my ownexperience, and making a note when I read something that showed the samepreoccupation. There was a slow, deliberate accumulation of material that I wasable to transfer almost unchanged into the book. That material waschosen—naturally—to exclude myself.But it is time now, before launching into further analysis of other writers, toexplain my own relation to my data. What I wish to give is as full an account aspossible of how the problems of the Outsider came to preoccupy me. Some of thedifficult issues to be found in the next three hundred pages of the presentvolume could easily become totally obscured without such a preface. Besides, myexistentialist premises demand it. Philosophy is nothing if it is not an attemptto take one’s own experience apart under a microscope.When I was eleven years old, my grandfather gave me a tattered and coverlessscience-fiction magazine. (This was in the second year of the war, and I hadnever seen such a thing before.) It was here that I discovered a name of which Ihad never heard: Albert Einstein. It was difficult to determine, from thereferences in the stories, precisely what Professor Einstein had done, but everywriter in the magazine mentioned him at least once, and the Letters to theEditor were sprinkled with his name.The stories themselves excited me more than anything I had ever read. They weremostly about Experiments that got Out of Hand. There was one about a scientistwho made a speck of grey protoplasmic matter, which was somehow thrown into thesea and grew larger as it ate up the fishes, until finally it developed a habitof engulfing passenger liners or depopulating small islands. There was anotherabout a scientist who made an Atomic Fire that was inextinguishable, and went onburning until it threatened to burn up the whole world.I had never read anything like it. Compared to boys’ papers and comics, it waserudite and intellectual. And one had a feeling of far more serious issues atstake than in stories about football games and ragging in the Lower Fourth.(‘Yarroo, you rotter! I’ll tell old Quelchy!’) There was talk about positronsand cyclotrons and the theory of probability. Not to mention Professor Einstein.I found Einstein’s own little volume, Relativity, the Special and GeneralTheory, and conscientiously plugged away at it, skipping the mathematics andwondering what the devil he meant by ‘orientation.’ But Sir James Jeans waseasier; his explanation of the Michel-son-Morley experiment simplifiedeverything. From then on I thought I understood relativity. I enjoyed a certainamount of consideration among the boys at school as a consequence of tangling upthe physics master on obscure questions about the speed of light in a movingco-ordinate system. They nicknamed me ‘Professor,’ and relied on me to waste asmuch of our physics lectures as possible by objecting that Newton was out ofdate and discredited. But secretly I admired Newton, for I imagined him asoccupying a place in the hierarchy—Archimedes, Galileo, Newton, Planck,Einstein—which would one day include myself.But my curiosity was not confined to purely scientific questions. Sir JamesJeans begins The Mysterious Universe with a passage that might have been asermon on Pascal’s text: ‘The eternal silence of these infinite spaces terrifiesme.’ This, and other passages of speculation, produced a sense of mystery thatwas so intolerable to me that I once wrote a twenty-page letter to Sir ArthurEddington, asking him if he could please explain to me what the universe was allabout. When I asked the local librarian where I could find his address, she toldme that he had died earlier in the year. I was not wholly disappointed, since Ihad come to the conclusion that he was unlikely to know the answer anyway. Thiswas in 1944.I see now that it was Jeans and Eddington who were responsible for my suddenmental awakening at the age of twelve; at the time, I thought of Einstein as‘the master.’ I believed that Einstein had taught me the impossibility of makinga final judgement on anything. I tried to explain to school friends that spacewas infinite and yet bounded; and it seemed to me that the possibilities ofhuman life were also infinite and yet bounded: that within its framework ofendless repetition, anything could be done. It was to be another five yearsbefore I read Zarathustra and discovered that Nietzsche also recognised EternalRecurrence as the foundation of an essentially optimistic philosophy.But this notion was of secondary importance compared to that of the Will toPower. This is so central to my way of thinking that I should perhaps explain atsome length how my ideas on the subject originated.In some popular textbook of psychology, I had read summaries of the systems ofFreud, Jung and Adler. Freud’s insistence on childhood influences and the sexualurges seemed even then to be nonsense; Jung’s theory of types struck me asequally irrelevant. But Adler’s idea of the Power Instinct came to me as arevelation; it seemed to tie together all my observations of human beings, toadd the final touch to the edifice that Einstein had begun. A great deal of achild’s time is spent in being treated unfairly and wondering about the rightsand wrongs of the case; also in observing that, although all adults seem to himto be equally self-possessed and balanced in judgement, yet there are some whoare badly spoken of by others, or labeled as shifty, dishonest or stupid byone’s parents. It is all very confusing. It leads the child to realise that hecannot leave the business of making judgements entirely to the adult world. Andwhen such a child tries to form his own judgements, the real confusion begins.In most issues between adults, there seems very little to choose. It is less amatter of rights and wrongs than of individuals with their own will toself-assertion. So my summary of the situation went like this: ‘right’ and‘wrong’ are relative terms; they have no final meaning; the reality behind humanconflicts is only a will to self-assertion. Nobody is right; nobody is wrong;but everyone wants to be thought right.Adler’s use of the term ‘inferiority complex’ supplied me with my fundamentalidea. I decided that the desire of every human being is to appear in as good alight as possible to himself. And since the opinions of other people affect theway we see ourselves, we seek to preserve our complacency by winning theirrespect or friendship. Of course, there is another way: to cut oneself offcompletely from the opinion of other people and build a wall around one’s ownself-esteem. The lunatic who believes he is Napoleon or Christ has done this—soI felt. The difference between the lunatic and the sane person is only that thesane person prefers to get other people to co-operate in maintaining hisdelusions.There came a day when I took up a pen and settled down to writing a long essayabout these ideas. I began it in a new school notebook that had written insidethe cover ‘Colin Wilson, Form 2C,’ and underneath it, in block capitals printedin red ink: ‘These notes are based on the relativity theory of Albert Einstein,and the system of Individual Psychology of Alfred Adler.’The writing of that essay was an unforgettable experience. Years later, when Iread in The Varieties of Religious Experience of Jouffroy’s feelings of terrorwhile analysing his own unbelief,* I remembered that night in 1944 when I wrotemy ‘Essay on Superiority’ at a single sitting. It seemed that I had penetrateddeeper into unbelief than any other human being; that by questioning too deeply,I had cut myself off from the rest of the human race. My brother came to bed inthe same room while I wrote. Towards three o’clock in the morning, I turned offthe light and climbed into bed beside him, feeling at the same time an awfulfear that God would strike me dead in the night. I felt that I had destroyed inmyself a certain necessary basis of illusion that makes life bearable for humanbeings. I had done this in the name of ‘truth’; and now I felt no elation, onlya sort of fatigue of the brain that would not let me sleep. Truth, it seemed,had no power of intensifying life; only of destroying the illusions that makelife tolerable.I still remember my surprise when I woke up in the morning and found I was stillalive. God either didn’t care, or didn’t exist.This was the beginning of a long period in which the key word, for me, was‘futility.’ During this period, I felt that ‘futility’ was the final comment onhuman life. It was the worst and most depressing period of my life. It was not acase of my ideas depressing me; there was a social maladjustment for which theideas provided the excuse. At thirteen I should have had friends—especially girlfriends. Instead, I spent three years in my bedroom, reading and writing. Thesexual desires I knew at the time were mere physical urges; there was no need ordesire for friendly human intercourse. My admiration went to a certain ideal ofcold brutality of intellect; while I wondered with despair where the motivationfor such an attitude could lie, if not in the realms of delusion andself-assertion that I despised. When I read some sage or philosopher proclaimingthat human beings are hopelessly deluded, I wondered what reason he had forsaying so, other than a deluded wish to be admired for his cynicism. Human lifeseemed a vicious circle; the desire for life a delusion. I asked myself: Whomade the delusion? and decided that, whatever inscrutable aim inspired the GreatDelusion-Maker, it presupposed human futility and vanity. I was not ever certainthat the Great Delusion-Maker himself might not be inspired by delusions.Added to this was the exhaustion of reading and thinking too much; also, ofcourse, the sexual unfulfilment. Shaw comments in one of the later prefaces thatmost young men need sex several years before it is socially convenient for themto have it. This, I think, is especially true nowadays, and the consequence is aresidue of sexual hunger that may take years of libertinism to assuage. At allevents, I believe that sex played as important a part as my eschatologicaldoubts in making me wretched in my early teens.I wrote as an antidote to misery or boredom. I became ashamed of the‘Superiority’ essay, and wrote further essays in which I sought a more technicalterminology. The central theme was always the same: that men are machines drivenby emotions, that the ‘desire for truth’ is always some less creditable urgedisguised by the emotions; that ‘truth’ would be as useless to human beings asbookcases are to cows. I find the two little notebooks of ‘Subjective Essays’filled with speculations on the nature of human impulses, and can see now thatthese speculations were an attempt to track down the element of free will inman. In the essay on Fanaticism, I state that the fanatic is the luckiest of allliving beings, for he is driven by the most intense delusions. Somewhere—inWells’s Outline of History, I think—I have seen those huge Egyptian statues ofAmenhotep III that are called the Colossi of Memnon; and in them I saw my symbolof the real philosopher, the man who could say that his reason was notprejudiced by emotion; huge, eyeless, immobile. Only in the dead, I felt, wasthere no emotional prejudice; consequently, only the dead may be called sane.And somewhere in the essays, I acknowledge that free will may exist, but in sucha small degree as to be hardly knowable. I found myself confronted by an urge toanalyse my way to truth that concluded in a recognition that truth is of no usefor survival.I had other pursuits that kept me from complete abdication of will. From the ageof eleven, physics and chemistry had been my major interests, and by the age oftwelve I had made the spare room into a laboratory in which I spent most of myweekends and evenings; the pocket money I earned from a paper round was spent onchemicals. Then, in the August holiday of 1944, I conceived the idea of writinga book which would summarise, in formula and laws, all my knowledge of chemistryand physics. The scheme fascinated me so much that I soon made it moreambitious, and decided to write chapters on Astronomy, Geology, Psychology,Aeronautics, Philosophy and Mathematics. I had bought, at some church bazaar,six volumes of a self-educator with ‘courses’ on all these subjects. With thehelp of this and books from the local library, I began my attempt to summariseall the scientific knowledge of humanity. I wrote it in notebooks that heldabout fifteen thousand words each, and had filled six of these before it wastime to go back to school. It was my first book, and I worked on it continuouslyand systematically—the best possible training for a writer.In those years of the ‘Subjective Essays,’ the greatest impact on my mind wasBernard Shaw. I had seen Gabriel Pascal’s film of Caesar and Cleopatra withoutbeing particularly impressed; it reminded me too much of Shakespeare, whom I hadalways found unreadable. But during the first week of the B.B.C.’s ThirdProgramme, I switched on the radio one evening to hear Mr. Esme Percy’s voicedeclaiming:> Friends and fellow brigands. I have a proposal to make to this meeting. We> have now spent three evenings in discussing the question Have Anarchists or> Social-Democrats the most personal courage? We have gone into the principles> of Anarchism and Social-Democracy at great length. The cause of Anarchy has> been ably represented by our one Anarchist, who doesn’t know what Anarchism> means ... 1*It was the beginning of the third act of Man and Superman. Even now, after morethan ten years, I find it impossible to read this act without a curious feelingof awe. It was a totally new experience. I will not pretend that I wasenthralled. I was not; I was partly bored, and could not follow a lot of it. ButI was astounded that another man had actually thought and written about theproblems that preoccupied me. Up till then, I had had a little private game withmyself in which I examined everyone I met and tried to decide how close theywere to seeing the world as I saw it; there was always an element ofself-congratulation in the fact that I felt certain no one ever had. I wasalready beginning to enjoy that first terror of feeling myself completely alone.It had become a commonplace of my thinking that no man asked himself what lifewas about; or if he did, answered with arrant nonsense or wishful thinking. (Ionce asked my grandfather—during an argument about the existence of God—if heunderstood the purpose of life, and he told me solemnly that he did, and that hewould explain it to me when I was fourteen. Nothing I could say would draw himout. Unfortunately, he died when I was eleven.) Now I heard Shaw speaking quiteplainly about the purpose of life, and answering that it was a will toself-understanding. It sounded plausible. It seemed paradoxical enough. And thedevil expressed my central obsession with the idea of futility and purposelessrepetition:> ... Where you now see reform, progress, fulfilment of upward tendency,> continual ascent by Man on the stepping stones of his dead selves to higher> things, you will see nothing but an infinite comedy of illusion. You will> discover the profound truth of the saying of my friend Koheleth, that there is> nothing new under the sun. Vanitas vanitatum ...And Don Juan interrupts impatiently:> ... Clever dolt that you are, is a man no better than a worm, or a dog than a> wolf, because he gets tired of everything? Shall he give up eating because he> destroys his appetite in the act of gratifying it? 2I went to bed that night with a sort of mental numbness. I felt that somethingof tremendous importance had happened to me, something which I could not yetfully grasp. During the night, I woke up and put out my hand to my brother; thebedclothes had slipped off him and he was as cold as tin. For a moment Ibelieved him dead, and it seemed the natural and inevitable result of knowingtoo much and prying too deep. It was an immense relief when I covered him up andhe grew warm again; and as much a surprise, in its way, as the morning I woke upand found I was still alive.I listened to the repeat of the play the following evening, all six hours of it,and borrowed it from the local library and read it through the day after that. Ithink that no other forty-eight hours of my life has given me such a sense of amental earthquake. Subsequently I read through all the plays (although not, atthat time, the prefaces). The English master at school told me that anadmiration for Shaw was something that often ‘happens’ in the teens, anddisappears after five years or so. I find that, after twelve years, Shaw stillseems to me the greatest figure in European literature since Dante.Shaw was less of a mental tonic than might be expected. At that time, a sense ofexhaustion and greyness seemed to wash around on the edge of my mind. I made ahabit of wandering into churches and engaging the priest in arguments about theexistence of God and the purpose of life. Sometimes, if the argument went on toolong, I left the church feeling a little dizzy, and with an underlying certaintythat stupidity and futility were the inescapable warp and weft of living. Theseperiods of depression sometimes lasted for days. (One such priest, I remember,advised me to read nothing but newspapers for a year, telling me that I wassuffering from mental indigestion from reading too much. I was delighted laterwhen, in Fox’s Journal, I read about the priest of Mancetter who advised him totake tobacco and sing psalms.*) I had passed beyond my period of militantatheism. The idea that there was no God no longer gave me a feeling of freedom.In my childhood I had been greatly given to praying mentally while I walkedaround; I was an incorrigible talker, and enjoyed keeping up a one-sidedconversation when there was no one else to talk to, frequently apologising toGod when my attention was distracted and I lost the thread of the discussion.Now I would have been glad to pray—except for the gloomy certainty that it wouldbe mere emotional dishonesty. I had begun to read T. S. Eliot’s poetry at thistime, stimulated by some remark of the French master about his obscurity. In thefirst few lines I read, I found the words:> And I pray that I may forget> > These matters that with myself I too much discuss> > Too much explainand> Teach us to care and not to care> > Teach us to sit still.3Immediately I felt I knew what he was talking about. After that, I tended torepeat Ash Wednesday as a form of mental prayer. It furnished a sort of antidoteto depression and exhaustion that Shaw could not provide.When I was sixteen, I left school, having passed my School Certificate. I hadwanted to take some job where I could study for a B.Sc. (My chief ambition wasstill to be a scientist.) Unfortunately I needed five credits to be exempt frommatriculation; I only had four, and had to take the maths exam again. In themeantime, I took a job in a warehouse; it involved weighing crates of wool whenthey came into the warehouse, keeping a number of girls and machines suppliedwith hanks of wool, and ‘weighing out’ the wool when it had been wound on tospools. I was not particularly miserable, but the hours were longer than any Ihad known before—from eight till six, with a break for lunch—and the work washeavier. After a while, the job began to bore me, and I tried various remediesto counteract my growing detestation for it. I read a great deal of poetry,because I found it relaxed me and refreshed me; I planned short stories and along play while I worked, and wrote them in the evenings. After two months, Ipassed my maths exam with the necessary credit, and left the warehouse withoutregrets. I hated hard work.In comparison, my job as a laboratory assistant at my old school seemed like aholiday. But I now found that I had lost all interest in science. I had writtenthree acts of an immensely long play, designed as a sequel to Shaw’s Man andSuperman, and was convinced that I could make a living as a writer. I had myfirst short story published at about this time—it was in a factory magazineprinted in Yorkshire. An uncle who worked in Durham had submitted the story forme, and the editor had written saying he thought I had talent, and would be gladto receive further contributions. The magazine collapsed about a month later,but by then I had conceived and begun to write another half-dozen short storiesand some one-act plays. I wrote a long dialogue, set in the Temple at Jerusalem,between Jesus (aged sixteen) and a member of the Sanhedrin, putting my ownarguments into Jesus’s mouth, and the views of the priests with whom I hadtalked into the old man’s. (I left this lengthy play on a bus shortly after Ihad finished it and never recovered it.)I was causing an increasing dissatisfaction among the science masters at school.I spent most of my ‘study time’ in the library, writing plays and short stories,and most of my physics and maths lectures reading The Pickwick Papers under thedesk. It is a sign of the patience and amiability of the headmaster that no onecalled me to account until the yearly exams made it impossible to ignore mycomplete loss of interest in science. Even then, I was exhorted to mend my ways,and told that I could stay on conditionally. I explained that I wanted to be awriter. They sympathetically paid me two months’ wages and sacked me.It would be untrue if I gave the impression that my term as a laboratoryassistant was a period of peace and relaxation. I found too much leisure more ofa nuisance than too little, and suffered agonies of boredom. I had a standingfeud with one of the masters, who was adept at inflicting petty indignities andirritated me intensely. I frequently took days off, alleging illness, and spentthem cycling out to Warwick or Matlock or Nottingham to work off my surplusenergies. The periods of depression came more frequently and lasted longer. Ihad begun to keep a journal, inspired by some B.B.C. programme about MarieBashkirtseff. Now I filled page after page every evening with expressions of myboredom and frustration, analyses of the books I had read (I had begun to readIbsen, Pirandello and Joyce; I hated Ulysses) and diatribes against the people Idisliked. Once, when an English master had been scathing about an essay I hadwritten denouncing the concept of Shakespearian tragedy, I covered twenty pagesof the journal before my indignation had subsided enough to allow me to sleep. Iwrote the journal with the idea of ultimate publication, as I had no doubt thatevery word I had ever written would one day be of interest to students. I filledten large-sized notebooks in just over a year, and then one day destroyed themall in a fit of disgust. I also had innumerable short stories and plays rejectedby publishers, and finally stopped sending them out, finding that the remotepossibility that they might be accepted scarcely justified the depression whichI underwent each time they were returned. The underlying feeling of futility wasstill my major problem. My one-act plays were comedies, and most of the shortstories owed their style to The Pickwick Papers, and I disliked myself forwriting such stuff. Occasional attempts to write like Poe made me feel worse. Iwrote with a sense of obsession, hating the medium. I also knew most of T. S.Eliot’s poetry by heart now, but it had no notable influence on my style.The worst insight came during the long Easter holiday of 1948. I had beenreading far too much—out of boredom—and spent a whole day reading Janko Lavrin’slittle book on Russian literature. It is not very cheerful reading, with itsdescriptions of the stories of Chekhov, Saltykov’s Golovlyov Family, Goncharov’sOblomov. I went into the kitchen to switch on the stove to make tea, and had ablackout. It was a strange sensation. I stood there, fully conscious, clutchingthe stove to keep upright, and yet conscious of nothing but blackness. There wasan electric sensation in my brain, so that I could readily have believed that Ihad been given an electric shock. It was as if something were flowing throughme, and I had an insight of what lay on the other side of consciousness. Itlooked like an eternity of pain. When my vision cleared, I switched on thekettle and went into the other room. I could not be certain what I had seen, butI was afraid of it. It seemed as if I were the bed of a river, and the currentwas all pain. I thought I had seen the final truth that life does not lead toanything; it is an escape from something, and the ‘something’ is a horror thatlies on the other side of consciousness. I could understand what Kurtz had seenin Heart of Darkness. All the metaphysical doubts of years seemed to gather to apoint, in one realisation: What use is such truth? Later in the day, I went outcycling; there seemed to be a supreme irony in every manifestation of life thatI saw. Eliot’s lines from The Waste Land ran in my head:> On Margate sands.> > I can connect> > Nothing with nothing.> > The broken fingernails of dirty hands ... 4Later, I wrote about it in my journal, with a sense that the futility had nowcome its full circle; for until then, writing in my journal had been the oneaction that did not seem futile; now I was recording my certainty of thefutility of everything. And yet I recorded it with a compulsive sense thateverything should be told.I think I recognised how far the source of these periods of exhaustion wasphysical. It seemed a further reason for nihilistic unbelief. All thingsdepended upon mere physical energy. Therefore, there was no will.I had seen the word ‘nihilism’ somewhere, and asked the English master at schoolwhat it meant. ‘Belief in nothing,’ he told me, and at once I thought I hadfound a name for my own state of mind. It was not just lack of belief inanything—it was active belief in Nothing. I cannot now understand thesignificance that that word ‘Nothing’ carried for me then. I remember, though,how I discovered the Tao Te Ching in a compilation called The Bible of theWorld, and read:> There is a thing inherent and natural,> > Which existed before heaven and earth.> > Motionless and fathomless,> > It stands alone and never changes;> > It pervades everywhere and never becomes exhausted.> > It may be regarded as the Mother of the Universe> > I do not know its name.> > If I am forced to give it a name,> > I call it Tao, and I name it Supreme.> > Supreme means going on;> > Going on means going far;> > Going far means returning.> > > > > Therefore Tao is supreme; heaven is supreme; earth is supreme; and man is also> supreme. There are in the universe four things supreme, and man is one of> them.5I was certain that ‘Tao’ was my positive principle of Nothingness. The line‘Going far means returning’ I took to mean a recognition that all thought chasesits own tail: vanitas vanitatum. As to the last section, with its ‘Man issupreme,’ my already Swiftian views on the stupidity and futility of humanbeings led me to decide that ‘Man’ was a mistranslation for ‘I’; that, in fact,Lao-tse was merely expressing his inability to escape complete solipsism. Icould not (and still do not) accept the view that Taoism is a humanism.My solipsism I had arrived at by reading of Berkeley and Hume in some textbookof philosophy. I remember explaining to a group of friends in the playground atschool why a bar of chocolate existed only in their own minds. Berkeley, addedto Einstein and Eliot’s Hollow Men, made a vertiginous mixture.Then, quite suddenly, my ‘nihilism’ received a check. A day came when Iseriously contemplated suicide. It was during the long, hot summer of 1947, whenI was working as a laboratory assistant. I arrived home one evening in a stateof nervous exhaustion, and tried to ‘write away’ my tension in my journal. Ifound writing simply an aid to reflection, a crutch for my thoughts. And afterabout an hour of writing, I found my resistance slowly returning. I thoughtclearly: This must cease immediately; I will not go on living like this. I wasall too familiar with these revivals of strength that was sucked away again thenext day. Then I saw the answer: Kill myself.It cheered me immensely. I cycled to my evening classes with a feeling of havingat last learned to master my destiny. I arrived late, and listened to theprofessor’s sarcasms without interest. It was our evening for analyticalchemistry practice. A glass tray contained a mixture of powders which we had toseparate. I took some in my watch glass, sniffed it, tested it in a bunsenflame, and then went into the other room to the reagent shelves. Glass bottlescontained cobalt chloride, silver nitrate, potassium iodide and various acids.In the middle there was a bottle of hydrocyanic acid. As I took it down, my mindmade a leap, and for an instant I was living in the future, with a burning in mythroat and in the pit of my stomach. In that moment, I was suddenly supremelyaware that what I wanted was not less life, but more. The sensation of drinkingthe acid was so clear that it was almost as if it had actually taken place. Istood there for a second with the bottle in my hand, but the experience was sovivid that it seemed to last for hours. Then, as someone stood beside me, I putit back, vaguely, as if I had taken it by mistake, and reached down for themethyl red. In one second, I had seen something that I have striven to see allmy life since.My insight that evening did not last for long, perhaps because I was too anxiousto cling to it. I remember the feeling of having been suddenly awakened to thepossibilities of my own will power, and the dreamlike quality of the rest of theevening. And when I got home, I did not try to write about it. For the firsttime, I had a sense of something too real to write about. Later, when I came toanalyse the experience in my journal, I recognised it as one of many suchexperiences which I had had, differing only in degree. I did not discoverHermann Hesse until six years later; I am certain that if I had, Steppenwolfwould have become the bible of my teens. Hesse recognises these fluctuations ofinsight as being the very stuff of the artist’s life. At any time in myadolescence, asked what is the final goal of life, I would have replied withouthesitation: Insight. Later deliberations have made me less certain.My year as a civil servant was the dreariest I had yet known. In my journal, Iwrote that the chief qualification for a tax collector is an ability to simulatework. I hated pretending to file Schedule A forms that did not need filing. Ienvied Shaw when I read in Hesketh Pearson’s biography that he had been soefficient as an office boy that his employers had refused to accept hisresignation. I was frankly incompetent and outspoken about my dislike of thejob. I took half a dozen books to the office every day and read them when I hadfinished filing. In slack periods I slipped out to the local library and stayedthere for hours at a time. I was an appallingly bad office boy. The head of theoffice was a pleasant, middle-aged Londoner; when he had nothing to do he askedme into his office, and ‘talked philosophy’—which meant that he told me long,rambling stories about his life to illustrate his own incorrigibly optimisticpoint of view. Whenever I had to be reprimanded for some oversight or piece ofincompetence—which was pretty frequently—he delegated the job to hissecond-in-command (a good-tempered Scot, who also took a lenient view of myinefficiency). After six months in the Inland Revenue office, I took theexamination for establishment in the Civil Service. I can still remember mydespair when I received the letter congratulating me on having passed. Icelebrated my establishment by writing a long, pessimistic story about the endof the world; I produced it in a single eight-hour sitting one Saturdayafternoon. No one ever liked the story, and I destroyed it later. It wasdistinctly indebted to Wells’s The Star.The only occurrence of importance in my year as a civil servant was my definiteabandonment of Dickens as a master of style. One day, in a state of boredom anddisgust, I began a story in the ‘stream of consciousness’ style and found thatit expressed my emotions so well that from then on I experimented with itcontinually.I had always detested the idea of National Service, but my period in the R.A.F.came as a relief. The first eight weeks of squarebashing were so hectic that Ihad no time to think, and my mental faculties enjoyed the vacation. This wasfollowed by a tedious month spent in a Birmingham training camp, where I hadlittle to do except learn to be a Clerk, General Duties. I had not chosen itmyself—the clerking job—and I resented it. Finally, I was posted to a stationnear Nottingham, and given a little office all to myself, where I was as boredas I had been in the tax office. One day, in a state of wild irritation, I wasthoroughly rude to the adjutant, who, instead of sending for the guard, asked mesympathetically why I disliked office work so much. He hoped to get metransferred to some medical unit where I might exercise my incompetence amongmalingerers who were hoping to escape parades. He had been unlucky in having hada series of inefficient clerks whose oversights had brought unending complaintsfrom G.H.Q., and hoped to exchange me for better or worse. Somehow, he overshothis mark, and a month later I found myself on my way home with my dischargepapers. The whole story is unprintable. I left the R.A.F. with a delightedrecognition that one’s salvation can lie in proceeding to extremes ofindiscretion and ignoring the possible consequences. It was the first time I hadhad a chance of putting Mr. Polly’s advice into practice, and it had worked.The sheer joy of walking out of the R.A.F. gave me a great sense of emotionalrelease. I determined that I would never go back into an office. I sent in myresignation to the Civil Service, and received a long letter pointing out thegravity of what I was doing, and asking me to reconsider it. I stayed at homefor a month until my discharge pay ran out, and then left home with a haversackand hitchhiked north. I had intended to find work, but found myself so reluctantto begin that I delayed until the last of my money was spent. Then I hitchhikedhome again. In my fortnight’s wanderings I had approached a dozen or so theatreswith the idea of training to act in repertory. Luckily, no one had any time forme. At home I worked for a fortnight on a building site, and then set out again,this time travelling southward. I wanted to spend a night at Stonehenge—for noparticular reason—and then head for Southampton, where I hoped I might be ableto get a boat to India. Two R.A.F. policemen saw me emerging from a haystackwearing a grubby R.A.F. uniform (without shoulder flashes) and arrested me. Iexplained that I was not a deserter, but I had no discharge papers and theydidn’t believe me. I was sent home again.I took a number of jobs in quick succession. I worked on a fairground, sellingtickets for a gambling machine. I met a girl with whom I carried on an affairfor the rest of the year. It was my first sexual experience, and it contributedto the tremendously optimistic state of mind that I experienced all that year. Itook a building job that involved wheeling a thousand barrow loads of concrete aday up an inclined plank and along a trench to a half-finished building. After aweek I handed in my notice and took a job in some government scheme for trainingfarm labourers. For the rest of that summer, I worked on various farms inLeicestershire, learning to milk cows—electrically and by hand—make hay, shovelcow dung into barrows, harness and unharness horses, and dislike the Englishcountryside intensely. Luckily, my dislike did not survive my period as a farmhand.I had ceased to read Eliot; I even gave away all his works, alleging that he was‘morbid’ and ‘anti-life.’ Instead, I carried Synge around with me, and readHerrick, Rabelais, Boccaccio, Blake—and, of course, Shaw. I preferred Joyce’sBuck Mulligan to Stephen Dedalus. My interest in comparative religion alsodeveloped, and I read Buddhist and Hindu texts for the first time. My firstreading of the Bhagavad-Gita was so important to me that I had my copy bound inleather and carried it around with me wherever I went. The idea of entering amonastery also became increasingly attractive. Not necessarily a Christianmonastery—I did not count myself a Christian, in the sense of believing inredemption by Christ. Rather, the monastery symbolised serenity and time formeditation. Yeats’s ‘storm-beaten old watch-tower’ would have done as well. Mymost acute problem, I felt, was to discover a means of escaping work, escapingthe complications of having to find food and drink and a change of clothes. Istarted instruction in Catholicism, feeling that to become a Catholic would bethe first step toward a monastery. But what I read of the strenuous life inmonasteries discouraged me. My final disqualification, of course, was my failureto see any need for Christ. The need for God I could understand, and the needfor a religion; I could even sympathise with devotees like Suso or St. Francis,who wove fantasies around the cross, the nails, and all the other traditionalsymbols. But ultimately I could not accept the need for redemption by a Saviour.To pin down the idea of salvation to one point in space and time seemed a naivekind of anthropomorphism, like portraying Lao-tse’s Unchanging with a beard andwhite hair.The solution seemed simpler. As an adolescent, I had been puzzled and madewretched by a feeling that sudden moods of vision and insight—what Wordsworthcalls ‘the glory and the freshness of a dream’—could not be retained or recalledat will. The Buddhist and Hindu scriptures prescribed simple disciplines forretaining them. It was a short step from there to deciding that most men leadsuch dull and second-rate lives because the concept of a spiritual andintellectual discipline is so foreign to them. Even the men who talk about theneed for discipline never practice it; at any rate, this was what I felt at thetime.By the time I had been back in civilian life for six months, I had begun to seemy personal problems more clearly. Previously, my chief enemy had been boredom.I thought I had found an answer when I left the R.A.F. Hitchhiking into Londonfrom Wendover one day, lines from Rupert Brooke running in my head:> Thank God, that’s done! and I’ll take the road,> > Quit of my youth and you,> > The Roman road to Wendover> > By Tring and Lilley Hoo,> > As a free man may do ... 6it had suddenly seemed that the answer was to keep on the move: never to stayanywhere long enough to get bored.* I felt that nothing counted except toachieve the intensity of a visionary, and that the only way to do this was tocare more about it than anything else; to be willing to sacrifice everything tothe ideal.It did not work out. Wandering entailed too much ‘thought for the morrow’; itmade life a perpetual anxiety. In its way, it was as bad as being drained ofone’s vitality in an office job. I wanted to be allowed to meditate and write;but wandering gave me no time or freedom to meditate, while working at a‘regular job’ destroyed the inclination. The alternatives were equallypoisonous. By the end of the summer, I had come to realise that the intolerableproblem of subsistence was still unsolved. Of only one thing I was certain: itwas no use staying at home and hoping. My will had to be constantly stimulatedby new challenges.In September 1950 I decided to go to France. It was not that I wanted to writein a garret on the Left Bank, or seek Murger’s vie de boheme off the rue du Bac.My desire to write had almost died out, and I felt that intellect was a diseasekeeping me away from life. I was not sure what I hoped to find in France, butany movement was better than sitting still in Leicester. I set off to hitchhiketo Dover, working for a week near Canterbury picking hops, and then for afortnight near Dover, picking potatoes. During this second job, the farmerallowed me to sleep in an old cottage that he used for storing the potatoes; Islept in an upstairs room, settling myself in the corner of the floor thatlooked soundest. Most of the floorboards were missing in the rest of the room; Ialways installed myself before dark, and then refrained from moving in case Ifell through into the cellar. At the end of the fortnight, I crossed to France.Altogether, the two months I spent there confirmed my feeling that a lifewithout security is dreary and demoralising. In Paris I lived for a time in the‘Akademia’ of Raymond Duncan, brother of the dancer Isadora. He was a naivelyegotistic old American who printed his own Whitmanesque poems on a printingpress that only had capital letters and issued a weekly newspaper calledNew-Paris-York, written entirely by himself in bad French. His long grey hairwas fastened by a band around his forehead and he wore a toga and sandals. Hepreached a philosophy which he called ‘actionalism,’ which was a blend ofRousseauism and the commonsense practical beliefs of a self-made man who hadonce been a millionaire. He supported himself—like some mediaeval craftsman—bymaking things with his hands, and taught his ‘disciples’ (of whom I was enrolledas one) to do the same. He preached that a poet would be a better poet for beingable to mend a lavatory cistern or dig a trench with a pick. For a few weeks Ihelped him to print his newspaper, and in exchange was given three vegetarianmeals a day and a couch to sleep on (I had my own blankets). But he soon foundme out—that the three meals a day meant more to me than the lectures which hedelivered twice a week to selected audiences. He gave me a stiff dressing down,in which he told me that I was an adventurer and an impostor, and gave metwenty-four hours to find new lodgings. I was not resentful; it was true that myown approach had nothing in common with the diluted Platonism that he preached.When I had first come to the ‘Akademia’ I had hoped to interest Duncan in my ownattitude; but it was useless. He was good-natured and easygoing, but old; tooold to be interested in me; too old even to talk to me for more than a fewminutes at a time. So, after a while, his hospitality began to weigh on myconscience, and the summary dismissal brought an element of relief.I left for Strasbourg, where I had a pen friend with whom I had correspondedsince I was fourteen. But my luck was no better there. Since I had last seenhim, he had joined the Communist Party. In England, three years before, he hadstruck me as a fool. In three years, his Marxism had become an impregnablearmour, and my own religious attitude had developed correspondingly. At firstthere was some talk of my staying in Strasbourg and working for his father—a ragmerchant—but as our discussions became more heated and less friendly, this ideawas dropped. Within a fortnight we could barely tolerate one another. One day,after a particularly sharp clash of our views, I went to the British consulateand borrowed enough money to return to England. Late the next day, I was back inLeicester. It was a few weeks before Christmas.My three months’ wandering, considered in retrospect, had given me a pleasantsensation of liberty, but I realised that none of my problems had been solved,and that I would never discover freedom by becoming a tramp. During the previoussummer, when I had worked on farms, I had thought of certain poems of Synge, orcertain pages in Hemingway—the El Sordo episode, for instance—and had beenpossessed by an imaginative vision of freedom—a feeling that I could escape theprison of my own personality in the impersonality of other places, in the‘otherness’ of the world. It was a romantic vision—it owed something to thoselast pages of Ulysses, where Mrs. Bloom suddenly becomes the earth spinningaround the sun, and speaks of the ‘flowers on her breast’ crushed by her lovers.And it was hardly to be realised by crossing to France without money. But atleast I had learnt that freedom could be discovered in retrospect, by‘recollecting in tranquillity’ the episodes which had seemed so uninspiring atthe time—such as reading the Phaedo while sitting at the roadside nearVitry-le-François, waiting for a lift. For a few weeks, I felt like a visitor inLeicester, and the place no longer oppressed me.But not for long. I needed a job, and my father gave me a long lecture aboutwasting my time on manual labour; in his eyes, my resignation from the CivilService was the most foolish act of my life. In deference to him, I again tookan office job—this time in a large engineering works in Leicester. The pay wasmiserable, and after a few days, I began to hate the job as I have always hatedwork. Being in Leicester, working in a regular job, made me feel aimless, androbbed me of my sense of purpose. I have no doubt that I would have drifted backinto my affair with the girl I had known previously, but while I was abroad shehad thrown me over, and I was disgusted to find how much it hurt. However, Ibegan to flirt with the works nurse, a slim, shy girl, ten years my senior, andI felt pleased at the way in which I appeared to have mastered my emotions.The job followed the familiar pattern. The first few days there—the days Idreaded most—passed unexpectedly easily. Everything was new, and the officestaff were pleasant. Part of my job involved walking around the works—theycovered an enormous area—and delivering invoices to various departments. I likedto watch the red-hot metal being pounded by the steam hammer, or see long barsof it being cut into chunks. I especially liked watching it after dusk, when thegreat doors of the shop stood open, and the red glow made the half-naked menseem beautiful. In the shop where the white-hot metal was poured into moulds, itwas necessary to stand near the doors, in case the splashes burnt holes in myclothes.At the time, I was reading a great deal of Blake—I had only discovered him sixmonths before, through reading Joyce Cary’s The Horse’s Mouth—and the atmosphereof the Prophetic Books was well suited to that of the engineering works, forthey were also full of talk of molten metal and hammers ringing on iron. Icarried a copy of Blake with me all the time, and repeated it to myself as Iwalked around the works:> For every Space larger than a red Globule of Man’s blood> > Is visionary, and is created by the Hammer of Los:> > And every Space smaller than a Globule of Man’s blood opens> > Into Eternity of which this vegetable Earth is but a shadow.7It snowed a lot that December. Some evenings, walking around the works, pickingmy way over girders covered with powdered snow, moving towards the white glowthat came from the welding shops, the world would suddenly seem altogether good,no longer alien, and my feeling of self-contempt would vanish.All the same, I began to hate the job. As soon as I grew used to it, I began towork automatically. I fought hard against this process. I would spend theevening reading poetry, or writing, and would determine that with sufficientmental effort I could stop myself from growing bored and indifferent at work thenext day. But the moment I stepped through the office door in the morning, thefamiliar smell and appearance would switch on the automatic pilot whichcontrolled my actions. The longer I stayed in the job the more impossible itbecame. Moments of insight became less frequent than ever. Repetition makes oneinto a machine, and all responses become automatic. But the important part ofman—the creative part—is the part that is spontaneous. To escape the feeling ofbeing a machine—to try to jar my being out of its automatic responses—I triedall kinds of exercise: getting up an hour earlier in the morning, and going forlong runs in running shorts and tennis shoes; sleeping on the floor rather thanin bed; sitting up in my bedroom half the night, cross-legged, trying toconcentrate until I had broken the feeling of being merely another ‘socialanimal’; staying out until three o’clock in the morning and running all the wayhome. But the longer I stayed in the job, the harder it became to escape theintolerable sense of being what society wished to make me, merely another humanbeing in the human anthill.Yet this problem of automatism is the problem of life itself. In childhood werespond freshly to everything, and nothing is automatic, but as we get older,life becomes more complex, and a part of our activities has to be handed over tothe ‘automatic pilot.’ At first, new experiences stimulate us; after a while, noexperience is new; it is intercepted by the automatic pilot. I am convinced thatpeople die because they cease to want to live; what purpose is there in livingwhen nothing challenges or stimulates us any longer, when everything is done bythe automatic pilot? In my early teens, I had a terrible suspicion that wisdommeant becoming old and losing the desire to live; that the only way to live fora long time was to be so foolish that all sorts of trivial issues continued toexcite one into old age, as an imbecile is excited by a child’s playthings. Itwas not until I was eighteen, and read the Bhagavad-Gita, that this suspicionfinally loosened its hold on me, and I recognised that the visionary disciplineshimself to see the world always as if he had only just seen it for the firsttime.At all events, the office job beat me. No amount of discipline could prevent mefrom feeling abysmally depressed within a minute of entering the office. Even myfriendship with the nurse did not compensate for it; nor did the novel that Ihad begun to write, situated in Strasbourg and heavily indebted to Hemingway,nor the play inspired by Granville-Barker’s The Secret Life, nor the half-dozenother literary projects I had started work on at this time. I stuck the jobuntil shortly after Christmas and then gave in my notice. I visited theLeicester Corporation offices and got myself another navvying job, whichinvolved travelling miles to work every morning, and then working knee-deep inmud, digging trenches. I had hoped the hardship would stimulate me, but within aday or two I disliked navvying as much as I had disliked the office. It was freetime that I wanted. One day I suddenly conceived the idea of asking theLeicester Corporation whether they would object if I worked for only three daysa week. It seemed a brilliant idea to me; it would have meant foregoing pocketmoney, but the amount of free time I should create for myself would more thancompensate. At first, the Corporation agreed; then they changed their minds,pointing out that the other men would object. In fury and disgust, I gave thejob up and took another in a chemical factory.I had got into the habit of reciting poetry as I worked. I liked the poetry ofSynge, and that poem of Gogarty’s that begins:> I will live in Ringsend> > With a red-headed whore ...It expressed my new anti-intellectual attitude. I liked also to repeat the warpoems of Wilfred Owen, especially ‘Exposure’ and ‘Futility.’ The active physicaltorment in the poems was a relief to my feeling of being stifled intrivialities. For the same reason, I looked at the painting of Van Gogh and readall I could find on his life, and read Nijinsky’s Diary continually. The conceptof the Outsider first began to form in my mind, and I started to use the word inmy journals. I had to concentrate on the idea of torment and horror to obtainrelease from my sense of futility and pettiness.But soon fresh complications were to alter my life completely. It now becomesimpossible to tell the story fully, for it ceases to be my own story alone, andbecomes that of myself and my wife—I married in the June of that year. Mymarriage—to the nurse—brought no answer to the problems; in fact, onlyintensified them, since I was now forced to support a wife—and later a son—aswell as myself. There would be no point in telling of this marriage in detail.For eighteen months I worked in factories in London, and we moved from home tohome with dismal regularity. The new feeling of security, of having a wife and ahome, stimulated me to write, and I spent all my free time writing a novel abouttwo Outsiders, one based on Nietzsche, and the other on Jack the Ripper. At theend of eighteen months, we separated ‘temporarily’ while I looked for anotherhome for us; but the separation lengthened, while I spent more time writing mynovel and a play than looking for rooms. I was working at this time as a porterin a hospital in Fulham. Finally, I got sick of the portering job—whichinvolved, mostly, wheeling live patients to the wards and dead ones to themortuary—and went to Paris again. But the problem of working for a living wasnot solved until the following year, when I had returned to London. In a fewmonths I went through a series of jobs rapidly—a laundry, two office jobs (bothfirms sacked me), a plastic factory and a Lyons Corner House. Then, one day, theidea came to me that I was earning far more money than I strictly needed to keepalive. I earned £5 or £6 a week. Of this, 30s. was spent in rent, £2 or so onfood, and the rest was sent to my wife, or spent on books and bus fares. Ireasoned that of these, food is the only absolute necessity. One can buy a tentfor 30s., and provide a roof over one’s head. And a bicycle can make bus faresunnecessary. The tent idea excited me. It seemed a perfect solution—for summer,at all events. So I gave up my rooms (or rather, my landlady threw me out aftera disagreement) and bought a tent. I did not give up work immediately: I wasmaking a great deal of money by working overtime in a plastic factory inWhetstone. But I saved rent by setting up my tent at nights on a golf linksopposite the factory. After a while, I realised that to put up a tent and takeit down every day was an unnecessary labour. A waterproof sleeping bag wouldserve as well. So I bought one, together with an eiderdown sleeping bag, animmense army frame rucksack for my belongings, and a bicycle with a carrier onthe back. In a few weeks, I had saved enough money to leave work with acertainty of not having to return for a few months provided my expenditure didnot exceed £2 a week. I moved my quarters from the golf links to HampsteadHeath, and cycled down to the British Museum every day, to work from nine tillfive. I was making a determined effort to reduce some of the immense manuscriptof my Jack the Ripper novel to publishable form. Mr. Angus Wilson, who at thattime was an official in the Reading Room, noticed me writing furiously, andoffered to read the manuscript when it was completed, and, if he liked it, tosubmit it to his publisher.But sleeping out was a nerve-racking business. I did not dare to go onto theHeath until after midnight; there were too many young lovers about. The policepatrolled the Heath, but they stuck to the paths and only occasionally flashed apowerful torch around. I sometimes slept till ten (the Heath is a surprisinglyquiet place on weekday mornings), and was often wakened by someone’s dogsniffing at my face, or voices in the distance. Usually, I had breakfast at abusman’s café at the bottom of Haverstock Hill: they did a remarkably cheapslice of bread and dripping and an enormous mug of tea for 2½d. The day in theMuseum usually went by too quickly; but the evenings were the difficult time.After eight o’clock all the libraries were closed; there was nowhere where onecould spend a few hours in warmth and quiet until midnight. A girl whom I hadmet in Leicester the previous Christmas was also in London at the time. She keptall my books for me, and sometimes entertained me in the evening; but it was toomuch to expect her to have to put up with me every evening. Her help andsympathy were invaluable; but all the same, I always felt exhausted and ill atease as I cycled around London with my sleeping bags rolled up on the back; itwas a strange sensation, having nowhere to go, nowhere to retire to at nights,nowhere to spend the evening reading. Besides, the girl’s landladies objected ifI turned up too often; they left her little notes telling her not to let me usethe bathroom, and that I had to be out by ten o’clock.Occasionally during that summer I ran out of cash. Then I had to take a job fora few weeks: one in Lyons, one in a dairy at Chiswick. I continued writing thebook well into the autumn. In early November the weather became so bad that Iwas finally driven indoors. I took a room at New Cross, and another job inLyons. At this time I was seeing a great deal of another young writer, StuartHolroyd, whom I had met the previous year. He talked vaguely of writing acritical book, and advised me to do the same; but I was too busy at the time,trying to finish the first part of my novel (it was to be in three short parts).I had heard a rumour that Angus Wilson intended leaving the Museum, and I wantedto be able to hand him the typewritten manuscript before he left. At Christmasthat year I worked at the post office in St.-Martin’s-le-Grand, sortingChristmas mail; by doing overtime, I made enough money to buy a secondhandtypewriter. Over Christmas, alone in London, I finally completed the first partof the novel, and immediately settled down to typing it. A week later, lack ofmoney made it necessary to find another job. There were long queues in thelabour exchange, and only a few unskilled labouring jobs available. I acceptedthe first one they offered me—as I usually do—and the next day started to workin a laundry in Deptford. The job was so peculiarly detestable, and theconditions so appalling, that I overcame my usual laziness and cycled intoLondon every day, trying to find evening work in a coffee bar. The laundrybecame completely intolerable to me when one day my journal was stolen out of mypocket. It had contained the entries of over a year past, and its loss enragedme. But the day after this happened, I found a job in a newly opened coffee barin the Haymarket; I was the washer-up.Compared with the laundry, conditions there were delightful. The kitchen was newand shiny and chromium-plated, and the food was unlimited and very good. Iworked every evening from five-thirty till midnight, and had the day free towrite. I finished typing the first part of the novel in a burst of energy, andhanded it to Angus Wilson on the day he left the Museum. And then, suddenly, Ifelt a little lost. For many years, the novel had occupied my thoughts.Suddenly, it had gone out of my hands. If Angus found it bad, I would begin allover again. In the meantime, there was no point in going on with it. I began towonder what I should do to occupy my days in the Reading Room.It was at this point that Stuart Holroyd showed me the opening chapters of hisEmergence from Chaos. Suddenly, I made a decision. I too would write a criticalbook—a credo. I would dash it off quickly, and then get back to the novel. Inhalf an hour, one morning, I sketched out the plan of a book, to be called TheOutsider in Literature. It would be a study in various types of ‘obsessed men.’I immediately jotted down a list of the type of men who would interest me. Someimmediately came to mind: Van Gogh, T. E. Lawrence, George Fox, Boehme, Joyce,Nijinsky (I had written a long essay on Nijinsky several years before, which Ihad sent to Madame Nijinsky. She had replied kindly to a preliminary letter ofmine, but never acknowledged the essay.) There were obviously many differenttypes of Outsider. Some were men of action, some were the very reverse. So therewould be a chapter on Oblomov and Hamlet and Hesse’s Steppenwolf and the GreatGatsby. These would be classified together as ‘weak Outsiders.’ Then there wouldbe a chapter on Goethe’s Faust, Mann’s Doctor Faustus, and Dostoevsky’s IvanKaramazov, from whom Mann drew in his own scene between Leverkühn and the Devil.A great deal of the book would also be devoted to religious figures: Boehme,Law, Fox, Newman, Luther, Wycliffe—all rebels against their time. The Outsidershades off one way into the weakling—the Hamlet—and the other way into theRebel. Then there were the French Existentialists, and Heidegger and Jaspers—andof course, Kierkegaard—and these pointed to a tie-up with Nietzsche, while thestudy of pessimism would link up with Schopenhauer and Spengler. As I jotteddown names, and pushed them around to try to find some logical order for themall, I realised with growing despair that there was no order that would embraceall of them—or at least, if there were, the book would be so vast that it wouldinvolve ten years’ work. There was no point in being overwhelmed by it andtrying to see it as a whole before I began it. I had been doing that with thenovel for years, and here, with over half a million words written, had only ahundred pages in their final form. I decided to begin the book that afternoon inthe Museum. On my way down there, I remembered a volume which I had read aboutyears before in the Everyman edition of Le Feu—Barbusse’s L’Enfer. That wouldmake a perfect starting point: the man who looks at life through a hole in hiswall. In the Museum, I got the book and settled down to read it. In two hours Ihad finished it. It was within half an hour of closing time. Hastily, I lookedup a striking sentence which I had noticed and copied it on to a sheet of paper:‘In the air, on top of a tram, a girl is sitting ... ’ I copied on hastily untilthe bell rang for closing time. The next morning, I wrote on to the end of myanalysis of Barbusse, and without hesitation, plunged into H. G. Wells’s Mind atthe End of Its Tether (of which I had had a copy since I was sixteen).Once I actually started, I wrote quickly. I had written as far as the Lawrencechapter before I stopped for breath. I then reread my manuscript, and decidedthat it began too abruptly and proceeded too fast. I wrote an introduction,which began by quoting T. E. Hulme’s prophecy of the decay of humanism, andstating that this book was to be an attack on humanism and an attempt to basethe religious attitude on reasonable foundations. Hulme had promised to write adefence of his religious attitude, but had been killed in the war. I stated myintention of attempting to write the book that Hulme had never written; mymethod would not be philosophical, but psychological; not an attempt to provethe existence of God, but a search for meaning in human life.At about this time I was offered a daytime job that involved no more thansitting at a desk and answering a telephone if it rang. It seldom rang more thantwice a day; and I sat there for four hours a day, writing furiously and beingpaid 3s. an hour for writing. In this early stage, the book was called The PainThreshold. One day, I installed my typewriter in the office and typed the threechapters that I had written. When I had typed the Introduction (which did notappear in the published version) I sent it to a publisher. To my delight, hereplied within twenty-four hours, expressing interest. I sent him the threechapters as soon as they were typed. This time, he took longer but finally wroteto say that he would definitely publish the book. I was delighted, but it was notime to give way to the pleasure of having been ‘accepted.’ I suspected that Icould not finish the book as well as I had begun it, and that the publisherwould change his mind when he read it as a whole. Now I had started typing thebook, I became too lazy to write it first and type later, and began to use atypewriter all the time. Three months later it was finished. The advance which Ireceived enabled me, for the first time in my life, to give up work and donothing but write.By this time Angus Wilson had returned the novel, with the comment: ‘I like it.Go on and finish it.’ But I found creative work appallingly difficult after theeasy writing of the critical book. The writing of The Pain Threshold had notmade the novel any easier; every section seemed to need a dozen rewrites. Istruggled on slowly, and managed to finish it in six months. But having finishedit, I could hardly bear to reread it, and decided to start from the beginningagain. The Pain Threshold was due out in a month, and I had tentativelysuggested calling it The Outsider (tentatively, because I knew of two otherbooks with the same title—Camus’s and Richard Wright’s). Reading the proofs ofThe Outsider had made me terribly dissatisfied with it: I hadn’t managed to putin half as many things as I wanted, or to pursue half as many lines of thought.It needed, I realised, the same care and patience as the novel. Besides, I hadbegun to read Arnold Toynbee’s Study of History and a great deal more ofWhitehead, and I saw that the argument could be developed much further.The success of the book winded me, and made me more certain than ever that itshould have been twice as long and far more carefully planned. I had believedpassionately in the book, and had never doubted its importance as I wrote it.But it was intended as essentially a preliminary step towards a far biggerstatement. After the delight of the first good reviews, and the knowledge thatnew impressions were being called for, I became aware of what had happened tothe book itself. I was congratulated by critics on having started a craze, oninventing a new parlour game to replace Nancy Mitford’s ‘U and Non-U,’ called‘Outsider or Insider?’ The whirl and publicity went on for months, and soon Irealised that I had become a stranger to my own book. The people in it, who foryears had seemed to live with me, had suddenly become alien; a painting by VanGogh no longer moved me; Nijinsky’s Diary stayed on my shelf unread. It wasinteresting to hear people discussing me—as when a child falls into a doze at aparty, and hears the grownups talking about him—but only because it was likeseeing myself in distorting mirrors. Besides, after a while, people beganattacking the book, and declaring that it had all been a mistake, and that I wasnot a ‘promising young writer’ after all.No doubt they were right. Although I have always used writing as a medium toclarify my thoughts, I have never thought of myself as primarily a writer.Writing is an instrument of my main purpose, and that purpose is my own businessand no one else’s. I am convinced, like my ‘Outsider,’ that all men who haveever lived have been failures. As a child, I thought of every adult I met: Ishan’t waste my life like that. This problem is the impetus that drives myliving, and my writing is merely one discipline for solving it. The answer seemsto lie in achieving a certain state of mind called ‘vision’; and above all otherthings I prefer to study the evidence that men have left of their moments ofvision: Nietzsche’s glimpse on the hilltop, Van Gogh’s Green Cornfield, Pascal’sMemorial, Boehme’s ‘pewter dish,’ the moment of great insight in which thepurpose of all life is seen. Ultimately, this is the only thing worth achieving.Yeats called life ‘a vast preparation for something that never happens,’ and yetone minute of such vision could turn all preparation into achievement.These visions and the men who saw them occupy all my time and attention. Tofacilitate my own study of them, I wrote about them more or less consecutivelyin The Outsider (as I have been writing about them haphazardly for years in myjournals). For myself, The Outsider and the present book are a sort of extensionof my journals, a part of my working notes. I am grateful that their publicationhas made me enough money to allow me to continue to work on for a few moreyears; but their publication was not an essential part of my purpose. I am notnecessarily a writer. The moment writing ceases to be a convenient disciplinefor subduing my stupidity and laziness, I shall give it up and turn to some morepractical form. I wish this to be understood because I find that being regardedas a ‘promising young writer,’ or attacked as a charlatan or a woolly-mindedfreak, tends to destroy my certainty of purpose. The prospect of spending mylife trying to make myself worthy of a few pages in The Cambridge History ofEnglish Literature seems to me a particularly dreary kind of treadmill. I seenow that I must try to escape the subtle falsifications of my aims that thesuccess of The Outsider caused. I must retrace my steps to the period before itwas published, and begin working again from there. In those days, I had a planfor drafting a vast critical credo that should define the area of my interest,to be followed by a series of novels and plays in which the Outsider idea wouldbe explored in all its existentialist implications. But the idea of writingbooks merely because I am now known as a ‘writer’ is repellent to me.Temperamentally, my sympathy is still with Novalis and Jean Paul Sartre andother deniers of the daylight, and to know that anything is expected anddemanded of me is enough to make me detest it.A few words should be said about the plan of this book. It has given me far moretrouble to write than The Outsider, for the subject is far more complex. In thefirst chapter, I have tried to present the outline of The Outsider in aconcentrated form, and to emphasise that what I mean by existentialism covers abroader field than what Kierkegaard or Heidegger or Sartre mean by it; myexistentialism is closer to Goethe’s idea of Bildung. I have tried to underlinethis by illustrating my thesis with analyses of Rilke, Rimbaud and ScottFitzgerald; the last because he is, in all essentials, a man of the twentiethcentury.In the second chapter, the central theme of this book appears for the firsttime: the decline of Western civilisation. The chapter is devoted to analyses ofSpengler and Toynbee.The second part of the book swings back to the problem of the Outsider, and hisattempt to become an Insider by accepting a religious solution: Boehme,Swedenborg, Pascal, Ferrar, Law, Newman, Kierkegaard and Shaw are all examinedand their solutions scrutinised. Shaw is deliberately included in the list of‘religious Outsiders’ to emphasise that he is not quite the lone phenomenon thatmodern critics seem to believe, and to demonstrate his affinities with otheranti-materialist thinkers since the sixteenth century.In the final chapter of this book, the two lines of thought—the religious andthe historical—converge in a consideration of the thought of two majortwentieth-century philosophers—Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alfred North Whitehead,and the paradox that Wittgenstein was an Outsider in his life but not in hisphilosophy, while Whitehead led an Insider’s life and yet created the onlyuniquely English brand of Outsider philosophy.This book is still not a final solution of the problems that preoccupy me—howcould it be? Rather, it is the opening of a new line of thought that increasesthe problems I have already raised in The Outsider. But at least I have tried toanswer the accusation that the Outsider concept is just an intellectual fad,with no real relevance to the problems of the world in the twentieth century.The conclusions are pessimistic, as far as Western civilisation is concerned.And since the world is now a smaller place, where all civilisations areinterwoven, it is difficult not to feel that this pessimism implicates the wholehuman race. Logically, this conclusion is difficult to avoid. Yet my owntemperament has a vein of optimism that is not crushed by these reflections,although I am hard put to it to say why. Perhaps I have simply failed to graspmy own conclusions.In any case, my business is clear: to present my vision as capably as I can, andthen to carry my sense of urgency back into my own personal life. There is alimit beyond which discursive thought cannot go, and for the moment, I havereached my own limit.* vide The Outsider, pp. 123-4.* See Notes on pp. 323 ff.* The Outsider, Chap. 8, pp. 209-10.* After writing this, I was interested to find a passage in Nietzsche’sMorgenrote that expresses precisely the same attitude: ‘I will rather emigrateand try to become master of fresh countries and, above all, of myself, changingmy abode as often as any danger of slavery threatens me; not avoid adventure andwar, and be prepared for death if the worst happens—but no more of this indecentserfdom, this irritation, malice and rebelliousness.’"},{"pageContent":"PART ONE"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE—THE ANATOMY OF IMAGINATIONThere is a case in Taylor’s Medical Jurisprudence of a man who committed suicideby burning himself to death. He lay on a straw mattress, and lit a candleunderneath. Periodically, he got off the mattress, and noted down his sensationson a sheet of paper on the bedside table. In the morning, when his charred bodywas discovered on the completely burnt mattress, the note was found. He wanted,he explained, to prove once and for all that suicides are not necessarilycowards. He had chosen this method to demonstrate it.This is the image of the Outsider: a man whose passion for observation andexperiment does not stop, even when it is a question of experimenting with hisown death.In Granville-Barker’s The Secret Life, Strowde had quoted the words of Elijah:‘O Lord, take away my life, for I am not better than my fathers.’ In thatsentence is summarised what is, for the Outsider, the whole tragedy of living.Men come and go, and society changes; civilisations rise and fall, but menalways remain as stupid. In a chorus of The Rock, Eliot asks:> Where is the Life we have lost in living? 1But for the Outsider, all men lose their lives in living them. All men arefailures.In The Outsider, I treated that consciousness of failure, of loss. Sevenchapters of the book aimed at presenting and documenting, as fully as possible,the concept of the futility of human life, and also at trying to pinpoint theOutsider’s occasional sense of a way out of the futility. In the two finalchapters of the book, I tried to give a sketch of certain positive attempts tosolve the problems of the Outsider. These attempts pointed to a religioussolution, but one which was only outlined. In the present book, I hope topresent such a solution more fully.The Outsider, then, is a man who is haunted by a sense of the futility of life.Most of the modern Outsiders I dealt with felt that there was no way out of thisimpasse. But to some degree, a closer examination showed that this attitude isdue to the peculiar conditions of our civilisation. Spiritual standards havealmost ceased to exist, and Freud and Karl Marx have done a thorough job ofconvincing us that all men are much the same, subject to the same kind ofpsychological and economic pressures. If the modern Outsider finds the world anunrelieved prospect of futility, it is because his training and conditioningmake it difficult for him to see any meaning in the notion of increasedintensity of mind. And this is the key to all religion.Like The Outsider, this book will be a case book. But most of the emphasis willno longer be on the sense of misery and futility. In The Outsider, a formula wasarrived at: The Outsider’s salvation lies in extremes. One could rephrase that:The Outsider only ceases to be an Outsider when he becomes possessed, when hebecomes fanatically obsessed by the need to escape.The Outsider could be compared to a man who has been hypnotised, and loweredinto a cage full of apes. The hypnosis prevents him from understanding why hefinds the apes disgusting and stupid. He only knows that he detests them. Hebelieves he is an ape too. His solution lies in deliberately fighting thehypnosis, in telling himself: I am not an ape; I must be something more than anape. A difficult matter if his hypnosis—his conditioning as an ape—inclines himto give up the struggle and become ‘a member of the simian race’ and a goodcitizen of the ape community.The Outsider’s despair, in fact, comes from his vision of the vast sea ofmediocrity that makes up humankind, and his rebellion at the idea of belongingto it. The perfect example of this attitude is in Swift, whose loathing of humanbeings has frequently been called ‘pathological,’ insane, psychotic—although toany Outsider, it looks reasonable and normal enough. W. B. Yeats, who hadprofound insight into Swift (as his play The Words Upon the Window-Paneproves),* has characterised him in two lines:> Swift beating on his breast in sibylline frenzy blind> > Because the heart in his blood-sodden breast has dragged him down into mankind> 2When the Outsider is in his earliest stages—when he does not know himself orunderstand why he is ‘out of harmony’ with the rest of humankind—his hatred formen and the world makes him an unbalanced misfit, a man full of spite and envy,neurotic, cowardly, shrinking and wincing. His salvation depends upon theachievement of self-understanding, self-knowledge. It is only when he begins tofind himself that he realises that his hatred is perfectly justified: a healthyreaction to a world of sick half-men.But now there is an important new development, which I barely touched on in TheOutsider. It can best be explained, perhaps, by referring to Peter Keegan, theOutsider priest in John Bull’s Other Island. In this play, it will beremembered, Tom Broadbent, a typical bourgeois Englishman, goes to Rosscullen,in the west of Ireland, to take over some property from a landlord who cannotpay off the mortgage. He goes into a country of early-stage Outsiders, andShaw’s evocation of them is superb; Doyle, Broadbent’s Irish partner, explains:> Here [in England] if the life is dull, you can be dull too, and no great harm> done. (Going off into a passionate dream) But your wits cant thicken in that> soft moist air, on those white springy roads, in those misty rushes and brown> bogs, on those hillsides of granite rocks and magenta heather. Youve no such> colors in the sky, no such lure in the distances, no such sadness in the> evenings. Oh, the dreaming! the dreaming! the torturing, heart-scalding, never> satisfying dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming! (Savagely) No debauchery> that ever coarsened and brutalised an Englishman can take the worth and the> usefulness out of him like that dreaming. An Irishman’s imagination never lets> him alone, never convinces him, never satisfies him; but it makes him that he> cant face reality nor deal with it nor handle it nor conquer it: he can only> sneer at them that do ... t’s all dreaming, all imagination. He cant be> religious. The inspired Churchman that teaches him the sanctity of life and> the importance of conduct is sent away empty; while the poor village priest> that gives him a miracle or a sentimental story of a saint, has cathedrals> built for him out of the pennies of the poor. He cant be intelligently> political; he dreams of what the Shan Van Vocht said in ninety eight. ... It> saves thinking. It saves working. It saves everything except imagination,> imagination, imagination; and imagination’s such a torture that you cant bear> it without whisky. (With fierce shivering self-contempt) At last you get that> you can bear nothing real at all: youd rather starve than cook a meal; youd> rather go shabby and dirty than set your mind to take care of your clothes and> wash yourself; you nag and squabble at home because your wife isnt an angel,> and she despises you because youre not a hero; and you hate the whole lot> around you, because theyre only poor slovenly useless devils like yourself ...> 3This, it will be seen at once, is a perfect characterisation of the Outsider asI described him in the early chapters of that book: the Barbusse Outsider, theAxel: the whole subject of Goncharov’s Oblomov (the Russian Hamlet who justcannot bring himself to do anything), and of all the work of Samuel Beckett fromMalone (Beckett’s Oblomov) to En Attendant Godot. (There is also, perhaps, anelement of hitting-out at Yeats in this passage: Yeats of The Land of Heart’sDesire and the dreamy fairyland of the early poems. Shaw wrote the playoriginally for the Abbey theatre.)In Rosscullen, Broadbent meets Peter Keegan, the strange, mystical priest, whospends his evenings dreaming by the Round Tower, and the conflict between theircharacters becomes, perhaps, the centre of the play. Keegan is generallysupposed to be mad: the legend being that he once confessed a ‘black heathen’ onhis deathbed, and that when the devil came for the heathen’s soul, he took offKeegan’s head and turned it round three times before putting it on again; andthat Keegan’s head has been turned ever since! In the scene in which Keegan andBroadbent meet for the first time, Doyle asks Keegan the true version of thislegend. Keegan tells him:> ... I heard that a black man was dying, and that the people were afraid to go> near him. When I went to the place I found an elderly Hindoo, who told me one> of those tales of unmerited misfortune, of cruel ill luck, of relentless> persecution by destiny, which sometimes wither the commonplaces of consolation> on the lips of a priest. But this man did not complain of his misfortunes.> They were brought upon him, he said, by sins committed in a former existence.> Then, without a word of comfort from me, he died with a clear-eyed resignation> that my most earnest exhortations have rarely produced in a Christian, and> left me sitting there by his bedside with the mystery of this world suddenly> revealed to me.> > BROADBENT: That is a remarkable tribute to the liberty of conscience enjoyed> by the subjects of our Indian Empire.> > LARRY: No doubt; but may we venture to ask what is the mystery of this world?> > KEEGAN: This world, sir, is very clearly a place of torment and penance, a> place where the fool flourishes and the good and wise are hated and> persecuted, a place where men and women torture one another in the name of> love; where children are scourged and enslaved in the name of parental duty> and education; where the weak in body are poisoned and mutilated in the name> of healing, and the weak in character are put to the horrible torture of> imprisonment, not for hours but for years, in the name of justice. It is a> place where the hardest toil is a welcome refuge from the horror and tedium of> pleasure, and where charity and good works are done only for hire to ransom> the souls of the spoiler and the sybarite. Now, sir, there is only one place> of horror and torment known to my religion; and that place is hell. Therefore> it is plain to me that this earth of ours must be hell, and that we are all> here, as the Indian revealed to me—perhaps he was sent to reveal it to me—to> expiate crimes committed by us in a former existence ...> > BROADBENT: Your idea is a very clever one, Mr. Keegan: really most brilliant> ... But it seems to me ... that you are overlooking the fact that of the evils> you describe, some are absolutely necessary for the preservation of society,> and others are encouraged only when the Tories are in office ... I find the> world quite good enough for me: rather a jolly place, in fact.> > KEEGAN (Looking at him with quiet wonder): You are satisfied?> > BROADBENT: As a reasonable man, yes. I see no evils in the world—except, of> course, natural evils—that cannot be remedied by freedom, self-government, and> English institutions. I think so, not because I am an Englishman, but as a> matter of common sense.> > KEEGAN: You feel at home in the world, then?> > BROADBENT: Of course. Dont you?> > KEEGAN (from the very depths of his nature): No.> > BROADBENT (breezily): Try phosphorus pills. I always take them when my brain> is overworked ... 4This passage is supremely important in Shaw, because it so clearly defines thedifference between the Insider’s and the Outsider’s positions. The Outsider wasShaw’s lifelong preoccupation (as I shall try to show in a later chapter); infact, the first use of the word ‘Outsider’ that I know (in the sense in which Iuse it) occurs in Shaw’s preface to Immaturity. But most important is Keegan’sdoctrine of hell. Keegan’s speech ‘This world ... is clearly a place oftorment,’ might have been placed in the mouth of Ivan Karamazov at the end ofthat terrible chapter in which he describes the torture and ill-treatment ofchildren: in fact, the belief that this world is hell is perfectly consistentwith the Outsider’s vision of it. This was touched upon in The Outsider, whereit frequently became apparent that the Outsider’s vision of the world is avision of torment, sordidness, misery, sudden death, and everlasting insecurity.(See, for example, Hemingway’s works, and La Nausée, Crime and Punishment.) TheOutsider’s hatred of men, his contempt for ‘the Life we have lost in living,’does not become objective until he realises that something is wrong with the wayall men live. The ordinary businessman, the statesman, the professor, does notsee man as a creature of possibilities. He sees other men as rather likehimself—limited, narrow, but capable of minor achievements with more efficientbusiness training, better social organisation, improved education. The Outsider,with his instinctive urge to become more-than-man (just as the hypnotised manwanted to become more-than-ape) feels the need to place man against some greatercanvas than mere human beings—to see him in relation to his greatest spiritualpossibilities. The Outsider’s instincts, once he has got them disentangled fromhis misery and frustration, are the instincts of the spiritual explorer, thespiritual reformer.Broadbent’s vision is humanistic. He thinks in terms of education andliberalism—human progress through material prosperity. Keegan’s is religious; hegoes even further than the religious teachers who point out that it is a badbargain to gain the world and lose your own soul; he claims that if you gainedthe world, you would only have gained hell.It is true that his idea of hell is more like that of the Buddhist than theChristian. In the Buddhist doctrine, the penalty for sin and worldliness is tobe reborn in a lower form of life—as an ape, for instance—and in this, theBuddhist shows a profound grasp of the reality of mental torment. Spiritual hellis to place a man of high abilities and great talent in a position where he willbe frustrated and bored, denied self-expression. It is, in short, the Outsider’sposition in the world.The idea of hell is fundamental to the Outsider’s way of thinking. He lives in aworld of apes, whom he detests. He is told that ‘religion’ consists in lovingyour neighbour as yourself, and in practising the virtues of patience andcharity. The most the Outsider can say is that he dislikes his neighbour just alittle more than he dislikes himself. Most human beings strike him as being sostupid that they might as well be dead; consequently, he has none of the‘respect for human life’ that most religions enjoin. His credo is a doctrine ofself-expression, and if self-expression means war and murder, he unhesitatinglyprefers it to the doctrine of peace and goodwill towards men. By conventionalstandards, he is a dangerous and anti-social man who should be quietlyexterminated for the good of society. This ‘gospel of hell’ is clearly expressedin William Blake’s Marriage of Heaven and Hell, in such sayings as ‘Drive yourcart and your plow over the bones of the dead’; ‘He who desires but acts not,breeds pestilence’; ‘Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacteddesires.’ Or, in a slightly different aspect, it can be seen in a parable likethis, from Nietzsche’s Gay Science:> A man holding a newly born child in his hands came to a saint. ‘What should I> do with the child?’ he asked. ‘It is wretched, deformed, and has not even> enough of life to die.’ ‘Kill it,’ cried the saint with a dreadful voice.> ‘Kill it, and then hold it in thy arms for three days and three nights to> brand it on thy memory: thus wilt thou never again beget a child when it is> not the time for thee to beget.’ When the man had heard this, he went away> disappointed, and many found fault with the saint because he had advised> cruelty ... ‘But is it not more cruel to let it live?’ asked the saint.5At first sight, in fact, it looks as if the Outsider’s pessimistic vision leadsdirect to cruelty and anti-Christianity. Yet there is another aspect to this‘Outsider vision’ of the universe: a profound awareness of misery and pain thatis the very reverse of the ruthless concentration-camp mentality. It can be seenin Dostoevsky all the time, from Poor Folk to The Brothers Karamazov. On a firstreading of Blake’s Prophetic Books—especially the finest and most lyrical ofthem, The Four Zoas—the main impression the reader gets is of an enormous numberof descriptions of misery and torment: passages like this are a commonplace:> The Spectre wept at his dire labours when from Ladles huge> > He pour’d the molten iron round the limbs of Enitharmon.6His personages are continually ‘howling and wailing,’ or ‘writhing in torment’;the Prophetic Books are full of visions of winds shrieking through space, andred flames and smoke. Now it is evident that the motive underlying Blake’semphasis on pain is not sadism, but an Outsider’s attempt to underline theconcept of hell. He is simply striving for an intensification of consciousnessthrough pain—the reaction of an Outsider in rebellion against thesecond-rateness of his time. For a full understanding of the Prophetic Books,they should be turned to immediately after reading Blake’s Island in the Moon,the fragment of a satirical novel about the fashionable drawing-rooms of hisday, with silly society women gushing, and detestable ‘intellectual’ men tryingto be brilliant. One can see why an Outsider should turn with relief to the ideaof pain; it represents an approach to reality.The Outsider finds the concept of hell valuable, then, because pain is anantidote for human stupidity; it has the power of heightening consciousness, andthe Outsider’s deepest realisation is that his consciousness needs heightening.At the same time, the idea of ruthlessness is a relief when one has beenoverwhelmed by mediocrity.The prevalence of the idea of strain and suffering in modern art is undoubtedlydue to this basic Outsider consciousness: there is the gloomy atmosphere in thenovels of Faulkner and Sartre, and the tension in the music of a composer likeAlban Berg,* or in much of the painting of such men as Picasso, Ernst andBraque. But more than this, all Outsider art and literature has a sort of biastowards insanity. Blake says, in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: ‘As I waswalking among the fires of hell, delighted with the enjoyments of Genius, whichto Angels look like torment and insanity ... ’ This tendency could easily belabelled ‘decadence,’ but the label is meaningless. The truth is that theBarbusse Outsider (it will be recollected that Barbusse’s hero spent his dayslooking through a hole in the wall at the life that comes and goes in the nextroom), the ‘early-stage’ Outsider, finds hell easier to comprehend than heaven.He finds insanity easier to comprehend than the supersanity of men ofgenius—which is the only sanity that ultimately he wants to understand. For him,the ‘sanity’ of the bourgeois is not true sanity, any more than the stagnationof a swamp is true calm and serenity. But he knows no other kind.The concept of hell is only important in so far as it points to a concept ofheaven. The concept of insanity only matters because it is a step towardssupersanity.The second part of this book will be mainly concerned with defining thesenotions of ‘heaven’ and ‘supersanity.’ But before then, there are some importantissues to be made clear. And the first of these is the question of the realmeaning of Existenzphilosophie—the meaning that the Outsider attaches to it. Andagain, we must refer to this basic notion that all men have bungled their lives:Elijah’s ‘Take away my life, O Lord, for I am not better than my fathers.’ TheOutsider cannot help feeling that men do not learn from experience—not thereally important things. When adulthood is reached, most men seem to reach alevel of maturity at which they remain until their faculties begin to decay.There are, of course, some men who seem to squeeze the subtle essence from theirexperience and learn by it: the great poets and artists. The last quartets ofBeethoven represent the accumulated experience of fifty years, and there seemsto be no reason why he should not have gone on indefinitely—writing stillgreater music as he got older. But Beethoven is a rarity; he is more than ararity, he is almost unique. How many other artists can be said to have gone ondeveloping to the day of their death? Yet this is the essence of ‘existencephilosophy.’ Philosophy means systematising one’s knowledge of the universe;existence philosophy means systematising one’s knowledge of how to live by themost rigorous standards—by the Outsider’s standards. Very few men can serve asexamples of this kind of development. It requires a peculiar sort of honesty.Among modern writers, W. B. Yeats, Andre Gide, Rainer Maria Rilke, possessedthis honesty; Rilke especially deserves closer attention as the epitome of theexistentialist poet.Rilke’s life is especially interesting because he was, in many senses, afailure. Yeats and Gide were both reasonably fulfilled men; but Rilke seemednever to find his feet. He was lonely and dissatisfied to the end.The first sensation one is likely to have on reading Rilke is that he was fartoo sensitive; there was none of that tough-mindedness about him that one findsin Eliot or Hemingway. He is the sort of person that W. S. Gilbert might havesatirised. What is one to feel about a description like this? :> ... Through the crowd on the Graben [Prague’s main street] a young man slowly> makes his way, clad in an old-fashioned black frock coat, wearing a black> cravat round his outmoded collar and a broad-brimmed black hat. This strange> apparition holds a brightly coloured flower in his hand, a long-stemmed iris.> He bears it along solemnly, as though he were carrying a blessed candle in a> procession ... He seems to be looking for somebody that nobody has yet seen in> these streets ... A group of quite young people have collected at a street> corner and gaze ecstatically at the man with the flower. ‘That was Rainer> Maria Rilke,’ one of them whispers ... and all smile happily.7This is an account of Rilke at twenty, by Steiner-Prag, a contemporary observer.In the same way, when one reads Rilke’s letters—so many of them passionateeffusions to older women—one cannot help feeling that he was a mother’s boy, andnever grew out of it. When one learns that his mother brought him up as a girl,dressing him completely in girl’s clothes until he went to school, and even thenplaying games with him in which he would be ‘little Sophie’ (her ‘sweet littledaughter’) one can only recoil, and turn hastily to Hemingway’s stories of hisearly childhood in the Michigan backwoods.But in spite of this, Rilke has a kind of toughness that is quite peculiar tohim: a Baudelaire-like capacity to accept his own pain and transmute it; tohammer it into creation.Rilke’s father was a civil servant with some appointment on the railways, anAustrian whose family had strong military traditions, and whose own militarycareer had been frustrated by ill health. He wanted his son to become an officerin the Austrian Army. So at the age of eleven Rainer was torn from his mother’spetticoats and sent to the military school at St. Polten. Until then, he hadhardly mixed with other children; he had even been accompanied to and fromschool by a nurse. In the rough and noisy environment of the military academy hewas thoroughly miserable, and may possibly have made himself more miserable byindulging in self-pity. He spent five years there; later he described himself asleaving it ‘in a state of exhaustion, misused in body and mind,’ and even wentso far as to compare the academy with the prison camp of Dostoevsky’s House ofthe Dead! It is, in any case, impossible to say whether the sudden harshness ofhis cadet experience did him more harm than good. Finally, at sixteen, hemanaged to get himself removed from the academy on grounds of weak health—orpossibly the legend that he ‘ran away’ may have some substance. He studied inthe commercial academy at Linz for a short time, and seems to have been a goodpupil, and then, at the suggestion of an uncle, began to study law, with a viewto succeeding the uncle in his barrister’s practice. Probably Rilke accepted hisuncle’s offer to finance his education simply as an escape from the need to earnhis own living. He seems to have been happier at Prague University than he hadbeen in the academy: it gave him the leisure he wanted in order to write. For bythis time, he had decided that he wanted to be a poet. He had always scribbledand sketched, ever since he was a child, and his parents had encouraged him inhis early years. Now, at the age of seventeen, he began writing a great deal ofbad verse, and fell in love several times. To one lady, he wrote no less than ahundred and thirty letters, which she later sold to the Prussian archive. (Rilkewas always a prodigious letter writer; his collected letters occupy manyvolumes, and each letter is as carefully written as a poem.)The remarkable thing about the young Rilke is not the excellence of his poetry;if he had died at the age of twenty-five, no one would have remembered him. Itis the fact that he so thoroughly dramatised himself in the role of poet. Thelife of Rilke is an astounding case of self-creation. He has in common with hisgreat contemporary Sibelius the fact that his early work showed no specialtalent; and it would have taken a person of extraordinary insight to distinguishyoung Rilke from the other young poets and writers he mixed with in Prague. Hisfirst volume of poems appeared when he was nineteen. It was published at his ownexpense; so was a curious little magazine called Wild Chicory, which hepresented to hospitals and societies. There is a touching Shelleyan idealismabout this last idea: writing ‘songs for the people,’ and giving them away free!He published more volumes of poetry in the next few years—an average of a volumea year. When he was twenty-two, he discovered the work of the Danish novelist J.P. Jacobsen, and was particularly influenced by Niels Lyhne, which is a sort ofnineteenth-century version of Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.Rilke hardly needed confirming in his vision of himself as a poet; butJacobsen’s novel provided him with a warning, too. Niels’s mother is a MadameBovary figure, who has always lived in a land of dreams, and found reality toohard and coarse for her. She brings up her son with the idea of making a poet ofhim (we can see why Rilke was so struck by the book). Niels has the temperamentof a poet, but not the strength for loneliness—that strength that makes the workof the deaf Beethoven so great. He keeps turning to people and to shallow idealsto relieve the tension. Finally, he becomes something of a drifter—adissatisfied wanderer, like Shelley’s Alastor—and joins the army in a warbecause he needs some external support for his own existence. When he is shot,and dies, the reader feels that it is not a moment too soon. He was weak.Rilke took the lesson to heart; Niels Lyhne became his bible.The uncle who had paid for Rilke’s education in law died when Rilke wasseventeen. He stayed in Prague for another three years, then moved to Munich,and announced to his disapproving father that he intended to follow a literarycareer. The allowance of his uncle was still continued. One suspects that hewent to study in Munich because he wanted to get away from his family. At allevents, he found himself a small room, and spent a great deal of his time incafés, talking philosophy. He had discovered the work of Nietzsche at about thistime, and it is evident that Nietzsche made an immense impact on him. He adoptedthe idea of the superman—the need to become greater than man—and even wentfurther than Nietzsche in concocting a ‘gospel of hate,’ which he embodies in ashort story The Apostle. In this story, a taciturn stranger excites thecuriosity of the guests at a watering place; one day he is drawn out by a ladywho asks him to contribute to a charity, and politely explains that he dislikeslove and prefers hate. He then expounds the idea that the strong should build anew empire on the corpses of the weak and the unfit. It is evident that Rilkewas in revolt against the feminine side of his nature, which his mother hadhelped to develop.His three years in Munich seem to have been spent mostly in talking and meetingpeople. He met there Lou Salome, the girl who had refused Nietzsche’s proposalof marriage fifteen years before. (Nietzsche was still alive in 1897, butinsane.) Lou was in her midthirties, and Rilke seems to have made amother-figure of her, and written her (as usual) an immense number of long,confiding letters. She was now a happily married woman. In 1899, when Rilke wastwenty-four, he went to Russia with Lou and her husband. This trip marks aturning point in his career. On his return, he spent several months studyingRussian; he and Lou were the guests of a friend at Bieberstein. After thisvisit, Rilke dashed off in less than a month the twenty-six poems that make uphis first really important volume of verse, The Book of Hours. Then, withoutpausing, he went on to write The Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke—thefirst poem that was to bring him fame in German-speaking countries—and severalshort stories, including the haunting and grisly ‘Annuschka,’ about ahalf-imbecile country girl who is seduced, kills her baby, and then tries tocompensate for its loss by buying a puppet theatre. There followed a second tripto Russia, longer than the first, on which he met Tolstoy. Relations betweenhimself and Lou became rather strained on this trip, when she left him strandedin St. Petersburg. It is not certain whether Rilke had ever been Lou’s lover;but certainly, after the second trip to Russia, he threw off her domination. Heaccepted the invitation of a friend to the village of Worpswede, where anartists’ colony had been established, attracted, perhaps, by the austere beautyof the moors. There he became friendly with a group of young girls who weretraining themselves in painting and sculpture. One of them was Clara Westhoff,who not long afterwards became his wife. The young couple rented a farmhouse onthe moors, and Rilke became a father. Finances were not easy. Until then, he hadbeen receiving a small allowance from his father, but now his father wrote tosay he could no longer afford it, and suggested that Rilke should come and takea job in a bank. The idea horrified him; he began to write frantically to allhis friends, asking if they could suggest any literary work. Finally, someonecommissioned him to do a series of monographs on the Worpswede artists, and thehorror of working for a living was temporarily staved off. But life in thefarmhouse was not easy. The baby screamed, and Rilke tried to write.Finally—probably to his immense relief—his wife went off to stay with friends inHolland, and he was invited to be the guest of a prince in a castle in Holstein.Rilke was never thereafter to settle down for a long period with his wife. Itwas an experiment, which had not worked particularly well, but his wife was ofan independent temperament, and there was no quarrel.In 1902, a year after his marriage, Rilke was commissioned to write a monographon Rodin; he wrote, announcing his arrival, and then went to see the oldsculptor in Paris. He detested the city; its misery and poverty appalled him. Hewrote to Lou Salome of ‘a great terrifying astonishment,’ and the ‘horror at theprospect of all that, by some unspeakable confusion, is called life.’ He sawParis as a Waste Land, with ‘hosts of invalids, armies of dying, nations ofdead.’ The book that grew out of these experiences, Malte Laurids Brigge, is oneof the gloomiest books ever written. Like Niels Lyhne, it is the story of ayoung poet who is just not strong enough. It is written in the form of ajournal, and interspersed with fictionalised bits of autobiography. Itsatmosphere of misery and desperation is equalled by very little in modernliterature.On the other hand, Rodin was as salutary an experience as Russia had been. Thepowerful old man—he was then sixty-two—was a living example of the virtues ofsanity and hard work. Russia had given Rilke’s work a strong element of mysticalreligion; Rodin brought it back to earth and made its outlines sharp and clean.In 1905, Rilke acted for a time as his secretary, but the job bored him, and didnot give him enough time for his own work. Finally, relations between thembecame strained, and they separated—although a friendship persisted. Rodinprobably thought of Rilke as weak and oversensitive.During the next eight years Rilke travelled around Europe, spending a great dealof his time as the guest of various members of the nobility. (There was anelement of snobbishness in Rilke; he liked to believe that he was descended fromPolish nobility, although his ancestors were actually German peasants.) Hefinished Malte very slowly, and it was finally published in 1910. More volumesof poetry were published. Cornet Christopher Rilke had established his Europeanreputation in 1906 (some years after it was written); the Stundenbuch, the Buckder Bilder (Book of Images) and New Poems contained poetry that would addRilke’s name to the list of great European poets. The most important friendshipof these years was with Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis-Hohenlohe. They metin 1909, shortly after he had finished Malte. She was twenty years older thanRilke; immediately, he cast her for the role of mother-figure, and she found itdelightful. For the remaining years of his life, she supplied him generouslywith the sympathy he needed—and also with moral and financial support. In 1912,staying at the home of the princess, he began the first of his Duino Elegies,his masterpiece.The war came, and Rilke was called up for military service. Three weeks ofbarrack life was enough to give him a breakdown, and he was given a clerical jobin the War Office. In 1916, a petition signed by numerous German writers securedhis discharge, and he returned to Munich. But the experience had shattered him;it was too much like the military academy of his early years, and the senselesshorror of the war robbed him of creative ability. As soon as the war was over,he escaped to Switzerland, where he stayed as a guest with various friends.Slowly, he began to recuperate. His publisher was supplying him with anallowance (as he had been for the past twelve years or so). Rilke moved to Parisfor a while, then into a castle that had been lent him for six months, andfinally, to the Château de Muzot, in the Rhone Valley. There, in a sudden burstof power, he finished the ten Duino Elegies, and produced the Sonnets toOrpheus, generally acknowledged to be his other masterpiece.It was as if the tremendous effort had exhausted him. For the remaining fiveyears of his life, he wrote very little: a few poems in French, a fewtranslations. His health was broken, and he died in December, 1926.From this brief account of Rilke’s life, one might well ask: In what sense washe an Outsider? There were certainly no strange, catastrophic events, as in thelives of Nietzsche, Van Gogh, T. E. Lawrence. If one wished to be unkind, onecould say that he solved the problem of making a living by bringing the art of‘guesting’ to perfection, and seems to have spent his life staying in castlesand châteaux borrowed from aristocratic friends. Yet a closer examination willshow that, in a far deeper sense, he was even more of an Outsider than Nietzscheor the others. For the simplest way to define an ‘Outsider’ would be to say thathe is a man for whom the world as most men see it is a lie and a deception.Blake, in this sense, is the supreme Outsider. The fact that men need oneanother, that they live in close contact, means that they all impose their wayof seeing on one another. This means that while a man is a member of society, itis impossible for him to achieve any vision of the world radically differentfrom that of his fellow men. But Blake, with the piercing insight of avisionary, wrote:> How do you know but ev’ry Bird that cuts the airy way,> > Is an immense world of delight, clos’d by your senses five?8and penetrated to the deepest root of the Outsider problem as only a man ofgenius can. No man can become a superman in a world of apes; it is impossible tobe great among pygmies. And yet this is the problem that drives the Outsider. Ina passage in Make, which I have already quoted in The Outsider, Rilke asked:> Is it possible ... that nothing real or important has yet been seen or known> or said? ...> > Yes, it is possible.9In this long question-and-answer passage, Malte asks himself many questions: ‘Isit possible that, despite our discoveries and progress ... we still remain onthe surface of life? Is it possible that the whole history of the world has beenmisunderstood?’ And to each question, he answers himself: Yes, it is possible.Complete isolation—that is what the Outsider is driving at. He knows that, if hecould only achieve it, there is a completely different way of seeing the world—away so different that one might almost say that it would no longer be the sameworld. The Outsider’s final problem is to become a visionary. The first and mostobvious step is to cut himself off from other people, so as not to beconditioned by their way of seeing. Malte’s catechism is the very essence ofthis attitude.Rilke might almost be said to have made himself a poet by an act of will. As Ihave already mentioned, his early poetry shows very little talent; unlike aRimbaud, a Hugo von Hofmannsthal, he did not create a great poetry at sixteen.He envisaged his ideal of the poet, and then quite deliberately acted the poetuntil he became one. He widened his receptive powers; and when the greatexperience of Russia came, he was ready for it. The broad rivers, the forests,the vast cathedrals and churches, the general feeling of a people untouched byWestern materialism, produced a sudden heightening of his sensibilities, anecstatic receptiveness. After the Russian experience, his work became ‘saturatedwith religion.’ The first two parts of the Stundenbuch (Book of Hours) arecalled ‘The Book of Monastic Life’ and ‘The Book of Pilgrimage’; they are themeditations of a Russian monk on ‘God, nature and human life.’ J. B. Leishmanhas said that everything Rilke saw or felt in Russia was a revelation of God. Itis quite clear that for the young poet, for whom the world up till then had beena gloomy, hostile, difficult place, Russia seemed like a spiritual Utopia. Nodoubt the Russia of 1900 was not quite the Russia that Rilke wanted to imagine;what matters is that the image of ‘holy Russia’ changed him from a mere poet toa visionary, and in doing so, made him into a far greater poet.The next major experience—apart from the idyll with the jeunes filles en fleursin Worpswede, and his marriage—was the other side of the penny: Paris, city ofgloom, ‘where ghosts in daylight clutch at passers-by.’ After the spiritualrelease, back to the cage; the wheel turns again; the original vision reappears.The last book of the Stundenbuch is called ‘The Book of Poverty and Death.’ Andthe opening sentence of Make is: ‘People come here, then, to live? I shouldrather have thought they came here to die.’ Make contains all that Rilke hadlearned in two decades about becoming a poet. It contains his denunciation offame; the notoriety which can turn an Outsider into an Insider, and his warningagainst it:> ... fame, that public destruction of one in process of becoming, into whose> building ground the mob breaks, displacing his stones.> > Young man anywhere, in whom something stirs that makes you tremble, profit by> the fact that no one knows you! And if they contradict you ... if they would> destroy you ... what is this obvious danger, which holds you concentrated> within yourself, compared to the later, subtle enmity of fame which leaves you> harmless by scattering your forces?10Malte is a great book because it is such an extraordinary evocation of a man onhis own in a foreign city: the conflict between his certainty of his own poweras an Outsider, and his feeling of being negated by the immense number of peoplewho live their lives as if he did not exist. There are moments in it when Malteseems to achieve the power of insight that reconciled Hesse’s Step-penwolf tohis unfulfilment; the moment, for instance, when he passes the shop with the twomasks hung outside the door: one of the drowned girl who was taken from theSeine, and smiles with such tranquillity; the other of Beethoven, symbol of thewill to conquer:> That hard knot of senses drawn tense; that unrelenting concentration of a> music continually seeking to escape; the countenance of one whose ear a god> had closed that he might hear no tones but his own, so that he might not be> led astray by what is transient ...> > ... who will now withhold you from lustful ears? Who will drive them from the> concert halls, the venal company with sterile ears ... ?11If Malte is a less perfect book than Niels Lyhne, it is because Rilke lacked thestaying power and detachment to shape the book as a novel. (After all, inJoyce’s Portrait—Malte’s closest relative—only the last few pages are in journalform, and these are the weakest of the book.) Yet because it is not a novel,there is a power of concentrated thought about it that makes it as unique asSartre’s La Nausée.The fatigue and disillusionment that are visible in Malte were the next stageson the path from poet to visionary. Until then, the histrionic aspect of being apoet had kept Rilke too self-conscious to abandon himself to new stages ofmaturity. (As in earlier days he had carried flowers through the street, so nowhe wore black silk waistcoats, and douched himself in eau de Cologne.) Now hewas universally recognised as a poet, but he had not much time to spare forbasking in his fame; it would have meant ceasing to develop.The first of the Duino Elegies came two years after he had finished Make. Thestory of how the great first line was ‘given’ to him is well known. He was alonein Princess Marie’s Castle Duino, near Trieste. One windy morning he received abusiness letter that worried him. With the oversensitivity of a poet, he allowedthe problem to plunge him into an irritated despair, and went walking out alongthe battlements of the castle, with the sea roaring below. Suddenly, the linesseemed to come to him out of the sky:> Who, if I cried, would respond in the Order of Angels?*It was the despair of a poet who felt that there must be some order of beingmore like himself than the apes who called themselves human beings. This ‘higherorder’ of beings he called ‘Angels,’ although he might as well have called themSupermen (as Shaw or Nietzsche would) or gods (as the ancients would). He wrotethe line down immediately in his notebook; hurriedly sent off the letter thatworried him, and then completed the First Elegy. The second was written almostimmediately, and the others sketched out in the same burst of creative power.The last Elegy was not to be completed until ten years later.Since the Elegies might well be called the greatest set of poems of moderntimes, it would not be fair to try to give an impression of them here. They havehad as much influence in German-speaking countries as The Waste Land has inEngland and America; although it would perhaps be more accurate to compare themto Eliot’s Four Quartets. Their central theme is that of the angel: Rilke’scertainty of the need for a higher order of existence. (It is significant thatthe Elegies were finally published at about the same time as Back toMethuselah.) Certain lines have a power that comes over even in translation:> For Beauty’s nothing> > but beginning of Terror we’re still just able to bear.13The idea that dominates the Elegies is the concept of human suffering, and theconcept of a vision that makes human suffering seem unimportant. Yeats touchedupon this many times in his later poetry:> That some stream of lightning> > From the old man in the skies> > Can burn out that suffering> > No right-taught man denies ... 14But most important is the fact that Rilke’s ‘religion’ in the Elegies is theNietzschean religion. In a letter to the Polish translator of the Elegies, hemakes this clear:> Not, however, [religion] in the Christian sense (from which I more and more> passionately withdraw), but in a purely mundane, deeply mundane, blissfully> mundane consciousness ... 15In fact, the affirmation of Nietzsche’s vision on the hilltop, of Van Gogh’sStarry Night, of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. There is also an element of theGoethean mysticism of the last words of Faust:> All things corruptible> > Are only reflection.> > Earth’s insufficiency> > Here reaches perfection ... 16In the Ninth Elegy, this mysticism of the earth appears in the question:> ... Are we, perhaps, here just for the saying: House, Bridge, Fountain, Gate,> Jug ... ?17And in:> Earth, isn’t this what you want: an invisible> > re-arising in us? Is it not your dream> > to be one day invisible? Earth! Invisible!> > What is your urgent command, if not transformation?> > Erde, du Hebe, ich will ... 18The last phrase must be left in German: the English ‘Earth, thou loved one, Iwill!’ hardly expresses its ecstasy of affirmation.The opening lines of the Tenth Elegy are perhaps the greatest in all theElegies:> Some day, emerging at last from this terrifying vision may I burst into> jubilant praise to assenting Angels!> > May not even one of the clear-struck keys of the heart fail to respond through> alighting on slack or doubtful or rending strings! May a new-found splendour> appear in my streaming face! May inconspicuous Weeping flower! How dear will> you be to me then, you Nights of Affliction! Oh, why did I not, inconsolable> sisters, more bendingly kneel to receive you, more loosely surrender myself to> your loosened hair? We wasters of sorrows!> > How we stare away into sad endurance beyond them, trying to foresee their end!> Whereas they are nothing else than our winter foliage, our sombre evergreen,> one of the seasons of our interior year ... 19The concept that now grips Rilke is in the idea of super-consciousness, and theactual using of his experience in a complete rebuilding of his being. Thepassage above is pure existence-philosophy in the Outsider sense, for it showsRilke reaching towards a new level of consciousness by the process ofassimilating his most difficult experiences. Behind it there lies the feelingthat men lose their experience because they turn away from it, shielding theirheads with their hands, as if to ward off a blow. ‘We wasters of sorrows’—wewasters of our own lives. This is Rilke’s own way of phrasing, and of answering,Eliot’s question:> Where is the Life we have lost in living?When closely analysed, it becomes evident that Rilke’s final philosophy is aphilosophy of the Will. All experiences can be used as the building bricks of avisionary consciousness if there is a conscious effort at assimilation. It isnot true merely of sorrows that we tend to ‘stare into sad endurance beyondthem, trying to foresee their end’; it is true of by far the greater part of ourexperience. Not being supermen, our brains are not big enough to contain all theworld at once: we have to select what is to be remembered; and we remember onlythose experiences that we allow to penetrate our indifference. Rilke’s Elegiesare a plea for an effort of will to assimilate more; a plea for lessindifference. The gloomy Fourth Elegy has the line ‘Wir sind nicht einig,’‘We’re never single-minded.’ The whole of William James’s chapter on ‘TheDivided Self’* is only a commentary on this line. Rilke felt, as Hesse did, thathuman life is spent in continual perplexity, continual boredom or misery ordoubt. The moments of supreme detachment, when we stand above our own experienceand somehow see a meaning in it, come too rarely. In those moments, we feelunified, and have a keener sense of being alive; the world no longer presses onus so that it seems to flatten us; it is withdrawn, at arm’s length. Animalsseem strangely at one with themselves; higher consciousness imposes new strains,and the men who have the greatest sensibility often wish they could get rid ofit (like Whitman wishing he was a cow, or T. E. Lawrence envying a soldiercaressing a dog). They are half afraid of it. They are afraid of insanity. Butthe strain occurs only in the halfway stage. Rilke recognised that what isneeded is an effort of affirmation. Of course there is strain for a man standingbetween two stools. He must make up his mind which one he wants to sit on. If hedecides for the lower one (as Lawrence did) he should sit on it. If he decidesfor the higher one, he should make the effort of will to achieve the new stateof consciousness, and make an attempt to bully his experience, instead ofallowing it to bully him. This may be an unpoetic way of expressing thephilosophy underlying the Elegies (and an oversimplification, of course), but itis the language that precedes action, and Rilke’s failure lies in the fact thathe never tried to bridge the gap between words and action. Perhaps he lovedwords too much; and although this is fortunate for us, it made his life atragedy.Yet there are moments in Rilke’s life of near-mystical experience. One of themhe describes in a prose piece called Experience. He had been walking in thegarden of Castle Duino, reading a book, and had leaned in the fork of a lowtree, and suddenly felt> ... completely received into nature, in an almost unconscious contemplation.> Little by little his attention awoke to a feeling he had never known: it was> as though almost imperceptible vibrations were passing into him from the> interior of the tree ... It seemed to him that he had never been filled with> more gentle motions, his body was being somehow treated like a soul ... he ...> asked himself what was happening to him then, and almost at once found an> expression that satisfied him, saying to himself, that he had got to the other> side of Nature ... 20There had also been another time, which he mentioned in a letter to PrincessMarie:> ... a morning hour, early on the second day, in the little drawing-room next> to the billiard room; no one had yet come down; I was reading a hymn of some> Poeta ignoto ... and was full of concentration and pure mental composure.> Outside was the park: everything was in tune with me; one of those hours that> are not fashioned at all, but only, as it were, held in reserve, as though> things had drawn together and left space, a space as undisturbed as the> interior of a rose ... a ... space in which one keeps quite still ... 21This second experience is not a ‘mystical’ experience in the accepted sense; itsessence is the phrase ‘full of concentration and pure mental composure.’ It isthe sort of state that Sri Ramakrishna strove to achieve by isolating himselfand composing his mind; a state which is difficult to attain in this complexmodern age. But it is the state in which mystical insight comes to birth; itwill be necessary to say a great deal more of it in dealing with Swedenborg andBoehme in later chapters. What is important to realise is that ‘mystical’experiences are not experiences of another order of reality, but insights intothis order seen with extraordinarily clear vision and greater concentration.More important than Rilke’s ‘mystical’ experiences are the conclusions that hedrew from them. The essence of his philosophy is contained in the phrase‘dennoch preisen,’ to praise in spite of. These two words contain the essence ofRilke’s greatness. He admired Baudelaire’s poem ‘Carrion’ because it facedunpleasantness and made poetry out of it: the poem is about a dead animal whichBaudelaire came across on a walk. When Rilke first used that phrase ‘to praisein spite of,’ James Joyce’s Ulysses had not been published, and Hemingway hadnot even begun to write. Yet the phrase defines the greatness of Ulysses and AFarewell to Arms. In Ulysses, the trivial and disgusting is dwelt on inconsiderable detail, so that the first half of the book usually repels readerswho come to it for the first time. Then, with the Nighttown scene, a tremendouspower begins to flow into it, and continues to rise as the Catechism chapterdevelops its God’s-eye view of Dublin; finally, as Mrs. Bloom, dreaming of herpast lovers, seems to change into the earth itself, spinning around the sun, thesupreme transformation takes place: the great act of affirmation of all life,with ‘yes I said yes I will Yes’—‘Erde, du Hebe, ich will.’Rilke, too, was capable of envisaging such an act of complete affirmation; his‘Orpheus’ of the Sonnets to Orpheus makes it all the time:> Praising, that’s it! As a praiser and presser> > he came like the ore from the taciturn mine> > Came with his heart, oh, transient presser,> > for men, of a never-exhaustible wine.> > Voice never fails him for things lacking lustre ... 22But Rilke could never make this boast of himself. Voice often failed him for‘things lacking lustre.’ Like the early Yeats, he had all his life hatedugliness and misery and turned away from it. That effeminate, Jamesian prose wasnot the instrument for taking the worst reality by the throat; and could onehonestly expect lyrical poetry to do all that Joyce did in Ulysses?No, the truth is that, great as Rilke was, he reached his deepest insights intheory rather than in practice. Towards the end he saw quite clearly that thereally great poet should be an Orpheus, living with such intensity that ‘voicenever fails him’—not for anything. But he did not put this into practicethroughout his life. In the Sonnets, he strives to be Nietzschean in his refusalto shudder and turn away. In the ninth sonnet of the second part, he tellsmerciful judges not to boast of their humanity, and of the instruments oftorture we no longer use, for men have not become greater by all this mercy andenlightenment. In the eleventh sonnet, he speaks of killing, and says that it is‘only another form of our wandering sadness.’ (At this point, his Englishtranslator breaks into indignation in his notes, and demands whether one couldmurmur that sentiment over a Nazi murder camp!) This, of course, is pureZarathustra—the man who has so far transcended his ‘human-all-too-human’limitations that nothing horrifies him. But Rilke himself never achieved suchgreatness. He wandered from castle to castle, mansion to mansion, reading thebad poetry of rich women, and engaging in ‘serious conversations’ with all kindsof imbecilic members of the nobility. In between times he was a chronichypochondriac, and something of a figure of fun in the Bunthorne manner. Inshort, after reading too many of the Letters, or one of the many biographies ofhim, one cannot help turning with relief to someone like Hemingway, who errs onthe side of being thickskinned rather than oversensitive.This is not intended as a literary criticism. The present chapter is not aboutliterature, but about existentialism. Rilke’s contribution lies in the fact thathe did, actually, learn a great deal from his own life, and reached certainconclusions which, even if he didn’t live up to them himself, are of inestimableimportance in the search of the Outsider. It is important to realise that onecannot speak of Rilke the man and Rilke the poet as if they were one and thesame. The poet was triumphant; the man was miserable. The poet seems to haveachieved a peculiar self-mastery; the man was always subject to nervousprostrations and fits of hypochondria; he wasted his vital powers in worries andirritations.Many ‘Outsiders’ might claim that this is quite inevitable—Hesse, for instance,who feels that the ‘moments of ecstasy’ are paid for by ennui and suffering; orYeats, who wrote:> The intellect of man is forced to choose> > Perfection of the life, or of the work.23But the whole conception of the Outsider is a protest against this attitude.There was not this dichotomy in Chaucer or Villon or Rabelais; they were nothaunted and miserable men because they were capable of creation. It is true thathistory may have deceived us, but they certainly give the impression of beingmen who knew how to live as well as to create. In the preface to his poems, JohnMillington Synge touches the question with finality:> Many of the older poets, such as Villon and Herrick and Burns, used the whole> of their personal life as their material, and the verse written in this way> was read by strong men, and thieves, and deacons, not by little cliques only> ...> > In these days poetry is usually a flower of evil or good; but it is the timber> of poetry that wears most surely, and there is no timber that has not strong> roots among the clay and the worms ... before verse can be human again it must> learn to be brutal.24It can be said that Synge, although he was writing twenty years before AFarewell to Arms, had anticipated the kind of existentialism that Hemingwaybrought back into literature, or that Joyce—apparently unintentionally—createdin Buck Mulligan.It is almost certainly true that the poetry of Rilke—‘the poetry ofexaltation’—is higher than that of Herrick and Villon. The sensible assumption,then, would seem to be that Villon found it easier to make his life and hispoetry commensurate because the poetry was nearer the ground, and that a poetlike Rilke would require a far greater effort to live on the level of hispoetry. This immediately disposes of that nightmare of the Barbusse Outsider,that life is bound to be a miserable failure for the sensitive man who sees ‘toodeep and too much.’ The problem that is still left open is simply the questionof how a poet like Rilke is to use the ‘wisdom’ of the poetry to direct his ownlife. It is the moral question that becomes an existentialist question only bythe depth of the attempt to answer it: What shall we do with our lives? TheOutsider’s standards are unusually high. For him, ‘success’ and ‘failure’ have acompletely new meaning. Ordinary ‘success’ seems particularly poisonous to him:the success of a film star or businessman or the author of a best seller. Thatis only a way of wading out into the world’s stupidity and losing thepossibility of vision. Yet this is no academic question, this question ofpurpose. The Outsider is only the ordinary man raised to an unusual level ofperception; his conception of purpose is more exclusive than most men’s. Hecrystallises it into a positive recognition of the need for an existencephilosophy, a science of living. A ‘science’ only means an attempt to bringorder and unity into a subject; the scientist’s method is classification andcomparison and experiment. That is the Outsider’s method, too, except that hissubject is the actual living stuff of experience, the raw material of thewriter. This is why so much of the evidence examined in The Outsider came out ofnovels and plays and journals—especially journals. The art of the Outsider isessentially a movement towards a science of living. But only a move towards it.Human beings have not yet created such a science, but they may yet do so; it maybe the peculiar achievement of Western civilisation to have brought toconsciousness the idea of an existence philosophy. Such a philosophy has nothingwhatever to do with any science that exists at present, and certainly has norelation to ‘literary criticism’ or to philosophy.*The more vital the mind, the keener its sense of failure, of repetition andfutility. A caretaker or charlady is content to sweep out an office every day,with the certainty that the job will have to be repeated within twenty-fourhours. The man of genius demands that the work into which he throws his energylasts as long as possible; the most casual conversation of a Johnson or a Goethehas a permanent value for posterity. So it is that the most simple ‘Outsider’predicament is a question of futility, of frustration of an internal purpose.Most of us are driven by material anxieties and the need to work for a living.When, through material success or good fortune, the Outsider is freed from thesecasual obstructions, he is forced to scrutinise his sense of purpose moreclosely, to calculate how to use his opportunities to the best effect. He wouldlike his life, seen in retrospect, to have the unity of a work of art, ameaning, so that he could point to it in answer to that question: Where is theLife we have lost in living? All the wisdom he gains through experience shouldbe used as a tool to shape his life, not merely noted in a poem or novel. Thereason for Rilke’s failure would seem to be a lack of will to do anything exceptwrite poetry (that is, to note down his ‘wisdom,’ and then forget it, or put itinto cold storage until the next time he came to write); there was no will toshape his life by it. It was a failure to get his purpose consciously defined.Rilke synthesised his experience for the purpose of art, not for the purpose ofwider and deeper experience.It may be interesting, in this connection, to examine a poet whose vision was asprofound as Rilke’s, but whose conception of living was far more positive:Arthur Rimbaud.Rimbaud was born in Charleville, in the north of France, in 1854—only two yearsbefore Shaw. His father and mother separated when he was six. Madame Rimbaud, ahard-headed and determined woman, was left to bring up a family of four childrenon a minute income. She moved into one of the cheaper streets of the town, andkept aloof from her neighbours (she seems to have had something in common withD. H. Lawrence’s mother, as described in Sons and Lovers). It would also seemthat she was given to talking about religion and the conduct of life; her sonirreverently nicknamed her bouche d’ombre.But on the whole, Arthur was a well-behaved little boy; a good pupil at school,and obedient (except when he played with the scruffy boys in the street, whomhis mother disliked). A photograph of him at the age of eleven shows aremarkably pretty, serious-faced boy with wide eyes and round cheeks. He readavidly and widely, and his schoolmasters predicted that he would be a prodigy;on one occasion, he produced a digest of ancient history, including Egypt, Syriaand Babylon.* When he was fifteen, a young master named Izambard came toRimbaud’s school; he was only five years Rimbaud’s senior, and immediately madefriends with the star pupil, lending him volumes of contemporary French poetry.And in his fifteenth year, Rimbaud began to write poetry—poetry which, forprecocious mastery, can only be compared to the early music of Mozart. Izambardwas the cause of this sudden creative activity, for when he lent Rimbaud volumesof Hugo, Rimbaud wrote poetry that echoed Hugo; when it was Banville orVerlaine, he echoed Banville or Verlaine. Even so, these early poems show adelicacy of ear, and an odd quality of self-examination; at fifteen, he wrote apoem that began:> At seventeen one isn’t serious.> > A lovely night; beer-harvest, lemonade;> > The lighted cafés, dazzling, sumptuous;> > Strolls under lime-trees on the promenade ...and containing the lovely line:> on your lips a kiss> > Throbs pulsing, like a little animal.25In the year he wrote his poem, he left school in a flurry of congratulations andprizes. Izambard went home for the summer holidays; Rimbaud was sad to see himgo. And then, quite suddenly, the good pupil and obedient son started on a newcourse of conduct. Perhaps it was the unrest of the war that affected him; thePrussians were advancing on Charleville, and his elder brother had run away andjoined the army. He ran away from home and went to Paris. He was arrested as hecame off the train for having no money (or that was the version he gave, in aletter to Izambard).Izambard sent money, and a letter asking the prison governor to send Rimbaud toCharleville, or if that was impossible on account of the Prussians, to Douai.Douai is about a hundred miles northwest of Charleville, and it was there thatRimbaud eventually turned up, delighted to see his schoolmaster again, andrather pleased with himself for his escapade. Madame Rimbaud was informed thather son was safe; she immediately wrote demanding that he be sent home, andending her letter piously: ‘May God not punish his wilfulness as it deserves.’The war made communication difficult, and when Rimbaud eventually reached home,three weeks later, Madame Rimbaud seized him by the ear and threw him in throughthe door, and then turned furiously upon Izambard. He was glad to hurry off backtowards the railway station. However, a few days later he received a franticletter from Madame Rimbaud telling him that Arthur had disappeared again, andbegging his help. After his last encounter with her, Izambard was notenthusiastic, but he swallowed his annoyance, and set out to look for his pupil.The trail took him to Brussels, and then stopped. Defeated, Izambard went backto Douai—and found Arthur sitting in the parlour, copying out his poems. Thefortnight of wandering had been, on the whole, thoroughly enjoyable. His poem‘Ma Bohème’ tells the story; it begins:> Fists probing my torn pockets, off I’d wander,> > My overcoat more holes than cloth and I> > Poetry’s bondslave under the open sky ... 26But he couldn’t stay with Izambard; this time, he was handed over to the police,who took him home. Izambard was not risking another abusive reception fromMadame Rimbaud! At home again, Rimbaud wrote: ‘ ... I am dying and melting awayin the dullness, the drabness and the foulness around me ... ’There was no school for the time being. Rimbaud spent his days reading booksborrowed from the town library, writing, bored and unhappy. The Prussiansoccupied Charleville. The winter dragged by, and in February of the followingyear, school started again. But Rimbaud was determined not to return. Since hehad left school the previous August, he had grown up a great deal. His motherfound him unmanageable. His mind had suddenly matured. In Paris there werestirrings of revolution, and Rimbaud was impatient to enter the adult world andbe done with the schoolboy’s forever. Once again, he ran away to Paris. Thistime, he had a far less pleasant experience than before. He wandered aroundParis for a fortnight without money, sleeping under bridges, eating out ofdustbins. He seems to have spent a night in the army barracks, with humiliatingresults; it is not certain what happened, but the poem that was the outcome ofthe adventure makes it clear that he underwent some unpleasant sexual experienceat the hands of the soldiers. Le Coeur volé is an extraordinary poem, almostuntranslatable, but too good not to quote, at least in part:> Mon triste coeur bave à la poupe,> > Mon coeur couvert de caporal:> > Ilsy lancent des jets de soupe,> > Mon triste coeur bave à la poupe:> > Sous les quolibets de la troupe> > Qui pousse un rire général,> > Mon triste coeur bave à la poupe,> > Mon coeur couvert de caporal!> > > > > Ithyphalliques et pioupiesques,> > Leurs quolibets l’ont dépravé!> > Au gouvernail on voit des fresques> > Ithyphalliques et pioupiesques ... *This poem was the cause of Rimbaud’s break with Izambard. He sent it to hisformer master with a letter that indicated how important he felt it to be.Izambard was not equal to the occasion; he did not realise what new worlds hispupil had become acquainted with since they had last met. He wrote a satire onthe poem, and sent it to Rimbaud with the comment: ‘You see, anyone can writenonsense.’ It is hardly surprising that, from that time forward, Rimbaud offeredhim no more confidences. Nothing is more disconcerting to genius than to finditself outgrowing its elders in insight and intuition. But there is someexhilaration in the process; the contempt is a stimulus, the stupidity asteppingstone.Once more Rimbaud was back in Charleville, and this time his mother did notseize him by the ear. It was less than six months since his last escapade, butin that time he had become uncontrollable. The things he had seen and felt hadmade him prematurely wise. He knew violence and death:> In a green hollow where a river sings,> > Circling the grasses with specks of silver-white,> > From his proud steeps the sun ascendant flings> > Splendour. The valley scintillates with light.> > Open-mouthed, capless, a young soldier lies> > Where the fresh blue cresses cool his bare head;> > Pale in the light raining down from the skies> > He sleeps, stretched at length on his green mossy bed.> > His feet bruise the iris where he takes his nap> > Smiling like a sick child on its mother’s lap;> > He is cold. Earth, warm him! Cradle him to rest!> > He heeds not the scents that rise about his head;> > In the sun he dozes, head on quiet breast.> > In his right side two bullet holes have bled.28And now Rimbaud began to live in a manner deliberately conceived to shockCharleville. He refused to cut his hair or wash; he wandered around the town,smoking a dirty pipe with the bowl upside down; he lounged around in cafés,paying for drinks with lewd stories, or blasphemous comments on the Church andreligion. He embarrassed the masters at his school by sitting on the wall wherehis former classmates could see him; all were shocked by the change that hadcome over the angelic-faced, well-behaved prize winner of the previous year. Hestill spent a great deal of time reading; now it was mostly books on black magicand Satanism, or the poetry of Baudelaire and Verlaine. He was in violentreaction against the years when he had been well-behaved and well-spoken, andbesides, he was sexually frustrated and bored. He wanted an affair—that is tosay, he simply wanted a woman; but the very intensity of the desire helped tofrustrate it; his attempts to get on to close terms with the girls ofCharleville usually ended in failure and periods of self-hatred. He was too fullof lust and unsatisfied longing to make an irresistible, casual Casanova. Thedays were past when he could write of women with the gaiety of a Keats—as he hadonly a few months earlier:> Eight days I tramped, wearing my boots in holes> > On flinty roads. I came to Charleroi where> > At the Cabaret-Vert, I ordered buttered rolls> > And fresh-cooked ham not cold yet. Sitting there> > Contentedly, I stretched my legs out under> > The painted table, studying the bits> > Of simple wallpaper. Then—heavenly wonder!> > A girl with roguish eyes and bouncing tits—> > > > > Not one to shy at kisses or such matter!—> > Laughingly brought me on a coloured platter> > The bettered rolls and ham streaked white and pink,> > Ham warm and garlic-scented; from her jug> > She filled with frothing beer a noble mug.> > It caught a sparkle from the sun’s last blink.29And the idea of devil worship and blasphemy began to obsess him. He thought ofBaudelaire as a man who had submitted himself to a forcing house of sin in orderto make himself a great poet. In reaction against the small-town boredom ofCharleville, Rimbaud dreamed of a continued exacerbation of the senses throughlust, drugs, alcohol, suffering. Anything to drive away the second-rateness, thefeeling of stagnation, anything to make the blood circulate again through thoseareas of his soul that seemed to go dead in the ennui of Charleville. The ideaof becoming a drug addict, a physical wreck, a syphilitic, a dipsomaniac, didnot worry him; it seemed a good exchange for boredom.One should pause here to emphasise that it was what was now going on inRimbaud’s mind that was the major event of his life, not any mere physicalhappening. The real Rimbaud was born in those months of playing the roaring boyaround Charleville. We are back again with the concepts I outlined in theSteppenwolf passage in The Outsider. The enemy was boredom and unfulfilment. Theincentive was a feeling that there should be some way of living life to thefull, and he didn’t care what that involved. He thought he found a clue inBaudelaire—Baudelaire, the alcoholic, the drug addict, perpetually tormented,like Dostoevsky, by his own weakness and vacillation; it was in this man thatRimbaud thought he perceived a tower of satanic strength. For a while, Rimbaudbecame obsessed by the criminal, by debauchery and suffering. Like all truepoets, he was ‘of the devil’s party.’ Now, at the age of sixteen, he applied hismind to the problem of how to live life to the full. Charleville was asuneventful as a monk’s cell; it was an ideal place for the hatching of greatideas. Like Mr. Polly, Rimbaud felt that men are imprisoned in paper walls,which they could knock down if only they had the courage. Like Novalis, hebelieved that the only thing that prevents men from being geniuses is laziness.He told Izambard, in a candidly brutal letter: ‘You will end in smugself-satisfaction, having achieved nothing because you will not have wanted toachieve anything.’ Meanwhile, he continued to shock Charleville. When someonetried to shame him for wearing his hair long by offering him threepence to go tothe barber, he bowed mockingly, accepted the money, and went into the nearestshop to buy tobacco with it. In cafés, he took a delight in telling lewd storiesin a loud voice, and was triumphant if people at the next table got up and movedfurther away. He attributed awful perversions to himself, claiming to have apredilection for dogs and cats. But when he was alone, he meditated on theOutsider problem, the problem of how not to take life for granted, how touncover the hidden powers of the human spirit of which the average man is noteven aware. He formulated his doctrine that the poet must be a visionary (notrealising how close he was approaching to the thought of William Blake, who alsopaid full attention to the devil’s side of the argument). Rimbaud felt—likeBlake—that one can train oneself to see visions, ‘a drawing-room at the bottomof a lake, mosques instead of factories ... The poet makes himself a visionaryby a long, immense and reasoned derangement of all the senses.’ This could bedone by upsetting the physical and emotional constitution by deliberate exerciseof asceticism or vice. Rimbaud must have recognised that there are certain timeswhen the body is weak and fatigued—after a long illness, a hangover due toalcohol or drugs, or mere physical exhaustion—when a curious peace sweeps overthe emotions. The mind becomes quite free in an altogether new manner; insteadof being so distracted that it can hardly stick to the same thought or feelingfor more than a minute at a time, it is relaxed and easy to handle; memory workswith an amazing ease, and one’s past is evoked—its actual smell and taste—byevery chance thought or emotion. This is a sensation that every sick man, everydebauched man, every despairing man, has known at some moment.When he was seventeen, Rimbaud produced his greatest poem, ‘Le Bateau Ivre’(‘The Drunken Boat’). It is a long poem, in twenty-five four-line stanzas—astrange rhapsody, sung by a drifting ship after its crew has been murdered byRed Indians. The tense, beautiful language defies translation; something in thesubject and verbal mastery remind one inevitably of The Ancient Mariner, but nocomparison can suggest its uniqueness. For a boy who had never been near the seain his life, it is a miraculous feat of visionary imagination.It was through this poem that Rimbaud came to meet Paul Verlaine. He sent it,together with a letter, to Verlaine in Paris, and Verlaine replied with anenthusiastic letter, a railway ticket, and an invitation to come and stay withhis family.At this time, Verlaine was twenty-seven years old. He was already a well-knownpoet, having established his reputation with Saturnian Poems, published when hewas twenty-two. He was a member of an influential group of French poets whocalled themselves Parnassians, and was highly thought of, in spite of his heavydrinking and sexual irregularities. He had been a member of the civil service,but lost his position, owing to a mixture of revolutionary sympathies andordinary incompetence. He married a beautiful girl of seventeen, who came from arich bourgeois family, and in the sheer physical ecstasy of the early marriedmonths, he became an excellent husband. He was weak, sensuous, good-natured anda master of delicate and exquisite verse that possessed a ‘dying fall’—similar,in many ways, to the English poet Dowson.At the time Rimbaud arrived, Verlaine was growing restive. His wife wasexpecting a baby, and they were living with her parents. He had told his wifeand mother-in-law of the astonishing poet of Charleville (he thought Rimbaud wasabout his own age), and they both looked forward to meeting the discovery. Whena tall, gawky boy, with long, dirty hair, filthy clothes, and a red peasant’sface turned up in their drawing room, they were disconcerted. Verlaine welcomedRimbaud warmly, but Rimbaud sensed the disapproval of the others. As always whenhe felt himself disliked, he set out to be offensive, took no trouble to hidehis contempt for the bourgeois, and refused to be sociable. He went out of hisway to scandalise, and it is hardly surprising that the place soon became toohot to hold him. Then he disappeared. Verlaine had been divided betweenenthusiasm for a brother poet, and embarrassment on behalf of his relatives. Nowthat Rimbaud had disappeared, his solicitude predominated, and he soughteverywhere for the missing poet. A fortnight later, he finally bumped intoRimbaud in the street—an exhausted, sunken-cheeked Rimbaud who had been livingoff dustbins again and sleeping in doorways. With tears of pity, Verlaine boughthim a meal and found him lodgings. However, Rimbaud was incorrigible, and beforelong he was in the street again. His unsanitary habits made him unpopularwherever he stayed. (It is said that Verlaine’s wife went into the guest room tochange the pillowcases, and was horrified to find the pillows swarming withlice; when told of this, Verlaine merely commented: ‘Yes, he cultivates them tothrow at priests when he passes them in the street!’)But the famous friendship between Rimbaud and Verlaine had now begun. It is truethat the relation between them was homosexual, but it would not be true tosuppose that it was primarily on a sexual level. Rimbaud had, for the first timein his life, found a brother spirit, a poet. At last he thought he had found apartner to accompany him on his journey away from the world. It meant that hehad seen a way out of his Outsider problems: for the Outsider’s deepest sourceof discouragement is his feeling that the world is his enemy, and he must fightthe battle alone. For a while, Rimbaud laboured under the delusion that twoOutsiders, in double harness, would stand a better chance against the world.Then he began to understand that he was mistaken. His immediate reaction was totreat Verlaine rather badly—to jeer at him, to quarrel with him. On oneoccasion, in company with other poets, Rimbaud asked Verlaine to spread out hishands on the café table; when Verlaine did this, Rimbaud drew out a knife andbegan stabbing at the table between the outstretched fingers.* Verlaine jumpedup and left the café, at which Rimbaud followed him and began to slash at himwith the knife.This kind of antic reveals that Rimbaud was bored with his own attempts at vice,and was turning ‘mean.’ I cannot agree that he revealed hidden sadism; it seemsmore probable that the bursts of violence developed from an instinctive dislikeof his own silliness and lack of discipline; for fundamentally, like all greatmen, Rimbaud was a puritan.The scandal over the two men developed. Verlaine’s wife was alarmed by the badinfluence Rimbaud was exerting; one night, her husband tried to strangle her,and threw their baby against the wall. When he recovered from the hangover hesobbed with remorse, and promised to ask Rimbaud to return to Charleville. Hedid, and Rimbaud returned, cursing with rage. The few months at home were spentwriting Les Illuminations, a slim work written in a mixture of prose and verse.It is significant that Rimbaud’s finest work was written when he was away fromVerlaine. The Illuminations record the result of months of discipline of thesenses—more attempts to ‘make himself a visionary.’ The months of debauchery inParis had only made him lazy, a drifter. Alone again, he made up for it. Butsoon Verlaine sent for him. He returned to Paris, and the round of vice anddebauchery, absinthe and sodomy, began over again. Verlaine’s unfortunate wifeseems to have had a great deal to endure: Dostoevsky himself could not haveinvented a more pathetic tale. She had put up with beatings, drunken abuse, evenattacks with a knife, and finally her husband left her for good and disappearedwith his evil genius. Verlaine went to Brussels with Rimbaud, and his wifefollowed. When he met her, Verlaine was overcome with remorse; he made love toher and was reconciled; then, when she was dressed again, changed his mind. Heaccompanied her to the Belgian frontier, and hurried back to Rimbaud inBrussels. Rimbaud and he then crossed to England, and came to live in Soho. Asketch made by an artist friend at this period shows Verlaine, tall, skinny,helpless looking with his drooping moustache and spindly legs, and Rimbaud,slouching behind him, looking like a teddy boy with his long jacket, long hairsticking out from under his hat, and the foul old pipe in one hand. Theywandered all over London together, drinking away the little money that was sentto Verlaine from France, wandering around the East End and the docks, or sittingin cafés all day. Verlaine’s lovely poem ‘Il pleure dans mon coeur’ ...commemorates a brief separation from Rimbaud:> Tears fall in my heart> > Like the rain on the town> > What is this dull smart> > That pierces my heart?> > > > > O soft noise of rain> > On earth and on roofs> > For tired hearts in pain> > The patter of rain ...> > > > > But still, the worst pain> > Not to know why> > Without love or hate> > My heart has this pain.30Later they went to Brussels again, and there the disaster happened. Rimbaudthreatened to leave Verlaine, and Verlaine shot him through the wrist. Rimbaudmade no complaint, but when, a little later, he set out for the station,Verlaine produced his revolver again, and Rimbaud took refuge behind the nearestpoliceman. Verlaine was arrested; Rimbaud was taken to hospital, where he spenta week in fever. When he finally got out, he was put on trial; the medicalexamination revealed recent practice of sodomy, and a thoroughly prejudicedjudge sentenced Verlaine to two years in jail. The whole quarrel had been moreRimbaud’s fault than Verlaine’s, but it was Verlaine who paid the penalty.Meanwhile, Rimbaud went back to Charleville. He arrived exhausted, with one armin a sling, and immediately burst into tears. His mother was unexpectedlysympathetic, and even agreed to pay for the publication of the book he wanted tofinish. The book was A Season in Hell, again a mixture of prose and poetry, anexamination of his past life, his relation with Verlaine, the pride that hadurged him on to excesses. His sister records that, while he wrote it, he couldbe heard groaning and cursing in his locked room. Finally it was completed andprinted in a slim booklet. He sent copies to friends in Paris, and went to Paristo see how it was received. But the story of his exploits with Verlaine hadpreceded him; everyone thought of him as Verlaine’s evil genius. He wasuniversally snubbed. In a rage, he returned to Charleville and burnt all hispapers, all his unpublished poems, all the copies of the book he could lay hishands on. He then returned to Paris, came to London and tried to make a livingas a teacher, and finally went to Stuttgart to study German. There, Verlainejoined him again, but their second meeting was without success. Verlaine hadattempted a reconciliation with his wife; when that failed, he tried entering amonastery; when that also came to nothing, he contacted Rimbaud. As usual, therewas something about Verlaine that seemed to irritate Rimbaud—the weaknessperhaps. They staggered from café to café, drinking and smoking, and Rimbaudsoon made Verlaine blaspheme against the religion he had embraced. One eveningthey had a quarrel by the river; Rimbaud knocked Verlaine unconscious and lefthim to lie there until the following morning. Finally, Verlaine returned toParis; his road and Rimbaud’s had separated for good. Verlaine now went quietlyand gently downhill. For a while he taught in schools, then tried farming, then,with the death of his mother, simply allowed himself to drift; he drifted, onthe whole, highly successfully for the next twenty years, in and out ofhospital, always in poverty, always cheerful and gentle, until, by the time hedied in 1896, he had a European reputation, and even England had received himwith the respect due to a major poet.After A Season in Hell, Rimbaud wrote no more—at least, none of his subsequentwork has yet been discovered. If A Season in Hell is really his last work, thereis irony in the fact that the book is a recantation of his previous ‘errors,’and was intended to be a ‘new beginning.’ (It gives his poetic career a certainresemblance to that of Lautréamont—Isidore Ducasse; for Ducasse had alsoembraced a theory of Satanism, which he expressed in his long sadisticprose-poem, Les Chants de Maldoror, but recanted in the preface to an unwrittenvolume of poems which he sketched shortly before his early death.)Rimbaud lived for another sixteen years, but there would be no point in tracinghis wanderings in detail. He walked to Italy from Stuttgart, and worked as anunskilled labourer in the docks at Leghorn. He returned to Paris, and thenenlisted in the Dutch army, to be sent abroad to the Sunda Islands. He desertedand went to Sumatra, and then to Java, where he lived for a while in the forest.Finally, he worked his way back to Cyprus, where he worked as a quarry hand fora while, and then moved on again, this time to Abyssinia. He set up there as atrader in coffee and perfumes, and later gold and ivory. For a long time helived with the natives as one of them. His trading ventures were so successfulthat he was able to retire in 1888, at the age of thirty-four, and had a palaceat Harar. During the next two years, he would seem to have played some part ininternational intrigue, and been in close relation with the King of Shoa. But inMarch, 1891, a cancer developed on his knee. He hurried to Europe for anoperation, but got no further than Marseilles. There, his leg was amputated, andhe died in hospital.Meanwhile, in 1886, Verlaine had published Rimbaud’s poems. Rimbaud, inAbyssinia, did not know it, but he had become famous. The aura of mysteryattached to his name helped to make his fame; no one knew what had become ofhim, but it was assumed that he was dead. Many young writers were powerfullyinfluenced by his work (the most important of these was Paul Claudel). Themystery is by no means cleared up today; there is still some controversy aboutwhether A Season in Hell was really intended by Rimbaud to be his last work.(Miss Enid Starkie contends that it was not; if her supposition is correct, itis still possible that more works of Rimbaud may turn up out of the heart ofAfrica.)Rimbaud reminds one inevitably of T. E. Lawrence. In both cases, there are theearly, creative years, introspective, but full of will power and high-pressuredevelopment. Then the crises: for Lawrence, the desert war, for Rimbaud, theperiod with Verlaine; and after that, disillusionment and renunciation, thedeliberate choice of oblivion; finally, accidental death, as if the fates hadfinally grown impatient about their failure to be creative. Both combinedself-analysis with the mental make-up of the man of action.Well, the key to Lawrence, as we saw in The Outsider, was that he thought toomuch; he could not stop thinking; thinking robbed him of all direct sense of theworld and made him incapable of experiencing any other being but his own, aprisoner in his own rationality.The same was true of Rimbaud, except that Rimbaud made war on his rationality.His perception was Blakean. In an early poem, he had written:> Notre pâle raison nous cache l’infini.Reason for him, as for Blake, meant ‘single vision and Newton’s sleep.’ He wasfar more positive than Lawrence, more wilful. He set about dominating hisreason, with the sole aim of intensifying his intuitive experience:> I accustomed myself to simple hallucination: I really saw a mosque in place of> a factory, angels practising on drums, coaches on the roads across the sky; a> drawing-room at the bottom of a lake: monsters, mysteries.31But dominating the reason requires continual discipline—especially if one hasthe penetrating rational intelligence of a Rimbaud or a Lawrence. For a fewyears, Rimbaud was successful. Then, as practical questions began to demand hisattention, his grip loosened. He restored the grip by wallowing in sensualpractices, sex, absinthe, drugs—but it was not the same as in Charleville, whenhe had read treatises on magic. And finally, it would seem, he surrendered(although it might be as well to keep an open mind on this matter, in caseAbyssinian poems should turn up). The early vision, the early certainty,disappeared. It has been said that Rimbaud was sustained by a satanic pride, butit was not mere pride. Ancient Egyptian noblemen boasted of being related to thegods; Rimbaud, too, began to create with this certainty, refusing to accept thecommon lot of mere humanity. It would seem to be a case of hard experiencedestroying the visions. He began by thinking of himself as a god; he ended bythinking of himself as human. That was his tragedy.His achievement remains: it can be summarised in his phrase: ‘One makes oneselfa visionary ... ’ At the age of sixteen, he had seen all the way, to the end ofthe road; the final answer. But it was a goal which he was never to reach.We have glanced at two ‘visionaries,’ and tried to pinpoint their inadequacy.Unfortunately, neither of them could be called ‘twentieth-century figures,’ inthe sense that Lorca or James Joyce could be. This century has brought its ownproblems and complications; and above all, completely new conditions for the manof genius. The career of a typical twentieth-century Outsider might repay briefconsideration. On a less serious level than Rilke or Rimbaud, the life of F.Scott Fitzgerald draws attention to new aspects of the problem.Fitzgerald’s life is the tragedy of a romantic Outsider in a mechanisedcivilisation. He was born talented, and with an incurably histrionic outlook onthe world. Graceful language came to him as easily as to Oscar Wilde, and thepower of evoking an atmosphere in a few words:> One night ... I sat in a swaying motor-boat by the club-house pier, and while> the moon beat out golden scales on the water, heard young Byron Kirby propose> to Mary Cooper ... 32The word-power comes out in descriptions of school friends whom he admired:Hobey Baker, the football captain at Princeton, ‘slim and defiant’; ‘theromantic Buzz Law, whom I had last seen one cold fall twilight in 1915, kickingfrom behind his goal line with a bloody bandage around his head’; his boyhoodrival, Reuben Warner, sitting with ‘aloof exhaustion’ at the wheel of his StutzBearcat, and Fitzgerald’s description of how he himself had ‘slouchedpassionately’ over the wheel of their family car in an effort to imitate him.This is the interesting feature of Fitzgerald: the violent romanticism, straightout of Schiller or Hoffmann; the conviction that life had to offer him somethingfascinating. And it paid off. He canalised it into his first novel, This Side ofParadise, and the novel brought him fame at twenty-four; and more than fame, thedubious position of being regarded as a ‘spokesman of the younger generation.’The novel had been written under difficult circumstances; he had given up hisjob at the age of twenty-two, and retired, as he put it, ‘not on my profits, buton my liabilities, which included debts, despair and a broken engagement.’ Toescape the pain of the broken engagement, he had stayed drunk for three weeks.Then he settled down to write. The girl had turned him down because he had nomoney or prospects, he was convinced he had genius. This Side of Paradise waswritten in three months and despatched to a publisher.* Two weeks later, it wasaccepted. He was so excited that he ran along the streets, stopping cars to tellfriends that he was going to be published. He had no doubt the book would makehis name. It never occurred to him that it might be forgotten in a week, likemost modern novels. He informed his publishers airily that he would be satisfiedwith a sale of 20,000 copies—apparently unaware that he would be lucky if (as afirst novel) it sold a quarter that number. Duly, it was published, sold 40,000copies in a few months, and rocketed Fitzgerald to fame. Fitzgerald was therepresentative of a new generation and a new approach to life—at least, that waswhat the critics said. Fitzgerald says of it:> ... Petting, in its more audacious manifestations, was confined to the> wealthier classes—among other young people, the old standard prevailed until> after the war, and a kiss meant that a proposal was expected, as young> officers in strange cities sometimes discovered to their dismay. Only in 1920> did the veil finally fall—the Jazz Age was in flower.33And it so happened that Fitzgerald’s manifesto, This Side of Paradise, waspublished in 1920—the year when fashionable Europe and America went on whatFitzgerald has called ‘the greatest, gaudiest spree in history.’> A whole race going hedonistic, deciding on pleasure ... The sequel was like a> children’s party taken over by the elders ... By 1923 their elders, tired of> watching the carnival with ill-concealed envy, had discovered that young> liquor will take the place of young blood, and with a whoop the orgy began.34Fitzgerald and his newly married wife, Zelda, were right in at the head of it.Both were physically beautiful; both had grace and charm. And Fitzgerald had$18,000 to spend. They rode on top of taxis, jumped into public fountains, triedto undress in restaurants, spun around in revolving doors for half an hour,drank phenomenal quantities of whisky and champagne, and rushed from party toparty or city to city in a shower of enthusiasm and popularity like confetti.They got through the $18,000:> The cashier had not even scowled at me. I had walked in and said to him: ‘How> much money have I got?’ And he had looked in a big book and answered: ‘None.’> > That was all. There were no harsh words, no blows. And I knew there was> nothing to worry about. I was now a successful author, and when successful> authors ran out of money, all they had to do was to sign cheques. I wasn’t> poor—they couldn’t fool me.85In a burst of energy, Fitzgerald produced another novel, The Beautiful andDamned. Again, it was a considerable success. Again, Fitzgerald drew mainly onhis own experience—this time his experiences since the publication of This Sideof Paradise. It is hardly surprising that Fitzgerald later admitted to feelingnostalgic about the Jazz Age.> It bore him up, flattered him and gave him more money than he had dreamed of,> simply for telling people that he felt as they did ... 36There was an extravagance about everything Fitzgerald did. In Paris, heannounced to James Joyce that he intended jumping out of the window as a sign ofhis immense admiration for Joyce’s genius. (Ulysses had barely been published atthe time.) Joyce succeeded in restraining him, and afterwards commented mildly:‘That young man must be mad—I’m afraid he’ll do himself some injury.’ He playedextraordinary practical jokes: one day he dumped a bin full of garbage over thehedge of a garden party to which he had not been invited by a society hostess.When he was approached by an old woman carrying a tray of imitation flowers, he‘gave it a sort of gay ’nineties kick and sent everything flying,’ but wasimmediately full of remorse and desire to make amends. He and Zelda planned tosaw a waiter in two with a musical saw (‘to eliminate any sordidness’). Onanother occasion, at a farewell dinner given for the film star Grace Moore inJuan-les-Pins, Zelda jumped up, saying, ‘What are words? Nobody has offered ourdeparting heroes any gift to take with them’; she stepped out of her black lacepanties and threw them on to the table. Grace Moore’s fiancé announced that hemust perform a heroic act in return, and jumped into the sea in his dinnerjacket. When the excitement died down, they became aware of Alexander Woollcott,completely naked except for a straw hat and a cigarette, walking slowly acrossthe garden and into the hotel, where he took his key from the desk and marchedup to his room.It is this age of fantastic parties that is conveyed in the books: there is anexotic, moneyed splendour about Fitzgerald’s world. He gives the impression thatthe adults of the nineteen-twenties lived with the same exhilarated abandon asthe teenagers of This Side of Paradise. There is a curious, dreamlike air aboutit all: like the party that occupies the third chapter of The Great Gatsby:> A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting> somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady> concentration at the shelves of books ...> > ‘Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable> cardboard ... Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.’> > Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases, and returned> with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.> > ‘See!’ he cried triumphantly. ‘It’s a bona fide piece of printed matter ...> What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages> ... ’37It is a strange combination: the fairy-tale effect of the garden party in TheMan Who Was Thursday, and an underlying exhaustion and unreality, as in Camus’sL’Etranger. Gatsby is a symbol of Fitzgerald himself; his immense parties areonly an attempt to impress a girl who rejected him once, a pathetic substitutefor heroism. And Fitzgerald’s drinking was a substitute for vitality; sometimeshe was drunk for ten days at a time, and woke up in a strange town, unable toremember anything that had happened since he began drinking. There was theattempt at the heroic gesture, the Gargantuan hugeness; always, the sequel ofheadaches and hangovers, the sense of failure and the anxiety about money thatwas spent as fast as he received it from high-paying American magazines.Gertrude Stein coined the phrase ‘lost generation’ about the Jazz Age, butFitzgerald was never morally lost; only an idealist could have lived as he didin the ’twenties. It was not boredom or despair that drove him on to dipsomania,that wrecked his wife’s sanity: it was a lopsided idealism, a thirst forexperience, that was derived from Rupert Brooke and the poetry of the ’nineties.In Brooke too there had been the hunger for all experience:> It’s the sort of day that brought back to me what I’ve had so rarely for the> last two years—that tearing hunger to do and do and do things. I want to walk> 1000 miles, and write 1000 plays, and sing 1000 poems, and drink 1000 pots of> beer, and kiss 1000 girls ... The spring makes me almost ill with excitement.> I go round corners on the roads shivering and nearly crying with suspense ...> 38It is the same kind of generalised appetite for all experience that turns upagain in Thomas Wolfe in the late nineteen-twenties—Wolfe’s hero of LookHomeward, Angel who stands in the Library of Congress and yearns to read all thebooks, and know all the people who pass outside in the street. It was a poem ofBrooke’s that supplied the title of This Side of Paradise; a sensuous vision ofheaven as a South Sea island. The same lust for experience and the intangiblethat drove Brooke from England to America, to the South Seas, leaving him alwaysexhausted and disappointed, that fatigued and wrecked Thomas Wolfe in less thanten years after he had achieved literary fame with a youthful best seller, keptFitzgerald and Zelda on the move. There is a startling similarity of temperamentbetween Fitzgerald and Brooke; the letters of both are full of fooling and mockheroics:> Please don’t say you can’t come the 25th but would like to come the 29th. We> never receive people the 29th. It is the anniversary of the 2nd Council of> Nicea when our Blessed Lord, our Blessed Lord, our Blessed Lord, our Blessed> Lord—It always gets stuck in that place ... 39And Brooke, in his teens:> I am busy with an enormous romance, of which I have written five chapters. It> begins with my famous simile about the moon [‘the moon was like an enormous> yellow scab on the flesh of some leper’] but soon gets much more lewd. One of> the chief characters is a dropsical leper whose limbs and features have been> absorbed in one vast soft paunch. He looks like a great human Slug, and he> croaks infamous little songs from a ... round mouth with yellow lips. The> others are less respectable.40But there was an intellectual seriousness about Brooke, and a quality ofperception, that could have saved him from alcoholism in the face of anydisillusion. He could write in a letter to F. H. Keeling, speaking of his ownform of mysticism:> It consists in just looking at people and things as themselves—neither as> useful nor moral nor ugly nor anything else; but just as being ... I can watch> a dirty middle-aged tradesman in a railway-carriage for hours ... I know their> states of mind are bad. But I’m so much occupied with their being there at> all, that I don’t have time to think of that. I tell you that a Birmingham> gouty Tariff Reform fifth-rate business man is splendid and immortal and> desirable.41 [Italics mine.]Fitzgerald lacked this kind of perception, and as the idealism leaked away,there was nothing to put in its place. Zelda had a nervous breakdown and wentinto a mental home for a while. He produced bad stories for commercialmagazines, and drank. His finest novel, The Great Gatsby, had been highlypraised, but had not sold as he had expected, and a few years after this, thedemand for his stories from the big magazines began to lessen. Other youngwriters had arrived: Ernest Hemingway, Dos Passos, Wolfe, and later, Faulkner.There was a period of self-pity, when he tended to put the blame for his failureon his wife, and he dramatised the situation in his next novel, Tender Is theNight, in which a brilliant and promising young psychiatrist marries a beautifulrich girl who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment; he plunges into herworld of parties and summers on the Riviera, and ends as a dipsomaniac and afailure. The rich girl goes off and marries somebody else. Fitzgerald wasconvinced that the novel would re-establish him as the foremost writer of thetime; he never recovered from the blow of its complete failure. He was nowforty. He and Zelda were separated. His most serious and carefully constructednovel sold less than a quarter the number of copies of the first, carelesslydashed-off book. His nervous energy and self-confidence were badly sapped. Andsuddenly, he ran face-on into the basic experience of the Outsider—thedevastation, the crack-up. He describes it in an essay called The Crack-Up: howhe had been told by a doctor that he was tubercular, and had gone away andrested:> —And then suddenly, surprisingly, I got better.> > —And cracked like an old plate as soon as I heard the news.It was the moral exhaustion of the years of endless movement. Analysing it, herecognised:> ... that in those two years, in order to preserve something—an inner hush> maybe, maybe not—I had weaned myself from all the things I used to love—that> every act of life, from the morning tooth-brush to the friend at dinner had> become an effort. I saw that for a long time I had not liked people and> things, but only followed the rickety old pretence of liking. I saw that even> my love for those closest to me was become only an attempt to love, that my> casual relations—with an editor, a tobacco seller, the child of a friend, were> only what I remembered I should do, from other days. All in the same month I> became bitter about the sound of the radio, the advertisements in the> magazines, the screech of tracks, the dead silence in the country—contemptuous> at human softness, immediately (if secretively) quarrelsome towards> hardness—hating the night when I couldn’t sleep, and hating the day because it> went towards night. I slept on the heart side now, because I knew that the> sooner I could tire that out, even a little, the sooner would come that> blessed hour of nightmare which, like a catharsis, would enable me the better> to meet the new day.42It is to be noted that this experience is the complete reverse of Brooke’sdescription of his feelings about businessmen in a train. It is the other sideof the coin, complete apathy and dislike instead of vital insight. Fitzgeraldhas swung from the Rupert Brooke romanticism to a Chekhovian preoccupation withfailure and collapse.This, of course (although he never seemed to realise it), was what made TenderIs the Night so unpopular, and what would probably have made his last novelequally unpopular if he had ever finished it. It was full of brilliantobservation, but depressingly unconstructive. By that time, Fitzgerald had madea sort of philosophy of failure. He was able to look back on his early life, andsay of it:> ... [I believed] Life was something you dominated if you were any good. Life> yielded easily to intelligence and effort ... Life, ten years ago, was largely> a personal matter. I must hold in balance the sense of the futility of effort,> and the sense of the necessity to struggle; the conviction of the> inevitability of failure, and still the determination to ‘succeed’ ... 43This was written four years before his death. He had steadily lost control. Itwas a long way from the best-selling young writer of 1920 (when a New Yorknewspaper had run a headline: ‘Fitzgerald knocks policemen other side ofParadise’), to this tired, defeated alcoholic of 1936. His marriage had brokenup: partly because of his wife’s temperament, her need to be more than the wifeof a successful writer—to be herself successful and the centre of attention. Hisincome was less than a third of what it had been in the years of his success. Hefelt he had sold out to commercial success. He had become nervous and bitter,often quarrelsome, frequently depressed. It seemed there was nothing left of theenthusiasm and vitality of the ’twenties. Like Vaslav Nijinsky, he began to seemisery and tragedy wherever he looked:> By this time, contemporaries of mine had begun to disappear into the dark maw> of violence. A classmate killed himself and his wife on Long Island, another> tumbled ‘accidentally’ from a skyscraper in Philadelphia, another purposely> from a skyscraper in New York. One was killed in a speakeasy in Chicago;> another was beaten to death in a speakeasy in New York and crawled home to the> Princeton Club to die; still another had his skull crushed by a maniac’s axe> in an insane asylum where he was confined. These are not catastrophes that I> went out of my way to look for—these were my friends ... 44He was writing better than ever before, and he knew it. Hemingway told him in aletter about Tender Is the Night, ‘You are twice as good now as you were at thetime you thought you were so marvellous.’ Once, in exasperation at a youngwriter who praised This Side of Paradise, he said: ‘You mention that book againand I’ll slug you.’ He was still making over $10,000 a year, but after what hehad earned in the ’twenties, he felt poverty-stricken. He felt, like Axel, thatthe world is ‘an old slave who promises us the keys to a palace of enchantmentwhen he only clutches a handful of ashes in his fist.’ The fun had gone; Zeldahad gone—Zelda, who had once flung herself down a steep flight of steps injealousy when Isadora Duncan had indicated that she would like to go to bed withScott; who had been the symbol of his youth and success. He drifted towardsHollywood, and did some work on second-rate films. Budd Schulberg has describedhow shocked he felt when he met Fitzgerald in Hollywood—the writer he had alwaysadmired—and found him generally disregarded, patching up bad scripts. In hisnovel The Disenchanted, Schulberg gives a fictional version of how he startedFitzgerald on his last drinking session—inadvertently; at the time, Fitzgeraldhad been ‘on the wagon’ for several weeks, trying to finish his novel aboutHollywood, The Last Tycoon. As a result of the session, Fitzgerald brought on aheart attack; he died in Hollywood in December, 1940. At the time of his death,none of his work was in print. He was buried quietly—according to his ownwish—in Rockville, Maryland. As usual, critical opinion of his work began torise after his death. The publication of The Last Tycoon fragment was the signalfor a chorus of appreciation, and declarations that he belonged among the majorAmerican writers.Now, seventeen years after his death, his position is secure. The Great Gatsbyis generally recognised as one of the great novels of modern times; Tender Isthe Night has received warm critical appreciation; most of his books areobtainable in cheap reprints; Professor Mizener’s biography, The Far Side ofParadise (on which I have drawn largely for the present account), is exhaustiveand unbiased, and is unlikely to be supplanted as the standard Life.Consideration of Fitzgerald’s life takes us to the heart of the problem to bedealt with in this book. He is a product of our modern civilisation, completelytypical of it. His life was a mess. By material standards, he was a successfulman:> It seemed a romantic business to be a successful literary man—you were not> ever going to be as famous as a movie star, but what note you had was probably> longer-lived—you were never going to have the power of a man of strong> political or religious convictions, but you were certainly more independent.45Yet, without the convictions, he wrecked. Literary success is a romanticthing—at least, it will always look that way to the average person, and nowriter can deny that he wants an audience above all other things. But Fitzgeraldwas not ready for it. He was never sufficiently master of his own experience. Hedenied that ‘life was something you dominated if you were good enough,’ and yetit was precisely this failure to dominate that Hemingway put his finger on inthat passage of The Snows of Kilimanjaro:> Poor [Scott] and his romantic awe of [the rich] ... he thought they were a> special glamorous race, and when he found out they weren’t, it wrecked him> just as much as anything had wrecked him.> > He [Hemingway] had been contemptuous of those who wrecked ... He could beat> anything ... because nothing could hurt him if he did not care ... 46But perhaps diagnosing Fitzgerald’s failure is not particularly instructive,after considering such men as Rilke and Rimbaud; it is too elementary. He was aromantic, and he had considerable integrity, which survived his success andperiod of literary prostitution unscathed. In the nineteenth century, he mightnot have come to a great deal of harm; the penalties and temptations of successwere less great then. It is more interesting to wonder what would have become ofRimbaud if he had been a young American in the ’twenties, and had made his typeof ‘rebellion’ fashionable, as Fitzgerald made his in This Side of Paradise.Fitzgerald’s significance is to point out that the modern Outsider has a newproblem that did not exist in previous ages. In the past, the Outsider’s chiefenemy was the indifference of his time, his failure to communicate, failure toachieve self-expression. Ours is the first age in Western history in which theOutsider has had to face the other danger—horrifying because it is soinsidiously attractive—of arousing too much sympathy and interest, of being paidand flattered by the age ‘for telling people you feel as they do.’The ultimate significance of Fitzgerald’s predicament will emerge in thefollowing chapter, in which this question of twentieth-century civilisation mustbe looked at more closely. For the moment, it can be observed that we have comea long way from the ‘Outsider problems’ with which this chapter opened: theSwiftian contempt for human beings, the man in the cage of apes. On thecontrary, Fitzgerald was the dupe of his time; its appearance of riches andprosperity took him in. For all his talent, he was not big enough to be arepresentative figure of the twentieth century. He did not understand his ownage.I have stated that the Outsider’s problems point to the ‘visionary’ way. That isonly the answer for the individual. The avowed intention of this book is to saysomething about the need for a new religion in our time. And a religion is, bydefinition, a great deal more than a collection of religious individuals. Itmeans a Church, and a communal form of worship. It is true that the individualOutsider arrives at a fundamentally religious solution when he recognises theneed for a visionary and anti-humanistic attitude; but such a recognition isstill a long way from belonging to a Church, especially in an age like ours,when the Church would seem to have lost all contact with the problems whichbeset us.Ivan Karamazov argued that the State ought to be no more than a small corner ofthe Church. This is a view which is naturally sympathetic to the Outsider. Ifthe Church represents spiritual reality (and the Outsider is interested innothing if not in spiritual reality—even a man like Fitzgerald, with hiscontinual juggling with emotions in his art, his refusal to be finally taken inby them), then certainly the State ought to be subordinate to it; for the Staterepresents temporal expediency. But the moment the Outsider has been as bold asIvan Karamazov, and made some statement which has a practical application, hehas committed himself to a new type of problem. It is no longer the simpleOutsider problem—the ultimate metaphysical problem of the unreality of life—butthe practical problem of modern civilisation.This is—and so it should be—the ground upon which the Outsider must justifyhimself in our century. There will always be men who will say: the Outsider is astupid neurotic; his problems do not really exist; tell him to stop caterwaulingand let us get on with solving the real problems of life.But this argument is shortsighted. The real problems cannot be solved on this‘practical’ basis, as the end of our Western civilisation may prove. They canonly be solved on an Outsider basis. Two centuries ago, Blake stormed againstabstract philosophy and materialism, and his protests have even more relevancetoday. The Outsider is the key to the decline of the West.* This one-act play, which I have always considered to be Yeats’s most powerfuldramatic work, is about a seance in Dublin, in which the spirits of Stella,Vanessa and the Dean himself speak through the medium’s mouth. Vanessa pleadswith Swift to marry her and produce children; Swift protests that he believes hehas inherited insanity, and has no wish to pass it on to a child. When Vanessadenies it, Swift cries: ‘What do I care if it be healthy? .. . Am I to addanother to the healthy rascaldom and knavery of the world?’ And his totalworld-rejection is brought out by the last line of the play: Swift’s: ‘Perishthe day on which I was born!’* In fact, it has often struck me, in listening to the music of Berg, Schoenbergand Webern, that a good case could be made for calling twelve-tone music pure‘Outsider music’ in its shunning of ‘obvious’ tonal values, its preference foran intellectually contrived set of atonal values—like the reversal of algebraicpropositions in Hamilton’s ‘quaternions.’* Literally: ‘Who, if I cried, would hear me among the angelic orders?’12* Varieties of Religious Experience, Lecture VIII.* This, for me, was one of the most annoying misunderstandings of The Outsider:the attempts to classify it—and attack it—as something which it certainly didnot set out to be.* It is interesting to remember that the great archaeologist J. F. Champollionhad first revealed his own astonishing mental powers by doing precisely the samething at the age of twelve—producing a digest of world history ‘from Adam toChampollion the Younger’!* The following is a literal translation: ‘My sad heart slobbers at the stern,my heart covered with shag tobacco: they spirt soup over it, my sad heartslobbers at the stern: under the jokes of the crew, who utter a general laugh,my sad heart slobbers at the stern, my heart covered with shag tobacco!‘Their ithyphallic, barrack-room jokes have corrupted it! On the tiller one seesithyphallic, barrack-room drawings ... ’27* This is a game that I have heard spoken of as being played among boredofficers in the Occupation Army in Germany, the skill consisting in stabbingbetween the fingers at a tremendous speed. ‘Russian roulette’ is alsoplayed—twirling the chambers of a revolver containing only one bullet, pointingit at the head and firing. Both ‘games’ are obviously designed to releasenervous tension.* Actually, it was revised and considerably lengthened from an earlier versioncalled The Romantic Egotist."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO—THE OUTSIDER AND HISTORYTowards the end of 1918, an enormous volume appeared on the bookstalls ofGermany, with the provocative title: The Decline of the West.For a few weeks, no one noticed it; it lay unbought in the shops. There were noreviews. Then, slowly, people began to feel curious about the immense tome whosefirst sentence declared:> In this book is attempted for the first time the venture of predetermining> history, of following the still untravelled stages in the destiny of a Culture> ... 1Perhaps this is the reason that the book began to sell in spite of the academiccold-shoulder: possibly its first audience consisted of the people who read‘What the stars say’ in the Sunday papers. It was vast and ponderous andmetaphysical, and had many footnotes and references to historians andphilosophers; but it also professed to be a vision of the doom of ourcivilisation, a prophecy of the decline of the West. When the book became widelydiscussed, learned journals published attacks on it, and its sales rose steeply.It became something of a best seller, and the surprised publisher (who hadprinted only fifteen hundred copies) had to print a second and third and fourthimpression in quick succession. Within ten years of publication, it had sold ahundred thousand copies.No one had ever heard of its author, Oswald Spengler. Subsequent publicityrevealed that he was a former high-school teacher, with no special academicqualifications. The immense reading that supported the argument of The Declineof the West had apparently been done for his private pleasure. He was a frail,shortsighted man, with a tiny private income. Until 1910, he had been a teacherin Saarbrücken, Düsseldorf and Hamburg, teaching mathematics, biology, and evenGerman, geography and history for a period. Teaching bored him; he wanted timeto write and study (like another young writer of genius who had just thrown overhis job as a schoolteacher—D. H. Lawrence). He began a book about politics,called Conservative and Liberal—the first version of The Decline. The legend hasit that he saw a copy of Gibbon’s Decline and Fall in a bookshop in Munich, andhad his first ideas on how to re-shape his book on politics. Then the war came,and his modest income dropped below the level that means comfort even to anascetic scholar. He was forced to take cheap rooms in a slum in Munich. He atehis meals in a workman’s café. In his unheated room, he would poreshortsightedly over the manuscript of The Decline of the West. It is curious toremember that a quarter of a century earlier, Nietzsche had worked under exactlythe same conditions, handicapped by myopia and headaches, the lower part of hisbody wrapped in blankets, occasionally laying down his pen to warm his hands atthe oil lamp.By 1917, the manuscript of the first part was finished. Then began the longbusiness of submitting it to publishers, and having it returned regularly. Allthe major German publishing houses refused it. Finally, a small Austrianpublisher agreed to risk an edition of fifteen hundred copies, and the bookappeared in 1918.There can be no doubt that it was successful for the same kind of reason thatEliot’s Waste Land and Joyce’s Ulysses were successful—because it expressed anew and pessimistic attitude towards life that had absolutely nothing in commonwith pre-war attitudes. It is interesting to realise that when Schopenhauerpublished his World as Will and Idea precisely a century before, his pessimismwas so unfashionable that it took another thirty years for him to become known.Yet Schopenhauer’s book and The Decline are so similar in attitude that theycould almost be called literary brothers.Probably after The Decline had been ignored for a few weeks, Spengler began towonder whether his fate would be the same as Schopenhauer’s. In some ways, hemight have been better off if it had been; for when he died, less than twentyyears later, his name had sunk into disrepute. In Nazi Germany, Nietzscheanprophets were not required.What is it that makes The Decline such fascinating reading—as fascinating now asthe day it came out? First, because it is not in any sense an ‘academic’ book.Spengler’s intellect has a tremendous range. On one page he is quoting Goethe orBernard Shaw; on the next, talking about Einstein and modern mathematics; on thenext, about Chinese art or Greek sculpture or the influence of the Mongols onChina. He is a poet who is fascinated by all kinds of subjects. (Again, it isinteresting to note that The Waste Land and Ulysses are remarkable for thebreadth of their erudition.) One’s first feeling about The Decline is sheeradmiration for the range of this man who seems to know as much about art andmusic as about biology and mathematics.Later, one is impressed less by the literary fireworks than by the depth ofintuition, and the unified vision of history that Spengler possesses. Spenglerhimself states in one place that he has been the first to do for history whatNewton did for mathematics, shaping previously disconnected data into a coherentbody of knowledge. Before him, history had usually been regarded as a mass ofodd facts about the past. But Spengler advanced a surprising contention. Heclaimed that civilisations are like human beings: they are born, grow tomaturity, and finally die out. Human beings are made of biological cells.Civilisations are made of human beings, who die out and are replaced by newgenerations just as the cells of our bodies are completely changed every eightyears. Progress? There is no such thing. Just as every generation of humanbeings is as stupid as the last one, so it is with civilisations. The aim? Thereis no aim. It is just a biological process, like life itself.Here we enter on the Outsider’s ground. He is unwilling to accept that life isjust meaningless repetition of human futilities. This is where the Outsiderparts way with Spengler. But before we insist upon this point, let us look moreclosely at Spengler’s method of arguing.Spengler’s basic method is to compare ‘cultures.’ It must be emphasised that heconsidered that history could be made into a science, like biology or physics.There is a branch of natural history called homology, which compares similarmembers and organs of various animals; for instance, the arm of a man, and thewing of a bird and a bat. Spengler applies the same kind of technique tohistory. The whole opening chapter of The Decline is devoted to numbers.Spengler claims that every ‘culture’ has had a different idea of mathematics.There is no such thing as ‘mathematics’ in the way that there is astronomy orchemistry; there are different kinds of mathematics in different civilisations,just as there are different arts—Egyptian, Greek, Babylonian, Arabian. TheEgyptians had a strong sense of eternity—as their tombs prove; their idea ofnumber was of pure, eternal entities. The Greeks were passionately devoted tothe ‘here and now’ and never thought about eternity; their mathematics wasdevoted to the measurement of things, and was connected with the visible world.They invented geometry. Western man has a sense of time and change; his peculiaradditions to mathematics are calculus, the mathematics of change, andpermutations, the mathematics of chance.This last paragraph can only give a vague idea of the way Spengler argues—thereason being that he does not really argue. He just states. Frequently, he doesnot bother to give a reason for some assertion. He admits this frankly, claimingthat what makes the real historian—as distinguished from the academicdust-grubber—is his intuitive sense of the meaning behind events. It is the samegift that makes a great statesman or a great soldier. You cannot become a greatstatesman merely by studying the lives of Cato, Masaryk and Disraeli. You cannotbecome a great soldier by reading Clausewitz and Foch. The great statesman orsoldier has a vital intuition which he combines with his practical capacity. So,Spengler contends, has the historian.This view, of course, derives from Goethe. There is the famous story of Goetheand Schiller leaving a scientific lecture in Jena. Goethe said restively: ‘Thereis another way of apprehending nature, active and living, struggling from thewhole into parts.’ Schiller replied mistrustfully: ‘That’s not practical; it’sjust an idea of yours.’ Yet Goethe had put his finger on the central problem ofthe decline of the West.Over a hundred years were to elapse before Alfred North Whitehead settled downto defining that problem in his book Science and the Modern World. It is thequestion of the ‘bifurcation of nature.’ Knowledge has come to mean somethingdry and static and logical, and the poet’s intuition is attacked by professorsfor not being logically deduced from accepted premises. Yet, as Spengler knew,even the great mathematicians are usually artists and not logicians—Newton,Gauss, Riemann. (We shall later reinforce this point in discussing Pascal andSwedenborg.) The mark of greatness is always intuition, not logic. Ourcivilisation has unfortunately made an imaginary distinction between the two,which is called ‘philosophy.’ Existentialism is a revolt against it.It can be seen, then, that Spengler was actually a historical existentialist.This is his real importance. And although this is a very difficult point—theconcept of existentialism is as difficult for our generation as relativity wasfor the physicists of fifty years ago—it must be underlined here, for it is ofmajor importance in the problem of the Outsider. Let me be as explicit aboutthis as I can:The mediaeval Church believed that all history moved towards the Last Judgementand the establishment of the Kingdom of God. The monk Joachim of Floris, whodivided history into three periods, the ages of the Father, the Son and the HolySpirit, won a large following.With eighteenth-century rationalism, the idea of the goal of historydisappeared. History simply meant a succession of events in the past. Men wereno longer considered so important; if human history were to have a goal, thereought also to be a goal for dogs and cats and frogs and fishes. The scientificattitude replaced the religious attitude.This was all very fine in a way. Such an approach disposed of manysuperstitions. But it also implied: Human life is a journey from nowhere tonowhere. Like Darwinism, it banished free will from the universe.Spengler’s work is a rebirth of the idea of destiny and purpose.There is an excellent proverb which says: Throw out your dirty water before youget your clean. The eighteenth-century rationalists threw out the dirty water ofmediaeval concepts of purpose and man’s place in the universe. For nearly twohundred years, the bucket has been empty—although the rationalists were toodelighted with their new toy, and too deficient in the Outsider’s craving forpurpose and meaning, to notice that they had no water. But with Nietzsche andKierkegaard, there came a desire to get some clean water, a new concept of man’splace in the universe, less naive than the mediaeval concept, based on man’sknowledge of the powers of his own scepticism. Dostoevsky recognised the need inThe Devils, where Kirilov states the problem: If man says there is no God, hemust face the implication that he must be God himself. But Kirilov was aspiritual giant. Most men are spiritual pygmies, and cannot see the implicationsof their own argument.It is the same with modern philosophy. Mediaeval theology said: Man’s purpose issalvation. Men must strive to be worthy of Christ’s atonement; if they succeed,they go to heaven when they die; if not, to hell or purgatory. The eighteenthcentury dismissed all this, and stated: Man is plainly an animal, and his sinsare not the result of free will, but of social pressure and conditioning.Once again, the result was to destroy a number of naive superstitions. But italso destroyed the concept of a moral purpose. It failed to recognise that theproblems we call ‘moral problems’ continue to exist, even when we have dismissedthe idea that sinners go to hell; that moral problems are actually problems ofvitality. A man is more alive than a cow, just as a cow is more alive than atree. A man’s temperament gives him the power to become more alive or lessalive. He can drift, give way to every sensual urge, and become little betterthan a cow; or he can discipline himself, exercise his intelligence, and raisehimself to a higher form of life, automatically recognised by other men as aleader. A cow’s temperament gives it less room to alter itself, but still—asevery dairyman knows—there are stupid cows and intelligent cows. The tree has nopower to alter itself at all. Morality, then, is the power of higher forms oflife to achieve yet more life; sin is the drifting of higher forms of lifetowards an animal level. It is essentially the road of least resistance.These definitions are implied in the work of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Shaw—evenMr. Eliot.* When the eighteenth century had thoroughly established the ideas ofrationalism, the Outsiders began the existentialist revolt. The old religion wastoo naive. But so was the new rationalism. They should never have becomedivorced in the first place. In the sages of ancient India and China, greatintellect and great religious urges co-existed in the same men—Lao-tse, ChuangTzu, Manu, Vyasa; the obvious necessity is that the great artists andphilosophers of the age should also be its religious men and scientists. Thescientist should be as capable of attaining religious insight as the monk is ofunderstanding the quantum theory. The necessity today is obviously for arenaissance of the idea of purpose—of the meaning of life. This is the basis ofthe existentialist revolt. It is true, as Hulme pointed out, that we can neverreturn to the naive religion of the Church of the Middle Ages. Rationalism hasincreased man’s stature. But it has also created certain problems that threatento wreck our civilisation. And now we have arrived at the point where theOutsider and Spengler join hands. For the Outsider’s sense of urgency andapproaching doom is precisely the same sense as Spengler’s. The Outsider onlyexists because our civilisation has lost its religion. The Outsider is theresult of Whitehead’s ‘bifurcation of nature,’ and Spengler’s Decline is a studyof civilisation in which the Outsider has become the representative figure. Thebifurcation of nature is the cause of the decline of the West.Whitehead’s philosophy will be more carefully examined in the last chapter ofthis book. For readers who have never studied Whitehead, it is not essential tounderstand the ‘philosophy of organism’ at this point. All that matters now isto understand what is meant by the statement that Spengler is an existentialisthistorian. Existentialism is the revolt against mere logic and reason. It is aplea for intuition and vision. It is a plea for recognising oneself as beinginvolved in the problems of existence as a participant, not just as a spectator.All these things Spengler brought to the study of history. He was a man wholoved poetry and music, who quoted Goethe and Nietzsche endlessly, who saw evenmathematics and science as a part of the battle of the human spirit towardsgreater vision and deeper insight. Possibly his history lacks the precision andsobriety of The Cambridge Medieval History, yet his contribution is far moreimportant. Modern history moves towards the breakdown. We cannot treat it as ifwe were eternal onlookers, gifted with everlasting life, accumulating new bitsof evidence like Browning’s Grammarian. Spengler’s history has the nature of amedical diagnosis. Admittedly, he regards our decline as inevitable—just as anydoctor regards death as inevitable. Yet, whether consciously or unconsciously,he has drawn attention to the problem of the Outsider in civilisation. His verycategories of history show this existentialist approach; instead of dividinghistory into Ancient, Mediaeval and Modern (as the Cambridge dons still do) hedivides it into cultures—Apollonian, Magian, Faustian. Our modern age is theFaustian. It is significant that Spengler should choose the name of Goethe’sarch-Outsider to symbolise the West. Goethe’s Faust summarises the whole problemof the bifurcation of nature—the division of intellect into science and art. Atthe beginning of the poem, Faust stands precisely where the modern world stands.He has followed the scientific method to its limit—studied philosophy, medicine,law, and now, he admits, he ‘stands no wiser than before.’ (Recall Elijah’s‘Take away my life, O Lord ... ’) His knowledge is vanity and futility. It makeshim cleverer, but no wiser. His only way to escape is to summon up the devil,and ally himself with him, although he knows the devil is stupider than he is.Here is modern man—for all his scientific knowledge, as stupid as hisforefathers, and turning to all kinds of political charlatans forleadership—wanting only to be possessed, possessed by anything, by the latestpolitician or the latest crooner or film star—anything to escape his ownfutility and emptiness.It is impossible to give a summary of The Decline of the West here. As manycritics have pointed out, it is monstrously badly written; repetitious, obscure,confused. And yet the clarity of Spengler’s mind emerges in spite of all thesefaults. Spengler the existentialist is always making his attitude clear:> Knowledge, for Kant, is mathematical knowledge. He deals with ... the reason,> but he never thinks of the wholly different mechanism by which historical> impressions are apprehended.2> > ... Newton, Gauss and Riemann were artist-natures, and we know with what> suddenness their great conceptions came upon them.3He announced with superb certainty: ‘Systematic philosophy is at an end,’meaning by ‘systematic philosophy’ what Blake meant by ‘abstract philosophy.’ Heis slashingly impatient with modern philosophers, and although his book appearedlong before logical positivism or linguistic analysis, his criticisms might beaimed straight at Ayer and Carnap (not to mention Bertrand Russell):> A doctrine that does not attack and affect the life of the period in its> inmost depths is no doctrine and had better not be taught.4Spengler was no escapist, no Barbusse Outsider who detested being forced tolive. On the contrary, he embraced the complexity of modern civilisation:> To me, the depths and refinement of mathematical and physical theories are a> joy; by comparison, the aesthete and the physiologist are fumblers. I would> sooner have the fine mind-begotten forms of a fast steamer, a steel structure,> a precision-lathe, the subtlety and elegance of many chemical and optical> processes, than all the ... present-day ‘arts and crafts’ ... I prefer one> Roman aqueduct to all Roman temples and statues ... 5This statement might have come from a Soviet ‘realist’ philosopher. Spengler’smessage is fatalism: it is Nietzsche’s doctrine of amor fati, love of one’s owndestiny.> ... an irreligious time which coincides exactly with the idea of a world-city> is a time of decline. True. But we have not chosen this time. We cannot help> it if we are born as men of the early winter of ... Civilisation ...> Everything depends on our seeing our own position, our destiny, clearly, on> our realising that though we may lie to ourselves about it we cannot evade it> ... 6And Spengler prophesies an age of complete scepticism, which will be the laststage of Western civilisation. This he regards as the inevitable final stage ofWestern history, and, like H. G. Wells, believes that ‘there is no way out orround or through.’But let me repeat, the tremendous importance of The Decline of the West does notlie in its pessimistic conclusions, but in the luminous, vital intelligence ofOswald Spengler, who again and again makes statements of great importance to theOutsider. In a long footnote, for instance, he states that he owes thephilosophy of The Decline to Goethe, and emphasises that Goethe is actually aphilosopher of the first rank, although this is completely unrecognised today.He emphasises Goethe’s kinship with Plato as an anti-abstract philosopher (henever uses the term ‘existentialist,’ but this is the nearest he comes to it!).‘Here we have intuition opposed to analysis.’ Plato, like Goethe, is as much ofa poet and a playwright (or novelist!) as a philosopher. For Plato, it was asimportant to emphasise Socrates’ greatness as a man as to show his brilliance asa thinker. This is existentialism, and in this sense, Shaw is the only otherexistentialist thinker of the same rank as Goethe and Plato. And this is theultimate significance of the idea of the bifurcation of nature. If there are anyreaders who are still puzzled by the term, it is here that its meaning can bemost clearly seen. The great man must be great in all things, not ‘bifurcated’;not great in intellect alone, like Nietzsche or Lawrence, not great in intuitionalone, like Van Gogh, not great in body alone, like Nijinsky, but all three atonce. Only a great man is capable of great thought. Most Western philosophershave been spiritual cripples. The West has exalted the reasoning power above allother faculties, and the scientists and doctors can get away with anything. Andyet we know that a man can have an extraordinary reasoning power, and still be afool. For instance, there are certain men who are ‘calculating prodigies.’ Onecan ask them such questions as ‘Give the square root of 3,748,289,’ and theanswer will be returned in a few minutes—sometimes a few seconds. Yet thesecalculating prodigies are often stupid youths, who grow up into completelyuntalented men. In the same way, some men show an unusual talent for languages,and can master dozens of languages in the time it would take a normal person tolearn one, yet in other respects they seldom show any great intelligence. On theother hand, many men of acknowledged genius have confessed to having singularlyslow brains. Shaw and H. G. Wells were both bad at languages. Thomas Mannprotested that he had an unusually inefficient brain. Isaac Newton showed nosign of early mental development, and Beethoven never mastered the art ofmultiplying and dividing. What I wish to emphasise here is that a highlydeveloped reasoning faculty has nothing whatever to do with genius. Nothing wasever discovered by logic. All things are discovered by intuition, as the livesof the great mathematicians and scientists prove again and again. Logic plodsafter intuition, and verifies discoveries in its own pedestrian way. Logic is amere servant of the imagination. To exalt it—as modern thinkers tend to—is toinvite spiritual anarchy.The importance of all this can hardly be exaggerated in an examination of theOutsider. It is one of the basic causes of his rejection of modern civilisation.Spengler realised this clearly. The Outsider is a romantic and a mystic; andwhat is more, the essence of Western civilisation—the ‘Faustian culture’—ismystical and romantic. Western culture is the culture of Outsiders. ‘Siegfried,Parsifal, Tristan, Hamlet, Faust are the loneliest heroes in all the Cultures.’7 The West is an Outsider culture, and an attempt to analyse the Outsider’sproblems is an attempt to get to the very heart of the problems of ourcivilisation. But even to touch the surface of the problem requires unusualpenetration and intensity of mind. The Outsider is not a ‘crazy mixed-up kid.’He is not a bored and inefficient bank clerk. The essence of the Outsiderproblems lies in the need for self-transcendence. Spengler quotes Part I ofFaust:> A longing pure and not to be described> > drove me to wander over woods and fields,> > and in a mist of hot abundant tears> > I felt a world arise and live for me.8It is an experience known to a Rilke, a Rimbaud, a Goethe, an Eliot, but hardlyas common as some critics would have us believe.*Spengler, then, stated the problem of the Outsider in historical terms. Insteadof comparing human beings, as I did in The Outsider, he compares cultures, butthe result is the same: a revolt against ‘abstract philosophy’ and materialism;an anti-liberal, anti-progress attitude; an emphasis on the importance of Will.It is significant that his conclusions are so close to Nietzsche’s: a sort of‘eternal recurrence,’ the idea of amor fati, the anti-rational vitalism.But Spengler, in many ways, was closer to Schopenhauer than Nietzsche. Hispessimistic view of history was not based on reason and observation; it was atemperamental bias, the vision of a prophet. And like most prophets, he was inreaction against his time, and driven to extremes by its shortcomings, by itsspiritual laziness. Most prophets of a completely new idea tend to be extremistswho deny the element of free will: compare Darwin, Freud, Marx, Gurdjieff.As Spengler’s views became more widely known, he founded a ‘school,’ and hisfollowers tended to be less extreme in their pessimism. Spengler’s fame did notlast long in his own country. He showed himself to be anti-Nazi in his politicsin the ’twenties, and when the Nazis came to power in the ’thirties, a culturalboycott began. He never again produced a work of the same magnitude andimportance as The Decline, and his smaller works were either violently attacked,or ignored. Spengler didn’t care; he had the Nietzschean power of aloneness, andworked on quietly on some gigantic metaphysical work that was never destined tosee the light of day. He would undoubtedly have been held in high regard if hehad chosen to support the Nazis, but he had the same sort of prejudice as Yeatsabout ‘the rabble,’ and preferred to hold it in scorn. His vogue with thegeneral public had collapsed in the early nineteen-twenties, with thepublication of a political tract, Prussianism and Socialism. Readers who rushedto buy it were disappointed, and declared that the author of The Decline was amere journalist or crank. Later, as Hitler became more popular in Germany,Spengler made unflattering references to him; he commented that Hitler seemedless of a hero than a ‘heroic tenor’ from a Wagnerian opera! When the Nazistalked of the difference between Aryan and Semitic blood as the basis for theiranti-Semitism, Spengler pointed out that it was actually the clash between theold Magian culture (the Jews) and the new Faustian. A second work, Man andTechnics, was received without enthusiasm by the learned world, and a politicalvolume, The Hour of Decision, was condemned and suppressed by the Nazis. When hedied in 1936, his influence and reputation had almost disappeared; he wasregarded as a crank and a reactionary. Foreigners tended to regard him as asupporter (and inspirer) of the Nazis, just as they regarded Nietzsche at thesame time.In retrospect, we cannot help feeling of him that he ought to have stuck tohistory and prophecy, and not meddled in politics. If he had done so, he mighthave lived many years longer. His political utterances now strike us as outdatedor irrelevant. But The Decline of the West still remains one of the mostsignificant books of the twentieth century:> Each Culture has its own new possibilities of self-expression which arise,> ripen, decay, and never return. There is not one sculpture, one painting, one> mathematics, one physics, but many, each in its deepest essence different from> the others, each limited in duration and self-contained, just as each species> of plant has its own peculiar blossom or fruit, its special type of growth or> decline. These cultures, sublimated life-essences, grow with the same superb> aimlessness as the flowers of the field. They belong, like the plants and the> animals, to the living Nature of Goethe, and not to the dead Nature of Newton.> [My italics.]9It is his living vision of history that constitutes his greatness. It is anOutsider’s vision, for the Outsider is in revolt against deadness andabstraction, which contradict the life he feels within himself.To summarise, then: From Spengler, we learn that our culture is in decay, andthat a symptom of its decay is ‘abstract philosophy’ which (as Blake knew) turnsmen into pygmies. Western culture is essentially Outsider culture (Faustian);our present-day materialism is a sign of its hardening arteries. But, accordingto Spengler, there is no escape. We are in the last stages of decay, and may aswell take it for granted. There is no possibility of a new religion or a newphilosophy. The soil of the West is ‘metaphysically exhausted.’ Scepticism isthe only resource open to us; and scepticism, Spengler thinks, ought to be basedon his Decline of the West. But then, he also believed that ‘Mankind ... has noaim, no idea, no plan, any more than the family of butterflies or orchids.’10One tends to suspect that it is only Spengler’s temperamental inability toconceive a purpose for all men which leads him to this complete pessimism andscepticism. At all events, the system of history that we are to examine—that ofArnold Toynbee—has all of Spengler’s insight, without leading to the samepessimistic conclusions. It also treats the Outsider far more openly.Spengler was not entirely without predecessors as a historian. For the sake ofcompleteness, it may be well to outline, very briefly, the ideas of some ofthese previous thinkers.The first of importance is undoubtedly Giovanni Battista Vico, who was born inNaples in 1668. Vico’s thought was directed very much along the same lines asthe present book; he was equally interested in man as he might be, and man as heis—man as the Outsider conceives him, and man as history sees him. His twofavourite authors were Plato and Tacitus, because they represent these twoviewpoints. In his New Science, Vico propounds the idea of cyclic history, laterthought of by Nietzsche. (James Joyce makes the idea the basis of FinnegansWake.) Vico also recognised that civilisations begin with religious thought andprogress to abstract thought. But, living in an age of ‘progress,’ Vico did notrecognise as clearly as Spengler that the age of abstract thought precedes thedownfall of civilisations. Nevertheless, in his major work, Universal Law, heattempts to show how an evolutionary force in man makes and changes laws, andhow society depends upon the thought of its men of genius.Nearly a century after Vico’s birth, a great French thinker, Pierre Ballanche,was born in Lyons. Ballanche’s way of thinking was even closer to Spengler’s.His great unfinished book, the Palingenesis, has a tremendous sweep of ideas,ranging from man as he was before the rise of religion, to man as he mightbecome in some ultimate state of perfection. The Palingenesis falls into threesections; the first, Orpheus, deals with man as he was in prehistoric times; thesecond, The Formula, covers the same ground as Spengler (although with far lesspower and insight): he tries to deduce ‘laws of destiny’ from the known facts ofhistory. The third part (unfinished), The City of Expiations, considers what mancould become. Ballanche’s viewpoint was essentially religious. Like T. E. Hulme,he recognised the need for discipline and authority, and disliked the Rousseaunotions of ‘freedom’ and ‘progress.’ The daring and breadth of Ballanche’svision has not been recognised in this country, or in the country of his birth.It is doubtful whether Spengler had ever read him.Twenty years before Spengler began to write The Decline, two Boston brothers,Henry and Brooks Adams, were brooding on the laws of history. A young Frenchman,Alexis de Tocqueville, had visited America for six months, and as a result ofhis examination of the political scene, had written his famous Democracy inAmerica, in which, with the natural hauteur and detachment of an aristocrat, hehad castigated the notion of mob rule. De Tocqueville admired the energy and‘push’ of this new country, but he had seen too much of political unrest inEurope not to ask where it was all leading. Now, the Adams brothers, friends ofthe James family, cultured Bostonians with the same mistrust of democracy,announced that Western civilisation was decaying, and nearing its end. This wasa startling conclusion to be reached in the midst of the century of prosperityand progress, in a young and energetic country. The Adams brothers did notbecome well known or popular. Brooks wrote a book with the ominous title The Lawof Civilisation and Decay, which was mainly concerned with laws of trade andpopulation. Brooks claimed that the decay always came about when ‘surplusenergy’ created an unbearable internal tension and pressure. This is as near toa social theory of the Outsider as any nineteenth-century historian approached.Materialism increases, Brooks claimed, and imagination decreases; the result isa failure of self-expression in society as a whole that is likely to burst itapart. Brother Henry tried to be more precise about the decay of the West, andtried to work out mathematical laws—which strike modern readers in much the sameway as Newton’s scriptural calculations of the age of the world, based onArchbishop Ussher and the Book of Daniel. Henry had a temperament rather like T.S. Eliot’s; having rejected his own country and his own time, he made thepilgrimage to Europe, and found solace in its cathedrals. His finest and mostbeautiful book, Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres, is steeped in the atmosphere ofthe Middle Ages, and has the extraordinary serenity of a man who has at lastfound spiritual roots.* He has remained best known for his autobiography, TheEducation of Henry Adams. But it is in his book The Tendency of History that heconsiders all the possibilities facing our civilisation, and dismisses the ideathat our materialistic ‘progress’ could continue indefinitely, or thatworld-communism could save us; and as to the idea of a new faith and a newreligion, he states that this would be nothing less than committing suicide. Theonly hope might be for a ‘science of history’ to ‘bring into sight some new andhitherto unsuspected path for civilisation to pursue.’ The words have aNietzschean ring—but Adams had nothing to suggest.Two more thinkers of major importance should at least be mentioned in this briefaccount of Spengler’s predecessors: Georges Sorel* and Vilfredo Pareto. They areboth curious anti-revolutionary revolutionaries. Pareto jeered at Marxistideology and its ‘withering away of the state’ (he caused Lenin some sleeplessnights), and advanced his own thoroughly cynical view of history, in which thestrong seized power because of their virtues of determination and ruthlessness,and then got lazy and guileful, to be eventually turned out by a new‘aristocracy’ of strong and ruthless men. This was a new version of Nietzsche’s‘master and slave’ morality. Pareto had no political idealism at all; hisapproach was as realistic as Machiavelli’s. Although, in his Socialist Systems,he dismissed all notions of a political Heaven on Earth, he had no positivereligious ideals to advance in place of socialist systems. In his pessimism, heis very close to Spengler.Georges Sorel was, in some ways, a greater man than Pareto, although his majorwork, Reflections on Violence, is only a volume of essays that hardly compareswith Pareto’s vast work. Sorel was a convinced socialist revolutionary whodetested Marxist materialism, and insisted that socialism should have areligious basis, with a recognition of Original Sin and the need for disciplineand authority. He had no particular party allegiance, and moved freely in andout of various parties, looking for real revolutionaries who might combine toget something done; he was, in fact, a thoroughly practical man, whose beliefswere entirely mystical. (We are reminded again of Shaw’s Undershaft, themillionaire arms-king, who, when Barbara refers to him as a secularist, replies:‘On the contrary, my dear—a confirmed mystic!’) Unfortunately, he never foundhis aristocracy of revolutionaries.Other historians who should be mentioned in this connection are Jacob Burckhardtand Nicholas Danilevsky. Burckhardt was Nietzsche’s friend at Basle university,but he became less and less friendly as Nietzsche elaborated his theory of theSuperman. Burckhardt was as pessimistic about the future of the West as theAdams brothers. He is remarkable in having foreseen that the end would bepreceded by an ‘age of fuehrers,’ and elaborated this idea in his politicaltestament Force and Freedom.Danilevsky was a biologist and a botanist who wrote a polemic called Russia andEurope. The thesis of this book was that Europe was on its way out, and Russiaon its way in. Danilevsky’s ‘decline of the West’ did not include the Slaviccountries. But his analysis of the reasons for Europe’s decline was reasonablythorough. His book was published half a century before Spengler’s and statedthat ‘cultures’ were like living beings, each with a definite lifespan. Spenglerhad almost certainly never read him. One wonders what Danilevsky would havethought if he had foreseen the Westernised modern Russia squabbling with Americaabout a mere political ideology.Arnold Toynbee’s A Study of History is a record of one of the most extraordinaryspiritual journeys of our time. (It is also the longest historical work of ourtime by a single author, its total length being a great deal over 5000 pages.)In spite of its length, and the impressiveness of its erudition, it is a farmore personal work than the author is willing—at the outset, anyway—to concede.His first attempt to begin it, he admits, was cast in the form of a commentaryon a certain chorus in Sophocles:> Much is there passing strange;> > Nothing surpassing mankind.> > He it is loves to range> > Over the ocean hoar,> > Thorough the surgers’ roar,> > South winds raging behind ... 11One penetrating observer, Mr. Albert Hourani, has commented that Toynbee’s bookis ‘the product of a man of strange and powerful imagination, haunted by echoesand visions.’ In fact, the tenth (and last) volume of Toynbee’s work is full offascinating autobiographical comments which show how far Toynbee’s intuition andimagination were the sources of his Study. He describes, for instance, how> ... the writer of the present Study had an authentic minor personal experience> ... as he sat musing on the summit of the citadel of Mistra, with the sheer> wall of Mount Taygetus bounding his horizon in the western quarter of the> compass, towards which he was bound, and the open vale of Sparta stretching> away in the opposite eastern quarter, from which he had made his way that> morning.> > Though he had sat there, musing and gazing (and prosaically taking the edge> off his hunger by consuming slabs of Pavlidhis’ chocolate) through most of a> long summer’s day, till the gloom of evening constrained him reluctantly at> last to move on in search of supper and a bed at Trypi, he cannot pretend he> was inspired during his reverie on the summit by any strains from the throats> of the nuns serving the church ... for he had left this far below in his> spiral ascent of the miniature purgatorial mount that the citadel crowned ...> The sensuous experience that activated his historical imagination ... was the> sight of the ruins among which he had wound his way upwards to the peak ...> > Mistra had continued ... to reign for ... six hundred years as the queen of> the broad landscape that could be surveyed from her topmost battlements; and> then, one April morning, out of the blue, the avalanche of wild highlanders> ... had overwhelmed her ... and her ruins had been left desolate from that day> to this.12And Toynbee confessed that his feeling was ‘a horrifying sense of the sinmanifest in the conduct of human affairs.’ It was this vision of ‘the cruelriddle of Mankind’s crimes and follies’ that inspired A Study of History.It is immediately observable that Toynbee is bringing a moral sense, a sense ofmeaning and purpose, to his study. In the first volume, he praises the ambitiousscope of H. G. Wells’s Outline of History, and attacks the ‘historicalspecialists’ who sneered at Wells’s work, because it had achieved something‘which they themselves would hardly have dared to attempt.’ Toynbee’s own work,he implies, will have something in common with Wells’s.At once we recognise the similarity of aim to Spengler’s book. There is noevidence that Toynbee was influenced by Spengler (his references to Spenglerare, in fact, rather unfair), yet the same hostility to pedantry is apparentfrom the beginning. Toynbee’s attitude, like Spengler’s, was existentialist. Heprotested against those historians who write as if they are in some way standingoutside history. This is precisely the same as the existentialist’s dislike ofphilosophers who write as if they were standing outside life. One of the mostimportant contentions of the Study appears in the section called Challenge andResponse. Toynbee points out that so far, he had been using the ‘scientificmethod’ to examine the problems of civilisation. But this method contains afallacy—the opposite of Ruskin’s ‘pathetic fallacy.’ The pathetic fallacy meansendowing a dead object with life—swearing at the bedstead on which you’vestubbed your toe. The opposite of this is to pretend that a living thing isdead; to apply the ‘scientific method’ to something that is alive, and refusesto submit to scientific categories. Here again, we have existentialism. Andimmediately, Toynbee hits on a simile which describes civilisation—and alsodescribes the Outsider: a sleeper who has awakened on a ledge of a cliff, andhas started to climb the cliff face. Until he wakes up and begins to strive forhigher things, he is safe. As soon as he begins to climb, he is in danger offalling. This was also Gurdjieff’s image for human beings: they are safe whilethey are asleep, but when they wake up, the danger begins.> In the language of our simile, Faust is saying: ‘I have made up my mind to> leave this ledge and climb this precipice in search of the ledge above. In> attempting this, I am aware that I am courting danger and deliberately leaving> safety behind me... Yet, for the sake of the possible achievement, I am ready> to take the inevitable risk.’13This is close to Nietzsche’s simile, comparing man to a tightrope stretchedbetween beast and superman.And at this point, Toynbee propounds his doctrine of Challenge and Response. Histheory is a denial of Darwin’s Natural Selection. He does not believe that menflourish under the easiest conditions. On the contrary, they flourish most underthe circumstances that challenge them most. The greater the challenge, thegreater the men who meet it. Toynbee cites a number of examples to prove hispoint that the hardest conditions produce the greatest men:* Rome and Capua, theYellow River and the Yangtse, Attica and Boeotia, Byzantium and Calchedon, andmany more, all offering the same contrast—the people under easy conditions whoare weak; the people under difficult conditions who are strong.* To bespiritually and culturally great, a civilisation needs the challenge of adifficult environment.Is it possible, then, to formulate a law: ‘The greater the challenge, thegreater the stimulus’?No, not as simply as that. For after all, some civilisations respondsuccessfully to certain challenges while others fail. The forests of NorthernEurope baffled primitive man, yet the Romans built flourishing communities amongthem. The same is true of the white settlers in the forests of North America,who responded to the challenge where the Indians had failed.What, then, makes the difference between a successful civilisation and anunsuccessful one?And here Toynbee formulates one of his most valuable conceptions: that of‘creative minorities.’ In this, he was influenced by Bergson, who, in his TwoSources of Morality and Religion, states his belief that civilisations progressbecause of individuals, not because of ‘subterranean currents of thought’ or‘the great unconscious soul of the race.’ It is the conception which HarryHaller, the Steppenwolf, expressed: the Outsiders and men of genius are thespearheads of society; without them, society would fall to pieces.Toynbee calls the Outsider ‘the creative minority’ (mentioning, at the sametime, that it can be a minority of one). The creative minority is the fewindividuals who are capable of meeting the challenges that confront a society.How do they do this? Once again, the reason is of immense interest in a study ofthe Outsider: by a process of ‘withdrawal and return.’ These solitary creativeindividuals withdraw from society into solitude and there wrestle with theproblems alone. There, in solitude their vitality and insight increases; andwhen they emerge, it is with the power to stimulate the rest of society toovercome the challenges.And now an even more important problem arises. How does the man of geniuspersuade the uncreative majority to follow him? ‘The direct kindling of creativeenergy from soul to soul is no doubt the ideal way,’ but it is not practical—forthose reasons that the wise Grand Inquisitor pointed out. The other way is by‘drill’—by laying down laws, and making sure that everyone follows them; byusing all the powers of the leader and lawgiver: bullying, persuading, cajoling,legislating. All of this Toynbee calls ‘mimesis.’ Mimesis is the power used bythe Outsider to persuade other people to follow his advice.Toynbee has a long and fascinating section in his third volume, in which heanalyses various great men—ranging from the Buddha, Saint Paul and Mohammed toDante, Kant and Hindenburg—to show this movement of ‘withdrawal and return’—apassage that might have been headed ‘the Outsiders.’ (It should be added that AStudy of History is full of annexes on all kinds of subjects, ranging fromancient mythology to modern philosophy, and that these can be read almost likeseparate volumes of essays.)But why, then, do civilisations decline?Because the creative minorities fail them. And here again, we skirt the views ofSpengler and Pareto. The man of genius must have the qualities of a leader. Itwas Spengler who complained that the modern thinkers and artists have no leaderqualities. It was Pareto who pointed out that the ‘ruling classes’ decline asthey allow themselves to relax and become decadent, effete.Toynbee uses the Greek word for this, and calls it hybris, which can betranslated pride, conceit, swelled-headedness, egotism. The very fact that acivilisation has met one challenge successfully means that it relaxes and getsout of condition, and probably fails to meet the next one.Hybris, in one form or another, is the cause of the breakdown of civilisations.For instance, a nation that develops an effective army to meet the challenge ofbarbarians at its frontiers is likely to become militaristic, and the militarymentality is invariably stupid. This stupidity prevents it responding tochallenges that require intelligence, and also means that it suppressesOutsiders, and tries to drill them into a military mould. (The appalling resultscan be seen in the case of a Rilke.) Having crippled its Outsiders, it crashes.Modern Western civilisation is in this position.It will be fairly apparent to most readers that this problem which Toynbee talksof in terms of civilisations is also the Outsider’s problem. We considered anaspect of it in a writer like Hemingway, for instance, whose early books stateimportant problems, and who seems to become less and less important as hebecomes more successful. Later Hemingway seems to repeat the elements that madethe early books successful—the violence and emotional tension, all conveyed byunderstatement—but it is only the hardened form of the earlier technique, and nonew advances are made. Contrast this with someone like Yeats or Beethoven, whosucceeded in developing right up to the end: there is an element of humility andself-examination in both of them.What Toynbee has actually done is to make a major anti-materialistic statement.Not only do individuals depend upon moral vitality to create and evolve:civilisations need it too. It is pure anti-Marxism. Marxism states:Civilisations develop according to economic pressures; there is no free will.Toynbee states: Civilisations flourish or decline according to the moralvitality of the ‘creative minority,’ and the words ‘moral vitality’ would bemeaningless if free will did not exist.It is illuminating to see how Toynbee’s revolt against materialism follows thelines of the Lamarckian revolt against Darwin.* Darwin’s evolution wascompletely materialistic. If giraffes with the longest necks are common today,it is only because giraffes with short necks died out because they couldn’treach the highest trees, and the long-necked giraffes mated and produced morelong necks. Darwin calls this ‘the survival of the fittest,’ or ‘accidentalselection,’ meaning that it is quite accidental which giraffes happen to be bornthe fittest in the first place. Lamarck held that giraffes have long necksbecause they wanted to develop them; that, as the food became scarcer on thelower branches of trees, the giraffes strove to reach the higher branches, andwilled their necks to grow longer.To any sensible person, Lamarck’s plan is far more plausible. Obviously, onedevelops muscles—or any other faculty—when one’s survival depends on it.Difficult circumstances don’t simply kill one off—which is what Darwin impliedhappened to short-necked giraffes; they represent a challenge to which oneresponds. This is Lamarckian evolution.Toynbee is to Spengler what Lamarck is to Darwin. For him, there is a narrowpossibility of the West surviving. But before we speak of this, it is necessaryto examine more closely Toynbee’s views of the disintegrating society.Growth, according to Toynbee, means simply progress towards self-determination.Self-determination means self-control and self-discipline, and mastery of one’sown problems. It is, in other words, precisely what the Outsider is strivingfor.But what does Toynbee regard as the central disintegrating force?The answer is: Mimesis, that very power of persuasion or authority by which thecreative minority established their own will. ‘All action that proceeds fromMimesis is essentially precarious because it is not self-determined.’14 Thissounds rather obscure, and perhaps an example will help to clarify it.In his tract The Perfect Wagnerite, Shaw explains that Wagner’s Ring of theNibelung is actually a political allegory.Readers who know Wagner’s music drama will remember the story of how Wotan, theleader of the Gods, gives away one of his eyes in exchange for Fricka. Frickabrings him, as her dowry, all the forces of the Law.Wotan is the pure force of creativeness; he is the poet, the visionary, theidealist, the man of genius through whose dreams and visions all civilisationadvances. He is a clear mirror in which the Will of the Life Force is reflected.But as a visionary, he has no practical power; his visions stay in his ownbrain. That is why he needs the alliance with Fricka, who brings him the powerof the Law—the power to put his visions into practice. But in exchange forFricka, he has to give away one of his eyes: that is to say, the man of puregenius has to compromise when he wants the power to put his ideals into action.When the philosopher is made king, he has to do all kinds of disagreeablethings—like maintaining law and order by force, suppressing rebellion (althoughhe may sympathise with the rebels), executing criminals. He has to make laws tosuit the majority. He has to compromise, to consult expediency, instead ofcaring for nothing but his visions.In Wagner’s opera, we see how Wotan, the visionary, is forced to do more andmore underhand things—to trick Alberich the dwarf out of the Rhinegold, to trickthe stupid giants who build his Valhalla out of claiming Freia, thelove-goddess, to kill his son Siegmund—until his compromises lead to hisdownfall, and the ‘nightfall on the Gods.’The moral of all this is clear. The moment the man of genius starts to put hisvisions into practice, he compromises his integrity, and a certain amount of‘dirty work’ becomes inevitable. The moment the Outsider comes out of hiscork-lined room and tries to realise his ideals, the compromise begins.Wagner’s Ring is a parable about Mimesis. Wotan is his ‘creative minority.’ Thesin and brutality and folly of history are the inevitable results of the urgetowards higher forms of life. Toynbee has reached the same conclusions aboutcivilisation that the Steppenwolf reached about Outsiders: all life, after all,is a compromise between spirit and nature, and consequently the compromisebegins the moment life begins:> Every created thing, even the simplest, is already guilty, already multiple> ... The way to innocence, to the uncreated and to God, leads on, not back, not> back to the wolf or the child, but ever further into guilt, ever deeper into> human life.15And the same applies to civilisations.The compromise—the creative minority putting their will into action—is all verywell to begin with, for the minority are still fresh from their vision, full ofintegrity and determination. But sooner or later, their success leads them to‘sin’—that is, either leads them to become lazy and relaxed, or harsh andtyrannical. In either case, the breakdown begins.Then, according to Toynbee, the creative minority becomes merely a dominantminority, holding power by privilege, no longer by genius. The Outsiders thentend to withdraw into their own ivory tower, and become what Toynbee calls an‘internal proletariat,’ while the majority become the ‘externalproletariat’—dissatisfied and rebellious underdogs. This, Toynbee says, is thestate of our society today.These three groups—the Dominant Minority, the External and Internalproletariats—dislike one another. The leaders try to hold on to their power withmore force than ever; the External proletariat reacts by rebelling, while theInternal proletariat becomes more internal and ‘subjective’ than ever. But inthese last stages of society, the three groups sometimes achieve superhuman actsof creation. The leaders strive to create a Universal State; the Outsidersstrive to create a Universal Church; and the proletariat often produces barbaricart, epic poetry, heroism.In this stage, only the Universal Church may survive in the new civilisationthat replaces the old one—if a new civilisation arises out of the chaos. In itslast throes, the dying civilisation produces Saviours who try to lead it out ofits impasse. But this only leads to a gigantic effort of recuperation whichprecedes complete collapse.This, then, is Toynbee’s vision of history—a vision to which he brings atremendous wealth of illustration and example. It is true that many modernhistorians doubt the validity of Toynbee’s demonstrations; one hostile critichas even gone so far as to refer to Toynbee as ‘a reader of tea-leaves.’ Ingeneral this would seem to be only another example of the hostility of mereacademics to any work of creative imagination that trespasses on their domain of‘fact.’ But, as I have summarised it, his theory leaves a lot of questionsunanswered.The ideal of a civilisation is to become ‘self-determined.’ But what then? It islike saying that the ideal aim of a man is to be perfectly self-controlled. Butto what end? A man might strive for self-control in order to be a better soldieror thinker or artist or saint; but self-control is no end in itself.In the first volume, Toynbee states his idea of the purpose of all this march ofcivilisation: it is the vitalist concept of ‘the transformation of Sub-Man,through Man into Superman.’ This idea underlies the whole work. But by VolumeVI, when the basic ideas are all enunciated, the underlying religious notionshave come to the surface. In the last four volumes—published twenty years afterthe first three—Toynbee’s religious ideas are discussed openly and exhaustively.It is true, perhaps, that the last four volumes are less readable than the firstsix; they are altogether heavier, more obscure. Yet from our point of view, theyare the most fruitful volumes of the work. It should also be mentioned that thehostility to Toynbee in academic circles did not really begin until after thepublication of these last volumes—and, of course, of the one-volume condensationof the first six that appeared shortly after the war. The general feeling seemedto be that if you are going to talk about history, you should talk abouthistory, not about religion. But it is in these last volumes that Toynbeecompletes his concept of history. Now he is more candid about his notion thatall history is the manifestation of God in matter. The aim for the individual—atany time and in any place—is the vision of God; the only thing worth strivingfor is sainthood. And it is significant that Jung’s theory of ‘psychologicaltypes’ was one of the major influences on his religious thinking. Jung’spsychological types correspond roughly to the three types of Outsider that Ihave named: the ‘physical,’ the ‘emotional’ and the ‘intellectual.’ The notionof hybris now becomes more precise; hybris is enclosure in the personality, andpermitting the personality to take the place of the vital impulses. Man is atelephone line between God and the world, and his business is to be as receptiveas possible.This viewpoint is partly a contradiction of the views of the earlier volumes,where religion was regarded as simply a response to circumstances, a comfort inthe face of death, a system of superstitions to explain the unknown destiny ofman. Now, Toynbee’s views have become wider and deeper. He sees the sameessential truth in all religions—the same attempt to assert the reality of thespirit, the relative unimportance of the problems of our space-and-time world.The ultimate creative vision is a vision of love, of pure affirmation towardsall existing things, and for this reason, Toynbee prefers Christianity toBuddhism.Toynbee’s religious doctrine is ultimately, perhaps, the same as Aldous Huxley’sin The Perennial Philosophy—all religions are different ways to the same truth.This, I believe, is undeniably true—but it still leaves the real problemunsolved. The real problem is this: the element in any religion that makes it abinding force in a civilisation is an element of myth and dogma, not of‘universal truth.’ For Christianity to be fully satisfying, the Christian has tobelieve that Christ was the incarnation of God, and that all men are redeemedthrough him. If the churches proclaimed tomorrow that Christ was no better thanKrishna or Mohammed, the result would be a general falling-off fromChristianity. It is a pity, but it is true—as the Grand Inquisitor knew. If itis to be as acceptable to the average navvy as to the saint and philosopher,religion must be more than the philosopher’s perception of ‘eternal truth’—itmust be myth, dogma and ritual.But there is no point in attacking Toynbee for these shortcomings. What is mostimpressive is the positive achievement of his work. Everything that Toynbee haslearned or read or experienced goes into it sooner or later. It is the record ofa spiritual journey—the spiritual journey of a modern man, equipped with thesame weapons as John Stuart Mill or T. H. Huxley, and yet aware of theinadequacy of mere rationalism, and striving for a faith. The result ofToynbee’s vision of history is a realisation that history is the attempt ofspirit to conquer matter; and the question that it ends with is the samequestion that we arrived at in The Outsider: How does one become a visionary?Toynbee makes it clear that he feels that history leads towards vision:> ... the historian’s inspiration is preparing him for an experience that has> been described as ‘the Beatific Vision’ by souls to whom it has been> vouchsafed.16There can, unfortunately, be no doubt that it is the nature of Toynbee’s beliefsthat makes him so unpopular among academic historians today. A Study of Historybegins and ends in moral concepts. A second reason is probably that there is somuch of Toynbee himself in the book. The last volume (which no doubt mostreaders find the most interesting and readable section) explains at length howthe book came to be written, and is also a sort of spiritual autobiography,Toynbee’s Ecce Homo. The book’s immense popularity (in America, for instance) isundoubtedly due to this strong personal element, and to the moral approach—thevery reasons that lay Toynbee open to suspicion among his fellow historians.Before we speak of this autobiographical element, there is an important questionto be answered; a question that takes us back to the root of the Outsiderproblem. It will be remembered that Kierkegaard’s detestation of Hegel was basedon Hegel’s attempt to tie up the whole universe in a ‘System.’ Kierkegaardprotested, in effect: ‘I will not be a mere element in your system; I am.’ NowHegel’s major attempt at System-building is to be found in his two volumes ThePhilosophy of History and The Philosophy of Religion* and in these two volumes,he does rather the same sort of thing as Toynbee: discovers a ‘meaning’ inhistory, declaring that all history moves towards the manifestation of God. Why,then, if we cannot accept Hegel, can we accept Toynbee?There are two reasons. The first is that Kierkegaard had never read Hegel; hehad only read interpretations of him.* Hegel’s thought is actually more subtlethan Kierkegaard ever gives him credit for. (In fact, it is likely that Hegel’sfinal synthesis was based on some mystical experience; he is very far from beinga mere philosopher.) But the second reason is more important: Toynbee alwaysputs religion first; Hegel always thought that religion and art were inferior tophilosophy to express man’s relation to the absolute. For all his religiousinsight, he was heavily tainted with naive rationalism. And now one can see moreclearly why Toynbee’s views are regarded with suspicion by other historians. Thereaction against rationalism has not yet reached the academic world. Theprofessors of England and America are mostly committed to nineteenth-centuryscientific attitudes. The existentialist revolt has not yet affected them. Onthe Continent, existentialism has been accepted since the early ’thirties; itstime has yet to come in England and America.In the tenth volume, Toynbee speaks of the personal experiences that lie behindA Study of History. What can be said of his approach? At the first glance, itwould seem to be romantic and ‘literary.’ Almost every page has some quotationfrom the Bible, or Greek drama, or poetry, or the Church Fathers, and it wouldhardly be untrue to say that, wherever he can, he prefers to express a thoughtin somebody else’s words rather than his own. There is an air of anthologisingabout the Study. (For instance, in the two pages that I happen to have open atthe moment, I can count ten quotations from the Bible, two from Pascal, one fromPlato, one from Rumi, one from Byron and one from Shirley.) This ‘literary’element is apparent all the way through; the romantic element is less obviousuntil the last volume. There, he speaks of the inspiration of historians, andtries to show that almost every great work of history has been inspired by asudden firing of the imagination. He tells how he himself had been impressed byhearing one of his schoolmasters at Winchester recount the life of HeinrichSchliemann, the father of modern archaeology and the discoverer of Ancient Troy.(Schliemann was the arch-romantic, who set out to find the ruins of legendaryTroy on no better evidence than a passage in Homer, and a picture of Troy heonce saw in some child’s story book; the picture convinced him that walls sothick could never have been completely destroyed.)Yet, as Toynbee shows, if this is romanticism, it is the inspiration of almostevery great work that has ever been undertaken. It should be called, rather,‘imaginative vision.’ In this form, it can immediately be listed among theanswers to our question: How does one become a visionary? It is a deliberatediscipline of the imagination to develop a sense of personal participation inhistory. It may take place in an obvious and simple way, as in the first exampleToynbee gives:> ‘Mutilus, one of the proscribed leaders ... succeeded, by muffling his> countenance, in making his way undetected to the back of his wife Bastia’s> house—only to be refused admittance: she taxed him with having a price on his> head. His retort was to plunge his blade into his breast and spatter his> wife’s door with his blood.’> > As the student read this quickening passage ... he was transported, in a> flash, across the gulf of Time and Space from Oxford in A.D. 1911 to Teanum in> 80 B.C. to find himself in a back yard on a dark night witnessing a personal> tragedy that was more bitter than the defeat of any public cause.17It is interesting to note how Toynbee refers to himself in the third person as‘the student’; this modesty, this refusal to speak of himself in the firstperson, is apparent throughout the Study.Toynbee gives five more examples of the same land of experience in the pagesthat follow: reading Bernal Diaz on his first sight of the approaches toTenochtitlán in Mexico, or Villehardouin describing his first sight ofConstantinople during the Crusades, or a sudden vision of a battle seen on somebattleground of the past, Pharsalus or Gettysburg. Once, in the theatre atAncient Ephesus, the auditorium had seemed to become peopled with an angrycrowd:> On each of the six occasions just recorded, the writer had been rapt into a> momentary communion with the actors in a particular historic event through the> effect upon his imagination of a sudden arresting view of the scene in which> this long-past action had taken place. But there was another occasion on which> he had been vouchsafed a larger and a stranger experience. In London in the> southern section of the Buckingham Palace Road, walking southward along the> pavement skirting the west wall of Victoria Station, the writer, once, one> afternoon not long after the end of the First World War—he has failed to> record the exact date—had found himself in communion, not just with this or> that episode in History, but with all that had been, and was, and was to come.> In that instant, he was directly aware of the passage of History gently> flowing through him in a mighty current, and of his own life welling like a> wave in the flow of this vast tide. The experience lasted long enough for him> to take visual note of the Edwardian red brick surface and white stone facings> of the station wall gliding past him on his left, and to wonder—half amazed> and half amused—why this incongruously prosaic scene should have been the> physical setting of a mental illumination.18Toynbee’s approach to history has something in common with Einstein’s revolutionin science. Einstein destroyed the idea of absolute measurements of space ortime, and insisted on the part of the observer in scientific calculation.Toynbee’s vision of history begins from the historian and his imagination. It isa denial of the abstract; an insistence on the personal. He sees history, not asa science, but as a mode of spiritual discipline. He insists that, in ourpresent age, the thinker should remain uncommitted as far as possible. He quotesMelville in Moby Dick to this effect: ‘All deep, earnest thinking is but theintrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea,’ and tellsof a dream that he had once:> ... in a time of physical sickness and spiritual travail, he dreamed, during a> spell of sleep in a wakeful night, that he was clasping the foot of the> crucifix hanging over the high altar of the Abbey of Ampleforth and was> hearing a voice saying to him Amplexus expecta (‘Cling and wait’).19Toynbee’s answer to the question: ‘Can Western civilisation be saved?’ is theanswer that Shaw had propounded in Back to Methuselah: Only by a return to areligious attitude. But what religion? Toynbee’s answer is vague. It would seemto be a sort of compound of all religions—like Huxley’s perennial philosophy.Yet he is not pessimistic about our chance of survival:> ... in the second quarter of the twentieth century ... Western Civilisation> was perhaps the only extant representative of its species that did not show> indisputable signs of being already in disintegration ... Western Civilisation> ... was apparently in the singular position of being the only one ... whose> present state and future prospects might still be open questions. While all> the others were either certainly dead or almost certainly in articulo mortis,> the Western Society alone was possibly still in its growth-phase.20He asks the question: ‘What were the Western Civilisation’s expectations of lifein A.D. 1950 or 1952?’ and considers various answers.The first is: Pretty small. Western Civilisation is just one of about thirtycivilisations that have smashed and disintegrated; Nature has made thirty or soattempts, and Nature usually makes a thousand or so attempts before succeeding.But that is to assume that a civilisation and an individual species are subjectto the same rules. A civilisation is a far more complicated thing than a plantor an insect; thirty experiments may not be such a ridiculously low figure. Atall events, we cannot condemn our civilisation out of hand because it is onlyNature’s thirtieth attempt, and Nature usually takes several thousand tries tomake a species worth perpetuating. The rules may be different. On the otherhand, he quotes Gibbon and Paul Valery as two types of ‘feeling’ about Westerncivilisation, Gibbon’s optimistic, Valery’s pessimistic, and demonstrates thatthese ‘feelings’ are just as unreliable as statistics based on biology. Heexamines the state of the world in 1952 (the date of writing), speaks of theproblems of atomic warfare, and raises the question of world government. Itbecomes evident by this time that he has taken the question as far as he isable—and this, throughout the ten volumes, has been an immense distance. He hasno definite prophecy to make about the future of the West: only a feeling thatit is just possible that the West may survive where other civilisations havefailed. He points out that it is inconceivable what will happen if the Westdoesn’t survive. In previous ages, some new culture emerged to replace the oldone; but nowadays the world is a smaller place, and it is difficult to see wherea new culture could come from. All the world is westernised. He raises also theimportant question of leisure in a highly civilised society, pointing out thatleisure is usually a corrupting influence. To this purpose, he quotes theanonymous Greek work on Sublimity in Style, written at some time between thefirst and third century; the author’s words could be applied to the twentiethcentury:> One of the cancers of the spiritual life in souls born into the present> generation is the low spiritual tension in which all but a few chosen spirits> among us pass their days ... 21This was also written in a disintegrating civilisation in times of peace andprosperity; it enforces the point that all declining civilisations tend todivide into Outsiders and Insiders. Shaw, with his usual penetration, hadsummarised the whole of this problem in his preface to Misalliance:> The secret of being miserable is to have leisure to bother about whether you> are happy or not. The cure for it is occupation ... A perpetual holiday is a> good working definition of hell.22Toynbee states it in his own way:> ... Technology had inveigled her victims into putting themselves into her> power by selling them new lamps for old. She had bribed them with ‘the> pictures’ and ‘the wireless’ into selling her their souls; and the outcome of> this ruinous cultural ‘new deal’ was the spiritual wilderness which Plato had> dismissed as a ‘Commonwealth of Swine,’ and Aldous Huxley had satirised as a> ‘Brave New World.’ 23At the end of the Study, Toynbee places his hope for the future of the West in‘a transfer of energy from Economics to Religion.’ He does not say how thistransfer is to be brought about. But he is certain that ‘under the aegis ofReligion, Western Man might find himself able to handle with spiritual impunitythe material power thrust into his hands by the mechanisation of Westerntechnology.’24 It is Toynbee’s own attempt to answer Evan Strowde’s question:‘How can the spirit of man gain power over his prosperity?’Toynbee has expressed the historical aspect of the Outsider problem so clearlythat there is little more to say. Our society is spiritually rotten, and theOutsider is the lone individual who instinctively rebels against it. All livingcreatures live mainly by instinct, and man is no exception. But when acivilisation reaches its phase of disintegration, an instinct for health is notenough; intuition needs a spearhead of conscious intellectual effort. TheOutsider was a study in many individuals who made that effort, and who, to agreater or lesser degree, recovered spiritual health. The Outsider usuallybegins as a romantic and a sceptic; and usually, he ends with neo-classic andreligious convictions. In the twentieth century, this development is common tofigures as diverse as Bernard Shaw and T. S. Eliot. (Their similarity in this,and many other respects, is only just beginning to be observed.) It is a patternso common that one could venture a generalisation and say it is true of allOutsiders.The implication becomes obvious: a healthy culture takes its religion andclassicism for granted, and there are no Outsiders. (Can the seventeenthcentury, for instance, produce any musical ‘Outsiders’ to compare with Wagner orAlban Berg?) In an unhealthy (romantic) culture, the Outsider has to remake hisown classicism and religious attitude, and thus regains a certain degree ofhealth. If the whole civilisation began to feel the need to fight for a newlease of life, it would have to follow the same path as the individual Outsider.Immediately, the objections raised by the Grand Inquisitor bulk on the horizon.Society is not made up of Outsiders, and never has been. When society has beenmost healthy, it has been in ages when the Outsiders were the spiritual leaders,and the mass of the people accepted them in the way that a modern man acceptsthe word of Einstein or Planck for some scientific mystery he cannot understand.In our age, the Outsider is no longer the intellectual leader, no matter howmuch society may admire the paintings of Van Gogh, or the novels of Dostoevsky.The intellectual leader of the twentieth century is the scientist, thepsychologist, the statistician, the positivist philosopher (consider the immenseinfluence of Dewey in America, or Russell in England), and these men are notOutsiders. In former ages, the great churchmen were often Outsiders—there are ahundred examples from Augustine to Newman. In the twentieth century, thereligious man has neither authority nor credit, and the occasional Outsider whoaccepts the authority of the church—Berdyaev, Shestov, Eliot—thereby isolateshimself and decreases his sphere of influence. The most influential seriouswriters today stand outside the Church, as Camus and Sartre stand outside; theirinfluence is largely due to the stoicism they preach, reminiscent of Toynbee’sdream with its ‘Cling and wait.’The Grand Inquisitor’s logic blocks all hope of a return to religion.* A newreligion would mean the general acceptance of religious dogmas. Even if thesedogmas were drawn up by an assembly of bishops—and this would be less difficultthan it sounds—the problem would still be to get the half-educated modern man toswallow them. There can be no ‘new religion.’ A religion is not made by throwingingredients into a cooking pot. And what the Outsider means by ‘religion’ is asincomprehensible to the average man as the quantum theory. A religion dependsprimarily on a climate of opinion which demands it, and that climate has not yetappeared in our civilisation. There are signs—it is true—that such a climate isbeginning to appear; these signs are more apparent on the Continent, wherequestions of theology and philosophy are habitually discussed, than in Englandor America. But, so far, there is no indication that anything as universal as areligion is emerging.The problem that confronts us is a problem of rebirth. Spengler declared thatcivilisations are never reborn. Toynbee is guardedly optimistic; his advice issummarised in his words ‘Cling and wait.’If our civilisation could survive—if any civilisation could pass beyond itsdanger-point without disintegrating—it would be by an effort of self-knowledgesurpassing that of any previous civilisation: a sort of historical introspectionthat could be compared to Pascal’s spiritual self-analysis. Re-creation byself-analysis is the most fundamental meaning of existentialism. Perhaps, asToynbee suggests, the burden of re-creation will lie with a minority ofOutsiders.The conclusions of this chapter can be briefly summarised: Civilisations wreckwhen they lose control over their own complexity. And they begin to lose controlthe moment they begin to think in materialist categories; for ultimately, allpower is spiritual power.Western man—Faustian man—has always been inclined to lay too much emphasis onhis intellect. This is the secret of his tremendous material progress; but it isalso the cause of his downfall. He loses spiritual power—the vital sense thatkeeps species healthy. Without this vital sense, the word ‘progress’ is amockery; it is like having a streamlined car, but no petrol to run it on.This tradition of over-emphasising the intellect goes back to the Renaissance,when the humanist way of thinking first began to flourish. But it gained realpower in the seventeenth century, with Galileo, Descartes, Newton, expandingthrough Locke and Hume, Kant and Hegel, until in the twentieth century it hasinvaded every branch of thought from philosophy to sociology, from physics topsychology. The full significance of this will appear when I speak of Whiteheadin the last chapter of this book.But there is another tradition of thought in the West—a tradition that has runparallel to ‘abstract philosophy,’ although its influence has never been sogreat. It is a religious tradition and—as I shall try to show in the followingpages—an existentialist tradition. It is this tradition which I propose toexamine in the second part of this book.* ‘Make perfect your Will.’ The Rock.* Within a month of the publication of The Outsider, I received over a thousandletters which began by claiming that the writer was an ‘Outsider.’ In manycases, this may have been so, but hardly in the sense that I have implied above.* The relief with which he turned to mediaeval cathedrals may be criticised asescapism—like Mr. Eliot’s acceptance of the Anglican communion—but I think thatno one can read Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres without coming as completelyunder the spell of the Christian Church in the Middle Ages as Henry Adams andMr. Eliot.* The most easily available introduction to Sorel, for English readers, is theessay by T. E. Hulme, to be found in Appendix A of Speculations.* It is impossible not to be reminded of Yeats’s passage in The Trembling of theVeil contending that great men are produced by ‘crisis’: ‘They [the fates] bringour souls to crisis. They contrived Dante’s banishment ... and thrust Villoninto the arms of harlots... that Dante and Villon might become conjoint to theirburied selves ... ’ And in language very close to that of Toynbee: ‘They havebut one purpose, to bring their chosen man to the greatest obstacle he mayconfront without despair.’It is interesting to note how closely Yeats’s ‘cyclic’ theory of the individual(in A Vision) corresponds to Spengler’s cyclic theory of civilisation—andVico’s.* Pareto, of course, made precisely the same observation in his SocialistSystems, published in 1902: the privileged classes become lazy, and aresupplanted by tougher men who have been brought up under harder conditions.* This will be dealt with more fully in speaking of Shaw.* His most difficult book, The Phenomenology of Spirit, is an earlier stage ofhis ‘System.’* He attended Schelling’s anti-Hegelian lectures in Berlin in 1842.* I am dismissing, of course, the ‘religion’ preached by ‘hot gospel’evangelists which causes periodic revivals of religious emotion. Religion andreligious emotion are not the same thing."},{"pageContent":"PART TWO"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION—THE MAKING OF A RELIGIONI have said that this book must be prepared to pursue two lines of argument atonce. And the historical argument begins with this truism: Society must be heldtogether by a discipline. This may seem so obvious as to be hardly worth saying,until we ask: What discipline? Society is a complex thing, and any man who isclearsighted enough to see where its good lies should obviously be given powersto put his insight into action; there are too few people with that kind ofinsight. But our knowledge of modern dictators is enough to make us recoil fromthe idea of political absolutism. It is true that a country, as a whole, islikely to work better under a political dictatorship. But the men of genius arenever included in ‘the country as a whole.’ They do not fit easily into apolitical strait-jacket. And if a regime cramps its highest type of individuals,it may as well give up the ghost at once, for it cannot survive long.We can formulate this rule, then: The ideal social discipline is the one thattakes fullest account of the men of genius. When society no longer has suchdiscipline, the men of genius become Outsiders: they feel lost; they no longerseem to fit into the social body. If this rule is true, no politicaltotalitarianism can provide a lasting social discipline. It is only when asociety is half-dead that people are stupid enough to think that it can.But has there ever been a social discipline that fitted Outsiders perfectly?Yes. Historical fact leaves no doubt that the Church of the Middle Ages providedsuch a discipline. It fitted everyone in society, from the highest intellectualtypes to the meanest artisan. And this has been true of every ‘church’ inhistory—Hindu, Buddhist, Zarathustrian, Taoist, Mahometan. When these churcheswere at the height of their health and strength, there were no ‘Outsiders.’ Themen of genius were born into a thriving tradition; all of them—thinkers,painters, musicians, storytellers—created for the glory of the Church.It is not difficult for us, in the twentieth century, to see what a desirablestate of affairs this was. If we happen to have been brought up in somefree-thinking or atheistic tradition, we may be inclined to sneer at theChurch—whether in the tenth century or the twentieth. But that is only throughlack of knowledge. No serious person could possibly understand the achievementof the mediaeval Church and still feel inclined to sneer.The argument I am propounding is quite simple: Outsiders are a symptom of adying culture. Without sense of purpose, there can be no life. Society alwaysbegins to die from the head downward. First, the men of genius lose their senseof purpose. When that happens, the decline has begun.This position is anti-humanist. Humanism can be summarised in Rousseau’ssentence: ‘Man is born free, and yet is everywhere in chains.’ The whole objectof The Outsider was to prove that this is rubbish. Man is not born free; he isborn in chains that are far more degrading and demoralising than loss of socialliberty: the chains of boredom and futility. Without a discipline to give himpurpose and save him from his own aimlessness, man is nothing.But, it might be objected, man has a purpose that saves him from aimlessness: tofeed and clothe himself and his family. Precisely: most men are saved from asense of futility by mere physical demands. It is only the Outsider who resentsthis easy way of solving the problem of meaning. Eliot’s ‘Insider’ Sweeneystates:> Birth, and copulation, and death.> > That’s all the facts when you come to brass tacks:> > Birth, and copulation, and death.> > I’ve been born, and once is enough ... 1And this is true. On the physical plane, the plane of ‘brass tacks,’ life has nomeaning. But the Outsider hates mere ‘living’ on this primary level; heinfinitely prefers the ‘secondary’ plane of the imagination and the intellect.And you cannot live on that plane for more than a few hours before the problemof aim and purpose blocks the road.There is a certain type of person who likes to declare that life ismeaningless—usually as a justification for some hedonistic philosophy or justsheer empty-headedness. I have tried to argue that there is a meaning, and thatit can be discovered by rigorous analysis and a tremendous will to discovery.(Without this latter, all the scepticism in the world is barren.)What, then, is our position? Briefly summarised, it is this:Society dies from the head downward—the head being the ‘Outsiders.’ Once thehead is dead, the rest of the body has a limited life-span. And when I say that‘the head dies,’ I mean that the sense of aim and purpose is lost.But the ‘head’ can recover its sense of meaning. So it might appear that insolving the Outsider’s problem of purpose we can solve the problem of hiscivilisation as well.Unfortunately, this is not so. Before the head’s sense of purpose cancommunicate itself to the rest of the body, it needs to be expressed in a formthat the stupid body can absorb: I mean in a religion, in myths and parables andceremonies. The essence of religion is eternal, but it is only the men of geniuswho can grasp it. The religion of the majority has to be simplified and coatedwith sugar. And the forms which a religion takes can survive only for a certainlength of time. You may remember that in H. G. Wells’s The Invisible Man hishero remained invisible as long as he was naked; as soon as he put on a suit ofclothes, people could see where he was. We might liken the Outsider to a man whois so obsessed by the fact that he cannot see the Invisible Man that he developsa second sight, and can finally see him even though he remains naked. But forthe common man, the Invisible Man must be persuaded to wear a suit of clothes ifhe is going to be seen. As long as the Outsider is interested only in seeing theInvisible Man for himself, it does not matter if he remains naked. But if theOutsider wants to convince the rest of society of the Invisible Man’s existence,he has to persuade him to wear a suit of clothes. So it is that for the Outsiderwho strives hard enough a sense of meaning becomes visible in life. But if hewishes to communicate that sense of meaning to forty million of his countrymen,he must express it in ways that are easy to understand. He must simplify it, andeven, where necessary, oversimplify it.Of Christianity, the Outsider would state that every one of its doctrines hastwo meanings: the ideas of Christ the Redeemer, Heaven and Hell, Original Sin,can be understood in the obvious physical sense—the sense in which mostChristians have always understood them—and a spiritual sense, which is aselusive to the ordinary person as the Invisible Man. The obvious physical senseappears to the Outsider as no better than a fabrication of myths and fairytales; but the spiritual sense remains true.Since five of the six great religious figures we are to consider in this bookwere professed Christians, it might be instructive to examine the question: CanChristianity save our civilisation? And if not, why not?It soon becomes apparent on reading the Gospels that Jesus was of the type ofthe demagogue-artist; he had more in common with Hitler than with Ramakrishna: aman of action with a distinctly rough side to his tongue. There is no trace inthe Gospels of ‘gentle Jesus, meek and mild’ (although it would be a mistake tothink of him as always bad-tempered and impolite). He was not—like many of themen we have examined—a mixture of mystic and poet; in fact, he was not a mysticat all. He preaches in the same manner as the Hebrew prophets. He threatens withhellfire (or at least, with Gehenna, a place equivalent to our destructor ofrubbish); he adds to the demands of the Ten Commandments, strikes at sexuallooseness, and emphasises that the godly life must be a matter between a man andhimself, not a concern of other people. He goes to great lengths to emphasisethe demand for unworldliness, telling the people to think of nothing but God,and not to be anxious about the morrow. The Sermon on the Mount is a demand forasceticism and devotion to God. Jesus attacks hypocrites and worldly-wisemen,and demands a higher standard of conduct. Generally speaking, his attitude tothe world is very like Nietzsche’s—harshly critical, and based on a feeling thatmost men are only half-men, and that they ought to spend all their time becomingwhole-men.On reading the Gospels, it becomes clear that Jesus’s aim was the aim of everyprophet and artist—to make men more alive, more conscious; a desire to get morelife and more will out of a great sea of half-dead matter. He teaches that thebody is the temple of the holy spirit, and the vehicle of the expression of theGod-force. Like Kafka and T. E. Lawrence, he advocates a recognition of thedifficulty of salvation, and comes close to saying with Kafka: In the strugglebetween yourself and the world, always take the world’s side.Such men as Jesus are always regarded as a nuisance by the ‘average man,’ theworldly-wisemen who consider that they are quite good enough in their ownfashion, and resent being asked to make themselves uncomfortable. And it isperfectly true that this assertion ‘Man is the temple of the spirit,’ which isnot ‘religion’ but just common sense to the artist, is quite incomprehensible tothe average man. For the average man, the body’s demands are common sense. Therecognition of a permanent principle in man, of an element which wars to imposeits will on the body conditioned by space and time, is reserved for the few whoare awake enough to be aware that time drags the body towards unconsciousness,that ‘to be conscious is not to be in Time,’* that the aim of all religion isincreased consciousness. To devote the consciousness completely to the demandsof the moment (or of future moments) is to waste it utterly.This, then, is the essence of Christ’s teaching: it is the will of thelife-force that men should strive for more consciousness and life (or, as Jesuswould have expressed it, it is God’s will that men strive to become more likeHim). All men must be made to realise that this is the single and sole aim. Whenthey do so, they will cease to bother their heads about trivialities; they willcease to be petty and quarrelsome. Man will live in perfect fellowship with hisneighbour, because in order to achieve his real aim, he must not waste timesquabbling and bickering. Having ceased to be trivial and shortsighted, havingestablished a society on principles of communism and mutual aid, and havingoutgrown such moral cancers as jealousy and possessiveness, man’s feet are thenat the foot of the stairway leading towards the primary aim of God—more life,more vitality, greater intensity of consciousness; for all life should aspiretowards the godlike.This can hardly be claimed as an exclusively Christian ethic: it has been themessage of every great prophet and religious teacher since the world began. Inpreaching it, Jesus had not made any great departure from the message of Isaiahor Ezekiel or Micah. He had told them that ‘the kingdom of God was within them,’and that men are gods (as the Eighty-second Psalm states) and must strive to‘have life more abundantly’ by accepting greater responsibility for carrying outGod’s purpose in the world.Now, as Dostoevsky’s Grand Inquisitor was to point out, men do not want thiskind of responsibility. The men who are willing to accept such a burden arerare. It is as if an art teacher were to tell every member of his class thattheir responsibility to God was to become Rembrandts and El Grecos, and thatanyone failing to do so would be ostracised. Most people will claim that ‘theyknow their own limitations,’ although what they really mean is that they have nointention of paying the tremendous price of will power and sweat that makes agreat artist. The moral teacher who tries to persuade men to stop looking forcomfort and strive to become great is likely to find himself without anaudience.It is highly probable that this would have happened to Jesus, and that fiveyears after his death everyone would have completely forgotten him. Jesus’steachings alone would not have preserved his memory beyond the end of the yearin which he died. But there were other factors. To begin with, there were themiracles. He had some sort of strange power of healing (a power which is by nomeans as rare as we might suppose). Jesus himself never tried to use their powerto reinforce his preaching, for he realised that the reputation of amiracle-worker would not make people take him any more seriously. Shaw makesthis point brilliantly:> Jesus’s teaching has nothing to do with miracles. If his mission had been> simply to demonstrate a new method of restoring lost eye-sight, the miracle of> curing the blind would have been entirely relevant. But to say ‘You should> love your enemies; and to convince you of this I will now proceed to cure this> gentleman of a cataract’ would have been, to a man of Jesus’s intelligence,> the proposition of an idiot.2But the miracles, irrelevant or not, helped to prevent Jesus being forgotten asa hundred other prophets have been forgotten. This was partly due to anotherfactor—the ‘divine mission’ which his disciples began to claim for him after hisdeath, and towards which they were able to adduce the miracles as evidence.Finally, when the legend of Jesus began to spread throughout the Near East, itwas for reasons that had nothing whatever to do with his teachings.Dr. Schonfield has given a vivid account of the situation after thecrucifixion,* with the disciples discouraged and frightened, and the followersof Jesus breaking up and losing belief. Then the Resurrection was reported; thebody had disappeared from the tomb. People began to circulate stories aboutJesus being seen in the flesh. Jesus had prophesied the Last Judgement, and haddeclared that it would take place within the lifetime of people then alive. Hehimself would be the judge of the living and the dead. These stories caught theimagination: the appalling death on the cross, the reappearance as a living manfor a few days; the prophecy of the end of the world within the lifetime ofpeople then alive, and the Last Judgement with Jesus himself as judge.*But there was an even more important factor in this growing power ofChristianity: the conversion of a former Jew and persecutor of the Christians,St. Paul.Paul, from all the evidence, was as different from Jesus as it is possible toimagine. Jesus was a man of action, completely free from a sense of sin or anyother neuroses; a man like Isaiah and Micah, impetuous, occasionallyquick-tempered, sensitive, strong-willed, driven by a need to impress hisvitality on his age. Paul was far more the thinker; he might have been aKierkegaard—misshapen, unhealthy, intellectual, morbidly preoccupied with death,violence and pain, possessed by a sense of sin, perpetually tormented byself-criticism that could never stimulate his will to remake himself. In fact,Paul had practically nothing in common with Jesus; and neither had the religionthat Paul invented and called Christianity anything in common with the teachingsof its founder.To begin with, Paul emphasised the idea of the end of the world and the LastJudgement. This view suited his way of thinking. A modern example of Paul’s typeof temperament would be Mr. T. S. Eliot: for all the preoccupations of The WasteLand and The Hollow Men are to be found in the Pauline Epistles. For Paul, asfor Mr. Eliot, the past became a way of compensating for the present: theviolent death of Jesus, his prophecies of the Last Judgement.In saying this, I am not in any way trying to criticise Paul. To seek refuge inhis own sense of inadequacy by viewing the world pessimistically is a perfectlyvalid way for an Outsider to escape from his plight. Paul only did whatHemingway and T. E. Lawrence and Dostoevsky did: concentrated upon the idea ofpain and death and futility (which Paul called sin) until he felt he had gainedpower over them. And it was in this act that Paul conceived his greatest idea,which was to make Christianity a world religion: his idea that Christ died as auniversal scapegoat for the sins of all men. After all, if the idea of theCrucifixion had helped Paul to gain power over himself, then it is obvious that,in a sense, Jesus had died to give Paul more intense life—a deeper consciousnessof the meaning of life, a greater sense of purpose. And if Christ’s death hadsaved Paul from his own futility, why should it not do the same for all men?This was the birth of the idea of the Vicarious Atonement: that Christ died tosave men. With his Old Testament training, Paul was soon able to work this intoan intellectually formidable doctrine. At the bottom of Paul’s vision lay hisfeeling that all men are born futile and stupid. The Old Testament gave him areason for this: the disobedience of Adam (although actually, the purpose of thelegend in Genesis is only to explain why there is pain and misery in the world,not to explain why men themselves are imperfect). Paul declared: It is Adam’sfault that men are born in sin; but by turning to Christ, they can throw off alltheir sins and again become perfect.This is all very well, but it has some obvious flaws. Paul felt that all men arefutile and stupid (‘in sin’). Before his conversion, he himself seems to havebeen a rather nasty little specimen; like Dostoevsky’s beetle-man, lackingself-respect and certainty of purpose. Christ’s death and his teaching gave Paula sense of purpose and, with it, his self-respect. Paul then ceased to be abeetle-man, and entered the man-of-action stage—the Raskolnikov stage. Now forPaul, as for Jesus, the problem set by his vision of mankind was: Why are mennot more like God? His answer was: Because of Adam’s disobedience. But was itever suggested that Adam was godlike? To the Outsider, Adam’s existence in theGarden of Eden sounds rather dull—eating fruit and ‘being happy.’ The Book ofGenesis nowhere states that it was Adam’s business to use his brain in the workof helping God to create more life. And, as I have already pointed out, theOutsider’s theology includes the belief that the Fall was necessary: that manwould be little more than a vegetable if he had not ‘eaten of the tree of theknowledge of good and evil.’ So the Pauline doctrine of the Vicarious Atonementbegins to look rather thin as soon as one examines it closely. As an account ofman’s position in the world, it has the virtue of assuming that man isessentially imperfect, and that the ideal aim would be to become godlike (‘Be yeperfect as your Father in heaven is perfect’), but fails to recognise that (asJesus saw) man can become far more godlike by his own efforts than he everrealises. All the same, it is this doctrine of Paul’s that has become the centreof Christianity, and the backbone of the Church. It has also exposedChristianity to the complaint—voiced by Nietzsche—that it is a religion of lamedogs. Jesus’s doctrine is essentially a demand for discipline and strength, butPaul turned it into the religion of refuge. The strong men who have gone intothe Church—the St. Augustines, the George Foxes—have always done so for theopposite reason, because they are too strong and have nothing to do with theirstrength; they are like trees, overburdened with fruit. And this is the basis ofthe popularity of Christianity: the width of its appeal, to the weak and thestrong, the underprivileged and the overprivileged, the ‘poor in spirit’ and the‘rich in spirit.’ Nietzsche professed his respect for the founder ofChristianity and his contempt for St. Paul, calling him ‘the Jewish Pascal,’ andreferring to him as ‘superstitious and cunning ... a man greatly tormented,greatly to be pitied.’ Nietzsche’s version of the revelation on the road toDamascus is as follows:> And at last a rescuing thought, together with a vision (as was natural with an> epileptic like him) flashed upon him: to him, the fierce zealot of the law,> who, at heart, was wearied to death by it, there appeared on a lonely path> that Christ with the radiance of God on his face, and Paul heard the words:> ‘Why pursuest thou me?’ What really happened is this; his mind all at once had> become enlightened. ‘It is unreasonable’ (so he said to himself) ‘to persecute> this very Christ. Here is the way out, here perfect revenge, here ... have I> and hold I the destroyer of the law.’ The sufferer from the most anguished> pride felt suddenly restored, his moral despair was blown away, for the morals> were blown away, destroyed—that is, fulfilled, yonder on the cross!3Nietzsche’s account need not be taken merely as an attempt to debunk Paul; thereis, at the bottom of it, a poet’s perception of what went on in another poet’smind. It is not to Paul’s discredit that he was mentally sick, and found anantidote in Christianity; if it were, the same objection could be applied toNietzsche, who was sick when he was ‘waylaid’ by the idea of Zarathustra.Nietzsche only objected to the idea of the Vicarious Atonement—objected to itpassionately all his life. His own great saviour-prophet, Zarathustra, tells hisdisciples to forget him and think for themselves; he does not want disciples andfollowers, but equals. Nietzsche, himself a prophet of the first rank, felt atremendous objection to carrying the burden of his disciples’ weaknesses (forthat is what being a leader amounts to). The same is true of Christ, whodeclined to become the new Judas Maccabaeus, the leader-figurehead, and insteadtold his followers to go away and strive to be perfect as God is perfect.But the Grand Inquisitor was right. Men do not want a religion on those terms.Tell them that they are morally free, and they will shrink from the burden. Notevery man is capable of following the Outsider’s hard road to belief. Men do notwant ‘moral self-leadership’; they want ‘bread and circuses.’ The men who arecapable of carrying the burden of their own freedom are very rare. This is theobservation which led Nietzsche to the doctrine that has made him most hated—his‘Master-and-slave’ morality, which teaches that the human race is divided intomasters and slaves: the masters capable of immense will power, immensesuffering, immense self-discipline; the slaves too shortsighted to want anythingexcept material necessities and a leader to obey. And yet Nietzsche’s doctrineis no more than a flat statement of the moral hidden in Dostoevsky’s fable ofthe Grand Inquisitor. The problem we face today is still the problem that theGrand Inquisitor stated: that Christ’s teaching ‘Be your own leader’ will neversuit the majority of men. Dostoevsky might equally well have substituted theBuddha for Christ in the parable, for the same objection applies; the Buddhaalso taught that men are answerable only to themselves for their moralwell-being. He also warned men not to accept him as an oracle, but only to usehim as a guide to find their own way. Yet Buddhism became a universal religionin precisely the same way as Christianity: by the formation of legends thatchanged the Buddha into a God, supplied his mother with a divine origin, andtold of visions of angels, miracles, and a final chorus of the heavenly host toconduct him to heaven when he died. All this points to the truth of the GrandInquisitor’s argument, and to Nietzsche’s Master-and-slave doctrine.And this is the problem which now presents itself in our analysis of theOutsider. Let us summarise briefly:Christ’s teaching was the same as Nietzsche’s and the Buddha’s: Be your ownmaster; strive to be perfect. On the strength of this teaching alone, Christwould have been forgotten nineteen centuries ago. But Christ died announcing theLast Judgement, to begin almost immediately, with himself as Judge. St. Paulmade this the centre of his own version of Christianity, claiming that Christhad been sent by God to announce the end of the world, but that he had the powerof remitting the sins of all who believed in him. In other words, Christ’steaching ‘Be your own master’ went overboard; in its place, St. Paul substituteda Christ who said: ‘Regard me as your master, and I will do some specialpleading for you on Judgement Day (by virtue of a bargain I made with my Father,that I should submit to the unpleasantness of dying in order to become yourjudge and advocate).’ St. Paul’s Christ had far more qualifications forpopularity than Jesus himself ever had; and the consequence was a tremendousspread of ‘Christianity.’ After Paul, Christianity ceased to be the gospel of‘Redeem yourself’ and became the gospel of ‘Let me redeem you.’ Shaw alwaysreferred to it as ‘Crosstianity.’For a long time after Christ’s death, men waited patiently for the Day ofJudgement. When it was delayed, they assumed this was due to God’s mercy andpatience, and regarded themselves as lucky. In any case, the Last Judgement soonceased to be the centre of the Christian doctrine. Instead, Paul’s idea ofChrist as universal scapegoat took its place. The Last Judgement might bedeferred to the remote future; in the meantime, the people who had believed inChrist would wait for it in Heaven. One believed in Christ in order to get toHeaven.Undoubtedly, the Christian Church made for higher civilisation and culture.First, and most important, it provided men with a sense of spiritual purpose anddirection. It emphasised the reality of the spirit. Its authority was entirelyfor the good, for it gave even the stupidest men a sense of being a part of agreat universal scheme.Moreover, it provided a refuge for Outsiders. The Outsider, I have said, is theprophet in embryo. When a man felt a stirring of those same urges that inspiredJesus—the need to seek for ‘more abundant life’—he entered the Church, and wasable to turn his spiritual energy to good purpose. The Outsider is theanti-world man and the Church which had always declared: ‘My kingdom is not ofthis world’ was the perfect home for him.But naturally, things began to go wrong. As the Church grew stronger, it alsogrew more arrogant (Toynbee’s ‘hybris’), more authoritarian. The Outsiders beganto find it more and more intolerable. The Outsider naturally begins as ananarchist; it is not until he has begun to understand his spiritual urges thathe ceases to be destructive, and concentrates on creation. As the Church becamemore and more certain of its own power, it ceased to be so tolerant of thatearly anarchist phase in the Outsiders. In the eleventh century, a sect calledthe Paterines had objected to simony and other abuses, and the Pope had beenglad enough to make use of them in his battle to prevent priests from marrying.A mere century later, Peter Waldo was excommunicated when he objected to theabuses of the Church. The Church was no longer willing to absorb Outsiders whowould not knuckle under to its authority from the outset.Waldo is an interesting figure who really deserves a chapter to himself.* He wasa rich merchant of Lyons who suddenly sold all his goods and gave them to thepoor. He then began to wander around, preaching. One of his first activities wasto try to make the Bible accessible to ordinary working men. It was availableonly in a Latin version, and he paid for it to be translated. This immediatelymade him unpopular with the Church, which felt that its authority would beundermined. So Waldo was forbidden to preach, and, when he refused, wasexcommunicated. This did not worry him. He retaliated by answering that the trueChurch was carried in man’s heart, and did not require priests to interpret it.The Church had made a stupid move in attacking him, and not trying to assimilatehim. The attacks drove him much further than he would have gone otherwise; hefinished by declaring that the Church was totally unnecessary. His followersincreased (calling themselves the Waldenses), and a considerable anti-clericalmovement began in France. Other sects sprang up: the Albigenses, the Cathari.All of them believed that oaths are forbidden, that capital punishment shouldnot be allowed to the state, that any man is a priest if ‘the spirit moves him,’and that the Roman Church was not the true Church. The Cathari actually declaredthat the Roman Church was the ‘whore of Babylon’ spoken of in Revelation. TheChurch attempted to stamp out the heresies by appointing inquisitors, whoruthlessly burned, tortured and confiscated property. The Waldenses retreatedinto Swiss valleys, where they were less accessible, and established contactwith Swiss and German reformers.The Outsider had become the Rebel, and the Reformation had begun. Three morecenturies were to elapse before the Church received its greatest blow, from thehand of Luther, but in the meantime, it continued the same policy of oppression.John Wycliffe (1320-84), an Oxford scholar, came into conflict with the Church,and, like Waldo, refused to give way. As with Waldo, the Church drove him togreater and greater lengths of antagonism. He began by writing a pamphletaffirming that the Church ought to have no concern with temporal matters, andthat the clergy ought not to hold property. But as the Church directed blowafter blow at him, he went to greater lengths, and finished by denouncing thePope as Antichrist, and declaring that transubstantiation (the changing of thebread and wine into Christ’s body and blood) was nonsense. Like Waldo, he sentout lay preachers, and tried to make the Bible accessible to the average man.His various writings on theology had immense influence. He was lucky that theChurch of his day was divided by squabbles, and that many powerful Englishmenfelt that patriotism was at issue in the arguments between Wycliffe and Rome,and lent him their protection. Wycliffe remained free and unmolested, and diedof a stroke at the age of sixty-four.John Huss, the Bohemian reformer, was less lucky. He also began by having nointention of attacking the Church; he only called for its purification. He wasan admirer of Wycliffe and a patriot, and taught at the University of Prague.The attacks of the Church led him to take a more extreme position, and finallyhe was excommunicated. This did not make him any less popular with the commonpeople. Finally, he was lured to Constance with a promise of safe conduct. Therehe was arrested, tried and burned. His martyrdom caused tremendous anti-Catholicfeeling in Bohemia.The Church was to pay dearly for these attempts to stamp out heresy. A centuryafter the martyrdom of Huss, a young German monk named Luther attacked thecorruption of the Church. To begin with, he attacked only the abuse ofindulgences—accepting money for forgiving sins—and nailed up ninety-five thesesagainst it on the door of his church. The Pope ordered him to retract; Lutherrefused, and wrote a pamphlet called Instruction to the People denouncingvarious abuses. The Pope issued a bull of condemnation, and again called uponhim to retract. Luther was a stubborn and pugnacious man, and he now began to gomuch further than he had originally intended; he publicly burned the bull ofcondemnation. The Pope then used his last weapon—excommunication. He also calledan assembly at Worms, at which Luther was asked again whether he would recant.Luther replied that he would not do so unless they could prove to him from thescriptures that he was in the wrong. The soldiers shouted: ‘To the fire withhim!’ but Luther was under the protection of the Elector of Saxony, and wasremoved to his castle in Wartburg. The quarrel with Rome had gone on for fouryears, and a high proportion of Luther’s fellow countrymen were behind him. Henow translated the New Testament into German, and launched tracts and pamphletsfrom his castle. He later referred to the castle as his ‘Patmos.’ A year later,he returned to his own church in Wittenberg, and began the work of reformationthere. The Emperor Charles had signed an Edict at Worms, condemning Luther andall his followers. But popular feeling was by this time so strongly roused thatit was impossible to enforce the Edict. At last—after three centuries duringwhich reformers had been suppressed or martyred—the reformation became toostrong for the Church. All over Europe, the authority of Rome began to fail. InSwitzerland, Calvin established the Protestant Church in Geneva. In England,Henry VIII snapped his fingers at the Pope, and dissolved the monasteries. Thetide had turned.It is noteworthy that the Reformation was not inspired by any dislike of PaulineChristianity; it was not a revolt in favour of Christ’s exhortation to ‘Redeemyourself.’ On the contrary, Luther placed more emphasis on the idea of Christ asRedeemer than the Pope did. In his early days as a monk, Luther had beenmorbidly worried about his salvation, tormented by a fear that he was damned.His sexual urges were strong; he was—as history shows us—full of the faults ofintolerance and pride; and he was self-critical enough to feel that he wasextremely imperfect—which, in his terminology, meant damned. But one day theidea of ‘justification by faith’ came to him; that is to say, he suddenly felt:I am completely imperfect and sinful, but I believe in Christ and love him withall my heart; is not this enough to save me? He decided that it was; and‘justification by faith’ became the cornerstone of Luther’s teaching. It isopen, of course, to the objection that it throws even more emphasis on Christthan St. Paul did (Nietzsche showed considerable penetration in likening Lutherto Paul), and even less on man’s ability to redeem himself by self-discipline.Luther removed the emphasis from self-discipline and threw it back on Christ theRedeemer. This, perhaps, is the reason why Protestantism is ultimately even lesssatisfying than Catholicism. Nothing is quite so bad for a religion as a manwith an exaggerated sense of sin and a tormented conscience. Calvin—another sickman—also emphasised the idea of Christ as Redeemer. So the result of theProtestant Reformation was not a restoration of Christianity, but of Pauline‘Crosstianity.’But a new revolution was about to begin—a revolution of far greater consequencethan the Protestant Reformation. Luther, in one of his moments of asperity,commented: ‘People give ear to an upstart astrologer who strove to show that theearth revolves, and not the heavens ... ’ The upstart astrologer was Copernicus,who, in a book called On the Revolutions of Heavenly Bodies, had advanced thetheory that the earth revolves around the sun, and not vice versa. The greatfigures of the Reformation—Luther, Calvin, Melanchthon—joined with the RomanChurch in condemning Copernicus. Giordano Bruno, a Dominican friar, wasimprisoned for seven years, and burned at the stake in 1600 for supporting theCopernican theory of astronomy. Both Protestant and Catholic appealed to thesame source—the Bible—to prove that the earth was the centre of the universe,and the sun, moon and stars especially created to give it light. Galileo Galilei(1564-1642) the greatest scientist and astronomer of his age, was forced toappear before the Inquisition to withdraw his ‘heretical opinion’ that the earthrevolved around the sun, and it was only by confessing that he had been in errorthat he escaped the fate of Bruno. Campanella, another Dominican, was imprisonedfor twenty-eight years for his scientific thinking. Lucilio Vanini was burned atthe stake for the same reason. René Descartes, the founder of modern philosophyand mathematics, was about to publish a book called Le Monde, based on theCopernican system, when he heard about the condemnation of Galileo, and hastilysuppressed it. After his death, the book was placed on the Index.In spite of all this, the age of rational thinking had begun. It gathered itsstrength from the intolerance of the Church—Protestant and Catholic (and theProtestant Church could be as intolerant as the Catholic; Calvin had MichaelServetus burned for denying the Holy Trinity). Descartes was the founder ofmodern rationalism. The fundamental principle of his philosophy was totalscepticism. Descartes himself was a good Catholic, and took great care to doubthis way back to Catholicism. But later thinkers had no such prejudice, andallowed their principle of ‘doubting everything’ to mow down every sort ofbelief. By the age of Blake—a century later—scientific scepticism had become sopopular that Blake reacted against it with horror in his poetry, claiming:> If the Sun and Moon should Doubt,> > They’d immediately Go Out.4Blake found the ‘scientific way of thinking’ so abhorrent that he attackedNewton and all the scientists and philosophers of his own day. But scientificscepticism had become the predominant way of thinking, and has continued to beso ever since. Blake’s revolt against Newton and Hume was followed by that ofKierkegaard against Hegel and Kant, and that of Dostoevsky against the wholeschool of European scepticism. In our own day, Whitehead, Heidegger and Sartrehave continued the revolt on different grounds. For better or worse, we are in anew age, an age of scepticism.What I have tried to show in the course of the last ten pages is thatChristianity was not built on the sound common sense of Christ’s teaching—theteaching of an Outsider-prophet. It was built on a ‘metaphysical’ doctrineinvented by St. Paul. This became the basis of the Catholic Church and also theseed of its corruption (for it was only one step from saying that Christ couldredeem men from their sins, to saying that the Church could do so, and acceptingmoney for it). When Luther rebelled against the corruption, he promptlyreinstated the idea of Christ-as-scapegoat at the foundation of his new Church.But the scientific age was catching up on religion. In Blake’s age, there wasactually a movement among scientifically inclined people to declare thatreligion was scientific common sense, which they called ‘natural religion.’Blake attacked it throughout his life; like Yeats, he considered it as theopposite of inspiration:> ... a levelling, rancorous, rational sort of mind> > That never looked out of the eye of a saint> > Or out of drunkard’s eye ... 5And yet the ‘natural religionists’ were not so far from the truth; they wanted areligion, but didn’t want St. Paul’s mystifications.This, then, is the situation with which we are faced today: on the one hand, theChurch, still using the Vicarious Atonement as its cornerstone; on the other,the scientists and rational philosophers, very many of them men withoutimagination or inspiration. Between them stand the men who are painfully awareof not belonging to either great tradition: the Outsiders. To the Outsider, theWeltanschauung of the scientists is as absurd and over-simplified as theWeltanschauung of the Church.And now we arrive at a crucial question: Is the Outsider strong enough to createhis own tradition, his own way of thought, and to make a whole civilisationthink the same way?The Outsider’s way of thinking is called existentialism. But it might as easilybe called religion. It is a way of thought which, like the religious way,regards man as involved in the universe, not just a spectator and observer, asort of naturalist looking at the universe through a magnifying-glass andmurmuring: ‘Mmm. Most interesting.’ Existentialism states that the mostimportant fact about man is his ability to change himself. And it is just thisfact that all the scientists and social reformers have failed to realise. Theythink that the only thing that needs to be changed is man’s circumstances, hisenvironment. This will lead to progress, and man ultimately becomes perfect.The whole argument of this book and of The Outsider is directed towards showingthat this is a shallow error. The only way in which this can be done is bydirecting the searchlight into the minds of Outsiders. It must attempt to showthat the answer to the Outsider’s problems is not a simple one, such as gettinghimself psychoanalysed, or joining the Communist Party. The Outsider is a manwho struggles for power over his own complexity, over the civilisation whichconditions him and tries to distort his identity. Hesse believed that theOutsider is the highest form of life that civilisation knows—next to theprophet. Nietzsche believed that the Outsider is a halfway house to theSuperman. In Toynbee, the Outsiders are the men who solve the problems of acivilisation, and keep it alive. But while the Outsiders are a scattered andbewildered minority, without a tradition, without a philosophy, they are of nouse whatever.It is impossible to say at this point what might be the ultimate result of aconcerted effort of all ‘Outsiders.’ The problem is even more complex than Ihave been able to suggest here. If man can ‘change himself,’ he must establishcertain means to do so; he must work out a discipline. The moment we begin toconsider the great Outsiders, or the saints and mystics, we are forced torecognise that man does not know who he is. And our materialistic civilisation,which seems so certain of itself and its aims, only helps to hide man fromhimself. The moment we consider men like Rimbaud or Rilke, we are aware ofentering a deeper intensity of life, a level of life that is far more meaningfulthan the lives most of us lead. But Rilke and Rimbaud did not solve the problemsthat their deeper intensity implies—any more than Van Gogh or Nietzsche orNijinsky or George Fox solved them.In the next nine chapters, we must attempt to penetrate these problems. We mustsee if a fuller, more comprehensive answer cannot be given to the Outsider’sproblem. It is the problem of vision and intensity; the problem of how to becomea visionary.Only after considering this problem fully can we feel prepared to approach theother problem: the problem of the death of civilisation.* T. S. Eliot, Burnt Norton, Section II.* The Jew of Tarsus, a life of St. Paul.* It is interesting to compare this with the Jehovah’s Witnesses, who have alsogained a large following by prophesying a Last Judgement within the next fewyears. Their founder, ‘Pastor’ Russell, prophesied the Judgement Day for sometime early in the century; when the day passed by uneventfully, the date washastily revised, and declared to be ‘within the lifetime of people alive in1914.’* Interested readers will find an excellent chapter on him in Rufus M. Jones’sStudies in Mystical Religion."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE—JACOB BOEHMEJacob Boehme, the greatest Protestant mystic, was born in 1575—a mere decadeafter Shakespeare. His birthplace was a village near Görlitz, in German Silesia.Unlike Luther, he was the son of poor parents who could barely afford to educatehim; he certainly never had Luther’s chance of a university and monastictraining. For much of his life he had to earn his own living. Yet in spite ofthis, he was to become—by the time of his death—an important figure with aEuropean reputation.This—as we shall see—is one of the surprising things about the great mystics:they seem to thrive in spite of the current of their time. Success never comeseasily and quickly; they can never say, with Scott Fitzgerald, that they arepaid for telling people that they feel like everyone else. A man such as Blakeenjoyed scarcely any material success, yet he was indomitable. There is aboutthese men some enormous strength that does not require the acknowledgement andrecognition of the outside world. This is the sign of the true mystic.In this sense, few of the men with whom I dealt in The Outsider were truemystics. Success would almost certainly have saved the sanity of Nietzsche andVan Gogh; on the other hand, can one imagine Dostoevsky managing to keep sane ifhe had not been sustained by his first great success with Poor Folk? Nijinskymight have stayed sane if people had recognised his extraordinary spiritualqualities, and not thought of him simply as a superb dancing doll. Successruined Scott Fitzgerald, but failure would have ruined him even more quickly andcompletely. Rimbaud’s career might have been a very different affair ifrecognition had come to him when he returned to Paris after writing A Season inHell. All these men—except Fitzgerald—had some of the qualities of mystics. Yetthat final touch of strength was not given to them.Undoubtedly, it is a matter of strength. One recalls Marcel’s friend in Du Côtéde Chez Swann, who is unable to tell Marcel’s father whether or not it israining, being so absorbed in his interior world that his senses have ceased toinform him of what is happening outside. The mystic shares this attitude. It isthe same as that of Axel in Villiers de l’Isle Adam’s play: a lack of concernwith the external world.But this is only the negative aspect of the mystic. Before everything else, themystic is a ‘mental traveller’ (to use the title of Blake’s poem). Hisresearches are carried out in strange regions of the human spirit. This is themost fundamental distinction between Insider and Outsider. The Outsider—as Ihave tried to show—is the man who strives to become a mystic.In turning to the study of the mystics, we are definitely abandoning the wholeviewpoint of the Insider. So far, I have kept touch with the Insider’s point ofview, and periodically contrasted it with that of the Outsider. But now thecompromise is over. We plunge into the depths of the Outsider’s inner-world.In many ways, Boehme is the Insider’s best approach to mysticism. He is not thetype of mystic who completely abandons the material world, and speaks of a‘cloud of unknowing’ and a ‘death of the Will.’ We might make the distinctionmore apparent by referring to a modern writer with a strong tinge of Boehme’stype of mysticism—D. H. Lawrence. After a long chapter dealing with the sexualintimacy between Constance Chatterley and her game-keeper, Lawrence describesher hurrying away:> As she ran home in the twilight the world seemed a dream; the trees in the> park seemed bulging and surging at anchor on a tide, and the heave of the> slope to the house was alive.1Lawrence does not mean that Lady Chatterley was suffering from delusions, andimagining the park ‘bulging and surging at anchor.’ The sexual ecstasy hadaltered her vision of the world, but not falsified it. It had simply made heraware of a living depth of instinct in herself—an instinct capable oftransforming her, and her vision of the world.In Boehme, we find this vision quite pure, unadulterated by the frustratedromanticism that made Mr. Eliot call Lawrence a ‘heretic.’ He was singularlyfree from the confusions and blind spots which seem to diminish the force ofeven the greatest twentieth-century writers.Most of our knowledge of Boehme’s life is derived from the introduction to thefirst edition of his collected works by von Frankenberg, his close friend. Butthe information Frankenberg gives is so sparse that we finish by knowing almostas little of Boehme as we do of Shakespeare. Frankenberg records that Boehme wasa ‘dreamy type’ of lad, and that when he helped to herd the cattle, he waslikely to go off into reveries. One of the legends has it that, on one occasion,he climbed to the top of a local hill called the Landeskrone, and found a cavewith a vaulted entrance composed of four red stones. Beyond the brushwood thatblocked the cavern entrance, he saw a ‘great vessel’ filled with money. He ranaway in panic; but later, told other boys about it, and returned to the hilltopwith them. The cave had vanished—and the money with it. Frankenberg interpretsthis episode as an omen of Boehme’s ‘spiritual entrance into the hidden treasuryof divine ... wisdom.’ But this view seems a little far-fetched. The episodeproves no more than that Boehme was an exceptionally imaginative child, with hishead full of bandits and treasure-trove. He may well have invented the cave, andthen talked himself into believing in it as he repeated the story to hisfriends.Being too frail for agricultural labour, he was apprenticed by his parents to ashoemaker. Here again we have another of those equivocal legends about him. Oneday, when he was alone in the shop, a stranger came in and asked to buy a pairof shoes. Boehme did not want to sell the shoes in his master’s absence, so heasked a price which he was certain would be too high. The stranger promptly paidit, and went out with the shoes. Then, from the street, he called ‘Jacob, comeout here.’ When Boehme obeyed, the stranger looked deep into his eyes, and said,‘Jacob, you are small now, but a day will come when you will be great, and theworld will marvel at you. So be pious, fear God, reverence his commands, andespecially read the Holy Scriptures for comfort; for you will have to enduremisery and poverty and persecution.’ Again, this may or may not be an actualoccurrence; with so little evidence to go on, it would be unwise to read toomuch into it.Boehme followed the stranger’s advice, and read the scriptures (Luther hadtranslated them into German fifty years before). The scriptures were, of course,almost the only reading available to a poor shoemaker’s apprentice with a tastefor books. No doubt Boehme found his fellow apprentices as stupid and irritatingas budding men of genius are likely to find their casual associates, and foundtheir conversation and ideas of enjoyment tiresome and sordid. (One recalls theyoung George Fox in the tavern at Ather-stone: ‘And when we had drunk a glassapiece, they began to drink healths and call for more drink, agreeing togetherthat he who would not drink should pay all ... I took out a groat, and laid itdown on the table before them, and said: “If it be so, I’ll leave you.”’) Hisworkmates and his master found him equally antipathetic, and he was finallydismissed on the grounds that they didn’t want a prophet in the house! He wasthen about seventeen, and set out to wander around Germany as a travellingjourneyman. It was a time of discord and suffering for the German people, withtheir Church divided, and the princes quarrelling. In his three years ofwandering, Boehme began to form the same kind of antipathy to the establishedChurch that George Fox had. He referred to it once as ‘a spiritual whorehouse’!Finally, he returned to Görlitz, and married Katherina Kuntzschmann, thedaughter of a butcher, who seems to have made him as excellent a wife asCatherine Boucher made the English mystic Blake. She was to bear him four sons.When he was twenty-five, he had his first great experience of mystical insight.His gaze was attracted by a dark metal dish, whose polished surface reflectedthe sunlight; the brilliance of the reflection sent him into an ecstasy, and astrange sensation overpowered him; it seemed that he was looking into the heartof all nature, and could suddenly understand the world and the whole meaningbehind it. He went out into the fields, and the same vision remained with him;he felt as if he could see into the heart of the trees and the grass, as if theywere made of glass and lit from within.Now he began to discipline himself deliberately to try to restore the samevision, and he actually succeeded in brief flashes. During the next ten years,his thoughts never left the problem of that insight—the sudden view of nature asa whole, and the sensation of being able to affirm everything. Paracelsus hadtaught that the essence of things could be seen by the visionary: ‘we may lookinto Nature in the same way that the sun shines through a glass.’ It may havebeen during these ten years after his ‘vision’ that Boehme first began to readParacelsus; it is certain that the great physician and alchemist came toexercise considerable influence on Boehme’s thought.*At the end of the ten years—in 1610—came his second great vision;* a suddengrasp of all his fragmentary insights, and a view of them as a whole:> ... the Gate was opened to me, that in one quarter of an hour> > I saw and knew more than if I had been many years together at a> > University ... 2The result of this vision was an impulse to write it all down—to try to expressit all logically. He began to write in his spare time, and soon the manuscriptstarted to swell to considerable proportions. He called it Morgenröte, and itwould be too much to say that it manages to state Boehme’s vision logically.Boehme confesses:> Art has not wrote this, neither was there any time to consider how to set it> punctually down ... all was ordered according to the direction of the Spirit> ... 3Boehme can be appallingly obscure; it is frequently impossible to follow hismeaning either intellectually, or ‘intuitively.’ Let me quote a typical passage,taken at random from the Signatura Rerum:> Thus the compunction willeth upwards, and whirls crossways, and yet cannot> effect it, for the hardness, viz. the desire stays and detains it, and> therefore it stands like a triangle, and transverted orb, which (seeing it> cannot remove from the place) becomes wheeling, whence arises the mixture in> the desire, viz. the essence, or multiplicity of the desire; for the turning> makes a continual confusion and contrition, whence the anguish, viz. the pain,> the third form (or sting of sense) arises.4(It might be pertinent to add here that the Signatura Rerum is perhaps theworst—the most discouraging—work through which to approach Boehme.)Yet, in this first book (later called Aurora), Boehme’s obscurity alternateswith passages of penetrating insight expressed in clear and precise language.*And before it was finished, the book was to bring its author trouble. While hewas still writing it, the manuscript circulated among various friends andacquaintances. A nobleman, Karl von Endem, borrowed it and had several copiesmade. One of these copies fell into the hands of the Lutheran pastor of thetown, Gregorius Richter. Richter was incensed: Boehme was stating his ownopinions and interpretations of the scriptures without worrying in the leastwhom he might contradict or offend. Richter was enraged that this nobody—thisshoemaker—should declare that he was entirely independent of tradition andauthority:> Though an angel from heaven would say otherwise yet would I not believe it,> much less understand it, for I would always doubt. But when the sun goes up in> my spirit, then I am certain.5This is pure existentialism—in the sense in which I defined it in The Outsider—aflat refusal to accept anything on trust. As I shall try to show, Boehme is fullof existentialism. (This is ironical, in a way, for historians of philosophyusually declare that Boehme was the father of German Idealism—especially Hegel’svariety.)One Sunday morning, as he sat in church, Boehme was startled to hear himselfattacked by name by the pastor; it was a sermon on ‘False Prophets,’ and Richterpointed at Boehme, and poured scorn on him. Boehme, being the mild andgood-tempered man he was, approached the pastor afterwards and expressed hiswillingness to be corrected where he had gone wrong. But the pastor screamed athim ‘Get thee behind me, Satan!’ and told him he had better leave the town assoon as possible. The next day, the magistrates summoned Boehme, and ordered himto leave the town immediately. He was refused permission to see his family andled outside the walls. No doubt he spent a gloomy night meditating on thepersecution that can come to prophets of God. But the next morning, the councilchanged their minds, and let him come back. One commentator, BartholomausScultetus (himself a pupil of Paracelsus and an alchemist) declares that Boehmespent the night in jail, but was released when the town council looked into themanuscript of his book and found nothing revolutionary in it. But Richter madeit a condition of Boehme’s return that he ceased writing in the future, andBoehme made the promise.It is often suggested that Richter was getting his own back on Boehme for arebuke Boehme had levelled at him some time before; the affair was about arelative of Boehme’s whom Richter had cheated in some commercial transaction.But it is hardly necessary to look for ulterior motives behind Richter’spersecution. The book itself was sufficient provocation. In spite of itstremendous obscurity, Boehme had some pretty sharp things to say about theLutheran Church that were quite unambiguous. And he ended it by saying that ifhis religious views seemed to differ from those of Peter and Paul, it wasbecause people did not ‘lay hold of the heart of God’ before they read the NewTestament. Now this is the same sort of anarchic religion that made Peter Waldoand George Fox leave the established Church, the religion of ‘Let each man behis own conscience and his own Church,’ and it is not surprising that theguardians of the Church should find it horrifying. For it is not, and never willbe, a practical religion for every man; it can only work for unusually giftedmen. If every man tried ‘laying hold of the heart of God’ and doing what hethought God had told him to do, people with criminal inclinations would find Godadvising them to murder and rob, while people with strong sex instincts woulddiscover that God ordered them to rape and fornicate. The thugs of Indiabelieved that God had told them to kill as much as possible, while there is aninteresting case recorded of an American preacher who was ‘ordered’ by God tocut off his brother’s head in front of his congregation, and then perform themiracle of sticking it back on again; he was duly interned in an insane asylum,but his brother did not recover his head. It is understandable that the Churchshould tend to discourage ‘individual revelation’; and even more understandablein Boehme’s day, when religion was universally accepted and prophets werespringing up constantly.So Boehme had to refrain from writing for many years. He might have kept hispromise and never written another line, if he had remained an unknown shoemaker;but fortunately, he had made many influential friends with his first book, andthey never ceased to press him to break his word. Learned men, Paracelsiandoctors, noblemen who dabbled in alchemy, liberal clergymen, all came to seeBoehme and discuss his ‘visions’ with him, and to urge upon him that he wascommitting a sin against God in refusing to employ his extraordinary gifts.Luckily for us, Boehme was eventually persuaded to take this view. It took fiveyears for his friends to alter his mind; but as soon as Boehme decided to writeagain, he began to produce books like a machine. In the six years that remainedfor him to live, he produced a staggering number of works. By this time, variouswealthy friends were helping to provide for him, and he frequently stayed attheir houses. Argument with men of fine intellect refined Boehme’s own powers;it also made him aware of his lack of education, and he made tremendous effortsto pick up a knowledge of ancient languages, and to translate his own insightsinto the fashionable scientific jargon of his day (which was largely derivedfrom alchemy). The results of this were not altogether happy; if Boehme hadintended writing scientifically, like Descartes, or theologically, likeMelanchthon, he should have trained himself to it from an early age—preferablywith a university education. As it is, his writing is least convincing where heis trying to write like a savant, and most convincing where he allows his ownrough peasant voice to explain his meaning.Boehme’s insight amazed his learned friends. They soon discovered that he hadthe natural gifts of a true poet; he would startle the botanists among them bybeing able to tell them the properties of a flower merely by looking at it, ordivining the meaning of a foreign word from its sound alone. This gift of his isimportant in understanding his ‘philosophy of signatures.’ By the ‘signature’ ofa thing he meant its form and colour, through which the eye of the mystic coulddecipher its hidden properties. For Boehme, as for that great German thinker whohas most in common with him, Nietzsche, the visible world is a deliberatedeceit, hiding an internal reality which is so glorious that all men would bedrunk with ecstasy if they could see into it. This internal reality is thepurpose of the Life Force. Most of us are blinded by our moods and feelings, andhave no sense whatever of inward reality. Our reaction to things and people—agloomy day, our dislike of someone we have to work with—keeps us aware only ofthe surface of the world. But the great poet has moments in which peopledisappear as if they never had been, and his degrading membership of this clubof squabbling, stupid schoolboys called the human race suddenly vanishes,leaving him aware of his own inward reality, and the reality of the force thatdrives all things. The Life Force has its own deep inscrutable aims and methodsin this world of physical reality, but the mystic can discern its presence inthe outward form of all things, just as an expert can find a criminal’sfingerprint on every object from a glass vase to a human throat. This is whatBoehme meant by ‘signatures,’ and it is the very essence of Boehme as a mystic.It is not ordinary mysticism—the mysticism of the East, which keeps men sittingcross-legged and immobile for twenty years; it is Nature-mysticism—the typicalmysticism of the West, which sees the world transformed: ‘If the doors ofperception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.’Boehme was to live and write for only six years more after 1618, and those lastyears were made comfortable and stimulating by the friendship of the learned andthe nobility. Yet even so, Boehme managed to get into more hot water. Onceagain, though, it was hardly his own fault. A friend of his had a few of histracts printed together in a volume called The Way to Christ. It was printedwithout Boehme’s permission, and was generally well received. A copy came intoRichter’s hands, and once more he began to stir up trouble. He launched freshattacks from his pulpit, and published a polemic full of abuse, containing thewell-known gibe that Boehme’s work stinks of shoemaker’s pitch and filthyblacking. In the case of The Way to Christ, this is downright unfair (althoughit might be excusable if levelled at the Signatura Rerum, where there is anatmosphere of an alchemist’s laboratory). As originally published, the bookconsisted of three tracts, Of True Repentance, Of True Resignation, and thebeautiful Supersensual Life; it was barely a hundred pages long, and wascompletely free from obscurities. But Richter made such a fuss that theauthorities of Görlitz once again asked Boehme to leave the town. This time,Boehme was not destitute and friendless. He had good reason to be grateful toRichter, for the first ‘persecution’ had made him famous and gained him manyfriends; now the second resulted in an invitation to the Prince Elector’s courtat Dresden, where he was questioned by many eminent Lutheran theologians. Withone accord, they declared that Boehme’s doctrines were too deep for them, butthat they seemed to be genuinely religious, and had no smell of heresy. His fameand reputation were now assured. Eight months later, he was dead. He died ofgastric fever in Görlitz, in November 1624. Richter had died a few monthsearlier, but his successor disliked Boehme just as much, and feigned illnessrather than preach a funeral sermon. Finally, a man was found who was bulliedinto doing it; but he began with a bad grace: ‘I’d rather have walked twentymiles than preach this sermon.’After his death, Boehme’s fame and influence spread all over Europe; he wastranslated into many languages; societies of his admirers were formed. In duecourse, his home town erected a statue to him, and began to celebrate thecentenaries of his death. There have always been scholars and philosophers whohave studied him and spoken his name with respect. In our own day, NicholasBerdyaev, perhaps the greatest mystical philosopher of the twentieth century,acknowledged Boehme as a vital source of his thinking, and was about to write abook on Boehme when he died in 1948.There is a question that we had better face squarely at this point, before goingon to discuss Boehme’s philosophy; the question of the obscurities. Is a greatdeal of Boehme’s work simply too deep for everyone, and awaiting some giantbrain to explain its meaning, or is it just badly written?I am afraid that the answer, in all probability, is the latter. By this I do notmean that a passage like the one I quoted a few pages ago is necessarilymeaningless, but that I suspect Boehme of an element of wilful obscurity. He wasan uneducated shoemaker with the insight of a great poet, and the learned men ofhis day gasped with admiration at the quality of his intuitions. He had an agilebrain, and he clearly enjoyed juggling with ideas put to him by his friends. Hebegan to translate his own ideas into terms of the magic and alchemy which hisfriends discussed. (The most obscure paragraphs in Boehme are those in which hetalks in terms of ideas that are not really his own.) If confusion resulted,Boehme let it stand; possibly because he felt that one confusion more or lesswould be put down to the depth of his thoughts, and remain unchallenged. Infact, I strongly suspect that in Jacob Boehme, the humble mystic of Görlitz,there was an element of the urchin schoolboy getting quite a kick out of beingthe centre of attention of so many eminent men. Let anyone who finds this viewlacking in respect for Germany’s great mystic turn to the Signatura Rerum andtry interpreting its mixture of Lubets and Sulphurs and whirling centres andstrange trinities.What, then, is the reason for all this obscurity in Boehme? Is he, as manywriters have affirmed, just a crank?*For a modern reader, the most plausible answer is that Boehme was one of theearliest psychologists. He was aware of a great deal going on inside himself,and he was also aware, to some extent, of how to travel from the ordinary,everyday state of mind into the mental state of the visionary. In other words,Boehme, as much as Rimbaud, set himself to discover how one becomes a visionary.He knew that, in certain moments, he achieved a state of mind completelydifferent from his everyday state. He achieved this quite involuntarily—orperhaps I should say, by purely instinctive effort. He wanted to retrace hissteps consciously and to try to understand them, so that he could achieve thesame state—and explain to other men how to achieve it, too—by conscious effort.But there was no science of psychology in his day, and he had to invent his ownlanguage to describe what he saw. It is as if a man in the heart of some junglewere to discover a tribe with their own highly developed music, but had noknowledge of musical notation to carry his discovery back to civilisation. Hemight try to remember the music by ear—to learn to whistle it, for instance. Buthe would be more sensible if he invented a musical notation, and took down asmuch of it as possible. This, in a way, is what Boehme was doing. Threecenturies before Freud, he was inventing his own terminology.But there is one immense difference between Bochme’s ‘psychology’ and thepsychology of Freud and his disciples, and it must be emphasised here; we couldeven go as far as Gurdjieff, and say that modern man does not know whatpsychology means. The mystic’s notion of psychology begins from the question:How does one become a visionary? Psychology, in this sense, is the anatomy ofthe soul. Freud’s psychology, with its heavy emphasis on neurosis andabnormality, is at the very opposite extreme from Boehme’s, which is essentiallythe psychology of supernormal people—i.e. Outsider psychology. Boehme’s view—andthat of the ‘real psychology’ spoken of by Gurdjieff—considers that there are asmany different states of mind latent in man as there are streets in a largetown. To some extent, a man learns to make his way from one state of mind toanother; if he has had a hard day at work, he can go to see a musical show, or acrime film, and escape from the state of mind in which he left work. But thepoet is aware of the possibility of far greater releases than these crude ones;sometimes, when his imagination is fired, he strays so far from his ‘ordinarypersonality’ that he becomes a person he can hardly recognise. Now it will beremembered that this was three quarters of the problem in The Outsider: thebusiness of ‘escaping oneself.’ T. E. Lawrence wrote: ‘I did not like the“myself” I could see and hear.’ Tolstoy, in his Memoirs of a Madman, makes hismadman say: ‘ ... it is myself I am weary of and find intolerable and a torment... I cannot get away from myself.’ And almost any poet or artist knows thatstruggle to escape one’s fatigue and self-disgust. But it is not escape fromsomething; it is escape to something—to greater power and ability to act,greater self-control and self-knowledge. If the mind is a ‘town,’ the poet ormystic is the man who wants to map the town so that he can find his way aroundit easily. States of mind are subtle things that cannot be easily re-created.One thinks that one has remembered every essential about some past state ofmind, and suddenly a piece of music, or the scent of a flower, brings it back inall the poignancy of its former reality, and one realises that memory is not asaccessible as all that. As the Steppenwolf sees in his moment of vision in bedwith Maria, memory has enough accumulated material to make a man into a god—eventhe meanest and most degraded of men.This is what interests the visionary above all else: the immense area of his ownsoul, the thousands of realisations and visions that are latent in it.Having said this, we are now in a position to understand the obscurity of muchof Boehme’s work. In his day, there was no psychology; the only science was therudimentary physical science of the period. He had not even read any of theother great mystics who are also psychologists.* He felt that he was moving onto entirely new ground, almost without precedent (and indeed, he can hardly evenbe said to have had any successor until Nietzsche).As an example of what I mean by ‘psychology,’ consider this passage from theopening of Six Theosophic Points:* 1. We see ... that every life is essential, and find moreover that it is based on will; for will is the driving of the essences. 2. It is thus, as if a hidden fire lay in the will, and the will continually uplifting itself towards the fire wished to awaken and kindle it. 3. For we understand that every will without the awakening of the fiery essences is an impotency, as it were dumb without life, wherein is no feeling, understanding nor substantiality ... 4. Thus an unessential will is a dumb existence, without comprehension or life; and yet is a figure in the unfathomable eternal nothing, for it is attached to corporeal things ... 5. — 6. Thus life is the essences’ son, and will ... is the essences’ father, for no essence can arise without will.6Alter Boehme’s terms a little, and this is comprehensible enough. What has beenstated is this: Life is a fundamental issue, which cannot be further broken downor analysed, and life is based on will power. But will cannot operate withoutpurpose, and the concept of ‘purpose’ belongs essentially to the material world.Without the material world to reflect it, will is nothing at all, unmanifest. Sowill requires a purpose to manifest itself. And life is the outcome of purpose(its son). So there is a sort of vicious circle: increased purpose requiresincreased consciousness (one cannot gain more purpose by becoming lessconscious), but increased consciousness requires increased will power. Andincreased will power requires increased purpose, for without a purpose, the willis useless.Now readers of The Outsider may recollect this proposition in the discussion ofCamus’s L’Etranger. It is, in fact, a proposition of fundamental importance inexistentialism. When the existentialist says, ‘Existence comes before essence,’he means that, before one can make anything (i.e. bring it into existence) onemust have a plan of it in one’s mind; this plan is what Plato called the ‘idea’or essence of a thing. The idea of anything which one can make must precede itsexistence. But with man, this is not so. He is aware of himself as being—justbeing—before he is aware that he is being a man. If a magician changed him intoa dog while he was asleep, he would have to open his eyes before he was aware hewas a dog, but he would be aware that he existed before he opened his eyes. Yethuman beings tend to take their existence for granted, just as they take theexistence of tables and chairs for granted. They believe they are static—that‘they are what they are’—like tables and chairs. But the whole point about manis that he is not static; he has will power, and he can change himself, eitherfor good or evil.*In this form—the form that the French existentialists are inclined toemphasise—existentialism is a reaction against modern materialism. The typicalfigure of our day is the ‘self-made’ businessman. But such a man, although hemay believe that in evolving from a newspaper seller to a millionaire he hasbecome a completely different person, has not really changed himself. He hasonly changed his environment. The environmental change may be necessary (weshall return to this point in speaking of Shaw), but it is not nearly sonecessary as the spiritual alteration from a lower type of man to a higher.Existentialism throws the emphasis on this latter kind of change. It isessentially a philosophy of the will, and its central thesis is that the highestpurpose of the will is self-transformation.And by this definition, Boehme is in every way an existentialist. If anarchitect wants to improve a town, the first thing he must do is to get a map ofthe town. If a man wants to change his own soul, the first thing he must do isto get a map of his soul. This science of the soul is called psychology.And how does a man learn about his soul? By ‘self-observation’ and experiment,and by correlating what he learns scientifically. This is what Boehme attemptsto do in all his books. As we read him, we discover that many of the things hesays are not new to the student of existentialism. There is frequently aNietzschean note; what could be more Nietzschean than this?:> If thou art not a spiritual self-surmounter, then let my book alone. Don’t> meddle with it, but stick to your usual affairs.7In Zarathustra, Nietzsche had written: ‘Not the height, but the drop isterrible. That drop where the glance plunges down and the hand reaches up ... ’And in Morgenröte, Boehme writes:> Now I am climbed up and mounted so very high that I dare not look back for> fear a giddiness should take me ... When I go upward I have no giddiness at> all; but when I look back and would return, then am I giddy and afraid to> fall.8And he states in his own words Blake’s belief about ‘the doors of perception’:> If man’s eyes were but opened he should see God everywhere in his heaven; for> heaven stands in the innermost moving everywhere.9This term ‘innermost moving’ is Boehme’s term for the depths of the subconsciousmind. In other places he refers to it as ‘the mind’s third moving.’ This ‘thirdmoving’ obviously has something in common with Captain Shotover’s ‘seventhdegree of concentration’ in Heartbreak House.In common with Jesus and Shaw and the Eighty-second Psalm, Boehme recognises theinner godhead of all men:> For man is made out of all the powers of God, out of all the seven spirits of> God, as the angels also are. But now seeing he is corrupted, therefore the> divine moving does not always unfold its powers and operate in him. And though> it springs in him, and if indeed it shines, yet it is incomprehensible to the> corrupted nature.10This last comment is particularly interesting. It is the complaint of every poetand mystic who has been overwhelmed by vision; when it disappears, one’sordinary state of mind has no power to summon it back, or even to begin tounderstand it.And yet the point of the Outsider’s question: How does one become a visionary?is the belief that these moments are not beyond reconstruction andcomprehension. What is the essence of the ‘moment of vision’? It would seem tobe a sense of the multitudinousness of life, a release of energy into the brain(Nijinsky: ‘God is fire in the head’; Yeats: ‘Heaven blazing into the brain’)which revitalises all the areas of one’s memory. All sorts of other places andother times are suddenly revived. The essence of boredom and exhaustion is thenarrowing of the brain, confinement, a sense of being imprisoned in time. Thisis its opposite: a sense of the immense strangeness and greatness of life, of‘unknown modes of being.’ It is a tonic emotion that revitalises and createscourage. In which case the man intent on ‘becoming a visionary’ now has adefinite aim: to learn enough about the structure of his own brain to be capableof flooding it with energy at will.Boehme undoubtedly mastered this process, and this is what constitutes him avisionary. It will be remembered that Ramakrishna’s visions were of the samenature—ecstasy flooding the brain and producing a sense of total universalwell-being, which was often so exhausting that it knocked him unconscious. Itseems to have much in common with the moments that Dostoevsky used to experiencebefore falling into an epileptic fit. Boehme’s descriptions of how he firstattained a visionary state have a close resemblance to Ramakrishna’s;Ramakrishna had fallen into despair, and begun to doubt whether God existed atall. In a moment of despair he seized a sword to kill himself, and at thatmoment, was overwhelmed with ecstasy so that he sank unconscious. Boehme tellshow> when in this affliction and trouble I elevated my spirit (which then I> understood very little or nothing at all what it was), I earnestly raised it> up into God, as with a great storm or onset, wrapping up my whole heart and> mind, as also all my thoughts and whole will and resolution, incessantly to> wrestle with the Love and Mercy of God and not to give over unless he blessed> me, that is, unless he enlightened me with his Holy Spirit, whereby I might> understand his will and be rid of my sadness. And then the Spirit did break> through. But when in my resolved zeal I gave so hard an assault ... suddenly> my spirit did break through the gates of hell, even into the innermost moving> of the Deity, and there I was embraced in love as a bridegroom embraces his> dearly beloved bride.11 [My italics.]This passage leads into an important question which had already begun to appearin The Outsider, that of the anti-Christian element in the ‘visionary’ beliefsof Nietzsche, Rimbaud, and Shaw. How is it to be reconciled with the definitelyChristian element in such visionaries as Boehme, Pascal, Law?Partly, I believe, the answer is that there is no true contradiction, only twowidely differing approaches to the same problem. Christian mysticism lays greatemphasis on the idea of submission and humility, love and pity. Nietzsche andShaw revolted against these ideals. Nietzsche summarised his objections:> What is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will> to power, power itself.> > What is bad? Everything that is born of weakness.> > ... Pity stands opposed to the tonic emotions which heighten our vitality ...> 12But it was not ‘God’ and ‘Christianity’ that Nietzsche was attacking; it was theunreal shadows of these things that passed for reality in the Church of his day,and still pass today. What Nietzsche was interested in—and Boehme, too—wasultimate reality. In the moment of vision, the Christian God, whom Nietzschecalls ‘God of the sick, God the spider,’ is eclipsed by a vision of reality, andthe whole world is seen as physical reality, an immense manifestation of life,where ‘everything that lives is Holy.’ In his normal state of mind, man lives ina mere corner of his being. It is self-knowledge that is obliterated. His brainnarrows until his consciousness is like a dying candle. Having a ‘vision’ islike being connected with a powerhouse; floods of energy and vitality sluiceinto the brain, and the brain lights up, like a mansion in which every light inevery room has been turned on. This is the ectasy of self-knowledge. Mansuddenly understands that he is, as Boehme says ‘made of all the powers of God.’It is not original sin that keeps man unaware of his own godhood, but hisfailure to connect himself with his own powerhouse; or rather, if original sinhas a meaning, it is just this: that man is too lazy and unimaginative to strivefor a continual state of insight. Life is a war—a continual spiritual warfare—asFather Lorenzo Scupoli, a contemporary of Boehme’s, realised when he called hisgreat devotional treatise The Spiritual Combat. (The monks of Mount Athos madethis even clearer when they gave their translation of it the title UnseenWarfare.) Boehme knew this, and knew that the real enemy is the stupidity of theflesh:> The soul liveth in great danger in this world; and therefore this life is very> well called the valley of misery, full of anguish, a perpetual hurly-burly,> pulling and hauling, warring, fighting, struggling and striving.> > But the cold and half-dead body does not always understand this fight of the> soul ... It doth not understand the fight of the spirit, how the same is> sometimes down and sometimes uppermost.13 [My italics.]It is this ‘cold and half-dead body’ which must be given consciousness of the‘wars of the spirit,’ must be made to react immediately to spiritual needs. Itis a mere instrument of the spirit, and it is the spirit’s business to make itinto a delicate and sensitive instrument, not to be bullied by its laziness andsensuality.All this is very clear in Boehme’s writing, just as it is clear in Nietzsche’sand Shaw’s. (Shaw has made it quite plain—dotting all the i’s and crossing allthe t’s—in Back to Methuselah.) Yet it remains true that, in the moment ofecstasy, as one’s mistaken vision of oneself is suddenly swept away by the floodof certainty, one’s feeling is of complete humility, complete instrumentality, astrong desire not to allow any of one’s stupidities, any of the corrupt,earth-bound personality, to interfere with the cold wash of vitality. Prayer isthe natural expression of the gratitude that rises; not prayer directed atanything in particular, at any personal God. It is simply that the suddenawareness is an awareness of one’s own godhead, and therefore of kinship withGod, of a close relation with God; it is this awareness that makes prayer thespontaneous expression of the vision. The remote God the Father, whom Nietzscherailed at (quite rightly), suddenly becomes an immediately sensed God theBrother. The image of the bride and bridegroom also arises naturally, for theflood of energy is like an impregnation. It is distinctly a physical sensation,and may not only be likened to the sexual: it may actually contain a largeelement of the sexual.It is difficult to discuss these matters freely, for we are still handicapped bya lack of psychological terminology. But it is now obvious, I hope, that theneed for such a terminology is as acute today as it was in Boehme’s time.Psychology is still in as rudimentary a state. All the contributions of thepsychoanalysts have not made it easier to discuss the mystics; in fact, modernpsychology tends to regard mystics as a distinctly cranky branch of the humantree.Let me make my implications quite plain. In The Outsider I tried to show thatthe kind of person I call an ‘Outsider’ is a development of the ‘ordinary man,’for the truth is that there is no such thing as the ordinary man. It is liketalking of ‘the average healthy leper.’ If he is a leper, then he is not averageor healthy. Neither is man average or healthy. The Outsider is a man who hasrealised with horror that all men are lepers—spiritually and morally. All arecorrupt.Now I have tried to make it apparent where the road from corruption leads. TheOutsider develops, by immense spiritual effort, into the mystic. He does this byturning his life into a state of warfare, and living with the mental alertnessthat is necessary to warfare. The mystic’s view of the world is a view that seeseverything as beauty. This beauty is already beginning to be present in theOutsider’s way of viewing the world. The world may torment him, and lead him todeclare that it is a waste land or city of dreadful night (Keegan’s view), butthe very fact that his vision has intensified it with revulsion means that hesees the world as more vital. Terror is the beginning of beauty, for all criseslead to beauty. Terror is not the opposite of beauty; both beauty and terrorstand at the opposite pole from boredom and, ultimately, death. When a manbegins his unseen warfare against the world, he becomes an Outsider; if hefights long and hard enough, he develops into what men call a mystic. But thisis not an end in itself; a mystic is only a man with a higher degree ofperception and vitality.The difference between the Christian and the Nietzschean ideals—and theirultimate identity—can be seen by considering Kafka’s aphorism: ‘In the strugglebetween yourself and the world, always take the world’s side.’ This is acompletely Christian statement. It means: Where men humiliate you, allow them totrample on you; where they strike you, allow them to beat you intounconsciousness; where they constrict you, allow them to crush you. But the‘you’ of whom Kafka is speaking is not that real self seen in visions; it is thesuperficial self, the worldly personality, the ‘doors of perception’ that shutout the eternal world with their grime and stupidity and pigheadedness. Ourpsychological language knows nothing of the extent of man, and the number oflayers of his being that stretch from the material surface, whose rule isexpediency, to the ultimate depth of purposive godhead. Nietzsche was naturallyan ascetic, a man of tremendous self-discipline, who preferred to concentrate onthe positive need to strengthen one’s vitality rather than on the negativecrushing of the personality by subjecting it to indignities. And yet he wouldhave understood Kafka’s viewpoint well enough. For Nietzsche, as for all greatOutsiders, the passion for truth was a discipline—the discipline by which hebecame a visionary. (There is a revealing passage in The Antichrist in which hejeers at the freethinking of scientists and physiologists: ‘ ... they lackpassion in these matters; they do not suffer [free thinking] as their passionand martyrdom.’) The Outsider’s greatest need is to find a way in which he canbecome a visionary. The Outsider is a freethinker because the only kind ofthought worth anything is free thought. This means that he can accept nothinguntil he has proved it by his own direct insight, and that he can never acceptunprovable things, such as the Vicarious Atonement. But he approachesfreethinking with the saint’s passion to find salvation, and the fanaticism of amartyr. And the result of his free thought is a totally religiousposition—although not necessarily a Christian position.It is impossible here to examine Boehme’s theology more closely; even full-sizedvolumes on the subject are difficult reading, and it would be impossible toexplore further in such a brief exposition as this.* For readers beginning tostudy Boehme, W. Scott Palmer’s slim compilation, The Confessions of JacobBoehme (Methuen, 1954), is perhaps the best introduction. We need onlyemphasise, in retrospect, that Boehme was an existentialist in the profoundestsense. He never ceases to tell his readers that merely reading him will do themno good—they will have to go out and do. ‘You must follow the flights of mysoul, not of my pen.’ He hated abstraction and abstract philosophy as much asBlake did. Even to try to summarise his cosmogony would therefore be contrary tohis own aims; he did not want to have the essence squeezed out of him and servedup in university courses, any more than Gurdjieff did.Bishop Martensen observed that Boehme is one of the few great mystics who layemphasis on the glory of God. But he is not alone in this, for it is somethingwhich he has in common with all the Outsider mystics. In Dostoevsky, inNietzsche, in Fox, in Blake, in Traherne, it is the poet’s vision that isemphasised, not the philosopher’s, and the poet’s vision is of glory. Nietzscheasks: ‘What is happiness?’ and answers: ‘The feeling that power is growing; thatresistance is overcome.’ When the Outsider momentarily begins to win his unseenwarfare, and has that sensation of resistance overcome, his vision of the worldbecomes positive, and this positive vision is what Martensen calls ‘the glory ofGod’—a vision that finds its finest expression in the poetry of Blake, or thegreat eleventh book of the Bhagavad-Gita.This is the vision that is the beginning and the end of the Outsider’s struggle.One glimpse of it is enough to make a man into an Outsider, perpetuallydissatisfied with the ordinary world—like Yeats’s ‘Man who dreamed ofFaeryland,’ who could never again tolerate the ‘common light of day.’ Thisvision makes men into poets and romantics—but if it is strong enough, it pushesthem into being metaphysicians and Outsiders, and from there into the hard roadof spiritual discipline.* Paracelsus was the self-conferred name of Theophrastus von Hohenheim (probablyintended to mean as great as Celsus: Celsus was an early neo-Platonistphilosopher). In 1526, he had lectured on medicine at Basle university, butenemies pointed out that he had no degree, and his ‘system’ aroused greatantagonism. He died at the age of fifty-one, after falling down a steep slopeduring a drunken debauch. His medical teaching is a curious mixture of nonsenseand inspired insight.* Although Frankenberg mentions a much earlier experience when Boehme was‘translated into the Holy Sabbath ...’ and was ‘enwrapped with the divine lightfor a space of seven days.’* Morgenröte (not to be confused with Nietzsche’s book of the same title!) hasnot been reprinted for many years, but there are many extracts from it in W.Scott Palmer’s compendium, The Confessions of Jacob Boehme. This volume is oneof the best introductions, for the modern reader, to Boehme’s writings.* In 1899, Canon Bigg wrote an introduction to the Methuen edition of WilliamLaw’s Serious Call in which Boehme is violently attacked. Bigg calls him ‘afalse, or bastard, mystic,’ and refers sneeringly to him as ‘the Görlitzcobbler.’ This introduction is still included in the Methuen edition of ASerious Call, which has been reissued as recently as 1950.* St. Augustine is an outstanding example. Consider, for instance, the useWittgenstein makes of him in the opening paragraph of PhilosophicalInvestigations.* Some readers may be puzzled by the use of this word ‘theosophy,’ especially ifthey have had any dealings with the Theosophical Society, founded by MadameBlavatsky. But it should be pointed out that ‘theosophy’ in this sense means‘the philosophy of the religious life’; earlier in this chapter, I should nothave referred to Boehme’s ‘philosophy,’ which is an inaccurate term, but to‘theosophy.’ Berdyaev has an interesting chapter in Freedom and the Spiritdealing with the difference between modern Theosophy and the ancient Christianand Jewish theosophy, and insisting on the superiority of this older type.* Sartre’s play Le Diable et le Bon Dieu brings this theme out clearly; its herochanges himself from a villain into a saint, then back into a villain again. Itcould be sub-titled: A Study in Self-transformation. Wells’s History of Mr.Folly has exactly the same theme, and Mr. Polly’s ‘If you don’t like your lifeyou can change it’ is the essence of Sartre’s existentialism—if one adds: ‘Ifyou don’t like yourself, you can change yourself.’* The best accounts of Boehme in English are to be found in Howard Brinton’sMystic Will (Allen & Unwin, 1931) Rufus Jones’s Spiritual Reformers in theSixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (Macmillan, 1914) and Bishop Martensen’sBoehme (recently reissued—1949—by Rockliff). Alexander Koyre’s biography (inFrench) is perhaps the best so far."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO—NICHOLAS FERRARAt about the time when Boehme was dismissed from his apprenticeship for being a‘house-prophet,’ there was born in England a theologian whose life affords aneven better example than Boehme’s of an Outsider’s retreat from the world.Nicholas Ferrar was not a mystic, and possibly his story is out of place amongsuch men as Boehme and Swedenborg. Yet his solution is so relevant in aconsideration of the religious Outsider that it would be inexcusable not tomention it briefly.Ferrar was born into a wealthy family in 1592; his father was a prominent Londonmerchant. From an early age he showed signs of such brilliance that his familyanticipated a triumphant career for him. Both his parents were devout Anglicans,and Nicholas accepted the faith wholeheartedly; at the age of twelve, he seemsto have had some religious experience which gave him an obscure sense of beingdedicated to God. At fourteen, he went up to Clare Hall, Cambridge, andcontinued to impress all with whom he came into contact with the power of hismind. His tutor, Augustine Lindsell, who later became Bishop of Peterborough,used to say that his tutorship of Nicholas had taught him more than he hadsucceeded in teaching Nicholas. Inspector Lestrade is said to have thanked Godthat Sherlock Holmes was on the side of the law; the Bishop of Peterborough paidNicholas Ferrar the same sort of compliment:‘If he should turn heretic, he would make work for all the world, such a head,such a heart, such prevalent arguments he hath ... that I know not who would beable to grapple with him.’ But Ferrar never turned his formidable intellect andsensibility against the Church of England, and the Bishop never had reason tocomplain. Instead, Ferrar travelled widely, and then took up a position in theVirginia Company, where he used his abilities to such effect that, when theCompany was dissolved in 1623, people vied with one another in offering himappointments, ranging from a readership at Gresham’s to a high civil serviceappointment and an ambassadorship. He declined all these, and enteredParliament; but he was not long in deciding that the political life was not forhim. He was passing through the same kind of crises that affected Lawrence whenhe came back from the Peace Conference in 1922; an anti-world attitude wasdeveloping in him. He was sick of public life.In 1625, the family bought a remote and dilapidated house in Huntingdonshire. Itstood off the main road, in the middle of a field. In one corner of a fieldthere was a farm; in the other, an old church which the farmer used as a barnand pigsty. The house was called Little Gidding. The whole family assembledthere: Nicholas’s mother, who was seventy-five years old, but vigorous andhealthy, his elder brother John with his family, his sister and her large familyof sixteen, and various other people—thirty in all. Across the fields, about twomiles away, was the church of Leighton Bromswold, where George Herbert wasappointed prebendary in the same year.After Nicholas had been ordained deacon in Westminster Abbey by Bishop Laud, thefamily at Little Gidding rebuilt the church and the house, and immediately beganto live a rigorously monastic life under his spiritual direction.There were two aspects of life at Little Gidding. Part of the building wasfitted up as an almshouse, where four poor widows were permanently housed; therewas also a hospital, where Nicholas turned his medical experience to goodaccount (at one point in his career he had studied as a doctor); a large pigeonhouse was converted into a schoolroom, and three masters were permanentlymaintained by the family. Finally there was a regular free distribution of milkand gruel for the local poor. But apart from all this, the centre of the life atLittle Gidding was worship. Three times a day the family crossed the field tothe little church—at six and ten in the morning, and at four in the afternoonfor evensong. They crossed in orderly procession, the girls all wearing blackhabits and veils. Inside the church, the altar hangings and carpet, the tapestrycushions and all the other cloths had been exquisitely embroidered by the women.On Sundays, the local vicar came to the church with his congregation to take themorning service; and in the afternoon, the whole family walked over the fieldsto Steeple Gidding for evensong.In the house itself, on weekdays, a service was held regularly every hourconsisting of a hymn and a reading from the Gospels; these services—which lasteda quarter of an hour—were not attended by the whole family, but were arranged inrelays. Ferrar himself had compiled a ‘harmony’ of the Gospels—a continuousnarrative composed of all four; and this was read right through once a month andthen begun again. When King Charles I heard of it, he borrowed it, and returnedit in due course with many marginal notes written in his own hand. (This volumeis now in Harvard University library.)Nicholas also arranged night watches; from 9 p.m. until 1 a.m., the Psalter wasrecited; and at 1 a.m., Nicholas was called; he then spent the rest of the nightuntil dawn at his own meditations and devotions. He did this for two or threenights a week, and had only a minimum of sleep on these nights. In the autumn of1637, when Nicholas was forty-five, he fell ill. He seemed to know that this wasthe end, although at first the illness did not appear serious. His last weekswere spent quietly and serenely disposing his affairs and preparing for death;he died on Advent Sunday, at one in the morning—the hour at which he normallybegan his vigil.Little Gidding was to continue for the next twenty years under the guidance ofNicholas’s elder brother John. In 1642, in the shadow of the impending civilwar, the King visited the family. Four years later, he was back again—this timea fugitive from the triumphant Parliamentary forces—the ‘broken king’ of T. S.Eliot’s Little Gidding. John Ferrar entertained him, and then escorted himacross country by lantern light to the house of a Royalist at Coppingford. Threeyears later the King was executed, but Little Gidding suffered the consequencesof its loyalty long before that. Only three months after that night of March,1646, the house and church were looted by Cromwell’s soldiery, and books,tapestries and furniture burned on a bonfire.In spite of this, the Ferrars carried on the old way of life for another elevenyears, until the death of John Ferrar. Then, with no leader to hold it together,the family broke up.Today, the church of Little Gidding still stands in the corner of the field, butthere is no sign of the manor house. Outside the church door stands the plainaltar tomb of Nicholas Ferrar; there is no inscription on it, not even a name.To many modern readers, the whole way of life of the Little Gidding communitymust seem incomprehensible and repellent, and the children of the Ferrar familymartyrs to a fanatic’s desire for sanctity. Yet to many, there must be anostalgia in thinking of the serene, uncomplicated life of this family who hadwithdrawn from the world. Nicholas Ferrar had chosen one way out of theOutsider’s dilemma; he had set his own little corner of the world in order, andlived in that corner as if the rest of the world did not exist.It is true that the monastic temper is not a familiar one in the modern worldand that, although millions of people may detest the routine of modern life andwish they could escape from it, they would hardly be willing to exchange it forthe life of a monk. This is easy to understand. It is also easy to see how aLytton Strachey—or any other modern ‘debunking’ biographer—could write about thelife at Little Gidding in such a way as to make it appear grotesque and ratherridiculous. But could such a biographer, having dismissed Nicholas Ferrar asStrachey dismissed Thomas Arnold, then make constructive suggestions for solvingthe problem of a modern Nicholas Ferrar? Ferrar had the ‘anti-world’temperament—the temperament that made Yeats want to start a community of poetsin a ‘Castle on the Rock’ in Roscommon. It is, we may as well admit, a romantictemperament: but in this context, the word can be used without any suggestion ofmockery. Consider, for instance, Yeats’s own attempts to find a solution. In hisAutobiographies, he speaks of his belief that ‘whatever the great poets hadaffirmed in their finest moments was the nearest we could come to anauthoritative religion, and that their mythology, their spirits of water andwind, were but literal truth.’1 Yeats, like all Outsiders of genius, felt theneed to make a way of life out of whatever truths the Outsider can affirm asultimate. He felt that the truths by which the ‘average man’ lives arehalf-truths, accepted out of fear and laziness. In a memorable passage, he tellshow once ‘passing ... by the new Law Courts ... I grew suddenly oppressed by thegreat weight of stone, and thought, “There are miles and miles of stone andbrick all around me,” and presently added: “If John the Baptist or his like wereto come again and had his mind set upon it, he could make all these people goout into some wilderness leaving their buildings empty,” and that thought, whichdoes not seem very valuable now, so enlightened the day that it is still vividin the memory.’ 2 Why did that thought enlighten the day? Because Yeats feltthat civilised men live by watered-down standards that are built on cowardice,and that all that was needed to make them renounce their Tower of Babel was anOutsider prophet to inspire them. Lawrence had written of the Arabs that theycould always be led to the ends of the earth by the prophet of an idea. Yeatswas ‘enlightened’ by his idea because it made him certain that his hunger for amore serious level of living constituted him a poet and a higher type of humanbeing, and not a slightly mad Outsider.This is what constitutes an Outsider. He is uncomfortable in the world. To beginwith he fears that this is only because of his own inferiority as a human being.(The early heroes of Aldous Huxley afford an example of this stage: the hero ofthe long poem Soles Occidere et Redire Possunt, for instance, who is theprototype of Denis in Crome Yellow and Gumbril in Antic Hay.) Later, he decidesthat it is the world that is ‘out of joint,’ not himself. Then he ceases merelyto hate the world, and begins to condemn it. Yeats admitted: ‘In London I sawnothing good and constantly remembered that Ruskin had said to some friend of myfather’s, “As I go to my work at the British Museum I see the faces of thepeople become daily more corrupt.” I was convinced myself for a time that on thesame journey I saw but what he saw.’ 3 In the outer world, the Outsider seeschaos and corruption. In his inner world—at the times when he is most aware ofhis subjectivity—he sees order and beauty and certainty. What is more naturalthan that he should try to find a corner of the world over which he can haveabsolute control, and then organise that corner until it reflects his innerworld? This is what Yeats dreamed of when he thought of instituting a mysticalOrder in his Castle on the Rock, and ‘for ten years, my most impassioned thoughtwas a vain attempt to find philosophy and to create ritual for that order.’So it is that, for the Outsider, Nicholas Ferrar is more than a great Anglican.He is a symbol of one bold attempt at a solution of the Outsider’s problems. Wemay feel that there is much to find fault with in the Little Gidding way oflife. The objection to it is the same as the objection to Mr. Eliot’s embracingof Anglicanism: that the Outsider must not surrender his reason to some‘historical’ fact. For ultimately, history does not matter. History, as StephenDedalus says, is a nightmare; and it is a nightmare from which all humankind istrying to awake. This is the significance of the myth of the Trump of Doom, whenthe dead awaken. Ibsen was right. We are all dead, and the Last Judgement willbe the day when we dead awaken. It will be the moment when the first human beingbreaks out of the vicious circle that makes us more animal than man. In such amoment—envisioned by Blake and Nietzsche—history will end, and real time begin."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE—BLAISE PASCALBlaise Pascal is great for so many reasons that there is always an initialembarrassment in writing of him: the question of from what angle to treat him. Awriter on mathematics begins a chapter on Pascal with the statement that he isone of the greatest might-have-beens in the history of mathematics, and addsthat Pascal began to ‘die off at the top’ when he became interested in religion.A recent biographer begins his enormous study with the words: ‘Blaise Pascal wassimply one of the greatest men that have ever lived,’ and then reels off a longparagraph of his achievements in science, mathematics and theology. Otherwriters emphasise his importance as a philosopher, and his influence on WilliamJames, Bergson and the modern existentialists. T. E. Hulme wrote that heconsidered all his work as a mere preface to the reading of Pascal.But again, the simplest and most fruitful approach for our present purposes isto consider Pascal as an Outsider. He had a thoroughly scientific brain, unitedwith the profound craving for meaning and certainty that characterises allOutsiders.Pascal was born in the year before Boehme died, 1623, at Clermont. His fatherwas an important government official of Central France, whose hobbies werephysics and mathematics. Blaise had two sisters, both beautiful and talented,one older and one younger than himself.From the time of his birth, the legends about Blaise began. He became strangelysluggish, and his abdomen swelled. Local gossip suggested that a spell had beenput on him, and his father was sufficiently impressed by the rumours to summonbefore him the old woman who was supposed to be the author of the malady. Whenhe raged at her and threatened her with hanging, she confessed to having put aspell on the child, in a fit of pique. Unfortunately, it was a death spell,which could only be removed by being transferred to some other creature. EtiennePascal offered a horse, but the witch explained that a cat would serve just aswell. This was duly supplied; but on her way downstairs with it, some friarsspoke to her sharply, and the cat jumped out of the window and broke its neck.Monsieur Pascal had to supply another cat. She also required certain herbs,which had to be plucked before sunrise by a child less than seven years old.This was also done. The witch made a poultice of the leaves and applied them toBlaise’s stomach. The result was that the child appeared to die; he ceased tobreathe, and his limbs became cold. In a rage, Monsieur Pascal struck the witchto the ground, but she assured him that it would be all right. A few hourslater, Blaise began to yawn and wake up. The illness had disappeared. Not longafter, Monsieur Pascal returned from the law courts and found the baby pouringwater from one glass into another. It is not recorded what happened to thewitch, who was, apparently, an old woman who lived on the charity of MadamePascal.Blaise was never a healthy child, and his mother’s death when he was three yearsold may have affected him severely. But he showed himself so intelligent andeager for his lessons that his father was in the strange position of having toprevent his son from working too hard. This may be to some extent the cause ofhis extraordinary precocity. For instance, his father refused to allow Blaise tobegin geometry until he had mastered Latin and Greek. Blaise questioned hisfather’s friends until he had learned something of the methods and aims ofgeometry. At this point his father intervened, and asked his friends not to talkto Blaise about geometry. So Blaise began drawing charcoal diagrams on hisnursery floor, and tried to teach himself. He drew a perfectly round circle,with an equilateral triangle in it, and set out to prove that its anglesequalled 180°. His father came into the room, stood watching his son’s efforts,and then broke in and asked him what he was up to. Blaise explained his logic—alittle apprehensively—using his own terminology of ‘bars’ and ‘rounds’ for linesand circles. Gilberte Pascal—the elder sister—finished telling this story withthe assertion that from then onwards, Blaise was given full access to geometrybooks. Her further statement that Blaise rediscovered for himself the firstthirty-two propositions of Euclid must be discredited, on the grounds that thereis not enough logical dependence between them to allow the greatest mathematicalgenius in the world to ‘rediscover’ them for himself without some help. It ismore probable that Gilberte meant that Blaise had rediscovered the thirty-secondproposition, which is the famous one about the angles of a triangle equalling180°.The Pascal family bristles with legends. When Blaise was fifteen, his fatherincurred the displeasure of Richelieu over a matter of some bonds which hadceased to pay dividends, and went into hiding to avoid being thrown into theBastille. Twelve-year-old Jacqueline was showing the same precocity as her elderbrother, and was making herself known at Court as a poetess. One day,Richelieu’s niece decided to present a play for the benefit of the Cardinal, andJacqueline was asked to take part. The tragedy, Scudéry’s Love the Tyrant, madethe Cardinal scream with laughter; no doubt the sight of these piping cherubsdeclaiming about passion, poison and petrifaction affected him much as DaisyAshford’s The Young Visiters affected a later generation. Jacqueline’s fatherwas summoned from his hiding to be congratulated, and was given an importantgovernment post.At this time Pascal was working at his mathematics; his interest centred onconic sections. But his brilliance was not confined to mathematics alone. Heinvented a calculating-machine to help his father in his work—he was twenty atthe time—and flung himself into the discussions on the vacuum that were dividingthe scientists of the age. He played a leading part in conducting experiments,and collaborated with many eminent physicists and mathematicians, includingDescartes (twenty-seven years Pascal’s senior), who seems to have shown aregrettable streak of jealousy of Pascal. I cite these activities, not simply tounderline Pascal’s genius, but to give some idea of the atmosphere in which hespent his teens: continual excited speculation, and the feeling that man waslearning to discover the secrets of nature. It was, in many ways, a thoroughly‘modern’ atmosphere, full of faith in science and progress; the favouritereading of cultured people were semi-Christian stoics like Montaigne and DuVair—fashionable ‘doubters’—and Pierre Charron; the popular poet was Corneille,with his Emersonian maxims: ‘I am master of myself and of the universe.’But Pascal was not a physically healthy person; unlike Leonardo, anothermany-sided man of genius, he did not possess a powerful physique to take thestrain of his intellectual excitement. And it is possible that this explainstheir difference of temperament, and the fact that Leonardo never developed aparticularly religious temper. Pirandello has pointed out that man acceptshappiness and health unquestioningly; it is only in misery that he begins toquestion. Pascal was not a happy, single-minded scientist because his health didnot allow him a eupeptic, optimistic temperament.And when he was twenty-three, Pascal’s whole mental life was suddenlyreoriented. His father slipped on an icy road and dislocated his hip. Twobonesetters moved into the house in Rouen to keep in constant attention. Theywere named Jean and Adrien Deschamps, and both had recently been converted to adoctrine known as Jansenism. During the period which the bonesetters spent inthe house, Blaise became completely converted to this doctrine.‘Jansenism’ derives its name from Cornelius Jansen, bishop of Ypres. Somefifteen years before Pascal’s birth, Jansen and another student named Jean deHauranne, better known as Saint-Cyran, had talked together about the religiouslaxness of their age, and brooded on plans for reform. Saint-Cyran was a man ofgreat charm who later developed a compelling personal power and eloquence; hebecame father confessor to the nuns of Port Royal, a convent fourteen milessouth-west of Paris, and exercised immense influence over his charges. He andJansen had been in correspondence for many years, and Jansen had beenelaborating his beliefs in an analysis of St. Augustine, which he calledAugustinus. Jansen died in 1638—at the time when Blaise was busy with histreatise on conic sections—and his book was published—in Latin, of course—twoyears after his death. The central doctrine of the Augustinus is the doctrine ofgrace. But Jansen and Saint-Cyran saw the world from an extreme Outsider’sviewpoint, as a sloppy and irritating place full of rogues and fools. They feltas Swift felt about human nature; and on the question of salvation, they wouldhave agreed with Gurdjieff and T. E. Hulme: men are so stupid and lethargic thatno human being has ever been saved by his own efforts. With the penetration oftrue Outsiders, they realised that men have far less ‘free will’ than they liketo believe. They saw clearly what so many Outsiders have stated: that no man whohas ever lived has solved the problem of living; that all men are failures.But in that case, what about Christianity? What about Christ, who gave his wordthat the faithful should be saved? Their answer was that some of the faithfulare saved—but not by their own efforts. They are saved by the grace of God.And how does one gain this inestimable gift?One doesn’t—this was Jansen’s answer. One just has to hope. Man has so littlefree will that he can do nothing. He can only strain all his fibres to becomeworthy of grace.Blaise was immediately converted to this doctrine, which corresponded to the wayhe saw the world. He was first and foremost a psychologist—as most Outsidersare. His own insights into human nature tended to make him agree with Jansen.From the age of twenty-three, he became a fervent Jansenist.In becoming a Jansenist, Pascal became a rebel against the established Church ofhis day—like Boehme and Kierkegaard and Fox and Blake—in fact, like most otherOutsiders who embrace Christianity. For in Pascal’s time, the Church had againbecome a lax and easygoing institution, as it was when Luther had been provokedto break with it. After Luther’s time, it was the Jesuits who had done most torestore the meaning of Catholic Christianity; who had again raised standards tothe rigour demanded by the early Church Fathers. Now, in France, at the time ofthe boy king (the roi soleil succeeded to the throne at the age of five, in1643) the Jesuits were all-powerful; most families of the aristocracy had aJesuit father confessor. And naturally, the Jesuits were forced to compromise agreat deal with their aristocratic charges, for the worldlings, the wealthypoliticians, the businessmen and merchants did not want a confessor who wouldimpose a rigid moral discipline on them and refuse to wink at their minor sins.The Church was by no means in the same appalling state as in the days whenLuther was a monk; but its compromise with ‘the world’ was enough to provokesuch men as Jansen and Pascal to denounce it as utterly corrupt.Blaise’s conversion was complete and wholehearted. He studied Saint-Cyran’sSpiritual Letters, and Arnauld’s Frequent Communion, and suddenly it seemed tohim that the mystery of life had been solved: the road to God lay before him; itwas open, and all one had to do was walk. Nothing mattered except to beundivided in purpose. He converted Jacqueline, and persuaded her againstmarrying a counsellor. Together they converted their father, and his eldersister and her husband. Less creditable was Pascal’s controversy withSaint-Ange, a Capuchin friar who held that the truths of Christianity may beproved by the reason alone. Pascal arranged a meeting with the Capuchin andsubjected him to an inquisition. Saint-Ange replied good-humouredly, but hisreasonableness was not enough to sway the newly converted heresy hunter, nor twofriends who agreed with Pascal. Letters written to the Archbishop stirred up ascandal, and Saint-Ange was driven out of his benefice, and later out of a quietvillage near Paris. The young heresy hunters were well satisfied withthemselves; but after three hundred years, it is Saint-Ange who emerges from theepisode with credit, while Pascal’s admirers have to do their best to gloss itover.In the year following this unpleasant interlude, Pascal’s health collapsedentirely; he was forced to walk with the aid of crutches, and seized with crampswhich modern experts diagnose as intestinal tuberculosis. His feet were alwaysicy, and had to be warmed with cloths dipped in brandy. In spite of this, hecontinued his experiments with the vacuum. Early in the summer of 1647, Blaiseand Jacqueline moved to Paris, and together attended the service of FatherSinglin, the famous preacher who had been converted ‘by grace’ when he was ayoung draper’s assistant. Singlin’s eloquence moved them both deeply. Jacquelinedecided there and then to become a nun; but her father opposed the ideastrongly, urging her to wait at least until he was dead. She agreed to this.Blaise became more devout than ever, but could not bring himself to renouncescience for the monastic life. Besides, his father’s health was weak, and he hadno wish to hasten a complete breakdown. He took his father into the country atAuvergne for six months in 1649, and his own health improved steadily. Hisdoctors advised him to relax and lead an easy social life. For a while Pascalfollowed their advice. With his friend and admirer the Due de Roannez he beganattending social gatherings, gaming, and otherwise diverting himself. Hisintellectuality brought him much esteem and admiration in society. He fell inlove and pursued a lady whose identity is not known (it may have been the duke’ssister). Jacqueline was made miserable by this unexpected streak of‘worldliness’ in her adored brother, and prayed for his ‘conversion.’ Soon therewas more reason for friction between them; their father died in 1651, andJacqueline decided to take the veil immediately. For some reason, Blaise askedher to delay for a year, but she refused him. She could hardly realise thatBlaise was developing a deeper and wider knowledge of life and of himself, andthat all experience was invaluable to him. His father’s death caused him acutegrief, but it did not keep him away from society for long. For three years heplayed the man of the world; yet he did not abandon himself entirely topleasure, as Jacqueline was inclined to believe. Now his mind was full of theproblem of the human will and its strength. He read Montaigne and Epictetus,Charron and Descartes. It was not that he had forgotten his original conversion;only that his conversion had taught him that the aim of human life is to strivetowards the saintly or the godlike. And now all his curiosity as an Outsider wasdirected to finding shortcuts to this end. He allowed himself to become dividedagain. Sometimes he hated himself; frequently he hated his fellow men, and foundthem contemptible and trivial. Having deliberately divided himself, he nowceased to have the feeling of close contact with God, and his devotions becamemere mechanical rites. In 1654, he wrote to Jacqueline confessing that he hadreached an intellectual and spiritual impasse. He was thirty-one, and had allthe Outsider’s feeling that human life is a lukewarm half-measure.After a year of deteriorating health and spiritual uncertainty, Pascal had avision. It was on the 23rd of November, 1654. At half past ten in theevening—probably as he lay in bed—an overpowering sense of health and vitalitysuddenly swept over him, a feeling of complete and total well-being; a certaintyso sudden and complete that, when he wrote about it, he headed the page: fire.The sensation lasted for two hours, and he tried to capture it on paper. As hewrote, his feelings changed—no vision can be sustained for two hours—and hebegan to feel that he had sinned for the past few years. This is always the waywith a vision. The first sensation is of vitality that makes one affirm allexistence, and love, love of the world, of its physical reality. As thiscertainty dies away, one becomes aware of the need for discipline if it is to berecaptured, and of one’s lack of discipline in the past. Pascal’s Memorialbegins:> fire> > God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and> scholars.> > Certitude, certitude, feeling, joy, peace.> > God of Jesus Christ.and further on:> Joy, joy, joy, tears of joy.> > I have been separated from him ...> > Let me not be separated from him eternally.It ends with the lines:> Let me never be separated from him.> > He is preserved only by the ways taught in the Gospel.> > Renunciation, total and sweet.1At once, we can see that this vision has much in common with the vision ofBoehme, and with Nietzsche’s vision on the hilltop when the lightning and raingave him an exalted sense of well-being; it is an experience that can betestified to by a dozen Outsiders: Nijinsky’s ‘God is fire in the head,’ Yeats’s‘heaven blazing into the brain,’ the vision underlying Van Gogh’s Nuit Etoiléeand Rilke’s Ninth Elegy with its affirmation ‘Erde, du liebe, ich will,’ theSteppenwolf’s moment in which he could ‘affirm everything.’ Pascal called it‘inspiration,’ and so it was; a violence of pure affirmation. From that timeonward, Pascal never swerved in his intellectual certainty or in his religiousvision.His first desire was to retreat to Port Royal, and to submit his soul to thedirection of Father Singlin. But Singlin was ill, and Pascal had to contain hisimpatience. His friend the Due de Roannez returned to Paris, and wasawe-stricken by Pascal’s conversion; within a few days, he was converted too.This caused a little trouble; Roannez’s family were plotting to marry him off toa wealthy heiress of peasant origin (his lands were all mortgaged; inseventeenth-century France, a marriage of this kind was known as ‘manuring one’sland’). After his conversion, Roannez changed his mind. His family were enraged,and rightly blamed Pascal, who was staying in their house at the time. Onemorning, the wife of the concierge took a knife and went to Pascal’s room,having determined to kill him. He was out—contrary to his usual habits. When heheard of the episode, he did not return. Instead, he spent a few days in thecountry, and then moved into Port Royal.Here, the third great period of Pascal’s life begins. The man-of-the-world phasewas over. He settled down to days of quiet study of the scriptures and theChurch Fathers. He submitted himself to the rules of the house, which involvedrising at 5 a.m., fasting, and keeping vigil. But his soul was now undivided,and his health thrived on the austere routine. In the Memorial he had writtenthat the teachings of the New Testament are the only way of reaching union withGod, and now he learned the Gospels by heart. The period now beginning wasprobably the happiest of Pascal’s life. He had accepted the Nicholas Ferrarsolution of the Outsider’s problems. It suited him well. When trouble blew upfor Port Royal a few months later, he was spiritually and physically refreshed,and ready to take up the cudgels in defence of his new home.The trouble began when the Jesuits refused communion to a certain Duc deLiancourt because he was a friend of Port Royal. Arnauld of Port Royal attackedthe Jesuits, and a correspondence began on the question of divine grace. Thequestion was submitted to the Faculty of Theology for judgement, but the Jesuitshad contrived to pack the court with Jesuits and Molinists. (Molina was a Jesuitwho taught that predestination and free will are not incompatible.) Arnauld wascondemned, and his condemnation filled Port Royal with apprehension. It was onlyone stage now to pronouncing Jansenism heretical and breaking up the Port Royalcommunity.Arnauld appealed to Pascal to exercise his immense intellectual powers indefence of Port Royal, and (after some hesitation) Pascal agreed. Early in 1656,a slim pamphlet entitled Letter to a Provincial appeared on the streets ofParis, and quickly sold out. It caused a sensation. It opens in an easy,conversational style: ‘My dear Sir: Well, we were much mistaken. I learned thefacts only yesterday ... ’ The attention was immediately captured; people readon. After all, the letter continued, it is a simple matter. Arnauld has beencondemned for doubting that Jansen’s book really contained five hereticalpropositions; well surely, the commonsense thing to do is to read the book andfind out. Why don’t the censors state where the five propositions appear inJansen, and give people a chance to judge for themselves? The letter-writer thendescribes a visit to Dr. N., the anti-Jansenist theologian. Here, Pascal showsthat he had the makings of a first-class novelist. He skilfully creates thecharacter of an intellectually dishonest, dust-snuffling theologian, anddescribes his discussion with the letter-writer in detail. The writer professesto be completely bewildered by all this word-spinning, and goes off to see aMolinist theologian. And yet another Gogolian character is created in a fewstrokes. In this first Letter, Pascal poses as ‘the man in the street’ who onlywants to get to the bottom of a difficult matter. He uses the same device asmany modern journalists, although his effect is rather less nauseating.All Paris talked about the Letter, and the police tried to trace it to itssource. Five days later, another was on the streets. The police seized theprinting presses normally associated with Port Royal. Nine days later, a thirdletter was being sold publicly. It was the joke of Paris, and the enragedJesuits tried to discover who the author could be. Pascal was among thosesuspected, but his associates were too clever to let the suspicion become acertainty. Unfortunately, the letters did nothing to stay the persecution ofArnauld, and he was duly struck off the role of doctors of the Sorbonne. In thefourth Provincial Letter, Pascal drops his defence of Arnauld—which amounts tothe statement that it was not Arnauld’s ideas but just Arnauld’s existence thatwas offensive to the Jesuits—and attacks the Jesuits’ moral system. A Jesuitnamed Escobar had compiled an anthology from various Jesuit fathers; it was forthe guidance of Jesuit priests on matters of casuistry. (Casuistry is thediscussion of whether certain actions are ethical or unethical, but its aim isnot, as modern readers might suppose, ‘to make the worse appear the betterreason.’ It is simply a practical necessity for any hard-working priest.) TheJesuit Escobar was not a particularly dishonest man, but many of hispropositions looked as if they had been invented solely for the benefit ofhypocrites and the spiritually lazy: Pascal’s letter-writer has a discussionwith a Jesuit about Escobar:> ‘Tell me,’ he continued, ‘do you use much wine?’> > ‘No, Father,’ I said. ‘I can’t endure it.’> > ‘I asked you that, to inform you that you could drink it in the morning and> whenever you liked, without breaking the fast ... ’> > ‘That Escobar is a decent sort,’ said I.> > ‘Everyone is crazy about him!’ replied the Father ... 2The examples become more outrageous; Ecobar is quoted to support every sin fromsimony to murder. Pascal attacks the Jesuits for having condemned Galileo; asthe letters go on, he continually assumes new positions from which to attackthem. The Letters continued for a year, and then abruptly ceased; LetterNineteen breaks off in the middle of a sentence.There was one event that occurred during the writing of the letters which shouldbe recorded. Pascal’s ten-year-old niece Marguerite suffered from a largeswelling at the corner of her eye that discharged pus and a foul odour; overthree years, the bone structure of the nose had been affected by it. On May 24,1656, a holy relic was displayed in the monastery—a thorn that was purported tocome from Christ’s crown of thorns. Marguerite’s eye was touched with thisthorn, and within a few days, it was completely healed. The miracle restored thefaith of Port Royal; it restored Pascal’s faith in his opposition to the Church;and above all, it brought to Port Royal an odour of sanctity which disarmed manyof its enemies. The miracle was made the subject of an ecclesiastical enquiry,and a commission reported it to be genuine.The miracle of the thorn and the Provincial Letters delayed the downfall of PortRoyal, but could not avert it entirely. In 1660, the Provincial Letters wereburned at the hands of the common hangman (although the judges could not bepersuaded to give up their copies, and the hangman had to burn some other bookinstead). In 1661, Jansen’s book was condemned as being contrary to thedoctrines of St. Augustine, and the leading spirits of Port Royal were made tosign the document condemning them. Pascal was so shattered by this that he hadanother breakdown in health, from which he never recovered.But in the meantime, he had begun another great project—a project worthy of hisimmense powers. The Jesuits were not real enemies; they were only less religiousthan Pascal—which is only to say that they were not Outsiders, and werepreoccupied about the good of the majority of Insiders. But already, in Pascal’sday, the rise of science had brought a wave of humanism and atheism, whichPascal determined to attack.This project—I have no need to point out—is very close to the Outsider’s heart.All his life, Dostoevsky purposed to write an immense novel called Atheism. Whenhe was killed, T. E. Hulme was planning to write a book that would overturnhumanism from its foundations. Everything about the Outsider’s state of mind isanti-humanistic, anti-materialistic. Atheism, in the last resort, meansmaterialism. Let me, before I go on to discuss Pascal’s Pensées, try to makethis clear, for it is one of the most important points that arise in connectionwith the Outsider.This division of the world into Outsiders and Insiders is obviouslyrough-and-ready, and not intended to stand up to close analysis. It is simply aconvenient way of approaching an important subject. Outsider and Insider differin degree, not in kind. But it is also true that the difference between thecaveman and Professor Whitehead is a difference of degree; that doesn’t make itany less real and important. The Outsider is the obsessed man—obsessed with theproblem of where he is going and who he is.But man evolves by being obsessed: Mahler became a great musician by beingobsessed by music; to begin with, he was sentimental and banal. The same is trueof many men of genius. Gauguin’s painting is great, not because Gauguin is atalented painter, but because he cared so much about painting that hiscomparative lack of talent (in the sense that Ingres had talent) is unimportant.The Outsider sees this as the final difference between men. Will power andobsession are all that counts. The obsessed man is great; the satisfied man isnot. The Outsider’s natural attitude to philosophy is this: Do not ask whetherthe philosophy is true; look at the philosopher and ask whether he is great. Aman who is not obsessed cannot be great.A doubtful proposition, perhaps, and one whose dangers I shall have to point outin the chapter on Shaw. But it is undoubtedly a valid starting point for anexamination of Western civilisation.Apply this criterion to materialism and atheism. What type of man is thematerialist, generally? Sometimes, of course, a man who has been thrown into afrenzy of opposition to the religious viewpoint by some unfortunate experiencewith its representatives. (Graham Greene presents an example in his policecaptain in The Power and the Glory.) But this type of man is a rarity in themodern liberal country, no matter how common he may have been in Tsarist Russia.More commonly, the materialist is a shortsighted sceptic who has never undergoneany deep emotional or spiritual experience (they are practically the samething). He is the type of person that Blake satirises in An Island in the Moon.He is a man whose formative years were intoxicated with the idea of science,which can make man the master of the world and of himself (for of course, partof man’s slavery to himself is really slavery to his cowardice—his fear of theexternal world, which science can teach him to master). The rationalist, then,is driven by a will to power over the world; a power which he is convinced thatunending reason and logic can give him. But his defeat is the same as that ofAlexander the Great: when all the world is conquered, what then? The rationalisthas failed to recognise the most important fact about man: that reason and logicmay give man power over the outside world, but no power over himself. They canmake him into a dictator, but not into a genius.But every poet knows that a man’s real value is determined by the depth of hisemotional experience. It is those deep insights into his own being that reallygive man mastery over himself and then over the world. Any young poet knowsthis, any adolescent intoxicated by reading Shelley and Wordsworth. The manwhose mental life is restricted to meditating about logic and science is only ahalf-man, and will become mentally stunted. If he spends his time with hisattention concentrated on the natural world and its laws, he will never explorethe strange countries within himself. Blake’s finest lyric is called The MentalTraveller, and begins:> I travel’d thro’ a Land of Men> > A Land of Men and Women too,> > And heard and saw such dreadful things> > As cold Earth wanderers never knew.3Blake disliked Newton for being a mere ‘cold Earth wanderer.’ ‘The further onetravels, the less one knows,’ states the Tao Te Ching. In the course of thislong exploration of the Outsider, I have tried to show that man’s evolutionlies, not in science, but in knowing more of himself.This does not mean that science is useless. On the contrary, it is the greatestinstrument man could have developed for his evolution. Science means theconquering, compressing and ordering of knowledge. All that must be emphasisedis that natural knowledge—the sort of knowledge with which physics andmathematics are concerned—is only a fraction of real knowledge.All man’s experience is emotional experience. Even the mathematician, plunged inhis calculations, is undergoing emotional experience. His intellectual activityis accompanied by a pleasure and an excitement that is emotional, and it is thisthat makes him pursue mathematics. An electronic brain takes no pleasure in itscalculating. All life is continual emotional experience.It is also true that ‘wisdom’ (i.e. maturity) is an increasing control of one’semotional experience; an ability to cut out certain distracting types ofexperience so as to be better able to concentrate on others. Many emotionalexperiences are just repetitive, and teach us nothing new: jealousy, irritation,fear. The more mature the man, the easier he finds it to combat theseexperiences.The other experiences—the more important experiences—must then occupy all theattention. Each strong emotion reveals a new area of man’s being. For instance,Yeats and Rupert Brooke knew that a man can be introduced to himself in a momentof anger and courage:> Know that when all words are said> > And a man is fighting mad,> > Something drops from eyes long blind,> > He completes his partial mind,> > For an instant stands at ease,> > Laughs aloud, his heart at peace.*But freed from the bondage of the trivial and the immediate, man plunges into aworld of new sensations and new self-discovery. This is the real meaning of theword education; the profoundest of all senses, in which Goethe uses it inWilhelm Meister. Real education means existentialism, and existentialism meansexploring one’s inner world scientifically. This is why materialism and all itsincarnations—Marxism, logical positivism, and the smirking Bertrand Russell typeof rationalism—are so deadly. They make imprisonment in time, consciousness andpersonality—to which human beings are only too prone—seem quite natural andinevitable. And since this way of thought has become the prevalent way in ourmodern world, the Outsider must raise the banner of a new existentialism, andmake war on civilised modes of thought.It is this materialism which Pascal wanted to fight in his Apology forChristianity. He begins his argument from the same position that I began TheOutsider: with the man who is obsessed by the search for truth. He writes: ‘Ican approve only those who search groaning,’ anticipating Nietzsche, who was towrite: ‘I love only what a man has written with his blood.’Pascal never finished his Apology, and its fragments—some nine hundred of themranging from unfinished sentences to small essays—have never been arranged insatisfactory order. I do not intend to undertake a lengthy analysis of them;this is unnecessary. Most of what Pascal has to say about human nature has beensaid by the various Outsiders I have examined in these two volumes. There is theemphasis on human stupidity to be found in Nietzsche or Swift.There is the distinction between the mathematical and the intuitive mind whichis essentially the starting point of ‘the attempt to gain control’—thedifference between T. E. Lawrence and Van Gogh. The relativity of all humanjudgements is emphasised: ‘All the false beauties we blame in Cicero have theiradmirers, and in great number.’ Like Yeats and Nietzsche, he is aware that thepoet and artist cannot be absolutists about truth, for chaos is usually morefruitful for the creator than order. Where Yeats had written ‘What theme hadHomer but original sin?’ Pascal says laconically: ‘A poet and not an honestman.’In a summary of his plan for the Apology, Pascal wrote:> First Part: Misery of man without God.> > Second Part: Happiness of man with God.> > Or: First Part: That Nature is corrupt. Proved by nature itself.> > Second Part: That there is a Redeemer. Proved by Scripture.4We can see that this First Part covers the same ground as the existentialistOutsiders, from Sartre’s Roquentin to Dostoevsky’s Ivan Karamazov. It is themisery of the total sceptic—and not only his misery, but his terror. Once he hasdismissed as unproved the notion that the universe has any total meaning, thatlife in itself is good, he finds himself facing ‘the horror’ of which Conradwrote in Heart of Darkness and Andreyev in Lazarus: that life may not be aprogress towards anything good, but an escape from something evil which waits onthe other side of physical reality. It is Dostoevsky’s speculation that eternitymay be a corner of a dusty room covered with cobwebs—or that perhaps eternity isa spider. In a famous passage, Pascal speaks of the vastness of space, and thenof the wonders of the world of minute organisms, and contrasts man, the‘thinking reed,’ with the multiplicity of nature. Elsewhere, he speaks of man’sneed for constant diversion, his perpetual misery unless he is up and doing(which we have already seen emphasised by Strowde in The Secret Life and byGurdjieff). He comes very close to saying with Gurdjieff, that man is a meremachine, completely at the mercy of his environment; that he has no free willwhatever. But unlike Gurdjieff, he does not then go on to consider the questionof how man might learn to create free will for himself, how he might cease to bea mere leaf, tossed about on the current of his environment.But the second part of Pascal’s argument is open to more doubt. A thing can onlybe ‘proved’ by referring it to something that is unquestionable, and showingthat it is in agreement. By the Outsider’s standards, it is no proof to refer tothe scriptures. And this, perhaps, is the chief weakness of the Pensées from thepoint of view of the Outsider. Pascal simply tears away the veils from theworld, and shows human nature in all its vagueness and laziness and lack ofpurpose—and he rightly calls this ‘misery.’ (Kierkegaard would later call itAnguish.) Having made human weakness so clear that it is self-evident andrequires no further proof, Pascal then takes the next step and posits the needfor a redeemer. Like St. Paul, he has rejected the imperfection of the world,and immediately created the need for redemption.And we are back again at the most fundamental of human problems. The Outsiderhas accepted the existence of God—that is, of a force working through humanbeings and through nature, of a purpose greater than the purpose of anyindividual conscious human personality. A little discipline of poetic insight, alittle ‘mental travelling’ can reveal the existence of levels of purpose thatare deeper than our knowledge of ourselves. But the Outsider feels thatevolution—man’s spiritual progress—depends upon a deepening of this insight, andconstant discipline of intuition. What has this to do with accepting ahistorical saviour?On the other hand, how is this belief to be turned into a religion which can begenerally accepted? The Outsider is a sort of spiritual graduate who can betrusted to pursue his own researches; but the average man needs a nurserydiscipline, and a nursery simplification of his problems. In fact—and this, wemust agree, sounds most cynical and blasphemous of all—the average man needs tobelieve in a saviour as a child needs to believe in Santa Claus, and he must beassured of the existence of a saviour as the child must be assured of theexistence of Santa Claus. The alternative will be a terrible impoverishment ofhis emotional life. A child has to be educated, and he cannot be educated byworking on the assumption that he is an adult. The problem we are facing is, infact, a problem of education. Existentialism means the ability to grasp themeaning of life. The Outsider is a graduate of the school; his knowledge of lifeis more complex than the average man’s, just as Einstein’s knowledge ofmathematics is more complex than a schoolboy’s.Obviously, the notion of evolution is fundamental in this scheme. Not ‘naturalselection’—which means mechanical evolution—but the slow struggle of will tomaster life’s complexities. This also means that Nietzsche’s concept of theSuperman has some relevance, even if we dare not yet formulate that relevancefor fear of oversimplifying. One might even allow speculation to roam further,and think of the Outsider as occupying a position midway between man andsuperman, or at least between man as he exists at present, and some type of manwith one degree more moral consciousness. The danger to be avoided, of course,is talking vaguely about ‘the Life Force’ as if it were some strange entity likethe Iron Curtain. If existentialism has any meaning, it is expressed in theassertion: ‘I am the Life Force,’ or in Nijinsky’s ‘I am God.’ It implies thenecessity of immediate action—or at least, of immediate realisation ofinvolvement—a complete abandonment of the attitude of being the uninvolvedspectator (the philosopher’s attitude), or the more human attitude of ‘takinglife as it comes,’ which really means allowing life to take you where it wants,and drifting aimlessly.These observations—which, no doubt, have the appearance of being an alternativesecond part of the Pensées—are not intended as a dismissal of Pascal’s theory ofredemption. Insight into the human situation will never cease to be valid—untilhuman beings transcend their situation and make it redundant—and Pascal’sPensées can no more be discredited than Dante’s Commedia or Paradise Lost. As anattempt to solve the Outsider’s problems, they are self-complete and beyondcriticism. I have only tried to point out that, under the premises we havedeveloped in studying the Outsider, Pascal’s Pauline solution cannot passmuster. It may have been valid for Pascal and for his contemporaries, but forcivilisation in the mid-twentieth century it does not fit the facts. What are‘the facts’? A highly technical civilisation with a three-century tradition offreethinking behind it, and more leisure than it knows what to do with. Andperhaps Pascal would not have expected it to fit the facts. The groundwork ofthe Pensées is essentially pessimistic. Like Pareto, Pascal would haveconsidered Marxist ideology sentimental and shortsighted. In his day there was aChurch; in our own—as Mann observed—human destiny presents itself in politicalterms. In solving our modern problems, the Pensées will take us so far and nofurther. What is important—what cannot be overemphasised—is that in anycivilisation that has reached our stage, political thinking must begin with theassumptions of Pascal’s Pensées—with the Outsider.An error must have time to grow and develop all its tendencies before it can bekilled. Pascal came too soon; so did Blake, whose fragmentary Pensées begin withhis pamphlet Against the Deists. The time had begun to be ripe when Hulmepointed out that romanticism is religion turning rotten. Now the error hasdeveloped to the full, but most of us are too closely involved in it to see it;only a few farsighted historians have recognised our true situation.Pascal died in 1662, at the age of thirty-nine. His attempt to demolish thefoundations of atheism was never completed; and it is doubtful whether it wouldhave made any great impression on its age even if it had been; no doubt it wouldhave become a classic, like Fenelon’s Existence of God or Butler’s Analogy, andmade no impression whatever on the living thought of its time. Science was tooyoung. It is true that Pascal himself was a scientist; so was Bishop Berkeley,who wrote a treatise on mathematics to refute a mathematician who claimed thatno man could believe in both God and mathematics. There is a law of historywhich could be called the Law of Errors, and it is this: An error is unkillableuntil it has stopped growing (unless it is uprooted by the doubtful method offire and sword). In Pascal’s time, materialism was still young.Pascal is, perhaps, the most important ‘Outsider’ we have considered so far inthis study; more important even than Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, for they wereboth simply artists. Pascal was a scientist and a mathematician. Many Outsidertemperaments loathe mathematics—Dostoevsky and Ramakrishna did, for instance—anda modern materialist thinker is inclined to explain the difference between thereligious and the materialist temper as being merely the difference betweensuperstition and logic. A figure like Pascal decisively disproves this. In allthings he excelled. He had the practical ability of a statesman; he had a geniusfor friendship; his mathematics and physics show the mental power of a Newton;his Provincial Letters show the satirical talent of a Gogol or Fielding; hisPensées show an insight into the human heart that only Dostoevsky can equal, andan iconoclasm as deadly as Nietzsche’s. It is difficult, in our age ofdilettantism and specialisation, to comprehend his greatness; and impossible topass judgement on it.* Yeats, ‘Under Ben Bulben.’ In his sonnet ‘Peace’ Rupert Brooke thanks God forthe war that has—> ... caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,> > With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,> > To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR—EMANUEL SWEDENBORGIn spite of the immense differences between them, there is a curious similaritybetween Blaise Pascal and Emanuel Swedenborg. Swedenborg was also a man ofscientific genius who is known to posterity by his religious genius. ButSwedenborg lived more than twice as long as Pascal, and his mark on history isgreater, for there exists all over the world today a considerable andflourishing church that preaches his doctrines. For a twentieth-century reader,this is enough to attach a somewhat doubtful odour to his name. We have had toomuch of cranky messiahs—Mary Baker Eddy, ‘Pastor’ Russell (of the Jehovah’sWitnesses), Madame Blavatsky—yet the truth is that Swedenborg is a far greaterfigure than any of these. He also poses a perplexing and unsolved problem. Untilhe was almost sixty, Swedenborg was a scientist and mathematician; and when, atthe end of the last century, his scientific writings were examined, it was foundthat he had been ahead of his time in almost every major department ofscientific activity. His work on the brain anticipated modern physiology; hiswork on palaeontology anticipated later Swedish geology; he advanced the nebularhypothesis of the formation of the planets long before Kant or Laplace; hismagnetic theory has much in common with Clerk Maxwell’s; he was the first to tryto create a science of crystals; he produced one of the earliest accounts of thephenomena of phosphorescence, was the first to use mercury in an air pump, andinvented a method of determining longitude at sea by observation of the moonamong the stars. As indubitably as Newton or Einstein, he had scientific genius.At the age of sixty, he began to study the Bible, and to write theologicalworks. Very soon, he was claiming, in his calm and matter-of-fact way, that hehad been allowed to make a tour of heaven and hell, and had conversed withangels and spirits of the dead.Before we hastily dismiss this as senile self-deceit, let us glance at the threebest-known cases of Swedenborg’s unusual powers. First, there is the case of theQueen of Sweden. Count Höpken, a contemporary, describes it:> Swedenborg was one day at a court reception. Her Majesty asked him about> different things in the other life, and lastly, whether he had seen or talked> with her brother, the Prince Royal of Prussia, He answered No. Her Majesty> then requested him to ask after him, and give him her greeting, which> Swedenborg promised to do. I doubt whether the Queen meant this seriously. At> the next reception, Swedenborg again appeared at court; and while the Queen> was ... surrounded by her ladies of honour, he came boldly in and approached> her Majesty ... Swedenborg not only greeted her from her brother, but also> gave her his apologies for not having answered her last letter; he also wished> to do so now through Swedenborg; which he accordingly did. The Queen was> greatly overcome, and said: ‘No one but God knows this secret.’1This episode is well authenticated; it is said that for days afterwards,carriages rolled up to Swedenborg’s front door, and nobles tried to persuade himto tell them what he had told the Queen that had affected her so greatly;Swedenborg, of course, refused. Many versions of the story became current at thetime.The second unusual occurrence is known generally as ‘the Stockholm fire.’ InGothenburg one evening, as Swedenborg was about to sit down to dinner, hesuddenly turned pale, and went outside. When he returned, he told the companythat a great fire had broken out in Stockholm, and that his own house was indanger. Stockholm was 300 miles away. For two hours, Swedenborg walked up anddown anxiously; then, at about eight o’clock, he said suddenly: ‘Thank heavens,the fire is under control; it had almost reached my doorstep.’ The news spreadthroughout Gothenburg, and the next day Swedenborg was summoned before thegovernor to describe the fire. It was not until the following day that a letterarrived from Stockholm confirming all that Swedenborg had said, down to the lastdetail.The third case has something of the air of a detective story. Madame Marteville,the widow of the Dutch Ambassador in Stockholm, received a large bill from agoldsmith named Croon; it was for a silver tea service which she was convincedher husband had paid for. However, she could not find the receipt. Swedenborgwas called in as a last resort, and asked to question the deceased husband nexttime he happened to meet him in the spirit world. A few days later, he came tothe house when Madame Marteville had a company of friends with her. ‘Iquestioned your husband. He confirmed that he paid for the tea service, and saysthat the receipt is in the bureau upstairs.’ ‘Impossible,’ the lady answered.‘I’ve turned everything out of it.’ Swedenborg then explained that there was asecret compartment behind the left-hand drawer of the bureau, which could be gotat by pulling out the drawer and sliding a board aside. It also contained,Swedenborg explained, certain Dutch business letters. The whole company troopedupstairs. Swedenborg could hardly have asked for a better effect—and a search ofthe bureau revealed the receipt and letters just as Swedenborg had describedthem.It should be added immediately that Swedenborg attached no importance whateverto these incidents. He seems to have had the same ironic attitude towards themthat Jesus had towards the miracles; they were irrelevant and likely to get himthe reputation of a charlatan.Swedenborg was born nearly a quarter of a century after Pascal’s death, in 1688.His father’s name was Swedberg, and he was a bishop of the Lutheran Church.(Swedenborg was given a patent of nobility by Queen Ulrica which authorised himto insert the extra syllable in his name; it is equivalent to the German ‘von.’)Strangely enough, his maternal grandfather was called Behm, a variant ofBoehme.* Swedenborg passed through the usual tutelage and university traininguntil he was twenty-one; little is known about his youth. He was known to hisfamily as a poet, but his mind seems to have been as curious and as omnivorousas Leonardo’s, and his interest in physics, geology, biology and mathematics wasas great as his interest in literature. When he set out on his travels, at theage of twenty-two, he made a summary of the mathematical discoveries of theprevious two centuries, to which he intended to add anything new that he mightfind on his travels. In London, he made a point of lodging with men of differenttrades—a watchmaker, a cabinetmaker, a mathematical-instrument maker—andlearning all he could from his landlords. He also studied music, and learned toplay the organ well enough to replace the organist in his local church. In 1710,he published his first book—a collection of poems in Latin. The next few yearswere a period of frustration for him; Sweden was a cautious, conservativenation, and young Swedenborg’s many ideas for his country’s scientificadvancement were thwarted. He began a scientific journal to record thediscoveries of his day, and dedicated it to the king. With his brother-in-law,he planned a great astronomical observatory. He spent another year at theUniversity to study engineering. Finally, when he was twenty-eight, he was giventhe appointment of Assessor to the Swedish Board of Mines. To begin with, therewas no salary attached to this post, but it fascinated Swedenborg’s practicalmind; so much so that he turned down a professorship of Astronomy at theUniversity, and, a few years later, a professorship of mathematics. This latterhe refused on the interesting ground that he thought mathematicians should notconfine themselves to mere theory. All his life he was sturdily practical, andhad no use for theory divorced from practice; this was as much thecharacteristic of his religious as of his scientific teaching. For him, thoughtwas essentially the prelude to action; there was no such thing as abstractthought. His capacity was formidably demonstrated in 1718, when Charles XII waslaying siege to the Danes in the fortress of Fredrikshald; he was given the taskof transporting five ships across fifteen miles of country. The feat took sevenweeks, but it was accomplished, under Swedenborg’s direction.Swedenborg was also closely involved in the construction of the great docks atKarlskrona, and in the scheme for connecting the North Sea with the Baltic bycanal (this was left unfinished when Charles was killed by a bullet in thecampaign of 1718).There is no point in following Swedenborg’s quarter of a century as assessor indetail; it is enough to say that he gradually made himself invaluable to theBoard of Mines, and helped to revolutionise mining in Sweden. He started towrite an immense work on science, which began with a whole volume on the originsof the universe, and others on the practice of smelting iron and steel, copperand brass. His work on physiology—especially the function of the brain—advancedmany views that were heterodox in his own day, but have since been provedcorrect: for instance, that the activity of the brain is synchronous withbreathing, not with the beats of the heart or the motion of the blood.Equally important, in periods of long, intense concentration, Swedenborgdisciplined his body to make its presence almost imperceptible. He learned towork for long hours without mental fatigue, and his concentration was so greatthat at times his breathing seemed to stop. This, it may well be, was the reallydecisive factor in turning Swedenborg the engineer into Swedenborg the mystic.The variety and number of his works are bewildering: treatises on algebra (thefirst in Swedish), on economics, on salt mining, on the tides, on astronomy, onminerals, on anatomy and physiology. In France in 1736 he predicted therevolution of 1789. Early in the seventeen-forties, his first work on theologybegan to take shape, the Hieroglyphic Key to Natural and Spiritual Mysteries, inwhich he advances a theory that seems to have much in common with Boehme’s‘signatures,’ although it appears that he had never read Boehme.The year 1744 was the turning point in Swedenborg’s life. In April of that yearhe seems to have had some kind of vision; having retired to bed at ten o’clock,he heard a roaring noise like a high wind; when he jumped out of bed in alarm,the wind seemed to pick him up and fling him on his face, and he felt thepresence of something ‘indescribably holy.’ He fell on his knees and, addressingJesus, began to pray for grace. Suddenly he felt a hand seize his own; uponopening his eyes, he claims, he saw Jesus face to face.Jesus then asked him the rather curious question as to whether he had a ‘bill ofhealth’ (a document certifying the health of a ship’s crew before it leavesport). Swedenborg answered in the affirmative, and the vision replied: ‘Wellthen, do.’ At this, Swedenborg woke up. This dream seems to have completelyaltered his mental life, giving him a sense of close contact with unseen powers.No doubt as a consequence of this new attitude, he began to have ecstatictrances, of the same type as Sri Ramakrishna’s. In London, later that year, hewas robbed of his gold watch while in a state of trance, and the thieves (whowere employed in the house), when he approached them, tried to persuade him thathe had thrown the watch out of the window in his ecstasy. He was unconvinced,but did not attempt to prosecute them.One sign of his new attitude was his sudden loss of sexual desire. All hisemotional energy was taken up by the visions and ecstasies, which became moreand more frequent. He now no longer had to sleep to see visions; angels in theform of men appeared to him when he went into a state of meditation, and once avoice told him sharply to hold his tongue; he was writing, not talking, at thetime, so possibly the spirit was irritated that Swedenborg’s receptivity wasbeing interfered with by his scientific labours. If this is so, it enforces thepoint that Swedenborg’s visions and voices took place inside his head—in hisimagination. But this is not to say that they were just self-deceptions; Shaw’sSaint Joan commented that all visions come through the imagination, andcertainly anyone who has had much experience of imaginative creation knows thatthe imagination’s power lies in its receptivity, not in any power to ‘invent.’In 1747, Swedenborg resigned from the Board of Mines; he was fifty-nine at thetime. For another quarter of a century he wrote the immense theological worksupon which his living influence rests. The works were all published in Latin,and many were anonymous. Naturally, they caused no great sensation; in fact, itis recorded that only four copies of the first volume were sold in two months.But over the years, Swedenborg’s reputation grew, and the established Churchbegan to show its hostility to him. A Swedish bishop declared his work ‘full ofintolerable ... errors’ and heretical, but the royal protection did not fail,and Swedenborg was never actively persecuted.His first religious work was published two years after resigning from the Boardof Mines; it was the first volume of the Arcana Coelestia, an examination of theBook of Genesis (like Boehme’s Mysterium Magnum). In it, he makes no bones aboutstating that he has been permitted to enter the spirit world and speak withangels and the spirits of the dead. This work extended to eight bulky volumesbefore it was finished. His next work, entitled The Last Judgement, waspublished in 1758, and maintained the startling thesis that the Last Judgementhad taken place in the previous year—in the spirit world, of course—and thatfrom then on, spirits would be judged immediately on reaching heaven. Thereason, apparently, was that the evil spirits in the other-world had swelled tosuch immense numbers that their baleful influence was becoming dangerous for theearth. (It is interesting to note that the Jehovah’s Witnesses hold the samekind of belief—that the kingdom of the devil came to an end in 1914, and thatnow—in the spirit world—Christ is king.) In Heaven and Its Wonders and Hell—hismost immediately attractive work—he speaks of having been allowed to tour bothregions, and even ventures upon some physical descriptions of them. Forinstance, some hells appear as holes or caves in rocks; others look like ruinedcities, with streets and brothels: ‘in the streets and lanes are robberies andplunderings’; others look like rude cottages. But the greater part of Heaven andHell is taken up with analysis of the state of blessedness and damnation, and inmany parts Swedenborg asserts that hell is a mental state, not a place.This is the puzzle of Swedenborg’s work; and so far, no one has been able tosolve it finally. The great bulk of it consists of profound psychologicalobservations in which the Outsider can discover his own insights reflected; theremainder describes conversations with angels, and details the spiritual stateof man after death, and so forth. Obviously, this cannot be considered as‘truth’ in the same sense as the psychology. For the existentialist, truth issubjectivity; external events are neither true nor untrue, but unimportant.The basis of Swedenborgianism, of course, is the assertion that the ‘spiritworld’ is the place to which men go as soon as they die. For the Outsider, thismay be true or untrue, but it is completely irrelevant to the Outsider’sproblems. Wittgenstein summarised the Outsider’s position at the end of hisTractatus, where he said: ‘The meaning of life must lie outside life.’ Thismeans that there is no point whatever in deciding that the meaning of this‘earthly life’ becomes defined by a continuation in a spirit world on the otherside of the grave. Life is the interaction of spirit and matter. If ‘truth issubjectivity,’ then truth is approached by retreating from the region wherespirit and matter interact (i.e. the world) and withdrawing into oneself: intowhat St. Teresa called ‘the interior castle,’ or what Captain Shotover called‘the seventh degree of concentration.’ And Swedenborg’s heaven and hell areirrelevant, whether they exist or not.This also means that much of Swedenborg’s teaching is irrelevant to theOutsider. (I do not mean, of course, that his writings are not worth study; onthe contrary, they soon come to exercise an extraordinary fascination over thestudent. But it is the same fascination as that of Madame Blavatsky’s SecretDoctrine—that of a vast, learned piece of mythology.) And yet his premises areOutsider premises. In the Spiritual Diary he writes, ‘ ... bodily concerns drawdown the ideas of the mind and immerse them in corporeal things,’ 2 and heemphasises the importance of getting free of worldly cares. He sayspenctratingly: ‘A fallacy ... is a judgement of the eye, not of the mind’;3 ashuman beings, we are bullied by appearances. But as soon as we begin to use ourminds to penetrate the world, we find that appearances are deceptive, that oursensations are not to be relied upon. On a spring morning our senses tell usthat ‘God’s in his heaven, All’s right with the world’; a change of weather canbring a change of mood that gives us a completely different ‘philosophy.’ Ourfeelings are linked to the appearance of the world, and if we lived according toour feelings, we would be as unstable as weathercocks. Man ceases to be a mereanimal by deliberately criticising everything his feelings—and his eyes—tellhim. He becomes a more spiritual being by analysing continually, by totalscepticism. But, as I have already pointed out, a sceptic must also be scepticalabout his own scepticism; his own judgement is the first thing he should doubt.And scepticism must not be limited to logical propositions; it must be acontinual sifting of all experience. The ideal philosopher would unite thevisionary power of Swedenborg or Blake with the scepticism of Bertrand Russell;anything less is inadequate. It is lucky that Swedenborg had had forty years ofscientific training when he began to have his extraordinary experiences, but itis a pity that his training was not in philosophy; he might easily haveestablished existentialism on a basis that would have changed the course of ourcivilisation.Swedenborg’s basic assertion, then, is the same as Blake’s or Sartre’s: that themind must learn to be independent of the physical world. Sartre says of the caféproprietor in La Nausée, ‘When the café empties, his head empties too.’ Shawbegins The Apple Cart with a scathing comment on a man who spent his lifearranging pageants and believing in them, and who went insane when he was castup on a desert island because he had no one to talk to. (Later in that play,when Boanerges accuses the king of wishing he could still have people beheaded,the king replies urbanely: ‘Many people would not miss their heads,’ and allShaw’s contempt is compressed into the sentence.) Men should not hold thephysical world in contempt (which is blasphemy), but they should not be enslavedby it, either. Swedenborg, like Blake, has no use for the monastic ideal.Although he withdrew from the world to write, he regarded his own as a specialcase: men are meant to live in the world. He is in complete agreement withHesse, who makes this the moral of most of his novels; man must become greaterby living in the world with the moral strength of a saint and the will power anddiscrimination of a great artist. Steppenwolf’s first comment in Hesse’s novelis that when a man has embarked on the life of the mind, he has left the solidland of the physical world, and may easily steer himself into insanity. But thelife of the mind, even if it brought about the Fall of Man, is the road tobecoming more than man, and it must be embarked on. As opposed to the life ofthe body—life on a primary level of physical experience—it involves living in adifferent world—a world of spiritual perception.And this, no doubt, is one explanation of what Swedenborg meant by his talkabout exploring the spirit world; it may have been his way of trying to explorethe truths of the mind and convey them to ordinary men living a purely primaryexistence. But this explanation is not very plausible—not in the face of theevidence. It may be true that Blake meant the ‘spirit world’ in this way, andthat he talked about ghosts and spirits because that was the only way to jar thephilistines. (Yeats, of course, did precisely that; and admitted it in his lateryears:> Because there is safety in derision> > I talked about an apparition,> > I took no trouble to convince,> > Or seem plausible to a man of sense ...> > Fifteen apparitions have 1 seen;> > The worst a coat upon a coat-hanger.4)But Swedenborg asserted again and again that he meant the spiritual world in areal, not an allegorical sense. His major work, The True Christian Religion, hasmany passages labelled Memorabilia, which begin ‘One day, as I was talking withan angel ... ’ or: ‘As I was walking around hell ... ’ (Blake satirised them inthe ‘Memorable Fancies’ of his Marriage of Heaven and Hell.) It is true that heattaches a great deal of importance to the idea that all sacred writing has twosenses, one literal and obvious, the other spiritual and hidden, and it may wellbe that he means his more discerning readers to ignore his talk about spiritsand concentrate on the meaning of what he is trying to convey by his allegories.On the other hand, it is said that he was in the habit of entering someperfectly down-to-earth argument with a comment like: ‘As a matter of fact, Iwas talking to St. Paul about that very subject only this morning ... ’It might be mentioned that, on the subject of St. Paul, Swedenborg also took theview that Paul’s writings were not particularly inspired, and that his doctrineof the Vicarious Atonement was nonsense. In The Doctrine of the Lord hedismisses it incisively (n. 18), and in the Arcana Coelestia, explains that theSaviour is a symbol of Divine truth, and his power of saving mankind is simplythe power of truth.One thing about Swedenborg is certain: that even if we choose to dismiss thesupernatural element in his teaching, the greatness and insight of his works isnot diminished in the least. He is not merely a theologian; he is apsychologist, as Pascal was. Swedenborgians believe that what distinguishesSwedenborg’s writing from that of Boehme or Blake or Fox is that he is writingat the dictation of spirits. The ordinary mystic, they claim, is too much anerring human being. But there is a fallacy here. Swedenborg himself asserts—withall the mystics—that in the heart of his being, man is really God. He recognisesthe immense difficulties that prevent men from defeating theirhuman-all-too-human stupidity and penetrating to that still centre. But there isno such thing as ‘dictation by spirits.’ There is only dictation by the spirit,which lies at the centre of man. It is only loose thinking to call this ‘thespirit of man’ (as the humanists are inclined to). Man is simply a dirty filterthrough which the spirit has to penetrate.To say all this is not to devalue Swedenborg. On the contrary, it is an attemptto rescue him from the pigeon-hole with Madame Blavatsky and Mary Baker Eddy towhich the twentieth century has assigned him. He was far too gifted, modest andwell-adjusted a man to be dismissed as a mere crank. Attempts to ‘explain away’such thinkers as Pascal and Swedenborg by a glib use of the terms ofpsychoanalysis merely serve to indicate how much we need their insight, at atime when rationalism is dying on us, and almost crushing us. The teachers ofthe reality of the Will are relevant as never before.* Boehme was also known as Behmen or Behm in England up to the beginning of thepresent century."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE—WILLIAM LAWThere is very little to tell of the life of William Law that could not becompressed into two long paragraphs. We know nothing of his inner life incomparison with what we know of Swedenborg’s or Boehme’s; there are no dramaticdocuments, like Pascal’s Memorial or Mystère de Jesus, no crises or longillnesses or sudden illuminations. In comparison with George Fox or John Wesley,his life was flat and uneventful. For all that, he was one of the greatest andmost powerful minds ever produced by the Church of England, and no examinationof the mystics would be complete without reference to him.Law was born in King’s Cliffe, Northhamptonshire, in 1686, the son of a grocer.He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, when he was nineteen; he was a ‘sizar,’that is, one who is partly supported by the college funds, and performs certainmenial services in exchange. By the time he was twenty-five he had become afellow, and seemed set for a quiet and retired life as a college don.Undoubtedly it would have suited him. But George I came to the throne, anddemanded an oath of loyalty from everyone in authority; Law supported the StuartPretender, and refused to swear. He then resigned his fellowship in anticipationof being deprived of it.The remainder of Law’s life falls into two main periods: the first from 1720 to1740, during most of which time he acted as tutor to Edward Gibbon (thehistorian’s father) at Putney and wrote a number of controversial works; thesecond from 1740 to his death twenty years later, when he returned to his nativevillage of King’s Cliffe and lived a semi-monastic life, writing the greatmystical books based on Boehme’s teachings.He first came to prominence as a writer in 1717, the year after he had resignedhis fellowship. It was in a controversy with Bishop Hoadly, the Bishop ofBangor. Hoadly was a good-natured man, easygoing, charitable, learned—ratherlike a Peacock character—and his views were distinctly liberal and broad church.He had preached a famous sermon defending the interference of the state inChurch affairs; where it was a question of Church and state, Hoadly said, thestate should be master, and the Church stick to its own realm—the realm of thespirit. Law held Ivan Karamazov’s view that the state ought to be no more than adepartment of the Church. He published his Letters to the Bishop of Bangor,which brought him the same kind of overnight celebrity that the ProvincialLetters had brought Pascal (except that, in this case, there was no secret aboutthe author’s identity). Law was a formidable controversialist, and perhaps morethan a little unfair. For instance, the Bishop had alleged that Roman Catholicsmust be excluded from the throne, not on account of their religion considered assuch, ‘but the fatal, natural, certain effects of it to our destruction.’ Thisis a straightforward enough proposition; a good parallel would be to say thatone could not allow a Negro on the throne of England, not because of anyobjection to the colour of his skin, but because it would cause complications inBritish West Africa. But Law chooses a less fair parallel:> As for instance your Lordship may mean thus: if a man of a great estate dies,> he loses his right to his estate; not upon the fatal account of death,> considered as such, but for the certain fatal, natural effect of it upon> himself. Or, suppose a person be excluded for being an idiot; it is not for> his idiocy, considered as such; but for the certain, fatal, natural effect of> it upon himself to our destruction.> > My Lord, this is prodigious deep ... 1Law’s argument is, of course, unfair, but it takes several minutes’ thought tosee where it is unfair, and most of his readers did not bestow that much time onit.Five years after this first controversial masterpiece came a second one; hisreply to Mandeville’s Fable of the Bees. Bernard de Mandeville’s book waswritten in doggerel couplets, and advanced a sort of Marxist thesis thatreligion is a fiction invented to help govern society, and that only the vicesof men tend towards progress, since they stimulate the circulation of capital.Law’s reply is a superb piece of caustic and vigorous prose that does not loseby comparison with Swift or Voltaire. (Being an English masterpiece, it hasnaturally been out of print in England for the past hundred years.)His most startling work—in the eyes of the modern reader—is his pamphlet TheAbsolute Unlawfulness of Stage Entertainments, in which he makes an even moreviolent onslaught on the theatre than Collier had made in his famous pamphlet ofthirty years before. Law attacks the theatre, not for its immorality, butbecause he found it a silly waste of time (as Dr. Johnson found the opera). Hiscondemnation is so violent—as violent as Pascal’s in the Pensées—that mostwriters on Law have felt it necessary to try to excuse him. Yet his attitude ishardly surprising, in an age when the comedies were usually cheap farces and thetragedies rehashed versions of Elizabethan plays. Even without thisjustification, his attitude should be easily comprehensible to the modern world,where there is still the same division between serious-minded and cheapentertainment, and the latest jazz singer or film star is idolised by millions.But the essential William Law emerged fully in A Serious Call to a Devout andHoly Life. This work exercised immense influence on its own and succeeding ages,and is still the only work of Law’s which is easily obtainable today. Dr.Johnson, who disliked Law because he was a non-juror, and because latterly hewas influenced by Boehme (whom Johnson regarded as ‘crack-brained’), called it‘the finest piece of hortatory theology in any language,’ and confessed: ‘Whenat Oxford, I took it up expecting to find a dull book, and perhaps to laugh atit. But I found Law quite an overmatch for me.’ The book was a powerfulinfluence on John and Charles Wesley and George Whitefield. Even thesophisticated agnostic Gibbon came under its spell. There is a famous story ofFroude and Keble which shows the influence of the book over a hundred yearsafter its publication. Hurrell Froude (elder brother of the historian) waswaiting to see Keble to his coach. Keble seemed to have something on his mind.At the last moment, Keble blurted out: ‘Froude, you said you thought Law’sSerious Call a clever book; it seemed to me as if you had said the Day ofJudgement will be a pretty sight.’Like Pascal’s Provincial Letters, A Serious Call maintains its thesis by using anovelist’s devices; its argument proceeds with a series of vignettes. Forinstance:> Julius is very fearful of missing Prayers; all the Parish supposes Julius to> be sick, if he is not at Church. But if you was to ask him why he spends the> rest of his time by humour and chance? why he is a companion of the silliest> People in their most silly pleasures? why he is ready for every impertinent> entertainment and diversion. If you was to ask him why there is no amusement> too trifling to please him? why he is busy at all balls and assemblies? why he> gives himself up to an idle gossiping conversation ...> > If a man was to tell Julius that there was no occasion for so much constancy> at Prayers, and that he might, without harm to himself, neglect the service of> the Church ... Julius would think such a one to be no Christian, and that he> ought to avoid his company. But if a person only tells him, that he may live> as the generality of the world does, that he may enjoy himself as others do,> that he may spend his time and money as People of fashion do, that he may> conform to the follies and frailties of the generality, and gratify his> tempers and passions as most People do, Julius would never suspect that man to> want a Christian spirit, or that he is doing the devil’s work.> > And yet if Julius was to read all the New Testament from the beginning to the> end, he would find his course of life condemn’d in every page of it.2This is clean, hard-hitting prose. In its clarity, it has something in commonwith Shaw; certainly much in common with Pascal. Law might be that ‘inspiredchurchman’ of whom Larry Doyle speaks in the passage from John Bull’s OtherIsland that I have quoted. But observe also the firm Outsider-Insider contrastin the paragraph. Having said this, I have made my most important point aboutLaw: that although his life gives us no reason to bracket him with the‘Outsiders,’ yet the content of his writing very emphatically does. Law seems tohave been lucky enough to have found his place in the Church without muchdifficulty; but if he had been born two hundred years later, his attitudetowards society would almost certainly have been the same as Rimbaud’s or JamesJoyce’s or D. H. Lawrence’s. What is expressed most clearly in all this earlywork of Law is not a specifically Christian attitude (as in St. Francis orSuso), but the attitude of a man with a hunger for reality, a desire that hislife should be far more serious than other people’s, a man with all theOutsider’s hatred of triviality and purposelessness. On the title page of Law’sworks, the statement, ‘The Outsider’s salvation lies in extremes,’ would not beout of place. It is not a specifically Christian viewpoint that Law is trying toenforce; it is the Outsider’s viewpoint. It is a question of existentialism:that is to say, a question of living. Law calls it ‘the right use of the world’:> It is this right use of the world, that I would lead you into, by directing> you to turn your eyes upon every shape of human folly, that you may thence> draw fresh arguments and motives of living to the best and greatest purposes> of your creation.3 [My italics.]He understands the Outsider’s concept that man is his own enemy: that all menare murdered by an enemy they carry around inside them, and that all men’s livesare robbed of meaning by self-division. The answer is discipline and asceticism:> If religion requires us sometimes to fast, and deny our natural appetites, His> to lessen that struggle and war that is our nature.4 [My italics.]His picture of the religious man, translated into twentieth-century terms, is aportrait of the Outsider. His rule for judging whether men are religious is toask: ‘Do they live as if they belonged to different worlds, had different viewsin their heads, and different rules and measures of all their actions?’ 5 Applythis standard to Lawrence, Nijinsky, Rimbaud, Van Gogh; it fits them as well asit fits Fox or Nicholas Ferrar; ‘ ... as if they belonged to different worlds.’There is the Outsider’s strength and the Outsider’s detachment in Law; passageafter passage sounds like an Outsider’s credo: ‘ ... to renounce all its goods,to fear none of its evils, to reject its joys, and to have no value for itshappiness.’6 This might have been taken from Stephen Dedalus’s ‘credo’ at theend of the Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. And Law faces the usualcomplaint that the Outsider takes life too seriously:> Some people perhaps object ... that by depriving ourselves of so many ...> innocent pleasures, we shall render our lives dull, uneasy and melancholy. To> which it may be answered: First, that these rules are prescrib’d for, and will> certainly procure a quite contrary end. That instead of making our lives dull> and melancholy, they will render them full of content and strong> satisfactions. That by these rules we only change the childish satisfactions> of our vain and sickly passions, for the solid enjoyments and real happiness> of a sound mind.7In the silly essay which I have already quoted, Canon Bigg has made at least onegood comment on Law; that he was ‘a real man insisting on reality.’ And this isprecisely what the Outsider is: a rebel against inanity.The more one reads Law, the more he reminds one of Bernard Shaw. A Serious Callis an optimistic book; it produces an effect of balance and infectious commonsense, and one feels that Law knows what he is about. If one could speak ofhortatory theology as one can speak of poetry, one could say that its merit liesin inducing a state of mind in which everything looks cleaner and harder. Nodoubt if Law had written in the twentieth instead of the eighteenth century, hewould have had the same accusation flung at him that Shaw had: that he was‘heartless,’ a ‘walking brain-box without feelings.’ A Serious Call and thethird act of Man and Superman have exactly the same attitude towards the ‘world’and the life of drifting self-indulgence which ‘civilisation’ calls pleasure.Law even has some of Shaw’s faults as a dramatist: he conjures up people whofail to gain the sympathy of the reader; he is inclined to underestimate thereader’s intelligence. Among the people in A Serious Call there are an awfulpair called Flavia and Miranda; one a scatterbrained society woman, the other amodel of Christian womanhood. Both alienate the reader thoroughly, and there areother couples who have the same effect: Leo and Eusebius, Sussuras and Matilda.But this is not an important flaw in a great book, where there are ten successesto every failure. Here is a further example of Law’s character-drawing; thebusiness tycoon:> Calidus has traded above thirty years in the greatest city in the kingdom; he> has been so many years constantly increasing his trade and his fortune. Every> hour of the day is with him an hour of business; and though he eats and drinks> very heartily, yet every meal seems to be in a hurry, and he would say grace> if he had time. Calidus ends every day at the tavern, but has not leisure to> be there till nine o’clock. He is always forc’d to drink a good hearty glass,> to drive thoughts of business out of his head, and make his spirits drowsy> enough for sleep. He does business all the time that he is rising, and has> settled several matters before he can get to his compting-room. His prayers> are a short ejaculation or two, which he never misses in stormy tempestuous> weather, because he has always something or other at Sea. Calidus will tell> you with great pleasure, that he has been in this hurry for so many years, and> that it must have kill’d him long ago, but that it has been a rule with him to> get out of town every Saturday and make the Sunday a day of quiet and good> refreshment in the country.> > He is now so rich, that he would leave off his business, and amuse his old age> with building and furnishing a fine house in the country, but that he is> afraid he should grow melancholy, if he was to quit his business. He will tell> you with great gravity, that it is a dangerous thing for a man that has been> us’d to get money, ever to leave it off. If thoughts of Religion happen at any> time to steal into his head, Calidus contents himself with thinking that he> never was a friend to hereticks and infidels, that he has always been civil to> the Minister of his parish, and very often given something to the charity> schools.8Note the fine touch about Calidus not giving up business ‘because he is afraidhe should grow melancholy,’ and its implication that this man has learned tomaster a fortune and is still a slave to his own moods—mentally as soft asputty. Law knew about the Outsider’s problems as well as Pascal or Gurdjieff.His Serious Call is summarised in his injunction: ... ‘let us judge ourselvessincerely, let us not vainly content ourselves with the common disorders of ourlives.’9 Alter this last phrase to ‘let us not vainly content ourselves with thecommon futility of our lives,’ and again Law has paraphrased the Outsider’s aim:the need for self-analysis, sincerity, a sense of purpose and reality.It was in or about 1737 that Law first read Boehme; perhaps the most importantsingle event of his life. At some time between 1738 and 1740, he retired toKing’s Cliffe, and settled down to studying the works of Boehme in the original.(He is said to have translated some of Boehme; the Dialogue on the SupersensualLife, to be found in the Everyman edition of the Signatura Rerum, is ascribed toLaw; if so, Law not only translated, but added greatly to the original, ascomparison with the recent translation by J. J. Stoudt will show). There he wasjoined by two maiden ladies, who accepted him as their spiritual director. Forthe last twenty years of his life, the routine at King’s Cliffe resembled inmany ways the routine of Little Gidding, with devoutness and prayer, almsgiving,the building of a school, care of the local poor, and so forth. In this period,he produced the works which are now generally recognised to be his greatest: TheSpirit of Prayer and The Spirit of Love. In these works, the Shaviancontroversialist has completely disappeared. The atmosphere is one of devoutnessand humility. Having withdrawn from the world, Law tried to see a total orderand meaning in it. His ‘philosophy’ was Boehme’s in every detail, except for histoning-down of Boehme’s harsh doctrine of damnation. All the emphasis is placedon learning complete non-attachment; it could be summarised in Blake’s lines:> The Angel that presided o’er my birth> > Said, ‘Little creature, form’d of Joy and Mirth,> > ‘Go love without the help of any Thing on Earth.’10One might make against Law the objection that he had a great deal to ‘help himto love’: a quiet, easy life, enough money, a high reputation. It isSwedenborg’s objection, that man is intended for life in the world, not forsolitude and withdrawal. But perhaps Swedenborg’s excuse applies to Law too:that he had a special mission to fulfil. The great mystical books of his lastperiod are their own justification; an extraordinary serenity breathes throughthem. One gets the same satisfaction from them that one gets from aphilosophical ‘system’ like Hegel’s or Kant’s: all discords seem to be resolved;the difficulties of the world have disappeared. But one never feels that Law hasaccomplished this by shutting his eyes and inventing a fool’s paradise. The‘sense of reality’ does not desert him. As with Shaw and Nietzsche, immenseemphasis is placed on Will. Man fell from divine perfection by deciding tofollow his own miserable, shortsighted will instead of the Will of the powerthat created him. In doing this, he lost his will power, lost his sense ofgodhood, became a shortsighted, self-seeking flea, like Nietzsche’s last man.Regeneration can come by striving with all his mind and heart to escape thenarrow vision of a mere man: trying to comprehend the Will of the power thatdrives him, and to turn his own will into that greater Will. In describing thisstate, Law uses the same phrase that Shaw used in the last speech of Back toMethuselah: ‘no life is any longer a burden.’ This what the Outsider is seeking.His life is a burden; moments of vision tell him that life need not be a burden,but an ecstasy of will power and love. This is the vision that fills the work ofLaw’s last twenty years. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to representthis prose by quotation; its characteristic is the tightness of its structure,the closeness of its argument. Paragraphs occur far less frequently than in theearlier work. It is as if Law knew precisely where he was going, and needed nobreaks to relieve his thought. Undoubtedly, it ranks with the greatest prose ofits kind in our language, which makes it all the more regrettable that it isalmost unobtainable today.* Law, the greatest of the English mystics, isvirtually unknown in England, and it has remained for a Frenchman to write thefirst book on his greatness as a stylist.*Law was not a mystic in the popular sense: a man who was continually seeingvisions and plunging into trances. Late in his life, he confessed that he was ‘astranger to revelation.’ This is because he was a man of great intellect, andhis self-discipline was too great to allow those moments when the will isoverthrown and the senses reel. All his revelation came through the intellect;and (as I commented in The Outsider) the intellect is made drunk with its ownpower far less readily than the body or the emotions. Law was great because hewas not an emotional man. He did not take trips to the spirit world, likeSwedenborg, nor sink into samadhi like Ramakrishna. More than any other greatmystic, his bent was intellectual; and it is this which gives him his importancein a study of the Outsider’s problems. His kind of greatness is the kind neededmost urgently in a declining civilisation. He was religious in the mostessential meaning of the word; not out of any emotional need or human weakness,but out of sheer strength: the craving of a powerful mind and a vital will forstill greater health, and deeper consciousness and vitality.* The only edition I know is Stephen Hobhouse’s excellent anthology SelectedMystical Writings of William Law (Rockliff), which, as well as long extractsfrom Law’s major mystical writings, contains several lengthy essays by theeditor which cover every aspect of Law’s theology. Its companion volume isBishop Martensen’s book on Boehme.* William Law, by Henri Talon (Rockliff)"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX—JOHN HENRY NEWMANWith the exception of William Law, all the religious figures with whom I havedealt so far have been ‘Outsiders’ in the obvious meaning of the word—strangersin society. Neither Law nor Newman—the subject of the present chapter—areOutsiders in that spectacular sense; neither of them had visions, turned theirbacks on society, or behaved in an extraordinary fashion. Why then, one mightask, bother to deal with them at all?Part of the purpose of this book is to try to show that the solution reached byLaw and Newman is valid for the Outsider generally. I do not mean that Law andNewman provided a positive and final solution—no one has ever done that—butthat, in different circumstances, both of them might have been Outsiders ascompletely as Dostoevsky or Nietzsche or George Fox. They were both lucky enoughto belong to Churches whose teachings justified their antisocial feelings, withthe paradoxical result that instead of becoming tormented misfits, they werevaluable members of society.Newman was born in 1801, the son of a London banker. We know little about hischildhood, except that he seems to have been a frail, shortsighted child, fondof his parents and of reading. He was given to daydreaming, and particularlyinterested in stories of magic or ghosts (he remained interested in ghosts allhis life). Descriptions of Newman as a boy bring to mind James Joyce’sself-portrait in his Portrait of the Artist—the delicate health, self-isolationfrom other children, the sensitivity and precocious intellectualism. His parentswere proud of his precociousness, and encouraged it by praise and attention. Atseven he was sent to a school in Ealing, and soon became the most promisingpupil in the school. He was always shy and solitary, but his brilliance broughthim admirers—even worshippers—and he never developed a strong sense of‘apartness’; throughout his life, he never lacked for close friends. At fifteencame his first ‘conversion’; this seems to have been due more to his ownprecocious meditations than to the influence of any particular person onhim—although he speaks of the influence of a clergyman named Mayers. In thefollowing year he went up to Trinity College, Oxford, and continued hisbrilliant scholastic career. At twenty, he sat for his degree, and failedspectacularly; he was (as Sir Geoffrey Faber observes) ‘incapable of doinganything by halves.’ He had worked too hard and was mentally stale. For a yearhe relaxed, pottered around amusing himself with mineralogy and chemistry, andstudied mathematics to discipline his mind. Then he decided to stand for anOriel fellowship. On this occasion he had no time to get himself worked into a‘state,’ and sailed through the examinations easily. The legend has it that thebutler who brought the news to the successful candidates found Newman playingthe fiddle. In his facetious way, the butler announced that he had disagreeablenews to impart. Newman went on fiddling. ‘Mr. Newman has been elected a Fellowof Oriel, and his presence is required by the Provost.’ Newman had no sense ofhumour, and merely nodded, and went on fiddling. As soon as the butler haddisappeared, he threw down his violin and rushed out of the room as fast as hislegs would carry him. One wonders whether Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had this storyin mind when he endowed Sherlock Holmes with his passion for the violin!Portraits of Newman’s pale aquiline face irresistibly recall that of the greatdetective.As a Fellow of Oriel, he was shy and gauche, and worked harder than ever. Twoyears later, he was ordained, and became the curate of St. Clement’s, Oxford.When he was twenty-seven, he became vicar of St. Mary’s. Now began the period ofNewman’s greatest influence at Oxford.He had been a tutor at Oriel for two years; naturally, his pupils came to hearhim preach. Until then, very few undergraduates had attended services at St.Mary’s. But Newman proved to be an extraordinary preacher. He did not shout andthreaten fire and brimstone; he talked quietly and hesitantly, and withpenetrating psychological insight. He had some sort of hypnotic power as apreacher. Students came to hear him, and were disappointed, having been told toexpect something extraordinary. But they came back the following week out ofcuriosity, and Newman’s strange charm had them bound hand and foot. He had alight, silvery voice, and a habit of talking slowly, with long pauses, until hisown words seemed to carry him away, and his conviction was transmitted like awarm current into the audience. Soon, Newman had become one of the mostinfluential men in Oxford. Before he had been appointed to St. Mary’s, he hadachieved complete sway over the minds of his pupils at Oriel; now his pulpitbrought him a host of disciples. A few years later, the Provost of Oriel showedhis apprehension of this power of Newman’s, and deliberately tried to weaken hisinfluence; Newman resigned his tutorship and went for a long holiday in theMediterranean. In his five years of preaching from the pulpit at St. Mary’s hehad demonstrated that his genius was the genius of a George Fox or a T. E.Lawrence—the power of binding other minds by his conviction.On his return to England, Newman became associated with an enterprise which wasto make him even more influential than he had been before: together with Keble,Hurrell Froude and Pusey, he initiated the Tractarian Movement—better known asthe Oxford Movement. Newman wrote the first of a series of tracts which, likePascal’s Provincial Letters, gained an astonishingly wide audience. JohnKeble—the author of The Christian Year—was the real originator of the OxfordMovement. He was several years older than Newman, a quiet little man who lookedmore like a schoolboy than a religious reformer; but his conviction thatreligion was dying out in Victorian England was deep-rooted and passionate, andhe had the power of communicating it to his pupils. Hurrell Froude, brother ofthe historian, decided that Keble’s beliefs must be made more public: that theymade good ‘fighting talk.’ Newman fired the first shot. His aim wasfundamentally the same as Pascal’s in the Provincial Letters—to attack laxnessand worldliness in the Church.Finally, Newman’s belief was as extreme as Ivan Karamazov’s—he wanted to see theChurch given complete power over the State. Pusey was another powerful ally—ascholar who had studied German philosophy, and who felt that his mission was tofight intellectual atheism. Together, the ‘Tractarians’ constituted anaggressive younger generation (Keble, the eldest, was only in his forties),asserting a standard of values that the nineteenth century had almost forgotten.When the first tracts were collected into a volume, it promptly became somethingof a ‘best seller.’Newman should have been born in the Middle Ages. The Church he longed for wasthe intellectual citadel of St. Bernard and Aquinas; not the poor, battered,dismembered Protestant Church of the nineteenth century. In the tracts, hetended to develop his conception of an ideal Church—much as H. G. Wellsdeveloped his notion of the ideal State sixty years later; it was nostalgicdaydreaming. And naturally, since the Church for which Newman longed was theCatholic Church of the Middle Ages, his dream-picture in the tracts began tolook more and more like the Catholic Church of his own day. Finally, in TractNo. 90, Newman argued that the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of Englandwere in no way incompatible with the creed of the Roman Catholic Church.Immediately, the storm broke. Roman Catholics were not popular in England—theyhad been completely suppressed for a long period, and were still a suspectedminority. Newman’s enemies were convinced that he had been won over to Rome.Churchmen all over England were indignant. The Bishop of London declaredpublicly that nothing on earth would induce him to ordain a man who held theopinions of Tract No. 90. Newman’s own bishop rebuked him, and Newman acceptedthe censure quietly. He withdrew to Littlemore, to a quiet, monastic retreatwhich he and a few friends had built; there they lived a life of great austerityand prayer. A year later, he published an anonymous retraction of all the hardthings which he had said formerly against the Catholics, and in 1845, when hewas forty-four, he was received into the Church of Rome. His period of retreatat Littlemore had caused almost as much public gossip as T. E. Lawrence’s laterretreat into the R.A.F. was to cause; he was a leader, a man of considerableinfluence, who suddenly turned his back on public affairs. Now, when he became aRoman Catholic, Mr. Gladstone expressed his horror, and a long wail went up fromhis many admirers.There followed a long period of obscurity for Newman. He went to Rome, where hewas ordained priest, and studied quietly for four years, returning to England asan Oratorian. When he was forty-nine, he delivered a series of lectures onCatholicism in England, during one of which he attacked a certain Dr. Achilli, aformer Dominican friar who had turned to denigrating the Church of Rome. Achillisued Newman for libel; anti-Catholic feeling was strong at the time, and Newmanwas found guilty, and ordered to pay damages of over £14,000. The sum was raisedby English Catholics; but it was an unpleasant defeat for Newman, who had beenused to having the taste of victory in his mouth. It must have seemed to himthat the fates had turned against him since he had entered the Church of Rome.Four years later, he was invited to become rector of the newly establishedCatholic University of Dublin. But once again, he was frustrated; he put up withfour years of irritating and trivial complications, and then resigned. Hesubsequently proposed to found a ‘House of the Oratory’ at Oxford, but CardinalManning opposed the idea, and it fell through. It seemed that Newman’s lot hadbecome perpetual defeat.At least one good thing had come out of his Dublin period: a series of lectureson university education, published in pamphlet form as Discourses on UniversityEducation, and later enlarged and re-titled: The Idea of a University. Importantas it was, this work excited no great sensation when it came out, and Newmanreacted to increasing public neglect by retreating more and more into his ownself-made corner of the world at Birmingham, to the Oratory of St. Philip Neri,where he had his own school.His opportunity came unexpectedly, six years later. Charles Kingsley publishedan attack on him in Macmillan’s Magazine, casting doubt on his intellectualhonesty and on that of the whole Catholic priesthood. Newman felt that theeasiest way to vindicate his attitude would be to recount with completesincerity how he had arrived at his beliefs. He published a pamphlet which beganboldly:> It may easily be conceived how great a trial it is to me to write the> following history of myself; but I must not shrink from the task ... I was> brought up from a child to take great delight in reading the Bible ... 1He went on to describe his ‘conversion’ and the origins of the Oxford Movement,and promised further pamphlets to complete the story. These pamphlets enjoyed animmediate and immense success, and they were soon republished in book form,under the title Apologia pro vita sua. The modern reader may find it difficultto understand why the Apologia won such success and re-established Newman’sreputation so quickly; to do so, we must see the book in the context of its age.In 1860, four years before Newman published the Apologia, there appeared avolume called Essays and Reviews, a collection of essays about the Church andmodern science, with one essay by Jowett, the translator of Plato, mildlysupporting the cause of science against the dogmas of the Church. The subsequentsensation was comparable to that created by Ulysses or Lady Chatterley’s Lover,and Jowett was reviled by the orthodox. Essays and Reviews was widely readbecause it tried to let a little light and air into the question of religion,and Newman’s book attained popularity for exactly the same reason. In theVictorian age, frankness and intellectual honesty sent the public scurrying tothe bookshops. Unless this is realised, it will be difficult to come to anyunderstanding of Newman’s life and work, and impossible to understand our ownposition, in the mid-twentieth century. Newman had an Outsider’s appetite forseriousness of purpose, like Law and Ferrar and Pascal. But his precursors werenot Outsiders in the modern sense of the word—the sense of being completely outof sympathy with their time. When they attacked irreligiousness, they werelistened to respectfully. When Newman attacked it—as in his controversy with Dr.Achilli—he was jeered at and accused of dishonesty. He was an Outsider inconflict with Insiders. The same is true of Kierkegaard, Newman’s junior bytwelve years (of whom I shall speak in the next chapter), and of Nietzsche. Halfa century later, Shaw and Dean Inge—two of the outstanding religious teachers oftheir day—were forced to adopt the tactics of Insiders—journalism and wit—tomake themselves heard at all.This is the importance of the Apologia. It is one of the earliest Outsiderdocuments of modern times. Law wrote a Serious Call to religion; Newman had towrite an apology for it. The Insider temper had begun to dominate the age.The Apologia not only re-established Newman as an influential public figure; italso gave a tremendous impetus to the cause of Roman Catholicism in England.Unlike his contemporary, Cardinal Manning, Newman did not adopt the irritatingtone of a man who ‘knows he is saved’; instead, he talked with the hesitant,self-analytical tone of a great artist, more concerned with expressing himselfthan with converting others. The result was a formidable contribution to theintellectual traditions of the Catholic Church.Newman was already sixty-three when the Apologia appeared, but he had anotherquarter of a century of life in front of him: the studious, uneventful life ofan introspective artist. He published one more book of the first rank: theGrammar of Assent, written when he was sixty-eight. Ten years later, Pope LeoXIII made him a Cardinal, an appointment which was received with acclamation byCatholics and non-Catholics alike. By this time, Newman was tired: he was old,his health was poor (he had always been frail), and the journey to Rome mighteasily have been his last. Instead, it seemed to give him new life; after aserious illness in Rome, he returned to England, and again took up residence atthe Oratory in Birmingham. During the last ten years of his life, he made manyvisits to London, and continued to preach and write until his death at the ageof eighty-nine.I have said that Newman’s chief significance, in this context, is that he wasthe first English religious figure to be sniped at by Insiders on definiteanti-Outsider grounds. The decline of Western civilisation becomes recognisablein Newman’s time. Newman recognised that decline early in his career—although,not being a historian, he did not recognise the parallel with previouscivilisations. In 1841, he wrote a series of letters to The Times, published inbook form as The Tamworth Reading Room, in which he attacked the idea that mereknowledge makes men greater. Sir Robert Peel had made a speech about theestablishment of a library at Tamworth, in which he had expressed his faith inscientific knowledge, and its power to make men rise to higher things. Newmanasks ‘how wonderful moral effects are to be wrought under the instrumentality ofphysical science,’ and goes on to contend that the idea is an impossibility.Lord Brougham had expressed the same faith in the power of science, and Newmananswered him, as well. ‘Human nature wants recasting, but Lord Brougham is allfor tinkering it.’2 Brougham and Peel both felt that man could become religiousmerely by contemplating ‘the immense mystery of nature.’ Newman’s objection isthe same as that of the Grand Inquisitor: ‘Only great men can. What about theothers?’ In these letters of Newman’s, there are two important strands whichwere never to disappear from his outlook: contempt for logic, and a feeling thatreligion begins with instinct, conscience, a hunger for meaning. Like Boehme,his religious attitude is existentialist; in the sixth letter of The TamworthReading Room, he states:> Life is for action ... Life is not long enough for a religion of inferences> ... To act, you must assume, and that assumption is faith.3 [My italics.]Newman believed, as F. R. Cronin has written, that ‘certitude is is for theintellectual élite.’ In other words, the Grand Inquisitor’s master-and-slavemorality underlies Newman’s religious doctrines.Newman’s novel Loss and Gain has something in common with the Cranly pages ofJoyce’s Portrait: it is about a young man becoming a Catholic; but its longarguments are not, like Stephen’s arguments, an escape from Catholicism, but amovement towards it. Newman’s hero, Charles Reding, is sent down from Oxford fordoubting the Thirty-nine Articles. One of the men who lead him to doubt theChurch of England is a Dr. Brownside, a liberal divine, for whom Revelation‘instead of being the abyss of God’s councils, with its dim outlines and broadshadows, [is] a flat sunny plain, laid out with straight macadamised roads.’4Obviously, Newman’s feelings about life are closer to Dostoevsky’s than to Dr.Brownside’s; he detests two-dimensional logical thinking as much as Dostoevsky’sbeetle-man, in Notes from Under the Floorboards.In The Outsider I cited the key passage from the last chapter of Newman’sApologia, but it is too important not to quote again:> Starting, then, with the being of God (which, as I have said, is as certain to> me as the certainty of my own existence ... ) I look out of myself into the> world of men, and there I see a sight which fills me with unspeakable> distress. The world seems simply to give the lie to that great truth, of which> my whole being is so full ... If I looked into a mirror, and did not see my> face, I should have the sort of feeling which actually comes upon me, when I> look into this living busy world, and see no reflection of its Creator ...> > To consider the world in its length and breadth, its various history, the many> races of man ... the disappointments of life, the defeat of good, the success> of evil, physical pain, mental anguish, the prevalence and intensity of sin> ... the corruptions, the dreary hopeless irreligion ... all this is a vision> to dizzy and appal; and inflicts upon the mind the sense of a profound> mystery, which is absolutely beyond human solution.> > What shall be said to this heart-piercing, reason-bewildering fact? I can only> answer, that either there is no Creator, or this living society of men is in a> true sense discarded from his presence ... And so I argue about the world: if> there be a God ... the human race is implicated in some terrible, aboriginal> calamity.5This is the grimmige Einsicht that Rilke spoke of, the terrible insight, thefeeling of Malte Laurids Brigge. It is obvious, from this passage, that Newmanwas no Blakean visionary. When Boehme or Van Gogh looked at the ‘living world,’they were dazzled by the reflection of its Creator. Newman never knew thisexperience, which perhaps accounts for his comparative failure as a poet. Hisbest-known poems are The Dream of Gerontius (from which the lovely hymn ‘Praiseto the Holiest in the Height’ comes), and the three stanzas of ‘Lead, KindlyLight.’ The language of Newman’s poetry is commonplace; ‘Lead, Kindly Light’ isas commonplace as the rest, but was written when Newman had half made up hismind to become a Catholic, and was tormented by doubts: it is a striking proofof Yeats’s theory that the most moving poetry is written out of a sudden intenseemotion, which does not depend upon great language for its effect.*Newman’s most important work—certainly the work which gave him most trouble—isthe Essay in aid of a Grammar of Assent. The title is deliberately modest (Eliotfollowed its example in Notes Towards the Definition of Culture), which,considering the magnitude of the subject, is hardly surprising. Newman’s aim isthe same as Pascal’s in the Pensées—to justify religion to unbelievers. The bookis extremely difficult reading; it is obviously intended to browbeat the sort ofphilosopher who thinks that Hume and Mill have said the last word aboutreligious belief. Newman simply wants to show how it is possible to assent toreligious belief without falling into intellectual dishonesty. It cannottruthfully be said—even by Newman’s greatest admirer—that he succeeds. He setsout to analyse the question of assent in the manner of Mill’s Logic. Now one cananticipate the whole enquiry by asking a simple question: Can logic lead toreligion? The answer (as Wittgenstein and Whitehead asserted) is: No.Nevertheless, many valuable ideas are enunciated in the Grammar, and it willjustify a closer analysis, in this chapter, than any of Newman’s other works.Newman begins with a simple distinction: between real assent and notionalassent. Real assent is the assent one makes with the whole being, not just withthe intellect. He then passes to the question of the existence of God, andattempts to show that the existence of conscience—of a sense of moral law—pointsto the reality of God. He attempts to show that the reality of God is at leastas certain as the reality of the physical world; for we infer the physical worldfrom the fragmentary impressions which our senses fling at us, and we infer theexistence of God from the fragmentary twinges of our conscience or sense ofmoral purpose. An imbecile never draws any conclusions from the world aroundhim; a man of scientific genius never ceases to draw conclusions about it. So amoral imbecile learns nothing about the laws of his spirit; the prophet andsaint (and, we might add, the Outsider) observe the operation of a need forgreater intensity of life in themselves, the need for purpose, the need tounderstand, and try to imagine, to envision, what man would be like if he couldfollow this urge to its utmost limit.Part II of the Grammar asks how mere inference can lead to assent, and answers:By the balance of probability. A sufficient number of probabilities, allconverging, constitute a certainty. Newman invents the term ‘Illative sense,’which is man’s ability to weigh up probabilities and extract a certainty fromthem. Some people have more of this Illative sense than others. For instance,Newton had an extraordinary gift for sensing where lines of thought converged,and ‘intuiting’ a conclusion where a lesser man would have been hopelesslyconfused. This is the power possessed by the great religious minds; but in theircase, the ‘facts’ are not physical phenomena or numbers, but psychologicalfacts—the facts of man’s spiritual life. Newman anticipates Sartre by denyingthat Man is a universal idea, of which all individual men are examples. All menare individual things, independent, incommunicable. He comes very close tosaying, with Hesse, that ‘man is a bourgeois compromise’—there is no such thingas ‘man,’ only individual men. In other words, although Newman did not realiseit, he was propounding the fundamental idea of existentialism: In man, existenceprecedes essence. Newman announces his lack of faith in formal logic; formallogic uses words which are divested of their historic and poetic association.This can only lead to abstraction, and religion is not abstraction. Man’sbusiness is to use his logical faculty to get to the concrete, and to do this,he must think in terms of the concrete. It is no proof of religion to talk about‘man,’ or to try to prove God by algebra; one must talk about individuals: aboutindividuals under spiritual strain. (Newman does not take the next step andadmit that the best person to do this will obviously be the novelist or poet,not the philosopher.)It will be seen, by this time, that Newman has not succeeded in producing alogical proof of religion, or a logical justification of assent. Although he haswritten a book which seems logical in its method, he has actually declared in itthat logic is no final guide: one abstraction can only lead to another. Man’sbusiness is to try to weigh up the world; and the world is not just the universearound him, it is the universe behind his eyes. What man wants is an assumptionupon which he can act: a belief that will give him purpose. And the finalcriterion of the value of a belief is: How long can a man go on acting by it?Alexander had a belief that gave him a tremendous sense of purpose; his beliefthat it was his destiny to rule the world. But when he had conquered the world,he asked despairingly: What now? That is the test of any belief. If a sense ofpurpose can come to an end, then it is not one of real purpose, of ultimatepurpose. But religion is supposed to supply man with a sense of ultimatepurpose, a purpose which would not fail him even if he lived to be a millionyears old.Newman ends the Grammar with a passage explaining why, for him, Christianity hasenough ‘converging probabilities’ to constitute a certainty. He speaks of theMessianic prophecies of the Old Testament, the strange history of the Hebrewnation, the power that the early Christians gained from their belief in Christ,and so forth. He concludes ‘ ... either Christianity is from God, or arevelation has not yet been given to us.’6 This, of course, is no final proof.He might as well have said that Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony moved him moreprofoundly than any other work known to man, and concluded that Beethoven musthave been the Messiah foretold by Isaiah. (Newman was, in fact, passionatelyfond of Beethoven’s music.) He is arguing, in the final analysis, from theobservation made by Mencius: ‘Those who follow the part of themselves that isgreat are great men; those who follow the part of themselves that is little arelittle men.’7 Man does not know the extent of his own greatness until he hasbeen introduced to it through some intense spiritual experience, which has theeffect of freeing him from his own stupidity, from his personality. Newman says,in effect, that Christianity has introduced him to the greatest heights he hasknown; consequently, Christianity must be God’s greatest revelation in theworld. Possibly, if Newman had been a Hindu or Buddhist, the concept of Brahmanor Nirvana might have made him aware of new areas of his psyche—perhaps ofhigher areas of his being than Christianity revealed—in which case, his Illativesense would have led him to make an ultimate act of assent to Vedantism orBuddhism.Newman’s significance lies in the fact that a sensitive, highly self-criticaland self-analytical nature was able to find complete balance and self-expressionin accepting Catholic Christianity and returning to the mediaeval Church. Yet atthe same time he went beyond a mere ‘personal’ solution to the Outsider’sproblem. He was aware of the greater problem—the problem of making religionvalid for a civilisation. In the sixth letter of his Tamworth Reading Room, hesays:> People say to me, that it is but a dream to suppose that Christianity should> regain the organic power in human society which once it possessed. I cannot> help that; I never said it could. I am not a politician; I am proposing no> measures, but exposing a fallacy ... do not attempt by philosophy what once> was done by religion. The ascendancy of Faith may be impracticable, but the> reign of Knowledge is incomprehensible. The problem for statesmen of this age> is how to educate the masses, and literature and science cannot give the> solution.8This was written before he became a Catholic. Ten years later, in his famoussermon The Second Spring, he states his feeling that the Catholic Church mayagain become universal, and regain the power which it held in the Middle Ages.This, of course, is still theoretically possible; but in our world of hydrogenbornbs and conflicting ideologies, it no longer seems likely. But whatconclusion does this point to? That Newman was wrong? That the problem of ‘thereign of Knowledge’ will not be solved by a new Christianity? The problem isstill ‘to educate the masses’; but the masses cannot be educated to think likethe Outsider, any more than they can be educated to understand quantummechanics. The whole Outsider theory can be reduced to certain simple religiousfacts: Original Sin, escape from personality, the reality of Will, theexistentialist statements that truth is subjectivity, that there is no suchthing as man, that existence precedes essence. Newman accepts all these facts;but he knew of no way to teach them to a man who would not make the effort tofollow him step by step.In the twentieth century, all the problems which Newman treats are still withus, and our civilisation declines steadily because they remain unsolved. Underthe circumstances, Newman has one thing to teach us. It is the answer suggestedby Rilke in Malte: that the individual who understands the problems must attemptto bear them on his own shoulders. Even if he is completely alone, he must makethe effort. Newman’s example proves how great can be the influence of one man’sattempt to shoulder the problems; his strength became the strength of a wholegeneration. If the twentieth century could produce even a few men of Newman’sstature, the whole course of history might be changed.* Reveries, Section XXX."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN—SØREN KIERKEGAARDEven for a philosopher, Kierkegaard led a singularly uneventful life. In fact,there are really only two striking events in it: the Regina Olsen episode, andthe attacks published on him in The Corsair, a Copenhagen newspaper. He alwayshad enough money to live quietly and write his books; and on the day he went tothe bank to draw out the last of his money, he collapsed in the street and died.He was forty-two at the time.But it is impossible, when reading any biographical study of Kierkegaard, not tofeel that he was a frustrated man. He remained unmarried, but not necessarilythrough choice. In some ways his life reminds one of a short story by Chekhov.There are hints in it that he was sexually incapable, either for psychologicalreasons (like Carlyle), or from some physical cause. He was a skinny, undersizedmisshapen man, lame in one leg. His childhood was a thoroughly bad one from thepoint of view of his mental health; his father was already an old man when hewas born, but a strange, melancholy, strong-willed old man, who was haunted bythe fact that he had once cursed God as a child. He treated Søren like an adult;encouraged his precociousness, stimulated his imagination, and ‘discharged hismelancholy’ on the boy’s head. Kierkegaard’s mother was a maidservant whom hisfather had made pregnant and decided to marry, another fact which preyed on theold man’s conscience.In his youth, Søren is supposed to have led a somewhat disorderly life—though itis hard to guess what the morbidly religious Kierkegaard would have regarded asdisorderly. The prospect of the fortune he would inherit from his father madehim something of a social lion, and he soon gained a reputation as a wit inCopenhagen. He studied at the University of Copenhagen, but without greatdiligence, and quarrelled with his father about his debts. Then, when he wastwenty-five, he had a reconciliation with his father; and a few days later, asudden religious experience which completely converted him from his old way oflife. In his Journal (May 19, 1838) he describes it as a sudden intenseexperience of joy, ‘a heavenly refrain which suddenly breaks in upon ourordinary song, a joy which cools and refreshes like a breeze ... ’1 It wouldseem to be the experience which Nietzsche described happening to him again andagain during the writing of The Gay Science and Zarathustra. With Kierkegaard,it was the rarest of experiences.A few months later, his father died, and left him a considerable fortune. Hereturned to his study of theology at the University, and passed his examinationstwo years later.When his father died, he had been in love for a year. The girl was only fourteenat the time; her name was Regina Olsen. When she was seventeen, he began theactive pursuit of her; a few months later, he proposed to her, and she acceptedhim. But he was too much the tumultuous romantic to accept his conquest andenjoy it; like the narrator of Wuthering Heights, the slightest sign of successin love was enough to make him change his mind. At first, Regina seemed to takethe engagement lightly; she once even said that she had accepted him out ofpity. He set to work to make her take him seriously, and was soon successful;she seemed to surrender herself completely to him and become his slave.Immediately, he began to feel trapped, and decided to break off the engagement.When he sent Regina her ring back, she was frantic, and begged him to change hismind—the worst possible tactic. He withstood her pleas, and those of her family,and went off to Berlin for a holiday. There he wrote most of his first book,Either/Or. This book contains the famous short novel, Diary of the Seducer. Theseducer is called Johannes (i.e. the German form of Juan or Giovanni), and aquotation from Don Giovanni serves as an epigraph: ‘His ruling passion is thefresh young girls.’ The seducer sees a young girl alighting from her carriage,and decides—quite arbitrarily—to seduce her. He finds out that her name isCordelia (Regina’s younger sister was named Cornelia) and turns all his energiesto making her acquaintance, and then to becoming a regular visitor at her house.It would be tiresome to describe in detail the various steps which he takes tobecome engaged to her, then to persuade her to break off the engagement, then toregain her and seduce her. The Diary is a prodigiously long work, and ends withthe hero declaring that now he has possessed her fully, he no longer has anyinterest in her.It is a nasty piece of work—a gloating on the sense of power that the Reginaaffair had given him. It is prolix, and its emotion is rather juvenile. Luckily,Either/Or is not entirely of this quality. There is some penetrating criticismof the age. There is the witty essay called The Rotation Method, with its famousthesis that boredom is the root of all evil (with which most Outsiders wouldagree completely):> The gods were bored, so they created man. Adam was bored because he was alone,> and so Eve was created ... Adam was bored alone, then Adam and Eve were bored> together; then Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel were bored en famille; then the> population of the world increased, and the peoples were bored en masse. To> divert themselves, they conceived the idea of constructing a tower high enough> to reach the heavens. This idea itself is as boring as the tower was high, and> constitutes a terrible proof of how boredom gained the upper hand ... 2He goes on to point out that boredom is not to be combated by frequentdiversion, but by deliberate self-limitation. He recalls how, at school, onecould amuse oneself throughout a tedious lesson by playing with a captive fly ina nutshell. He goes on to outline an Epicurean plan for living: the disciplineof one’s power of remembering and forgetting, and the avoidance of friendship(‘A friend is the superfluous third’) and of marriage. It is obviously the workof a young man who is well pleased with himself; who feels that he has masteredthe circumstances of his life, and gained the power of detachment over them. Itis witty and complacent. An essay on Mozart begins with the words:> Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is> wretched, for it lacks passion ... Men’s thoughts are ... too paltry to be> sinful. For a worm, it might be regarded as a sin to harbour such thoughts,> but not for a being made in the image of God.3The essay is a rhapsody built around Don Giovanni. It ends with Kierkegaarddescribing how the gods offered him any gift he wanted: youth, beauty, longlife, women, and so on. He answered: ‘I choose ... that I may always have thelaugh on my side.’ It was a request that was not granted to Kierkegaard in reallife; later, children would jeer as his stooped, black-clad figure passed themin the street.A second part of Either/Or deals with the ethical life. Kierkegaard ceases to bethe Oscar Wildean aesthete, and speaks of religion and morality. This is themeaning of the title: Either/Or. But it cannot be said that he makes the moralidea as attractive as the aesthetic. Nevertheless, he shows that he, SørenKierkegaard, was not deceived by his own juvenile Epicureanism. But there may beanother reason for the moral element: Either/Or was written to make Reginaunderstand him; it may have been deliberately conceived as illuminating theother side of his nature.Kierkegaard decided that his treatment of Regina had some parallel withAbraham’s treatment of Isaac: he was placing his love of God above his personalfeelings. In Fear and Trembling he wrote of the sacrifice of Isaac, and allowedhimself to indulge in the hope that he might yet have Regina restored to him, asGod had restored Isaac to Abraham. But the real subject of Fear andTrembling—the subject which transcends his relationship with Regina—is thestrange need of the artist and saint to do things that are paradoxical, that arejust not ‘common sense.’ Fear and Trembling could be sub-titled ‘The Defeat ofCommon Sense.’ Like Dostoevsky’s Notes from Under the Floorboards, it is aboutthe irrational, the anti-world impulse. But as a treatise on the irrational, itis certainly not as impressive as Dostoevsky’s book.The Regina problem continued to buzz in his mind. Having written Either/Or andFear and Trembling in the same year, he wrote a novel called Repetition. It isabout a young man who gets engaged, but is tormented by a tendency tomelancholy, and breaks off his engagement by pretending that he has othermistresses. By the time he had written Repetition, Kierkegaard had begun to feelthat maybe he could marry Regina after all. But just then, he received the newsthat Regina had become engaged to someone else. He changed the end of the novel,and made his hero announce his delight that all this trivial human problem hadbeen finally solved, and he could devote all his time and energy to being apoet, a creator. Like Marchbanks at the end of Candida, he evidently felt likecongratulating himself that ‘they did not know the secret in the poet’sheart’—the secret of his superior strength as a poet and philosopher. But thisdoes not ring quite true; one feels that Kierkegaard was trying to compensatehimself for what must have been a crushing disappointment. On the other hand, itis difficult not to feel a certain satisfaction—a sense of ‘It served himright.’ Kierkegaard certainly made far too much song and dance about the Reginaaffair; he made a fool of himself about it, and behaved like a sulky schoolboy.Unfortunately, most of his biographers have solemnly followed his lead, andreferred to it as ‘the deep tragedy of Regina,’ etc. But the simple truth seemsto have been that Kierkegaard was emotionally immature, no matter how mature hemay have been intellectually. His jilting of Regina was not a ‘sacrifice ofIsaac,’ but a piece of schoolboy emotionalism. The three books which came out ofthe affair were Kierkegaard’s attempts to avoid facing the fact that he hadbehaved like a sulky child. He had been brought up in an atmosphere where he wasthoroughly spoiled, but the shock of losing Regina helped to mature hisemotions. The books that follow are far more important than the Regina books.Kierkegaard was thirty when he finally lost Regina. In the remaining twelveyears of his life, he produced such a prodigious volume of work that one wouldguess that he had little else to do but write. First came the PhilosophicalFragments, in which it is apparent that the emotional immaturity has disappearedfrom Kierkegaard’s make-up. He is considering the question of the truth ofChristianity. He cites Socrates, who believed that man contains truth—themystical belief that, in his depths, man is God. Socrates argues this in theMeno, where he makes a slave solve a geometrical problem, and thus shows thatthe slave contained the power to solve it within himself, but was too lazy todevelop it without Socrates’ prompting. Socrates’ inference is that all menwould have the power to become gods, if only they had the strength of Will tomine it out of themselves. In other words, if man is in original sin (as theOutsider tends to believe) his power of redemption lies within himself. Socratesthought of himself as a midwife, whose only job was to bring truth to birth inother people, not to make them a present of it.Kierkegaard states, quite correctly, that to accept Christianity (by which hemeans St. Paul’s version) involves rejecting this view. For in PaulineChristianity, Christ does make man a present of redemption. Kierkegaard thendoes some skilful arguing to justify the Pauline view. He invents a parable of agreat king who wants to marry a humble maiden. But the king, although he is inlove with the girl, is afraid that she will continue to regard him as a monarch,and herself as just a very lucky girl, and that this will completely wreck theirrelation, which depends upon her feeling equality with him. What is he to do? Hecannot raise her to his level, and convince her that she is a queen. But he canlower himself to her level, and convince her that he is a humble lover, as wellas a king. And this, Kierkegaard concludes, is just what God did when He camedown to earth and allowed Himself to be crucified.Kierkegaard does not finally accept this view himself in the PhilosophicalFragments; he presents it as an enviable state of belief that he has not beenable to achieve.A work called The Concept of Anguish followed the Fragments. But it is not oneof Kierkegaard’s most important works: its main thesis is expressed much betterin The Sickness Unto Death, where the word ‘despair’ is almost synonymous with‘angst’: ‘Anguish is the possibility of freedom; only this anguish is ...absolutely educative in that it consumes everything finite, discloses all theillusions of the finite.’4 It is the ‘anguish’ which Nietzsche understood sowell: ‘ ... I doubt whether such pain “improves” us, but I know it deepens us.’5In 1846, the year which saw the publication of his most important work, theConcluding Unscientific Postscript to the Philosophical Fragments, Kierkegaardbecame a Copenhagen celebrity in a way that was not pleasant for him. TheCorsair, a comic paper, took offence at the way in which Kierkegaard had writtenabout a member of its staff, and published a series of satires and cartoons onhim. Either/Or had made him famous in Denmark; now The Corsair made him alaughingstock. Kierkegaard launched a vigorous counteroffensive, and succeededin doing some damage to the journalist who had caused the trouble, but the wholeaffair upset him greatly. The trouble actually arose over a hostile review ofKierkegaard’s Stages On Life’s Way, a successor to Either/Or. In a long sectioncalled ‘Guilty? Not Guilty?’ Kierkegaard again analyses the Regina Olsen affair.Copenhagen naturally felt that this was in rather bad taste, since the story waswell known; and the journalist in question felt that it was a dreary subject totreat at such length, anyway. No doubt he was right. At all events, The Corsairattacks seemed to cure Kierkegaard of his adolescent tendency to brood on hisaffair with Regina.The Unscientific Postscript is a gigantic volume, and it is as obscure andunreadable as most of Kierkegaard’s philosophic ventures. Nevertheless, in itseight hundred long-winded pages some extremely important ideas are formulated.Kierkegaard repeats the question: What does it mean to be a Christian? Hegel, itwill be remembered, found a convenient little niche for Christianity in hisSystem. It was this element in Hegel that Kierkegaard hated most. For him,religion was the final, most important element of man’s spiritual life; not justa part of a great philosophical synthesis, to be given a condescending pat onthe head like a well-behaved schoolboy.The idea developed in the Postscript is that truth is not a formula or a system.Truth is the spiritual intensity of the man who apprehends it. ‘Truth issubjectivity.’ Kierkegaard was attacking Hegel because he seemed to be a greattop-heavy intellect, a bloodless halfman. For Kierkegaard, Hegel was not ahalf-man because he lacked the sex impulse or any physical intensity (theindictment which D. H. Lawrence or Walt Whitman would have pinned on him); hewas a half-man because—as Kierkegaard expressed it in Either/Or—he ‘lackedpassion.’ And passion, for Kierkegaard, meant religious passion: the Outsider’scraving for a sense of purpose. In the Postscript Kierkegaard launched hisattack on ‘mere intellect,’ and contrasted the logical approach with theexistential approach. It was the first use of the word existentialism in moderntimes. In the conclusion of the Postscript, Kierkegaard sums up: a man might bea Christian because he accepts certain doctrines (the Protestant way), orbecause he is baptised (the Catholic way), or he might be a Christian because ofthe intensity with which he feels the truth of the New Testament. This isKierkegaard’s way. In a later book, Training in Christianity, he goes evenfurther, and says that true Christianity means living as if you were one of thetwelve apostles.Kierkegaard wrote many more books in the remaining nine years of his life, butthere would be no point in referring to them all here. (I have already omittedreference to several of his volumes—mostly sermons and ‘edifying discourses.’)Only one of them is of great importance for the present purpose: the slim volumecalled The Sickness Unto Death. This is crucial because it formulates one ideawhich lies at the bottom of the whole Outsider problem. That idea, asKierkegaard states it, is this: Every human existence that does not know itselfas spirit is in despair. And what is even more important, a man who is indespair need not know that he is in despair. He may think himself perfectlyhappy.This is not really such a startling concept as it sounds. Pascal talked aboutthe ‘misery’ of man instead of ‘despair,’ but he emphasised that the men whoseek most feverishly after pleasure—the men who look as if they are mosthappy—are actually the most deeply miserable.This idea of Kierkegaard’s—that a man’s despair may be unknown to him—is ofinestimable importance in the study of the Outsider. For the retort of theInsider who dislikes being told that he ought to be an Outsider is: Let mealone; I’m happy enough. His challenge tends to be: If I’m happy as an Insider,can you give me a single good reason why I should be an Outsider? ForKierkegaard, this is tantamount to saying: If I am suffering from a deadlydisease without knowing it, can you give me any good reason for being healthy?He actually states that a sense of fundamental uncertainty, of chaos, is commonto all men: but in some it is conscious, in some, unconscious. The Outsider isthe man in whom it is conscious. The sense of chaos, despair, lies in theInsider too, but he is not conscious of it. He prefers to live in thecomfortable daylight, pretending that the whole universe is as neatly ordered ashis own little corner of it. In The Sickness Unto Death, Kierkegaard comes tothe conclusion that I restated in the first chapter of The Outsider: TheOutsider is the man who has faced chaos. The Insider is the man who blindshimself to it.Kierkegaard, of course, knows nothing of these labels ‘Outsider’ and ‘Insider.’In his own terminology, the true Christian is the man who has faced his owndespair, and has defeated it by an act of faith. I only wish to draw attentionto the fact that, by ‘Outsider,’ I mean precisely what Kierkegaard meant by thereligious man.The Sickness Unto Death was received, like most of Kierkegaard’s major works,with complete incomprehension: an incomprehension that was partly his own fault,for in spite of his dislike of Hegel, he has one irritating quality in commonwith him, a most obscure and prolix literary style. It is true that his style isnot always obscure; but he usually reserves his wit and clarity for his leastimportant works. His last work, the Attack Upon ‘Christendom’, has an aphoristicbrilliance worthy of Nietzsche, but serving no other purpose than to attack theProtestant Church of Denmark.The Attack was published in a series of pamphlets. Its original occasion hadbeen a sermon preached by Bishop Martensen on his predecessor, Bishop Mynster.Mynster had been an unusually good bishop, but for some reason, Martensen’sgenerous praise of him excited Kierkegaard to fury. He did not actually go asfar as Shaw (in the preface to Androcles and the Lion) and assert that theChristian Church had chosen Barabbas; but he certainly felt that the Church wasnot Christian in the sense in which he understood Christianity. The Attackcontains some of Kierkegaard’s most amusing and readable writing—he was a masterof satire when he chose to be. The pamphlets of which it is composed caused asensation when they were published in 1854 and 1855. But nine months after theyfirst appeared, Kierkegaard collapsed in the street when returning from the bankwith the last of his money. Two months later, he died in hospital of a vaguelydiagnosed malady. He himself told his doctors that the real illness waspsychological. He refused to receive the sacrament from the hands of a priest,declaring that only a layman was worthy to administer it. At his funeral,students formed a guard of honour, and there was a riot which was checked in itsearly stages; there was also a last-minute outburst at his graveside from asympathiser who accused the Church of hypocrisy in claiming the rebel who haddenounced it.For nearly half a century after his death, Kierkegaard remained unknown outsideDenmark. Then, slowly, his reputation filtered through to other Europeancountries, and his writings were translated into French and German. The resultwas the Continental Existentialist movement; Heidegger, its major Germanexponent, laid great emphasis on the idea of death, and the concept ofunconscious despair. When Sartre and Camus called themselvesExistentialists—Sartre more or less following Heidegger, Camus following a lineof his own derived from Kierkegaard’s idea of ‘the absurd’ in Fear andTrembling—Kierkegaard’s name began to be bandied around among intellectuals inthe same way that the names of Nietzsche and Bergson had been at the beginningof the century.Now that Existentialism is ceasing to be a subject of such heated discussion, itis perhaps time to recognise that Kierkegaard may have been overrated. Nietzscheonce said that he owed his penetration as a thinker to the fact that he neverwasted his time on imaginary problems or pseudo problems. Kierkegaard cannotmake the same boast. He wasted a great deal of his time by exaggerating hispersonal problems out of all proportion. He also lacked Nietzsche’s healthyscepticism and his impatience with organised religion. It is interesting towonder where Kierkegaard would have found himself if he had lived twenty yearslonger; his rejection of the Church might have led to some constructive results.As it is, the final judgement on him is likely to run: A man of superbintellect, and great spiritual strength, but a lopsided, tragic figure."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT—BERNARD SHAWIn writing about Shaw, it is time to be frankly personal, for my attitudetowards Shaw aroused more comment and opposition than any other point in TheOutsider. It is my own opinion that Shaw’s reputation will increase with time,until it is seen that his position in relation to Western thought is asimportant as that of Augustine or Aquinas to mediaeval thought. For me, theOutsider is the symbol of the whole problem of Western civilisation in the pastfive centuries of ‘Faustian culture.’ Shaw once said that he had solved everymajor problem of our civilisation, and that people still go on propounding themas if they are unsolved. This seems to me to be true. Shaw touched on theOutsider problem at almost every point, and came closer to providing a completesolution than any other thinker. It is his relation to the Outsider that I wishto make clear in the following chapter. The space is, of course, inadequate; andyet it is necessary that Shaw should be treated in this context—in relation toNewman, Law, Kierkegaard. Only in this way can his full significance be seen.The impact which Shaw made on the generation who grew up between 1900 and 1920is irrelevant; it was a mere impact of new ideas, and has nothing to do withShaw’s true stature any more than Goethe’s Sturm und Drang period has anythingto do with his. Ideas are fashionable, and then become unfashionable, and thisis unimportant; it matters as little as that the headlines of the newspaperschange every day. The standards by which we judge a Shakespeare or Dante are thereal and important standards. Unfortunately, these do not apply to Shaw, either.Neither do the standards that apply to Aristotle or Hume as revolutionaries ofthought. Shaw is far more difficult to classify, and I believe that it is thiswhich explains the present incomprehension and underrating of his work. Shawbelongs to a rare class of men which also includes Plato and Goethe: in theprofoundest sense of the word, he is an existentialist thinker. Andexistentialism begins with the Outsider, and ends ... no one knows where; butits road lies through religion. Religion is not the end; it is only a rest-houseon the way.In saying that Plato, Goethe and Shaw were existentialists I mean that all threewere thinkers for whom thought and life are inseparable. Now the only other typeof man for whom thought and life are inseparable is the artist: his art is theresult of the impact of life on his sensibility. But normally he spends all histime acting as a good recording-machine; his aim is usually to keep the‘receiving’ surface of his sensibility as impressionable as possible. This iswhat Keats meant when he talked of ‘negative capability’ as the most importantquality of a poet. When the artist begins to record the impact of life on hissensibility, he has begun thinking: even if his formula for art is as simple asMonet’s: ‘An eye, a brush.’ Thinking is a movement of analysis, and an artistcould not create unless he analysed. But an artist is rarely outstanding forboth his sensibility and his powers of analysis. He usually excels in one fieldor the other, as a Shakespeare or a Kant, a Dante or a Hegel.But occasionally there are men who go beyond the mere artist or thinker. Theartist fails to cultivate his analytical faculty; the thinker fails to cultivatehis sensibility. But certain thinkers have believed that life itself is thestuff of philosophy—the living, raw impressions which the artist puts into hisart. They do not believe that the artist’s passive acceptance of hisexperience—the ‘negative capability’—is the sole necessity. But neither do theybelieve that the thinker’s ability to roll the universe into a (theoretical)ball is of primary importance. Philosophy should not be built with thoughts andanalyses, any more than houses should be built with cards; it should be builtout of living experience. Plato is fascinated by mathematics, but he is equallyinterested in the mind of Socrates or Protagoras, and the psychology of Miletusand Xanthippe. He is, in fact, one of the earliest novelists in history. Thesame is true of Goethe; he is known to posterity as poet and lover, yet he hadthe restless analytical mind of a philosopher and scientist. Rudolf Steinerperformed an invaluable service in editing Goethe’s philosophical and scientificworks, and revealing that Goethe the poet has obscured Goethe the philosopherfrom posterity.Goethe revived one great concept that was already present in Plato: the idea ofBildung, or education. Not academic education, but the real education in livingthat makes for maturity: the education of the sage and saint. Wilhelm Meister isabout a young man learning from his living experience. And this is of obviousimportance to the Outsider, whose chief observation about human beings is thatthey never learn from experience; Evan Strowde’s indictment: ‘Now take away mylife, O Lord, for I am no better than my fathers.’But it is an immense and perplexing problem. For sensitivity—essential tomaturing—means relaxing the will, making the personality transparent, becomingcompletely receptive; and analysis means essentially reacting, using the will,strengthening the personality. Which means that a man who wishes to developwithout cramping his faculties must achieve complete control of this Caliban,whom Blake called the spectre. There is an unending warfare with this spectre;the spectre is the Enemy. Blake wrote:> Each Man is in his Spectre’s power> > Untill the arrival of that hour,> > When his Humanity awake> > And cast his own Spectre into the Lake.1The ideally great existentialist, then, would have the ability to use his willpower in analysis, and yet at a moment’s notice to become completely negative,transparent and receptive. There would, that is to say, be completeself-control. And here we see that the concept of existentialism involvesinevitably the idea of self-discipline and self-transformation—the religiousidea. For the existentialist, then, thought can never be ‘abstract’; it isalways involved in a concrete situation. He never treats the universe as if hewere sitting apart from it all, in a celestial armchair, ‘logicising’ about it.When the field of his own immediate being is no longer in question, he ceases tothink and again becomes the receptive artist-poet. For the existentialist, theonly form of abstract thought which is not unutterable nonsense is mathematics,and that is because mathematics is the dumbbell exercise of the existentialist,his mental gymnasium. But essentially, existentialism is not the building of anintellectual system. It is the building of an insight, a building of manyinsights into a total vision, an attempt to extend the consciousness,* to extendthe sphere of the living being into the unliving. It is made of moments ofinsight of the kind that come to the poet. (It is the essence of Eliot’s praiseof Donne in his essay on the Metaphysical poets: ‘A thought to Donne was anexperience ... When a poet’s mind is perfectly equipped for its work, it isconstantly amalgamating disparate experience; the ordinary man’s experience ischaotic, irregular, fragmentary.’2) Yeats knew many such moments. In speaking ofa waterfall, he writes:> I would have touched it like a child> > But knew my finger could but have touched> > Cold stone and water. I grew wild,> > Even accusing Heaven because> > It had set down among its laws:> > Nothing that we love over-much> > Is ponderable to our touch.3Here a physical experience has been translated into thought in a manner which isfar more than ruminating: it is the immediate expression of an insight. Thepoetry of Rupert Brooke is full of this kind of insight. For instance, in thelines:> and I should find> > Soon in the silence the hidden key> > Of all that had hurt and puzzled me—4the poetic experience—the ‘negative capability’—is conceived as an indirectmeans of conquering his experience. It is necessary to say all this to makeclear what I mean by ‘existentialist’—which is the indispensable preliminary tospeaking about Shaw. We have been thinking about Shaw for so long as a politicalthinker or a propagandist-playwright that a major engineering operation isrequired if we are to overthrow irrelevant standards, and begin judging himwithout prejudice.To summarise: the existentialist is the artist-philosopher, and his naturalmedium is the Bildungsroman: the novel or play which is about the maturing ofits central character through the impact of his experience. Examples of this areWilhelm Meister, The Brothers Karamazov, Meredith’s Ordeal of Richard Feverel,Mann’s Magic Mountain, Hesse’s Demian, Sartre’s Chemins de la Liberté,Hemingway’s Farewell to Arms, Joyce’s Portrait, Shaw’s Immaturity. I have lumpedthe major with the minor here to emphasise the breadth of this category. Let mefinish by dogmatising: In the twentieth century, the only serious form ofliterary art is the Bildungsroman.Half of Shaw’s greatness is symbolised by his love of Mozart. In Mozart, for allhis depth, there are no self-conscious explorations of the tortured mind, andfor all his vision, it never overwhelms the listener as if with a sudden andstartling revelation. In his work, it is life that is glorified, life as such,without distinction between its surface and its depth. In The Magic Flute, thelast opera, written after years of disappointment and suffering, he makes lifeseem transient and yet permanent; it would seem almost as if he were saying:Life needs no deeper meanings to make it beautiful and eternal; for all itstorture and uncertainty, it is divine. The opera is ‘lighter’ and more delicate,and yet more profound, than anything Mozart had written before.This vision of life is the true poet’s vision: it is the vision of Keats andShakespeare and Villon and Synge; it glorifies life without any attempt to find‘reasons.’This vision is found in the two greatest writers of the early part of ourcentury: Shaw and Wells. (It is also found in Chesterton and Belloc, and it isby recognising how little these latter achieved in comparison with Shaw andWells that one realises how dangerous this capacity can be in the hands of anon-thinker.) It is the sheer vital energy, the love of life in all itsmanifestations, which makes Shaw and Wells so attractive. They had about themwhat Chesterton called ‘a wild gaiety.’ And in Shaw, this gaiety is closelyconnected with the influence of Mozart. One of Shaw’s earliest musicalexperiences was to see Don Giovanni. He was a romantic and imaginative boy, andDon Giovanni contributed to forming his picture of what adulthood ought to be.The Don adores life and its perpetually renewed manifestations so much that hechanges his mistress every other day (or even more frequently, if Leporello’scatalogue song is accurate). Naturally, this requires considerableheartlessness. The Don is not shown as a particularly cruel or unpleasant man;consequently, there must be some remorse involved in breaking off an enjoyablehuman relationship for the benefit of another; yet his love of change is sogreat that he apparently cultivates this callousness in himself. His excuse is adelight in women which is as promiscuous as a bee’s delight in flowers. In orderto indulge this delight to the full, he has become completely ‘heartless’; tokeep his aesthetic delight in women separated from his human interest in them.Inhumanity is a condition of delight.No doubt this made a deep impression on a romantic boy—especially as the Don isrepresented as having all the romantic virtues except fidelity: courage, wit,courtliness, and an irresistible attractiveness to women. The philosophy of DonGiovanni is the philosophy of Kierkegaard’s seducer; but it also has elements ofthe philosophy of Plato and the Upanishads: that the fullest enjoyment of lifedemands complete non-attachment. In his odd way, Don Giovanni is genuinelynon-attached.Beyond doubt, the young Shaw was the complete romantic. His home life wasadmirably suited to his development in this directions his parents believed inletting him alone, and there was no attempt to impose a Victorian discipline. Weknow too little about Shaw’s childhood: and yet he is the very man of genius whoshould have written a full account of it, like Tolstoy’s great book, for theShaw we know is a mature Shaw, the skilled controversialist, the lucid reasoner,and no man could have developed such powers without a long period of agonisingimmaturity. His very strength makes him unpopular and remote; he showedpenetrating insight into this in Back to Methuselah, where he quotes Wells’sparable The Food of the Gods, in which a chemical food makes some people grow totremendous size, and the rest of the human race develops a passionate hatred ofthe giants and tries to destroy them. If Shaw had revealed more of his ownweakness, as Joyce and Gide did, he might have had more defenders today.But we know that Shaw was more fond of art than of life: that he wandered aroundthe Dublin art galleries, went to the theatres and the opera whenever he had theopportunity, and was deeply impressed by Mozart’s Don Giovanni and Gounod’sFaust (in which he admired Mephistopheles for his arched eyebrows—a feature hehimself was later to develop). And we know that he detested Dublin as much asthe young James Joyce was to detest it thirty years later. In the preface toImmaturity, he says of Ulysses:> James Joyce ... has described with a fidelity so ruthless that the book is> hardly bearable, the life that Dublin offers to its young men ... No doubt it> is much like the life of young men everywhere in modern urban civilisation. A> certain flippant futile derision and belittlement that confuses the noble and> serious with the base and ludicrous seems to me peculiar to Dublin; but I> suppose that is because my only personal experience of that phase of youth was> a Dublin experience; for when I left my native city I left that phase behind> me, and associated no more with men of my age until, after about eight years> of solitude in this respect, I was drawn into the Socialist revival of the> early eighties, among Englishmen intensely serious, and burning with> indignation at very real and fundamental evils that affected all the world ...> 5So, in fact, when Shaw left Dublin at twenty—having been a highly efficient andsuccessful clerk for six years—he plunged into a strange city—London—and intorelative solitude. And as he himself says in the same preface, he became anOutsider:> When I had to come out of the realm of imagination into that of actuality I> was still uncomfortable. I was outside society, outside politics, outside> sport, outside the Church. If the term had been invented then I should have> been called the Complete Outsider.6 *Shaw was the most basic type of Outsider, the romantic Outsider. ‘When I had tocome out of the realm of imagination into that of actuality ... ’: it is theproblem of Hanno Buddenbrooks that Thomas Mann described in his first novel. Andin John Bull’s Other Island, Shaw puts his hatred of Dublin into Doyle’s mouth:> And all the while there goes on a horrible, senseless, mischievous laughter.> When youre young, you exchange drinks with other young men; and you exchange> vile stories with them; and as youre too futile to be able to help or cheer> them, you chaff and sneer and taunt them for not doing the things you darent> do yourself. And all the time you laugh! laugh! laugh! eternal derision,> eternal envy, eternal folly, eternal fouling and staining and degrading,> until, when you come at last to a country where men take a question seriously> and give a serious answer to it, you deride them for having no sense of humor,> and plume yourself on your own worthlessness as if it made you better than> them.7Shaw wrote this nearly thirty years after he had left Dublin; the clearness withwhich he remembers the humiliation of being sneered at for being ‘too serious’makes it apparent that it cut deep. The whole meaning of this paragraph takes usback to the problems I examined in the second chapter of The Outsider, inwriting about Camus’s L’Etranger and Hemingway’s Soldier’s Home. Krebs, thesoldier who comes home from the war, remembers glimpses of the heroic state ofmind when ‘you did the one thing, the only thing’ with calm and discipline, andhates the dullness of his home town where the men play pool, and hang aroundtelling stories; he hates it because, having glimpsed a higher intensity ofliving, he now longs for the heroic and detests the trivial. Strowde inGranville-Barker’s play threw away a political career because he had glimpsedthis higher intensity, and no longer had patience with politicians. It is aromantic attitude—Yeats caught it perfectly in ‘The Man Who Dreamed ofFaeryland’ and ‘Fergus and the Druid.’ It is not actually a distaste for living;it is only a distaste for the dilute, gritty soup which gets fed to us under thename of ‘living’ in the modern world. In Peer Gynt, Ibsen showed his romanticyoung man prepared to accept the Troll King’s ugly daughter as a ravishingprincess, and the pig he rides on as a magnificent white charger, rather thanface the dreary reality. It is a longing for the heroic, for a greaterseriousness of life than ordinary human beings know about. And when a man hasthis appetite for seriousness, and cannot see it reflected in any of the humanbeings he knows, he must either submit to their standards and forget his dreams,or deliberately cut himself off from them—make himself an Outsider—until he hasfound a way of thinking and living that gives him scope for his deeperseriousness. Works of imagination will inspire him—especially works aboutambitious young men struggling to escape their circumstances, like Stendhal’s LeRouge et le noir or Joyce’s Portrait. It is this longing for the heroic thatmakes the Outsider; and his greatest enemy is ‘nausea’: discouragement, boredom,and the pettiness of so much modern life.A romantic distaste for Dublin and a craving for seriousness kept Shaw insolitude for many years. In this solitude, his main solace seems to have been inthe realm of imagination: in music, literature, art. On first coming to London,he went to see Carmen again and again; he soaked himself in Shakespeare andDickens; he became as familiar with the London art galleries as he had been withthe Dublin ones. And he also discovered Wagner.Wagner’s work is the apotheosis of the heroic ideal. From Rienzi to Parsifal,heroes occupy the centre of his stage. In his greatest and most significantwork, The Ring, Wotan (symbolising the intellectual leader of men), brings acurse on the gods, which can only be removed by the rise of a higher type of manthan the intellectual leader—the hero, Siegfried. It is hardly surprising thatthe young Shaw at once became ‘the perfect Wagnerite.’Shaw’s training in being an Outsider was unusually long and complete; for yearshe had no field of action, nothing to occupy his attention except art. He waslucky enough not to have to work; like all true artists, he hated work, andrefused to do any, allowing his family to supply his meals and a roof, andspending his days at the British Museum writing his five novels. In these eightyears, he developed an immense romantic appetite for heroic achievement, andacquired vast erudition in the course of his long quest to find satisfaction inthe realm of literature. The novels are all poor, but it is not easy to say why;mainly, perhaps, because Shaw had no deep interest in their central characters.The hero of Immaturity is a sort of self-portrait, but it is a curiouslyobjective, unromantic self-portrait, with no appreciable element of self-pity ordramatisation; and the hero’s name is—Smith! Before the end of the firstchapter, Smith, newly arrived in London, has met an attractive girl namedHarriet; but no romance develops; instead, he teaches her French. At the end ofthe book, Smith is as celibate as at the beginning. Harriet marries someoneelse. Smith’s only achievement is to become a highly efficient privatesecretary. The interest in the novel has centred around Harriet and her painterhusband as much as around Smith.It would, of course, be a mistake to expect Shaw to have written his ownPortrait of the Artist in the seventies of the last century; Joyce was unborn,and Shaw’s reading had been limited to Dickens and Charles Lever. His tendencywas naturally to try to tell a story, and to ignore psychological analyses.In his next three novels, there is not even the suggestion of a self-portrait.The Irrational Knot is about a hard-headed engineer who marries a ‘lady’ butfinds the insipidity of the life she expects to lead intolerable. Love Among theArtists has a composer, Owen Jack, as its central figure; he has a pock-markedface and the waspish temperament of a Beethoven, but a whole gallery of lesserfigures get an equal share of the author’s attention, and the result is notabsorbing. Cashel Byron’s Profession is about a young gentleman who runs awayfrom school and becomes a prizefighter; then falls in love with a bluestockingnamed Lady Lydia Carew, whom he finally marries. The various complications thatmake the plot of the novel are weakly contrived, and there is an uncomfortablefeeling that the novelist does not know exactly what he’s about.An Unsocial Socialist is undoubtedly the best of the five novels. Shaw wastwenty-seven when he finished it, and the central character has strong elementsof self-portraiture. Here, for the first time, Shaw’s innate romanticism,bequeathed him by Mozart, appears with its own peculiar identity. The book’soriginal title was The Heartless Man. Trefusis is heartless—as heartless as DonGiovanni—but he has also grown beyond the stage of finding any excitement in aseries of sexual intrigues. He is thoroughly romantic, but his romanticism isrevolted by the reality of the male-female relation. When the book opens, he hasdeserted his newly married wife, leaving her a note telling her that she isravishingly beautiful and sensually satisfying, but that the atmosphere ofbilling and cooing and making love is stifling him. Shaw then involves him in ahilarious and highly improbable adventure in a girls’ school. It is all asinvolved and confusing as Immaturity, but this time, the character of Trefusisgives it unity and holds one’s interest. He is shown as having Don Giovanni’sattractiveness to women, but preferring socialism. At the slightest provocation,he makes long speeches about the oppression of the working classes. It is hiscombination of romanticism and intellectualism that makes him heartless; hefinds the reality of human relations uninteresting by comparison.The five novels did not find a publisher, although Cashel Byron was later a fairsuccess. An Unsocial Socialist was published in a small monthly magazine; it hadno success, but made Shaw known to William Morris, at whose house Shaw became afrequent visitor. For many years he had been interested in socialism, and hadread Marx’s Capital in the Museum. In the year after he wrote An UnsocialSocialist, he joined the Fabian Society, and immediately became one of itsmoving forces, speaking on street corners and in Hyde Park, and writingpamphlets. He had been speaking in public since he was twenty-three, when hestood up at the meeting of the ‘Zetetical Society,’ tense with nervousness, andopposed the speaker. He always managed to cover his timidity with an air ofself-confidence which often aroused violent hostility. ‘ ... I had an unpleasanttrick of contradicting everyone from whom I thought I could learn anything inorder to draw him out and enable me to pick his brains ... I think I must haveimpressed many amiable persons as an extremely disagreeable and undesirableyoung man.’ 8 When he was twenty-six, he fell in love with one of his mother’ssinging pupils, a nurse, but the affair came to nothing. He was still a virginat twenty-nine, when finally another of his mother’s pupils decided to seducehim, and met with no objection. Shaw then proceeded to make up for lost time,and had a series of affairs which continued until he married fifteen yearslater. The Immaturity preface contains a delightful portrait of the Shaw of thepre-Fabian period:> Clever sympathetic women might divine at a glance that I was mortally shy; but> people who could not see through my skin, and who were accustomed to respect,> and even veneration, from the young, may well have found me insufferable,> aggressive and impudent. When a young man has achieved nothing and is doing> nothing, and when he is obviously so poor that he ought to be doing something> very energetically, it is rather trying to find him assuming an authority in> conversation, and an equality in terms, which only conspicuous success and> distinguished ability could make becoming. Yet this is what is done, quite> unconsciously, by young persons who have in them the potentiality of such> success and ability ...> > The truth is that all men are in a false position in society until they have> realised their possibilities, and imposed them on their neighbors. They are> tormented by a continual shortcoming in themselves; yet they irritate others> by a continual overweening. This discord can be resolved by acknowledged> success or failure only: everyone is ill at ease until he has found his> natural place, whether it be above or below his birthplace ... Besides, this> finding of one’s place may be made very puzzling by the fact that there is no> place in ordinary society for extraordinary individuals ... 9The young Shaw was, emphatically, an Outsider, and what he has described is theposition of every young man of genius before he has convinced himself or anyoneelse of his genius. There is no place in society for the extraordinaryindividuals, and neither should there be; all their power and importance lies intheir being outside society. It is a pity that Shaw knew nothing of the equallygreat problem—Scott Fitzgerald’s problem—of sudden overwhelming success, and thecurious way in which success makes for a quite different kind of isolation inmodern society.I began The Outsider by denying that the Outsider is simply the misunderstoodman of genius. This is true in the sense that genius means some extraordinaryability to create. Even a stupid and un-talented man—like Barbusse’shole-in-corner man—may be made into an Outsider by some great suffering whichcuts him off from his fellow human beings. But such suffering makes for thedevelopment of an intelligence which is halfway towards genius; so I mustqualify my statement by an admission that the Outsider problem and the problemof genius striving for self-expression are closely connected. And in theImmaturity preface, the Outsider is simply the frustrated man of genius—of thesame type as the angry and frustrated young man whom James Dean has madefashionable in the ’fifties.But Shaw’s interest in the Outsider theme was not limited to thefrustrated-genius type. I have already spoken of Keegan, in John Bull’s OtherIsland, who is an Outsider because of his Swiftian loathing of human cruelty andfolly. Keegan was a late development, and there are many stages of the Outsiderbetween Trefusis, the Heartless Man, and Keegan’s almost Buddhist attitude.(There are so many, in fact, that I might well have written a book about theOutsider in Shaw, instead of tracing Outsiders from Barbusse to Ramakrishna andHulme.)Trefusis is Shaw’s first Outsider, and he is an Outsider in the simple sense ofbeing a rebel against the established order. He is also a symbol of Shaw’srevolt against Victorian sentimentality, and the nineteenth-century emphasis on‘humanity’ (the inevitable outcome of its materialism and agnosticism). He isheartless because he has the Outsider’s consuming desire for seriousness ofpurpose, and a consequent horror of human entanglements. His heartlessness is ofthe same origin as that of St. John of the Cross or Eckhart. But his socialismdoes not make him simply an ‘angry young man’; he has too much faith in thepower of his enthusiasm, and he also has a sense of humour. He lusts for purposeand direction, but this does not turn him into a monk; there is a strong elementof Mozart-ian love of the world in his make-up. All this becomes even moreapparent in a short story which Shaw wrote a few years later called Don GiovanniExplains. In this story, a young girl returning from a performance of DonGiovanni meets the ghost of the Don on the train; he then tells her the truestory of his life: the romanticism that made him into a lover, and thedisillusion that made him turn away from sex—unfortunately at a time when hislegend had made him so attractive to women that he spent his time trying toescape advances from them. The story of Mozart’s opera is retold, but this timethe Don is not shown as a rake, but as a fastidious artist and thinker with astrong leaning to asceticism. In the Killing for Sport preface, Shaw has thesentence: ‘It all comes back to ... appetite for fruitful activity and a highquality of life,’10 (which makes the basis of his objection to killing animals).This phrase explains the whole aim of Shaw’s life and work. Differently worded,it is the Outsider’s question of how to live as fully as possible, or Eliot’squestion: ‘Where is the Life we have lost in living?’ Writing about Hamlet in1897, Shaw said:> Hamlet is not a man in whom ‘common humanity’ is raised by great vital energy> to a heroic pitch ... On the contrary, he is a man in whom the common personal> passions are so superseded by wider and rarer interests, and so discouraged by> a degree of critical self-consciousness which makes the practical efficiency> of the instinctive man ... impossible to him, that he finds the duties> dictated by conventional revenge and ambition as disagreeable a burden as> commerce is to a poet.11This is as penetrating an analysis of the Outsider as anyone could ask: ‘...discouraged by a degree of critical self-consciousness ... this is T. E.Lawrence and Nietzsche. But Shaw’s analysis goes even deeper than this; he goeson to say:> And, indeed, there is a sense in which Hamlet is insane; for he trips over the> mistake which lies on the threshold of intellectual self-consciousness: that> of bringing life to utilitarian or Hedonistic tests, thus treating it as a> means instead of an end. Because Polonius is ‘a foolish prating knave,’> because Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are snobs, he kills them as remorselessly> as he might kill a flea ... anticipating ... the whole course of the> intellectual history of Western Europe ... 12Shaw has diagnosed the Outsider’s torment as the inevitable period ofmaladjustment on the threshold of intellectual consciousness; and he has alsoseen beyond the fascist error—the error attributed (quite mistakenly) toNietzsche, and about which Dostoevsky wrote in Crime and Punishment: that the‘masters’—the Outsiders—should have power of life and death over the slaves. Inthe Postscript to Back to Methuselah (1944) he repeats his earlier diagnosis ofHamlet, and adds ‘Had Shakespeare plumbed his play to the bottom, he wouldhardly have allowed Hamlet to send Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to their death... ’13In his first critical book, The Quintessence of Ibsenism, written after he hadbeen a journalist and reviewer for ten years, Shaw has already grasped his owntask as a writer: to attempt to restore unity to the conception of nature. Inhis examination of Ibsen’s Emperor and Galilean, he attacks Darwinism andmaterialism, and quotes Butler’s dictum that Darwin had ‘banished mind from theuniverse.’ The full significance of this would not be understood until Heideggerin Germany and Sartre in France began the task of trying to ‘restore mind to theuniverse.’ Julian the Apostate tries to restore paganism, because he feels thatthe Christian ideal is decadent. But he tries to impose paganism by force, andfails. Maximus the Mystic, the strange old man who inspires Julian, predictsthat both Emperor and Galilean shall be swallowed up by something that shallsupersede both:> Both shall succumb; but you shall not therefore perish. Does not the child> succumb in the youth and the youth in the man: yet neither child nor youth> perishes. You know I have never approved of your policy as emperor. You have> tried to make the youth a child again. The empire of the flesh is fallen a> prey to the empire of the spirit. But the empire of the spirit is not final,> any more than the youth is. You have tried to hinder the youth from growing:> from becoming a man. Oh fool, who have drawn your sword against that which is> to be: against the third empire ... 14It is the truth which T. E. Hulme recognised: that although mediaeval religiongave way to humanism, the answer is not simply to put back the clock. ForWestern civilisation, the Church was the first empire—an empire of blind faith.It was replaced by an empire of free thought. One type of man alone in ourcivilisation has recognised that free thought leads back to religion—if it isfree enough and ranges far enough: the Outsider. Unfortunately, neither Shaw norIbsen recognised that civilisations smash after the second empire. The problemof the third empire still stands, immense and unsolved: the problem of how tomake our whole civilisation think like the Outsider.But this is to anticipate the ideas of the later Shaw. In the eighteen-nineties,Shaw had recognised that life is a lust for wider and deeper self-consciousness,and that the Outsider is a man standing in bewilderment between two worlds. Butwhen he began writing plays, he made no attempt to dramatise Outsider problems.Widowers’ Houses, his first play, was produced in 1892; its message iscompletely socialistic, although, as with all Shaw’s plays, the dialogue is sovigorous that it is preposterous to try to dismiss it as ‘a socialist tract.’His second play, The Philanderer, returns to the Don Giovanni problem; its hero,Charteris, has much in common with Trefusis, except that he is altogether moreamiable and more susceptible to women. His complaint is that of Shaw’s DonGiovanni in the short story: ‘ ... whose fault is it that half the women I speakto fall in love with me?’15The Philanderer is an attempt to depict a rising generation at the end of thelast century, and as such has something in common with Michael Arlen’s The GreenHat and John Osborne’s Look Back in Anger. But the Ibsenite young people arerather dreary; the plot is as complicated as Love Among the Artists, and theover-all effect is one of confusion. But this is the last appearance in Shaw’swork of such an effect; all his subsequent plays have a firm sense of direction.A number of lighter plays were written during the next ten years. Mrs Warren’sProfession, in spite of its subject—the white-slave trade—is witty and amusing.Arms and the Man makes fun of nationalism and patriotism; it is Shaw at his bestin his anti-sentimental vein, but whereas other opponents of the army have ragedand sneered about it, Shaw makes fun of it with the cool superiority of a manwho has more serious things to occupy his mind.The Man of Destiny introduces two elements into Shaw that were to appear againand again; one good, one bad. The good one is his tendency to portray greatmen—Napoleon in this case—as good-tempered and humorous; the bad one is histendency to exaggerate the stupidity of some of his characters until they becomealmost village idiots. In this play it is a young lieutenant; his kind ofimbecility reappears many times in the later plays, and gives the reader anirritated feeling that he is being underrated.Candida is altogether the most important play of this period; it is a parallelstudy in an Outsider and an Insider. The Insider is a socialist clergyman,witty, urbane, tolerant; the Outsider, a young poet, uncertain of himself in allsocial relations, but supremely certain of his ideas as a poet. When the poettells Morell, the clergyman, that he is in love with his his wife Candida,Morell kindly warns him that he is making a fool of himself, and Marchbankslaunches a superb attack:> Oh, do you think I dont know all that? Do you think that the things that> people make fools of themselves about are any less real and true than the> things they behave sensibly about? They are more true: they are the only> things that are true. You are very calm and sensible and moderate with me> because you can see that I am a fool about your wife; just as no doubt that> old man who was here just now is very wise over your Socialism, because he> sees that you are a fool about it. Does that prove you wrong? Does your> complacent superiority to me prove that I am wrong?16This magnificent scene is more than an Outsider attacking an Insider; it is thefirst important appearance in Shaw of a device which was to become the dramaticcentre of all his later plays: the clash of wills. He puts two people of strongcharacter on to the stage, and the audience watches with fascination for theexplosion. He had tried out this device for the first time with Vivie Warren andher mother. It appears again in the court scene between Dick Dudgeon and GeneralBurgoyne in The Devil’s Disciple; it gives piquancy to the relation betweenCaesar and Rufio in Caesar and Cleopatra; it provides the comedy in Man andSuperman, and the tragedy in Saint Joan. A theme which runs through all Shaw’swork is this theme of the will to power, the refusal to be browbeaten, moralcourage. In Major Barbara, the interest is provided by the conflict between thestrong-minded Lady Britomart and her equally strong-minded daughter Barbara;between the armament king Undershaft and Cusins, the Professor of Greek. In TheApple Cart, the self-made politician Boanerges is the first important characteron stage, threatening to bully the king, and immediately the audience waits forthe clash of wills. It is never an obvious, brutal crash: usually it involvesthe skilled fencing of intelligent antagonists. And just as Rufio, thebodyguard, has treated Caesar with rough familiarity, so Mrs. Basham treatsIsaac Newton, and George Fox treats the king, in In Good King Charles’s GoldenDays, written forty years later. Throughout his work, Shaw plays with the ideaof the defiance of authority, and rebellion, in one form or another, is thetheme of all his major plays. Now the Outsider is not necessarily the rebel, butthe rebel is undoubtedly a most important type of Outsider. The rebel attemptsto assert that existence comes before essence, that will comes before authority.In another form, this existentialist theme is presented in Bergson in theopposition between ‘open and closed religion.’ Open religion is the inspiredreligious insight of the prophet and saint; closed religion is the ritual andlaw of a Church. On any level, this opposition between the living force and theforms which it puts on like garments, implies existentialism. And all forms ofthis opposition are present in Shaw’s work (Saint Joan, for instance, is about‘open and closed religion’). It is not too much to say that all Shaw’s centralthemes are existentialist.However, I have left my attempt to trace the Outsider theme in Shaw’sdevelopment. After Candida, its next major expression is in Caesar andCleopatra.Shaw’s Caesar is an Outsider for the very reasons which made Shaw declare thatHamlet was an Outsider; because he has evolved a stage beyond his fellow men,and is quite alone among them, alone and incomprehensible. His opening speechexpresses his isolation. He speaks to the Sphinx, alone in the desert:> Hail, Sphinx; salutation from Julius Caesar! I have wandered in many lands,> seeking the lost regions from which my birth into this world exiled me, and> the company of creatures such as I myself. I have found flocks and pastures,> men and cities, but no other Caesar, no air native to me, no man kindred to> me, none who can do my day’s deed, and think my night’s thought ... Sphinx,> you and I, strangers to the race of men, are no strangers to one another.17It may be that Shaw had Marcus Aurelius in mind in creating Caesar:> POTHINUS: Natural! Then you do not resent treachery?> > CAESAR: Resent! O thou foolish Egyptian, what have I to do with resentment? Do> I resent the wind when it chills me, or the night when it makes me stumble in> the darkness? Shall I resent youth when it turns from age, and ambition when> it turns from servitude? To tell me such a story as this is but to tell me> that the sun will rise tomorrow.18But later, when Cleopatra has had Pothinus murdered for revenge, and defendsherself against Caesar’s condemnation, the tone ceases to be merely stoical:> CLEOPATRA: Listen to me, Caesar. If one man in all Alexandria can be found to> say that I did wrong, I swear to have myself crucified on the door of the> palace by my own slaves.> > CAESAR: If one man in all the world can be found, now or forever, to know that> you did wrong, that man will have either to conquer the world as I have, or be> crucified by it.19Shaw is expressing the essence of Christianity; but Caesar’s preference—andShaw’s—was all for conquering the world by moral greatness, not dying for it.And yet Shaw did not imply a condemnation of the Christian morality ofself-sacrifice. In Methuselah, the two human creatures whom Pygmalion createseach beg that the other be killed, until the Ancient lays her hand on them andraises them to a higher level of life, when they each ask to be killed, but begthat the other be spared.In his Preface to Caesar and Cleopatra, Shaw directed his famous criticismagainst Shakespeare—that he understood human weakness without understandinghuman strength. (It should be observed, at the same time, that Shaw never deniedShakespeare’s greatness as a poet and playwright.) This criticism contains theessence of Shaw, and it also contains the essence of the Outsider’s position.For the Insider, moral and intellectual ideas are unimportant in comparison withaesthetic satisfaction. But for the Outsider, nothing matters but moral heroism.The Insider does not mind people being trivial and unheroic because life isstill good. The Outsider cannot begin living until he has solved the question ofhow to live; like Ivan Karamazov, he rejects the world, he rejects life if itmust be lived trivially. He craves greater intensity of life. In the twentiethcentury, the Insider’s position is the philosophy of our civilisation—the‘go-getter’ utilitarianism. That is why, for any Outsider, all that matters isthat men should become bigger; that is why the Outsider is the heroic figure ofour time, and Outsider tragedies—those of Nietzsche, Lawrence, Van Gogh,Nijinsky—are the great tragedies of our time. That is why the great bulk ofmodern literature must be detestable to the Outsider: for, like Shakespeare, itcares only about human weakness; it looks at human beings through a microscope,not a telescope.After Caesar, Shaw felt that it was time to make a more general statement of hisphilosophy. He does this in his most brilliant play—and perhaps his greatest—Manand Superman.Superficially, this play is on the theme that it is the woman, not the man, whodoes the wooing. This theme need not be taken too seriously. After all, Shaw setout to write a play about Don Juan, and the essence of Shaw’s interpretation ofthe Don Juan legend was that the Don was chased. (Observe that Shaw had writtenabout this theme in An Unsocial Socialist before he had his first affair.) Nodoubt Shaw was right in a sense: in the sense that it is the woman’s job tocontinue the race, and the man’s job to build civilisation; even the most ardentfeminist would not deny that her childbearing function acts as a brake on herintellectual and moral pursuits. But the truth is that the higher form of lifewill always be chased by the lower. The woman with elements of greatness willalways be chased by men; the man with elements of greatness will always bechased by women. And the man or woman who becomes great in a public as well as aprivate sense will always be chased by people of both sexes who hope that bycontact with him they can escape from their own insufficiency.Man and Superman is about a socialist intellectual, John Tanner, who is made theguardian of Ann Whitfield, a girl who is in love with him. In one of theearliest speeches in the play, Tanner summarises a trend which has become thetheme of hundreds of twentieth-century novels and plays: the theme of socialinferiority and shame:> ... even I cannot wholly conquer shame. We live in an atmosphere of shame. We> are ashamed of everything that is real about us; ashamed of ourselves, of our> relatives, of our incomes, of our accents, of our opinions, of our experience,> just as we are ashamed of our naked skins. Good Lord, my dear Ramsden, we are> ashamed to walk, ashamed to ride in an omnibus, ashamed to hire a hansom> instead of keeping a carriage, ashamed of keeping one horse instead of two and> a groom-gardener instead of a coachman and footman. The more things a man is> ashamed of, the more respectable he is ... 20When Tanner finds out that Ann is in love with him (and it takes him two wholeacts to do it), he hastily leaves the country and flies to Spain—only to becaptured by the ‘love-sick brigand’ Mendoza, and held for ransom. That night,asleep in Mendoza’s camp, he has the dream which constitutes the heart of theplay. Tanner dreams that he is his ancestor, Don Juan, and in hell. But hell isnot a place of fire and torment: it is an Outsider’s hell of triviality andendless pettiness. Hell is the home of Insiders. Shaw does not divide the raceinto the good and the wicked: he divides it into Outsiders and Insiders, and theOutsiders go to heaven, the Insiders to hell. Hell is a place of eternalpleasure, eternal frivolity, eternal silliness—everything to revolt an Outsiderwith a lust for seriousness of purpose. Don Juan has been sent there by mistake.Soon Dona Ana arrives to disturb the Don in the solitude in which he has takenrefuge, and shortly after that, the Devil (Mendoza in disguise) and the Statuefrom Mozart, who is Ana’s father. Now begins the long discussion which I havealways felt to be the greatest scene in Shaw, and one of the pinnacles ofEnglish literature. Dona Ana (Ann) has to have it explained to her why hell isnot a place of eternal torment. Her father (the Statue) has come from heaven tolive in hell; he is tired of the dullness of heaven. The Devil explains thedullness of heaven by analogy: in England (the country where he has the greatestfollowing—no doubt America would compete nowadays) there are halls whereclassical concerts are held, and there are racecourses. Nothing prevents thelovers of racing from going to the classical concerts, and the concerts areacknowledged to be a higher, more spiritual form of entertainment thanhorseracing. Nevertheless, the lovers of racing do not flock to the concerthalls. Neither do the inhabitants of hell flock to heaven. Then a long argumentdevelops, in which the Outsider Don Juan tries to explain why he is a ‘socialfailure’ in hell. The Life Force in him makes him uncomfortable when he isforced to sit around doing nothing but amuse himself. Life, he explains, strivestowards the complete conquest of matter by the spirit. Matter and spirit areenemies. Man has a certain mastery over his body—he can make it stand up or sitdown or turn somersaults—but he cannot prevent it from catching diseases ordying. And he cannot guard against accidents, or against being killed by a lowerform of life: an Archimedes can be killed by a stupid Roman soldier. Man’s waytowards the conquest of matter is through spiritual discipline, striving tobecome a higher form of life. It is a development of consciousness. The Aim oflife is to understand itself. Don Juan speaks then of his disappointments inlove, and of how his romanticism was destroyed by his fastidiousness. Heanticipates D. H. Lawrence’s sexual mysticism when he tells how his consciouscriticism of a woman would destroy his desire for her until ‘Life seized me andthrew me into her arms as a sailor throws a scrap of fish into the mouth of aseabird.’21 And when the Devil objects that here, in hell, he has everything heever wanted—music, painting, sexual adventures, and so forth, Juan states hisOutsider’s credo:‘I tell you that as long as I can conceive something better than myself I cannotbe easy unless I am striving to bring it into existence or clearing the way forit. That is the law of my life. That is the working within me of Life’sincessant aspiration to higher organisation, wider, deeper, intenserself-consciousness, and clearer self-understanding. It was the supremacy of thispurpose that reduced love for me to the mere pleasure of a moment ... ’22Shaw, in other words, was ‘heartless’ and uninterested in human weaknesses forthe same reason that all Outsiders are: through a passionate desire to create,to strive for greatness. It is a heartlessness of which the Outsider canpassionately approve.The ‘higher form of life’ that Don Juan strives to create is the NietzscheanSuperman. Shaw felt obscurely that man is on the threshold of a higher form oflife; either that, or the Life Force may scrap him and try something new. He wasright, but not wholly: man is always on the brink of a higher form of life whena civilisation reaches its stage of decline. The decline is a challenge to raisethe standard of conscious life; otherwise it must smash. Man evolved from theape by developing a religious consciousness. He then evolved from the meresuperstitious tribesman by developing his reasoning power. Before he can developto a still higher stage, he must restore the religious consciousness: nothingelse will hold society together. And while religion means ‘closed religion,’mere ritual and superstition, then reason makes its existence impossible.Religion must become what the Outsider understands by it: a body of truth aboutman’s purpose and relation to God. For a whole civilisation to think in Outsiderterms would probably mean the total disappearance of Insiders. And the price offailing to meet the challenge need not be the scrapping of the human race; itmay mean only the scrapping of all that we understand by civilisation. Thealternative is a universal effort to create ‘open religion,’ and perhaps,eventually, a new ‘closed religion.’Don Juan launches a tirade against Insiders which is more devastating thananything in Swift:> In this Palace of Lies a truth or two will not hurt you. Your friends are all> the dullest dogs I know. They are not beautiful: they are only decorated. They> are not clean: they are only shaved and starched. They are not dignified: they> are only fashionably dressed. They are not educated: they are only college> passmen. They are not religious: they are only pewrenters. They are not moral:> they are only conventional. They are not virtuous: they are only cowardly.> They are not even vicious: they are only ‘frail.’ They are not artistic: they> are only lascivious. They are not prosperous: they are only rich. They are not> loyal, they are only servile; not dutiful, only sheepish; not public spirited,> only patriotic; not courageous, only quarrelsome; not determined, only> obstinate; not masterful, only domineering; not self-controlled, only obtuse;> not self-respecting, only vain; not kind, only sentimental; not social, only> gregarious; not considerate, only polite; not intelligent, only opinionated;> not progressive, only factious; not imaginative, only superstitious; not just,> only vindictive; not generous, only propitiatory; not disciplined, only cowed;> and not truthful at all: liars every one of them, to the very backbone of> their souls.23And he gets up and goes off to heaven. At this point, Tanner awakes, to find thepolice swooping on the brigands, and Ann Whitfield looking for him. A socialistthrough and through, he explains to the police that the brigands are his escort.In the last act, Ann finally persuades him to marry her after a dialogue whichhas overtones of Don Giovanni’s last wrangle with the Statue:> TANNER: I will not marry you. I will not marry you.> > ANN: Oh, you will, you will.> > TANNER: I tell you, no, no, no.> > ANN: I tell you, yes, yes, yes.> > TANNER: No.> > ANN: Yes. Before it is too late for repentance. Yes.24Which recalls:> THE COMMANDANT: Pentiti!> > DON GIOVANNI: No.> > THE COMMANDANT: Pentiti!> > DON GIOVANNI: No!> > THE COMMANDANT: Si!> > DON GIOVANNI: No!> > THE COMMANDANT: Si!> > DON GIOVANNI: No!> > THE COMMANDANT: Si, si!> > DON GIOVANNI: No, no!> > THE COMMANDANT: Ah! tempo più non v’è! 25And Tanner marries Ann, who is a very ordinary Insider for whom he is just atalker.So the ghost of Don Giovanni disappears from Shaw’s work. From then on, theOutsider theme becomes even more clearly defined. The next play, John Bull’sOther Island, centres around the Jansenist priest Keegan, and the triumph of thetypical stupid Insider, Broadbent. Shaw is not terribly hostile to Broadbent,who is a well-meaning fool—but a materialistic fool, unable to realise thatfundamentally the artist and poet are opposed to all that materialism standsfor. In Heartbreak House, Shaw takes an altogether sterner stand.Shaw’s next play, Major Barbara, also throws new light on the Outsider theme.The important characters in this play are Cusins, the young Professor of Greek,and Andrew Undershaft, his prospective father-in-law. Undershaft’s daughter,Barbara, is a major in the Salvation Army. Undershaft is an armament king, whosefaith can be summarised in two words: Money and gunpowder. Yet Undershaft hasmuch of Shaw’s Caesar about him; he has the gentleness of a man of immensestrength. He and Cusins soon come into conflict on the question of religion. Intheir first discussion, Cusins quotes Euripides to the effect that most mensquabble and seethe, but the only happy man is the man who knows that merely tobe alive is to be happy (the position of Kirilov in Dostoevsky’s Devils, it willbe remembered, and of William Blake). Undershaft counters by saying that to knowthat living is happiness requires money enough for a decent life, and powerenough to be your own master. (Later, in Heartbreak House, Shaw makes Elliestate the same position:> ELLIE: A soul is a very expensive thing to keep: much more so than a motor> car.> > SHOTOVER: Is it? How much does your soul eat?> > ELLIE: Oh, a lot. It eats music and pictures and books and mountains and lakes> and beautiful things to wear and nice people to be with. In this country you> cant have them without lots of money: that is why our souls are so horribly> starved.26)It is, in fact, the need for leisure of which I spoke at the beginning of thisbook. It is Undershaft’s reason for preaching a gospel of power. If the Outsiderhates modern civilisation for its brutal materialism, his answer is not toretreat from it and go into an ivory tower, but to seek for power over it.Steppenwolf declared that Western civilisation fosters the very delusion ofpersonality from which Eastern civilisation has tried so hard to escape, and hisunspoken conclusion is that the Outsider should turn away from our hurly-burlyof a civilisation to solitude and contemplation. Shaw implies, like Toynbee,that the Outsider must create the power to revitalise his civilisation.Undershaft has, in fact, anticipated Sartre’s doctrine of ‘commitment’—it is theessence of all he has to say. Not retreat from the world, but engagement,commitment. If ultimately the aim of spirit is to gain power over matter, thenit must face the responsibility of action, and not spend its time complainingthat the world is out of joint. Undershaft’s positivism is the positivism of theBhagavad-Gita. It will be remembered that in the Gita, Arjuna, the hero prince,faces his foes in a chariot, and suddenly decides that fighting is futile—infact, reaches the stage of the Hamlet Outsider. Krishna, his charioteer, tellshim not to make a fuss about nothing, for life and death are just a part of agreat cycle of the soul; death is not to be considered as a final plunge intoblackness, but as a minor inconvenience to be suffered before rebirth intoanother body. ‘There never is a time in which I did not exist; nor is there anyfuture in which we shall cease to be.’ 27 And his exhortation reaches its climaxin the words: ‘Go out and fight ... These men are already slain by me,’ implyingthat the actions of gods and heroes are predetermined by a universal law. It isto be observed that Undershaft’s positivism is not just the philosophy of ablunt businessman. When Barbara introduces her father to Peter Shirley, thedown-and-out Bradlaughite, she says: ‘This is my father: I told you he was aSecularist, didnt I?’ and Undershaft, shocked, replies: ‘Not the least in theworld: on the contrary, a confirmed mystic.’ Undershaft, has, in fact, advancedto the position of the Gita—perhaps without knowing it.Undershaft presents the Salvation Army with a cheque for £5000, and Barbaraleaves the Army in disgust at having to accept the profits of war and murder.But later in the play, she has to face an even greater problem when Cusins, theman she is about to marry, decides to accept Undershaft’s offer to go into thearmament business as his successor. Then the great argument begins—betweenUndershaft and Cusins, on the ethics of making weapons of war. Cusins feels thathe can salve his conscience by selling guns to any good cause, but Undershaftwill have none of this; being an armourer, he says, involves selling to anybodywho will pay cash. His morality is a morality of power—but only because hebelieves that all power is spiritual power. If men are to give spiritual powerto the human race, they must begin by having some sort of political power. Butnot the power of governments or dictators; the power of money and prosperity.Undershaft declares that he is the hidden arbiter behind governments: ‘You willmake war when it suits us, and keep peace when it doesnt. You will find out thattrade requires certain measures when we have decided on those measures.’ 28 Hisis very clearly the Nietzschean Master-and-slave morality, but only because herealises that before the slaves can become Masters, they must first accept theleadership of the Masters, as a pupil can only become a teacher by going toschool. Undershaft has faced the Outsider’s second problem. The Outsider’s firstproblem is: How can I acquire spiritual power for myself? and for that purpose,he retreats into solitude. His second problem is: How can I acquire spiritualpower for a whole civilisation? He may try to solve this problem as George Foxor John Wesley or Savonarola tried to solve it. But in a civilisation as complexas ours, a materialist civilisation, the preacher’s effect is inevitablylimited, and has to compete with the cinema and television and cheap literature.The only way left is Undershaft’s way: to strive to become a moving force behindsociety; to acquire power for one’s fellow men by becoming a power among them.But Shaw does not make it clear how Undershaft and Cusins will work to createspiritual power. Cusins summarises his reasons for accepting Undershaft’s offer:> CUSINS: You cannot have power for good without having power for evil too. Even> mother’s milk nourishes murderers as well as heroes ...> > BARBARA: Is there no higher power than that? (Pointing to a shell.)> > CUSINS: Yes, but that power can destroy the higher powers just as a tiger can> destroy a man: Man must master that power first. I admitted this when the> Turks and Greeks were last at war. My best pupil went out to fight for Hellas.> My parting gift to him was not a copy of Plato’s Republic, but a revolver and> a hundred Undershaft cartridges ... That act committed me to this place for> ever. Your father’s challenge has beaten me. Dare I make war on war? I dare. I> must. I will ... 29In other words, if the corruption of our society is to be fought, the Outsidermust fight it from inside, not outside.This is not to be taken as Shaw’s last word on the subject. All that he hasexpressed, through Undershaft, is the doctrine that the Outsider must leave hisivory tower when the time comes. The time is not ripe until he has achievedspiritual power over himself. And an Outsider might well feel, with Gurdjieff,that his degree of power over himself is always so tiny that he should stay insolitude all his life.After Major Barbara, Shaw produced a whole series of light plays: The Doctor’sDilemma, Getting Married, Misalliance, Androcles and the Lion, Pygmalion. In theten years after 1905, when Major Barbara was written, Shaw’s disciples hadreason to suppose that the Master was growing frivolous in his old age.Androcles has a magnificent preface examining Christianity (to which I amindebted for many of the ideas expressed in the introduction to Part Two of thepresent book). But the play itself is a salt-and-sugar mixture of farce andseriousness which produces an impression of cheapness. The important second acthas the Heidegger-like theme of the ‘glimpse of reality’ experienced whilefacing death:> LAVINIA: ... my faith has been oozing away minute by minute whilst Ive been> sitting here, with death coming nearer and nearer, with reality becoming> realler and realler, with stories and dreams fading away into nothing.> > THE CAPTAIN: Are you then going to die for nothing? ...> > LAVINIA: I dont know. If it were anything small enough to know, it would be> too small to die for. I think I’m going to die for God. Nothing else is real> enough to die for.> > THE CAPTAIN: What is God?> > LAVINIA: When we know that, Captain, we shall be gods ourselves.30After this, the dancing lion is an altogether irritating piece of buffoonery.Heartbreak House, the next major work, is an unsuccessful attempt to write aChekhovian play. Chekhov’s method depends on understatement, suggesting thetensions and tragedies beneath a surface of futility and inaction. But Shaw isnot an emotional writer, and he does not succeed in conveying the hidden tormentof his characters. In spite of this failure of conscious intention, HeartbreakHouse still succeeds in being one of Shaw’s best plays. Written two years beforeThe Decline of the West was published, it nevertheless captures the atmosphereof that book. The play is about a houseparty at ‘Heartbreak House’; the guestsare a cross section of English society: Mangan, the businessman, Ellie, the girlwho is going to marry him for his money, her father, a helpless idealist who hasbeen swindled by Mangan, Lady Utterword, the typical English lady, wife of acolonial governor and a lover of horses, Randall, a useless man-about-town. Butmore important than any of these are the residents of ‘Heartbreak House’: HectorHushabye, the romantically handsome liar, his wife Hesione, and CaptainShotover. Shaw rightly considered Shotover one of the greatest characters he hadever created. Shotover is a strange old man, a retired sea captain, who is theonly person in this houseparty of Insiders who has any sense of reality. Hespends his days trying to achieve ‘the seventh degree of concentration.’This is an idea of primary importance for the Outsider, and Shotover’s statementof it is perhaps the clearest single statement of the Outsider’s ultimate aimwhich we have yet encountered. After all, consider almost any Outsider who hasbeen mentioned in this volume or its predecessor: their problem is always thefact that the world is ‘too much with them.’ What all Outsiders have in commonis a desire to escape the endless confusion of the outer world and retreat deepinto themselves. Truth is subjectivity, and is therefore to be achieved bybecoming concentrated in oneself. Ordinarily, when a man concentrates on aproblem, he only retreats into the conscious area of his brain, the reasoningarea. But there are deeper areas—the areas where all the past is stored up, theareas from which those sudden bursts of complete ecstasy flood up intoconsciousness. By lowering himself down into himself, as into a deep mine-shaft,man discovers the source of the secret life, the wellspring of life ecstasywhich drives him on in spite of the difficulties of the exterior world. All lifeis a struggle to reach this inner power, and to assimilate the endlesscomplexities of the outer world, which sap the energies and destroy the appetitefor life. The misery of the Barbusse type of Outsider is due to his having beentrapped in that surface world of consciousness, and separated from the innerlove of life. All the work of D. H. Lawrence is about the sudden contact withthat flood of inner ecstasy achieved in sexual union. When Ramakrishna seized asword to kill himself, his spirit concentrated into a tight ball inside him andsuddenly made him recognise that he contained a powerhouse of life energy: apowerhouse which he could only describe by speaking of ‘a great sea of life’;this was his first ‘vision’ of godhead. Van Gogh was in contact with this innerpowerhouse many times, and so was Nietzsche. Rimbaud achieved innerconcentration by dramatising himself as the arch-Outsider and anti-social being,and thus freeing his consciousness from the feeling that he owed the outer worldhis attention. All genius springs from this ability to concentrate.Even so, no man has ever achieved complete concentration. A poet’s moments ofecstasy are nothing compared to the powerhouse of vitality which he containswithin himself. Most poets achieve the first degree of concentration. A saintlike Ramakrishna might achieve the second degree. Shotover spoke of sevendegrees, and strove to achieve them all.He doesn’t, of course. He is too old. Yet the mere fact that he has had the ideamakes him great, and his greatness is the greatness of Heartbreak House. Hisson-in-law, Hector, is an altogether lower-stage Outsider. Hector is a completeromantic who lives in a dream world of heroic actions. One of the most amusingpassages in the first act is when Hector, alone, begins to strike attitudes,kiss imaginary women, duel with imaginary opponents; suddenly, Shotover walksin, and Hector has to account for his tense attitude by pretending that he isdoing exercises. There then ensues a dialogue which is of great importance toShaw’s Outsider-position. Shotover is carrying dynamite, and he says it is tokill fellows like Mangan.He will make a dynamite that Mangan and his like cannot explode—when he achievesthe seventh degree of concentration.> SHOTOVER: We must win powers of life and death over them ... I refuse to die> until I have invented the means.> > HECTOR: Who are we, that we should judge them?> > SHOTOVER: What are they that they should judge us? Yet they do,> unhesitatingly. There is enmity between our seed. They know it, and act on it,> strangling our souls. They believe in themselves. When we believe in> ourselves, we shall kill them ...> > HECTOR: ... I tell you I have often thought of this killing of human vermin.> Many men have thought of it. Decent men are like Daniel in the lion’s den:> their survival is a miracle; and they do not always survive ... Give me the> power to kill them, and I’ll spare them in sheer ...> > SHOTOVER (cutting in sharply): Fellow feeling?> > HECTOR: No. I should kill myself if I believed that. I must believe that my> spark, small as it is, is divine, and that the red light over their door is> hell fire. I should spare them in simple magnanimous pity.> > SHOTOVER: You cant spare them until you have the power to kill them. At> present they have the power to kill you ...> > HECTOR: They are too stupid to use their power.> > SHOTOVER: Do not deceive yourself: they do use it. We kill the better half of> ourselves every day to propitiate them. The knowledge that these people are> there to render all our aspirations barren prevents us having the aspirations> ... 31It is true that at the end of the play, it is Mangan who is blown up by thebornb, trying to save his own skin, and the others, who flood the house withlights so the raiders will see them, who are spared. But the moral is not thatwe should simply leave it to providence. Once again, Shaw is advisingengagement: the Outsiders must achieve political power over the hogs. In Man andSuperman, Don Juan had pointed out that although the Life Force is stupid, theforces of death and degeneration are even stupider. This can be immediatelyapplied to the Outsiders, and the Insiders who are the leaders of society.Ellie is also an Outsider in the sense of not knowing what she wants out of lifeexcept ‘freedom.’ Shotover tells her:> You are looking for a rich husband. At your age I looked for hardship, danger,> horror, and death, that I might feel the life in me more intensely. I did not> let the fear of death govern my life; and my reward was, I had my life. You> are going to let the fear of poverty govern your life; and your reward will be> that you will eat, but you will not live.32It is again the Outsider’s credo: Salvation lies in extremes. But he cannot makeany suggestions about Ellie’s alternative to marrying Mangan; her statement thather soul needs to eat just like her body is unanswerable. Yet Shotover iscertain of one thing: there must be more consciousness, more purpose anddirection; not merely in the individual, but in our whole civilisation, if it isnot to smash. Mazzini Dunn, Ellie’s idealist father, comments that in politicsone can drift as much as one likes: nothing happens.> SHOTOVER: At sea nothing happens to the sea. Nothing happens to the sky ...> Nothing happens, except something not worth mentioning.> > ELLIE: What is that, O Captain, my captain?> > SHOTOVER (savagely): Nothing but the smash of the drunken skipper’s ship on> the rocks, the splintering of her rotten timbers, the tearing of her rusty> plates, the drowning of the crew like rats in a trap.> > ELLIE: Moral: dont take rum.> > SHOTOVER: That is a lie, child. Let a man drink ten barrels of rum a day, he> is not a drunken skipper until he is a drifting skipper. Whilst he can lay his> course and stand on his bridge and steer it, he is no drunkard. It is a man> who lies drinking in his bunk and trusts to Providence that I call the drunken> skipper, though he drank nothing but the waters of the River Jordan.33Again, Shaw’s meaning is plain: the Outsider must find a direction and commithimself to it, not lie moping about the meaninglessness of the world.After Heartbreak House, Shaw prepared himself for the great effort: the attemptto treat the Outsider’s problems in their widest context. He tried to do this inBack to Methuselah. Unfortunately, he still had the terrible habit of mixingfarce and seriousness, and the play is too painful a mixture of these to be hismasterpiece. Nevertheless, as always with Shaw, the ideas are alive, no matterhow uncertain the artistic achievement may be. It does not provide a completesolution; there are many things that can be added to it in the light of Toynbeeand Whitehead. Nevertheless, it is, taken as a whole, Shaw’s most importantachievement.His long Preface has a very simple theme, one which has already been treatedmany times in the course of this book: the rise of materialism, and the need fora new religion. The Preface—one of Shaw’s most lucid and witty pieces ofwriting—speaks of the unbelief of the Victorian era, and the rise of Darwinismand Marxism. Shaw points out that Darwin tried to reduce life to a merebiological mechanism, but that Lamarck had advanced a far more sensible theoryof evolution long before Darwin. Lamarck suggested that species evolve becausethey want to evolve; Darwin thought they evolved automatically, because theirconditions altered. Finally, Shaw makes the crucial statement: ‘ ... I hadalways known that civilisation needs a religion as a matter of life or death.’He asks the question: ‘What religion?’ and admits that he himself finds areligious attitude easy enough to accept. This is the religious attitude which Ioutlined in The Outsider. Shaw calls it ‘Vitalism.’ But how is this religion tobe made universal? Is it to be taught in schools? Are children to be told aboutLamarck and Darwin instead of about Jesus? No: for the legends and stories ofsaints are essential to religion, and so is a Church. But, Shaw asks, why notpool all the religious legends of the world, and teach schoolchildren not onlyabout Jesus but about Gautama and Zarathustra and Krishna too? In science, hepoints out, you can take the truth and leave the myth: you do not have tobelieve that Newton lay down in an orchard before you can believe the theory ofgravitation. But most Churches nowadays are insisting upon the mythical elementsas being vital to the truth of their religion: the Vicarious Atonement, theAssumption of the Virgin, and all the rest. The consequence is that the educatedman becomes a sceptic, and declares that his religion is humanity.Since Shaw propounded this idea, many thinkers have taken it up: notably AldousHuxley and Arnold Toynbee. Huxley has also argued that there is a kernel oftruth common to all religions, out of which a new world religion can bemanufactured. Toynbee has recently expounded the same view in his Historian’sApproach to Religion.Now no good Catholic or Hindu could be blamed for rejecting this idea asinadequate. It is difficult to think of such an ersatz religion as anythingother than a sort of thin soup. No one who examines the problem closely can failto agree that there is nothing to be gained by trying to manufacture a newreligion—especially in our intellectual workshops. Yet the alternatives are tooawful to contemplate. Any honest person who considers the problem is bound tofeel the need to take up some ‘attitude’: to commit himself. And this is justwhat the very nature of the problem makes it almost impossible to do.In Methuselah, Shaw tries strenuously to define our dilemma. Like Whitehead inScience and the Modern World, he opens with an attack on scientific materialism.‘ ... People were unable to understand ... why I habitually deridedNeo-Darwinism as a ghastly idiocy, and would fall on its professorsslaughterously in public discussions.’34 He then goes on to speak of theappalling results of Darwinian materialism in politics—he is referring to the1914 war—and points out, like Toynbee, that civilisations invariably collapse atthe point where man’s power outruns his religion. ‘What hope is there, then, ofhuman improvement? According to the Neo-Darwinists, to the Mechanists, no hopewhatever, because improvement can only come through some senseless accident ...But this dismal creed does not discourage those who believe that the impulsethat produces evolution is creative. They have observed the simple fact that thewill to do anything can and does, at a certain pitch of intensity set up byconviction of its necessity, create and organise new tissue to do it with. Tothem therefore mankind is by no means played out yet.’35Now Shaw introduces the most important idea of the play: ‘Among other mattersapparently changeable at will is the duration of human life. Weismann, a veryclever and suggestive biologist who was unhappily reduced to idiocy byNeo-Darwinism, pointed out that death is not an eternal condition of life, butan expedient introduced to provide for continual renewal without overcrowding.’This suggestion is developed in the play itself. Shaw’s diagnosis can besummarised: Human beings are fools because they have no time to be wise. Theyare thrown down into the world, not knowing who they are or what they aresupposed to do. Some of them instinctively feel that life should have a purposeand meaning, and manage to imbue their own lives with a certain direction. Thesewe call men of genius. But the majority take the world much as they find it, andare contented if they can keep alive and well fed, and live and die as theirparents lived and died. These are the Insiders. They are necessary to keep therace moving—to provide the solid bedrock of stability and ordinariness that lifebuilds on. (Thomas Mann had such an admiration for them that they are the heroesof many of his books.) Even the men of genius—or the Outsiders, who are men ofgenius in embryo—never have enough time to really settle down in the world witha serene sense of purpose, and to set out to create more consciousness for thehuman race in full knowledge of what they are doing. For the strength of theOutsider and the man of genius lies in his inner life, and the world is acomplicated place which demands a great deal of attention. Often, by the time anOutsider has fought his battles, and developed courage and certainty, and hasstarted to feel ‘at home in the world,’ it is time for him to leave it. Thereare two obvious remedies, not mutually exclusive: to become mature much younger,or to live much longer. And maturity does not mean mere technicalaccomplishment. It means the real maturity—the maturity of which Goethe talkedin Wilhelm Meister—the ability to grasp the meaning and purpose of humanexistence. In Methuselah, Shaw envisages the human race achieving both theseends.But even if the Outsiders succeeded in solving their Outsider problems and thenextending their term of life to apply their new sense of purpose—what about theInsiders? In his play, Shaw solves the problem by making the Insiders graduallydie out as superfluous. But the real problem would be for the Outsiders, asusual, to find some way to persuade the Insiders to understand the problems andtheir solution. An Outsider-Prophet invented Christianity, but the Church foundits own means of making Christianity acceptable to the masses. And in hisPreface, Shaw recognises that it would be no solution if the Outsiders all wentoff on to an island (as they do in the play) and left the Insiders to their owndevices. The difference between the Insider and Outsider is the differencebetween a man capable of thinking of nothing but personal appetites andambitions, and the man driven by something greater than his own personality. Theproblem of the Outsiders has always been to persuade the Insiders to obey thesame laws as Outsiders, and for this purpose they have constructed religionswith their laws and commandments. The aim of the Church has always been topersuade men to behave as if they were something greater than a bundle ofappetites and perceptions. In the twentieth century, science has told man thathe is just that and no more. The effects are not immediate and catastrophic;they simply lead to a slow disintegration of our society. But even if theOutsider recognises that scientific materialism is the real villain (thematerialism symbolised by Boss Mangan in Heartbreak House), the problem of howto uproot it and replace it still remains. Shaw says, with admirable insight:‘As long as the Church of England preaches a single doctrine that the Brahman,the Buddhist, the Mussulman, the Parsee, and all the other sectarians ... cannotaccept, it ... will remain what it is at present ... a danger to the State, andan obstruction to the fellowship of the Holy Ghost!’36 But his solution is toosimple: ‘What we should do, then, is to pool our legends and make a delightfulstock of religious folklore on an honest basis for all mankind. With our mindsfreed from pretence and falsehood we could enter into the heritage of all thefaiths.’37 If some council of Vitalists were convened to discuss the problems ofour society, they might well agree that the ideal would be to create a newChurch, whose intellectual foundations could be left to theOutsider-philosophers, and whose legends could be drawn from every source fromthe Popol-Vuh to the Prometheus Unbound. They would then be left with thequestion of how to bring it home to the ordinary man. In ancient India, thepriests could leave this to the average man’s fear of nature. The Buddhaappealed to an Outsider-sense that the world is a den of misery, and that onlyreligious discipline can save man from it. Christian thinkers relied on the samefeeling (early Christians were, after all, mainly oppressed minorities), butalso produced Jesus as the Saviour, and an after-life of bliss. Mahometanismpromised its followers a sensual paradise after death. In the twentieth century,the scientists have replaced the priests as interpreters of the universe. Therelation between Outsiders and Insiders is no longer simplified by theintellectual superiority of the Outsiders; on the contrary, the modern Outsiderhas no intellectual pretensions in comparison with the Insider scientist andphilosopher. He is only distinguished by his sense of ‘anguish,’ the frustratedlonging for spiritual purpose and certainty. Shaw’s solution in Methuselah is sorudimentary that it ignores most of these difficulties.Yet even so—even if Shaw does not reveal himself as a systematic thinker in thesense that Kant or Hegel are—he brings the insight of a great artist and poet tothe problems which he considers. Certain matters he expresses with brilliant andstaggering finality: for instance, the important religious question ofdiscipline, self-control:> As there is no place in Darwinism for free will, or any other sort of will,> the Neo-Darwinists held that there is no such thing as self-control. Yet> self-control is just the one quality of survival value which Circumstantial> Selection must invariably ... develop in the long run. Uncontrolled qualities> may be selected for survival and development for certain periods and under> certain circumstances. For instance, since it is the ungovernable gluttons who> strive the hardest to get food and drink, their efforts would develop their> strength and cunning in a period of such scarcity that the utmost they could> do would not enable them to over-eat themselves. But a change of circumstances> involving a plentiful supply of food would destroy them. We see this very> thing happening often enough in the case of the healthy and vigorous poor man> who becomes a millionaire by one of the accidents of our competitive commerce,> and immediately proceeds to dig his grave with his teeth. But the> self-controlled man survives all such changes of circumstance, because he> adapts himself to them, and eats neither as much as he can hold nor as little> as he can scrape along on, but as much as is good for him. What is> self-control? It is nothing but a highly developed vital sense, dominating and> regulating the mere appetites. To overlook the very existence of this supreme> sense; to miss the obvious inference that it is the quality that distinguishes> the fittest to survive ... ; all this, which the Neo-Darwinians did in the> name of Natural Selection, shewed the most pitiable want of mastery of their> own subject, the dullest lack of observation of the forces upon which Natural> Selection works. [My italics.] 38Here, in a single sentence, Shaw has defined the word ‘religion’ in the sense inwhich the Outsider understands it: a highly developed vital sense, dominatingthe mere appetites. For the poet and visionary, the need for this domination ofthe appetites is so self-evident that it requires no explanation. For the‘average sensual man,’ there is no reason for dominating the appetites beyondthe limits set by ordinary worldly prudence. Knowing nothing of visions, or ofany way of regarding himself other than as a mere unit of the social body, hehas no reason to exercise a will to self-change. True religion means to acceptas a norm for all human beings the deepest insights of the prophets andvisionaries.The story of Back to Methuselah is so well known that I need waste very fewwords summarising it. In the first of its five long acts, Adam and Eve decide toset a limit to their term of life, because living for eternity would beintolerable. Already the problem of original sin is present: they cannot bear tolive with their own personalities for all eternity. The Outsider’s accents beginto echo even in the Garden of Eden: ‘I am tired of myself. And yet I must enduremyself, not for a day ... but for ever.’39 Adam wants to escape from himself,like all the Outsiders of the previous volume, and in order to accomplish this,he decides to die. He has chosen the wrong road—the road of Villiers del’Isle-Adam’s Axel. He does not realise that the way of escape from personalitymust lie forward, not backward. But Eve knows there is another way out of thetime-trap: the way of the artist and visionary. She speaks of some of herchildren who are weaklings and cowards, and yet have a strange power ofcreation. ‘They have not will enough to create instead of dreaming; but theserpent said that every dream could be willed into creation by those strongenough to believe in it.’40 Adam would like to shed his personality every year,as a snake sheds its skin; Eve’s son Enoch has given up his personality to dothe will of the Voice that he hears in the hills. Adam impatiently tells her tostop talking and go on with her work—otherwise she will starve. Eve answers:‘Man need not always live by bread alone. There is something else. We do not yetknow what it is; but some day we shall find out; and then we will live on thatalone ... ’41The second act jumps forward to 1920, when two brothers have decided that mancan live far longer than his average seventy-five years when he understands thatonly by doing this can civilisation be saved. Dramatically, this act is dull andfatiguing to read; it is devoted mainly to satirising two politicians based onLloyd George and Asquith. But the ‘Gospel of the Brothers Barnabas’ is ofsupreme importance. Franklyn Barnabas predicts a new religion of creativeevolution, ‘a religion that has its intellectual roots in science and philosophyjust as mediaeval Christianity had its intellectual roots in Aristotle,’ and thecoming of a new type of man who will live for three hundred years. The thirdact, set two hundred and fifty years later, is a satire on a few Britishgovernment officials who discover—to their horror—that two of their colleagues—aman and a woman—are over two hundred years old. Again, the satire is no longerwitty. In fact, the middle three acts of this play are a justification ofTolstoy’s criticism of Shaw—that he lost effect by trying to be funny. Thefourth act is almost completely superfluous; it establishes nothing except thatthe long-livers have now formed their own community. The satire on the‘short-livers’ has now become downright tiresome; it has not even the occasionalmagnificent lines and speeches that make the previous two acts bearable. It isperhaps the appalling boredom of this fourth act which has blinded critics tothe greatness of the act that follows it: for almost without exception this lastact of the play has been condemned by its critics. This should not prejudice us;for As Far As Thought Can Reach is undoubtedly one of the greatest things thatShaw ever wrote.The time has moved forward thirty thousand years. The world has regained thesimplicity of Ancient Greek civilisation. A group of youths and maidens dance infront of a temple. That morning they will have a birth ceremony: a girl is to beborn out of an egg. When she is born, she will be as fully developed as a girlof twenty. The youths and girls have nothing else to do but amuse themselveswith dancing and games and fine arts—or science, if their bent happens to liethat way. As they dance, an Ancient walks among them in deep meditation—a nakedand hairless old man, many centuries old. They crowd around him and ask whetherhis life of meditation does not bore him. He tells them gravely: ‘One moment ofthe ecstasy of life as we live it would strike you dead.’42 They agree amongthemselves that when they reach four years old—the age at which all desire forphysical pleasure disappears—they will kill themselves. They cannot imagine anyother pleasures than those connected with the body and emotions. A few minuteslater we are shown this process of maturing when a sculptor exhibits his latestwork: everyone is horrified that he has made nothing but busts of Ancients, buthe tells them the legend of Michelangelo, who began by filling the SistineChapel with paintings of beautiful naked men and women, but ended by paintingprophets and sybils, ‘whose majesty was that of the mind alone at itsintensest.’(Inevitably, one is reminded of the lines from Yeats’s ‘Under Ben Bulben’:> Michael Angelo left a proof> > On the Sistine Chapel roof,> > Where but half-awakened Adam> > Can disturb globe-trotting Madam> > Till her bowels are in heat,> > Proof that there’s a purpose set> > Before the secret working mind:> > Profane perfection of mankind.43It is strange that Yeats, who disliked Shaw’s work so much, should have come soclose to echoing the ideas of Back to Methuselah.)Pygmalion, a scientific prodigy, has manufactured a pair of human beings. Heexplains that life, like electricity, is conducted by certain kinds of matter offine organisation. The only difficulty about making life in the laboratory istherefore simply that of making highly organised organic matter. Once the matteris made, it lives automatically. Pygmalion’s prodigies get out of hand andaccidentally kill their creator; but when the Ancient lays his hand on theirheads and tries to raise them to a higher level of life, they die of spiritualexhaustion. Like the human beings of our own age, they lack the will power forself-change.Their deaths lead to the most interesting scene of this act: the attempt of theAncients to explain to the young people what the process of maturing actuallymeans. These remarks are an extension of what Tanner said in Man and Superman:that the artist’s task is to create more consciousness. ‘You use a glass mirrorto see your face: you use works of art to see your soul.’44 The artist attemptsto give himself greater intensity of life by using art as a sort of crutch forhis will power. ‘It leads,’ the Ancient says, ‘to the truth that you can createnothing but yourself.’45 This is the task in which the Ancients are continuallyengaged: self-creation. Their purpose can be expressed in a single sentence:Make perfect your will. The Ancients no longer need works of art or literatureto act as a crutch to the will; they have ‘a direct sense of life,’ and cantransform their physical shapes by an act of will. They never sleep; they ceasedto need sleep at the age of four, when the intellectual world became so excitingthat sleep became a tiresome interruption of the delight of thought. (It will berecalled that the Bhagavad-Gita credits Arjuna with this same power, andfrequently refers to him as ‘the conqueror of sleep.’) But, they explain, theproblem is still that they are slaves of their bodies, and completely reliantupon them. When they have achieved sufficient will power, they hope to be ableto master the body completely to the point of ceasing to be at the mercy ofaccidental death: then they will be immortal. The play ends with the ghosts ofAdam and Eve reviewing the history of mankind, and wondering where it will end.Then Lilith, the primeval mother (Ramakrishna’s Kali), makes her famous speech,with its phrase: ‘ ... their life does not fail them even in the hour of theirdestruction.’46 The Outsider’s problem is, ultimately, the problem of thefailure of life: the problem of the escape from personality. In Methuselah, Shawhas come closer than any other writer to diagnosing this problem and lookingtowards a solution.Strangely enough, this last act of Shaw’s play is the one that has excited mostcondemnation from critics of his thought; and the condemnation is always of thesame nature: horror at his conception of the Ancient. The usual epithets appliedto the Shavian Ancient are ‘dreary,’ ‘repellent,’ ‘heartless,’ ‘abstract.’ Forthe critics who have a grudge against Shaw because of his ‘lack of heart,’ theAncient seems to be the culminating insult; they find him as incomprehensible asa late Beethoven quartet would be to a lover of Ivor Novello. Other criticsattack the concept of the Ancient from the D. H. Lawrence-Walt Whitman point ofview, declaring that it is insane to regard the body as totally unimportant.Here again, I think, there is a misconception; the Ancients are not ‘contemnersof the body,’ any more than Nietzsche’s Zarathustra was. Their complete powerover it is like an athlete’s power over his body: a means to intenser life.Together with the third act of Man and Superman, the last act of Methuselah isShaw’s supreme achievement. It is a contribution to world literature theimportance of which may not be realised fully for many centuries, for it has thepower of vision combined with a deceptive clarity of expression. At the end ofthe Methuselah preface, Shaw expressed the hope that younger hands might soonleave his own work far behind. It may be that younger men will be able to gofurther than Shaw by standing on his shoulders; but it is unlikely thatMethuselah will ever be left behind as a work of the religious imagination.After Methuselah, Shaw produced no more important plays. Saint Joan, his nextplay, is certainly very fine theatre; it is also the play by which he is knownto many readers who otherwise find his cast of mind unsympathetic. This initself is enough to make any lover of Shaw suspicious of it. For me, it is asfar below Shaw’s best work—Major Barbara or Heartbreak House—as Shakespeare’sKing Lear (in my opinion, at any rate) is below Hamlet. The trial scene reachesgreatness as drama; but in retrospect, the whole play seems to have nothing tosay.But for readers who may have been misled by the dreary satire of Methuselah intobelieving that Shaw had lost his talent for comedy, the next play is atriumphant disproof. The Apple Cart remains Shaw’s best comedy, for it hasenough seriousness in it to make it weightier than any of his other comedies.Once again, the play is based on the principle of the clash of wills: this time,King Magnus is pitted against his Prime Minister and cabinet. The play has no‘message’ in the sense that the middle-period comedies have, but at least Shawhad proved that a man can still be writing at his best at the age ofseventy-four, unlike Ibsen, who drained himself dry and completely exhausted hisimagination by writing When We Dead Awaken at seventy-two.In the remaining quarter of a century of his life, Shaw wrote eight morefull-length plays, and eleven playlets. Some of these are simply not worthreading—a category into which, so far, none of Shaw’s work has fallen. Some areinteresting ideas that are carelessly handled. For instance, The Simpleton ofthe Unexpected Isles is about the Last Judgement, and really about the questionof what constitutes the value of a human being in the ‘eyes of God’ or the LifeForce. When the Angel sounds the trump of the Last Judgement, the useless peoplesimply vanish into thin air. ‘The useless people, the mischievous people, theselfish somebodies and the noisy nobodies, are dissolving into space ... Thelives which have no use, no meaning, no purpose, will fade out. We shall have tojustify our existences or perish.’47 Shaw is really letting his Outsider’simpatience with Insiders have full rein; but he does not try to expressprecisely what it is that justifies the existence of human beings. The Outsiderhas a deep sense that all human beings are failures; that if there were really aLast Judgement in which every man had to demonstrate that he had lived his lifewith the fullest possible exercise of his will power and sense of purpose, wewould all dissolve into space.Of these later plays, at least one touches a completely new note. Too True to BeGood is a strange mixture of bad comedy and the intellectual tragedy of thepostwar period. On the surface, it is just an attempt to write about ‘theyounger generation,’ the generation which Evelyn Waugh was then portraying sobrilliantly. On this level, the play is a disappointing farce, which drags onfor two acts, with a caricature of T. E. Lawrence thrown in for good measure.But in the third act, an old man appears—the father of one of the ‘youngpeople’—and makes long speeches in which, for the first time, the world of themodern Outsider begins to appear in Shaw—the world which Sartre and AldousHuxley describe.> Yes, sir; the universe of Isaac Newton ... has crumbled ... before the> criticism of Einstein. Newton’s universe was the stronghold of rational> Determinism ... Everything was calculable: everything happened because it must> ... And now—now—what is left of it? ... All is caprice: the calculable world> has become incalculable ... 48These are the accents of Mind at the End of its Tether:> A frightful queerness has come into life ... Hitherto, events have been held> together by a certain logical consistency, as the heavenly bodies have been> held together by gravitation. Now it is as if that cord had vanished ... 49Shaw’s Elder speaks with the same tones:> ‘Nothing can save us from a perpetual headlong fall into a bottomless abyss> but a solid footing of dogma; and we no sooner agree to that than we find that> the only trustworthy dogma is that there is no dogma. As I stand here I am> falling into that abyss, down, down, down. We are all falling into it ... ’50And at the end of the play, the son of the Elder delivers a long sermon on theloss of faith and belief caused by the war, and on the demoniacal desire of theyounger generation to strip life naked. (Shaw may be thinking of Joyce’s Ulyssesor the many other realistic novels that followed it.) This last act is a curiousmixture of greatness and low comedy. It shows that Shaw had it in him to write agreat play about the entre deux guerres period. Reading this play, it isimpossible not to wish, with Tolstoy, that Shaw had known when to drop his senseof humour. In his later years, Shaw was, in many ways, a disappointed man, forhis effect on his age was far less than he might have hoped. But it was his ownfault; if he had continued to write with the seriousness of the last part ofMethuselah, his influence on his age might have been as great as Dostoevsky’s.His power of rising to heights of prophetic greatness always ran in doubleharness with a sense of humour that sometimes became puerile. (It may be thatthis type of humour is peculiarly Irish: James Joyce is said to have possessedit, but at least he kept it for his private life.)After a decade of these appalling comedies, many of Shaw’s admirers wished hewould stop writing. But with his usual unpredictability, he suddenly producedanother extremely fine play, In Good King Charles’s Golden Days.Once again, the play is based on the great Shavian principle of the clash ofwills. The scene is Sir Isaac Newton’s house; King Charles comes to visit him,then George Fox, Sir Godfrey Kneller (Shaw wanted a painter—Rembrandt would havebeen ideal, but his dates did not fit, and Kneller’s did), and variousmistresses of the king. Without perhaps fully realising it, Shaw was treating asituation that symbolised the whole problem of Western culture; for with GeorgeFox, the religious rebel, and Isaac Newton, the unconscious originator of somuch modern scepticism, he had touched on the problem of the bifurcation ofnature: Fox and Newton represent different aspects of the decline of the Churchand the new epoch of humanism. By throwing in Charles—the Don Juan figure—Shawhad also unconsciously symbolised the whole of his own temperament: the thinker,the prophet, the libertine and lover of life.After Good King Charles, there is only one more full-length play, BuoyantBillions, written when Shaw was ninety-one. By the standards of the plays of the’thirties, it is a good play. It also contains something of Shaw’s last word onthe Outsider question. As the play opens, a father asks his son what he intendsto do with his life. The son replies: ‘Be a world-betterer,’ and explains thatworld-bettering is the profession of the practical idealist—of Ruskin, Plato,Jesus, Gautama, Luther, William Morris. In this choice of examples, weimmediately see the Outsider theme reappearing; Ruskin, the mixture ofmelancholy aesthete and practical socialist, followed by a number of religiousrebels, and finally Morris, the man who managed to lead an enviably balancedlife between romantic Outsiderism and practical creativeness.But Shaw does nothing in particular with his theme. The rest of the play seemsto have no connection whatever with it. The potential rebel meets a girl in themiddle of the jungle, and follows her back to London trying to persuade her tomarry him. She is the daughter of old Bill Buoyant, the millionaire, and thelast act of the play is a long discussion between all the members of Buoyant’sfamily in his house. The only interesting member of this family is Secondborn,the mathematical amateur, who has the tremendous line: ‘I don’t want to behappy. I want to be alive and active.’51 And Secondborn ends the play by talkingin a vein reminiscent of the Shavian Ancient:> And who dares say that mathematics and reasoning are not passions? Mathematic> perception is the noblest of all the faculties! This cant about their being> soulless, dead, inhuman mechanisms is contrary to the plainest facts of life> and history. What has carried our minds further than mathematical foresight?> ... God is not Love: Love is not Enough: the appetite for more truth, more> knowledge, for measurement and precision, is far more universal: even the> dullest fools have some glimmer of it ... Mathematical passion alone has no> reaction: our pleasure in it promises a development in which life will be an> intellectual ecstasy surpassing the ecstasies of saints.52Shaw’s last play, a brief parable called Why She Would Not, deals again with thetheme of Major Barbara: that man must strive for social efficiency; forotherwise, all the Outsider’s spiritual efforts count for nothing. At the end,Shaw was unrelenting: his last hero is completely heartless, but theheartlessness is the ecstasy of a man whose final loyalty is to life itself, theparadoxical destroyer and creator symbolised in the Hindu goddess Kali.Considering Shaw’s output since the First World War, it is not surprising thathe failed to have any great influence on the generations that grew up during thewar. The first decade of this century had an atmosphere of slightlyirresponsible optimism, but the war refined artistic sensibility, which in someways reverted to the nostalgic mood of the ’nineties. Shaw, Chesterton, Wells,Belloc, were all ‘personalities’ stating their convictions. Wilfred Owen, Joyce,Eliot, Pound, Hemingway, all tried to efface their personalities in their art,and to write again as sensitive recording-instruments. 1900 to 1914 was a proseepoch. 1918 to 1930 was an epoch of poetry, where the ideal was ‘negativecapability.’ It was natural that it should be felt that Shaw lacked thisnegative capability. The appalling plays of the ’thirties underlined thatimpression.But it was not true. The negative capability was there—the intense concern withthe Outsider’s problems (which, I have tried to show, was really the centralpreoccupation of the postwar writers). No doubt if Shaw had died after MajorBarbara, he would have been ready for reassessment by the nineteen-twenties, andEliot would have pointed out that John Bull’s Other Island has a profoundlyreligious standpoint. But Shaw went on, dragging a reputation for being a mereprose writer in an age where all literary art was supposed to aspire towardspoetry.What of our own age? ‘Prose’ is reappearing; convictions are again beingaffirmed. But this is not therefore merely a return swing of the pendulum. It israther a time of digestion; a time for considering the first fifty years of ourcentury as a whole. For the first time, Shaw can be seen clearly in his relationto Wells on the one side, and Eliot and Joyce on the other. And it can be seenat once that he belongs to something far greater than a ‘prose’ epoch of thetwentieth century. He stands in relation to Goethe and Nietzsche and Kierkegaardas an existentialist thinker, whose central preoccupations were education(Bildung) and religion.It is difficult to summarise Shaw’s contribution to the Outsider problem: itcovers so many aspects. He began as a romantic Outsider with a strong practicaltrait; that is to say, he began as a confirmed Outsider with a strong convictionthat the Outsider’s problems can be solved. He was lucky in being born with asingularly healthy outlook; he was not subject to moods of deep pessimism. Hisfirst apprenticeship was under Dickens and Fielding, Shakespeare and Mozart; hissecond under Marx and Henry George. If he had been brought up on Wagner andSchiller, Stendhal and Flaubert, his writing would be more acceptable to ourage; at least his affinity with Nietzsche and Kierkegaard would be lessdifficult to grasp. His minor works might have gained, and the novels of histwenties would not have been so bad; but his major work might have lost by it.He was trained in a classical school, and his writing has a classical hardnessof outline. Eliot, Joyce and Pound all revolted against romanticism in the end,and became ‘neo-classicists’ without seeing that Shaw had been a neo-classicistfor fifty years. Shaw was always in revolt. At ninety, when he wrote BuoyantBillions, he was still irritated by the sloppiness of thought which confusedweakness with humanity and sentimentality with intuition, which considered theaim of human life to be happiness, and thought of ‘intellect’ as a barren andinhuman faculty. He was still fighting the battles that had defeated Nietzschesixty years before.In the last analysis, Shaw failed. He towers over the ‘successful’ writers ofhis age; nevertheless, the works of his last twenty-five years represent a slowdecline, much as he had insisted that men should live longer in order to becomegreater. Where did the failure lie? At some point in his life, he ceased todevelop; and the point can be placed roughly after Back to Methuselah.Development—by the existentialist definition—means a steady surmounting ofdifficulties, the slow absorbing of complexities. Up to Methuselah, Shaw haddeveloped his Outsider theme to the point of recognising the need for a newreligion: to seeing that the Outsider problem finally becomes a problem ofhistory and civilisation. After Methuselah, he relaxed on his laurels and wascontent to repeat himself. His next major work was his Intelligent Woman’s Guideto Socialism (1928), a rehashing of all his Fabian pamphlets. In a chapter on‘The Natural Limit to Liberty,’ he begins by saying: ‘Once for all, we are notborn free; and we never can be free. When all the human tyrants are slain ordeposed there will still be the supreme tyrant that can never be slain ordeposed, and that tyrant is nature.’53 Admittedly, he is now talking aboutsocialism, and not about ultimate human aims; so it cannot be objected that heis retreating from his gospel in Back to Methuselah. Yet his friend Wells hadonly recently written his own vast summary, The Outline of History, and there isno good reason why, after the Guide to Socialism, Shaw should not have venturedinto the realms of historical philosophy to investigate the religious questionswhich he raises in Methuselah. Alternatively, he might have turned to the studyof subjective freedom (as distinguished from social freedom) and developedCaptain Shotover’s mysticism. Instead, he relaxed for twenty years, and wrotewith a carelessness that steadily reduced his reputation among serious writers.When Shaw is read in the light of the existentialist thinkers, a newphilosophical position arises from his work as a whole, a position of which hehimself was probably unconscious. It is this: that although the ultimate realitymay be irrational, yet man’s relation to it is not. Existentialism means therecognition that life is a tiny corner of casual order in a universe of chaos.All men are aware of that chaos; but some insulate themselves from it and refuseto face it. These are the Insiders, and they make up the overwhelming majorityof the human race. The Outsider is the man who has faced chaos. If he is anabstract philosopher—like Hegel—he will try to demonstrate that chaos is notreally chaos, but that underlying it is an order of which we are unaware. If heis an existentialist, he acknowledges that chaos is chaos, a denial of life—orrather, of the conditions under which life is possible. If there is nothing butlife and chaos, then life is permanently helpless—as Sartre and Camus think itis. But if a rational relation can somehow exist between them, ultimatepessimism is avoided, as it must be avoided if the Outsider is to live at all.It is this contribution which makes Shaw the key figure of existentialistthought.* I should mention that when I use the word ‘consciousness,’ I intend it toembrace the whole area of living consciousness in any form: i.e. theconsciousness of an amoeba, or the so-called ‘unconscious mind’ of a humanbeing.* I must confess that it was from Shaw’s use of the term in this passage thatthe term Outsider (with a capital O) crept into my own vocabulary at about theage of sixteen."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE—WITTENGENSTEIN AND WHITEHEADLudwig Wittgenstein was born in Vienna in 1889. He came of a remarkable family.His father was an engineer who became an Undershaft figure in the iron and steelindustry of Austria, a man of intelligence and powerful character. His motherhad the temperament of an artist; sensitive, highly musical, a close friend ofBrahms, she made the Wittgenstein home a centre of culture in Vienna. Ludwig wasthe youngest of a family of eight, all of them gifted. He was educated at homeuntil he was fourteen, then went to school at Linz for three years. An interestin science had developed since his childhood, and when he left school, hedecided to study engineering. He had always shown an ability to make things withhis hands (he had constructed a sewing machine when he was a small boy); in hisadolescence, this developed into an interest in aeroplanes. (The Wright brothershad made the first machine-propelled flight in 1903, when Wittgenstein wasfourteen.) When he was nineteen, and had finished his engineering studies inBerlin, he came to England and registered as a research student in engineeringat Manchester University. He remained there for three years and conducted manyexperiments in aeronautics, including some on the jet reaction engine. Soon, hisinterests switched to the mathematical problems involved in the design of thepropeller, and from there to pure mathematics. He patented some of hisinventions in aeroplane design. Yet in spite of his interest in scientificproblems, the years of study were not happy. His friend Von Wright (to whosebiographical article I am indebted in the following pages) mentions thatWittgenstein probably lived on the border of mental illness, and was alwaysafraid of being driven across it. It is possible that his interest in scienceand mathematics may have been a deliberate attempt on his part to counterbalancecertain ‘morbid’ tendencies of his mind. The great clarity of all his majorwritings seems to have a positive fear of obscurity and indefinitenessunderlying it. Schopenhauer’s World as Will and Idea influenced him greatly as avery young man, and encouraged in him the same kind of romantic outlook that ithad encouraged in Nietzsche. And, like Nietzsche, he turned to the clean,precise outlines of scientific knowledge as an antidote. (Nietzsche, of course,studied philology.)But one of the major influences on Wittgenstein’s development was a reading ofBertrand Russell’s Principles of Mathematics. Russell had conceived the ideathat mathematics and logic are ultimately the same thing. This led him to thenotion that philosophy might one day be reduced to a set of mathematicalsymbols. Kierkegaard, of course, had attacked such an idea half a centurybefore; for if truth is subjectivity—that is, intensity of insight—it isobviously impossible to arrive at it by logic alone. However, Wittgenstein knewnothing of Kierkegaard, and he was intoxicated by Russell’s idea. He went toJena to meet another philosopher who had the same notion—Frege—and was advisedby him to go and study under Russell at Cambridge.In 1912, he was admitted to Trinity College. Cambridge was a hive ofintellectual activity. Russell and Alfred North Whitehead had just finishedtheir immense Principia Mathematica, and G. E. Moore was at the height of hispowers. G. H. Hardy, one of the finest mathematicians of the time, was there,and J. M. Keynes, the economist, who, according to Russell, had ‘one of thesharpest intellects I have come across.’ With his Teutonic seriousness and histendency to gloom and introspection, Wittgenstein found Cambridge difficult tounderstand: it was full of an atmosphere of belief in progress and freethinking. There is a story that Wittgenstein was once having coffee with Russelland Moore, when Russell turned to Moore and said suddenly: ‘You don’t like me,Moore, do you?’ Moore pondered on this for a moment, and replied: ‘No.’ Thediscussion then turned to other topics. Wittgenstein found the whole business alittle mad. This division of the mind into neat compartments was beyond hiscomprehension.He did not devote himself entirely to mathematics. Music still remained one ofhis chief interests—he had been soaked in it throughout his childhood—and hecarried out experiments concerning rhythm in music, hoping it would throw somelight on the problems of aesthetics. In 1913, he went to Norway, and lived on afarm for a year. Like his fellow countryman Lenau (the romantic poet, who diedinsane in 1850), he had a pathetic belief in the ‘simple life’ (although henever went quite so far as to consider the backwoods of America as a suitablehome for a philosopher). In the 1914-18 war, he fought on the Eastern front, andlater in Northern Italy. When he was taken prisoner in 1918, he was carrying inhis knapsack the manuscript of his most famous book, the Logisch-PhilosophischeAbhandlung, the Discussion of Logic-Philosophy (whose English translation wasgiven the ponderous title Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus at the suggestion ofMoore). The manuscript was sent to Russell, and also to Keynes and Frege.Russell published an English translation (with an introduction that infuriatedWittgenstein) in 1922. An attempt at a summary of the Discussion must be leftuntil I have finished speaking of Wittgenstein’s life.When Wittgenstein came out of the army in 1919, one of the first things he didwas to give away all his money. His father’s death in 1912 had placed him inpossession of a considerable fortune. (There had been a period when he wasmaking Rilke an allowance—anonymously—although he professed not to admire hispoetry, claiming that it was artificial.) He then decided to become aschoolmaster; and actually did teach for six years in various remote villages inAustria.It is difficult to understand the full psychological process that lay behindthis action; perhaps one day, letters may be published which will give us acomplete insight into it. One reason is certainly that during the war he lostfaith in the ‘logic philosophy’ of Russell, and began to brood on the problemsof personality, free will, and the meaning of life and death. (The consequenceis that the Discussion is divided into two types of thinking, and only theearlier parts deal with logic.) But he had also read Tolstoy’s later works, andbeen greatly influenced by them, and had begun to study the Gospels. In theDiscussion, he had come to the conclusion that he had solved all the problems ofphilosophy. No doubt he felt that the next stage was spiritual exercise, asemi-religious self-discipline. His motive in becoming a schoolmaster must havehad something in common with T. E. Lawrence’s in entering the R.A.F.Six years of schoolmastering taught him that, in giving away his fortune, he hadonly deprived himself of leisure. His experiment in living among uneducatedvillagers was as unsuccessful as Van Gogh’s Borinage episode. They were trivialand annoying, and in 1926, he gave up schoolmastering for ever. He was nowwithout money, or means of supporting himself. One of his first thoughts was toenter a monastery—a wish that came to him many times in his life. He actuallydid go to work as a gardener’s assistant in a monastery near Vienna; but decidedthat his vocation was not for the religious life. He was now completely anOutsider, not knowing what to do or where he belonged. Luckily, one of hissisters came to the rescue, and asked him to design and build a house for her inVienna. He spent two years on this task, and the result was a severely beautifulstructure in concrete, glass and steel. During these two years, Wittgensteinalso became interested in sculpture, and developed considerable skill in themodelling of busts.In spite of his self-chosen seclusion, Wittgenstein was not completely cut offfrom the philosophical life of his time. A young Cambridge student, Frank Ramsey(who had done a brilliant review of the Discussion) came out to see him, and aViennese professor, Moritz Schlick, was deeply influenced by the Discussion andpersonal contact with him; Schlick belonged to the ‘Vienna circle’ of thinkers,the original logical positivists. But Wittgenstein himself was never a logicalpositivist. (Logical positivism—I should mention for uninformed readers—is akind of Marxist materialism in philosophy.)A lecture by Brouwer, the ‘intuitionist’ mathematician (intuition-ism might beroughly described as mathematical logical positivism), revived Wittgenstein’sinterest in philosophy, and in 1929, he returned to Cambridge. He obtained aPh.D. by presenting the Discussion as a thesis, and in 1930 was made a Fellow ofTrinity.During the next few years, he rejected many of the ideas of the Discussion, andbegan to build up an entirely new theory of language. This, like the Discussion,became the basis of the school of philosophy known as ‘linguistic analysis.’Wittgenstein has the unique distinction of being the founder of two out of thethree most important schools of thought in the past thirty years. The third, ofcourse, is existentialism; and, as I shall attempt to show, his whole outlookwas far closer to this than to either of the other two.In 1935, he considered settling down in Russia, but the idea was dropped—perhapson account of Stalin’s purges. But he visited Russia, and then visited Norwayagain, where he spent a year living alone in a hut. He began to write his secondbook, the Philosophical Investigations. He made several attempts to plan thisbook, but finally gave up, and left it as a series of notes and aphorisms(published posthumously in 1953). It is interesting to remember that Germanromantic philosophy in the nineteenth century tended to express itself in thisway (Novalis’s philosophical fragments, for instance), and that Kierkegaardchose the title Philosophical Fragments (or Crumbs) for one of his books toemphasise how much he disliked huge systematic books.In 1937, Wittgenstein succeeded Moore to the chair of philosophy at Cambridge.But he was a highly unorthodox professor. He gave his lectures in his rooms, andby all accounts they were not lectures, but discussions which he led. He neverwore a tie, but usually dressed in an old tweed jacket, or a leather lumberjacket with a zip over a soft shirt. He disliked Cambridge and the artificiallife there (he once told Karl Britton that when he heard one undergraduatesaying ‘Oh, really?’ to another, he knew he was back in Cambridge). He never ateat high table—he could not bear the smart conversation; on the one occasion whenhe dined there, he left with his hands over his ears, groaning ‘But they don’teven enjoy doing it.’ His rooms in Whewells Court were barely furnished with abed, a small table and a deck-chair, and he had no books (he felt that thereading of books simply stopped people from thinking for themselves). Moore andRussell still failed to feel much sympathy for his ‘Teutonic seriousness,’ andMoore attended his discussion groups wearing an expression of disapproval. (Helater admitted that he understood very little of what was said.) He wasdeveloping his idea that what is usually called philosophy is actually amisunderstanding of language. In the Investigations, he says: ‘Philosophy is abattle against the bewitchment of our senses by means of language.’1 What he wastrying to do in philosophy had something in common with what James Joyce wastrying to do in literature. Joyce did not want to write novels and extend hisrange through creation of situations; he wanted to find a new way of writingnovels, and plot and situation would have impeded him; he was experimenting withlanguage. So it was with Wittgenstein. The Discussion was his Ulysses: a sort ofmachine gun with which he mowed down all previous philosophical techniques. Itwould have been an anticlimax for him to start philosophising along the samelines as Russell, or even Whitehead. Instead, he concentrated on the problem ofa new way of philosophising, a new and rigorous use of language, a revitalisingof the language of philosophy. In the Investigations, he is still laying thefoundations before the act of philosophising.He was not happy as a Cambridge don; he considered giving up his position inorder to conduct music. When the war came, he accepted it as a relief fromlecturing, and came to London during the blitz. There, he took a job as ahospital porter at Guy’s. Later, he went up to Newcastle, and worked in amedical laboratory there. (There had been a time in the ’thirties when he haddecided to give up philosophy and study medicine; but the idea came to nothing.)In the Easter of 1947, he gave his last lectures at Cambridge, and once againthought about going into seclusion. This time, he decided on Ireland—the westcoast, near Galway. There he lived in a cottage, and continued work on theInvestigations. People who knew him there speak of his curious power over birds;a Galway resident has told me of seeing Wittgenstein with his head and shoulderscovered with birds, which flew off when he approached.Life in the cottage was too strenuous as winter came on, and in late 1948, hemoved to a Dublin hotel, where he finished the Investigations. In 1949, he wentto the United States on a visit, and then returned to Cambridge. There it wasdiscovered that he was suffering from a cancer. He died in April, 1951; the lastyears of his life had been spent in constant work, which continued up to a fewdays before his death. At the date of writing (1957), only one volume besidesthe Investigations has been published.I have already said that Wittgenstein believed that his Discussion had solvedall the problems of philosophy. A brief examination of the book will show why hethought so.There are, as I have said, two lines of thought in the Discussion. The first isa result of his study of Russell and Frege. There would be no point in trying tosummarise this aspect here, but his conclusions can be stated briefly. Allsignificant propositions, he maintains, are ‘truth functions’ of elementarypropositions. (A ‘truth function’ of a simple proposition is a proposition whosetruth depends only on the truth of the simple proposition: i.e. if the simpleproposition is ‘Hitler is dead,’ then the ‘truth function’ is a sentence like‘There is no Füehrer of Germany now that Hitler is dead.’) This led Wittgensteinto define ‘logical truth’ as tautology.However, this aspect of the Discussion is not important here, and I mention itonly for the sake of completeness. What is more important about the Discussionis that it sets limits to philosophy.Wittgenstein does this by defining language as a picture of reality. In otherwords, what is not real cannot be said.He then asks: What is real? and answers: All the facts of the universe. Hebegins the book ‘The world is everything that is the case,’ (i.e. the world iseverything of which one can say ‘This is true’—the world is all the facts in theuniverse).He then goes on (proposition 6.41—the Discussion is divided into numberedpropositions for clarity):> The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is> as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is no value ...> > Hence also there can be no ethical propositions. Propositions cannot express> anything higher. It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed ...> > 6.423. Of the will as the subject of the ethical we cannot speak.2In other words, language has no business trying to express propositions aboutethics, the Will, or life and death. If the meaning of the world lies outsidethe world, then it cannot be expressed in language, which only expresses what isin the world.Wittgenstein goes on to express certain thoughts about death, immortality, andkindred subjects:> Death is not an event of life. Death is not lived through.> > If by eternity is understood not endless temporal duration but timelessness,> then he lives eternally who lives in the present.8With these last words, the Discussion moves into the realm of the mystical.‘Living in the present’ does not mean Epicureanism; it means those momentsexperienced by Dostoevsky’s characters, when a single moment seems to be amillion years. Wittgenstein goes on to deny the concept of the immortality ofthe soul (in the Christian sense), and asks: ‘Is a riddle solved by the factthat I survive for ever?’4 He is, of course, attacking only what can be called‘naive Christianity,’ the spiritualist notion that life goes on unaltered inanother world after death. When Dante confesses that it is quite impossible toexpress the beatific vision in words, he is saying something with whichWittgenstein would agree completely. Or, as a certain logical positivist hasexpressed it: ‘What can’t be said can’t be said, and it can’t be whistledeither.’ (John Tanner, it will be remembered, raises the same point with EnryStraker in the second act of Man and Superman.) Wittgenstein asks:> Is this eternal life not as enigmatic as our present one? The solution of the> riddle of life in space and time lies outside space and time ...> > Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.5This is the mysticism of Kirilov in The Devils: the mere existence of anythingis a mystical fact—a leaf, a grain of sand. Wittgenstein goes on:> The feeling of the world as a limited whole is the mystical feeling.> > For an answer which cannot be expressed the question too cannot be expressed.> > The riddle does not exist.> > If a question can be put at all, then it can also be answered ...> > We feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered, the> problems of life have still not been touched at all. Of course there is then> no question left, and just this is the answer.> > The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of this problem.> > (Is not this the reason why men to whom ... the sense of life became clear,> could not then say wherein this sense consisted? )> > There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical.> > [Note this doctrine of the mystical which shows itself although it cannot be> expressed.]> > The right method of philosophy would be this. To say nothing except what can> be said, i.e. the propositions of natural science, i.e. something that has> nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to> say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning> to certain signs in his propositions. This method would be unsatisfying to the> other—he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy—but> it would be the only strictly correct method.> > My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally> recognises them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them,> over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up> on it.)> > He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.> > Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.6This is the last sentence of the Discussion. I have quoted the last three pagesfairly fully, but omitting to number the paragraphs. It is not a longbook—barely eighty pages long. In these eighty pages, however, Wittgenstein hasmanaged to say more than most philosophers in eight hundred. His paragraph about‘throwing away the ladder’ is obviously an attempt to anticipate an objection:that if all statements about the meaning of the world are nonsense, are notWittgenstein’s statements in the Discussion also nonsense? His admission thatthis is so does not ring true. If a statement is really nonsense, it is like aladder with no rungs, and one could not climb up it anyway. And if one can climbup it to some higher state of wisdom, then it is certainly not nonsense in thesense that Wittgenstein says metaphysics is nonsense. His statement bears someresemblance to the Buddhist doctrine of repeating the Sutras until their meaningis quite clear, and then no longer having to repeat them. Certainly, as aprofessor of philosophy, Wittgenstein tried to do what Nietzsche declared to behis own aim: to provoke people to think, not merely to accept what he told them.Let me briefly summarise Wittgenstein’s argument in the Discussion in order totry to elucidate these paragraphs. Language is a picture of reality—just as apicture of the stork on a Guinness advertisement is a representation of a realstork. Therefore, language can only picture what actually is. And what ‘is’? Allthe facts in the world; that is, not just all the things in the universe, butevery possible combination of those things.If there is a meaning of life, it must lie outside life; that is, it must lie inlife considered as a whole. Therefore, all metaphysics (which talks about God,purpose, good and evil, and so on) is meaningless: it cannot be expressed inlanguage. This does not mean that ‘God does not exist,’ or ‘There is no suchthing as sin.’ It only means that if one uses the word ‘God’ in a logicalsentence, it promptly takes the logic out of the sentence, and renders itmeaningless.The sentence ‘The riddle does not exist’ (i.e. the ‘riddle of life’) has beenseized on with delight by logical positivists as being a justification forconsidering all questions about the meaning of life as nonsense. They areignoring the fact that two paragraphs earlier, Wittgenstein speaks of the riddlequite plainly: ‘Is this eternal life not as enigmatic as our present one? Thesolution of the riddle ... lies outside space and time.’ And his last sentenceimplies that, as Dante says, a point comes where one cannot use words any more.A logical positivist has quoted this last sentence ‘Whereof one cannot speak,thereof one must be silent,’ and added: ‘That’s all right—provided we’re agreedthat there’s nothing to be silent about.’ Now Wittgenstein has stated veryplainly that there is something to be silent about. The logical positivist wasmerely making a statement about his own temperament—an Insider temperament—andwas trying to assert that it ought to fit the whole world. (This argument isconsidered at length by William James in The Varieties of Religious Experience.)The logical positivist interpretation of the Discussion, then, insists onignoring Wittgenstein’s plain statement that the ‘mystical’ does exist. But whatabout the other interpretation—the existentialist? Does this fit the Discussionany better?It does, as soon as it becomes apparent that there are certain sentences whichmust be added to the Discussion. The Discussion is about the scope of language.(Incidentally, Wittgenstein changed his mind about language being a ‘picture ofreality’ in the Investigations.) It assumes that philosophy can only beconducted in language, and that there are certain things which language cannotexpress. In this, Wittgenstein is obviously partly right. For instance,Kierkegaard set out to attack Hegel’s ponderous System because it was inhumanand cold, but wrote a great ponderous inhuman book about it himself (theUnscientific Postscript), thus defeating his own purposes. Heidegger tried to‘systematise’ existentialism, and has created an anomaly, an ‘existentialistsystem’ which is more unreadable than Hegel.In fact—and this is what I am trying to emphasise—the only way one can talkabout the problems of ‘meaning’ in life is by showing them in terms of livingpeople. Jaspers is a better existentialist than Heidegger, for at least he keepshis attention focussed on men like Van Gogh, Nietzsche, and Dostoevsky. Let mebe even more explicit. One cannot talk about the real issues of life: one canonly show them. Critical language, discursive language, has no meaning otherthan its logical meaning. But consider Coleridge’s Kubla Khan, Rilke’s Orpheussonnets, Eliot’s Ash Wednesday. This language has a meaning quite apart from the‘logical syntax’ of the sentences. ‘True poetry can communicate before it isunderstood,’ Eliot wrote in his essay on Dante. And one can go further, and say:What true poetry can communicate cannot be expressed in ordinary language.But there is a still more important point to be made here, and it is this:poetry can present certain mystical issues, but it cannot investigate them. Itcan only show them in the way that a flash of lightning lights up a landscape.Now Dostoevsky manages to convey far more of such issues in Crime and Punishmentand The Brothers Karamazov than even Dante was able to express in the Commedia,simply because, by examining them in terms of a number of Outsiders, he is ableto show the reader insights which he could not have expressed if he had beenwriting a philosophical treatise.True existentialism cannot be communicated in ordinary logical language; it canonly be expressed in the drama, in poetry (and it is no coincidence that Eliothas stated that all great poetry is dramatic in essence), in the novel. Trueexistentialism is the dramatic investigation of human nature through the mediumof art. The true existentialist philosopher is the ‘artist-philosopher’ of whomShaw spoke in Man and Superman.Only one more statement need be added to complete the circle of this argument: Aphilosophy which is not existentialist is only half a philosophy; it isphilosophy without arms or legs. All European philosophy since the seventeenthcentury has been a half-measure. An abstract philosopher is a half-man.All this is implied clearly in the Discussion. It is ironical, under thecircumstances, that the Discussion has become the textbook of the most bloodlesshalf-philosophy of the twentieth century.This is partly Wittgenstein’s own fault. He did not fully understand theimplications of his own book. Consider, for instance, his sentence about themeaning of life lying outside life, and being therefore unknowable. What does itreally mean? One could say, with perfect truth, that the shape of a gasometer isonly visible from outside the gasometer. The shape of the gasometer cannot be inthe gasometer. Neither can the meaning of life be in life. This is true enough.But this does not mean that a man in a gasometer would have to go outside to seethe shape of the gasometer. All he would have to do would be to turn on thelight inside. The shape would be as visible from inside as outside. So themeaning of life can be discerned, by mystical intuition, from inside.It is a commonplace of any religious philosophy that a point comes where one hasto stop talking and start submitting to discipline. Wittgenstein came tomaturity under the influence of Russell, who has always fostered the innocentbelief that one can talk one’s way to the depths of the universe; that logic isall-sufficient. The Discussion was Wittgenstein’s revolt against this view, as,indeed, was his life itself, with all the dissatisfaction and constant change,the fear of mental illness, the endless desire to try new ways ofself-expression. Engineer, scientist, mathematician, schoolteacher, monk,architect, sculptor, doctor, musician, workman ... Wittgenstein demonstratesperfectly that the Outsider’s problem is the problem of self-expression. At theend of the Discussion, he knew it was time to stop talking and start doing,submitting to the Outsider’s discipline. But like Van Gogh, Lawrence, andNijinsky, his ‘doing’ was not satisfactory.Wittgenstein was a creator manque. That was his problem. If he had gone on fromthe Discussion to write a Brothers Karamazov, to discipline himself until heachieved samadhi like Ramakrishna, to strive to achieve a state ofself-remembering, like Ouspensky, he would have followed the road toself-expression. He knew, as clearly as Gurdjieff knew, that the only purpose ofknowledge is to be more. He expresses this sense in PhilosophicalInvestigations, where he refuses to ‘philosophise,’ but instead conducts a longand painstaking examination into language, the instrument of philosophy. He knewthat a point comes where a man can use words brilliantly, but cannot changehimself. Knowledge, like art, has only one purpose: to show man his own face.When a schoolboy first learns how to use his mind, he uses it ecstatically; herevels in the power of his intellect. In this stage, the free use of hisintellect helps to change him, to develop him. But if he remains a cleverschoolboy, brilliant in mind, but immature emotionally and physically, he isworse off than a ploughman, who at least leads a well-balanced life.The twentieth century has produced this ‘clever schoolboy’ type of writer inabundance. (Bertrand Russell, Arthur Koestler, Aldous Huxley, are examples, butit would be unfair to pretend that they are the only examples.) And the ‘cleverschoolboy’ is a fitting image for Western civilisation, brilliant in mind, butimmature in all other things. We are too ‘clever’ in the worst sense of theword. When Shakespeare praised Brutus with the words ‘This was a man,’ heunderstood the basic condition of life—that it must be complete and balanced.And in order to survive, a civilisation has to be complete and balanced, too.Abstract philosophy is a symbol of Western civilisation. The Outsider is the manwho revolts instinctively against abstraction, against our infant-prodigycivilisation. The Outsider is the man who yearns for a return to ancientstandards—the standards which recognise that ‘cleverness’ is of the intellectalone, that wisdom is a complex of intellect, emotions and body.Wittgenstein, like all the Outsiders whom we have considered, must ultimately bereckoned a failure. The measure of how far he failed lies in the fact that thetwo schools which are associated with his teaching are logical positivism andlinguistic analysis. Linguistic analysis devotes its time to analysing what thephilosophers of the past have said, and objecting: ‘But you cannot say that,’ or‘That is meaningless ... ’ A recognition that abstract philosophy is basically ahalf-measure would save the linguistic analysts all this effort. There is nopoint in flogging a dead horse. But Wittgenstein himself failed because he couldnever resist the temptation of intellect. Intellect never wholly satisfied him,and he was always restless; yet he had to return to philosophising, toanalysing, because it was the path of least resistance for his mind. Intellecton its own is a triviality. Wittgenstein never completely surrendered to thattriviality; but he never had the strength and insight to put it behind him.After admitting that the really important things cannot be talked about, he wenton talking for the rest of his life.This is not intended to minimise Wittgenstein’s importance. He is one of themost important European thinkers since Descartes. Like Nietzsche, he always feltthat he was writing for a new type of man. It is certainly true that hissignificance is not yet fully realised, and will not be until everything he everwrote is published, and an exhaustive biography produced.Alfred North Whitehead was born twenty-eight years before Wittgenstein;nevertheless, I have chosen to speak of him later because his philosophy coversa wider ground than Wittgenstein’s, and can be better understood in the light ofwhat has been said about the Discussion. On the other hand, I do not propose totry to give a complete picture of Whitehead’s thought. His philosophy isdifficult and technical, and no purpose would be served by trying to present itfully here.There seems to be very little to tell about Whitehead’s life; what little thereis, he has recounted himself in half a dozen pages of autobiographical notes atthe beginning of the volume on him in the ‘Library of Living Philosophers.’ Hewas born in 1861 at Ramsgate, Kent, the son of a Protestant clergyman. Hischildhood was spent in contact with the idyllic world of a Trollope cathedraltown; in his autobiographical notes he manages to evoke the picturesquebackground against which he grew up: Richborough castle, built by the Romans,Ebbes Fleet, where the Saxons and Augustine landed, and the sixteenth- andseventeenth-century houses of Sandwich. He attended Sherborne school from theage of fifteen—a school which can claim Alfred the Great as a pupil, and whichhas ‘one of the most magnificent abbeys in existence, with tombs of Saxonprinces.’ Four years later, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge. UnlikeWittgenstein, he loved the place, and remained there for thirty years, first asa student, then as a don. He became a Fellow of Trinity in 1885, and, a littlelater, a senior lecturer in mathematics. One of his pupils was Bertrand Russell.He married in 1890, and the marriage was unusually successful. The Whiteheadslived in the Mill House at Grantchester—next door to the Old Vicarage, later tobe the home of Rupert Brooke. In 1910, they moved to London, and from then until1924, Whitehead taught first at University College, and then at the ImperialCollege of Science in Kensington. In 1924, he was invited to Harvard University.He lived and taught there until his death at the age of eighty-six in 1947. Hislife, on the whole, was serene and untroubled—the ideal life for a philosopher.Whitehead’s true stature is by no means fully recognised today, even in America,his adopted country. In England, most of his works are out of print, with theexceptions of Science and the Modern World and Adventures of Ideas (which can beobtained in Penguins) and a volume of his essays.Whitehead’s greatness lies in the fact that he began as a typical ‘abstractphilosopher,’ and gradually rejected ‘abstractionism,’ until he became one ofthe broadest and most profound minds since Plato.His writing can be divided into three periods: a mathematical period, ascientific period, a religious and metaphysical period. It is with the last ofthese that we are mainly concerned; but a brief summary of the first two may befound useful at this point.His first book, published when he was thirty-seven, was the Universal Algebra.It was not (as one might suppose from the title) a textbook for schools, but anattempt to invent a way of performing logical operations by means of symbols.Leibniz had first conceived this idea, reasoning that if the rules of thoughtcould be expressed by algebraic symbols, all logical thinking might eventuallybe accomplished by means of those symbols. Leibniz never carried through thisidea, but a century and a half later, a self-educated English schoolmaster namedBoole invented symbolic logic in a book called The Laws of Thought. Inspired byhim, and by a German called Grassmann, Whitehead tried to invent a set ofsymbols, whose purpose was that ‘all serious thought which is not philosophy ...or imaginative literature, shall be mathematics ... ’7 It is worth noting thatWhitehead does not include philosophy. Unlike Russell, he did not think thatphilosophy should be nothing but glorified logic.His second major work was a paper called Mathematical Concepts of the MaterialWorld, which contains some remarkable anticipations of Einstein’s generalrelativity theory. (Whitehead’s paper was read at the Royal Society in 1905, theyear in which Einstein’s first paper on relativity appeared.)In 1903, Russell had written his book Principles of Mathematics, which coveredsome of the same ground as the Universal Algebra, and now Russell and Whiteheaddecided to collaborate on producing a volume to systematise this idea of analgebra of logic. For the next six years, they worked in close harmony,producing the immense Principia Mathematica. Russell and Whitehead believed thatmathematics is simply a branch of logic, and that consequently all mathematicalconcepts can be reduced to logic. This the Principia Mathematica professes todo. But as the book is of extreme complexity, and even expert mathematiciansfind it difficult to follow, it is impossible to know whether or not it reallysucceeded. An example of the kind of logical problem which Russell and Whiteheadhad to surmount (a very famous problem which Russell was the first to recognise)is called the problem of sets that are members of themselves. (A set simplymeans a collection of objects: a tea set is a collection of tea things; anunderwear set is a collection of underwear.) There are two kinds of sets, whichcan be called ordinary and extraordinary. An extraordinary set is a set thatcontains itself as one of its own members. For instance ‘The set of all phrasesof eight words’ contains itself as a member, for it contains eight words. Butthis kind of set is unusual. Most sets do not contain themselves as members: theset of all square objects, the set of all obscene words, and so forth. These areordinary sets. Now consider the set of all ordinary sets, and call it C. Is C amember of itself? If the answer is No, then it cannot be the set of all ordinarysets. But if the answer is Yes, then C is an extraordinary set, and containsitself as a member. And this is contrary to the definition, which said that Cwas the set of all ordinary sets only.This kind of problem is not particularly profound or important; another famousexample is Epimenides’s paradox: If I say I lie and I do lie, then I tell thetruth; If I say I lie and really tell the truth, then I lie. Such exercisesrepresent a game which most mathematicians have ceased to play.From 1919 until 1922, Whitehead produced three books: The Principles of NaturalKnowledge, The Concept of Nature, and The Principle of Relativity. These are histhree ‘scientific books.’ They were an attempt to construct a philosophy ofNature; and he defined Nature as ‘that which we observe ... through the senses.’In other words, Whitehead treated Nature in the way which is anathema to theexistentialist, behaving as if it were something at the other end of atelescope. This method, which is natural to the scientist (for whom nature issomething at the other end of a telescope—or microscope) is the method of‘abstract philosophy.’ For Blake and Wordsworth, Nature was a living entity,which could only be understood if it was regarded as in some way a reflection ofGod, or the human spirit. Whitehead ploughed on with his analyses of space andtime and four-dimensional geometry, doing his best to create a completephilosophy of Nature, treating nature as the scientist treats it. But he soonbegan to find all kinds of difficulties arising. He discovered that, sooner orlater, the philosopher has to start talking about the mind observing Nature. Inthis limited space, it is impossible to explain how this came about (apart fromwhich, the three books in question are full of mathematical terminology, andquestions about space and time, objects and events, which would becomprehensible only to a reader with special knowledge of his earlier books).All that need be said here is that Whitehead came to feel that a purelyscientific approach to philosophy is an impossibility. His curious, probing mindbegan to ask questions about the role of the human observer in Nature. In thePrinciples of Natural Knowledge, he had written: ‘ ... none of our perplexitiesas to Nature will be solved by having recourse to the consideration that thereis a mind knowing it.’ 8 But more and more, in the course of the investigation,he found that the idea of ‘a mind knowing it’ could not be kept out. Not onlythat, but that there can be no idea of Nature without the idea of a mind knowingit.Where exactly does Whitehead’s ‘theory of relativity’ differ from Einstein’s?This question cannot be answered without assuming some slight knowledge ofEinstein’s theory. It will be remembered that Einsteinian relativity talks about‘the curvature of space,’ and other similar concepts; in fact, it claims thatspace can only be adequately understood by a mathematician. (These ideas of thecurvature of space, and the notion that space is ‘twisted’ around the objectsthat exist in it, have been popularised by Jeans and Eddington—also the ideathat space is really only the relation between material bodies, not a ‘thing’ inits own right.) Whitehead felt that the whole idea of ‘points’ in space isinadequate—you cannot mark a ‘point’ in space with your fountain pen, as you canmark a point on a sheet of paper. So for these ‘points’ of Einstein, hesubstituted the idea of events, and elaborated a theory of space as the relationbetween events. This is all that can be said without becoming unintelligible;but the idea is not particularly important for what I shall have to say aboutWhitehead. If Whitehead’s ideas ever become widely accepted, though, it may benecessary to revise Einstein’s theory completely.In The Principle of Relativity, Whitehead made a particularly importantstatement about the ‘bifurcation of nature.’ He comments that when the scientistknocks a molecule to pieces, he does not see a molecule, but a flash of light.The same scientist will then say: ‘Yes, this is what I saw happening [the flashof light], but what really happened is ... ’ He is making a sharp bifurcation(division) of the world into things as they really are and things as they seem.Whitehead protests: ‘Nature is ... a totality including individual experiences,so that we must reject the distinction between nature as it really is andexperiences of it which are purely psychological. Our experiences of theapparent world are nature itself.’9 [My italics.]We now come to Whitehead’s most important period, his metaphysical period, whichlasted until the end of his life. This is the period where Whitehead’s thoughtcan throw some light on the problems of the Outsider.In Science and the Modern World, the first book he wrote after becoming aHarvard professor, he launches his attack on ‘abstract philosophy’—an attackwhich was not to cease for the remaining quarter of a century of his life. Hestates: ‘My theme is the energising of a state of mind in the modern world ...and its impact upon other spiritual forces.’10 The phrase ‘energising of a stateof mind’ is particularly apt in this connection. That is just what happened whenscience began to develop: it gave the scientists tremendous mental energy—theenergy of idealism—the ideal of man becoming godlike through knowledge. WhatWhitehead sets out to show in Science and the Modern World is just why mankindhas not become ‘godlike’ through science.Even on the surface, Science and the Modern World is an unusual book; one doesnot expect to find Milton, Shelley, Wordsworth, the Bible, quoted in a volume onphilosophy; but from the beginning of this book, Whitehead’s mind ranges asfreely through literature and philosophy as Toynbee’s. (Whitehead and Toynbeehave a great deal in common as thinkers.) Its argument is one which has nowappeared many times in the course of this book, that the result of placing toomuch weight on intellect alone is lopsided confusion. If Whitehead had beenacquainted with Spengler and Toynbee, he might have added that this confusion isthe direct cause of the decline of our civilisation.He puts the problem with unexampled clarity. Scientific materialism ends withthe view that there is no mind, only matter, and ‘spirit’ is an outcome ofmatter. Berkeley went to the other extreme, and said there was no matter, onlymind. Berkeley was a bishop, and he was attempting to refute the materialisticview of the universe. The truth, Whitehead says, lies between the two. Completematerialism denies that man has any free will. It asserts that the human bodyand the human mind are subject to the ‘laws of nature,’ and that nature is dead.There is only one clear logical alternative: to state that nature is alive, thatthe human body is more alive, and that the human mind is more alive still; thatlife pervades the whole of nature as the ‘ether’ was once supposed to pervadethe whole of space. (This, of course, is the Shavian view, expressed in Back toMethuselah.) Whitehead denies that his doctrine of ‘organism’ (this is what hecalls his idea) is the same thing as ‘vitalism.’ But he is only denying thevalidity of Bergson’s vitalism, in which life squeezes its way into matterthrough the tiny gap called ‘living bodies.’ (A man is a ‘higher being’ simplybecause he is a bigger hole than an animal.) Whitehead conceives the whole ofnature as a single organism, like one living body—as Shaw does in Methuselah—andall events in it as ‘biological cells.’ (He speaks of events rather than objectsbecause he thinks of nature as a four-dimensional continuum.)What Whitehead is attempting to do in Science and the Modern World is to assertthat the poets are right, and the scientists wrong. The ‘nature’ that Wordsworthloved and worshipped is closer to the reality than the ‘nature’ that Newtontalks about. But Whitehead is not willing to leave it at that. He wants to buildan unassailable ‘scientific’ doctrine of nature which conforms to the insightsof poets like Shelley and Wordsworth. This is the essence of his ‘philosophy oforganism.’It can hardly have failed to strike readers that Whitehead’s aim and my own (inThe Outsider) have a great deal in common. Both views begin with a rejection ofscientific materialism (and its natural rejection of religion) and an appeal tothe psychological foundations of common sense. One cannot ignore half of lifefor the purposes of science, and then claim that the results of science give afull and adequate picture of the meaning of life. All discussions of ‘life’which begin with a description of man’s place on a speck of matter in space, inan endless evolutionary scale, are bound to be half-measures, because they leaveout most of the experiences which are important to us as human beings. Thegeneral feeling of the scientist—the ‘abstract philosopher’ who would like totie up the universe into a neat parcel—is that ‘art’ is irrelevant, a meremeaningless by-product of our animal functions. Compare this attitude with thatof Beethoven, who said, ‘He who understands my music will not be tormented bythe ordinary difficulties of life.’ Beethoven felt that he, as a man, had usedmusic to gain a certain power over his own life—over the complexity of his ownexperience—and that his music, apprehended intuitively, would teach other peopleto gain the same mastery.And here we come to one of the most important concepts in Whitehead, the conceptwhich forms his link with existentialism, and with the idea of Bildung in Goethe(and Goethe, it must be remembered, also believed that all nature is a singleliving organism)—Whitehead’s idea of prehension. This can be best defined byquoting a passage from his last book, Modes of Thought:> ... the notion of life implies a certain absoluteness of self-enjoyment. This> must mean a certain immediate individuality, which is a complex process of> appropriating into a unity of existence the many data presented as relevant by> the physical processes of nature. Life implies the absolute, individual> self-enjoyment arising out of this process of appropriation. I have, in my> recent writings, used the word ‘prehension’ to express this process of> appropriation. Also I have termed each individual act of immediate> self-enjoyment an ‘occasion of experience.’ I hold that these unities of> existence, these occasions of experience, are the really real things which ...> compose the evolving universe, ever plunging into the creative advance.11 [My> italics.]Prehension, in other words, is the act of reaching out to grasp experience. That‘hunger for experience’ of which Henry James speaks in Isabel Archer and MillyTheale is a prehensive hunger. Wilhelm Meister’s process of self-education was aprocess of prehension. Prehension is that act of the soul, reaching out like anoctopus to digest its experience. When Evan Strowde asked ‘How can the spirit ofman gain power over his prosperity?’ he might have expressed himself, ‘How canthe spirit of man prehend his prosperity?’ Prehension is the act of gainingpower over experience. The only question in which existentialism is interestedwith regard to a human being is: Master or slave? Master of his own complexity,or the slave of it? Prehension is the most fundamental activity of life. Man isa higher type of creature than the amoeba simply because he has developed agreater power of prehension: an ability to master his own chaos. When, inMethuselah, Pygmalion’s male creature (whom he had made in his laboratory) dieswith the words: ‘I am discouraged. Life is too heavy a burden,’ he is confessinghis inability to make an act of prehension of the complex world of A.D. 31,920.Shaw’s term ‘discouragement’ (which first occurs in the fourth part of theMethuselah cycle) is the natural counterpart of Whitehead’s prehension.Prehension, then, is the most fundamental term of an existentialist philosophy.It means the same as Goethe’s Bildung, but it has a far wider meaning than theterm ‘education.’ Education means a conscious addition to knowledge. Bildung hasa far wider sense of ‘growing to maturity.’ To a large extent, this growing tomaturity is unconscious; the amount of conscious effort most of us make to growis minimal. But Elijah’s protest about being no wiser than his fathers (withwhich I began this book) underlines the fact that man grows for a limited periodonly, and then stops; beyond that, a conscious effort of prehension is needed.And what man ‘prehends’ are the actual units of his living experience, whichWhitehead calls ‘events,’ or ‘occasions of experience.’In 1926, Whitehead produced one of his shortest, yet most important books,Religion in the Making. He states his aim in the first paragraph—to consider thejustification for belief in doctrines of religion. He goes on to draw attentionto the difference between religion and arithmetic. Arithmetic dawned on the mindof man over a long period as a simple form of objective truth: ‘One cow plus twocows makes three cows.’ But religion never ‘dawned’ as objective truth; it wasalways an internal condition in man. One can hold mathematical truths at arm’slength and look at them; but religion is tangled up with man’s insides, and mannever knows himself as well as he knows that one and one make two. Religion isman’s relation to life and death, and is a function of the parts of him that heknows least about: the will, the sense of purpose:> Religion is force of belief cleansing the inward parts. For this reason the> primary religious virtue is sincerity, a penetrating sincerity ... Religion is> the art and the theory of the internal life of man ... 12Whitehead denies that religion is primarily a social fact, and asserts its realsignificance in Outsider terminology:> ... most psychology is herd-psychology. But all collective emotions leave> untouched the awful ultimate fact, which is the human being, consciously alone> with itself, for its own sake ... Religion is what the individual does with> his own solitariness ... Thus religion is solitariness; and if you are never> solitary, you are never religious.12 [My italics.]And finally, at the conclusion of one of the most penetrating studies ofreligion since James’s Varieties of Religious Experience, Whitehead writes: ‘Godis that function in the world by reason of which our purposes are directed toends which in our own consciousness are impartial as to our own interests. He isthat element in life in virtue of which judgement stretches beyond facts ofexistence to values of existence.’13 The ‘facts of existence,’ that ‘irreducibleand stubborn fact’ which he wrote about at the beginning of Science and theModern World, comprise the element that makes for meaninglessness—as whenSartre’s Roquentin sat on the bench and felt that it was grotesque, shapeless,nameless. If the mind had lost its power of prehension, all nature would looklike that seat; failure of prehension is ‘la nausée.’ God is expressed in natureas this endless effort of prehension. This effort of prehension is not, asWhitehead points out, anything to do with our immediate personal needs; it isfor something altogether greater. A man becomes great in so far as he expressesthe will of God, which is an eternal act of prehension in life.Whitehead’s major statement of his position is made in the immense volumeProcess and Reality, published in 1929. This is by far Whitehead’s mostimportant book, but one which it is impossible to summarise in a study as briefas this. He begins with his well-known statement that ‘philosophy is theendeavour to frame a coherent, logical, necessary system of general ideas interms of which every element of our experience can be interpreted.’14 Note thephrase ‘every element’—that is, not just the things we can reason about, but thesensation of listening to music, the effect of a painting, those moments ofwhich Proust speaks when the past is suddenly evoked by a casual word or action.Whitehead never thought of philosophy as a strictly limited field, asWittgenstein did. He declared that philosophy should be the critic ofabstractions, serving to keep abstractions in their proper place, and‘completing them by comparison with more concrete intuitions of the universe.’15And in Modes of Thought, he states what he means by ‘concrete intuitions’:> Nothing can be omitted, experience drunk and experience sober, experience> sleeping and experience waking, experience drowsy and experience wide-awake,> experience self-conscious and experience self-forgetful, experience> intellectual and experience religious and experience sceptical, experience> anxious and experience care-free, experience anticipatory and experience> retrospective, experience happy and experience grieving, experience dominated> by emotion and experience under self-restraint, experience in the light and> experience in the dark, experience normal and experience abnormal.16Wittgenstein’s retort to this would be, probably, that so far no language hasbeen invented which could incorporate all these things into a philosophy. Hemight agree, though, (and Whitehead certainly would) that the novelist is betterqualified to absorb all this experience than the philosopher. Shakespeare orTolstoy have come far closer to it than Hegel.After Science and the Modern World, Whitehead’s most readable book is Adventuresof Ideas. The knotty, difficult prose of Process and Reality is dropped, andonce again there is an abundance of illustration from literature, philosophy,and many other sources. The book is an application of Whitehead’s philosophy oforganism to various fields of practical human experience; there is a longsection on sociology, and another on civilisation. It is not an easy book toread—nothing Whitehead wrote ever was—but it shows Whitehead extending his fieldsteadily, taking a widening interest in all sorts of subjects apart fromphilosophy. After this, Whitehead had only one more major work ahead of him,Modes of Thought (1938), a restatement of the way in which his views haddeveloped since Science and the Modern World. It contains the passage I quotedabove about ‘experience,’ which shows Whitehead taking a view of philosophywhich is broader than any conception since Plato. We cannot imagine Descartes,Leibniz, or Kant writing such a passage, although it would not surprise us inGoethe.Whitehead’s final position can be taken from an essay called Immortality,delivered in 1941 at the Harvard Divinity School. It is not, as one mightsuppose, an attempt to prove that man has an immortal soul, or survives afterdeath. Whitehead states that the world in which we live is a world of chaos,purposelessness, mortality. It is the World of Value which is the timelessworld. Plato’s works mean as much to us today as when he wrote them 2500 yearsago, although Plato the man is dead. Men have this power of transmitting valuewhich is greater than their individual physical selves: ‘Creation aims at Value,whereas Value is saved from the futility of abstraction by its impact upon theprocess of Creation. But in this fusion, Value preserves its Immortality. Inwhat sense does creative action derive Immortality from Value? This is the topicof our lecture.’17 Now Whitehead begins to state the views which we find inSpengler: that the philosopher must be the man of action. White-head developsthe idea in his own calm, slightly demure way, so that it does not seem toexpress the same notion as Spengler’s angry self-assertion. But it does,nevertheless:> The notion of Effectiveness cannot be divorced from the understanding of the> World of Value. The notion of a purely abstract self-enjoyment of values apart> from any reference to effectiveness in action was the fundamental error> prevalent in Greek philosophy ... and ... is not unknown in the modern world> of learning.18Although he uses a very different terminology, Whitehead is making the samepoint as Undershaft:> Value is saved from the futility of abstraction by its impact upon ...> Creation.He restates his notion of organism with complete clarity: ‘The misconceptionwhich has haunted philosophic literature throughout the centuries is the notionof “independent existence.” There is no such mode of existence; every entity isonly to be understood in terms of the way in which it is interwoven with therest of the Universe.’19Whitehead goes on to say that ‘personal identity’ is the fusion of the World ofValue with the World of Activity; in fact, the human being is a manifestation ofthe world of value in the world of activity; and the greater the man, the more‘value’ he manifests.This ‘world of value’ of which Whitehead speaks is the concept of life in Shaw.For Shaw, life is all-pervasive in space and time, but can only manifest itselfby inserting itself into matter and by imposing its own world of order andpattern on the chaos of matter. The fact that there are ‘laws of nature’ at allis a manifestation of life. If life did not pervade space and time, the universeof matter would be tohu bohu, complete chaos. The fact that the earth circlesaround the sun is a manifestation of life. This is also Whitehead’s concept oforganism.Whitehead’s analysis now begins to touch on the realms of the ‘mystical’:> Our sense-experiences are superficial, and fail to indicate the massive> self-enjoyment derived from internal bodily functioning. Indeed human> experience can be described as a flood of self-enjoyment, diversified by a> trickle of conscious memory and conscious anticipation.20Whitehead’s way of expressing it is so flat and matter-of-fact that thestartling content of this sentence is likely to escape us. In Dostoevsky’s TheDevils, Kirilov had expressed the same idea: that at a certain moment, he knewthat everything was good, and had stopped the clock to remind himself of therecognition. In Camus’s L’Etranger, Meursault knows, on the point of death, that‘I had been happy, and I was happy still.’ Whitehead has put his finger on theessence of all the sudden moments of illumination:> While on the shop and street I gazed> > My body of a sudden blazed;> > And twenty minutes more or less> > It seemed, so great my happiness,> > That I was blessed and could bless.21Whitehead goes on to summarise the role of memory and anticipation. Withoutmemory, life is a flat train of events; a man without memory would be no betterthan an imbecile. But as soon as there is memory, no matter how faint, ‘there isa reaction against mere ... material domination. Thus the universe is materialin proportion to the restriction of memory and anticipation.’22 Memory is theinstrument of man’s consciousness; memory, as Proust knew, is the key toprehension. The struggle of life to assert itself into the world of activity bymeans of memory and consciousness is the ultimate definition of the ideal ofheroism. The heroic is the struggle of Value against the unmeaning. TheOutsider’s lust for the heroic is the lust of life itself.Whitehead ends his lecture by re-emphasising the principles of his idea oforganism. He asserts that there are no such things as ‘independent existences,’and no such thing as ‘the adequate description of a finite fact.’ Everything istied up with everything else. He fires off one big gun into the air, when itstarget might well have been Marxism or logical positivism:> Much philosophic thought is based upon the faked adequacy of some account of> various modes of human experience ...> > Understand that I am not denying the importance of the analysis of experience:> far from it. The progress of human thought is derived from the progressive> enlightenment produced thereby. What I am objecting to is the absurd trust in> the adequacy of our knowledge. The self-confidence of learned people is the> comic tragedy of civilisation.> > There is not a sentence which adequately states its own meaning. There is> always a background of presupposition which defies analysis by reason of its> infinitude.23 [My italics.]He finishes with a summary of his whole life’s thought:> The conclusion is that Logic, conceived as an adequate analysis of the advance> of thought, is a fake. It is a superb instrument, but it requires a background> of common sense ...> > My point is that the final outlook of Philosophic thought cannot be based upon> the exact statements which form the basis of special sciences.> > The exactness is a fake.24Since the seventeenth century, this bogy of abstract thought has reignedunchallenged. The twentieth century tried to turn it into an algebra; andWhitehead was one of the men involved in the attempt. He has also been the manwho has shown that abstract thought is inadequate. He was not, like Blake, a‘mere poet’; he was a mathematician and scientist of formidable qualifications.It is one of the miracles of the history of philosophy that a man who began asan ‘abstract philosopher’ should have ended by expressing the attitude of theprophetic visionary.Whitehead’s thought is extremely difficult, and his prose style is not alwaysall that could be asked; consequently, the foregoing summary is bound to seempuzzling. I am also conscious that I have not succeeded in making Whitehead’sthought seem attractive to readers who approach it for the first time.Nevertheless, it is my own conviction that he will one day be regarded as theoutstanding philosopher of the twentieth century; and the attempt to present himin summary had to be made. England is always singularly unfair to its thinkers;if Whitehead had been a German, he would have had a special department of someuniversity dedicated to expounding his thought.What is surprising—even in view of the English indifference to metaphysics—isthat no one has noticed that Whitehead has created his own kind ofexistentialism; and that it is fuller and more adequate than that of anyContinental thinker. He was his own Hegel and Kierkegaard rolled into one.Science and the Modern World is the Unscientific Postscript of the twentiethcentury—with the additional advantage of being readable.Whitehead continues the dialectic of Dostoevsky’s beetle-man; theanti-rationalist argument. But Whitehead does not dismiss logic, in spite of hisassertion that it is a fake. He states its function with precision in one of hisearliest books, the Introduction to Mathematics in the Home University Library.It is a way of taking shortcuts, a way of saving valuable creating-time:> It is a profoundly erroneous truism ... that we should cultivate the habit of> thinking of what we are doing ... Civilisation advances by extending the> number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about> them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle—they are> strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made> at decisive moments.25Logic is meant to save time, and to give us additional freedom—but hereZarathustra’s question arises: Freedom for what? The mere logical philosopherhoards time as a miser hoards money, and his logic is directed to no otherpurpose; but unfortunately, time saved cannot be spent later. Without creation,all time is waste.I began this book by admitting that ‘the Outsider’ is of interest to me becauseof my own obsession with the problems of mental strain, of extreme psychologicalstates; yet during the course of this book, I have moved further and furtheraway from questions of human psychology into the realm of ideas. I am awarethat, in doing this, I have left the problems of a Van Gogh, a Dostoevsky and aNijinsky far behind. And yet there is a kind of logic in this. The chief problemof life is not to learn how to think correctly, but simply to live. The thinkingcapacity cannot march forward on its own. Like a mountain guide, it is tied by adouble rope to its companions, the emotions and the body. It can go so far andno further. Then the other two have to be induced to follow it before it canadvance. At the end of The Outsider, I still had a great deal of rope left; Ihave now gone as far as my two companions will allow.The Outsider was an attempt to argue the thesis that man is not complete withouta religion. The inspiration of the book was William James’s Varieties ofReligious Experience. James had also, in his own way, attempted to do whatPascal, Hulme and Whitehead have attempted. His argument amounts to this: Man isat his most complete when his imagination is at its most intense. Imagination isthe power of prehension; without it, man would be an imbecile, without memory,without forethought, without power of interpreting what he sees and feels. Thehigher the form of life, the greater its power of prehension; and in man,prehension becomes a conscious faculty, which can be labelled imagination. Iflife is to advance yet a stage higher, beyond the ape, beyond man the toiler oreven man the artist, it will be through a further development of the power ofprehension. This craving for greater intensity of imagination is the religiousappetite.Naturally, this is always bound up with the idea of the heroic. Even the heroismof Hemingway’s novels has an ultimate religious significance.This is the point at which I began The Outsider. My thesis was that religionbegins with the stimulus which heroism supplies to the imagination. TheOutsiders of the early chapters were men with hunger for heroism, stranded in anunheroic age. Their ‘abnormalities’ as Outsiders were their attempts tomanufacture their own ‘heroism.’ Roquentin’s complaint was that ‘There’s noadventure,’ and he implied that this is necessarily true in a moderncivilisation.I tried to show that the craving for greater intensity of imagination (whichmeans precisely the same as greater intensity of life: ‘to have life moreabundantly’) takes the form of a search for the heroic. This craving for theheroic was quite plainly visible in the lives of Van Gogh, T. E. Lawrence,Rimbaud, Gauguin. (Guido Ruggiero referred to Gauguin and Rimbaud as‘existentialist saints,’ and stated—with complete accuracy—that existentialismtreats life in the manner of a thriller.) Hector Hushabye in Heartbreak House isthe symbol of the hero in the modern age—mollycoddled by a highly efficienttechnical civilisation, driven to act out his heroism in imagination—the herobecome the buffoon.I tried to show the way in which heroism is the basis of the lives of all greatreligious figures. When George Fox left his Leicestershire home to tramp theroads as an itinerant preacher, he was inspired by the heroic example of Jesus.It was Jesus’s value as a hero which made him the centre around whichDostoevsky’s work revolved. The saint’s self-torture, his renunciation of theworld, is also heroic.Nietzsche knew that the ideal of ‘universal peace’ is a false ideal; man willalways attempt to create opportunities for the heroic. The wars of the twentiethcentury are the expression of a widespread subconscious craving. Kierkegaard wasright when he said that boredom is the real evil of the world. A religion is thereceptacle of the heroic, the symbol of man’s need to strive for prehension.Failure of religion and world wars are inevitable companions.This was the theme of The Outsider. The book ended with a question: What can bedone? But it also indicated plainly the direction which the argument had totake. (One American reviewer stated that my next critical book would undoubtedlybe my own ‘recipe for a new religion.’)The analysis, in this book, has been forced to widen its scope. The Outsider hadto be considered as a phenomenon of modern civilisation. The conclusion arrivedat is that he is a symptom of a civilisation in decline; but that at least, heis a healthy sign.I believe every civilisation reaches a moment of crisis, and that Westerncivilisation has now reached its moment. I believe that this crisis presents itschallenge: Smash, or go on to higher things. So far, no civilisation has evermet this challenge successfully. History is the study of the bones ofcivilisations that failed, as the pterodactyl and the dinosaur failed.In the second part of this book, I have tried to show why the Western world hasreached its moment of crisis. I have tried to show how religion, the backbone ofcivilisation, hardens into a Church that is unacceptable to Outsiders, and theOutsiders—the men who strive to become visionaries—become the Rebels. In ourcase, the scientific progress that has brought us closer than ever before toconquering the problems of civilisation, has also robbed us of spiritual drive;and the Outsider is doubly a rebel: a rebel against the Established Church, arebel against the unestablished church of materialism. Yet for all this, he isthe real spiritual heir of the prophets, of Jesus and St. Peter, of St.Augustine and Peter Waldo. The purest religion of any age lies in the hands ofits spiritual rebels. The twentieth century is no exception.Nietzsche and Shaw both believed that the force behind life aims at the creationof higher and higher types of men—and ultimately, at the Superman, or Saint, orgod. They believed that life aims at this god-creation slowly and inevitably, asa glacier moves. But the conclusions of the present book point to a differentpattern. Every time a civilisation reaches its moment of crisis, it is capableof creating some higher type of man. Its successful response to the crisisdepends upon the creation of a higher type of man. Not necessarily theNietzschean Superman, but some type of man with broader consciousness and adeeper sense of purpose than ever before. Civilisation cannot continue in itspresent muddling, shortsighted way, producing better and better refrigerators,wider and wider cinema screens, and steadily draining men of all sense of a lifeof the spirit. The Outsider is nature’s attempt to counterbalance this death ofpurpose. The challenge is immediate, and demands response from every one of uswho is capable of understanding it.Under the circumstances, it would be merely silly to speak of ‘remedies.’ It istoo early even to speak of a final diagnosis. In the most important chapter ofThe Outsider, ‘The Attempt to Gain Control,’ I spoke of three types ofdiscipline: the intellectual, the physical and the emotional, epitomised by T.E. Lawrence, Nijinsky and Van Gogh. Our civilisation, it would seem, issuffering from Lawrence’s disease: too much intellect, and the consequentstarvation of the emotional and physical factors. Existentialism is a protest onbehalf of completeness, of balance. But it is difficult enough to prescribe forthe individual Outsider; almost impossible to prescribe for the civilisation.Nevertheless, existentialism clearly plays the same role in the twentiethcentury that Christianity played in the Roman Empire in the first century. Theparallel cannot be pressed. It is only suggested as a bulwark against completepessimism.The solution, as always, is for the individual Outsider to continue to try tobring new consciousness to birth. The circumstances are at least less depressingthan they might be. Compared to the situation after the First World War, theyseem distinctly hopeful. There is a taste of intellectual revolt in the air. Andyet the burden remains upon the individual Outsider. There can be no easy‘engagement’—even if the situation is unprecedentedly serious. If our age doesstand on the edge of a last decline, like Greek civilisation in Plato’s time,the Outsider can only watch it with scientific curiosity, and continue—likePlato—to meditate on less immediate problems. This detachment is the basiccondition of survival; it is the sign of ultimate optimism:> All things fall and are built again,> > And those that build them again are gay.26Yeats had written of three old Chinamen looking down on the dissolution of acivilisation; their attitude is the answer to the Outsider’s question ofengagement:> On all the tragic scene they stare.> > One asks for mournful melodies;> > Accomplished fingers begin to play.> > Their eyes mid many wrinkles, their eyes,> > Their ancient, glittering eyes, are gay."},{"pageContent":"NOTESWherever British and American editions are both cited, page references are tothe British edition.An Autobiographical Introduction1.
