Only a few weeks . ago on one of my periodic trips to town I was looking for somewhere to stay. A girl with whom I was drinking in a Soho bar said : \" Come on back to my place. \" · \"Won't your landlady mind? . \" I ask-ed. She seemed vastly amused by this suggestion. Soon I was to find out why .... At one in the morning we drove to a narrow road be- tween Chelsea and World's End. We climbed three :flights of uncarpeted sta.irs and went into an enormous L-shaped room. From outside it sounded as if there was a pal\"ty going on, but when we got inside I dJs- covered tiha.t the music was being made by a long-haired Beatnik strumming a guitar. About ten people were lying , around on cushions or an mas- sive camp beds , and. one of them was reading alO'Ud, from a bulk1J manuscript. It seemed to be a kind of poetry without metres. Whole floor The girl (whom I will call ~ Ji{yra) told me tba.t he ha~ · j ust com:plet\"ed a. lonrP .poem- \" aiming a.t tJhe overthrow of civilisation \" and was reading it . to flamenco music, which suited its mood. ,,.. --- .. - I BEATNIKS by Colin At present researching the craze -for a new novel hookah. For 10s. the beat can buy enough \" tea \" to get high. It produces a sensation like rising up a. narrow chimney and hovering high in the air. The body becomes heavy, and everything h8Appens in slow motion. The English beats are fond of preludin, the stimulant that has the opposite effect to marijuana . · These \" slimmll.ng tablets \" de- stroy the desire to eat and produce an extraordinary menta.l brilliance; many beat poets write their poetry with t_he use of preludlin. The reswt is work of great sen- sitivity and strangeness, but with no thought of coherency. But beat philosophy is not merely drug-taking and sexual promiscuity. The founder of the b eat generation in America was Jack Kerouac whose novel. On the Road. started it all. According to Kerouac, beat c\\oes not mean \"down and out\" · it's derived from \"beatific \" a.nd refers to sainthood. ' -, The ~ts a.re devoted to the Eastern religion zen , which ' believes that the waiy to achieve sainthood 'and \" en- iightenmen .t \" is to give the instinot full play. At the moment there are four great centres of beat philo- sophy in England : Soho, Hampstead, Chelsea, and ox- ford. The beats from Oxford are likely to turn up in t he rooms of their friends in London, and sleep the night on the floor or share marijuana cigarettes And the Soho and Chelsea types often des· cend on Oxford. The University ' authori ti es re- gard the whole movement without favour. The beats have their own terminology. The males are known as beatniks, the females as beat-chiks. You call everybody \"man,\" al- though :.he women are some- times addressed as \" kid.\" fhere a.re two types of bea t- niks : The \" wild cat\" and the \"cool cat .\" The beats I have desert.bed above are -typical of \"the wild cat. Th ey believe in complete self ex- Wilson pression, in do ing anything that comes into your head, from turning somersault8 in the stree t to jiving to two differertt jazz records played at the same time. The cool cat tends to spend hl.1 time alone. He spends a great deal of time sitting cross-legged and star- ing at the wall as he tries to get the \" true source of in- spiration in himself. He is a mystic whose creed is to \" dig \" everything, and he is likely to declare that a dust- bin is iust as beautiful as a treeful of birds · The beat philosoph y is the leftover of the Angry Young Man craze of the 50's, of which (to our amazemen t) John Osborne and myself were regarded as the founder members. But it is easier t.o be b~ats than to be \" angry.\" To be angry . you needed something to get excited a.bout. To be beat you only need to sit back and drink your Spanish burgundy anct call everybody \" man.\" l am told that most beatniks end by taking a regular job and getting married. I give the whole craze another three _ years."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":",:. , .. i:'rr-alllL1f ig.?'1'.1.t tJrRf-: 'OVennrow ui: ·- .
