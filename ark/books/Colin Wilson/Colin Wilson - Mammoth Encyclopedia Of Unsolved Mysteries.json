He was discussing one of the great unsolved mysteriesof prehistory, the sudden disappearance of the dinosaurs about sixty-fivemillion years ago. He suggested that the dinosaurs had been wiped out by theexplosion of a star fairly close to our solar system – a “supernova”. He thenwent on to make the even more startling suggestion that the explosion may havebeen deliberately caused by superbeings who wanted to wipe out the dinosaurs andto give intelligent mammals a chance.Even the first part of his theory was dismissed by scientists as the fantasy ofa crank, and the reaction was no better when in 1970 Bergier repeated it in abook called Extra-Terrestrials in History, which began with a chapter called“The Star that Killed the Dinosaurs”. But five years later an American geologistnamed Walter Alvarez was studying a thin layer of clay on a hill side in Italy –the clay that divides the age of the dinosaurs (Mesozoic) from our own age ofmammals – and brooding on this question of what had wiped out whole classes ofanimal. He took a chunk from the hillside back to California, and showed it tohis father, the physicist Luis Alvarez, with the comment: “Dad, that half-inchlayer of clay represents the period when the dinosaurs went out, and about 75per cent of the other creatures on the earth”.His father was so intrigued that he subjected the clay to labouratory tests, andfound it contained a high proportion of a rare element called iridium, a heavyelement that usually sinks to the middle of planets, but which is thrown out byexplosions. Alvarez also gave serious consideration to the idea of an explodingstar, and only dismissed it when further tests showed an absence of a certainradioactive platinum that would also be present in a supernova explosion. Theonly other alternative was that the earth had been struck by a giant meteorite,which had filled the atmosphere with steam and produced a “greenhouse effect”that had raised the temperature by several degrees.Modern crocodiles and alligators can survive a temperature of about 100 degreesC; but two or three degrees higher is too much for them, and they die. This isalmost certainly what happened to the dinosaurs, about sixty-five million yearsago. And that is why this present book contains no entry headed: “What became ofthe dinosaurs”? We know the answer. And we also know that Bergier’s “lunaticfringe” theory was remarkably close to the truth.This is the basic justification for a volume like this. It underlines the pointthat it is always dangerous to draw a sharp, clear line between “lunacy” andorthodox science. In the article on spontaneous human combustion, I have quoteda modern medical textbook which states that spontaneous combustion isimpossible, and that there is no point in discussing it. But the evidence is nowoverwhelming that spontaneous combustion not only occurs, but occurs fairlyfrequently.In 1768 the French Academy of Sciences asked the great chemist Lavoisier toinvestigate a report of a huge stone that had hurtled from the sky and burieditself in the earth not far from where some peasants were working. Lavoisier wasabsolutely certain that great stones did not fall from the sky, and reportedthat the witnesses were either mistaken or lying; it was another half centurybefore the existence of meteorites was accepted by science.The “poltergeist”, or noisy ghost, is even more commonplace than spontaneoushuman combustion; at any given moment there are hundreds of cases going on allover the world. Yet in America scientists have formed a kind of defensive leaguecalled CSICOP (Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of theParanormal) whose basic aim is to argue that the “paranormal” simply does notexist, and is an invention of cranks and “pseudos”. Anyone who has taken eventhe most superficial interest in the paranormal knows that such a view is notmerely untenable, but that it represents a kind of wilful blindness.Let us be quite clear about this. I am not arguing that scepticism isfundamentally harmful. Reason is the highest faculty possessed by human beings,and every moment of our lives demands a continuous assessment of probabilities.Our lives depend upon this assessment every time we cross a busy street. I haveto judge the likelihood of that car or bus reaching me before I can step on tothe opposite pavement. And when a scientist is confronted by the question ofwhether, let us say, an Israeli “psychic” can bend keys by merely stroking them,he can only appeal to his general experience of keys and try to assess theprobabilities. Yet I think every scientist would agree that it would be wrong tomake an a priori judgment and decide that the question is not worthinvestigating because keys cannot be bent by merely stroking them. If he ishonest, then he must at least be willing to be prepared to study the matter moreclosely.Most scientists would reply that this is precisely how they operate, and inprinciple this is perfectly true. In fact, they are human beings, and aresubject to boredom, impatience and touchiness like the rest of us, which meansthat they can easily drift over the borderline that separates scientificdetachment from emotional commitment.One of CSICOP’s less dogmatic members was the mathematician Martin Gardner,whose book Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science is an amusing anddelightful study in “cults of unreason”. We can read of the prophet Voliva, whobelieved that the earth is flat, of Captain Symmes, who believed it is hollow,of Cyrus Teed, who believed it is shaped like an egg and that we are living onits inner surface. Gardner is wickedly amusing on the Jehovah’s Witnesses andthe cranks who believe that the Great Pyramid contains information about thesecond coming of Christ. But after half-a-dozen chapters the reader begins tofind this attitude of constant superiority rather cloying. Is the author somekind of super-intellect who has discovered the secret of eternal truth? Is hequite sure that dowsing for water is a laughable superstition, that everyone whohas seen a UFO is deluded or mistaken, that the continent of Atlantis was afigment of Plato’s imagination, that Wilhelm Reich’s later ideas were purelunacy? It is surely a question of where one decides to draw the line. I aminclined to agree that Immanuel Velikovsky was, in the last analysis, a crank –that is, that his theories about the connection between Venus and Biblicalcatastrophes are the result of inspiration rather than careful scientificreasoning. But many of his inspired guesses were amazingly accurate – forexample, his belief that earth is surrounded by powerful magnetic fields. Andthere are influential philosophers of science like Sir Karl Popper, MichaelPolanyi and Abraham Maslow who believed that all scientific thinking is based on“inspiration” rather than on careful scientific reasoning. In short Gardnerseems to me to be drawing his line in the wrong place.I have written a biography of Wilhelm Reich, and I agree that Reich was dogmaticand paranoid, as well as being a thoroughly disagreeable character. But then,the trouble with Reich was that he had, like so many other psychoanalysts,borrowed from Freud a mantle of papal infallibility. All neurosis is sexual inorigin, and a neurotic person is incapable of facing up to the sexual nature ofhis problems. You disagree? It only proves that you have sexual problems thatyou are afraid to acknowledge. In this respect Reich is like Dr Johnson; if hispistol misfires he will knock you down with the butt. Anyone who disagrees withhim must be “mentally sick”. But Gardner’s own book is full of this same tone ofbrutal dogmatism. There is an underlying assumption that he is infallible. Andwhile the reader is willing to entertain this as a possibility, he would like toknow more of the methods by which Gardner arrives at his unshakeablecertainties.In fact, it would be disastrous if Gardner’s attitude became widely accepted andpart of the “conventional wisdom”. The progress of human knowledge depends onmaintaining that touch of scepticism even about the most “unquestionable”truths. A century ago, Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection wasregarded as scientifically unshakeable; today, most biologists have theirreservations about it. Fifty years ago, Freud’s sexual theory of neurosis wasaccepted by most psychiatrists; today, it is widely recognized that his methodswere highly questionable. At the turn of this century, a scientist whoquestioned Newton’s theory of gravity would have been regarded as insane; twentyyears later, it had been supplanted by Einstein’s theory although,significantly, few people actually understood it. It seems perfectly conceivablethat our descendants of the twenty-second century will wonder how any of uscould have been stupid enough to be taken in by Darwin, Freud or Einstein.Gardner devotes a chapter to attacking the ideas of Charles Fort, the New Yorkerwho spent his life insisting that scientists are too dogmatic, and ought to bemore willing to question their basic assumptions. He objects that, since Fort ismerely a destructive critic, with no theories of his own to offer, he isbasically barren. There is an element of truth in this. But Gardner fails tograsp that what Fort is really objecting to is the rigid, commissar-likeattitude that characterizes his own book. Fort is arguing that scientificdiscovery has its roots in a sense of wonder, and that a sense of wonder, evenwith a touch of gullibility, is preferable to a kind of humourless Marxiandogmatism. Newton himself was fascinated by alchemy, and regarded his greatestwork as his commentary on the Book of Daniel. Does this qualify Newton as acrank? Obviously not. The inference is surely that it is more fruitful to beintrigued by the possibility of some prehistoric monster in the depths of LochNess than to dismiss it as a childish absurdity. It is more fruitful to concedethat UFOs may be real than to dismiss them as hallucinations. It may even bemore fruitful to admit that the evidence suggests that Shakespeare may not havewritten his own plays, or that Andrew Crosse created life in his labouratory, orthat Orffyreus may have discovered the secret of perpetual motion, than to takethe attitude that such extravagances are not even worth discussing.The career of another “sceptical” friend, Ian Wilson, has also provided me witha great deal of wry amusement. A Roman Catholic convert, he began by writing animportant book that argued that the “Holy Shroud of Turin” is genuine. Hefollowed this with a book about reincarnation entitled Mind Out of Time, whichbrilliantly attacked a number of cases of alleged “memories of past lives”, likethe famous Bridey Murphy case. (The Catholic Church has officially condemned thenotion of reincarnation.) He was then asked to participate in a televisionseries based on the files of the Society for Psychical Research, and although hewas again able to use his debunking technique to considerable effect in caseslike that of the “Croglin vampire”, he had to admit that in other cases,particularly those involving ghosts, the evidence simply could not be dismissed.When Wilson turned his attention to “the after-death experience” (in a book ofthat title), the same thing happened, and even after dismissing much of theevidence as fraudulent, he ended by acknowledging that the overall case for“survival” was very powerful indeed. A more recent book of Wilson’s, Superselfconcerns unusual powers of the mind, including dowsing and healing, and ends byacknowledging the reality of what might be called the “superconscious mind”.Here we have an example of a man who has the patience and honesty to study manycases of apparently paranormal powers in some detail and who ends with hisscepticism deeply eroded – although he finds himself too embarrassed to come outopenly and admit that he has, in effect, made a 180 degree turn.Another interesting example of the “wholesale” attitude toward paranormalphenomena can be found in a book entitled Secrets of the Supernatural by JoeNickell and John Fischer. The authors’ aim is to solve a number of mysteriesthrough the investigative approach. The first chapter describes an investigationinto a haunting at Mackenzie House, in Toronto. They cite various witnesses, whoclaim to have seen ghosts over the years and some who have heard spooky noisesat night. They then describe how they spoke to the caretaker of the house nextdoor, who demonstrated that various noises made in the basement were“telegraphed” to the “haunted house”.The authors leave us in no doubt that many of the “spooky” noises in MackenzieHouse were the result of a rumbling boiler. But this fails to explain the ghostsightings of the witnesses. The tacit assumption is that the demonstration aboutthe noises allows us to dismiss actual sightings. In fact, it may or it may not.If you happen to believe, as I do, that there are such things as ghosts, thenyou would require a further demonstration that the sightings of a shadowy womanand a man in a frock coat were also the result of the rumbling boiler.Sceptical investigators all seem to make this same curious logical error.William James pointed out that if you want to disprove that all crows are black,you do not have to try and prove that no crows are black; you only have toproduce one single white crow. So a bookful of cases of fraud or excessivegullibility proves nothing except that those particular cases are fraudulent.But one single case of a paranormal event for which the evidence is overwhelmingdoes demolish the argument that the paranormal is, by definition, fraudulent.The truth is that the expansion of human knowledge depends on asking questions.A cow learns nothing because it cannot ask questions; the cow’s world is exactlywhat it looks like, nothing more and nothing less, and there is nothing to askquestions about. But when Thales saw an eclipse he wanted to know what causedit. Newton asked the apparently absurd question: why does an apple fall to theground instead of staying where it is? And Einstein asked the ultimately absurdquestion: what would it be like to sit astride a beam of light? All thesequestions led to fruitful results. If Martin Gardner had been standing behindthem with folded arms, they would probably have decided to keep quiet.Consider a question raised by the zoologist Ivan Sanderson. On a moonlit night,on a dust-covered road in Haiti, he and his wife both experienced a curioushallucination of being back in Paris in the fifteenth century. (The story istold in full in “Time in Disarray” in this volume.) Gardner would declare thatthis is a question that should simply not be asked unless the answer is thatSanderson was either drunk or lying. But it is obvious that he was neither.Those who knew him (and I have a letter on my desk from one of them at themoment) agree that he was an honest man who was not remotely interested in the“supernatural”. It is also worth asking how Sanderson’s servants knew he hadbeen involved in an accident – although it occurred in a remote and desertedspot – and that he would be home at dawn.And so is another question that Sanderson’s experience leads him to discuss:whether the mind is identical with the brain. He mentions a case of a man whodied in a New York hospital, and who an autopsy revealed to have no brain, only“half a cupful of dirty water”. This sounds, admittedly, like another of thoseabsurd stories that are not worth discussing. But in the early 1980s ProfessorJohn Lourber of Sheffield University discovered a student with an IQ of 126whose head was entirely filled with “water”. A brain scan showed that thestudent’s brain was merely an outer layer, only one millimetre thick. How can aperson function with virtually no brain? Lourber, who specializes inhydrocephalis (“water on the brain”) replies that he has come across many casesof perfectly normal people whose heads are filled with 95 per cent of fluid, andthat 70 to 90 per cent is actually quite common.If a person can think without using the brain, the obvious conclusion would seemto be that the being who does the thinking exists apart from his brain.The real problem posed by experiences such as that of the Sandersons is oneconcerning the nature of time. All scientific reasoning, even the leastdogmatic, tells us that it is totally impossible to slip back into the past orforetell the future. Where the past is concerned, we can admittedly speculatethat the “time slip” is some kind of “tape recording”. But a vision of thefuture should be a total impossibility, since the future has not yet happened.In spite of which, there are many well authenticated cases of “glimpses” intothe future. (I once presented a television programme about one of these – anIrish peer named Lord Kilbracken who dreamed repeatedly about the winners ofhorse races, and won money by backing them.) It seems to follow that there issomething fundamentally wrong with the vision of the world presented to us byour senses – in fact, we have only to think for a moment to see that there mustbe something wrong with a logic that tells us that everything has a beginningand an end, and then presents us with the paradox of a universe that apparentlyhas neither.This is why the views of CSICOP should be treated with suspicion. It is notsimply a question of whether ESP or telepathy deserve to be taken seriously, butwhether – as Martin Gardner would like to believe – the universe is ultimatelyas rational and “normal” as a novel by Jane Austen or Anthony Trollope. This isan easy belief to maintain, because the universe that confronts us when we openour eyes in the morning looks perfectly “normal”, and it is unlikely that weshall encounter any event during the day that contradicts this assumption. Butthen the universe looks “unquestionable” to a cow for the same kind of reason.We know that the moment we begin to use our intelligence to ask questions, theuniverse becomes a far more strange and mysterious place. Most scientists would,in fact, agree wholeheartedly with this sentiment, for science begins with asense of mystery. But a certain type of scientist – and they are, unfortunately,in the majority – would also like to believe that the mysteries can all besolved by the kind of simple deductive logic employed by Sherlock Holmes. Andthe problems presented by “time slips” or precognitions or synchronicities, orby poltergeists and out-of-the-body experiences, make it clear that this iswishful thinking. We can only keep science within comfortable logical boundariesby refusing to acknowledge the existence of anything that lies outside thoseboundaries.It may seem reasonable to ask: Where is the harm in that? No one blames apoliceman for not being interested in mysticism or philosophy – that is not hisjob. Why blame a physicist for taking no interest in poltergeists and ESP?The answer is that his preconceptions about the universe also involvepreconceptions about the human mind. In the nineteenth century it made nodifference whatever whether a scientist was interested in psychical research orregarded it as a delusion. But by the second half of the twentieth century,science was speculating whether the universe might contain eleven dimensions andwhether black holes might be an entrance into a dimensionless “hyperspace” –even whether we might be able to use black holes to travel across the universe.Russian and American scientists have been experimenting with ESP as a means ofcommunicating with submarines under the polar ice. Suddenly the question of thelimits of the human mind has become a question of major scientific importance.If we are merely chance products of a material universe, then our position isbasically that of spectators, and the extent to which we can “intervene” islimited. But if – to take just one example – Sanderson’s vision of fifteenthcentury Paris was not a hallucination, but was some kind of glimpse of a hiddenpower of his own mind, then it would challenge the whole Darwinian picture ofevolution.Consider the strange case of the calculating twins discussed in the article onidentical twins. A prime number is a number that cannot be divided exactly byany other number, like 3, 7 and 13. But there is no easy, quick way to tellwhether a number is a prime or not: you just have to patiently divide all thesmaller numbers into it and see if any of them “goes” precisely. If a number isvery large – say five figures – then the only quick way to find out if it isprime is to look it up in a table of prime numbers. Yet these twins can do itinstantaneously, and that is absurd. Quite apart from the mystery of how theycan do it, there is the even more baffling mystery of how such a power couldhave developed during the course of human history. According to Darwin, thebasic mechanism of evolution is “survival of the fittest”. The cheetah can runfaster than a man and the kangaroo jump higher because they had to in order tosurvive. Most animals cannot count beyond a few figures. Man had to learn tocount as his social life became more complex. Even so, most people are “bad atfigures”. So how could any human being have developed this amazing ability torecognize five figure primes instantaneously, when even a computer would beunable to do it?There can only be one answer: that we are wrong to think that human intelligencehas to operate like a computer. It seems to have some “alternative method”. Andpresumably it was the same alternative method that accidentally allowedSanderson his curious glimpse of the past. That statement sounds reasonableenough, for we all agree that “intuition” seems to operate in mysterious ways.But then we come upon a case in which someone has clearly foreseen the future,and we know this is not simply a question of intuition. The notion that time hasa one-way flow is the very foundation of western science; everything depends onit. If precognition is possible, then our basic assumptions need revising.For the scientists of the nineteenth century, such an idea was deeplydisquieting; that is why so many of them were so hostile to “psychicalresearch”. It seemed the opposite of what all science stood for; a return tosuperstitions and old wives’ tales instead of experiment and analysis. In 1848this reaction of science had swung so far that a novelist named Catherine Crowedecided it was time to protest. So she went to a great deal of trouble to gathertogether some of the best authenticated cases of the “supernatural” she couldfind – the kind of cases that would later be carefully examined by the Societyfor Psychical Research – and published them in a book called The Night Side ofNature. It had a considerable impact on thoughtful people.But Mrs Crowe was unfortunate. The year of its publication also happened to bethe year when strange poltergeist disturbances took place in the home of the Foxfamily in New York State – curious rappings and bangings that occurred in thepresence of the two children, Kate and Margaret. In a code of raps, the “entity”claimed to be a murdered peddler who had been buried in the basement. (In fact,a human skeleton was found buried in the basement in 1907.) These manifestationscaused a sensation, and soon “Spiritualism” had begun to spread across Americaand Europe. Scientists were outraged at this fashionable tide of “superstition”– particularly when a number of “mediums” proved to be frauds – and Mrs Crowe’shighly reasonable arguments were forgotten. In fact she encountered so muchhostility that a little over a decade after the publication of The Night Side ofNature she had a nervous breakdown and spent some time in a mental home; duringthe last sixteen years of her life, she wrote no more.Now, more than a century and a half later, Spiritualism has ceased to be achallenge to science, and has become little more than a harmless minorityreligion; nowadays it is perfectly obvious that it never was a challenge toscience. We can also see that there was never any question of science beingsupplanted by superstition and old wives’ tales, and that therefore CSICOP wasquite wrong to imagine that the success of Uri Geller heralded a return to theMiddle Ages.What it would involve is a recognition that the history of life on earth may bea little more complex than Darwin thought. If paranormal powers, such astelepathy and “second sight”, actually exist, then it also seems fairly certainthat they were possessed in a far greater degree by our primitive ancestors,just as they are now possessed in a greater degree by many “primitive” people.Sanderson makes it clear, for example, that he believes that some of theHaitians he encountered possessed powers of “second sight”. One of theseremarked to him after his “timeslip” experience, “You saw things, didn’t you?You don’t believe it, but you could always see things if you wanted to”. Inshort, Sanderson himself could have developed or perhaps simply rediscovered hisparanormal faculties.In my book The Occult I have cited many cases that seem to illustrate the samepoint. For example, the famous tiger-hunter Jim Corbett describes in Man Eatersof Kumaon how he came to develop what he calls “jungle sensitiveness”, so heknew when a wild animal was lying in wait for him. Obviously, such a facultywould be very useful to a tiger hunter in India, but virtually useless to astockbroker in New York. So it would seem that civilized man has deliberatelygot rid of it. Or rather, the development of another faculty – the ability todeal with the complications of civilized life – has suppressed the “paranormal”faculty, because we no longer need it.But is this actually true? Is it even true that a New York stockbroker does notneed “jungle sensitiveness”. After all, he lives in other kinds of jungle – notonly the commercial jungle, but the concrete jungle where muggers lurk inpedestrian subways and public parks. His real problem is more likely to be theproblem that caused Catherine Crowe’s nervous breakdown; that he has allowedcivilized life to “get on top of him”. We have all, to some extent, lost thatprimitive vital force that can be found in most “savage” peoples. But what hasreally been lost is a certain sense of wonder, a certain basic optimism. Thechild thinks that this world of adults is a magical place, full of endlessadventures: going into bars, driving motorcars, catching aeroplanes . . . Hewould find it very hard to believe that as he grows up the world will turn intoa hard and ruthless and rather nasty place, where the basic rule is, “Nobodygets anything for nothing”.The adult’s problem is that his attitudes have become negative. I have describedelsewhere how in 1967 I went to lecture at a university in Los Angeles, thenwent to meet my family in Disneyland. I had forgotten just how big Disneylandis, and when I walked in through the turnstile and saw the crowds my heart sank.But I was feeling cheerful and optimistic, having just given a good lecture. SoI relaxed, placed myself in a mood of confidence and then simply allowed my feetto take me to them. I strolled at random for about fifty yards, turned left, andfound them standing at a Mexican food stall.Forty-eight hours ago I was looking for a book on the Habsburg Empire, and Isearched through three book cases without success. The next morning I madeanother search, and this time found the book on a shelf I had searched severaltimes. Why had I missed it? Because I was in a state of tension as I searched(as if I was in a hurry) and sheer “haste” made me look at it without seeing it.Conversely, I have noticed again and again that when I am in a mood of relaxedconfidence I can find things by some kind of “sixth sense”.But I have noticed something even more interesting: that when I am in thesemoods of relaxed confidence, things just somehow seem to “go right”. And thisobviously has nothing to do with me or with any “sixth sense”. I just happen to“stumble upon” an important piece of information the day before I am due towrite about it, or avoid some unpleasant experience by sheer serendipity.Our basic civilized problem is that our attitudes have become quiteunjustifiably negative. Everyone is familiar with the experience of how reliefcan place us in an optimistic frame of mind. The plumbing goes wrong and youhave to flush the lavatory with buckets of water for a couple of days. When theplumber finally arrives you feel immense relief, and for the next twenty-fourhours feel how delightful it is to have a lavatory that flushes at the touch ofa button. And whenever we experience this relief we also recognize that we aresurrounded by reasons for delight: with bath taps and light switches andelectric toasters that actually work, and doors that open without squeaking, andtelevisions that provide us with news as often as we want it. It has taken manabout fifty thousand years to move out of caves and achieve this felicity. Yetwe have become so accustomed to our civilization that we take it for granted,and spend most of our time worrying about trivialities.Yet whenever some minor inconvenience is followed by relief, we recognize thatwe have allowed ourselves to discount our blessings, and fall into a narrow andjoyless state of mind. Civilization was designed to give us leisure and freedom;instead, we waste our days concentrating obsessively on minor problems that willappear totally unimportant in a week’s time. And this anxiety-riddenshortsightedness is due to certain left-brain qualities that we have developedover the past few thousand years. (The left-brain deals with logic and language,the right with meaning and intuition.) The only way to regain our birthright ofleisure and freedom is to recognize that everyday left-brain awareness somehowtells us lies, and that we have to learn to relax into a wider type ofawareness.Consider the following example from a book called The States of HumanConsciousnes by C. Daly King; he is speaking of experiences of what he calls“Awakeness”.> The first of them took place upon the platform of a commuters’ railway station> in New Jersey as the writer walked along it to take a coming train to New York> late one sunny morning. On the platform there were several small housings for> freight elevators, news-stands and so on, constructed of dun-coloured bricks.> He was emotionally at ease, planning unhurriedly the schedule of his various> calls in the city and simultaneously attempting to be aware, actively and> impartially, of the movements of his body’s walking . . .> > Suddenly the entire aspects of his surroundings changed. The whole atmosphere> seemed strangely vitalized and abruptly the few other persons on the platform> took on an appearance hardly more important or significant than that of the> door-knobs at the entrance of the passengers’ waiting room. But the most> extraordinary alteration was that of the dun-coloured bricks, for there was no> concomitant sensory illusion in the experience. But all at once they appeared> to be tremendously alive; without manifesting any exterior motion they seemed> to be seething almost joyously inside and gave the distinct impression that in> their own degree they were living actively and liking it. This impression so> struck the writer that he remained staring at them for some minutes, until the> train arrived . . .> > The first thing to note about this is his comment that “he was emotionally atease, planning unhurriedly the schedule of his various calls”. That is, he wasin a “right-brain” state, free of tension. Then some curious effort, some slightmovement of the mind, so to speak, propelled him in the right direction, andmade him aware that the bricks he would normally have taken for granted weresomehow glowing with inner life. It is also significant that the human beingswho would normally have occupied the centre of his field of attention now ceasedto seem important. Long habit has made us select human beings as the centre ofour field of attention, for we are social animals whose peace of mind dependsupon “fitting into” society.There is no need to assume that his perception of the bricks was a “mystical”experience. We can all induce something of the sort by simply staring intentlyat a perfectly ordinary wall in the sunlight. Our problem is that we do notnormally concentrate on anything; we “scan” things automatically, like the girlon a supermarket checkout. But if anything attracts our interest and we focusour full attention on it, we instantly experience this sense of heightenedmeaning.I am only trying to point out that the chief reason our experience usually seemsto unmemorable is that we have become accustomed to responding “robotically” toour surroundings, leaving the automatic pilot to do the driving for us.And what difference would non-robotic experience make? Basically this: it wouldmake Daly King aware that the normal assumption he shares with the rest of us,that the world “out there” is a rather ordinary place, is mistaken. His sensesare telling him lies. Or rather, his senses are doing their best; it is hisattitudes, his assumptions, that reduce their testimony to “ordinariness”. His“glimpse” would have told him that he is surrounded by an unutterably strangevicious circle in which most of us are trapped. This consists in the assumptionthat the world out there is rather ordinary and dull. And when we are bored ourenergies sink. And when our energies sink it is rather like a cloud coming overthe sun, making the world seem dimmer and less interesting. This feeling thatthe world is uninteresting prevents us from making any kind of effort. Thenormal human tendency – unaided by external stimulus – is to sink into a stateof lethargy, rather like Samuel Beckett characters sitting in dustbins.Every glimpse of reality – every “moment of vision” – even setting out onholiday – tells us the opposite. This tells us that when a cloud seems toobscure the sun, what has actually happened is that we have allowed our sensesto become dimmer, like the device in a cinema that lowers the lights. Perceptionis “intentional”. You see things by a beam of light generated by a dynamo insideyour head. When you are bored the dynamo works at half speed, and everything youlook at seems dull. But if you can persuade your subconscious mind that theworld out there is fascinating – as holidays persuade it – the dynamo willaccelerate, and you will see that this is true.Wordsworth talked about the time of childhood, when everything seem “apparelledin celestial light”. This is because the child knows that there is an infinitelymarvellous world out there, and automatically makes that effort that keeps thedynamo working at top speed. Human beings begin to die when they become trappedin the “vicious circle”, and become convinced they have “seen it all”. Andunless circumstances force them to continue to make an effort they sink gentlyinto a kind of swamp of boredom, of “taken-for-grantedness”, that finallyengulfs them. (This is why so many people die after they retire from a lifetimeof work.)Now, obviously, the human race is on the point of an extremely interestingevolutionary development. The first step towards escape from this vicious circleis to recognize that the apparent “ordinariness” of the world is a delusion. Ifwe could become deeply and permanently convinced that the world “out there” isendlessly exciting, we would never again allow ourselves to become trapped inthe swamp of “taken-for-grantedness”. And we would become practicallyunkillable. Shaw says of his “Ancients” in Back to Methuselah: “Even in themoment of death, their life does not fail them”. “Life failure” is that feelingthat there is nothing new under the sun, and that we all have to accept defeatin the end. If we could learn the mental trick of causing the dynamo toaccelerate, this illusion would never again be able to exert its power over us.Let me state my own fundamental belief about human existence. Man consists of ahighly complex body, a “computer” that has taken millions of years to evolve,controlled by an entity which we call the soul, spirit or whatever. But to placethe “spirit” in charge of such a complicated piece of machinery is like asking ababy to drive a Rolls-Royce. We fail to understand about 90 per cent of itspotentialities. Besides, it is simply too “heavy” for us to handle comfortably.As we drag this massively heavy body around, we are in the position of aspace-traveller who has been cast away on a planet where gravity is severaltimes greater than on earth, so he cannot even stand upright, and it takes himall his strength just to crawl on his hands and knees. When he is galvanized bysome emergency he can summon far more strength, and even stagger briefly on tohis feet. Then he can catch a glimpse of the real answer: that he has to developfar more powerful muscles – mental as well as physical muscles.Whenever I am faced by some exciting challenge or crisis I can see the answer. Ican then see that if I could be “galvanized” like this all the time, I couldrise up to a far higher level of purpose and vitality. Our trouble is that aftera crisis we quickly lose that sense of emergency, and sink back into the olddull, sleepy state in which every molehill becomes a mountain, and the mindfalls into a curious apathy in which it loses all sense of purpose. In fact weare so accustomed to this state that we accept it as normal. We only tend toglimpse our true potentialities when we set out on voyages – either physical ormental.The answer lies in generating (through the use of determination) a far morepowerful imagination, a sense of reality, that will make us continually aware ofthe potential challenges and problems, and keep us in the “galvanized” state. Itis a total absurdity that a man sitting on a train should stare dully out of thewindow, when his mind contains a vast library of past experiences that couldkeep him entertained for years.All this explains, of course, why we spend so much of our time seeking outchallenges and stimulants – travel, adventure, sport, sex, alcohol; it is apathetic and misguided attempt to hurl ourselves beyond these stupidlimitations. If we could learn to identify and face the basic problem, we wouldhave taken the most decisive step towards solving it. We would become incapableof boredom, and “discouragement” would lose its power over us. We would begin tosee the way out of the trap that has been killing off human beings prematurelyfor thousands of generations.Now it should be clear why I feel such impatience with those people who want toconvince us that the universe is a perfectly rational and logical place, andthat any attempt to suggest the opposite is a return to medieval superstition. Iam prepared to admit that poltergeists are not particularly important – thescientist’s instinct is perfectly sound on that point – and neither are “timeslips” or precognitions or out-of-the-body experiences; I myself feel thatpeople who are too obsessed with the paranormal are as boring as people who aretoo obsessed with football or television soap operas. But these experiences areonly a small part of the vast panorama of strangeness that will confront us whenwe learn that mental trick of slipping out of the bonds of habit, and making apowerful and continuous effort to tear aside the “curtains of everydayness” thatsurround us.If this book needs any justification, it is that it is a modest attempt to catcha few glimpses of the strangeness that lies on the other side of the curtain."},{"pageContent":"1 King Arthur and MerlinLegend or Reality?King Arthur and his magician, Merlin, are two of the most popular figures inworld mythology. But did either of them really exist? Or are they merelycharacters in a charming fairy tale?We can understand, of course, why historians would cast doubt on the existenceof Merlin. But some modern scholars have even doubted that King Arthur was areal historical character. This is obviously a question that must be settledbefore we go any further.We first hear about Arthur and Merlin in a book entitled History of the Kings ofBritain, written around 1135 by a Welsh bishop named Geoffrey of Monmouth –whose reliableness may be judged by his opening chapter, in which he explainshow Britain was named after the warrior Brutus, who sailed there from the siegeof Troy. A hundred or so pages later, Geoffrey describes how a king namedVortigern – who was a real historical character – ordered an impregnable towerto be built on Mount Snowdon, in Wales. The tower kept collapsing, whereuponsome soothsayers told him that if he wanted the tower to remain standing, hewould have to sprinkle the stones with the blood of a boy who had no father. Hismessengers traveled throughout the kingdom in search of such a youth, until theyoverheard two boys quarreling and one of them jeering that the other had nofather. The fatherless boy was named Merlin.King Vortigern sent for Merlin and his mother, who proved to be the daughter ofthe king of South Wales. She described how she had been seduced by a handsomeyouth who subsequently vanished into thin air – although she sometimes heard hisvoice speaking to her when she was alone. Vortigern then explained that sinceMerlin was literally fatherless, he had to sacrifice him and sprinkle his bloodon the foundations of the tower. Merlin promptly offered to prove that thesoothsayers were liars and asked to have them brought before him. “Do you knowwhy the tower keeps on collapsing”? he asked them. They shook their heads.“Because there is a pool underneath it which makes the earth soggy”. Vortigern’smen were ordered to dig and found the pool. Merlin then went on to foretell thatif they drained it they would find two dragons (or serpents). And when this alsoproved to be true, Vortigern decided to spare his life. Merlin then went on tomake a series of prophecies – including the augury that Vortigern would beburned to death in a tower. This came about just as Merlin foretold, when a kingnamed Aurelius Ambrosius – the rightful heir to the throne – invaded Britain andset fire to Vortigern’s tower.When Aurelius was poisoned his brother, Uther Pendragon, became king. Afterconquering Scotland, he invited all the nobles of his realm to a feast towitness his coronation. Among these were Duke Gorlois of Cornwall and hisbeautiful wife, Igerna. Uther fell madly in love with Igerna, and when Gorloisrealized this he hurried back to Cornwall. This insulted the King, who pursuedGorlois with an army. Gorlois forestalled the rape of his wife by hiding heraway in the castle of Tintagel, which was virtually impregnable, for it stood onan island that was approached only by a narrow neck of land. When he learnedabout this, Uther Pendragon fell into a deep depression, for he could thinkabout nothing but possessing Igerna.The problem was solved by Merlin, who used his magic to transform Uther intoDuke Gorlois’s double. Uther went to the castle of Tintagel and was immediatelyadmitted. That night, in Igerna’s arms, he conceived the boy who would becomeKing Arthur.While Uther was away his men attacked the castle in which Gorlois had takenrefuge. Gorlois was killed, and Uther Pendragon married Igerna and made herqueen. He reigned for another fifteen years until he was also poisoned, and thenArthur became king.Readers of Geoffrey of Monmouth (whose book is still in print in a popularedition) will wonder what happened to the sword in the stone, the Knights of theRound Table, and other famous parts of the legend. The answer is that they wereadded by later (mostly French) chroniclers and given their definitive form inone of the first printed books, Sir Thomas Malory’s Morte D’Arthur, printed byWilliam Caxton in 1485. Little was known about its author until 1926, whenliterary research revealed – to the dismay of scholars – that Malory was arobber chief who sacked monasteries and rustled cattle, and who raped a womannamed Joan Smyth, the wife of one Hugh Smyth, on at least two occasions. Heapparently wrote Morte D’Arthur in Newgate Prison, where he is buried.But if Arthur was a teenager when his father died, why should he have had toprove his right to the throne by pulling a sword out of a stone (or an anvil setin a stone, as Malory tells the story)? Malory overcomes this problem by havingMerlin take charge of Arthur from the moment he is born; Merlin then hands thebaby over to a knight named Sir Ector, whose wife suckles Arthur.It all sounds so absurd that it is not surprising that some scholars havedismissed Arthur as a legend. They point out, for example, that one of the mainsources of information on Arthur’s period is a monk named St. Gildas who wrote abitter and disgruntled book entitled. The Downfall and Conquest of Great Britain(De excidio et conquestu Britanniae) and who does not even mention Arthur –although he speaks of the Battle of Badon, which is Arthur’s most famous battle.But a biography of Gildas by Caradoc of Llancarfan mentions that Arthur killedGildas’s brother, Hueil, who fought against him; that in itself would obviouslyexplain why Gildas could not even bring himself to mention Arthur’s name.So what do we actually know about the legendary hero called King Arthur? Well,to begin with, he was not a king but a general. He did not ride around on awhite charger dressed in a suit of medieval armor, because he belonged to a farearlier period – he was probably born about AD 470, during the period when theRomans had just left Britain. He was, in fact, a Roman – or at least a Romancitizen. So his horse would have been a small Roman horse, about the size of amodern pony, and his sword would have been a short Roman sword, not a longbroadsword like the legendary Excalibur.Around AD 410 the Romans decided to pull out of Britain – they needed all theirforces to defend Rome from the barbarians. A chieftain named Vortigern sethimself up as king of Britain but soon encountered trouble with the wild Pictsfrom north of the Scottish border; around AD 443 he invited Saxon mercenariesfrom the Continent to come and fight for him. They did, but when Vortigern ranout of money to pay them, they decided to stay and conquer Britain. The originalBritons – whom we now call Celts – were slowly driven west into Wales, Cornwall,and Scotland. However, an ex-Roman warrior named Ambrosius Aurelianus ralliedthe Celts and went to war with Roman thoroughness, inflicting many defeats onthe invaders. When he died, his brother, Uther Pendragon, replaced him. And oneof his most brilliant generals was a young man named Artorius, the legendaryKing Arthur – who may or may not have been the son of Uther Pendragon.It was Arthur who brought the Saxon invasion to a standstill in a series oftwelve great battles, the last of which, the Battle of Badon, took place aboutAD 518. This established him as the Dark Age equivalent of General Montgomery orGeneral Eisenhower. If his allies had remained loyal, it seems probable that theSaxons would have been driven back to the Continent, and it would now beArthur’s Celtic descendants who rule Britain, not the Anglo-Saxons.Unfortunately, Arthur’s former allies now fell to squabbling among themselves,and Arthur spent the remainder of his life trying to avoid being stabbed in theback. When he finally died, in the Battle of Camlann – which, according toGeoffrey, took place near the River Camel in Cornwall – he was fighting his ownnephew Mordred, not the Saxon invaders. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth,Arthur’s body was carried off to the “Isle of Avalon”, which has been identifiedas Glastonbury, a small town in the west of England with a famous abbey and ator – a hill surmounted by a tower. (Although Glastonbury is now inland, therewas a time when it was surrounded by the waters of the Bristol Channel.) Becausethe burial was secret, to prevent the Saxons from finding the body, a widespreadstory soon arose that Arthur was not really dead but would return to helpBritain in her hour of need.In the summer of 1113, about twenty years before Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote hisHistory, a group of French priests came to Bodmin, in Cornwall, carrying holyrelics. When one of the locals mentioned that Arthur was still alive and wasexpected to return any day, the servant of one of the clerics was tactlessenough to sneer. This caused a violent confrontation, and a group of armedCornishmen burst into the church with the intention of teaching the skepticalforeigners a lesson; it was only with some difficulty that they were pacified.This seems to demonstrate that Arthur was already a legendary figure beforeGeoffrey of Monmouth wrote his bestseller.In fact, Arthur is mentioned many times in various Welsh poems written within acentury of his death. But the next major reference to him comes in a confusedcollection of historical material compiled by a monk named Nennius some timebetween AD 800 and 820. The earliest material about Arthur that Nennius quotesis a collection of Welsh “Easter Annals”, tables of the dates of Easter (whichis a movable feast) compiled by monks. These tables have wide margins, and inone of these – for the year AD 518 – there is a jotting (in Latin): “Battle ofBadon in which Arthur carried the cross of Our Lord Jesus on his shoulders forthree days and three nights and the Britons were victors”. And another, for theyear AD 539 reads: “The strife of Camlann in which Arthur and Modred [sic]perished”. So if we can believe the Easter Annals, Arthur ruled for twenty-oneyears after the Battle of Badon.But the most dramatic incident in the story of Arthur occurred about thirtyyears after the death of Geoffrey of Monmouth (in AD 1154), during the reign ofHenry II – the king who is best remembered in connection with the murder ofArchbishop Thomas à Becket. Henry was an indefatigable traveler, and on one ofhis trips to Wales he met a Welsh bard, a “singer of the past”, who told himthat King Arthur was buried in the grounds of Glastonbury Abbey. To protect thebody from the Saxons, said the bard, it had been buried sixteen feet deep. Heeven mentioned the exact location – between two “pyramids”.The king was naturally delighted, for Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History hadrepresented Arthur as one of the greatest conquerors since Julius Caesar.(According to Geoffrey, Arthur had conquered Ireland, Scandinavia, and Franceand was about to march on Rome when news of Mordred’s rebellion forced him toreturn to England.) He was also relieved to hear that Arthur was buried inGlastonbury. As the great-grandson of William the Conqueror, he was familiarwith the legend that Arthur would return in England’s hour of need. If he couldprove that Arthur was well and truly dead, the latter would cease to be arallying cry for rebels like the men of Bodmin.Besides, Henry had an affection for Glastonbury, because the abbot Henry ofBlois had played a part in making him king. So Henry went to call on the abbotto tell him the good news.Oddly enough, the abbot was not as pleased as he might have been. GlastonburyAbbey was already one of the richest in England; it didn’t need any more fame toattract pilgrims. And “between two pyramids” might mean anything.Then the situation changed dramatically. On 25 May 1184, the abbey caught fireand was left in ruins. The encouraging thing about it was that the image of OurLady of Glastonbury had survived undamaged, which suggested that God still hadgreat things in store for the abbey. Henry II produced funds to startrebuilding; many nobles contributed. And in 1191 one of the monks died afterexpressing a wish to be buried on the grounds, between two crosses. These stoodon two marble pillars that tapered toward the top and might have been describedas tall pyramids. For some reason – perhaps because they remembered the words ofthe Welsh bard – the monks went on digging below six feet and at seven feetencountered a stone slab. They prized it up. On its underside was a leadencross, with a Latin inscription that read: Hic jacet sepultus inclytus RexArtorius in insula Avalonia (“Here lies buried the renowned King Arthur in theIsle of Avalon”).They went on digging – it probably took days to make a hole sixteen feet deepand wide enough to allow several diggers to operate. But at sixteen feet, justas the old bard had foretold, the mattocks struck wood. An enormous coffin,hollowed out of oak, was unearthed. Inside, they found the huge skeleton of aman, whose skull had been smashed by heavy blows. A monk saw a lock of yellowhair and leaned over to grab it. It dissolved in his fingers, and the monk fellinto the coffin. Later, they identified fragments of a smaller skeleton andrealized that the hair was that of Arthur’s wife, Guinevere. One chronicler,Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales), who actually saw the bones and the crossin the following year, says the inscription on the cross also mentioned “QueenWenneverla” (Guinevere).From that moment on, the abbey became the most popular tourist site in England,if not in Europe. The abbey was soon rebuilt on a magnificent scale.Scholars have accused the monks of Glastonbury of inventing the whole story, yetthis seems unlikely. Giraldus Cambrensis seems to have been an honest man – hewas one of the few to denounce Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History as a pack of lies– and he specifically claims to have seen both skeletons and the leaden cross.This cross was still around for many centuries, and in 1607 an antiquarian namedWilliam Camden published a picture of it. His text spells Arthur Arturius, anancient form that was in use in the time of King Arthur but had not been usedsince. (Even the Easter Annals spell his name Arthur.)Moreover, a re-excavation of the site in 1963 by C. A. Radford showed that themonks were telling the truth about digging down sixteen feet. Besides, as theArthurian scholar Geoffrey Ashe has pointed out, Glastonbury is also supposed tobe the burial site of Joseph of Arimathea, the man who gave Jesus a decentburial; if the monks faked the grave of Arthur, why did they not go on and fakeSaint Joseph’s too?So, on the whole, there can be no doubt that King Arthur – or rather, GeneralArturius – really existed and that he deserved his reputation as a great hero.Dozens of questions still remain, but some of these are slowly being answered.For example, many scholars believe that we now know the location of KingArthur’s court at Camelot. In 1542 a writer named John Leland wrote that afortified hill in South Cadbury, Somerset, was, in fact, “Camallate, sometime afamous town or castle . . . Arthur much resorted to Camallate”. In 1966excavations were begun at Cadbury Castle (not a castle in the medieval sense,but a fortified hill). On top of Roman remains were found the foundations ofimpressive buildings that were clearly occupied, in Arthur’s period, by achieftain of considerable power and authority.Even Geoffrey of Monmouth’s absurd story about Tintagel Castle begins to look asif it has some foundation. The present Tintagel Castle was built around 1140, atthe time of Geoffrey’s History. Historians have pointed out that in the time ofKing Arthur there was only a Celtic monastery on the site. In 1924 the“visionary” Rudolf Steiner visited Tintagel and devoted a lecture to it,identifying various places as the Hall of the Round Table, the sleeping place ofthe knights, and so on. It all sounded like pure fantasy.But in the dry summer of 1983 a fire on the island destroyed the grass, and windand rain went on to reveal the foundations of more than a hundred smallrectangular buildings and of a hall more than eighty feet long. Down below, atthe foot of the cliff, is a small natural harbor, and pottery discovered on theisland indicated that large quantities of wine and oil were once imported.(There is more imported pottery on the site than on all the other British andIrish sites put together.) A stone “footprint” on the opposite side of theisland looks out over old Celtic Christian burial mounds; such a “footprint” wasoften made by a chieftain who planted his foot and surveyed his kingdom. (Inthis case, he would have looked across to the graves of his ancestors.) All thissounds as if Tintagel were once the fortress of a considerable chieftain, notsimply a monastery. The objection that Tintagel was essentially uninhabited inthe time of Arthur cannot be sustained.So the evidence for the real historical existence of King Arthur is very strongindeed. In a book entitled Arthur: Roman Britain’s Last Champion, BeramSaklatvala has even argued that there is evidence for the existence of the swordExcalibur and of the Holy Grail. The Latin word for stone is saxo, which isclose to “Saxon”. If some early chronicle mentioned Arthur taking a sword from aSaxon – some warrior he had killed – then it could well have been the origin ofthe legend of the sword in the stone. Geoffrey of Monmouth calls Arthur’s swordCaliburn; and Caliburn is a combination of two words for “river” – the Celticcale and the Saxon burn. Swords need, of course, to be tempered in cold water,and as the Anglo-Saxon word cale means “cold”, caliburn could be translated as“the cold stream”. So Arthur’s sword could have been named after the stream itwas tempered in, the Cale, near Sturminster, in Dorset.As to the Grail – the cup that Jesus was supposed to have used at the LastSupper and that Joseph of Arimathea is said to have brought to Glastonbury –this was probably a much larger vessel, too large for a drinking cup, that wasused for ritual purposes. In 1959 a large marble urn was found duringexcavations of a Roman palace in North Africa; the palace dated from the sameperiod as did Arthur. The urn had a cross carved on it, and the lid had rivetholes in the shape of a cross, indicating that it had once had a metal cross onit. The urn probably contained the bones of a saint and was almost certainlyused for administering oaths, as we now swear on the Bible. A libation holesuggests that it was used in some special ritual. Arthur would fairly certainlyhave had a similar urn in his own chapel for the administering of oaths. If thissacred vessel had been captured during one of Arthur’s many wars, Saklatvalasuggests, then the quest for the Grail could well have been based on fact.But what of the magician Merlin? Surely he was an invention of Geoffrey ofMonmouth? In fact, Geoffrey followed up his successful History with a Life ofMerlin, a poem written for a smaller audience. If Geoffrey had invented Merlin,we would expect the poet more or less to repeat the story as told in the History– or at least, not to contradict it. Merlin was obviously a great deal olderthan Arthur, for he was a boy when King Vortigern was alive – and the monkGildas tells us that Vortigern made the fatal mistake of inviting the Saxonsinto England in AD 443. Yet in the Merlin poem, Geoffrey has Merlin fightingwith a king named Rodarcus against a Scottish king named Guennolous – and thesereal historical characters lived a century later, after the death of Arthur.Geoffrey is aware of this and explains it by saying that Merlin lived to aphenomenally old age – more than a century. But it looks as if Geoffrey hasfound material about Merlin that obliges him to try to explain why his originaldates were wrong.The explanation that is accepted by most scholars is that Merlin was based on aWelsh bard named Myrddin, who was alive after AD 573. The Welsh language onlycame into existence after the death of Arthur, so Myrddin could not have beenolder than Arthur. This identification of Merlin with Myrddin is accepted byRobert Graves in his mythological study The White Goddess (1948) and by NicolaiTolstoy in The Quest for Merlin (1985). But it is obviously a somewhatdisappointing theory, for if it is correct, Merlin was not even called Merlin.(The usual view is that Geoffrey of Monmouth changed Myrddin to Merlin becausemerde in French means “shit”, and a magician named Myrddin would have invitedridicule in an age when England was ruled by the French.) Moreover, Myrddincannot have known Arthur, for even if their lives overlapped, he would only havebeen a child at the time of Arthur’s death. Geoffrey Ashe agrees that Merlin isMyrddin and that Geoffrey of Monmouth made him Arthur’s senior merely for thesake of a good story.The American professor Norma Lorre Goodrich rejects this notion in her bookMerlin (1988) and argues convincingly that Merlin was a real person who wasabout thirty years older than Arthur, although she agrees that some of thelegends of Myrddin have been incorporated into the Merlin story. She suggeststhat Arthur’s Merlin was born in Wales and buried in Scotland. In fact, she endsby suggesting that “Merlin” was a title rather than a name (a merlin is a typeof hawk) and that the original Merlin was a bishop named Dubricius, who crownedArthur. Myrddin, on the other hand, was a “Wild Man of the Woods”, a poet whowent mad, lived in the wilderness, and achieved certain magical powers. ThisMerlin is, in fact, the one Geoffrey of Monmouth learned about after writing hisHistory. His Life of Merlin is, indeed, about a Welsh leader and prophet whowent mad after fighting in a battle against a Scottish king and who became awanderer in the wilderness, delivering a great many prophecies. The Merlin ofthe History is also, we may recall, a prophet: in fact, Geoffrey published abook of Merlin’s prophecies first, then incorporated them into the History. Itsounds as if he learned about the Welsh prophet Myrddin after writing theHistory and decided that Myrddin and Merlin must be the same person. NicolaiTolstoy agrees with this theory and devotes much of his Quest for Merlin to ananalysis of various poems and legends that tell of the “Wild Man of the Woods”.It would seem, then, that we have two contesting theories: that there were twoMerlins, a view first suggested by Giraldus Cambrensis; and that there was onlyone Merlin, who was really called Myrddin and who was a Welsh bard andsoothsayer. Yet Goodrich and Tolstoy both argue their theories so brilliantlythat it seems a pity to have to choose one or the other. Goodrich is mostconvincing on the subject of the two Merlins and in her argument that theoriginal Merlin was the counselor of King Arthur. But Tolstoy has someprofoundly important things to say about Merlin the Wizard.To understand what he is suggesting, we have to forget our modern images ofwizards and magicians, derived from Shakespeare’s Prospero, Tolkien’s Gandalf,and T. H. White’s amiable and bumbling Merlin. These are recent inventions. Inthe age of Arthur a magician would have been a combination of a priest and awitch doctor, a shaman.For an account of a magician in action, it is necessary to turn to A Pattern ofIslands, Arthur Grimble’s account of his years as Land Commissioner in theGilbert Islands in the South Pacific. Told that he ought to eat porpoise flesh,Grimble inquired how he could obtain some. He was told that some islandersfarther up the coast were the hereditary porpoise-callers of the island and thathis informant’s cousin could also call them. Grimble was invited to the village,where a feast was laid out. The fat and friendly porpoise-caller retired intohis hut, and for several hours there was silence. Then the man rushed out andfell on his face, crying, “They come, they come”! The villagers all rushed intothe water and stood breast-deep, and to Grimble’s amazement, hundreds ofporpoises began to swim in to the shore. It seemed that they were in a trance.The “hypnotized” porpoises were then gently lifted into boats, taken ashore, andslaughtered.It is not difficult to hypnotize animals, and it has been argued elsewhere inthis book (see chapter 25) that hypnosis may involve a kind of telepathy. But“hypnosis” of porpoises from a distance sounds absurd.Absurd or not, it seems fairly clear that this is a power possessed by manyprimitive witch doctors and shamans. The study of modern primitives leaves nodoubt that Stone Age cave drawings of “magicians” dressed in animal skins arenot a form of Palaeolithic art but are dipictions of rituals that were designedto attract animals into the vicinity of the hunters, exactly as Grimble’s shamansummoned porpoises. A remarkable book, Wizard of the Upper Amazon by F. BruceLamb, describes the experiences of a Peruvian named Manuel Cordova, who waskidnapped by Amahuaca Indians and spent his life among them. Lamb makes it clearthat the primitive hunters of the twentieth century use exactly the sametechniques as their Stone Age counterparts. Cordova describes how the hunterskill the sow who leads a herd of pigs, then bury the head with ritual chants, toensure that the herd will always return that way. And in one remarkable sequencehe describes how the Indians drink a “vision extract” called hini xuma, and howthey then shared visions of snakes, birds, and animals; a black leopard appearsamong them at the height of the ceremony but does no one any harm.In another firsthand narrative of years spent among the natives of Papua, NewGuinea, Mitsinari (1954), Father André Dupreyat gives an account of a sorcerernamed Isidoro who can turn himself into a cassowary (a kind of ostrich) and isconsequently able to make a five-hour journey over a mountain in two hours. Healso describes his own clash with sorcerers who place him under a “snake curse”,after which snakes attack him on several occasions. (Snakes will normally dotheir best to escape from the vicinity of human beings.)1[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2233391]So it is a mistake to think of a magician as a Walt Disney cartoon characterwearing a tall conical hat with stars painted on it. Real sorcerers are closelyrelated to modern “spirit mediums”; they assert that their power comes fromspirits. Modern “magicians” – such as the notorious Aleister Crowley – believethat power can be obtained over spirits by the use of certain precise rituals,which must be performed with punctilious accuracy.The traditional role of tribal witch doctors and shamans is as intermediariesbetween human beings and the spirit world, and their chief function is to ensuregood hunting or good harvests. Celtic druids belonged to this tradition.Druidism was a form of nature worship; it came to Britain around 600 BC with theCelts, but many older forms of nature religion had existed long before that:Stonehenge, for example, was a temple for such worship and is precisely alignedto the stars.Nicolai Tolstoy is convinced that Merlin was “the last of the druids”. Druidismwas driven into Wales with the Celts and survived there long after Christianityhad stamped it out in the rest of the British Isles. Tolstoy points out that theMyrddin stories – particularly those of bards like Taliesin – are full of cluesthat link the magician with druidism. He invokes sacred apple trees (the druidsworshiped in sacred groves) and has as familiars a pig and a wolf. He takes onmany of the characteristics of the horned god of pagan mythology. Tolstoy placesthe “wood of Calidon”, to which Merlin fled after going mad, in Scotland, nearHart Fell, where the rivers Annan and Clyde both have their source. And,according to Tolstoy, Merlin fulfilled his own prophecy that he would meet a“threefold death”, clubbed, speared, and drowned. After being beaten for days byshepherds, he slipped into the river Tweed and was impaled on a stake before hedrowned.Professor Goodrich prefers the traditional story, in which Merlin is murdered bya maiden named Ninian or Nimue, the Lady of the Lake (also called Vivian), ofwhom he becomes enamored and to whom he offers to teach magic. She refuses tobecome his mistress and finally uses one of his own spells to bind him andentomb him in a cave under an enormous rock. Another commentator has argued thatthe maiden Nimue is actually the Christian Saint Nimue and that the story of herfinal triumph over Merlin is really the triumph of Christianity over paganism.The books by Nicolai Tolstoy and Norma Lorre Goodrich are rich and complexdetective stories that will leave most readers in a state of “enlightenedconfusion”. The final picture that emerges is of a real King Arthur, who was oneof the greatest generals of the Dark Ages, and of a real Merlin, a shaman anddruid, who was Arthur’s counselor and adviser. Both were men of such remarkablestature that, even within a few decades of their deaths, they became the subjectof endless legends. The legends have blurred the reality to such an extent thatit is now virtually impossible to discern the outline of the real men who livedsometime between AD 450 and 550. But the outcome of all the detective work is atleast a certainty that they actually existed."},{"pageContent":"2 AtlantisThe Submerged ContinentAtlantis has been described as the greatest of all historical mysteries. Plato,writing about 350 BC, was the first to speak of the great island in the AtlanticOcean which had vanished “in a day and a night”, and been submerged beneath thewaves of the Atlantic.Plato’s account in the two late dialogues of Timaeus and Critias has theabsorbing quality of good science fiction. The story is put into the mouth ofthe poet and historian Critias, who tells how Solon, the famous Athenianlawgiver, went to Saïs in Egypt about 590 BC, and heard the story of Atlantisfrom an Egyptian priest. According to the priest, Atlantis was already a greatcivilization when Athens had been founded about 9600 BC. It was then “a mightypower that was aggressing wantonly against the whole of Europe and Asia, and towhich your city [Athens] put an end”. Atlantis, said the priest, was “beyond thepillars of Hercules” (the Straits of Gibraltar), and was larger than Libya andAsia put together. It was “a great and wonderful empire” which had conqueredLibya and Europe as far as Tyrrhenia (Etruria in central Italy). Deserted bytheir allies, the Athenians fought alone against Atlantis, and finally conqueredthem. But at this point violent floods and earthquakes destroyed both theAthenians and the Atlantians, and Atlantis sank beneath the waves in a singleday and night.In the second dialogue, the Critias, Plato goes into far more detail about thehistory and geography of the lost continent. He tells how Poseidon (Neptune),the sea god, founded the Atlantian race by fathering ten children on a mortalmaiden, Cleito, whom he kept on a hill surrounded by canals. The Atlantians weregreat engineers and architects, building palaces, harbours, temples and docks;their capital city was built on the hill, which was surrounded by concentricbands of land and water, joined by immense tunnels, large enough for a ship tosail through. The city was about eleven miles in diameter. A huge canal, 300feet wide and 100 feet deep, connected the outermost of these rings of water tothe sea. Behind the city there was a plain 230 by 340 miles, and on this farmersgrew the city’s food supply. Behind the plain there were mountains with manywealthy villages and with fertile meadows and all kinds of livestock. Plato goesinto great detail about the city, suggesting either that he had been told thestory at length or that he had the gifts of a novelist. The long account ofmagnificent buildings with hot and cold fountains, communal dining halls andstone walls plated with precious metals has fascinated generations of readersfor more than two thousand years.But eventually, says Critias, the Atlantians began to lose the wisdom and virtuethey inherited from the god, and became greedy, corrupt and domineering. ThenZeus decided to teach them a lesson. So he called all the gods together . . .And there, frustratingly, Plato’s story breaks off. He never completed theCritias, or wrote the third dialogue that would complete the trilogy, theHermocrates. But we may probably assume that the final punishment of theAtlantians was the destruction of their continent.Many later scholars and commentators assumed that Atlantis was a myth, or thatPlato intended it as a political allegory: even Plato’s pupil Aristotle is onrecord as disbelieving it. Yet this seems unlikely. The Timaeus, the dialogue inwhich he first tells the story, is one of his most ambitious works; histranslator Jowett called it “the greatest effort of the human mind to conceivethe world as a whole which the genius of antiquity has bequeathed to us”. So itseems unlikely that Plato decided to insert a fairy tale into the middle of it;it seems more likely that he wanted to preserve the story for futuregenerations.For more than two thousand years the story of Atlantis remained a mereinteresting curiosity. But in the late nineteenth century an Americancongressman named Ignatius Donnelly became fascinated by it, and the result wasa book called Atlantis, the Antediluvian World (1882), which became a bestsellerand has been in print ever since. Even a century later, the book remainssurprisingly readable and up to date. Donnelly asks whether it is possible thatPlato was recording a real catastrophe, and concludes that it was. He points outthat modern earthquakes and volcanic eruptions have caused tremendous damage,and that there is evidence that the continent of Australia is the only visiblepart of a continent that stretched from Africa to the Pacific, and whichscientists have named Lemuria. (Lemuria was named by the zoologist L.P. Sclater,who noted that lemurs existed from Africa to Madagascar, and suggested that asingle land-mass had once connected the two.) He also studied flood legends fromEgypt to Mexico, pointing out their similarities, and indicated all kinds ofaffinities connecting artifacts from both sides of the Atlantic. He notes thatthere is a mid-Atlantic ridge, and that the Azores seem to be the mountain-topsof some large submerged island. Donnelly’s knowledge of geology, geography,cultural history and linguistics appears encyclopedic. The British primeminister Gladstone was so impressed by the book that he tried to persuade thecabinet to allot funds to sending a ship to trace the outlines of Atlantis. (Hefailed.)Writing seventy years later in his book Lost Continents, the American writer L.Sprague de Camp commented on this impressive theory: “Most of Donnelly’sstatements of facts, to tell the truth, either were wrong when he made them, orhave been disproved by subsequent discoveries”. And he goes on to say: “It isnot true, as he stated, that the Peruvian Indians had a system of writing, thatthe cotton plants native to the New and Old Worlds belong to the same species,that Egyptian civilisation sprang suddenly into being, or that Hannibal usedgunpowder in his military operations . . .” De Camp demonstrates that Donnelly’sscholarship is not as reliable as it looks; but there is still a great deal inthe 490-page book that he leaves unchallenged.Five years before the publication of Donnelly’s book, the subject of Atlantishad been raised in an immense two-volume work called Isis Unveiled by theRussian “occultist” Helena Blavatsky, who had dashed off its fifteen hundredpages at a speed that suggests automatic writing. But her comments on Atlantisoccupy only one single page of Volume One (593), in which she explains that theinhabitants of Atlantis were the fourth race on earth, and that they were allnatural “mediums”. Having acquired their knowledge without effort, this peoplewas an easy prey for “the great and invisible dragon” King Thevetat, whocorrupted them so that they became “a nation of wicked magicians”. They starteda war which ended in the submersion of Atlantis . . .Isis Unveiled astonished its publisher by becoming a best-seller; it made itsauthor a celebrity, and she went on to leave New York for India and to found theTheosophical Society. After a shattering expose in which she was declared afraud, she returned to London and died of Bright’s disease at the age of sixtyin 1891. But she left behind her the manuscript of a book that was even largerand more confusing than Isis Unveiled, a book called The Secret Doctrine. Thisis a commentary on a mystical work called The Book of Dzyan, allegedly writtenin Atlantis in the Senzar language, and it explains that man is not the firstintelligent race on earth. The first “root race” consisted of invisible beingsmade of fire mist, the second lived in northern Asia, the third lived on thelost island continent of Lemuria or Mu in the Indian Ocean, and consisted ofape-like giants who lacked reason. The fourth root race were the Atlantians, whoachieved a high degree of civilization, but were destroyed when the island sankafter a battle between selfish magicians. The present human species is the fifthroot race, and we are the most “solid” so far; the sixth and seventh thatsucceed us will be more ethereal. According to Madame Blavatsky, all knowledgeof the past is imprinted on a kind of psychic ether called Akasa, and thisknowledge is called the Akasic records. She also claims that the survivors ofAtlantis peopled Egypt and built the pyramids about a hundred thousand yearsago. (Modern scholarship dates the earliest about 2500 BC.)By the time The Secret Doctrine appeared, Donnelly’s book had popularized thesubject of Atlantis. A leading member of the Theosophical Society in London, W.Scott-Elliot, now produced a work called The Story of Atlantis (1896), whichachieved immense popularity; Scott-Elliot claimed to possess the ability to readthe Akasic records. He made the astonishing claim that Atlantian civilizationwas flourishing a million years ago. There were seven sub-races, one of which,the Toltecs, conquered the whole continent and built a magnificent city, whichis described by Plato. When some of the Atlantians practised black magic, agreat lodge of initiates moved to Egypt and founded a dynasty; others builtStonehenge in England.Scott-Elliot later used his insight into the Akasic records to write an equallystartling book about Lemuria. Both books are regarded together with IsisUnveiled and The Secret Doctrine as basic scriptures of the TheosophicalSociety.After Madame Blavatsky, the most influential of all Theosophists was theAustrian Rudolf Steiner, who quarrelled with the British Theosophists anddeveloped his own system of “occult philosophy” known as Anthroposophy. In 1904,before the break, Steiner produced a work called From the Akashic Records(Akashic being an alternative spelling), which deals with Atlantis and Lemuria.It would be easy to dismiss this as yet another production of the lunaticfringe; yet, like most of Steiner’s work, it has a solid core of intellectualunderstanding that rings true. Steiner thinks in terms of the evolution ofworlds, and according to his scheme, higher beings called hierarchies are incharge of the process. The basic aim of evolution is for spirit to conquer therealm of matter. Man began as a completely etherialized being, and has becomesteadily more solid with each step in his evolution. But the increase insolidity has meant that he has become a slave to matter. When, after evolvingthrough three earlier “worlds”, man was reborn on our present earth, his bodywas little more than a cloud of vapour. By the time he had developed to the“third root race” (the Lemurians) he had learned the secret of telepathy, and ofdirect use of his will-power. Fear, illness and death entered human historyduring this period. In the next epoch of Atlantis man was able to control thevegetable life forces and use these as an energy source; he was unable to reasonbut possessed an abnormally powerful memory. But hostile forces which Steinercalled Ahriman pushed man into mere scientific achievement; he becameincreasingly corrupt and egotistic, and his attempt to use destructive forcesfinally caused the catastrophe that overwhelmed Atlantis . . . Unlike MadameBlavatsky, Steiner dates this catastrophe around 8000 BC, which places it withinthe realm of reasonable possibility. (It is true that, according toarchaeological research, the first mesolithic farmers had only just made theirappearance on earth at this time. However, one American professor of history,Charles Hapgood, has argued seriously that certain “maps of the ancient seakings” suggest that there was an advanced civilization covering the globe in8000 BC, see chapter 25.)Just as it began to look as if Atlantis had fallen into the hands of occultistsand the purveyors of science fiction, a new and more serious advocate appearedon the scene. Lewis Spence was a Scottish newspaper editor who also wrotescholarly studies of the mythologies of Babylonia, Egypt, Mexico and CentralAmerica. His Problem of Atlantis appeared in 1924, and, like Donnelly’s book,reached a wide audience. What Spence proposed was that there is geologicalevidence for the existence of a great continent in the Atlantic region in lateMiocene times (25 to 10 million years ago). It disintegrated into smaller islandmasses, the two largest of which were in the Atlantic close to theMediterranean. Another large island existed in the region of the West Indies.Further disintegration of the eastern continent began about 25,000 years ago,and it finally vanished about 10,000 years ago, as Plato said. The othercontinent to the west – Antillia – survived until more recently. Spence arguedthat man was not a seafarer ten thousand years ago (Hapgood would probablydisagree) so there should be evidence of the inhabitants of Atlantis takingrefuge in nearby lands. Studying the coast of south-western France, northernSpain and the Bay of Biscay, Spence adduces evidence that three primitive races,the Cro-Magnon, the Caspian and the Azilian, all migrated from the west. Hebelieves that Cro-Magnon man arrived about 25,000 years ago and wiped outNeanderthal man. (Modern students of prehistory would place the date of thedisappearance of Neanderthal at least ten thousand years earlier than this.)The Caspian and Azilian people came 15,000 years later; the Azilians are knownto have used boats for deep-sea fishing, and Spence reasons that the land bridgethat had joined Atlantis and Europe had now ceased to exist. Spence believedthat the Azilians founded the civilizations of Egypt and Crete. Other“Atlantians” fled westward to Antillia, and remained there until it was alsopartly submerged some time before the Christian era; its inhabitants became theMayans. (This identification of the Mayans with Atlantians is one of the usualfeatures of Atlantis speculation.) One of Spence’s odder theories is thatlemmings – the small rodents who often drown themselves in large numbers – areattempting to migrate back to Atlantis. In fact, we now know that lemmings aresimply responding to overcrowding, like so many other animals, and that masssuicide is not one of their usual habits – they simply tend to disperse randomlyfrom areas where the birth rate has risen too steeply.There are other objections to Spence’s theory. He argues that the cultures ofEgypt, Crete and South America appeared suddenly; archaeology has sinceestablished that this is untrue; they evolved slowly from primitive beginnings.Nevertheless, there is a great deal in Spence’s first three Atlantis books – TheProblem of Atlantis was followed by Atlantis in America and The History ofAtlantis – that deserves to be taken seriously. The same cannot be said of thetwo later books: Will Europe Follow Atlantis?, in which he speculates whetherthe modern world is plunging into the same wicked excesses that destroyedAtlantis (this was in the Hitler period) and The Occult Sciences in Atlantis, inwhich he is inclined to build bricks without straw (“the reader must bear inmind that here we are dealing with the question of Alchemy in Atlantis only . ..”) But altogether, Spence is probably the most interesting and reliable writeron Atlantis, and his Problem of Lemuria shows the same sober, scholarlyapproach, even though he is forced to rely too heavily on speculation andguesswork.Spence advised Conan Doyle on his Atlantis novel The Maracot Deep, and alsocorresponded with the explorer Colonel Percy H. Fawcett, who was convinced thatBrazil was part of ancient Atlantis – a theory Doyle utilized in The Lost World.The novelist Rider Haggard presented Fawcett with a basalt image inscribed withcharacters, and when the British Museum was unable to identify it, Fawcett tookit to a psychometrist (psychometry is the ability to “read” the history of anobject by holding it in the hands).2[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2233663] Although thepsychometrist had no clue to Fawcett’s identity, he told him: “I see a largeirregularly shaped continent stretching from the north coast of Africa across toSouth America. Numerous mountains are spread over its surface, and here andthere a volcano looks as though about to erupt. . . On the African side of thecontinent the population is sparse. The people are well-formed, but of a variednondescript class, very dark complexioned though not negroid. Their moststriking feature are high cheek bones and eyes of piercing brilliance. I shouldsay their morals leave much to be desired, and their worship borders ondemonology . . .”On the western side, the inhabitants are “far superior to the others. Thecountry is hilly and elabourate temples are partly hewn from the faces of thecliffs, their projecting facades supported by beautifully carved columns . . .Within the temples it is dark, but over the altars is the representation of alarge eye. The priests are making invocations to this eye and the whole ritualseems to be of an occult nature, coupled with a sacrificial . . . Placed atvarious parts of the temple are a few effigies like the one in my hand – andthis one was evidently the portrait of a priest of very high rank”.The psychometrist went on to say that this image would eventually come into thepossession of a reincarnation of the priest “when numerous forgotten things willthrough its influence be elucidated”. “The teeming population of the westerncities seems to consist of three classes; the hierarchy and the ruling partyunder an hereditary monarch, a middle class, and the poor or slaves. Thesepeople are absolute masters of the world, and by a great many of them the blackarts are practised to an alarming extent”. The psychometrist went on to describehow, as punishment for presumption, the land is destroyed by volcanic eruptions,and sinks beneath the sea. “I can get no definite date of the catastrophe, butit was long prior to the rise of Egypt, and has been forgotten except, perhaps,in myth”.So Fawcett became a firm believer in the reality of Atlantis, and consideredthat he would find further evidence for it in certain lost jungle cities ofBrazil and Bolivia. He had another reason for wishing to go to the Mato Grossoof south-western Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro he had found an old document inPortuguese written by a man called Francisco Raposo, who had gone into thejungle in 1743 in search of the lost mines of Muribeca – Muribeca being the sonof a Portuguese adventurer and an Indian woman. According to Raposo’s manuscript(which is cited in Fawcett’s posthumous book Exploration Fawcett), he found aremarkable ruined city that had obviously been destroyed by earthquakes,“tumbled columns and blocks weighing perhaps fifty tons and more”. Afterspending some time in this ruined city, Raposo and his party made their way backto Bahia, where he wrote his account for the viceroy, who pigeonholed it.So when Fawcett finally set off in 1924, after endless frustrations and delays,he had a threefold objective: the search for the mines of Muribeca, for the lostcity of Raposo, and for Atlantian remains like his basalt idol. With his sonJack and a friend named Raleigh Rimell, he made his way finally to Dead HorseCamp in the Xingu Basin, where he took a final photograph of Jack and Rimell. On29 May 1924 he wrote a final note to his wife. Then all three men vanished. In1932 a Swiss trapper named Rattin reported that Fawcett was a prisoner of anIndian tribe. Rattin himself went in search of the “white colonel”, but neverreturned. Various other rumours about Fawcett were carried back by explorers andmissionaries, and in 1951 the chief of the Kalapalos tribe, Izarari, made adeathbed confession to killing Fawcett and his companions. He had refusedFawcett carriers and canoes, “on grounds of intertribal strife”, and Fawcettslapped his face, whereupon the chief had clubbed him to death, then killed theother two men when they attacked him. He also alleged that Jack Fawcett had beenconsorting with one of his wives, and the Brazilian who reported this storymentioned that the chief’s eldest son seemed to have white blood. However, ateam of experts announced that bones found in a jungle grave were not those ofColonel Fawcett; so the mystery of his disappearance remains unsolved. It haseven been suggested that Fawcett found his lost city and preferred to stay thererather than return to civilization . . .Other students of the Atlantis myth preferred to believe that it was to be foundon the other side of the Atlantic ocean. A group of German archaeologists namedSchulten, Herman, Jessen and Hennig began searching for another lost city,Tartessos, in 1905; it was supposed to be on the Atlantic coast of Spain nearthe mouth of the Guadalquivir, and had been captured by the Carthaginians in 533BC. They believed that the lost Tartessos had been Plato’s Atlantis – it wascertainly on the right side of the Straits of Gibraltar. Another archaeologist,Elena Maria Whishaw, also spent twenty-five years studying the same area –around the ancient fortress of Niebla – and was led by evidence of masonry andskilled hydraulic engineering in the Rio Tinto mines to the conclusion thatAndalusia had once been colonized by people from North Africa who had fled fromAtlantis. This explains the title of her book, Atlantis in Andalusia (1930).By the 1930s another interesting theory of the destruction of Atlantis hadgained millions of followers; it was the work of a Viennese mining engineernamed Hans Hoerbiger (1860–1931). As a child Hoerbiger had been an amateurastronomer, and while he was looking at the moon and the planets through atelescope he was suddenly struck by the certainty that the way they reflect thesunlight indicates that they are covered in ice. Later he saw waterlogged soilexploding with puffs of steam, as molten iron ran over it, and thought he sawthe answer to the explosive energies of the universe. Space, according toHoerbiger, is full of hydrogen and oxygen, although in an extremely rarifiedstate. (This is certainly true of hydrogen!) This condenses around small starsas ice, and when these balls of ice fall into a hot star there is a tremendousexplosion – the same kind of explosion that formed our solar system. Most of theplanets, Hoerbiger insisted, are covered with a layer of ice hundreds of milesthick, while our present moon has an ice-covering 125 miles thick. It isnecessary to speak of our present moon (Luna) because it is only the latest of aconsiderable number, perhaps as many as six. The natural movement of allplanetary bodies, says Hoerbiger, is a spiral, and the planets are spiralling intowards the sun like the needle on a gramaphone record. Small objects movefaster than large ones, so as they spiral past larger planets they are likely tobe captured and become “moons”. A quarter of a million years ago our earth hadanother moon – a captured comet. When this approached close to the earth it wasmoving so fast that it caused the seas to bunch together into a ridge of waterthat had not time to retreat. The rest of the earth became covered with ice;human beings were forced to move to the tops of mountains, like those ofEthiopia and Peru. (Colonel Fawcett also believed that Tiahuanaco, in thePeruvian Andes, contained evidence of some mysterious lost civilization.) Thelighter gravity at these heights turned men into giants – hence the comment inthe Bible that there were “giants in the earth” in those days. When the moonfinally exploded the result was a great flood, like the one recorded in theBible and in many other sacred books. When the earth captured our present moon(about twelve thousand years ago) the result was again a tremendous flood,together with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and this destroyed Atlantisand Lemuria.Hoerbiger died in 1931, but his work was continued by one of his foremostdisciples, Hans Schindler Bellamy. Bellamy was an Austrian, whose book Moon,Myths and Man – published in the year of Hoerbiger’s death – made thousands ofconverts in England and America. Hoerbiger’s German converts included Hitler,who proposed to build an observatory dedicated to the three greatest astronomersof all time, Ptolemy, Copernicus and Hoerbiger. Hitler’s belief in Hoerbiger mayhave cost him the war. A weather bureau based on Hoerbiger’s principles forecasta mild winter for 1941–2, and Hitler sent his troops into Russia in light summeruniforms . . . Hoerbiger continued to have hosts of disciples until the 1960s,when space exploration finally made it clear that his belief that the moon andplanets were covered in thick ice was erroneous.The chief problem with “crank” books like Hoerbiger’s Glacial Cosmogony (1913)is that they often contain more than a grain of truth. This is certainly thecase with that astonishing bestseller of the 1950s, Worlds in Collision, byImmanuel Velikovsky. Velikovsky, a Russian Jew born in 1895, was startled andimpressed by Freud’s book Moses and Monotheism, which suggested that Moses wasnot a Jew but an Egyptian, and that he was a follower of the “sun-worshipping”pharaoh Akhnaton. Velikovsky reached the even more startling conclusion thatAkhnaton was the Greek king Oedipus. In 1939, the year he moved from Palestineto the United States, Velikovsky was much preoccupied with Hoerbiger’s theory,but finally decided against it. But he was impressed by the theory of W.Whiston, Newton’s successor at Cambridge, that the comet of 1680 had caused theBiblical deluge on an earlier encounter. He also encountered Donnelly’sRagnarok, The Age of Fire and Ice (1883), successor to Atlantis, in whichDonnelly concludes that the “drift”, the vast deposit of sand, gravel and claywhich lies in irregular patches over much of the earth’s surface, was the resultof a tremendous explosion that occurred when a comet struck the earth. Whistonand Donnelly were seminal influences on the book Velikovsky now went on towrite, Worlds in Collision (see Chapter 40), in which a close brush with a cometis blamed for the destruction of Atlantis, as well as for various Biblicalcatastrophes.A rather more credible theory of Atlantis was propounded in the late 1960s by aGreek archaeologist, Professor Angelos Galanopoulos, based on the discoveries ofProfessor Spyridon Marinatos on the island of Santorini or Thera, in theMediterranean. Around the year 1500 BC a tremendous volcanic explosion rippedapart Santorini, and probably destroyed most of the civilization of the Greekislands, the coastal regions of eastern Greece, and of northern Crete. This,Galanopoulos suggests, was the catastrophe that destroyed Atlantis. But surelythe date is wrong? – the destruction of Santorini took place a mere nine hundredyears before Solon, not nine thousand. This is the essence of Galanopoulos’sargument – he believes that a scribe accidentally multiplied all the figures byten. He points out that all Plato’s figures seem far too large. The 10,000stadia (1,150 mile) ditch around the plain would stretch around modern Londontwenty times. The width and depth of the canal 300 feet wide and 100 feet deepseems absurd; surely 30 feet wide by 10 feet would be more likely? As to theplain behind the city, 23 by 34 miles would be a more reasonable size than 230by 340 miles. If all Plato’s figures are reduced in this way, then Santorinibegins to sound altogether more like Atlantis although Galanopoulos suggeststhat the Atlantian civilization stretched all over the Mediterranean, and thatCrete itself was probably the Royal City. And how could such a mistake comeabout? Galanopoulos suggests that the Greek copyist mistook the Egyptian symbolfor 100 – a coiled rope – for the symbol for 1,000 – a lotus flower.There is only one major objection to all this: Plato states clearly thatAtlantis was beyond the Pillars of Hercules. Galanopoulos argues that Herculesperformed most of his labours in the Peloponnese, and that the Pillars ofHercules could well refer to the two extreme southern promontories of Greece,Cape Matapan and Cape Maleas. But Plato says clearly: “They [the Atlantians]held sway . . . over the country within the pillars as far as Egypt andTyrrhenia”. And no amount of revisionary geography can place Egypt and Etruriawithin the promontories of Greece. So another fascinating theory must bereluctantly abandoned. But the notion that Santorini was the legendary Atlantishas brought thousands of tourists to the island and greatly improved its economy. . .In 1975 a symposium held at the University of Indiana discussed the question:Atlantis, fact or fiction? Various experts stated their views, and reached thepredictable conclusion that Atlantis was a myth. And it must be admitted that,apart from the kind of “cultural” evidence adduced by Donnelly, Spence andWhishaw, there is not one grain of solid proof of the existence of the sunkencontinent. And the kind of “proof” that convinced Colonel Fawcett – the evidenceof a psychometrist – is understandably dismissed by geologists, archaeologistsand classical scholars alike. Yet anyone who has studied such evidence willagree that, while it is far from convincing, it still leaves a great deal toexplain. How did Fawcett’s psychometrist come to think of Atlantis? For theevidence to be of any value, we would need to know a great deal more about thepsychometrist – whether, for example, he had read Donnelly or Spence. And if hecould convince us that his unconscious mind was not playing him tricks, therewould still remain the possibility that he was somehow reading Fawcett’s mind.Yet anyone who is willing to study the evidence for psychometry with an openmind will end by agreeing that there are many cases that cannot be explained asunconscious self-deception or telepathy.Similar questions are raised by the detailed descriptions of Atlantiancivilization produced by the “psychic healer” Edgar Cayce (pronounced Casey).When Cayce was twenty-two (in 1899) he suffered from psychosomatic paralysis ofthe vocal cords, which was cured by hypnosis. The hypnotist then asked Caycesome questions about his own medical problems, and Cayce’s replies revealed amedical knowledge that consciously he did not possess. Cayce’s ability toproduce “trance diagnosis” soon made him a minor celebrity. In 1923 Cayce wasquestioned as to whether there is life after death; when he woke from his trancehe was shocked to learn that he had been preaching the doctrine of reincarnation– as an orthodox Christian, he rejected the idea. Eventually he came to acceptit. In 1927, giving a “life reading” on a fourteen-year-old boy, Cayce describedhis previous lives under Louis XIV, Alexander the Great, in ancient Egypt, andin Atlantis. For the remainder of his life Cayce continued to add fragments tohis account of Atlantis.According to Cayce, Atlantis extended from the Sargasso Sea to the Azores, andwas about the size of Europe. It had experienced two periods of destruction, inthe first of which the mainland had divided into islands. The final break-upoccurred, as Plato said, about 10,000 BC, and the last place to sink was nearthe Bahamas. What he says echoes Steiner to a remarkable extent: “. . . manbrought in the destructive forces that combined with the natural resources ofthe gases, of the electrical forces, that made the first of the eruptions thatawoke from the depth of the slow-cooling earth . . .” He claimed that archivesdealing with Atlantis now exist in three places in the world, one of these inEgypt. In June 1940 Cayce predicted that the island called Poseidia would riseagain, “expect it in ’68 or ’69”. It would happen in the area of the Bahamas.Early in 1968 a fishing guide called Bonefish Sam took the archaeologist Dr J.Manson Valentine to see a line of rectangular stones under twenty feet of waterin North Bimini, in the Bahamas. Valentine was startled to find two parallellines of stones about 2,000 feet long. They became known as the Bimini Road. Butscientists disagreed from the beginning. John Hall, a professor of archaeologyfrom Miami, said they were natural formations; John Gifford, a marine biologist,thought that if the stones were produced by “geological stress”, then therewould be far more of them over a wider area; he concluded that “none of theevidence conclusively disproves human intervention”. One of the investigators,Dr David Zink, wrote a book called The Stones of Atlantis, and had no doubtwhatsoever that some of the stones were hand-made – in fact, one object was astone head. But even if the Bimini Road could be shown to be part of a temple,this would still not prove that it was built more than ten thousand years ago;it could be the product of a much more recent culture.Obviously, Cayce’s prediction that Atlantis would “rise again” has not beenfulfilled. This in itself does not prove the prediction to have been pureimagination; parapsychologists who have studied precognition have often notedthat the time scale is seldom correct. But it does mean that for the time beingCayce must be classified with Scott-Elliott, Steiner and Madame Blavatsky as ahighly suspect witness.Of all the theories of the destruction of Atlantis, a recent one by an Englishgeologist, Ralph Franklin Walworth, is in some ways one of the most convincing.Walworth’s book Subdue the Earth is only incidentally concerned with Atlantis;it is basically an attempt to explain the problem of the ice ages. So far nogeologist has produced a convincing theory to account for the tremendousvariations in climate that have periodically covered the earth with immensesheets of ice. Robert Ardrey’s African Genesis contains several fascinatingpages in which the various theories are outlined. A “wandering north pole” couldnot explain why the ice sheets extended down to Africa. A near-brush with acomet could not explain why there have been so many ice ages, and why they areat irregular intervals (the same comet would return regularly). A Jugoslav, M.Milankovitch, produced a marvellously convincing theory based on the known factthat our planet goes through minor cyclical variations in the weather, andargued that when such variations happen to coincide – like lightning strikingtwice in the same place – the result is an ice age. Ardrey points out that evenMilankovitch’s simultaneous variations cannot account for twenty million cubicmiles of ice. Sir George Simpson produced a highly convincing theory to theeffect that ice ages are due to a rise in solar temperature, which causes morerain to fall on highlands in the form of snow. Eventually, there is so much snowthat it cannot melt away during the summers, and an ice age begins. But ifSimpson’s theory is correct, then the seas should become a great deal warmerduring ice ages; in fact, studies of sea-bottom deposits during the Pleistocene– the last great ice age – show that there was a variation in temperature ofonly a few degrees. Ardrey’s own theory is that the earth passes periodicallythrough some vast intergalactic gas cloud, and that the earth’s magnetic fieldsucks murky gas into our atmosphere, thus excluding the sunlight. But he admitsthat his theory fails to explain why, in that case, ice ages do not occur atregular intervals . . .Walworth sets out to explain some of the problems already noted by Donnelly andVelikovsky: the evidence for great upheavals that buried whole forests. Mostgeologists, he points out, are now “Uniformitarians”; they propose that theearth has evolved very slowly over vast epochs of time, and that the greatcatastrophes (floods, earthquakes and so on) that were posited by scientists inthe eighteenth century, when the earth was thought to be only a few thousandyears old, are unnecessary to explain earth’s evolution. Walworth points outthat, be that as it may, there is still a great deal of evidence for giantcatastrophes. And he asks some simple but very puzzling questions. How, forexample, can we account for fossils? The standard explanation is that fossilizedfishes, animals, etc, became stuck in mud, which hardened around them and“preserved” them. But if a fish dies in a river it quickly decays, or is eatenby predators; even if it sinks into a few inches of mud, it still decays.Walworth believes that fossils are best formed in the presence of the “activateddust which a volcano ejects”.His theory is that ice ages are caused by tremendous volcanic eruptions, greatenough to eject gas, magma and dust far out into space. The air that was hurtledout into space would lose all its heat; when gravity pulled it back to earth itwould be “an icy, lethal gas” that would extinguish life in vast areas, andplunge even large creatures like mammoths into an instantaneous deepfreeze. Thevolcanic dust would cause an ice age. Snow would fall on high ground, until theoceans were hardly more than puddles. “The evidence from the sea floorsindicates that sea level has, for long periods of time, been three miles lowerthan it is now”. Human settlements would move to the shores of these seas, sincethe temperature close to the sea is always slightly higher than inland. The icesheets would raise soft sediments and magmas to high altitudes, where they wouldset like concrete, forming mountains and the “drift” that so puzzled Donnelly.Then, as the ice age gradually ended, the settlements would be forced to retreathigher and higher as their former homes were submerged. Some people would evenmove to mountain-tops like the civilization of Tiahuanaco. And greatcivilizations would disappear beneath the waves . . .But if this is true, then why do we not have such tremendous explosionsnowadays? Krakatoa, which erupted in 1883, and sent a giant tidal wave acrossthe Pacific, devastating whole islands, only hurled its vapours seventeen milesinto the atmosphere. Walworth points to the planet Jupiter, which producestremendous eruptions of energy every ten years, and he suggests that this isbasically an electromagnetic phenomenon: “eddy currents developed by Jupiter’smotion through the electrified solar wind cause a buildup of heat under theplanet’s surface”. Because earth is so much smaller, the same mechanism couldcause such eruptions at far longer intervals, accounting for the ice ages.Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Walworth’s theory is his suggestionthat the earth’s core may not be a mass of molten iron, as geologists believe.If volcanic activity is caused by the “electrified solar wind” acting upon theearth’s magnetic field and setting up tremendous stresses just below thesurface, then presumably the centre of the earth is relatively cool and solid.Presumably science should one day be able to develop “depth sounders” that couldprove or disprove this unorthodox notion. As far as the human race is concerned,it would probably be a relief if Walworth proved to be mistaken, since histheory also involves another catastrophic eruption over the next thousand yearsor so, followed by an ice age that would re-create the conditions that destroyedAtlantis."},{"pageContent":"3 The Baader-Meinhof GangSuicide or Murder?On the afternoon of Thursday, 13 October 1977, four Palestinians seized controlof Lufthansa Flight LH181 as it flew from Majorca to Frankfurt. Two men and twowomen held the passengers and crew at gunpoint and forced the pilot to changecourse for Rome’s Leonardo da Vinci Airport. After wiring the aircraft withexplosive charges, they issued their demands in the name of the Struggle AgainstWorld Imperialism Organization.Few informed sources were surprised when the Palestinian hijackers’ main demandturned out to be the release of “all German political prisoners”; it was an opensecret that Palestinian paramilitary organizations had close links with theleft-wing revolutionary terrorists in West Germany. The demand was later reducedto the release of eleven high-ranking members of the Red Army Faction (RAF;generally referred to by the nickname Baader-Meinhof) then in custody in theGDR.Over the next three days the hijacked jet was flown on to Cyprus and then Dubaito keep the security forces from launching an attack. Then, on Friday, 16October only hours before the ransom deadline expired, it was flown to Aden inYemen.Shortly after landing, the pilot, Jurgen Schumann, asked permission to inspectthe front landing gear, which he thought had been damaged by the last touchdown.He checked the gear, found it to be still serviceable, and started to walk back,but on the way he made the mistake of speaking to a group of airport securitymen. As he re-entered the aircraft he was made to kneel down and was “executed”in front of the other hostages with a shot through the back of the head.Schumann’s body was dumped onto the runway, and the co-pilot was forced to flythem to Mogadishu Airport in Somalia.As the deadline the terrorists had set for the destruction of the jetapproached, the West German government played for time. They offered to releasethe eleven prisoners and fly them to Mogadishu to join the Palestinians; theywould then be given a substantial sum of money and a jet to fly them whereverthey chose. The leader of the hijackers, who called himself Martyr Mahmoud,agreed to extend the deadline to facilitate the arrangements but added, “Theremust be no tricks. This will not be another Entebbe”.By “Entebbe” he was referring to a similar hijacking that had taken place a yearearlier. An Air France jet had been seized on a flight from Tel Aviv to Parisand had been flown to Entebbe Airport in Uganda. The hijackers, five Arabs andtwo Germans, had negotiated with the president of Uganda, Idi Amin, demandingthe release of fifty-three pro-Palestinian terrorists held in Israel and aroundthe world; these had included two members of the Baader-Meinhof gang and fourfrom the affiliated Second June Movement, imprisoned in West Germany.Two days later three army transport planes had landed unannounced at Entebbe;several squads of Israeli commandos had poured out onto the runway and gone onto storm both the hijacked jet and the airport’s main building. During thehour’s fighting that ensued, twenty Ugandan soldiers, one Israeli commando,three hostages, and all seven hijackers had been killed. The remaining hostageshad been rescued.Martyr Mahmoud’s misgivings in the case of the Mogadishu hijacking provedjustified. At two o’clock on the morning of Tuesday, 18 October the newly formedWest German antiterrorist squad, the GSG-9, stormed the hijacked airliner.Lighting an oil drum under the front of the aircraft to distract the terrorists,they forced the rear emergency exits and tossed in stun grenades. In theresulting confusion they engaged the hijackers in gunfire over the heads of thecrouching passengers. Within minutes three of the terrorists were dead,including the leader, and the fourth was badly wounded. This time only one ofthe ninety hostages was hurt in the cross fire, and the GSG-9 squad suffered nocasualties.The Mogadishu hijack was the third attempt within a year to force the Germanauthorities to free members of the Baader-Meinhof gang. Entebbe had been thefirst. The second had occurred five weeks before the Mogadishu incident. On 5September 1977, a sixty-one-year-old German industrialist, Dr Hans-MartinSchleyer, had been kidnapped in Cologne by the RAF; his driver was killed bysubmachine gun fire; so were three armed guards who were driving immediatelybehind him. His ransom demand included the same eleven RAF members laterdemanded by the Mogadishu hijackers. (In fact, both ransom notes proved to havebeen written on the same typewriter.)The Mogadishu hijack ended at 2:15 on the morning of Tuesday, 18 October 1977.Shortly after 7:30 the same morning, guards at Stammheim Prison in Stuttgart,West Germany, began to take breakfast around to the prisoners in theseventh-floor cells. Baader-Meinhof terrorist Jan-Carl Raspe, who was serving alife sentence for the murder of four American soldiers in a bombing incident,was found propped up in bed with a bullet wound in his head. He was still alivebut died a few hours later. Three cells away, Andreas Baader, the leader of thegang, was found dead with a gun lying beside him. Gudrun Ensslin, Baader’smistress, was found hanging from the barred window of her cell. The fourth RAFterrorist, Irmgard Moller, was found lying in bed with four stab wounds in herchest. She underwent emergency surgery and survived.That evening the West German minister of justice, Traugott Bender, announcedthat the three RAF leaders were dead and that a fourth was seriously ill. Theyhad apparently entered into a suicide pact when the news from Mogadishu had madeit plain that they had no immediate hope of release. And although Benderinsisted that there was no suspicion of foul play, most of the world press tookthe view that the terrorists had been “executed” to circumvent furtherhijackings or kidnappings. In fact, Schleyer was murdered by his kidnappers afew hours later – they shot him three times in the head and cut his throat – andhis body was found in a car trunk in Mulhouse, France, the next day.The Baader-Meinhof story, which ended so abruptly that October morning in 1977,began in the late sixties, with the death of a student named Benno Ohnesorg, whowas shot by a West Berlin policeman in a protest demonstration against the visitof the shah of Iran. This event soured the whole tone of political debate inGermany. The sixties had been marked by left-wing protest – against the atombomb, against the Vietnam War, against capitalism in general – but it hadremained basically peaceful.Ohnesorg’s killer, Detective Sergeant Kurras, was tried on a manslaughter chargeseven months later but was acquitted on a plea that the heat of events at theprotest had affected his judgment. The radical Left was incensed by the verdict,which confirmed their view that Germany was still a fascist state. On the dayafter the shooting, Gudrun Ensslin, a tall, attractive blond dressed in thehabitual black sweater and jeans of the revolutionary Left, addressed a meetingof the Socialist German Students Union (SDS) in Berlin. Shrilly emotional to thepoint of tears, she insisted that the “fascist state” was out to kill them all.It was stupid to aim for a peaceful resolution, she told them; in order tosurvive they would have to fight violence with violence: “It’s the generation ofAuschwitz – you can’t argue with them”!Ensslin, born in 1940, was the daughter of an Evangelical pastor who was also aCommunist. She had studied philosophy at Tübingen, then moved to Berlin with theleft-wing writer Bernward Vesper, with whom she had a son.In 1967, not long after her impassioned address to the German students, Ensslinmet a good-looking, dark-eyed young man named Andreas Baader at a demonstration.At the time Baader was living with – and off – a female action painter namedElly Michell, who bore him a daughter. But this did not prevent him fromspending the night with Gudrun Ensslin, who had recently acted in a porno moviecalled Das Abonnement (Subscription).Baader was entirely without political convictions; he was more interested infast cars and women. But his own lack of money and success made him an easyconvert to the notion that society was rotten and could be improved only bybloody revolution. He deserted his action painter, Ensslin deserted herwriter-lover, and together they moved to Frankfurt, where the leftist studentmovement operated on a more sophisticated level than its Berlin counterpart.Ensslin tended to do the talking at the meetings while Baader, still out of hisdepth, maintained a tough but silent image. Ensslin was very much theintellectually dominant partner and referred to Baader as her “baby”.It was soon decided, however, that action must replace words. On 2 April 1968,Baader and Ensslin entered the Schneider department store just before closingtime. They exited shortly, leaving behind their shopping bags. At midnight firebroke out on three floors but was soon put out by the fire brigade. Thefollowing evening Baader and Ensslin were arrested at the apartment of a friend– the police spoke of a “concrete denunciation” – and identified by employees atthe department store. Two other militants – Thorwald Proll and Horst Sohnlein –who at the same time had planted a bomb that failed to go off in anotherdepartment store were also arrested. All four were sentenced to three years’imprisonment for arson. At the trial Ensslin declared, “We don’t care aboutburned mattresses. We are worried about burned children in Vietnam”.Fourteen months later all four were released pending the outcome of an appeal.They now discovered that they had become heroes within extreme-Left circles.When the time came to hear the appeal-court verdict, only Sohnlein turned up;the others – Baader, Ensslin, and Proll – had fled to Switzerland. They returnedsecretly in 1970, and in April of that year Baader was arrested as he was on hisway to dig up a cache of arms hidden in a cemetery. This time he was sent toTegel Prison in West Berlin.There he was visited by a well-known left-wing journalist named Ulrike Meinhof,who had covered the arson trial and interviewed Ensslin and Baader at the time.In a subsequent article she had stated: “It is better to burn a department storethan to own one”.At thirty-six – nine years Baader’s senior – the divorced Ulrike was somethingof a celebrity; she had written plays for radio and television, was a populartalk-show guest, and was the mother of twin daughters. In recent years, whilelecturing part-time at Berlin’s Free University, she had become increasinglyinvolved in extreme-Left student groups. Her apartment was frequently used fortheir meetings, and these were often attended by associates of Baader andEnsslin. Among these was Horst Mahler, Baader’s defense lawyer and the founderof the RAF. (Baader had been in Mahler’s car when arrested.) It was Mahler,together with the still-fugitive Ensslin, who convinced Meinhof to help in aplan to free Baader.The authorities had given Baader permission to write a book on maladjustedjuveniles and to conduct his research at the German Institute for SocialQuestions in the West Berlin suburb of Dahlem – a concession that hardly seemsto support Ensslin’s assertion that they were confronting a ruthless fasciststate.Another member of the rescue group, Peter Homann, later claimed that nopolitical motive was behind the plan. Gudrun Ensslin desperately wanted her“baby” back, and the others wanted to help her, that was all. It was only later,when they were all on the run, that the idea of becoming full-time revolutionaryterrorists seems to have occurred to them, partly through the logic ofnecessity.On 14 May 1970, Ulrike Meinhof walked into the German Institute for SocialQuestions. The librarian who opened the door told her it was closed thatmorning. Meinhof replied that she already knew this; she had been givenpermission to work with Andreas Baader on his book. Since she was a well-knownjournalist, the librarian took her word for it. Baader was brought in and hishandcuffs removed. Soon the doorbell rang again, and two young women entered,explaining that they needed to do some research. Moments later a masked manrushed into the room waving a gun; the two women produced guns from their bags,and in the gunfire that followed – mostly aimed at the floor – Baader andMeinhof leapt from a window and into an Alfa Romeo, driven by Thorwald Proll’ssister, Astrid. A librarian had been seriously wounded in the gunfire.Mahler now arranged for the group – which included Baader, Meinhof, Ensslin, andhimself – to escape from Germany to the Middle East, where they were trained interrorist tactics by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).It was at this point that they decided to call their movement the Red ArmyFaction, after the Japanese Red Army terrorist group.Back in Germany, Mahler organized bank raids to finance the movement. Mahlerhimself was arrested in October 1970. In May 1972 the RAF planted bombs at theheadquarters of the U.S. Fifth Army Corps in Frankfurt, killing a colonel andinjuring thirteen others. Damage was estimated at more than a million dollars.An anonymous phone call stated that the bombing was in retaliation for Vietnam.The following day suitcases containing time bombs exploded in the police stationin Augsburg, Bavaria, injuring five policemen. Three days later the wife of ajudge was injured by a car bomb in Karlsruhe. On 19 May, two time bombs explodedin the offices of the right-wing publishing house of Springer in Hamburg. And on25 May 1972, bomb explosions at the American army base in Heidelberg killedthree and injured five.Soon after the Heidelberg bombing, the Frankfurt police received a tip-off thatled them to the garage of an apartment building in the north of the city.Bomb-making equipment was seized and bombs defused. And when Andreas Baaderreached the garage in the early hours of 1 June 1972, driving a lilac Porsche,he was met by armed police. In the car with him were Jan-Carl Raspe and anotherterrorist, Holger Meins. Raspe opened fire and tried to escape but wasoverpowered. Baader and Meins shut themselves in the garage but were overcome bytear-gas grenades. Baader was shot in the thigh, and Meins emerged in hisunderpants, with his hands held high.Six days later Gudrun Ensslin was arrested in a Hamburg boutique – an assistanthad noticed a gun in her pocket and called the police.Ulrike Meinhof was arrested in Hanover a week later, as a result of a tip-offfrom a left-wing teacher who felt that the terrorists were harming the leftistcause. On 25 June a Briton named Ian MacLeod was shot and killed as police triedto arrest him in Stuttgart; he is believed to have been negotiating an arms dealfor the gang.The gang members were placed in Stuttgart’s top-security Stammheim Jail; thetrial would be delayed for another three years, until an escape-prooftop-security courtroom could be built. Meanwhile, evidence that the terroristthreat was as menacing as ever was provided at the Munich Olympics, when Arabterrorists from the Black September movement took nine Israeli athletes hostageand shot two more; the nine hostages died in a gun battle at the militaryairport, together with five terrorists. The terrorists’ demands had included therelease of the Baader-Meinhof gang.Terrorist outrages continued. In June 1974 an extremist named Ulrich Schmuckerwas executed by fellow gang members, accused of betraying a plot to blow up theTurkish embassy in Bonn in reprisal for the execution of three Turkishterrorists. And after the death by hunger strike of Holger Meins, on 9 November1974, a judge named Gunter von Drenckmann was shot down by flower-bearingterrorists when he answered the door on his birthday.Judges and leading industrialists were now forced to live in a state of siege.On 27 February 1975, terrorists seized Peter Lorenz, leader of the ChristianDemocratic Party, as he was being driven to his West Berlin office. The releaseof six terrorists was demanded in exchange for his life; these included HorstMahler but not, oddly enough, Baader or Meinhof. The West German governmentcaved in: five terrorists were released and flown out of Germany; perhaps sickof being on the run, Horst Mahler declined to accompany them. Lorenz was freedunharmed.The success of the escapade suggested that the next kidnapping would involve ademand for the release of the Baader-Meinhof gang. In fact, on 24 April 1975,six terrorists who called themselves the “Holger Meins commando” seized the WestGerman embassy in Stockholm and threatened a massacre of hostages unless theBaader-Meinhof gang was released and half a million dollars paid in ransom. Toemphasize their seriousness they shot to death the military attaché, Baron vonMirbach. The Bonn government refused to meet the terrorists’ demands but offeredthem safe passage out of the country in exchange for releasing the hostages.Before further negotiations could take place, there was a tremendous explosionon the top floor of the embassy – explosives placed in a refrigerator had beenset off accidentally. One terrorist was killed; the hostages made their way outof the building through the smoke. Five terrorists were caught as they tried toescape through a window. One of them died from the after-effects of theexplosion; the others were imprisoned in Germany.Finally, on 21 May 1975, the Baader-Meinhof trial began in a building that wasvirtually a fortress. Objections and harangues from the four defendants –Baader, Meinhof, Ensslin, and Raspe – threatened to reduce it to a farce. Butwhen, almost a year later, on 4 May 1976, Gudrun Ensslin claimed responsibilityfor three of the four bombings, it was all virtually over.Five days later, on 9 May Ulrike Meinhof was found hanging from her cell windowbars, her neck encircled by a noose made from her sheets. An autopsy led to averdict of suicide. But a second autopsy, carried out at her family’s behest,threw doubt on the verdict. Traces of semen were alleged to have been found onher underwear. Bruises on the inside of her thighs also suggested rape. A salivatrack ran from her breast to her navel, suggesting that she had been unclothedat the time of her death and had been dressed later. A group of medical expertslater agreed that throttling during rape could not be ruled out.The trial dragged on until April 1977, when the three remaining defendants eachwere given life plus fifteen years’ imprisonment. (Mahler had been sentenced tofourteen years for bank robbery in 1972.)Six months later, in October 1977, the Lufthansa airliner was hijacked at Palma,Majorca, and the last act of the drama began; it ended with the “suicides” ofBaader, Ensslin, and Raspe on 18 October. The German Left was quick to accusethe government of murder, and even the Right had to concede that it was highlylikely – in fact, that it was the only logical solution to the problem offurther attempts to free the gang.It looked as if one person now held the solution to the mystery: Irmgard Moller.If the others had been murdered, then clearly the killers had made a seriousmistake in leaving her alive. It seemed that she owed her life to the shortnessof the knife blade that had stabbed her but that had failed to reach her heart.But when Moller was able to speak, her testimony was disappointing. She broughtcriminal charges of murder against an “unknown person”, and in a hearing inJanuary 1978, denied that she had attempted suicide or that the four had beenable to communicate with one another during the Mogadishu hijacking. But she wasunable to describe how she came to be found unconscious – she could only recallhearing “two soft popping noises” and a voice saying, “Baader and Ensslin aredead already”. Her ninety-minute appearance ended when she was dragged out ofcourt as she tried to confer with her lawyers. In 1979 she was again sentencedto life imprisonment.Ingrid Schubert, one of the women who had helped free Baader in 1970, and whohad been jailed for her part in bank robberies, was found hanging in her cell on5 November 1977, three weeks after the deaths of Baader, Ensslin, and Raspe.Was the Baader-Meinhof gang “executed” by its captors? The Bonn governmentdenied it. There had, they insisted, been a suicide pact, whose aim was to fuelthe revolutionary fervor of the comrades outside. (Even during the trial therehad been another murder – of chief federal prosecutor Siegfried Bruback, on 7April 1977, and soon after the trial, on 30 July 1977, Jürgen Ponto was murderedby his own goddaughter, Susanne Albrecht.) A portable transistor radio had beendiscovered in the cell of Raspe, and the wires left in the walls of the gangmembers’ cells could have been used as a primitive signaling device. Explosivesfound in the cells were alleged to have been smuggled in to the gang members atthe same time as the pistols that had killed Baader and Raspe. The aim, said theofficial statement, had been to make suicide look like murder. Baader even wrotea letter to a Stuttgart court insisting that he would never commit suicide –although there was no particular need for this admission. Similarly, Ensslin hadsent for two clergymen and indicated that she thought she might be murdered. Allthis, like Moller’s accusation, could certainly be interpreted as evidence of aplot to embarrass the authorities with a final act of desperation and defiance.The evidence against this view is sparse yet highly disturbing: the semen stainson Ulrike Meinhof’s underwear; and the stab wounds – made with a blunt butterknife – in Irmgard Moller’s chest. One expert stated that there would be anoverwhelming inhibition against the self-infliction of such wounds.The irony of the Baader-Meinhof story is that nearly all the protagonists camefrom comfortable middle-class backgrounds and had little firsthand experience ofpoverty or injustice. If they had been living under Hitler or Stalin, it wouldbe easier to sympathize with the violence of their reactions. But in thedemocratic regime of West Germany, the argument that they were fighting “thegeneration of Auschwitz” sounds somehow exaggerated. One student leadercommented about Gudrun Ensslin’s “Auschwitz” speech: “She was too hysterical”.Andreas Baader, who had always been cynically nonpolitical, allowed Ensslin’shysteria to draw him into the fire-bombing. From then on, like some character inSophocles or Shakespeare, he was drawn into a whirlpool of events over which hehad no control and that made him the central figure in a grotesque tragedy thatinvolved the whole country. The verdict of history on the Baader-Meinhof orgy ofterrorism will probably be: It was all so unnecessary."},{"pageContent":"4 The Barbados VaultMystery of the Moving CoffinsOn 9 August 1812 the coffin of the Hon. Thomas Chase, a slave-owner on theCaribbean island of Barbados, was carried down the steps of the family vault. Asthe heavy slab was moved aside and the lamplight illuminated the interior, itbecame clear that something strange had happened. One of the three coffins italready contained was lying on its side. Another, that of a baby, was lying,head-downward, in a corner. It seemed obvious that the tomb had been desecrated.The odd thing was that there was no sign of forced entry. The coffins werereplaced in their original positions, and the tomb resealed. The local whitepopulation had no doubt that Negro labourers were responsible for the violation;Thomas Chase had been a cruel and ruthless man. In fact, the last coffin to belaid in the vault – only a month before Chase’s – was that of his daughter,Dorcas Chase, who was rumoured to have starved herself to death because of herfather’s brutality.Four years went by. On 25 September 1816 another small coffin – this time ofeleven-month-old Samuel Brewster Ames – was carried into the vault; once again,it was found in wild disorder. Someone had tumbled all four coffins about thefloor, including the immensely heavy lead-encased coffin of Thomas Chase, whichit had taken eight men to lift. Once more the coffins were arranged neatly, andthe vault resealed.It was opened again seven weeks later, this time to receive the body of SamuelBrewster, a man who had been murdered in a slave uprising the previous April,and who had been temporarily buried elsewhere in the meantime. Yet again thevault was in disorder, the coffins tumbled about in confusion. No one doubtedthat Negro slaves were responsible, and that this was an act of revenge. Themystery was: how had it been done? The great marble slab had been cemented intoplace each time, and there was no sign that it had been broken open and thenrecemented.One of the coffins – that of Mrs Thomasina Goddard, the first occupant of thevault – had disintegrated into planks, apparently as a result of its roughtreatment. They were tied together roughly with wire, and the coffin was placedagainst the wall. Since the vault (which was only 12 feet by 6½ feet) wasbecoming somewhat crowded, the children’s coffins were placed on top of those ofadults. Then once more the vault was resealed.The story had now become something of a sensation in the islands. Christ Church,and its rector, the Rev. Thomas Orderson, became the focus of unwelcomecuriosity. He showed understandable impatience with some of thesensation-seekers; but to those whose rank demanded politeness he explained thathe and a magistrate had made a careful search of the vault after the lastdesecration, trying to find how the vandals had got in. There was undoubtedly nosecret door; the floor, walls and curved ceiling were solid and uncracked. Hewas also convinced that the problem had not been caused by flooding. Althoughthe vault was two feet below ground-level, it had been excavated out of solidlimestone. And floods would have left some mark. Besides, it was unlikely thatheavy leaden coffins would float. Orderson naturally dismissed the theory heldby the local black population that the tomb had some kind of curse on it, andthat supernatural forces were responsible.By the time the next and last burial took place, there was universal interestand excitement. On 7 July 1819 (other accounts say the 17th), Mrs ThomazinaClarke was carried into the vault in a cedar coffin. The cement took a long timeto remove from the door – it had been used in abundance to reseal the vault –and even when it had been chipped away, the door still refused to yield.Considerable effort revealed that the massive leaden coffin of Thomas Chase wasnow jammed against it, six feet from where it had been placed. All the othercoffins were disturbed, with the exception of the wire-bound coffin of MrsGoddard. This seemed to prove that flooding was not the answer – would leadencoffins float when wooden planks lay unmoved?The governor, Lord Combermere, had been one of the first into the vault. He nowordered an exhaustive search. But it only verified what Orderson had saidearlier; there was no way that vandals could have forced their way into thevault, no hidden trapdoor, no entrance for floodwater. Before he ordered thetomb resealed, the governor ordered that the floor should be sprinkled withsand, which would show footprints. Then once more the door was cemented shut.Combermere even used his private seal on it so that it could not be opened andthen recemented without leaving obvious traces.Eight months later, on 18 April 1820, a party was gathered at Lord Combermere’sresidence, and conversation turned as it often did on the vault. Finally, thegovernor decided that they would go and investigate whether their precautionshad been effective. There were nine of them in all, including the governor, therector, and two masons. They verified that the cement was undisturbed and theseals intact. Then the masons opened the door. Once again the place was inchaos. A child’s coffin lay on the steps that led down into the chamber, whileThomas Chase’s coffin was upside down. Only Mrs Goddard’s bundle of planksremained undisturbed. The sand on the floor was still unmarked. Once again themasons struck the walls with their hammers, looking for a secret entrance. Andfinally, when it seemed obvious that the mystery was insoluble, Lord Combermereordered that the coffins should be removed and buried elsewhere. After that thetomb remained empty.None of the many writers on the case have been able to supply a plausibleexplanation. The obvious “natural” explanations are flooding and earth tremors.But flooding would have disarranged Mrs Goddard’s coffin and moved the sand onthe floor; besides, someone would have noticed if rain had been so heavy that itflooded the graveyard. The same applies to earth tremors strong enough to shakecoffins around like dice in a wooden cup. Conan Doyle suggested that theexplanation was some kind of explosion inside the vault, and to explain this hesuggests that the “effluvia” (sweat?) of the Negro slaves somehow combined withunnamed forces inside the vault to produce a gas explosion. Nothing seems lesslikely.Yet a “supernatural” explanation is just as implausible. It has often beenpointed out that the disturbances began after the burial of a woman believed tohave committed suicide; the suggestion is that the other “spirits” refused torest at ease with a suicide. But the movement of the coffins suggest apoltergeist (qv), and all the investigators are agreed that a poltergeist needssome kind of “energy source” – often an emotionally disturbed adolescent livingon the premises. And an empty tomb can provide no such energy source.The Negroes obviously believed there was some kind of voodoo at work – somemagical force deliberately conjured by a witch or witch doctor, the motive beingrevenge on the hated slave-owners. It sounds unlikely, but it is the best thatcan be offered."},{"pageContent":"5 The Basa MurderThe Voice from the GraveThere have been many folktales in which the dead have returned to give evidenceagainst their murderers; but there is only one example that has beenauthenticated beyond all shadow of a doubt. It is the case of a Filippinophysical therapist named Teresita Basa, who was stabbed to death in Chicago onFebruary 21, 1977.Toward 8:30 on the evening of that day, the Chicago fire department was calledto put out a blaze in a high-rise apartment building on the North Side. Two firefighters crawled into Apartment 15B through black smoke and saw that the firewas in the bedroom. A mattress lying at the foot of the bed was blazing. Withinminutes the firemen had put the blaze out and opened the windows to let out thesmoke. When they lifted the waterlogged mattress, they found the naked body of awoman, with her legs spread apart and a knife sticking out of her chest.Forty-eight-year-old Teresita Basa had been born in the city of Damaguete, inthe Philippines, the daughter of a judge. She had become a physical therapistspecializing in respiratory problems – perhaps because her father had died of arespiratory illness – and was working at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago at thetime of her death.Forensic examination postulated that Teresita had answered the door to someoneshe knew – she had been talking to a friend on the telephone when the doorbellrang. The intruder had encircled her neck from behind with his arm and chokedher until she lost consciousness. He then had taken money from her handbag andransacked the apartment. After that he had stripped off all her clothes, taken abutcher knife from the kitchen drawer, and driven it virtually through her body.Then he had set the mattress on fire with a piece of burning paper, dumped it ontop of her, and hurried out of the apartment. The fire alarm had sounded beforehe had gone more than a few blocks.Forensic investigation also revealed that there had been no sexual assault.Teresita Basa had died a virgin.Although Remy (short for Remibias) Chua, another Filippino, had worked withTeresita Basa in the respiratory therapy department of Edgewater Hospital, thetwo had been only slightly acquainted. Two weeks after the murder, during thecourse of a conversation, Chua remarked, only half seriously, “If there is nosolution to her murder, she can come to me in a dream”. She then went for abrief nap in the hospital locker room – it was two o’clock in the morning. Asshe was dozing on a chair, her feet propped on another, something made her openher eyes. She had to suppress a scream as she saw Teresita Basa – looking assolid as a living person – standing in front of her. She lost no time in runningout of the room.During the course of the next few weeks, two of Mrs Chua’s fellow employeesjokingly remarked that she looked – and behaved – like Teresita Basa. Herhusband, Dr José Chua, also noticed that his wife seemed to have undergone apersonality change. Normally sunny and good-natured, she had become oddlyperemptory and moody. Teresita Basa had also been prone to moods.In late July, five months after the murder, Remy Chua was working with ahospital orderly named Allan Showery when she found herself experiencing aninexplicable panic. Showery was a sinewy but powerfully built black man with anopen and confident manner. When Showery was standing behind Mrs Chua, she caughta movement out of the corner of her eye – just as Teresita Basa may have whenher killer stepped up behind her to lock his forearm round her neck – and,inexplicably, her heart began to pound violently. She decided that she wassuffering from nervous problems and asked for time off from work.That night her husband heard her talking in her sleep – she was repeating,“Al–Al–Al . . .” She told him later that she had dreamed of being in asmoke-filled room. The next day she felt so ill that she asked her parents tocome over. After taking a strong sedative, she climbed into bed. But after a fewhours’ sleep she began to babble in Spanish – a language Remy Chua did notspeak. Her husband knelt beside the bed and asked, “How are you”? His wifereplied, “I am Teresita Basa”. When José Chua asked what she wanted, the voicereplied, “I want help . . . Nothing has been done about the man who killed me”.A few minutes later “Teresita” disappeared and Remy Chua was herself again.Two days later Remy Chua felt a pain in her chest, followed by a heavysensation, “as if someone was stepping into her body”. She told her mother (whowas still with them), “Terrie is here again”.When her husband returned he found his wife in bed. The voice of Teresita Basaissued from her mouth, asking accusingly, “Did you talk to the police”? JoséChua acknowledged that he hadn’t, because he needed proof. “Allan killed me”insisted the voice. “I let Al into the apartment and he killed me”.The strain of Remy Chua’s “possession” was beginning to adversely affect thewhole family (the Chuas had four children). José Chua finally went to his bossat Franklin Park Hospital, Dr Winograd, and told him the whole story; DrWinograd took the “possession” seriously but believed that the police woulddismiss it as an absurdity. He advised Dr Chua to write them an anonymousletter.The “possessing entity” had other ideas. The next time Remy Chua went into atrancelike state, the voice demanded to know why José Chua had not done as sheasked. He explained that he had no proof. “Dr Chua”, said the voice, “the manAllan Showery stole my jewelry and gave it to his girlfriend. They livetogether”.“But how could it be identified”?“My cousins, Ron Somera and Ken Basa, could identify it. So could my friends,Richard Pessoti and Ray King”. She went on to give Dr Chua Ron Somera’stelephone number. After that she told him, “Al came to fix my television and hekilled me and burned me. Tell the police”.Dr Chua finally decided to do as she asked; he telephoned the Evanston policeheadquarters. On 8 August 1977, Investigator Joseph Stachula was assigned tointerview the Chuas. Their story left him stunned, yet he had an intuitivecertainty that they were not cranks. All the same, he could see no obvious wayto make use of what they had told him. He could hardly walk up to Allan Showeryand arrest him on the grounds that his victim had come back from the dead toaccuse him.A check on Showery revealed that he might well be the killer. He had a longcriminal record that included two rapes, each of which had taken place in thevictim’s apartment. Moreover, he had lived only four blocks from Teresita Basa.Showery was brought to the police station, and was asked if it were true that hehad agreed to repair Teresita Basa’s television on the evening of her murder. Heacknowledged that it was but insisted that he had gone to a local bar for adrink and simply forgotten. Asked if he had ever been in the Basa apartment, hedenied it. Then, when asked for fingerprint samples to compare with some foundin the apartment, he changed his mind and acknowledged that he had been theresome months earlier. Finally, he admitted that he had been there on the eveningof her death but claimed that he had left immediately because he did not have acircuit plan for that particular television.Now the suspect was obviously nervous, and the interviewers left him alone whilethey went back to talk to Yanka. She recalled that on the evening of the murder– she remembered it because the fire engine had passed her window – Showery hadcome home early. Asked by the interviewers if he had recently given her anyjewelry, she showed them an antique cocktail ring. She was asked to accompanythem back to the police station, together with her jewelry box. Meanwhile,Teresita Basa’s two friends, Richard Pessoti and Ray King, were brought to thestation. As soon as Pessoti glimpsed the ring on Yanka’s finger, he recognizedit as one belonging to Teresita Basa. The two were also able to identify otherjewelry in Yanka’s jewelry box.Stachula’s partner, Detective Lee Epplen, confronted Showery and told him, “It’sall over”. Showery screamed angrily, “You cops are trying to frame me”. Whenshown the jewelry, he insisted that he had bought it at a pawnshop but hadfailed to get a receipt. Minutes later he realized that the evidence against himwas overwhelming. He asked to speak to Yanka, and in the presence of thedetectives said, “Yanka, I have something to tell you. I killed Teresita Basa”.He had believed that Teresita was rich and that robbing her would solve all hisfinancial problems. But after killing her, he found that her purse containedonly thirty dollars. In order to make the murder look like a sex crime he hadundressed her and spread her legs apart. Then he had stabbed her with thebutcher knife and set the mattress on fire, hoping that the fire would destroyany clues he might have left behind.The “Voice from the Grave” case made national headlines. Showery came to trialon 21 January 1979, before Judge Frank W. Barbero. But the story of the“possession” of Remy Chua was so astounding that the jury was unable to agree ona verdict. The defense also objected that the evidence of a ghost was notadmissible in a court of law. Five days later a mistrial was declared. But on 23February 1979, Allan Showery acknowledged that he was guilty of the murder ofTeresita Basa. He was sentenced to fourteen years for murder and to four yearseach on charges of armed robbery and arson."},{"pageContent":"6 The Bermuda TriangleOn the afternoon of 5 December 1945 five Avenger torpedo-bombers took off fromFort Lauderdale, Florida, for a routine two-hour patrol over the Atlantic.Flight 19 was commanded by Flight Leader Charles Taylor; the other four pilotswere trainees, flying what is known as a “milk run” that is, a flight whosepurpose is simply to increase their number of hours in the air withoutinstructors. By 2.15 the planes were well over the Atlantic, and following theirusual patrol route. The weather was warm and clear.At 3.45 the control tower received a message from Taylor: “This is an emergency.We seem to be off course. We cannot see land . . . repeat . . . we cannot seeland”.“What is your position”?“We’re not sure of our position. We can’t be sure where we are. We seem to belost”.“Head due west”, replied the tower.“We don’t know which way is west. Everything is wrong . . . strange. We can’t besure of any direction. Even the ocean doesn’t look as it should”.The tower was perplexed; even if some kind of magnetic interference caused allfive compasses to malfunction, the pilot should still be able to see the sun lowin the western sky. Radio contact was now getting worse, restricting anymessages to short sentences. At one point the tower picked up one pilot speakingto another, saying that all the instruments in his plane were “going crazy”. Atfour o’clock the flight leader decided to hand over to someone else. At 4.25 thenew leader told the tower: “We’re not certain where we are”.Unless the planes could find their way back over land during the next fourhours, they would run out of fuel and be forced to land in the sea. At 6.27 arescue mission was launched. A giant Martin Mariner flying-boat, with a crew ofthirteen, took off towards the last reported position of the flight.Twenty-three minutes later, the sky to the east was lit briefly by a brightorange flash. Neither the Martin Mariner nor the five Avengers ever returned.They vanished completely, as other planes and ships have vanished in the areathat has become known as “the Devil’s Triangle” and “the Bermuda Triangle”.What finally happened to the missing aircraft is certainly no mystery. Theweather became worse during the course of that afternoon; ships reported “highwinds and tremendous seas”. Flight 19 and its would-be rescuer must have run outof fuel, and landed in the sea. The mystery is why they became so completelylost and confused. Even if the navigation instruments had ceased to function,and visibility had become restricted to a few yards, it should have beenpossible to fly up above the clouds to regain their bearings.What seems stranger still is that this tragedy should have failed to alert theauthorities that there was something frightening and dangerous about the stretchof ocean between Florida and the Bahamas – a chain of islands that begins a merefifty miles off the coast of Florida. But then the authorities no doubt took theview of many more recent sceptics, that the disappearance was a rather complexaccident, due to a number of chance factors: bad weather, electricalinterference with the compasses, the inexperience of some of the pilots and thefact that the flight leader, Charles Taylor, had only recently been posted toFort Lauderdale and was unfamiliar with the area.Similar explanations were adopted to explain a number of similar tragediesduring the next two decades: the disappearance of a Superfortress in 1947, of afour-engined Tudor IV in January 1948, of a DC3 in December 1948, of anotherTudor IV in 1949, of a Globemaster in 1950, of a British York transport plane in1952, of a Navy Super Constellation in 1954, of another Martin seaplane in 1956,of an Air Force tanker in 1962, of two Stratotankers in 1963, of a flying boxcarin 1965, of a civilian cargo plane in 1966, another cargo plane in 1967, and yetanother in 1973 . . . The total number of lives lost in all these disappearanceswas well in excess of two hundred. Oddly enough, the first person to realizethat all this amounted to a frightening mystery was a journalist called VincentGaddis; it was in February 1964 that his article “The Deadly Bermuda Triangle”appeared in the American Argosy magazine, and bestowed the now familiar name onthat mysterious stretch of ocean. A year later, in a book about sea mysteriescalled Invisible Horizons, Gaddis included his article in a chapter called “TheTriangle of Death”. His chapter also contained a long list of ships which hadvanished in the area, beginning with the Rosalie, which vanished in 1840, andending with the yacht Connemara IV in 1956. In the final chapter Gaddis enteredthe realm of science fiction, and speculated on “space-time continua [that] mayexist around us on the earth, interpenetrating our known world”, implying thatperhaps some of the missing planes and ships had vanished down a kind offourth-dimensional plughole.Soon after the publication of his book Gaddis received a letter from a mancalled Gerald Hawkes, who told of his own experience in the Bermuda Triangle inApril 1952. On a flight from Idlewild Airport (now Kennedy) to Bermuda, Hawkes’splane suddenly dropped about two hundred feet. This was not a nose-dive, butfelt if he had suddenly fallen down a lift-shaft in the air; then the plane shotback up again. “It was as if a giant hand was holding the plane and jerking itup and down”, and the wings seemed to flap like the wings of a bird. The captainthen told them that he was unable to find Bermuda, and that the operator wasunable to make radio contact with either the US or Bermuda. An hour or so laterthe plane made contact with a radio ship, and was able to get its bearings andfly to Bermuda. As they climbed out of the plane they observed that it was aclear and starry night, with no wind. The writer concluded that he was stillwondering whether he was caught in an area “where time and space seem todisappear”.Now, all pilots know about air pockets, where a sudden change in pressure causesthe plane to lurch and fall, and about air turbulence which causes the wings ofa plane to “flap”. What seems odd about this case is the total radio blackout.This was an anomaly that had also struck students of UFOS (see Chapter 39), orflying saucers, who had been creating extraordinary theories ever since that dayin June 1947 when a pilot named Kenneth Arnold saw nine shining discs movingagainst the background of Mount Rainier in Washington State. The flying-saucerenthusiasts now produced the interesting notion that the surface of our earthhas a number of strange “vortices”, whirlpools where gravity and terrestrialmagnetism are inexplicably weaker than usual. And if extra-terrestrialintelligences happened to know about these whirlpools, they might well find themideal for collecting human specimens to be studied at leisure upon their distantplanet . . .Ivan Sanderson, a friend of Gaddis’s and a student of earth mysteries, felt thatthis was going too far. His training had been scientific, so he began by takinga map of the world, and marking on it a number of areas where strangedisappearances had occurred. There was, for example, another “Devil’s Triangle”south of the Japanese island of Honshu where ships and planes had vanished. Acorrespondent told Sanderson about a strange experience on a flight to Guam, inthe western Pacific, when his ancient propeller-driven plane covered 340 milesin one hour, although there was no wind – about 200 miles more than it shouldhave covered; checks showed that many planes had vanished in this area.Marking these areas on the map, Sanderson observed that they were shaped likelozenges, and that these lozenges seemed to ring the globe in a neat symmetry,running in two rings, each between 30°C and 40°C north and south of the equator.There were ten of these “funny places”, about 72°C apart. An earthquakespecialist named George Rouse had argued that earthquakes originated in acertain layer below the earth’s surface, and had speculated that there was akind of trough running round the central core of the earth, which determined thedirection of seismic activities. Rouse’s map of these seismic disturbance areascorresponded closely with Sanderson’s “lozenges”. So Sanderson was inclined tobelieve that if “whirlpools” really caused the disappearance of ships andplanes, then they were perfectly normal physical whirlpools, caused, so tospeak, by the earth’s tendency to “burp”.Sanderson’s theory appeared in a book entitled Invisible Residents in 1970.Three years later a female journalist, Adi-Kent Thomas Jeffrey, tried to puttogether all the evidence about the Bermuda Triangle in a book of that name,printed by a small publishing company in Pennsylvania. It was undoubtedly herbad luck that her book failed to reach the general public. For one year laterCharles Berlitz, grandson of the man who founded the famous language schools,once again rehashed all the information about the Bermuda Triangle, persuaded acommercial publisher, Doubleday, to issue it, and promptly rocketed to the topof the American best-seller lists. It had been twenty years since thedisappearance of Flight 19, and ten years since Vincent Gaddis invented thephrase “Bermuda Triangle”. But Berlitz was the first man to turn the mysteryinto a worldwide sensation, and to become rich on the proceeds.Berlitz’s Bermuda Triangle, while highly readable, is low on scholarly precision– it does not even have an index. One reason for its popularity was that helaunched himself intrepidly into bizarre regions of speculation about UFOs,space-time warps, alien intelligences, chariots of the gods (à la Von Däniken)and other such matters. And among the weirdest of his speculations were thoseconcerning the pioneer “Ufologist” Morris K. Jessup, who had died in mysteriouscircumstances after stumbling upon information about a certain mysterious“Philadelphia experiment”. This experiment was supposed to have taken place inPhiladelphia in 1943, when the Navy was testing some new device whose purposewas to surround a ship with a powerful magnetic field. According to Jessup’sinformant, a hazy green light began to surround the vessel, so that its outlinesbecame blurred; then it vanished – to reappear in the harbour of Norfolk,Virginia, some three hundred miles away. Several members of the crew died;others went insane. According to Jessup, when he began to investigate thisstory, the Navy asked him whether he would be willing to work on a similarsecret project; he declined. In 1959 he was found dead in his car, suffocated byexhaust gas; Berlitz speculates that he was “silenced” before he could publicizehis discoveries about the experiment.And what has all this to do with the Bermuda Triangle? Simply that thePhiladelphia experiment was supposed to be an attempt to create a magneticvortex, like those suggested by Sanderson, and that (according to Jessup) it hadthe effect of involving the ship in a space-time warp that transported ithundreds of miles.Understandably, this kind of thing roused sceptics to a fury, and there weresuddenly a large number of articles, books and television programmes all devotedto debunking the Bermuda Triangle. These all adopted the common-sense approachthat had characterized the Naval authorities in 1945: that is to say, theyassumed that the disappearances were all due to natural causes, particularly tofreak storms. In many cases it is difficult not to agree that this is indeed themost plausible explanation. But when we look at the long list of disappearancesin the area, most of them never even yielding a body or a trace of wreckage, theexplanation begins to sound thin.Is there, then, an alternative which combines common sense with the boldnessnecessary to recognize that all the disappearances cannot be convenientlyexplained away? There is, and it rests on the evidence of some of those who haveescaped the Bermuda Triangle. In November 1964 a charter pilot named ChuckWakely was returning from Nassau to Miami, Florida, and had climbed up to 8,000feet. He noticed a faint glow round the wings of his plane, which he put down tosome optical illusion caused by cockpit lights. But the glow increased steadily,and all his electronic equipment began to go wrong. He was forced to operate thecraft manually. The glow became so blinding that he was dazzled; then slowly itfaded, and his instruments began to function normally again.In 1966 Captain Don Henry was steering his tug from Puerto Rico to FortLauderdale on a clear afternoon. He heard shouting, and hurried to the bridge.There he saw that the compass was spinning clockwise. A strange darkness camedown, and the horizon disappeared. “The water seemed to be coming from alldirections”. And although the electric generators were still running, allelectric power faded away. An auxiliary generator refused to start. The boatseemed to be surrounded by a kind of fog. Fortunately the engines were stillworking, and suddenly the boat emerged from the fog. To Henry’s amazement, thefog seemed to be concentrated into a single solid bank, and within this area thesea was turbulent; outside it was calm. Henry remarked that the compass behavedas it did on the St Lawrence River at Kingson, where some large deposit of iron– or a meteorite – affects the needle.Our earth is, of course, a gigantic magnet (no one quite knows why), and themagnetic lines of force run around its surface in strange patterns. Birds andanimals use these lines of force for “homing”, and water-diviners seem able torespond to them with their “dowsing rods”. But there are areas of the earth’ssurface where birds lose their way because the lines somehow cancel one anotherout, forming a magnetic anomaly or vortex. The Marine Observer for 1930 warnssailors about a magnetic disturbance in the neighbourhood of the Tamboravolcano, near Sumbawa, which deflected a ship’s compass by six points, leadingit off course. In 1932 Captain Scutt of the Australia observed a magneticdisturbance near Freemantle that deflected the compass 12° either side of theship’s course. Dozens of similar anomalies have been collected and documented byan American investigator, William Corliss, in books with titles like UnknownEarth and Strange Planet. It was Corliss who pointed out to me theinvestigations of Dr John de Laurier of Ottawa, who in 1974 went to camp on theice-floes of northern Canada in search of an enormous magnetic anomalyforty-three miles long, which he believes to originate about eighteen milesbelow the surface of the earth. De Laurier’s theory is that such anomalies aredue to the earth’s tectonic plates rubbing together – an occurrence that alsocauses earthquakes.The central point to emerge from all this is that our earth is not like anordinary bar magnet, whose field is symmetrical and precise; it is full ofmagnetic “pitfalls” and anomalies. Scientists are not sure why the earth has amagnetic field, but one theory suggests that it is due to movements in itsmolten iron core. Such movements would in fact produce shifting patterns in theearth’s field, and bursts of magnetic activity, which might be compared to thebursts of solar energy known as sunspots. If they are related to earth-tensionsand therefore to earthquakes then we would expect them to occur in certaindefinite zones, just as earthquakes do. What effects would a sudden “earthquake”of magnetic activity produce? One would be to cause compasses to spin, for itwould be rather as if a huge magnetic meteor was roaring up from the centre ofthe earth. On the sea it would produce an effect of violent turbulence, for itwould affect the water in the same way the moon affects the tides, but in anirregular pattern, so that the water would appear to be coming “from alldirections”. Clouds and mist would be sucked into the vortex, forming a “bank”in its immediate area. And electronic gadgetry would probably be put out ofaction . . .All this makes us aware why the “simplistic” explanations of the problem – allthose books explaining that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle is ajournalistic invention – are not only superficial but dangerous. They discouragethe investigation of what could be one of the most interesting scientificenigmas of our time. With satellites circling the earth at a height of 150miles, it should be possible to observe bursts of magnetic activity with thesame accuracy that earth tremors are recorded on seismographs. We should be ableto observe their frequency and intensity precisely enough to plot them inadvance. The result could not only be the solution of the mystery, but theprevention of future tragedies like that of Flight 19."},{"pageContent":"7 BigfootLike the gun-fight in OK Corral, the siege of Ape Canyon has become part ofAmerican folklore.It begins in 1924, when a group of miners were working in the Mount St Helen’srange in Washington State, seventy-five miles north of Portland, Oregon. One daythey saw a big ape-like creature peering out from behind a tree. One of theminers fired at it, and thought the bullet hit its head. The creature ran offinto the forest. Then another miner, Fred Beck – who was to tell the storythirty-four years later – met another of the “apes” at the canyon rim, and shotit in the back three times. It toppled over into the canyon; but when the minerswent to look there was no body.That night the miners found themselves under siege. From dusk until dawn thenext day the creatures pounded on the doors, walls and the roof, and rocks werehurled. The miners braced the heavy door from inside, and fired shots throughthe walls and roof. But the creatures were obviously angry and determined, andthe assault ceased only at sunrise. That day the miners decided to abandon thesite.Beck’s description of the “Bigfoot” is of a creature about eight feet tall, andvery muscular. It looked not unlike a gorilla, but if it could use rocks as aweapon of assault, then it was clearly humanoid.Fred Beck’s account of the siege, together with other sightings on the WestCoast, made Bigfoot something of a national celebrity in the late 1950s. Butstories about the creature had been in circulation for centuries. The SalishIndians of British Columbia called the creature “Sasquatch”, meaning “wild manof the woods”. In northern California the Huppa tribe call them “Oh-mah-ah”; inthe Cascades they are known as “Seeahtiks”.The notion of colonies of monsters living quietly in the modern US and Canadaadmittedly sounds absurd; but this is partly because few people grasp the sheersize of the North American coniferous forests – thousands of square miles oftotally uninhabited woodland, some still unexplored, where it would be possibleto hide a herd of dinosaurs.The first recorded story of a Sasquatch footprint dates back to 1811. Thewell-known explorer and trader David Thompson was crossing the Rockies towardsthe mouth of the Columbia river when, at the site of modern Jasper, Alberta, heand his companion came upon a footprint fourteen inches by eight inches, withfour toes and claw marks. Thompson thought it was probably a grizzly bear, buthis companion insisted that it could not have been a bear because bears havefive toes. In any case, few bears leave behind fourteen-inch footprints.The Daily Colonist of Victoria, British Columbia, for Friday, 4 July 1884,published an account of the capture of a Bigfoot. Jacko (as his captors calledhim) seems to have been a fairly small specimen, only 4 ft 7 in high, andweighing 127 pounds. He was spotted from a train which was winding its way alongthe Fraser river from Lytton to Yale, in the shadow of the Cascade mountains,and apparently captured without too much difficulty. He was described as havinglong black, coarse hair and short glossy hairs all over his body. The forearmswere much longer than a man’s, and were powerful enough to be able to tear abranch in two. Regrettably, Jacko’s subsequent fate is unknown, although thenaturalist John Napier reports that he may have been exhibited in Barnum andBailey’s Circus.In 1910 Bigfoot was blamed for a gruesome event that took place in the NahanniValley, near Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories. Two brothers namedMacLeod were found headless in the Valley, which subsequently became known asHeadless Valley. It seems far more likely that the prospectors were murdered byIndians or desperados; nevertheless, Bigfoot was blamed, and the legend acquireda touch of horror.In 1910 the Seattle Times contained a report about “mountain devils” whoattacked the shack of a prospector at Mount St Lawrence, near Kelso. Theattackers were described as half human and half monster, and between seven andeight feet tall. To the Clallam and Quinault Indians the creatures are known asSeeahtiks. Their legends declare that man was created from animals, and thatSeeahtiks were left in a half-finished state.One of the most remarkable Bigfoot stories dates from 1924, although it was notwritten down until 1957, when it was uncovered by John Green, author of On theTrack of the Sasquatch. Albert Ostman, a logger and construction worker, waslooking for gold at the head of the Toba Inlet in British Columbia, and wasunalarmed when an Indian boatman told him tales of “big people” living in themountains. After a week’s hiking he settled down in a campsite oppositeVancouver Island. But when he woke up in the morning he found that his supplieshad been disturbed. He decided to stay awake that night, so when he climbed intohis sleeping-bag he removed only his boots; he also took his rifle into thesleeping-bag with him. Hours later, he reported, “I was awakened by somethingpicking me up. I was asleep and at first I did not remember where I was. As Ibegan to get my wits together, I remembered I was on this prospecting trip, andin my sleeping-bag”.Hours later, his captor dumped him down on the ground, and he was able to crawlout of the sleeping-bag. He found himself in the presence of a family of fourSasquatches – a father eight feet tall, a mother and teenage son and immaturedaughter. Ostman described them in considerable detail – the woman was overseven feet tall, between forty and seventy years of age, and weighed between 500and 600 pounds. They apparently made no attempt to hurt him, but seemeddetermined not to let him go. Possibly they regarded him as a future husband forthe girl, who was small and flat-chested. He spent six days in their companyuntil, choosing his moment, he fired off his rifle. While his captors dived forcover, Ostman escaped. Asked by John Green why he had kept silent for so long,Ostman explained that he thought nobody would believe him.In 1928 an Indian of the Nootka tribe called Muchalat Harry arrived at Nootka,on Vancouver Island, clad only in torn underwear, and still badly shaken. Heexplained that he had been making his way to the Conuma river to do some huntingand fishing when, like Ostman, he was picked up – complete with sleeping bag –and carried several miles by a Bigfoot. At daybreak he found himself in themidst of a group of about twenty of the creatures, and was at first convincedthey intended to eat him. When one of them tugged at his underwear it wasobviously astonished that it was loose – assuming it to be his skin. He satmotionless for hours, and by afternoon they had lost interest and went offlooking for food. Harry took the opportunity to escape, and ran a dozen or somiles to where he’d hidden his canoe, then paddled another forty-five miles backto Vancouver Island, where he told this story to Father Anthony Terhaar, of theBenedictine Mission. Terhaar says that Harry was in such a state of nervouscollapse that he needed to be nursed carefully back to health, and that his hairbecame white. The experience shook him so much that he never again left thevillage.In 1967 a logger called Glenn Thomas from Estacada, Oregon, was walking down apath at Tarzan Springs near the Round Mountain when he saw three big hairyfigures pulling rocks out of the ground, then digging down six or seven feet.The male figure took out a nest of rodents and ate them. Investigators lookinginto his story found thirty or forty holes, from which rocks weighing as much astwo hundredweight had been shifted. Chucks and marmots often hibernate undersuch rocks, and there were many of these animals in the area.By that time one of the most convincing pieces of evidence for the existence ofBigfoot had emerged. In October 1967 two young men called Roger Patterson andBob Gimlin were in Bluff Creek in Del Norte country, northern California, whenthey were thrown from their horses as they rounded the bend in the Creek. Abouta hundred feet ahead, on the other side of the Creek bed, there was a huge,hairy creature that walked like a man. Roger Patterson grabbed his ciné-camera,and started filming. The creature – which they had by now decided was a female –stopped dead, then looked around at them. “She wasn’t scared a bit. The fact is,I don’t think she was scared of me, and the only thing I can think of is thatthe clicking of my camera was new to her”. As Patterson tried to follow her thecreature suddenly began to run, and after three and a half miles they lost hertracks on pine needles.The film – which has become famous – shows a creature about seven feet high,weighing around 350 to 450 pounds, with reddish-brown hair and prominent furrybreasts and buttocks. As it strides past it turns its head and looks straightinto the camera, revealing a fur-covered face. The top of the head is conical inshape. Both mountain gorillas and Bigfoot’s cousin the Yeti or AbominableSnowman (of which more in a moment) display this feature. According tozoologists, its purpose is to give more anchorage to the jaw muscles to aid inbreaking tough plants.Inevitably, there were many scientists who dismissed the film as a hoax,claiming that the creature was a man dressed in a monkey suit. But in his bookMore “Things” the zoologist Ivan Sanderson quotes three scientists, Dr OsmanHill, Dr John Napier and Dr Joseph Raight, all of whom seem to agree that thereis nothing in the film that leads them, on scientific grounds, to suspect ahoax. Casts taken of the footprints in the mud of the Creek indicate a creatureroughly seven feet high.The Asian version of Bigfoot is a Yeti, better known as the Abominable Snowman.When Eric Shipton, the Everest explorer, was crossing the Menlung Glacier onEverest in 1951 he observed a line of huge footprints; Shipton photographed oneof them, with an ice axe beside it to provide scale. It was eighteen inches longand thirteen inches wide, and its shape was curious – three small toes and ahuge big toe that seemed to be almost circular. The footsteps were those of atwo-legged creature, not a wolf or a bear. The only animal with a vaguelysimilar foot is an orang-utan. But they have a far longer big toe.Ever since European travellers began to explore Tibet they had reported legendsof a huge ape-like creature called the Metoh-kangmi, which translates roughly asthe filthy or abominable snowman. The stories cover a huge area, from theCaucasus to the Himalayas, from the Pamirs, through Mongolia, to the far easterntip of Russia. In central Asia they are called Mehteh, or Yetis, while tribes ofeastern Asia refer to them as Almas. The earliest reference to them in the Westseems to be a report in 1832 by B.H. Hodgson, the British Resident at the Courtof Nepal, who mentioned that his native hunters were frightened by a “wild man”covered in long dark hair. More than half a century later, in 1889, Major L.A.Waddell was exploring the Himalayas when he came across huge footprints in thesnow at 17,000 feet; his bearers told him that these were the tracks of a Yeti.And the Yeti, according to the bearers, was a ferocious creature which was quitelikely to attack human beings and carry them off for food. The best way toescape it was to run downhill, for the Yeti had such long hair that it wouldfall over its eyes and blind it when it was going downhill.In 1921 an expedition led by Colonel Howard-Bury, making a first attempt on thenorth face of Everest, saw in the distance a number of large dark creaturesmoving against the snow of the Lhapta-la Pass; the Tibetan porters said thesewere Yetis. And in 1925 N.A. Tombazi, a Fellow of the Royal GeographicalSociety, almost managed to get a photograph of a naked, upright creature on theZemu Glacier; but it had vanished by the time he sighted the camera. And so thelegends and the sightings continued to leak back to civilization, always withthat slight element of doubt which made it possible for scientists to dismissthem as lies or mistakes. Shipton’s photograph of 1951 caused such a sensationbecause it was taken by a member of a scientific expedition who could have nopossible motive for stretching the facts. Besides, the photograph spoke for him.At least, so one might assume. The Natural History Department of the BritishMuseum did not agree, and one of its leading authorities, DrT.C.S.Morrison-Scott, was soon committing himself to the view that the footprintwas made by a creature called the Himalayan langur. His assessment was based ona description of the Yeti by Sherpa Tensing, who said it was about five feethigh, walked upright, had a conical skull and reddish-brown fur. This, said DrMorrison-Scott, sounded quite like a langur. The objection to this was that thelangur, like most apes, walks on all fours most of the time; besides, its feethave five very long toes, quite unlike the four rounded toes of the photograph.Morrison-Scott’s theory was greeted with hoots of disdain, as it undoubtedlydeserved to be. But that brought the identification of the strange creature nocloser.A more imaginative view was taken by the Dutch zoologist Bernard Huevelmans in aseries of articles published in Paris in 1952. He pointed out that in 1934 DrRalph von Koenigwald had discovered some ancient teeth in the shop of a Chineseapothecary in Hong Kong – the Chinese regard powdered teeth as a medicine. Oneof these was a human-type molar which was twice as large as the molar of anadult gorilla, suggesting that its owner had stood about twelve feet tall.Evidence suggested that this giant – he became known as Gigantopithecus – livedaround half a million years ago. Huevelmans suggested that Shipton’s footprintswere made by a huge biped related to Gigantopithecus. But few scientistsconsidered his theory seriously.In 1954 the Daily Mail sent out an expedition to try to capture (or at leastphotograph) a Yeti. It spent fifteen weeks plodding through the Himalayan snowswithout so much as a glimpse of the filthy snowman. But the expedition gatheredone exciting piece of information. Several monasteries, they learned, possessed“Yeti scalps”, which were revered as holy relics. Several of these scalps weretracked down, and proved to be fascinating. They were all long and conical,rather like a bishop’s mitre, and covered with hair, including a “crest” in themiddle, made of erect hair. One of these scalps proved to be a fake, sewntogether from fragments of animal skin. But others were undoubtedly made of onepiece of skin. Hairs from them were sent to experts for analysis, and theexperts declared that they came from no known animal. It looked as if theexistence of the Yeti had finally been proved. Alas, it was not to be.Sir Edmund Hillary was allowed to borrow one of the scalps – he was held in veryhigh regard in Tibet – and Bernard Huevelmans had the opportunity to examine it.It reminded him of a creature called the southern serow, a kind of goat, whichhe had seen in a zoo before the war. And serows exist in Nepal, “abominablesnowman” country. Huevelmans tracked down a serow in the Royal Institute inBrussels. And comparison with the Yeti scalp revealed that it came from the sameanimal. The skin had been stretched and moulded with steam. It was not, ofcourse, a deliberate fake. It was made to be worn in certain religious ritualsin Tibet; over the years its origin had been forgotten, and it had beendesignated a Yeti scalp.All this was enough to convince the sceptics that the Yeti was merely a legend.But that conclusion was premature. Europeans who went out searching for thesnowman might or might not catch a glimpse of some dark creature moving againstthe snow. But their tracks were observed, and photographed, in abundance. AFrenchman, the Abbè Bordet, followed three separate lots of tracks in 1955.Squadron Leader Lester Davies filmed huge footprints in the same year. ClimberDon Whillans saw an ape-like creature on Annapurna in June 1970, and Lord Huntphotographed more Yeti tracks in 1978.In Russia more solid evidence began to emerge. In 1958 Lt Col Vargen Karapetyansaw an article on the Yeti – or, as it is known in Russia, Alma – in a Moscownewspaper, and sought out the leading Soviet expert, Professor Boris Porshnev,to tell him his own story. In December 1941 his unit had been fighting theGermans in the Caucasus near Buinakst, and he was approached by a unit ofpartisans and asked to go and look at a man they had taken prisoner. Thepartisans explained that Karapetyan would have to go along to a barn to look atthe “man”, because as soon as he was taken into a heated room, he stank anddripped sweat; besides, he was covered in lice. The “man” proved to be more likean ape: naked, filthy and unkempt, he looked dull and vacant, and often blinked.He made no attempt to defend himself when Karapetyan pulled out hairs from hisbody, but his eyes looked as if he was begging for mercy. It was obvious that hedid not understand speech. Finally, Karapetyan left, telling the partisans tomake up their own minds about what to do with the creature. He heard a few dayslater that the “wild man” had escaped. Obviously this story could have been aninvention. But a report from the Ministry of the Interior in Daghestan confirmedits truth. The “wild man” had been court-martialled and executed as a deserter.It was in January 1958 that Dr Alexander Pronin, of Leningrad University,reported seeing an Alma. He was in the Pamirs, and saw the creature outlinedagainst a cliff-top. It was man-like, covered with reddish-grey hair, and hewatched it for more than five minutes; three days later he saw it again at thesame spot. For some reason good Marxists poured scorn on the notion of a “wildman”; but the evidence went on accumulating, until Boris Porshnev began to makean attempt to co-ordinate the sightings. The considerable body of evidence hehas accumulated is described in some detail in Odette Tchernine’s impressivebook The Yeti.To summarize: the evidence for the existence of the Yeti, or Alma, or Bigfoot,or Sasquatch, is very strong indeed; hundreds of sightings make it unlikely thatit is an invention. If, then, we assume for a moment that it really exists, whatis it?Dr Myra Shackley, lecturer in archaeology at Leicester University, believes sheknows the answer. She is convinced that the Yeti is a Neanderthal man. And thisis also the conclusion reached by Odette Tchernine on the basis of the Sovietevidence.Neanderthal man was the predecessor of modern man. He first seems to haveappeared on earth about a hundred thousand years ago. He was smaller and moreape-like than modern man, with the well-known receding forehead and simian jaw.He lived in caves, and the piles of animal bones discovered in such cavessuggest that Neanderthal woman was a sluttish housewife, and that his habitationmust have stunk of rotting flesh. He was also a cannibal. But he was by no meansa mere animal. Colouring pigments in Neanderthal caves suggest that he lovedcolour; he certainly wove screens of coloured flowers. And since he buried thesewith his dead, it seems certain that he believed in an afterlife. Mysteriousround stones found in his habitations suggest that he was a sun-worshipper.Our ancestor, Cro-Magnon man, came on earth about fifty thousand years ago; itwas he who made all the famous cave paintings. Neanderthal man vanishedcompletely over the next twenty thousand years, and the mystery of hisdisappearance has never been solved. The general view is that he wasexterminated by Cro-Magnon man (William Golding’s novel The Inheritors is astory of the encounter between the two; so is H.G. Wells’s earlier The GrislyMen).The psychologist Stan Gooch advanced a startling thesis in his book TheNeanderthal Question: that Neanderthals were not entirely exterminated, but thattheir women occasionally bore children to Cro-Magnon males. The descendants ofthese products of cross-breeding became the Jews. (It should be noted that Goochis himself Jewish.) Gooch believes that Neanderthal man was more “psychic” thanCro-Magnon, and that such psychic faculties as present-day man now possesses areinherited from these Neanderthal ancestors.Whether or not we can accept Gooch’s theory, it seems reasonable to suppose thatNeanderthal man may have survived, driven into the wilder and less hospitableplaces of the earth by his conqueror. Myra Shackley has travelled to the Altaimountains of Mongolia and collected evidence for the existence of Almas. “Theylive in caves, hunt for food, use stone tools, and wear animal skins and fur”.And she mentions that in 1972 a Russian doctor met a family of Almas. In fact,Odette Tchernine cites a number of such stories. Professor Porshnev discoveredagain and again evidence among mountain people that they knew of the existenceof “wild men”; the Abkhazians still have stories of how they drove the wild menout of the district they colonized. Tchernine refers to these wild men as“pre-hominids”.Porshnev himself investigated a case of a female Alma who had been caught in theOchamchir region in the mid-nineteenth century. Hunters captured a “wild woman”who had ape-like features and was covered in hair; for several years incaptivity she was so violent that she could not be approached, and food had tobe thrown to her. They called her Zana. Porshnev interviewed many old people –one was a hundred and five – who remembered Zana. They told him how she hadbecome domesticated, and would perform simple tasks like grinding corn. She hada massive bosom, thick muscular arms and legs, and thick fingers; she could notendure warm rooms but preferred the cold. She loved to gorge herself on grapesin the vineyard, and also enjoyed wine – she would drink heavily, then sleep forhours. This may explain how she became a mother on several occasions, todifferent fathers. Her children usually died because she washed them in thefreezing river. (Presumably, having half-human characteristics, they lacked hertremendous inherited endurance of cold.) Finally, her newborn children weretaken away from her, and they grew up among the people of the village. Unliketheir mother, they could talk and were reasonable human beings. The youngest ofthese died as recently as 1954 (Zana died about 1890). Porshnev interviewed twoof her grandchildren, and noted their dark skin and Negroid looks. Shalikula,the grandson, had such powerful jaws that he could pick up a chair with a mansitting on it. Here, it would seem, is solid, undeniable evidence of theexistence of “wild men”."},{"pageContent":"8 Christie, AgathaThe disappearance of the novelistIn 1926 Agatha Christie was involved in a mystery that sounds like the plot ofone of her own novels. But unlike the fictional crimes unravelled by HerculePoirot, this puzzle has never been satisfactorily solved.At the age of thirty-six, Agatha Christie seemed an enviable figure. She was anattractive redhead, with a touch of grey, and lived with her husband, ColonelArchibald Christie, in a magnificent country house which she once described as“a sort of millionaire-style Savoy suite transferred to the country”.She was also the author of seven volumes of detective fiction, of which thelatest, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, had caused some controversy because of its“unfair” ending. Yet the authoress was hardly a celebrity; few of her booksachieved sales of more than a few thousand.Then on the freezing cold night of 3 December 1926 she left her home atSunningdale, in Berkshire, and disappeared.At eleven the next morning, a Superintendent in Surrey Police was handed areport on a “road accident” at Newlands Corner, just outside Guildford. AgathaChristie’s Morris two-seater had been found halfway down a grassy bank with itsbonnet buried in a clump of bushes. There was no sign of the driver, but she hadclearly not intended to go far, because she had left her fur coat in the car.By mid-afternoon the Press had heard of the disappearance, and were besiegingthe Christie household. From the start the police hinted that they suspectedsuicide. Her husband dismissed this theory, sensibly pointing out that mostpeople commit suicide at home, and do not drive off in the middle of the night.But an extensive search of the area around Newlands Corner was organized and theSilent Pool, an allegedly bottomless lake in the vicinity, was investigated bydeep-sea divers.What nobody knew was that Agatha Christie’s life was not as enviable as itlooked. Her husband had recently fallen in love with a girl who was ten yearshis junior – Nancy Neele – and had only recently told her that he wanted adivorce. The death of her mother had been another psychological shock. She wassleeping badly, eating erratic meals, and moving furniture around the house in ahaphazard manner. She was obviously distraught, possibly on the verge of anervous breakdown.The next two or three days produced no clues to her whereabouts. When it wasreported that some female clothes had been found in a lonely hut near NewlandsCorner, together with a bottle labelled “opium”, there was a stampede ofjournalists. But it proved to be a false alarm, and the opium turned out to be aharmless stomach remedy. Some newspapers hinted that Archibald Christie stood togain much from the death of his wife, but he had a perfect alibi: he was at aweekend party in Surrey. Other journalists began to wonder whether thedisappearance was a publicity stunt. Ritchie-Calder suspected that she haddisappeared to spite her husband, and bring his affair with Nancy Neele out intothe open. He even read through her novels to see whether she had ever used asimilar scenario. When the Daily News offered a reward reports of sightingspoured in. They all proved to be false alarms.Another interesting touch of mystery was added when her brother-in-law Campbellrevealed that he had received a letter from her whose postmark indicated that ithad been posted in London at 9.45 on the day after her disappearance, when shewas presumably wandering around in the woods of Surrey.In the Mail the following Sunday there was an interview with her husband inwhich he admitted “that my wife had discussed the possibility of disappearing atwill. Some time ago she told her sister, ‘I could disappear if I wished and setabout it carefully . . .’” It began to look as if the disappearance, after all,might not be a matter of suicide or amnesia.On 14 December, eleven days after her disappearance, the head waiter in theHydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, looked more closely at a femaleguest and recognized her from newspaper photographs as the missing novelist. Herang the Yorkshire police, who contacted her home. Colonel Christie took anafternoon train from London to Harrogate, and learned that his wife had beenstaying in the hotel for a week and a half. She had taken a good room on thefirst floor at seven guineas a week, and had apparently seemed “normal andhappy”, and “sang, danced, played billiards, read the newspaper reports of thedisappearance, chatted with her fellow guests, and went for walks”.Agatha made her way to the dinner table, picked up an evening paper whichcontained the story of the search for herself, together with a photograph, andwas reading it when her husband made his way over to her. “She only seemed toregard him as an acquaintance whose identity she could not quite fix”, said thehotel’s manager. And Archibald Christie told the Press: “She has suffered fromthe most complete loss of memory and I do not think she knows who she is”. Adoctor later confirmed that she was suffering from loss of memory. But LordRitchie-Calder later remembered how little she seemed to correspond with theusual condition of amnesia. When she vanished, she had been wearing a greenknitted skirt, a grey cardigan and a velour hat, and carried a few pounds in herpurse. When she was found she was stylishly dressed, and had three hundredpounds on her. She had told other guests in the hotel that she was a visitorfrom South Africa.There were unpleasant repercussions. A public outcry, orchestrated by the Press,wanted to know who was to pay the £3,000 which the search was estimated to havecost, and Surrey ratepayers blamed the next big increase on her. Her next novel,The Big Four, received unfriendly reviews, but nevertheless sold nine thousandcopies – more than twice as many as The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. And from thenon (as Elizabeth Walter has described in an essay called “The Case of theEscalating Sales”) her books sold in increasing quantities. By 1950 all herbooks were enjoying a regular sale of more than fifty thousand copies, and thefinal Miss Marple story, Sleeping Murder, had a first printing of sixtythousand.Agatha Christie divorced her husband (who wed Miss Neele) and in 1930 marriedProfessor Sir Max Mallowan. But for the rest of her life she refused to discussher disappearance, and would only grant interviews on condition that it was notmentioned. Her biographer, Janet Morgan, accepts that it was a case of nervousbreakdown, followed by amnesia. Yet this is difficult to accept. Where did sheobtain the clothes and the money to go to Harrogate? Why did she register underthe surname of her husband’s mistress? And is it possible to believe that heramnesia was so complete that, while behaving perfectly normally, she was able toread accounts of her own disappearance, look at photographs of herself, andstill not even suspect her identity?Lord Ritchie-Calder, who got to know her very well in later life, remainsconvinced that “her disappearance was calculated in the classic style of herdetective stories”. A television play produced after her death even speculatedthat the disappearance was part of a plot to murder Nancy Neele. The only thingthat is certain about “the case of the disappearing authoress” is that it turnedAgatha Christie into a bestseller, and eventually into a millionairess.Postscript to “The Disappearance of Agatha Christie” The mystery of Agatha Christie’s disappearance was finally solved after herdeath on 12 January 1976. Then it was clear why it had been kept secret – thetruth would have been highly embarrassing to the writer and her family.Ritchie Calder had been right all along; the disappearance had been staged withthe connivance of her sister-in-law Nan, and the motive was simply to spite herhusband and to spoil the weekend he had meant to spend with his mistress. WhatAgatha Christie had not reckoned with was the immense public interest that herdisappearance would generate. The subsequent publicity appalled her – eventhough it also had the effect of turning her into a celebrity and a bestsellingauthor – and she had no wish to confess that the reason for the disappearancewas that her husband had a mistress.The root of Agatha Christie’s problems almost certainly lay in her childhood.She was a highly imaginative and very private person. When a toddler she washorrified to overhear her nanny tell a housemaid that Miss Agatha had beenplaying again with her imaginary friends, the Kittens. Her lifelong dislike ofinvasions of her privacy seems to have begun there.Agatha Christie was born on 15 September 1890, in a white villa called Ashfield,on the outskirts of Torquay, the seaside resort on the south coast of Devon. Herfather, Frederick Miller, was a wealthy American and he and his wife Clarissahad three children, of whom Agatha was the third. Her elder sister Madge wasregarded as the clever one of the family. It was her father’s devotion to Madgethat was to cause tragedy. He spent so much money on her coming-out in New Yorkthat the family’s finances became straitened. For the first time in his life hebegan to think of taking some kind of a job in the City. But he had noqualifications, and a combination of depression and a chill that turned intodouble pneumonia killed him when Agatha was eleven.For a while, it looked as if Clarissa Miller would have to sell Ashfield, but bymeans of extreme economies she managed to hang on to it, to Agatha’s enormousrelief. But the change from affluence to poverty was traumatic for the child andwas – at least partly – responsible for that determination to hang on to hermoney that led to the eventual break-up of her marriage.In the year following her father’s death, Madge married James Watts, the son ofa wealthy Manchester manufacturer, and the bridegroom’s younger sister Nan wasto become Agatha’s lifelong friend and coconspirator.It was Agatha’s regular visits to the magnificent Victorian Gothic home of JamesWatt Senior, Abney Hall in Cheshire, that provided her with the kind ofexperience of high living that she was to use so effectively in her detectivenovels.As a teenager, with her long red-blonde hair and shy manner, Agatha was highlyattractive and she quickly became involved with a young man she met at amateurtheatricals in Torquay. But they drifted apart when she went to a finishingschool in Paris where she took singing and piano lessons. Her sister-in-law Nanwas at this time at a finishing school in Florence, and Agatha frequentlyvisited her there. She also made her first acquaintance with Egypt when she hadher coming-out season in Cairo. And in 1912, when she was twenty-two, she mether future husband, Archibald Christie, at a dance given by Lord and LadyClifford at their home in Devon. He was tall, handsome, and had learnedsoldiering at the Royal Woolwich Military Academy, after which he became alieutenant, stationed at Exeter.The hero-worshipping Agatha was swept off her feet. Archie wanted to marry herimmediately, but Agatha’s mother objected – there was something about Archie,perhaps a touch of selfishness or irresponsibility, that made her suspicious.But eighteen months later, the First World War broke out, and Archie and Agathamarried when he was home on leave.Archie went to serve his country in France, and his wife returned home to livewith her mother. But Agatha also decided to join in the war effort and became avoluntary nurse at the Red Cross hospital in Torquay. To take her mind off thewar, she began to devour detective stories.Her elder sister Madge had become a published writer, whose stories oftenappeared in Vanity Fair and other magazines. Agatha had also been writing foryears, but her stories had invariably been rejected. But it was a bet with hersister that she could write a good detective novel that led Agatha to write TheMysterious Affair at Styles, whose hero was a Belgian because at that timeTorquay happened to be full of Belgian refugees. As might have been expected,the murder in the novel was committed by poison – a subject upon which Agathawas to become increasingly knowledgable.The war came to an end, Archie returned home, and husband and wife moved toLondon where Archie was working for the Air Ministry. Their finances werestraitened, so much so that it took Agatha many weeks to decide to call on herold friend Nan, who had acquired herself a wealthy husband. The two found theyenjoyed being together just as much as they had in childhood. In 1919, Agathagave birth to a daughter, Clanssa.Meanwhile, Agatha had decided that it would improve their finances if she couldfind a publisher for The Mysterious Affair at Styles. In 1920, it was acceptedby John Lane of the Bodley Head, who was so confident of her ability to writethat he gave her a contract for five books. The book was published in Englandand America and sold two thousand copies. All Agatha made from it was £25.As it became clear to Agatha that her publishers were taking advantage of her,she determined to break with them as soon as possible.Archie had joined the staff of the Imperial and Foreign Corporation, and in1922, when he became Financial Advisor on the British Empire Mission, they wenton a world tour which included South Africa, Australia and the United States.But when they got back from the tour, Archie suddenly found that he had beenmade redundant. Agatha’s detective stories now became doubly important to theirfinances. Archie hated being redundant, and the marriage began to show signs ofstrain. Things did not improve when a series of Poirot stories appeared in TheSketch, and Agatha was described as the “writer of the most brilliant detectivenovel of the day”. And although Archie soon found himself a job, his feelingthat his wife was the family’s main provider continued to rankle.When the five book contract with The Bodley Head came to an end, Agatha turneddown an offer to renew it on better terms, and moved to Collins, who offered heran advance of £200 on each novel – an impressive sum for those days.When Agatha refused to share her literary earnings with her husband, Archiebecame even more resentful. Busy with her career, his wife failed to notice thewarning signs. She was probably rather relieved when Archie became a golfenthusiast, for it kept him occupied. But it was on the golf course that Archiemet a typist named Nancy Neele, and fell in love with her.On holiday with her husband in France, Agatha noticed that he seemed moody andirritable but had no idea that this was because he had transferred hisaffections elsewhere. In fact, she knew Nancy Neele well, and the girl oftenspent weekends with them. She had no suspicion that Nancy was her husband’smistress.So far, the name Agatha Christie had become known only to readers of detectivestories, and she seldom made more than a few hundred pounds from each book. Butin 1925, the serialisation of Who Killed Roger Ackroyd? brought her a new levelof celebrity, as critics squabbled about whether it was not cheating to make thekiller the harmless Watson who tells the story. It became her most successfulbook to-date.The Christies had moved by now into a large house not far from Sunningdale, inBerkshire, and had decided to call it Styles, after Agatha’s first book. Thatwas hardly auspicious, since the fictional Styles had been the scene of amurder. In fact, the real Styles had a bad reputation as the last three ownershad all encountered disasters. But Agatha felt no misgivings. She was cheerfuland full of confidence, her marriage seemed happy, and she even tried topersuade Archie that it was time to have another baby.In April 1926, Agatha was shattered when her mother died after a bout ofbronchitis. She was on her way to see her when she suddenly had a strongconviction that her mother was already dead.Her intuition was to manifest itself again a few months later when Archie cameback from a trip abroad and Agatha had a strong feeling that there was somethingwrong. She pressed him to tell her – and then was horrified when he admittedthat he was in love with Nancy Neele and that she had been his mistress for thepast eighteen months. Agatha felt totally betrayed. For a while, Archie moved toLondon, living at his club, and Agatha sank into a depression. Finally, whenArchie confessed that he was not quite sure whether they should divorce, shepressed him to keep their marriage going on a trial basis for another year.Archie would only agree to three months. Agatha got a little of her own back bywriting a story in which the “other woman” commits suicide by jumping off acliff. But Nancy was disinclined to do anything so convenient.And so came that evening on 3 December 1926, when she walked out of Styles anddisappeared – and became known to every newspaper-reader in England.In fact, she and Archie had quarrelled violently that morning because Archieintended to go and stay the weekend with friends, and Nancy Neele would also bea guest. When Archie left for London, Agatha wrote him a long letter full ofrecriminations. After that, she left the house at about 10 p.m, drove toNewlands Corner and put her prearranged plan into operation. She parked on theedge of the road and then pushed the car down the slope, with its headlightsfull on. She left her fur coat and a case of her clothes – as well as herdriving license – in the car. It had stopped in a clump of bushes on the edge ofa chalk pit. After that, Agatha walked to West Clandon Station and took a trainto London. There she went along to the home of her sister-in-law Nan, at 78Chelsea Park Gardens, and stayed there the night. She had been to see Nan a fewdays before to tell her about her husband’s betrayal, so the visit was notwholly unexpected.The next morning, Agatha posted a letter she had written to Archie’s brotherCampbell, telling him that she was on her way to a Yorkshire spa. She sent thisto his office in Woolwich so that he would not receive it until after theweekend. But in fact, on opening the letter Campbell Christie only glanced at itand then somehow managed to mislay it. This explains why it took so long forArchie and the police to find her – eleven days after her disappearance.Meanwhile, Archie got a little of his own back by telling a newspaper reporterthat his wife had discussed the possibility of “disappearing” – implying that itmight be a kind of practical joke or publicity stunt.And so Agatha sat in the Harrogate Hydro Hotel, reading the newspaper accountsof herself and doing the kind of things that overseas visitors – she claimed tobe from South Africa – did when they stay at a hotel during the Christmasholiday period.On Sunday, 12 December, hundreds of members of the public set out to comb theSurrey hills for the missing novelist when in fact two members of a band whoplayed in the Harrogate Hydro Hotel already thought they had recognized AgathaChristie on the dance floor, and went to inform the local police. A chambermaidcalled Rosie Asher had confirmed the bandsmens’ suspicions. She had noticed thatthe woman’s handbag had a zip, which was the first time she had ever seen thisnewly fashionable item but she was afraid to mention it to the management incase she lost her job. During the following Monday, plain-clothed police mingledwith the hotel guests and quickly arrived at the conclusion that they had foundAgatha Christie. The following day, the Yorkshire police rang Archie at work andasked him if he would travel to Harrogate to identify his wife. It must havebeen a relief to Archie to know that he was no longer suspected of his wife’smurder.Early that evening, Archie sat in the hotel lounge hidden behind a newspaper asAgatha walked in and paused to look at her own photograph on the front of anewspaper lying on a table. Then she saw her husband looking across at her. Withtypical English coolness, the couple said hello, and then, a few minutes later,went in to dinner. There, apparently, Agatha admitted that she had staged herdisappearance to spite her husband and that the prank had expanded beyond herexpectations.Now Archie learned that her sister-in-law Nan had known where she was all thetime and had even lent her the money to travel to Harrogate and stay in thehotel. Agatha had posted the letter to Campbell – which was supposed to haveguaranteed that she would be found quickly – and then had lunch with Nan inLondon. She then caught a train at 1.40 from King’s Cross to Harrogate, whereshe arrived six hours later.The following morning, decoys who looked like the Christies left the hotel to bepursued by a crowd of reporters, while the Daily Mail cameraman, who was theonly one who was left behind, took a photograph of the real Mr and Mrs Christieas they hurried out of the hotel at 9.15. At Harrogate station, they entered –by prior arrangement – by the goods entrance, but nevertheless found the Londonplatform jammed with dozens of reporters and photographers. Agatha’s sisterMadge had arrived, together with her husband Jimmy, but the attempt by the partyto deceive the reporters by splitting into two pairs, male and female, failed inits purpose and flashbulbs popped as the sisters scrambled on to the train, withAgatha close to tears. At Leeds, they managed to mislead the reporters bychanging trains, but the press caught up with them again in London where aphotographer snapped Agatha as she walked up the platform. She then had to runthe gauntlet of another crowd of reporters and managed to scramble on to theManchester train. But one of the photographs of her that appeared that eveningshowed her grinning broadly, and strengthened the general impression that thiswas some kind of publicity stunt or hoax.Seeking refuge at Abney Hall, in Cheadle, they were again besieged by newsmen,and Archie finally gave a single interview to a journalist who happened to bewearing his old school tie, explaining that his wife had lost her memory. Noone, of course believed him. When Archie finally returned home to Styles, hereceived a bill from the Surrey Constabulary for cost of the search – £25. Herefused to pay. But it was clear that the Surrey Police also felt that theChristies had been wasting their time.Agatha herself escaped further publicity by leaving the country, together withher secretary and her daughter, for the Canaries. While she was abroad Membersof Parliament raised questions in the House about the cost of the search, andone MP denounced the whole episode as a “cruel hoax”.In fact, although the disappearance did her reputation no harm in the long run,Agatha was to discover on her return to England, that many old friends no longerwanted to know her.Her disappearance had also failed in its immediate purpose – to persuade herhusband to stay with her. Archie Christie was the kind of person who dislikedpublicity even more than his wife did, and he resented the spotlight that hadbeen thrown on his affair with Nancy Neele. Less than two years later, in April1928, his wife divorced him, and shortly after that, he married Nancy Neele,with whom he continued to live happily until her death in the summer of 1958.Archie himself died in December 1962.Agatha Christie herself also found happiness of a kind. In 1930, she visited thearchaeological site at Ur, in Mesopotamia, where Leonard Woolley had foundevidence of what he believed to be the biblical Flood. There, Agatha metWoolley’s 25-year-old assistant, Max Mallowan, who was asked to take her on asight-seeing tour. She was fourteen years his senior but the two found they hadso much in common that when he asked her to marry him, she took very little timeto accept. She also insisted that they should pool their finances – Mallowan wasrelatively poor – and divide them equally. She had evidently learned from hermistake with her first husband. She also made Max promise never to play golf, towhich he immediately agreed.In 1947, after the war, Max was appointed to the archaeological chair at LondonUniversity. Here he was immensely popular with his students and since he was inhis early forties, he could not resist the temptation to have the occasionalaffair. Agatha found out about this from Nan, but she now reacted less violentlythan with Archie, and so the two remained married until her death.In 1948 Agatha’s financial fortunes reached a new peak when Penguin Bookspublished a million of her paperbacks in one day. She was now the mostsuccessful detective writer of all time.As she approached her eighties her health began to deteriorate and on 12 January1976, she died quietly while Max pushed her in her wheelchair.In 1997 the BBC made a documentary on the disappearance of Agatha Christie, anda young writer named Jared Kade was appointed as research assistant. The finalresult of that assignment was his book Agatha Christie and the Eleven MissingDays (1998), to which this present account is greatly indebted."},{"pageContent":"9 The Cleveland Torso MurdersWho Was “the Mad Butcher”?The American equivalent of the Jack the Ripper murders (described in chapter 27)was the Cleveland Torso case. The Cleveland murders were more numerous, and insome ways – as will be seen – more horrific, than their Victorian counterparts.On a warm September afternoon in 1935, two boys on their way home from schoolwalked along a dusty, sooty gully known as Kingsbury Run, in the heart ofCleveland, Ohio. On a weed-covered slope known as Jackass Hill, one challengedthe other to a race, and they hurtled sixty feet down the slope to the bottom.Sixteen-year-old James Wagner was the winner, and as he halted, panting, henoticed something white in the bushes a few yards away. A closer look revealedthat it was a naked body and that it was headless.The police who arrived soon after found the body of a young white male clad onlyin black socks; the genitals had been removed. It lay on its back, with the legsstretched out and the arms by the sides, as if laid out for a funeral. Thirtyfeet away the policemen found another body, that of an older man, lying in thesame position; it had also been decapitated and emasculated.Hair sticking out of the ground revealed one of the missing heads buried a fewyards away; the second proved to be buried nearby. Both sets of genitals werealso found lying nearby, as if thrown away by the killer.One curious feature of the crimes was that there was no blood on the ground oron the bodies, which were quite clean. It looked as if the victims had beenkilled and beheaded elsewhere, then carefully washed when they had ceased tobleed.Forensic examination revealed even more baffling evidence. The older corpse wasbadly decomposed and the skin discoloured; the pathologists discovered that thiswas due to some unidentifiable chemical substance, perhaps used by the killer inan attempt to preserve the body. The man had been dead about two weeks. Theyounger man had only been dead three days. His fingerprints enabled the policeto identify him as twenty-eight-year-old Edward Andrassy, who had a minor policerecord for carrying concealed weapons. He lived near Kingsbury Run and had areputation as a drunken brawler.But the most chilling discovery was that Andrassy had actually died as a resultof decapitation. Rope marks on his wrists revealed that he had been tied and hadstruggled violently. The killer had apparently cut off his head with a knife.The skill with which the operation had been performed suggested a butcher – orpossibly a surgeon.It proved impossible to identify the older man. But the identification ofAndrassy led the police to hope that it would not be too difficult to trace hiskiller. Andrassy had spent his nights gambling and drinking in a slummy part oftown – the third precinct – and was known as a pimp. Further investigation alsorevealed that he had had male lovers. Lead after lead looked extremelypromising. The husband of a married woman with whom he had had an affair hadsworn to kill him. But the man was able to prove his innocence. So were variousshady characters who might have borne a grudge. Lengthy police investigation ledto a dead end – as it did in another ten cases involving the killer who becameknown as “the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run”.Four months later, on a raw January Sunday, the howling of a dog finally led awoman who lived on East Twentieth Street – not far from Kingsbury Run – to goand investigate. She found the chained animal trying to get at a basket standingnear a factory wall. Minutes later she told a passing neighbour that the basketcontained hams. But the neighbour soon recognized the “hams” as being parts of ahuman arm. A burlap bag proved to contain the female torso. The head wasmissing, as were the left arm and the lower parts of both legs. But fingerprintsagain enabled the police to trace the victim, who had a record as a prostitute.She proved to be forty-one-year-old Florence (“Flo”) Polillo, a squat,double-chinned woman who was well known in the neighbourhood bars.Again, there were plenty of leads, and again, all of them petered out. Two weekslater the victim’s left arm and lower legs were found in a vacant lot. The headwas never recovered.The murder of Flo Polillo raised an unwelcome question. The first two murdershad convinced the police that they were looking for a homosexual sadist, whichat least simplified the investigation; this latest crime made it look as if thekiller was quite simply a sadist – like Peter Kürten, the Düsseldorf killerexecuted in 1931; he had killed men, women, and children indiscriminately, andhe was not remotely homosexual. The pathologist also recalled that a year beforethat first double murder, the torso of an unknown woman had been found on theedge of Lake Erie. It began to look as if the Mad Butcher was a psychopath whowas simply obsessed with the dissection of human corpses, as some boys enjoypulling the wings off flies.Cleveland residents felt they had one thing in their favour, however. Since thedouble killing, the famous Eliot Ness had been appointed Cleveland’s director ofpublic safety. Ness and his “Untouchables” had cleared up Chicago’s Prohibitionrackets, and in 1934 Ness had moved to Cleveland to fight its gangsters. WithNess in charge, the newspapers were confident that the Head Hunter of KingsburyRun – another press sobriquet – would find himself becoming the hunted.But it was soon clear to Ness that hunting a sadistic pervert was totally unlikehunting professional gangsters. The killer struck at random, and unless he wascareless enough to leave behind a clue – like a fingerprint – then the only hopewas to catch him in the act. And Ness soon became convinced that the Mad Butchertook great pleasure in feeling that he was several steps ahead of the police.The Head Hunter waited until the summer before killing again, then lived up tohis name by leaving the head of a young man, wrapped in a pair of trousers,under a bridge in Kingsbury Run; again, two boys found it – on 22 June 1936. Thebody was found a quarter of a mile away, and it was obvious from the blood thatthe man had been killed where he lay. Again, medical examination revealed thatthe victim had died as a result of decapitation – though it was not clear howthe killer had prevented the victim from struggling while he removed his head.The victim was about twenty-five and heavily tattooed. There was no record ofhis fingerprints in police files. Three weeks later a young female hikerdiscovered another decapitated male body in a gully, with the head lying nearby.The decomposition made it clear that this man had been killed before thepreviously discovered victim.The last “butchery” of 1936 was that of a man of about thirty, who was alsofound in Kingsbury Run; the body had been cut in two and emasculated. A hatfound nearby led to a partial identification: a housewife recalled giving it toa young tramp. Not far away was a “hobo camp” where down-and-outs slept; thiswas obviously where the Butcher had found his latest victim.The fact that Cleveland had been the scene of a Republican convention and wasnow the site of a Great Exposition led to even more frantic police activity andmuch press criticism. The murders were reported all over the world, and in NaziGermany and Fascist Italy they were cited as proof of the decadence of the NewWorld.As month after month went by with no further grisly discoveries, Clevelandersbegan to believe they had heard the last of the Mad Butcher. But in February1937 that hope proved unfounded when the killer left the body of a young womanin a chopped-up pile on the shores of Lake Erie. She was never identified. Theeighth victim was identified from her teeth as Mrs Rose Wallace, age forty; onlythe skeleton remained, and it looked as if she might have been killed in theprevious year.Victim number nine was male and had been dismembered; when his body was fishedout of the river, the head was missing, and it was never found. This time thekiller had gone even further in his mutilations, disemboweling the corpse in themanner of Jack the Ripper. It was impossible to identify the victim. It wasbelieved that two men seen in a boat might be the Butcher and an accomplice, butthis suggestion led nowhere.The killer now seemed to take a rest for nine months. Then the lower part of aleg was pulled out of the river. Three weeks later two burlap bags found in theriver proved to contain more body fragments, which enabled the pathologist toannounce that the victim was a brunette female of about twenty-five. She wasnever identified.The killer was to strike twice more. More than a year after the last discovery,in August 1938, the dismembered torso of a woman was found at a dump on thelakefront, and a search of the area revealed the bones of a second victim, amale. A quilt in which the remains of this twelfth victim were wrapped wasidentified as one that had been given to a junkman. Neither body could beidentified.One thing was now obvious: the Butcher was selecting his victims from vagrantsand down-and-outs. Ness decided to take the only kind of action that seemed leftto him: two days after the last find police raided the shantytown near KingsburyRun, arrested hundreds of vagrants, and burned it down. Whether by coincidenceor not, the murders ceased.Two of the most efficient of the man hunters, Detectives Merylo and Zalewski,had spent a great deal of time searching for the killer’s “labouratory”. At onepoint they thought they had found it, when a negative left behind by one of theearliest victims, Edward Andrassy, was developed and showed Andrassy lounging ona bed in an unknown room. The photograph was published in newspapers and theroom was finally identified by a petty crook as being the bedroom of amiddle-aged homosexual who lived with his two sisters. Upon investigation, bloodwas found on the floor of the room, and a large butcher knife was discovered ina trunk. But the blood proved to be the suspect’s own – he was subject tonosebleeds – and the butcher knife showed no trace of blood. And when anotherbody turned up while the suspect was in jail for sodomy, it became clear that hewas not the Torso killer.Next the investigators discovered that Flo Polillo and Rose Wallace hadfrequented the same saloon and that Andrassy had been a regular there too. Theyalso learned of a middle-aged man named Frank Dolezal who carried knives andthreatened people with them when drunk. When they learned that this man had alsobeen living with Flo Polillo, they believed they had finally identified thekiller. Dolezal was arrested, and police discovered a brown substance resemblingdried blood in the cracks of his bathroom floor. Knives with dried bloodstainson them provided further incriminating evidence. Under intensive questioning,Dolezal, a bleary-eyed, unkempt man, confessed to the murder of Flo Polillo, andthe newspapers triumphantly announced the capture of the Butcher. Then thingsbegan to go wrong. Forensic tests showed that the “dried blood” in the bathroomwas not blood after all. Dolezal’s “confession” proved to be full of errorsabout the corpse and the method of disposal. And when, in August 1939, Dolezalhanged himself in jail, the autopsy revealed that he had two cracked ribs, whichsuggested that his confession had been obtained by force.The two victims of August 1938 proved to be the Butcher’s last – at least inCleveland. In Pittsburgh in 1940 three decapitated bodies were found in oldboxcars. Members of Ness’s team went to investigate, but no clue to the treblemurder was ever discovered. The Mad Butcher was also blamed for the Black Dahliakilling in Hollywood in 1947, when an aspiring film actress named ElizabethShort was dissected, like victim number seven. It seems highly unlikely,however, that the Mad Butcher survived that long; a large percentage of sadistickillers commit suicide.Steven Nickel’s book on the case, Torso (1989), makes it clear that there weremany suspects in Cleveland who might have been capable of committing themurders. One man, nicknamed the “Chicken Freak”, was known to the prostitutes ofthe third precinct because he could achieve orgasm only when watching a chickenbeing decapitated; he would go to a brothel with two live chickens and a largebutcher knife. Naked prostitutes would be asked to behead the chickens while helooked on and masturbated; if he failed to reach a climax, the bloody knife hadto be rubbed against his throat. Finally arrested, the “Chicken Freak” proved tobe a truck driver who admitted that he made a habit of intercourse withchickens. But he was so obviously nauseated when shown photographs of the Torsovictims that he was allowed to go.Why have the Torso murders never achieved the same grim celebrity as the crimesof Jack the Ripper? The reason is that Cleveland in the mid-1930s was a far moreviolent city than London in the 1880s and the crimes made far less impact on thepublic imagination than the Ripper’s sadistic murder of prostitutes in VictorianLondon. Ten years before the Cleveland murders began, six decapitated malebodies were found in a swamp near New Castle, a small town ninety milessoutheast of Cleveland. The victims were never identified; the local policeconcluded that they had been killed by gangsters in the course of bootleg warsand that the swamp was a convenient dumping ground.Sadly, the last decade of Eliot Ness’s life – he died in 1957, at the age offifty-four – was full of poverty and disappointment. He resigned as Cleveland’sSafety Director in April 1941, after a scandal involving a hit-and-run accident.In 1947 he was heavily defeated when he ran for the post of mayor of Cleveland.A year later he was even turned down for a sixty-dollar-a-week job. “He simplyran out of gas” said one friend. In 1953, after five years of obscurity andpoverty, he became involved with a paper-making company tottering on the vergeof bankruptcy. But it was through a friend in the company that Ness met ajournalist named Oscar Fraley and began telling him the story of hisanti-bootlegging days. In the course of their conversations, Ness told Fraleythat he was reasonably certain that he knew the identity of the Torso killer andthat he had driven him out of Cleveland.Ness told Fraley the following: He had reasoned that the killer was a man whohad a house of his own in which he could dismember the bodies and a car in whichhe could transport them. So he was not, after all, a down-and-out. The skill ofthe mutilations suggested medical training, or at least a certain degree ofmedical knowledge. The fact that some of the victims had been strong mensuggested that the Butcher had to be big and powerful – a conclusion supportedby a size-12 footprint near one of the bodies.Ness had three of his top agents, Virginia Allen, Barney Davis, and Jim Manski,make inquiries among the upper levels of Cleveland society. Virginia was asophisticated woman with contacts among Cleveland socialites, and it was she wholearned about a man who sounded like the ideal suspect. The suspect, whom Nesswas to call “Gaylord Sundheim”, was a big man from a well-to-do family who had ahistory of psychiatric problems. He had also studied medicine. When the three“Untouchables” called on him, he leered sarcastically at Virginia and closed thedoor in their faces. Ness invited him – pressingly – to lunch, and he came underprotest. He refused either to admit or deny having performed the murders. Nesspersuaded him to take a lie detector test, and “Sundheim’s” answers to questionsabout the murders were registered by the stylus as lies. When Ness finally toldhim he believed he was the Torso killer – hoping that shock tactics mighttrigger a confession – “Sundheim” sneered, “Prove it”.Soon after this, “Sundheim” had himself committed to a mental institution. Nessknew he was now “untouchable”, for even if Ness could prove his guilt, he couldplead insanity.Ness went on to collabourate with Fraley on a book entitled The Untouchables. Itcame out in 1957 and was an immense success, becoming a bestseller and leadingto a famous TV series. But Ness never knew about its success; he had died of aheart attack on 16 May 1957, six months before The Untouchables was published."},{"pageContent":"10 Crop CirclesUFOs, Whirlwinds, or Hoaxers?On 15 August 1980, the Wiltshire Times carried an odd report concerning theapparently wanton vandalism of a field of oats near Westbury in Wiltshire,England. The owner of the field, John Scull, had found his oats crushed to theground in three separate areas, all within sight of the famous White Horse ofWestbury, a hillside figure cut into the chalk. It seemed obvious to Scull thatthe crops had been damaged by people rather than natural phenomena since theareas were identical in shape and size: almost perfect circles, each sixty feetin diameter.It was also noted that the circles had apparently been produced manually ratherthan mechanically, since there was no sign that any kind of machinery had beenmoved through the field. In fact, there seemed to be no evidence of anythingcrossing the field; the circles were surrounded by undamaged oats, with no pathsthat would indicate intruders. One speculation was that the vandals had usedstilts.Close examination of the flattened cereal revealed that the circles had not beenmade at the same time – that in fact, the damage had been spread over a periodof two or three months, probably between May and the end of July. The edges ofthe circles were sharply defined, and all the grain within the circles wasflattened in the same direction, creating a clockwise swirling effect around thecentres. None of the oats had been cut – merely flattened. The effect might havebeen produced by a very tall, strong man standing in the centre of each circleand swinging a heavy weight around on a long piece of rope.Dr Terence Meaden, an atmospheric physicist from nearby Bradford-on-Avon and asenior member of the Tornado and Storm Research Organization (TORRO), suggestedthat the circles had been produced by a summer whirlwind. Such wind effects arenot uncommon on open farmland. But Dr Meaden had to admit that he had never seenor heard of a whirlwind creating circles. Whirlwinds tend to scud aboutrandomly, pausing for only a few seconds in any one place, so one might expect arandom pathway through the crop.Another interesting fact was noted by Ian Mrzyglod, editor of the “anomaly”magazine The PROBE Report. The “centre point” on all three circles was actuallyoff centre by as much as four feet. The swirling patterns around these pointswere therefore oval, not circular. This seemed to contradict the vandal theory –vandals would hardly go to the trouble of creating precise ellipses. It alsomade Meaden’s whirlwind explanation seem less plausible.Almost exactly a year later, on 19 August 1981, another three-circle formationappeared in a wheatfield below Cheesefoot Head, near Winchester in Hampshire.These circles had been created simultaneously and, unlike the widely dispersedcircles in Wiltshire, were in close formation – one circle sixty feet acrosswith two twenty-five-foot circles on either side. But the sides of these circleshad the same precise edges as the Wiltshire circles, and again, the swirl of theflattened plants was slightly off-centre, creating ellipses. And again therewere no paths through the grain to indicate intruders.The new evidence seemed to undermine the natural-causes theory. Instead of aneat, stationary whirlwind creating only one circle, Meaden now had to argue theexistence of an atmospheric disturbance that hopscotched across the landscapeand produced circles of different sizes. Meaden suggested that perhapspeculiarities of terrain created this effect – the field in question was on aconcave, “punchbowl” slope, and this might indeed have caused the vortex to“jump”.There were a few isolated reports of similar incidents in 1982, but they wereunspectacular and excited little attention. As if to make up for it, a series offive-circle phenomena began in 1983, one of them at Bratton, again close to theWhite Horse of Westbury. These were clearly not caused by whirlwinds, for theyconsisted of one large circle with four smaller ones spaced around it like thenumber five on a die. A “quintuplet” appeared in Cley Hill, near Warminster – atown that, in earlier years, had had more than its share of “flying saucer”sightings. Another appeared in a field below Ridgeway near Wantage inOxfordshire. Quintuplets were no longer freaks but were virtually the norm.Now the national press began to cover the phenomena. The British press oftenrefer to the summer as the “silly season” because, for some odd reason, there isoften a shortage of good news stories in the hot months of the year, andnewspapers tend to make up for the deficiency by blowing up trivia into majornews stories. Crop circles answered the need perfectly, with the result that theBritish public soon became familiar with the strange circle formations. UFOenthusiasts appeared on television explaining their view that the phenomenacould be explained only by flying saucers. Skeptics preferred the notion offraud.This latter view seemed to be confirmed when a second quintuplet found atBratton turned out to be a hoax sponsored by the Daily Mirror; a family namedShepherd had been paid to duplicate the other Bratton circles. They did this byentering the field on stilts and trampling the crops underfoot. But,significantly, the hoax was quickly detected by Bob Rickard, the editor of ananomaly magazine, the Fortean Times, who noted the telltale signs of humanintruders, which had not been present in earlier circles, and the fact that theedges of the circles were quite rough and imprecise. The aim of the hoax was toembarrass the competing tabloid, the Daily Express, which had originally scoopedthe cropcircle story.Over the next two years the number of circles increased, as did theircomplexity. There were crop circles with “rings” around them – flattenedpathways several feet wide that ran around the outer edge in a neat circle. Somewere even found with two or three such rings. At the same time the quintupletformations and “singletons” also continued to appear.It began to look as if whoever – or whatever – was creating the circles tookpleasure in taunting the investigators. When believers in the whirlwind theorypointed out that the swirling had so far been clockwise, a counterclockwisecircle promptly appeared. When it was suggested that a hoaxer might be makingthe circles with the aid of a helicopter, a crop circle was found directlybeneath a power line. When an aerial photographer named Busty Taylor was flyinghome after photographing crop circles and mentioned that he would like to see aformation in the shape of a Celtic cross, a Celtic cross appeared the next dayin the field over which he had been flying. And, as if to rule out allpossibility that natural causes could be responsible, one “sextuplet” inHampshire in 1990 had keylike objects sticking out of the sides of threecircles, producing the impression of an ancient pictogram. Another crop“pattern” of 1990 (at Chilcomb) seemed to represent a kind of chemical retortwith a long neck, with four rectangles neatly spaced on either side of it,making nonsense of Meaden’s insistence that the circles were caused by “naturalatmospheric forces”.Rickard brought together a number of eyewitness descriptions of the actualappearance of circles:> Suddenly the grass began to sway before our eyes and laid itself flat in a> clockwise spiral . . . A perfect circle was completed in less than half a> minute, all the time accompanied by a high-pitched humming sound . . . My> attention was drawn to a “wave” coming through the heads of the cereal crop in> a straight line . . . The agency, though invisible, behaved like a solid> object . . . When we reached the spot where the circles had been, we were> suddenly caught up in a terrific whirlwind . . . [The dog] went wild . . .> There was a rushing sound and a rumble . . . then suddenly everything was> still . . . It was uncanny . . . The dawn chorus stopped; the sky darkened . .> .> > The high-pitched humming sound may be significant. It was noted on anotheroccasion, on 16 June 1991, when a seventy-five-foot circle (with a “bull’s-eye”in the centre) appeared on Bolberry Down, near Salcombe in Devon. A localham-radio operator named Lew Dilling was tuned into a regular frequency whenstrange high-pitched blips and clicks emerged. He recognized the sounds as beingthe same as others that had been heard in connection with crop-circle incidents.“The signals were so powerful”, said Dilling, “that you could hear them in thebackground of Radio Moscow and Voice of America – and they would normally swampeverything”.The landlord of the local pub, Sean Hassall, learned of the crop circleindirectly when his spaniel went berserk and began tearing up the carpet, doingconsiderable damage.The owner of the field, Dudley Stidson, was alerted to the circle by twowalkers. He went to the six-acre hayfield and found a giant circle in thecentre. But this one differed from many such circles in that the hay was burned,as if someone had put a huge hot-plate on it. Stidson emphasized that there wasno sign of intrusion in the field, such as trampled wheat.Another local farmer, Peter Goodall, found a sixty-foot circle in his winterwheat (at Matford Barton) at the same time.A few days before these incidents occurred, a Japanese professor announced thathe had solved the crop-circle mystery. Professor Yoshihiko Ohtsuki, of Tokyo’sWaseda University, had created an “elastic plasma” fireball – a very strong formof ionized air – in the labouratory. When the fireball touched a plate coveredwith aluminum powder, it created beautiful circles and rings in the powder.Ohtsuki suggested that plasma fireballs were created by atmospheric conditionsand that they would flatten crops as they descended toward the ground. Thiscertainly sounded as if it could be the solution of the mystery – until it wasrecalled that some of the crop circles had rectangles or keylike objectssticking out of their sides. Another objection was that fireballs are usuallyabout the size of footballs and are clearly visible. Surely a fireball with aseventy-five-foot diameter would be visible for many miles? And why were nofireballs seen by the eyewitnesses cited by Rickard, who simply saw the cornbeing flattened in a clockwise circle?Another recent suggestion is that an excess of fertilizer will cause the corn onwhich it is used to shoot up much faster than that which surrounds it, afterwhich it will collapse and lie flat. There are two objections to this theory:Why would a farmer spray an excess of fertilizer in a circle – or some even morecomplicated design? And why would the corn collapse in a clockwise direction?In a symposium entitled “The Crop Circle Enigma” (1990), John Michell made theimportant suggestion that the crop circles have a meaning and that “the meaning. . . is to be found in the way people are affected by them”. In conjunctionwith this idea, Michell noted that “Jung discerned the meaning of UFOs as agentsand portents of changes in human thought patterns, and that function has beenclearly inherited by crop circles”.In order to understand this fully, we have to bear in mind Jung’s concept of“synchronicity” or “meaningful coincidence”, His view is basically that“meaningful coincidences” are somehow created by the unconscious mind – probablywith the intention of jarring the conscious mind into a keener state ofperception. Preposterous synchronicities imbue us with a powerful sense thatthere is a hidden meaning behind everyday reality. Certain pessimisticallyinclined writers – such as Shakespeare and Thomas Hardy – have taken the viewthat accidents and disasters indicate a kind of malevolent intelligence behindlife. Jung’s view is that synchronicities produce a sense of a benevolentintelligence behind life. He once suggested that the UFO phenomenon was anexample of what he called “projection” – that is, of a physical effect somehowproduced by the unconscious mind, in fact, by the “collective unconscious”.Michell was, in effect, suggesting that the crop-circle phenomenon serves thesame purpose. Yet to say, as he did, that the crop circles have a “meaning”could also imply that some “other intelligence” is trying to influence humanthought patterns. This is an idea that has been current since the earliest UFOsightings in the late 1940s and was popularized by Arthur C. Clarke in thescreenplay of the film 2001: A Space Odyssey: specifically, the notion that“higher intelligences” have been involved in the evolution of the human brain.The logical objection to this theory is that to “make” man evolve is acontradiction in terms; evolution is the result of an inner drive. Presumably, ahigher intelligence would recognize this better than we do. Yet it is also truethat intelligence evolves through a sense of curiosity, of mystery, and thatsuch apparent absurdities as flying saucers and crop circles certainly qualifyas mysteries.Michell concluded by quoting Jung’s words that UFOs are “signs of great changesto come which are compatible with the end of an era”. And whether or not Jungwas correct, there can be no doubt that the UFO phenomenon has played anenormous part in the transformation of human consciousness from the narrowscientific materialism of the first half of the twentieth century to the muchmore open-minded attitude of its second half. Whether or not the crop circlesprove to have a “natural” explanation, this may be their ultimate significancein the history of the late twentieth century.Postscript: In early September 1991, a number of self-proclaimed hoaxers madesimultaneous confessions to fabricating crop circles. Two of them, Dave Chorleyand Doug Bower, claimed to have been making crop circles for thirteen years.Fred Day declared that he had been making them “all his life”. Chorley and Bowerdemonstrated their technique by flattening corn in a field with a plank in frontof TV cameras and crop-circle investigators. As in the case of the earlier DailyMirror hoax, the investigators pointed out that the Chorley-Bower circle wasvisibly amateurish.At the time of writing, the position taken by “cereologists” is that while someof the circles may be hoaxes, the majority show signs of being genuine, such asgeometric perfection and an obvious lack of trampling of surrounding crops byhuman feet. The ultimate test, of course, will be whether crop circles nowsimply cease to appear – the silliest hoaxer gets tired of repetition – orwhether, like “flying saucer” sightings, they continue to be as numerous asever. Readers who pick up this book in the year 2025 will be in a betterposition to assess the possibilities than the authors are in 2000."},{"pageContent":"11 The Curse of the PharaohsOn 26 November 1922 the archaeologist Howard Carter peered through a smallopening above the door of the tomb of Tutankhamon’s tomb, holding a candle infront of him. What he saw dazzled him: “everywhere the glint of gold”. He andhis colleague Lord Carnarvon had made the greatest find in the history ofarchaeology. But a few days later they found a clay tablet with the hieroglyphicinscription: “Death will slay with his wings whoever disturbs the peace of thepharaoh”. The following April Lord Carnarvon died of some unknown disease. By1929 – a mere six years later – twenty-two people who had been involved inopening the tomb had died prematurely. Other archaeologists dismissed talk about“the curse of the pharaohs” as journalistic sensationalism. Yet it is difficultto imagine that this long series of deaths was merely a frightening coincidence.Tutankhamon was the heir of the “great heretic” Akhnaton (about 1375 BC to1360), the first monotheist king in history. He abandoned the capital Thebes,with all its temples, and built himself a new capital, called Akhetaton (Horizonof Aton), at a place now called Tell el Amarna. He worshipped only one god, thesun god Aton. His people, who were more comfortable with the host of old animalgods, disliked this new religion, and were relieved when Akhnaton died young, orperhaps possibly murdered. (So were the priests!) His successor was hisson-in-law – possibly his son – Tutankhamon, who was a mere child when he cameto the throne, and who died of a blow on the head at the age of eighteen.Historically speaking, therefore, Tutankhamon is a nonentity, whose name hardlydeserves to be remembered. His only achievement – if it can be called that – wasto restore the old religion, and move his capital back to Thebes. No one knowshow he died, whether from a fall, or possibly from the blow of an assassin.The strangest part of this story is still to come. The high priest (and courtchamberlain) was a man called Ay. He seized power, and married Tutankhamon’sfifteen-year-old widow, Enhosnamon. He reigned less than four years, and onceagain the throne was seized by a usurper, a general called Horemheb, who hadbeen a little too slow off the mark when Tutankhamon died. The wait for thethrone had apparently filled him with resentment; as soon as he became pharaoh,he behaved like a dictator, and set out to erase the names of Akhnaton andTutankhamon from history; he had their names chiselled off all hieroglyphicinscriptions, and used the stones of the great temple of the sun at Tell elAmarna to build three pyramids in Thebes. He even destroyed many tombs of thecourtiers of Ay and Tutankhamon.Yet he omitted to do the most obvious thing of all: to destroy the tomb ofTutankhamon, and to seize its treasures for his own treasury. Why? One possibleexplanation is that the location of the tomb was kept secret. But that isunlikely; after all, Horemheb came to the throne a mere four years after thedeath of Tutankhamon; even if the tomb’s location was a secret, there must havebeen dozens of priests or workmen who could have been “persuaded” to reveal it.It is natural to suspect that Horemheb had some other reason for deciding toleave the tomb inviolate . . .Howard Carter, the man who finally discovered the tomb, had come out to Egypt asa teenager – he was born in 1873 – and while still in his twenties became ChiefInspector of Monuments for Upper Egypt and Nubia. Acting on his advice, awealthy American, Theodore Davis, began excavating the Valley of the Kings in1902. In the previous year grave-robbers had mounted an armed attack on the menguarding the newly discovered tomb of Amonhotep II – a bloodthirsty characterwho was the great-grandfather of Akhnaton – and made off with all its gold andjewels. Carter had rounded them up and prosecuted them, an action that made himso unpopular with the Egyptians that he found himself without a job. TheodoreDavis took him on as a draughtsman, and with Carter’s help made some astonishingdiscoveries, including the tomb of Horemheb, of the great Queen Hatshepsut, andof Akhnaton’s grandfather Thutmose IV.It was during this period that there was a curious curtain-raiser to the storyof the curse of the pharaohs. Joe Linden Smith was another skilled draughtsmanwho worked closely with the excavators; he was married to an attractive28-year-old American named Corinna. Among their closest friends were Arthur andHortense Weigel; Weigel was an English archaeologist, while Hortense, likeCorinna, was a young American. One day when they were descending the slope intothe Valley of the Queens, Smith and Weigel came upon a natural amphitheatre thatstruck them as the ideal site for the presentation of a play. They decided topresent their own “mystery play”, and to invite most of the archaeologicalcommunity from Luxor. But the purpose was not mere entertainment. Both men hadimmense admiration for Akhnaton and for the artistic productions of his reign,which were far more lifelike than the stylized works of other periods. Their aimwas nothing less than to intercede with the ancient gods to lift the curse thatconsigned Akhnaton’s spirit to wander for all eternity.According to tradition, Akhnaton died on 26 January 1363 BC. Smith and Weigeldecided to present their play on 26 January 1909, and the invitations were sent.On 23 January they held their dress rehearsal. The god Horus appeared andconversed with the wandering spirit of Akhnaton – played by Hortense – offeringto grant him a wish; Akhnaton asked to see his mother, Queen Tiy. The Queen wassummoned by a magical ceremony; she spoke of her sadness to see her soncondemned to eternal misery. Akhnaton replied that even in his misery he stilldrew comfort from the thought of the god Aton; he asked his mother to recite hishymn to Aton . . .As Corinna Smith began to recite the hymn her words were drowned by the risingwind. Suddenly a violent storm was upon them; the gale blew sand and smallstones, so the cowering workmen thought the gods were stoning them. Therehearsal had to be abandoned, and the actors hurried back to theirheadquarters, the nearby tomb of Amet-Hu, once governor of Thebes. Later thatevening Corinna complained of a pain in her eyes, and Hortense of cramps in herstomach. That night both had similar dreams; they were in the nearby temple ofAmon, standing before the statue of the god; he came to life and struck themwith his flail – Corinna in the eyes, Hortense in the stomach. The next dayCorinna was in agony with inflamed eyes, and had to be rushed to a specialist inCairo, who diagnosed one of the worst cases of trachoma – Egyptian ophthalmia –he had ever seen. Twenty-four hours later, Hortense joined Corinna in the samenursing-home; during the stomach operation that followed she came close tolosing her life. The play had to be abandoned.Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon had both been invited to the play; at thisperiod Carter was working for Theodore Davis. By 1914 Davis had decided that hehad now found all there was to be found in the Valley of the Kings, and decidedto abandon his labours. Carnarvon snapped up the concession. He knew that Daviswas convinced that he had found the grave of Tutankhamon, a pit grave containinggold plates and other items; but neither Carnarvon nor Carter believed that apharaoh would be buried so modestly.The war made it impossible to begin digging until 1917. Then Carter began todig, slowly and systematically, moving hundreds of tons of rubble left fromearlier digs. He found nothing. By 1922 Carnarvon felt he had poured enoughmoney into the Valley of the Kings. Carter begged for one more chance.On 1 November 1922 he began new excavations, digging a ditch southward from thetomb of Rameses IV. On 4 November the workmen uncovered a step below thefoundations of some huts Carter had discovered in an earlier dig. By eveningtwelve steps had been revealed, then a sealed stone gate. Carter hastened tosend a telegram to Carnarvon in England; Carnarvon arrived just over two weekslater. Together Carnarvon and Carter broke their way through the sealed gate,now in a state of increasing excitement as they realized that this tomb wasvirtually unplundered. Thirty feet below the gate, they came upon a second. Withtrembling hands, Carter scraped a hole in the debris in its upper corner, andpeered through; the candlelight showed him strange animals, statues and gold.There were overturned chariots, lifesize figures, gilded couches, a gold-inlaidthrone. But there was no mummy, for this was only the antechamber. However, itwas in this antechamber that they found the tablet with the inscription: “Deathwill slay with his wings whoever disturbs the peace of the pharaoh”. It wasrecorded by Carter, then disappeared – they were afraid rumours of theinscription might terrify the workmen. A statue of Horus also carried aninscription stating that it was the protector of the grave. On 17 February 1923a group of distinguished people was invited to witness the opening of the tombitself. It took two hours to chisel a hole through into the burial chamber. Thenonly two sets of folding doors separated them from the magnificent goldsarcophagus that was to become world-famous; they decided to leave that foranother day. The wealth that surrounded them made them all feel dazed.Carnarvon was never to see it. That April he fell ill. At breakfast one morninghe had a temperature of 104, and it continued for twelve days; his doctorssuspected that he had opened an old wound with his razor while shaving, but thefever suggested a mosquito-bite. Howard Carter was sent for. Carnarvon died justbefore two in the morning. As the family came to his bedside, summoned by anurse, all the lights suddenly went out, and they were forced to light candles.Later they went on again. It was a power failure that affected all Cairo. Someaccounts of Lord Carnarvon’s death state that the failure has never beenexplained, but none of them mention whether any inquiry was actually addressedto the Cairo Electricity Board.According to Lord Carnarvon’s son, another peculiar event took place that night;back in England, Carnarvon’s favourite fox terrier began to howl, then died.The newspapers quickly began printing stories about the “curse of the pharaohs”.This was partly Carnarvon’s own fault; he had sold exclusive rights in theTutankhamon story to the London Times, and other newspapers had to print anystories they could unearth or concoct. But the curse story hardly needed anyjournalistic retouching. Arthur Mace, the American archaeologist who had helpedunseal the tomb, began to complain of exhaustion soon after Carnarvon’s death;he fell into a coma and died in the same hotel – the Continental – not longafter Carnarvon. George Jay Gould, son of the famous American financier, came toEgypt when he heard of Carnarvon’s death, and Carter took him to see the tomb.The next day he had fever; by evening he was dead. Joel Wool, a Britishindustrialist who visited the grave site, died of fever on his way back toEngland. Archibald Douglas Reid, a radiologist who X-rayed Tutankhamon’s mummy,sufferèd attacks of feebleness and died on his return to England in 1924. Overthe next few years thirteen people who had helped open the grave also died, andby 1929 the figure had risen to twenty-two. In 1929 Lady Carnarvon died of an“insect bite”, and Carter’s secretary Richard Bethell was found dead in bed of acirculatory collapse. Professor Douglas Derry, one of two scientists whoperformed the autopsy on Tutankhamon’s mummy, had died of circulatory collapsein 1925; the other scientist, Alfred Lucas, died of a heart attack at about thesame time.In his book The Curse of the Pharaohs, Philip Vandenburg not only lists thedeaths associated with Tutankhamon, but goes on to mention many otherarchaeologists associated with Egypt who have died prematurely. He points outhow frequently these deaths seem to involve a curious exhaustion – Carterhimself suffered from this, as well as from fits of depression – and speculateswhether the ancient priests of Egypt knew of poisons or fungoid growths thatwould retain their power down the centuries. Among the premature deaths hementions François Champollion, who decoded the Rosetta Stone, the greatEgyptologist Belzoni, the Swabian doctor Theodore Bilharz (after whom thedisease bilharzia was named), the archaeologist Georg Möller, and Carter’s closeassociate Professor James Henry Breasted. It was James Breasted who reportedthat Carter became sick and feeble after excavating the tomb, that he seemed attimes “not all there”, and that he had difficulty making decisions. Carter diedat sixty-six.Vandenberg begins his book by citing a conversation he had with Dr Gamal Mehrez,director-general of the Antiquities Department of the Cairo Museum. Mehrez, whowas fifty-two, expressed disbelief in the idea of a curse. “Look at me. I’vebeen involved with tombs and mummies of pharaohs all my life. I’m living proofthat it was all coincidence”. Four weeks later Mehrez had died of circulatorycollapse . . .Yet although Vandenberg himself seems to discount the coincidence theory, hisattempts to explain the “curse” scientifically are unconvincing – he evenconsiders the possibility that the shape of the pyramid can cause it to absorbcertain cosmic energies capable of affecting human health, and that theEgyptians “knew how to influence radioactive decay”.The ancients themselves would have dismissed such theories as absurd. For them acurse was the result of a ritual to evoke a guardian “demon” or spirit. Suchbeliefs have survived down to modern times. The psychical researcher Guy LyonPlayfair has described the years he spent in Brazil, and how he investigated“poltergeist” hauntings which appeared to be the result of a curse – that is tosay, of “black magic”. Most investigators of the paranormal are inclined tobelieve that the poltergeist – “noisy ghost” – is some kind of unconsciousmanifestation of the mind of a “disturbed” teenager, and that when objectssuddenly fly around the room, this is due to “spontaneous psychokinesis”.Playfair, while accepting this explanation in some cases, nevertheless came tobelieve that most poltergeists are in fact disembodied “spirits”. Such spiritscan be persuaded, by means of rituals, to “haunt” certain individuals, or tocause disturbances in houses. When this happens another candomblé specialist(candomblé is an African-influenced cult) is called in to dispel the maligninfluence. In fact, traditional magic through the ages has been based upon thisbelief in the use of spirits for magical purposes.Another modern investigator, Max Freedom Long, studied the Huna religion inHawaii, and became convinced that the Huna priests – known as kahunas – wereable to cause death by means of the “death prayer”. He writes:> The truth was that over a period of several years during which time I checked> the data through doctors frequenting the Queen’s Hospital in Honolulu, not a> year passed but one or more victims of the potent magic died, despite all the> hospital doctors could offer by way of aid.> > The kahunas, Long says, believe that man has three “selves” or souls, known asthe low self, the middle self and the high self. The low self correspondsroughly to what Freud called the unconscious; it controls man’s vital forces,and seems to be predominantly emotional. The middle self is man’s “ordinaryconsciousness”, his everyday self. The “high self” might be called thesuperconscious mind; it has powers that are unknown to the everyday self. Thesethree selves inhabit the body, and are separated from it after death. Butsometimes a “low self” may become detached from the other two. It becomes an“earthbound spirit” of the sort that causes poltergeist disturbances. The lowself, according to the kahunas, possesses memory, while the middle self doesnot. So a disembodied “middle self”, separated from the other two, is awandering wraith without memory – what we would regard as a ghost.According to Long, the “death prayer” involves disembodied “low spirits”, whoare highly susceptible to suggestion, and can easily be persuaded to obey. Thevictim of the death prayer experiences an increasing numbness as the spiritsdrain his vital energies.Long obtained much of his information about the kahunas (recorded in his bookThe Secret Science Behind Miracles) from a doctor, William Tufts Brigham, whohad studied them for many years. Brigham told him a typical story of the deathprayer. He had hired a party of Hawaians to climb a mountain, and afifteen-year-old boy became ill, experiencing a numbness that rose from hisfeet. He told Brigham that he was a victim of the death prayer. The kahuna inhis local village hated the influence of the white men, and declared that anyHawaian who worked for the whites would become a victim of the death prayer.When the boy accepted the job with Brigham the kahuna knew it by clairvoyance,and had invoked the death prayer.The Hawaians, who also believed that Brigham was a magician, asked him to try tosave the boy. Brigham decided to try. Acting upon the assumption that the ladwas being attacked by highly suggestible “lower spirits”, he stood over him andaddressed the attackers, flattering them and arguing that the boy was aninnocent victim, and telling them that it was the witch doctor who sent them whoought to be destroyed. He kept his mind concentrated on this idea for anotherhour, when suddenly the tension seemed to vanish and he experienced a sense ofrelief. The boy declared that he could now feel his legs again. When Brighamvisited the boy’s village he learned that the kahuna had died, after telling thevillagers that the “white magician” had redirected the spirits to attack him.Within hours of this he was dead. Brigham thought he had gone to sleep early,and awoke to find himself under attack, by which time it was too late.Long believes that the kahunas originated in Africa, possibly in Egypt. “Theirjourney commenced at the ‘Red Sea of Kane’, which fits neatly into the idea thatthey came from Egypt by way of the Red Sea”.The Egyptians also believed that man is a multiple being, a body animated byseveral spirits, the main ones being the ka or double (corresponding roughly towhat is sometimes called the “astral body”), the ba, or heart-soul, and the khu,or spiritual soul. There was also the ab (heart-soul), khaibit (shadow), sekhem(or vital force) and the ren, the man’s name.Long writes: ‘In Egypt, as we might expect . . . there are definite traces ofthe kahuna system to be found”, and he goes on to describe the Egyptian beliefsin some detail. He believes that the kahunas came to Hawaii by way of Egypt, andalso left traces of their system in the Hindu religion.The strange debilitating effects experienced by some of the archaeologistsincluding Carter sound in many ways like the effects of the death prayer asdescribed by Brigham and Long. But it is unnecessary to establish some directconnection between the kahunas of Hawaii and the religion of ancient Egypt. IfLong and Playfair are correct, and poltergeists or “low spirits” can be used formagical purposes, then it is logical to believe that they were used by thepriests of ancient Egypt as the “guardians of the tomb”.In A Search in Secret Egypt the English occultist Paul Brunton describes a nightspent in the King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid. He speaks of “a strangefeeling that I was not alone”, which developed into a feeling of beingsurrounded by “antagonistic beings”. “Monstrous elemental creations, evilhorrors of the underworld, forms of grotesque, insane, uncouth and fiendishaspect gathered around me . . . The end came with startling suddenness. Themalevolent ghostly invaders disappeared . . .” After this Brunton experienced afeeling that a benevolent being was present in the chamber, then thought that hesaw two high priests.Vandenberg, who quotes this, admits that it may all have been Brunton’simagination. But he goes on to describe how when he was visiting the pyramid in1972 a woman screamed, then collapsed and was unable to move. She said toVandenberg later: “It was as if something had suddenly hit me”. The guide toldVandenberg that such attacks were not unusual.If these odd effects are merely the result of imagination, then it is alsoarguable that the same applies to the curse of the pharaohs. After all,Carnarvon died of something that resembled a mosquito bite, others of heartattacks, others of circulatory failure – nothing that sounds like the creepingnumbness of the death curse. In a BBC programme on the curse of the pharaohs,Henry Lincoln, investigator of the mystery of Rennes-le-Château (q.v.), statedemphatically: “There never was a curse of the pharaohs”. It is certainly morecomfortable to think so."},{"pageContent":"12 The Devil’s FootprintsThe winter of 1855 was an exceptionally severe one, even in the southwest ofEngland, where winters are usually mild. On the morning of 8 February AlbertBrailsford, the principal of the village school in Topsham, Devon, walked out ofhis front door to find that it had snowed in the night. And he was intrigued tonotice a line of footprints – or rather hoofprints – that ran down the villagestreet. At first glance they looked like the ordinary hoofprints of a shodhorse; but a closer look showed that this was impossible, for the prints ran ina continuous line, one in front of the other. If it was a horse, then it musthave had only one leg, and hopped along the street. And if the unknown creaturehad two legs, then it must have placed one carefully in front of the other, asif walking along a tightrope. What was odder still was that the prints – eachabout four inches long – were only about eight inches apart. And each print wasvery clear, as if it had been branded into the frozen snow with a hot iron.The villagers of Topsham were soon following the track southward through thesnow. And they halted in astonishment when the hoofprints came to a halt at abrick wall. They were more baffled than ever when someone discovered that theycontinued on the other side of the wall, and that the snow on top of the wallwas undisturbed. The tracks approached a haystack, and continued on the otherside of it, although the hay showed no sign that a heavy creature had clamberedover it. The prints passed under gooseberry bushes, and were even seen onrooftops. It began to look as if some insane practical joker had decided to setthe village an insoluble puzzle.But it was soon clear that this explanation was also out of the question.Excited investigators tracked the prints for mile after mile over the Devoncountryside. They seemed to wander erratically through a number of small townsand villages – Lympstone, Exmouth, Teignmouth, Dawlish, as far as Totnes, abouthalfway to Plymouth. If it was a practical joker, he would have had to coverforty miles, much of it through deep snow. Moreover, such a joker would surelyhave hurried forward to cover the greatest distance possible; in fact, the stepsoften approached front doors, then changed their mind and went away again. Atsome point the creature had crossed the estuary of the river Exe – it looked asif the crossing was between Lympstone and Powderham. Yet there were alsofootprints in Exmouth, farther south, as if it had turned back on its tracks.There was no logic in its meandering course.In places it looked as if the “horseshoe” had a split in it, suggesting a clovenhoof. It was the middle of the Victorian era, and few country people doubted theexistence of the Devil. Men armed with guns and pitchforks followed the trail;when night came people locked their doors and kept loaded shotguns at hand.It was another week before the story reached the newspapers; on 16 February 1855the London Times told the story, adding that most gardens in Lympstone showedsome trace of the strange visitor. The following day the Plymouth Gazettecarried a report, and mentioned the theory of a clergyman that the creaturecould have been a kangaroo – apparently unaware that a kangaroo has claws. Areport in the Exeter Flying Post made the slightly more plausible suggestionthat it was a bird. But a correspondent in the Illustrated London News dismissedthis idea, pointing out that no bird leaves a horse-shoe-shaped print. He addedthat he had passed a five-month winter in the backwoods of Canada, and had neverseen a more clearly defined track.In the Illustrated London News for 3 March the great naturalist and anatomistRichard Owen announced dogmatically that the footmarks were those of hind footof a badger, and suggested that many badgers had come out of hibernation thatnight to seek food. He did not explain why all these badgers hopped along on onehind foot. (Five years later, he was to be equally dogmatic – and equally wrong– on the subject of Charles Darwin and the origin of species.) Anothercorrespondent, a doctor, described how he and another doctor “bestowedconsiderable time in endeavouring to discover the peculiarities of this mostsingular impression” (the Victorians loved this kind of pompous language). Heclaimed that “on more minute examination of the tracks, we could distinctly seethe impressions of the toes and pad of the foot of an animal”. His own candidatewas an otter. Another correspondent, who signed himself “Ornither”, was quitecertain that they were the prints of a Great Bustard, whose outer toes, heclaimed, were rounded. Another gentleman, from Sudbury, said he had recentlyseen impressions of rats surrounding a potato patch, and that they lookedexactly like the drawings of “the devil’s footprints”. He thought that the ratshad been leaping through the snow, landing with their full body weight andproducing a roughly horseshoe-shaped impression. A Scottish correspondentthought that the culprit could be a hare or polecat bounding through the snow.These suggestions are less absurd than they sound. They would certainly explainthe most baffling feature of the footprints – that they followed one uponanother, as if made by a one-legged animal. But they still fail to explain whythey continued for forty miles or so.Perhaps the likeliest hypothesis is one put forward by Geoffrey Household, whoedited a small book containing all the major correspondence on the matter.3[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2233865] He comments asfollows, in a letter to the author:> I think that Devonport dockyard released, by accident, some sort of> experimental balloon. It broke free from its moorings, and trailed two> shackles on the end of ropes. The impression left in the snow by these> shackles went up the sides of houses, over haystacks, etc. . . . A Major> Carter, a local man, tells me that his grandfather worked at Devonport at the> time, and that the whole thing was hushed up because the balloon destroyed a> number of conservatories, greenhouses, windows, etc. He says that the balloon> finally came down at Honiton.> > This information is fascinating, and could well represent the solution of themystery. But if so there is still one major anomaly to be explained. A glance atthe map of the “footprints” will show that they meandered in a kind of circlebetween Topsham and Exmouth. Would an escaped balloon drift around soerratically? Surely its route would tend to be a more or less straight line, inthe direction of the prevailing wind which, moreover, was blowing from the east.The fact that it took a week for the first report of the mystery to appear inprint means that certain vital clues have been lost for ever. It would beinteresting to know, for example, whether the snow that fell that night was thefirst snow of February 1855. It had been a hard winter that year, and many smallanimals, including rats, rabbits and badgers, must have been half starved byFebruary, and have been out looking for food. The letter to the Plymouth Gazette(dated 17 February) begins: “Thursday night, the 8th of February, was marked bya heavy fall of snow, followed by rain and boisterous wind from the east, and inthe morning frost”. Small animals had probably been out every night, but it wasnot until that Friday morning, with its fresh carpet of snow, that their trackswere noticed for the first time. Such tracks would have sunk deep into the softsnow, and would have been further deepened by the rain before they were frozensolid. This would explain why they seemed to be “branded” into the snow.[images/00002.jpg] But if the ground was already covered with snow before the night of 8 February,then one more plausible theory would have to be abandoned. And in any case itfails to explain how the tracks managed to wander over rooftops and haystacks .. . At this distance in time, the only certainty seems to be that the mystery isnow insoluble."},{"pageContent":"13 Was Philip K. Dick Possessed by an Angel?By the time of his death in March 1982, Philip K. Dick had become perhaps themost respected of modern science-fiction writers. The reason for this wasexpressed in an essay on Dick by Brian Stableford. “He has done more than anyoneelse to open up metaphysical questions to science fictional analysis”.4[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2234073]He was also, with the possible exception of H. P. Lovecraft, the most neuroticof major science-fiction writers, obsessed by the notion that human beings aretrapped in a web of unreality. His persecution mania developed to a point wherehe could undoubtedly have been described as a paranoid schizophrenic. Yet,toward the end of his life, Dick became convinced that he had been “taken over”by a kind of super-alien, who went on to reorganize his life. And althoughLawrence Sutin, in his full-length biography of Dick, Divine Invasions (1991),casts doubts on some of Dick’s claims, the case is too complex to be dismissedas simple self-delusion.Philip Kindred Dick was an oversensitive little boy whose childhood was notdesigned to make him buoyant and optimistic. His twin sister died soon after hisbirth – as a result, he was later convinced, of his mother’s neglect. He was alonely child; his mother was cold and, in Sutin’s words, “emotionallyconstrained”. She was often in pain and spent long periods bedridden – shesuffered from Bright’s disease. Dick himself suffered from asthma and had eatingand swallowing phobias. He was an introverted child who liked to retreat intodaydreams of cowboys; he resisted all of his father’s attempts to interest himin sports. His parents divorced when he was five. When he was nine, he and hismother moved to Berkeley, California, and Dick attended high school there. Hisrelationship with his mother, who was slim and pretty, had classic Freudianovertones; when he was a teenager he even had a dream that he was sleeping withher. He finally left home at nineteen – he claimed his mother threatened to callthe police to stop him – and moved into a bohemian rooming house populated bygay artists. From the age of fifteen he had worked in a local TV and recordstore and so was able to support himself.At nineteen Dick was still a virgin who had never even kissed a girl. Then oneof his customers – a short, overweight woman named Jeanette, who was ten yearshis senior – remedied the situation in a storeroom in the basement, and Dickdecided to marry her; she was the first of five wives. When they had beenmarried two months, Jeanette told him that she had a right to see other men; hedumped her possessions outside their apartment and changed the locks. His lovelife became sporadic and not particularly satisfying; one woman he fell in lovewith preferred his partner in the store; another went off with a lesbian.Another beautiful woman with whom he had an affair dropped him because he was sosocially inept. A nervous breakdown – accompanied by agoraphobia – led him toleave the University of California a year later. “I managed to becomeuniversally despised wherever I went”, he later told an interviewer. This ledhim, he said, to identify with the weak and to make the heroes in his storiesweak.From an early age Dick was obsessed by pain and misery. He records that when hewas four his father, who had fought on the Marne in World War I, told him aboutgas attacks and men with their guts blown out. And during World War II, when hewas still a child, he saw a newsreel showing a Japanese soldier who had been hitby a flamethrower and was “burning and running, and burning and running”, whilethe audience cheered and laughed. Dick wrote of the incident: “I was dazed withhorror . . . and I thought something is terribly wrong”. And in anautobiographical essay he wrote: “Human and animal suffering makes me mad;whenever one of my cats dies I curse God and I mean it; I feel fury at him. I’dlike to get him where I could interrogate him, tell him I think the world isscrewed up, that man didn’t sin and fall but was pushed”. Forced to kill a ratthat had been caught in a trap in his children’s bedroom, he was haunted for therest of his life by its screams. As a youngster, Dick had had an urge tocruelty, but after an incident in his childhood that involved tormenting abeetle, the urge suddenly vanished and was replaced by a sense of the oneness oflife – what he called satori: “I was never the same again”.Dick’s obsession with the problem of cruelty resembled that of the Russianwriter Dostoyevsky, whose Ivan Karamazov confesses that the cruelty andbrutality of the world makes him want to “give God back his entrance ticket”. Itis unsurprising, therefore, that Dick’s first science-fiction story, “BeyondLies the Wub”, concerned space explorers on an alien planet who buy a piglikecreature called a wub, which is delighted to discuss philosophy with them –while their only desire is to eat it. A later wub story describes how wub fur isused to bind books because it is self-repairing, though the fur causes the textsto alter. Thomas Paine’s Age of Reason vanishes completely – an expression ofDick’s feeling that it is an absurd form of hubris for human beings to believethey are rational creatures.From then on most of Dick’s work had a morbid, not to say paranoid, streak. In“Second Variety”, machines get out of hand and create duplicate humans to trapreal people. “The Imposter” is about a man who finds himself subjected to thenightmarish experience of being suspected of being a robot bomb; the final twistof the story is that it turns out to be true. (Dick’s early stories were heavilyinfluenced by the work of the older science-fiction writer, A. E. Van Vogt, whooften chooses such themes – e.g., a hero caught in a nightmare world ofapparently insane misunderstandings – although his basic outlook is optimistic.)There is a Kafkaesque quality to Dick’s work, which often features individualsbeset by endless complications that frustrate all attempts at purposeful action.Like so many modern writers – notably Arthur C. Clarke – Dick likes to play withthe idea of computers developing their own intelligence and taking over fromhuman beings. He is also inclined to experiment with the idea that the word“reality” is meaningless – that, instead, there are as many “realities” as thereare living creatures and that the notion of “reality” is therefore purelysubjective. This view, of course, leads easily to solipsism, the belief that youare the only person in the universe. After all, if the reality around us is“relative” and self-created, then perhaps other people are illusions we createto defend us from the recognition of our loneliness.One of Dick’s early novels, Eye in the Sky (1957), encapsulates his views about“reality”; a group of people find themselves in an “alternative reality” whereother people’s beliefs can become “reality”; a religious cult imposes its ownviews on everyone’s mind. They then realize that they are trapped in the insanereality of one of their own number. When they escape this illusion, theyimmediately find themselves entrapped in yet another. Their return to “reality”is a painful process in which they have to escape the “individual reality” ofevery member of the group. But in this early work Dick at least believes that a“return to reality” is possible. His later work becomes more darkly pessimistic,infused with the underlying conviction that there is no overall “reality”, onlyour individual illusions. This could be regarded as a dramatized version of thepessimistic philosophy of Schopenhauer and possibly that of Buddha.In 1963 Dick finally achieved relatively wide recognition with a novel entitledMan in the High Castle, which won the Hugo Award for best science-fiction novelof the year. It is another “alternative reality” novel, about a world in whichthe Allies lost the Second World War, with the result that America is dividedinto a German zone and a Japanese zone. A character named Tagomi has flashes ofan alternative reality in which the Allies won the war, but they seem absurd.Dick apparently plotted this novel with the aid of the I Ching, the Chinese bookof oracles; the result is a certain arbitrary quality. A later novel, DoAndroids Dream of Electric Sheep?, concerns an attempt by “real people” to rootout the robots that are trying to take over the earth and that are virtuallyindistinguishable from humans. (It was made into a successful film, BladeRunner.) All of Dick’s work seems to express his own sense of having anextremely insecure foundation in reality and his inability to cope with life. Hewrote, “For us . . . there can be no system. Maybe all systems . . . aremanifestations of paranoia. We should be content with the meaningless, thecontradictory, the hostile”.Meanwhile, Dick’s life lurched from crisis to crisis: nervous breakdowns,suicide attempts, divorces, novels written at top speed to stave off debt,paranoid delusions – at one point he saw a great metal face, with slots foreyes, looking down at him from the sky. His sexual relationships werereminiscent of those of the Swedish playwright Strindberg; again and again itlooked as if the lonely, fear-ridden writer had found peace when some attractivewoman thought that she could give him the security he needed. But hisfundamental instability wrecked every relationship. And his loneliness andparanoia brought about writer’s blocks. His biographer remarks, “If there is adominant mood to his novels of the late sixties, it is that of a dark night ofthe soul”. The novels themselves usually have a stifling, airless atmospherethat contrasts strongly with the wind of reality that seems to blow through thebest of Tolstoy or Hemingway.A quarrel he had with the science-fiction writer Harlan Ellison seems to embodyeverything that was wrong with Dick. At a science-fiction conference in Metz,France, Dick bewildered and bored his audience with a typically rambling speechentitled “If You Find This World Bad, You Should See Some of the Others”,Audience members suspected he was drunk or on drugs. (He was, in fact, addictedto numerous prescription drugs.) Dick and Ellison had parted company beforebecause Ellison felt Dick was unreliable and “possibly loony”. When they met inthe bar they engaged in a bitter philosophical debate that was basically aquarrel. Dick’s girlfriend at the time gives a memorable word-portrait of theencounter:> Phil was very antithetical to Harlan. Harlan is very cocky, glib, cool, and> here is Phil going clunk clunk clunk. Phil was not a very debonair or> self-assured man. Snuff falling out of his nose, ninety-two spots on his tie –> you know. And Harlan thought Phil treated people very badly because he> wandered away, got lost, had people support him rather than be master of his> own ship.> > Anyway, they got into this huge debate. Phil does very well in these kinds of> situations. Here is Harlan banging his chest, and Phil was more a philosopher.> Phil was just great – more dynamic and sexy than I’d ever seen him.> > Clearly, Dick could pull himself together and organize his ideas. Yet, asEllison realized, he preferred to “have people support him rather than be masterof his own ship”.But on 2 March 1974, Dick experienced a “vision” that transformed his life. Helater told an interviewer, Charles Platt, “My mental anguish was simply removedfrom me as if by a divine fiat . . . Some transcendent divine power, which wasnot evil, but benign, intervened to restore my mind and heal my body and give mea sense of the beauty, the joy, the sanity of the world”.In February 1974 Dick was convinced that he was being persecuted by bothAmerican and Soviet authorities; he was also convinced that he was destined todie the following month.One night, lying awake and wrestling with “dread and melancholy”, he began tosee whirling lights. A week later he again had visions but this time of“perfectly formed modern abstract paintings” – hundreds of thousands of themreplacing each other at dazzling speed. Then he experienced the “Bardo Thodoljourney” (an after-death journey, as described in the Tibetan Book of the Dead)and found himself face to face with the goddess Aphrodite. After this he beganhearing female voices as he hovered in hypnagogic states on the edge of sleep.On March 16 “it appeared – in vivid fire, with shining colours and balancedpatterns – and released me from every thrall, inner and outer”. Two days later“it, from inside me, looked out”. In other words, Dick now felt another beinginside himself; he was “possessed”. But the entity seemed benevolent: “It deniedthe reality, the power, the authenticity, of the world, saying, ‘This cannotexist; it cannot exist.’” Two days later: “It seized me entirely, lifting mefrom the limitations of the space-time matrix; it mastered me as, at the sameinstant, I knew that the world around me was cardboard, a fake. Through itspower I suddenly saw the universe as it was; through its perception I saw whatreally existed, and through its power of no-thought decision, I acted to freemyself”.All this sounds like the typical rambling of a psychotic. Yet what actually tookplace was by no means entirely in the realm of fantasy. Dick had a convictionthat he would receive a letter that would kill him. His wife, Tessa, confirmsthat one morning he selected a letter from a large batch of mail, handed it toher unopened, and told her that this was what he had been expecting. In fact, itwas a photocopy of a book review about the decline of American capitalism, andevery negative word, such as die, decline, decay, and decomposition, had beenunderlined. Paranoid or not, Dick seemed to have a sixth sense that enabled himto detect the strange letter unopened.Now, says Dick, he was taken over by the “intelligence”. “On Thursdays andSaturdays I would think it was God, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays I would think itwas extraterrestrial . . . It set about healing me physically, [as well as] myfour-year-old boy, who had an undiagnosed life-threatening birth defect that noone had been aware of”.The “intelligence”, which Dick called Valis (Vast Active Living IntelligenceSystem), fired information into his brain by means of pink light beams. It toldhim that his son, Christopher, suffered from a potentially fatal inguinalhernia. The Dicks checked with the doctor and found that the information wascorrect; the hernia was remedied by an operation.Dick told Charles Platt:> This mind was equipped with tremendous technical knowledge – engineering,> medical, cosmological, philosophical knowledge. It had memories dating back> over two thousand years, it spoke Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit, there wasn’t> anything that it didn’t seem to know.> > It immediately set about putting my affairs in order. It fired my agent and my> publisher. It remargined my typewriter. It was very practical; it decided that> the apartment had not been vacuumed recently enough; it decided that I should> stop drinking wine because of the sediment – it turned out I had an abundance> of uric acid in my system – and it switched me to beer. It made elementary> mistakes, such as calling the dog “he” and the cat “she” – which annoyed my> wife; and it kept calling her “ma’am”.> > His wife, Tessa, told Dick’s biographer, Lawrence Sutin, that she had no doubtof the genuineness of these “mystical” experiences. But she herself also hadreason to believe that there was some basis for her husband’s paranoia. Dickthought that the radio was transmitting programs in which a popular singercalled him names, told him he was worthless, and advised him to die. This soundslike a typical schizophrenic delusion. But Tessa herself verified that the radiowould go on at two in the morning and play music (she did not hear the voice);the odd thing was that the radio was unplugged.Dick goes on:> My wife was impressed by the fact that, because of the tremendous pressure> this mind put on people in my business, I made quite a lot of money very> rapidly. We began to get checks for thousands of dollars – money that was owed> me, which the mind was conscious existed in New York but had never been> coughed up. And it got me to the doctor who confirmed its diagnoses of the> various ailments I had . . . it did everything but paper the walls of the> apartment. It also said it would stay on as my tutelary spirit. I had to look> up “tutelary” to see what it meant.> > Sutin verifies that Dick galvanized his agent – the one he had fired for a time– into pursuing back royalties from Ace Books and that the agent was able tosend him a check for $3,000.Tessa also confirmed that Dick normally refused to go to the doctor but that the“spirit” insisted and that the doctor immediately had Dick check into a hospitalfor treatment of high blood pressure. He came out physically much improved. Hiswife wrote, “It made Phil more fun to be with. Every day brought an adventure”.And his experiences culminated in this insight: “This is not an evil world . . .There is a good world under the evil. The evil is somehow superimposed over it .. . and when stripped away, pristine, glowing creation is visible”.Dick’s life began to improve. He had always been poor. In 1974 he made $19,000,and in the following year, $35,000. As his reputation increased, so did demandsfor interviews, and an increasing number of his novels were translated intoforeign languages. Several books were optioned by Hollywood, and one of them, asmentioned earlier, became a classic movie, Blade Runner. When Dick died – of astroke and heart failure – in 1982, he had achieved cult status among thousandsof science-fiction fans and had become something of a legend.How far can we accept Dick’s own estimate of his “possession” experience? Hisbiographer, Lawrence Sutin, is obviously ambivalent about the subject. Yet thetitle of his book, Divine Invasions, indicates that he feels the experience tobe the most important in Dick’s life. His ambivalence is understandable. Dicksounds like a paranoid schizophrenic, and paranoid schizophrenics have“visions”. Yet there is enough factual evidence to suggest that Dick may nothave been suffering from delusions after all.The problem, of course, is that a rational human being finds it practicallyimpossible to believe in “possession” – except as a psychiatric label. Chapter42 in this book argues that such an attitude may not be as reasonable as itsounds. It depends upon the assumption that disembodied “spirits” cannot exist,and while no one will disagree that this is a perfectly sensible assumption fora rational and practical human being, we cannot assume that it is true for thatreason. And if we are willing even to admit the logical possibility of spirits,then we have also admitted the logical possibility of “possession”.An American psychiatrist, Wilson Van Dusen, found himself in this position,simply as a result of his work with mental patients at Mendocino State Hospitalin California. In a book entitled The Natural Depth in Man (1972), Van Dusendefined madness as “a turning in on one’s self that makes one a constricteduselessness that misses one’s highest potentials”. In other words, madness is alimitation of our natural potential – which inevitably raises the question: Whatis our natural potential? Van Dusen’s conclusion was that all human beings havethe potential to undergo “mystical” experiences, in which consciousness seems toexpand far beyond its normal limitations, and that therefore, in a certainsense, we are all “mad”.He went on to describe how he managed to establish contact with one of hispatient’s hallucinations. The girl had a phantom lover, and “just for the heckof it”, Van Dusen asked her to “report faithfully what [the lover] said anddid”. Van Dusen was thus able to hold “conversations” with the hallucination,using the patient as a go-between. He then found, to his surprise, that he wasable to give psychological tests to his patients and to their hallucinations,separately. He next made a startling and disturbing discovery: thehallucinations were sicker than the patients. That should have been quiteimpossible, since the hallucinations were the patients. Yet “what was revealedof the hallucinations looked remarkably like ancient accounts of spiritpossession”. There could be no doubt in Van Dusen’s mind that the hallucinationsbehaved like real people, and really replied to his remarks; for example, thepatient’s eyes would sometimes flash sideways as Van Dusen was talking and thehallucination interposed some remark.Patients often told stories of how they had come to “meet” their hallucinations:“One woman was just working in her garden and a kindly man started talking toher when no one else was around. One alcoholic heard voices coming up a hotellight well. Another man saw a spaceship land and green men getting out”. (Thisexperience is worth bearing in mind, when one considers so-called contactees offlying saucers; if Van Dusen is correct, these may not always behallucinations.) “It takes a while for the patient to figure out that he ishaving private experiences that are consequently not shared by others”.There was evidence that the “hallucinations” were not entirely subjective andunreal. One of the patients was a woman who had “murdered a rather uselesshusband”. The Virgin Mary had come to her in the hospital and advised her todrive to the southern part of the state and stand trial for murder. The Virgintold her there would be an earthquake on the day she left for the south andanother on the day she arrived. In fact, both earthquakes took place on cue.Van Dusen soon noted that there seemed to be two types of hallucinations, whichhe termed “higher order” and “lower order”. The lower order were stupider thanthe patient. They would lie, cheat, deceive, and threaten. They might repeat thesame word over and over again for days on end; they might tell the patient hewas useless and stupid and that they were going to kill him. They behaved, saysVan Dusen, like “drunken bums in a bar”.The “higher order”, on the other hand, were more intelligent and talented thanthe patient, and far from attacking him, they respected his freedom. They were“helpers”. In one case, Van Dusen was introduced by his patient – a “not verygifted gas fitter” – to a “beautiful lady” who referred to herself as theEmanation of the Feminine Aspect of the Divine and who seemed to have anincredible knowledge of religious symbols: “When I or the patient said somethingvery right, she would come over to us and hand us her panties”. One day VanDusen went home and spent the evening studying Greek myths. The next day heasked the “hallucination” about some of the obscurer parts. “She not onlyunderstood the myth, she saw into its human implications better than I did. Whenasked, she playfully wrote the Greek alphabet all over the place. The patientcouldn’t even recognize the letters, but he could copy hers for me”. As the gasfitter was leaving the room, he turned to Van Dusen and asked him to give him aclue as to what the conversation had been about.The detail of handing over the panties makes it sound as if, whatever Van Dusenthought, this hallucination was conjured up by the gas fitter – who admittedthat he had made “immoral” proposals to the woman and had been rejected. Yet herdescription of herself as the “Emanation of the Feminine Aspect of the Divine”offers an important clue. She was describing herself as the archetypal symbolicwoman, Goethe’s “eternal womanly”. For a male, the incredible essence of thefemale is that she is willing to give herself; the handing over of her pantiesmay be regarded as a singularly apt symbol for this essence.Van Dusen was fascinated to discover that the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg(1688–1772) had described the lower and higher orders with considerableaccuracy. They were, according to Swedenborg, “spirits”, and the lower orderwere earthbound spirits who were driven by malice or boredom. These tended tooutnumber the higher spirits by about four to one. Like Kardec (see chapter 26),Swedenborg commented that spirits could only “invade” people with whom they hadsome affinity – which probably explained why the low spirits outnumbered thehigh ones. Swedenborg referred to “high spirits” as angels and said that theirpurpose was to help; low spirits might be regarded as devils, yet their functionwas often – in spite of themselves – a helpful one, for they pointed out thepatient’s sins and shortcomings.Could Swedenborg have been mad? asks Van Dusen, and replies that there is noevidence for it whatever. What is odd is that his high and low spirits are notconfined to Christian mental homes; they transcend cultural barriers and can befound just as frequently among Muslim or Hindu lunatics.Van Dusen reaches the interesting conclusion that “the spiritual world is muchas Swedenborg described it, and is the unconscious”.If he is correct, and the “spirit world” lies inside us – as another remarkablemystic, Rudolf Steiner, asserted – then we can begin to see why mental patientsmight experience hallucinations. They might have “opened” themselves to theirown depths, to the curious denizens of those regions.When Philip K. Dick’s strange experiences are considered in the light of thesecomments, it becomes clear that it is impossible to dismiss him as a paranoidschizophrenic. We must at least be willing to leave open the possibility that hewas aware – as expressed in the title of Wilson Van Dusen’s second book – of“the presence of other worlds”."},{"pageContent":"14 The Dogon and the Ancient AstronautsEvidence of Visitors from Space?The theory that the earth has been visited, perhaps even colonized, by beingsfrom outer space has been a part of popular mythology since Stanley Kubrick’scult movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (written by Arthur C. Clarke), came out in1968. But it had already been “in the air” for many years – in fact, since 1947,when a businessman named Kenneth Arnold, who was flying his private plane nearMount Rainier, in Washington, reported seeing nine shining disks traveling at anestimated speed of one thousand miles an hour. Soon “UFO” sightings were beingreported from all over the world – far too many and too precise to be dismissedas pure fantasy.In 1958, in a book entitled The Secret Places of the Lion, a “contactee” namedGeorge Hunt Williamson advanced the theory that visitors from space had arrivedon earth 18 million years ago and had since been devoting themselves to helpingmankind evolve. It was they who built the Great Pyramid. Perhaps because it isso full of references to the Bible, Williamson’s book made little impact.In 1960 there appeared in France a book entitled The Morning of the Magicians(Le Matin des Magiciens) by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, which became aninstant bestseller and which may claim the dubious credit of having initiatedthe “occult boom” of the 1960s. (Before that the fashion was for politicalrebellion with a strong Marxist flavor.) Its success was largely due to itssuggestion that Hitler may have been involved in black magic, but it alsoincluded speculations about the Great Pyramid, the statues of Easter Island,Hans Hoerbiger’s theory that the moon is covered with ice (soon to be disprovedby the moon landings), and the reality of alchemical transformation. Fictionwriters like Arthur Machen, H. P. Lovecraft, and John Buchan are discussedalongside Einstein and Jung. And there is, inevitably, a section on the famousPiri Re’is map (see chapter 49), in which the authors succeed in mixing up thesixteenth-century pirate Piri Re’is with a Turkish naval officer who presented acopy of the map to the Library of Congress in 1959. They conclude thediscussion: “Were these copies of still earlier maps? Had they been traced fromobservations made on board a flying machine or space vessel of some kind? Notestaken by visitors from Beyond”?These speculations caused excitement because the world was in the grip offlying-saucer mania. Books by people who claimed to be “contactees” – likeGeorge Adamski – became best-sellers. And while many “sightings” could bedismissed as hysteria – or as what Jung called “projections” (meaning religiousdelusions) – a few were too well authenticated to fit that simplistic theory.In 1967 a Swiss writer named Erich von Däniken eclipsed The Morning of theMagicians with a book entitled Memories of the Future. Translated into Englishas Chariots of the Gods?, it soon sold more than a million copies. This work wasalso devoted to the thesis that visitors from space had landed on earth when menwere still living in caves and had been responsible for many ancient monuments,such as the Great Pyramid, the Easter Island statues, the Nazca lines drawn inthe sand of southern Peru (he suggested they were runways for spaceships), andthe step pyramids of South America.But von Däniken’s almost wilful carelessness quickly led to his being soondiscredited. Perhaps the most obvious example of this carelessness was histreatment of Easter Island. Von Däniken alleged that the island’s gigantic stonestatues – some of them twenty feet high – could only have been carved anderected with the aid of sophisticated technology, which would have been farbeyond the resources of primitive savages. In fact, the Norwegian explorer ThorHeyerdahl persuaded modern Easter Islanders to carve and erect statues withtheir own “primitive technology”. Von Däniken had also pointed out that EasterIsland has no wood for rollers – unaware that only a few centuries ago, theisland was covered with woodland and that the Easter Islanders had beenresponsible for the destruction of their own environment.Most of von Däniken’s other arguments proved equally vulnerable. He had insistedthat a stone tablet – known as the Palenque tablet – from Chiapas, Mexico,depicted a “spaceman” about to blast off. Archaeologists who had studied thereligion of ancient Mexico demonstrated that what von Däniken mistook forinstruments of space technology were traditional Mexican religious symbols. VonDäniken’s assertions about the pyramids proved equally fanciful and uninformed.He asked how such monuments could have been constructed without the aid of ropesand managed to overstate the weight of the Great Pyramid by a multiple of five.Experts on the pyramids pointed out that ancient paintings show the Egyptiansusing ropes and were able to prove that ancient Egyptian engineers were moreknowledgeable than von Däniken realized. As to the famous Nazca lines, itrequired no expert to see that lines drawn in the sand – even if made of smallpebbles – would soon be blasted away by any kind of spacecraft coming in toland. In fact, the purpose of the Nazca lines – like that of all ancientfertility ceremonies – seems to have been to control the weather.Much of von Däniken’s literary evidence is equally dubious. He discusses theAssyrian Epic of Gilgamesh (getting the date of its discovery wrong) anddescribes how the sun-god Enkidu bore the hero Gilgamesh upward in his claws “sothat his body felt as heavy as lead” – which to von Däniken suggests an ascentin a space rocket. The tower of the goddess Ishtar – visited by the hero – isalso, according to von Däniken, a space rocket. A door “that spoke like a livingperson” is obviously a loudspeaker. And so on. Anyone who takes the trouble tocheck the Epic of Gilgamesh – readily available in a paperback translation –will discover that none of these episodes actually occurs.But the von Däniken bubble finally burst in 1972 when, in Gold of the Gods, theauthor claimed to have visited a vast underground cave system in Ecuador, withelabourately engineered walls, and examined an ancient library engraved on metalsheets. When his fellow explorer, Juan Moricz, denied that von Däniken had evenventured into the caves, von Däniken admitted that his account was fictional,but argued that his book was not intended to be a scientific treatise; since itwas designed for popular consumption, he had allowed himself a certain degree ofpoetic license. Yet in a biography of von Däniken, Peter Krassa ignores thisadmission, insisting that the case is still open and that von Däniken may havebeen telling the truth after all. But Krassa has a skillful technique of makingan admission and then quickly taking it back again. He concludes: “Of course hisreport was mad, and untrue; this story about underground caverns; hisdescription of the golden treasure to be found there was a lie. This was thejudgment of many scientists and journalists”.In fact, a British expedition to the caves found them to be natural, withevidence of habitation by primitive man but no signs of von Däniken’s ancientlibrary or perfectly engineered walls. A two-hour TV exposé of von Dänikensubsequently punctured every one of his major claims.Having said which, it must be admitted that von Däniken and other “ancientastronaut” theorists have at least one extremely powerful piece of evidence ontheir side. Members of an African tribe called the Dogon, who live in theRepublic of Mali, some 300 miles south of Timbuktu, insist that they possessknowledge that was transmitted to them by “spacemen” from the star Sirius, whichis 8.7 light-years away. Dogon mythology insists that the “Dog Star” Sirius (socalled because it is in the constellation Canis) has a dark companion that isinvisible to the naked eye and that is dense and very heavy. This is correct;Sirius does indeed have a dark companion known as Sirius B.The existence of Sirius B had been suspected by astronomers since themid-nineteenth century, and it was first observed in 1862 – although it was notdescribed in detail until the 1920s. Is it possible that some white travelertook the knowledge of Sirius B to Africa sometime since the 1850s? It ispossible but unlikely. Two French anthropologists, Marcel Griaule and GermaineDieterlen, first revealed the “secret of the Dogon” in an obscure paper in 1950;it was entitled “A Sudanese Sirius System” and was published in the Journal dela Société des Africainistes.The two anthropologists had lived among the Dogon since 1931, and in 1946Griaule was initiated into the religious secrets of the tribe. He was told thatfishlike creatures called the Nommo had come to Earth from Sirius to civilizeits people. Sirius B, which the Dogon call po tolo (naming it after the seedthat forms the staple part of their diet, and whose botanical name isDigitaria), is made of matter heavier than any on earth and moves in anelliptical orbit, taking fifty years to do so. It was not until 1928 that SirArthur Eddington postulated the theory of “white dwarfs” – stars whose atomshave collapsed inward, so that a piece the size of a pea could weigh half a ton.(Sirius B is the size of the earth yet weighs as much as the sun.) Griaule andDieterlen went to live among the Dogon three years later. Is it likely that sometraveler carried a new and complex scientific theory to a remote African tribein the three years between 1928 and 1931?An oriental scholar named Robert Temple went to Paris to study the Dogon withGermaine Dieterlen. He soon concluded that the knowledge shown by the Dogoncould not be explained away as coincidence or “diffusion” (knowledge passed onthrough contact with other peoples). The Dogon appeared to have anextraordinarily detailed knowledge of our solar system. They said that the moonwas “dry and dead”, and they drew Saturn with a ring around it (which, ofcourse, is only visible through a telescope). They knew that the planetsrevolved around the sun. They knew about the moons of Jupiter (first seenthrough a telescope by Galileo). They had recorded the movements of Venus intheir temples. They knew that the earth rotates and that the number of stars isinfinite. And when they drew the elliptical orbit of Sirius, they showed thestar off-centre, not in the middle of the orbit – as someone without knowledgeof astronomy would naturally conclude.The Dogon insist that their knowledge was brought to them by the amphibiousNommo from a “star” (presumably they mean a planet) which, like Sirius B,rotates around Sirius and whose weight is only a quarter of Sirius B’s. Theyworshiped the Nommo as gods. They drew diagrams to portray the spinning of thecraft in which these creatures landed and were precise about the landinglocation – the place to the northwest of present Dogon country, where the Dogonoriginated. They mention that the “ark” in which the Nommo arrived caused awhirling dust storm and that it “skidded”. They speak of “a flame that went outas they touched the earth”, which implies that they landed in a small spacecapsule. Dogon mythology also mentions a glowing object in the sky like a star,presumably the mother ship.Our telescopes have not yet revealed the “planet” of the Nommo, but that ishardly surprising. Sirius B was only discovered because its weight causedperturbations in the orbit of Sirius. The Dog Star is 35.5 times as bright (andhot) as our sun, so any planet capable of supporting life would have to be inthe far reaches of its solar system and would almost certainly be invisible totelescopes. Temple surmises that the planet of the Nommo would be hot and steamyand that this probably explains why intelligent life evolved in its seas, whichwould be cooler. These fish-people would spend much of their time on land butclose to the water; they would need a layer of water on their skins to becomfortable, and if their skins dried, it would be as agonizing as severesunburn. Temple sees them as a kind of dolphin.But what were such creatures doing in the middle of the desert, near Timbuktu?In fact, the idea is obviously absurd. Temple points out that to the northwestof Mali lies Egypt, and for many reasons, he is inclined to believe that thelanding of the Nommo took place there.Temple also points out that a Babylonian historian named Berossus – acontemporary and apparently an acquaintance of Aristotle (fourth century BC) –claims in his history, of which only fragments survive, that Babyloniancivilization was founded by alien amphibians, the chief of whom is called Oannes– the Philistines knew him as Dagon (and the science-fiction writer H. P.Lovecraft borrowed him for his own mythology). The Greek grammarian Apollodorus(about 140 BC) had apparently read more of Berossus, for he criticizes anotherGreek writer, Abydenus, for failing to mention that Oannes was only one of the“fish people”; he calls these aliens “Annedoti” (“repulsive ones”) and says theyare “semi-demons” from the sea.But why should the Dogon pay any particular attention to Sirius, even though itwas one of the brightest stars in the sky? After all, it was merely one amongthousands of stars. There, at least, the skeptics can produce a convincinganswer. Presumably, the Dogon learned from the Egyptians, and for the ancientEgyptians, Sothis (as they called Sirius) was the most important star in theheavens – at least, after 3200 BC, when it began to rise just before the dawn,at the beginning of the Egyptian New Year, and signaled that the Nile was aboutto rise.So the Dog Star became the god of rising waters. The goddess Sothis wasidentified with Isis; and Temple points out that in Egyptian tomb paintings,Isis is usually to be found in a boat with two fellow goddesses, Anukis andSatis. Temple argues convincingly that this indicates that the Egyptians knewSirius to be a three-star system – the unknown “Sirius C” being the home of theNommo. An ancient Arabic name for one of the stars in the Sirius constellation(not Sirius itself) is Al Wazn, meaning “weight”, and one text says that it isalmost too heavy to rise over the horizon.Temple suggests that the ancients may have looked toward the Canis constellationfor Sirius B and mistaken it for Al Wazn. He also suggests that Homer’s Sirens –mermaidlike creatures who are all-knowing and who try to lure men away fromtheir everyday responsibilities – are actually “Sirians”, amphibious goddesses.He also points out that Jason’s boat, the Argo, is associated with the goddessIsis and that it has fifty rowers – fifty being the number of years it takesSirius B to circle Sirius A. There are many other fish-bodied aliens in Greekmythology, including the Telchines of Rhodes, who were supposed to have comefrom the sea and to have introduced men to various arts, including metalwork.Significantly, they had dogs’ heads.But if the Egyptians knew about Sirius B and the Nommo, then why do we not haveEgyptian texts that tell us about aliens from the Dog Star system? Here theanswer is obvious: Marcel Griaule had to be “initiated” by Dogon priests beforehe was permitted to learn about the visitors from Sirius. If the Egyptians knewabout Sirius B, the knowledge was revealed only to initiates. But it would haveleft its mark in Egyptian mythology – for example, in the boat of Isis.Temple’s book The Sirius Mystery (1976) is full of such mythological “evidence”,and much of it has been attacked for stretching interpretation too far. Yet whatremains when all the arguments have been considered is the curious fact that aremote African tribe has some precise knowledge of an entire star system notvisible to the human eye alone and that they attribute this knowledge to aliensfrom that star system. That single fact suggests that in spite of von Däniken’sabsurdities, we should remain open-minded about the possibility that alienvisitors once landed on our planet."},{"pageContent":"15 The Mystery of Eilean MoreThe Island of Disappearing MenIn the empty Atlantic, seventeen miles to the west of the Hebrides, lie theFlannan Islands, known to seafarers as the Seven Hunters. The largest and mostnortherly of these is called Eilean More – which means in fact “big island”.Like the Mary Celeste, its name has become synonymous with an apparentlyinsoluble mystery of the sea.These bleak islands received their name from a seventh-century bishop, StFlannan, who built a small chapel on Eilean More. Hebridean shepherds oftenferried their sheep over to the islands to graze on the rich turf; but theythemselves would never spend a night there, for the islands are supposed to behaunted by spirits and by “little folk”. In the last decades of the nineteenthcentury, as Britain’s sea trade increased, many ships sailing north or southfrom Clydebank were wrecked on the Flannans, and in 1895 the Northern LighthouseBoard announced that a lighthouse would be built on Eilean More. They expectedconstruction to take two years; but rough seas, and the problems of hoistingstones and girders up a 200-foot cliff, made it impossible to stick to theschedule; Eilean More lighthouse was finally opened in December 1899. For thenext year its beam could be seen reflected on the rough seas between Lewis andthe Flannans. Then, eleven days before Christmas 1900, the light went out.The weather was too stormy for the Northern Lighthouse Board steamer to go andinvestigate, even though the lighthouse had been built with two landing-stages,one to the west and one to the east, so one of them would always be shelteredfrom the prevailing wind. Joseph Moore, waiting on the seafront at Loch Roag,had a sense of helplessness as he stared westward towards the Flannans. It wasinconceivable that all three men on Eilean More – James Ducat, Donald McArthurand Thomas Marshall – could have fallen ill simultaneously, and virtuallyimpossible that the lighthouse itself could have been destroyed by the storms.On Boxing Day, 1900, the dawn was clear and the sea less rough. The Hesperusleft harbour soon after daylight; Moore was so anxious that he refused to eatbreakfast, pacing the deck and staring out towards the islands; the mystery hadtormented him, and now he was too excited to take food.The swell was still heavy, and the Hesperus had to make three approaches beforeshe was able to moor by the eastern jetty. No flags had answered their signals,and there was no sign of life.Moore was the first to reach the entrance gate. It was closed. He cupped hishands and shouted, then hurried up the steep path. The main door was closed, andno one answered his shouts. Like the Mary Celeste, the lighthouse was empty. Inthe main room the clock had stopped, and the ashes in the fireplace were cold.In the sleeping quarters upstairs – Moore waited until he was joined by twoseamen before he ventured upstairs, afraid of what he might find there – thebeds were neatly made, and the place was tidy.James Ducat, the chief keeper, had kept records on a slate. The last entry wasfor 15 December at 9 a.m., the day the light went out. But this had not been forlack of oil; the wicks were trimmed and the lights all ready to be lit.Everything was in order. So it was clear that the men had completed their basicduties for the day before tragedy struck them; when evening came there had beenno one on the island to light the lamp. But the 15th of December had been a calmday . . .The Hesperus returned to Lewis with the men’s Christmas presents still on board.Two days later investigators landed on Eilean More, and tried to reconstructwhat had happened. At first it looked as if the solution was quitestraightforward. On the westward jetty there was evidence of gale damage; anumber of ropes were entangled round a crane which was sixty-five feet abovesea-level. A tool chest kept in a crevice forty-five feet above this wasmissing. It looked as if a hundred-foot wave had crashed in from the Atlanticand swept it away, as well as the three men. The fact that the oilskinsbelonging to Ducat and Marshall were missing seemed to support this theory; theyonly wore them to visit the jetties. So the investigators had a plausibletheory. The two men had feared that the crane was damaged in the storm; they hadstruggled to the jetty in their oilskins, then been caught by a sudden huge wave. . . But in that case, what had happened to the third man, Donald McArthur,whose oilskins were still in the lighthouse? Had he perhaps rushed out to try tosave them and been swept away himself?All these theories came crashing when someone pointed out that the 15th had beena calm day; the storms had not started until the following day. Then perhapsDucat had simply entered the wrong date by mistake? That theory also had to beabandoned when, back at Loch Roag, Captain Holman of the Archer told them he hadpassed close to the islands on the night of the 15th, and that the light wasalready out . . .Then what if the three men had been on the jetty on a calm morning – which wouldexplain why McArthur was not wearing his oilskins – and one of them had slippedinto the water? Perhaps the other two had jumped in after him and been drowned.But then there were ropes and lifebelts on the jetty – why should men leap intothe water when they only had to throw in a lifebelt?Suppose the drowning man was unconscious, and could not grab a lifebelt? In thatcase only one of his companions would have jumped in after him, leaving theother on the jetty with a rope . . .Another theory was that one of the three men had gone insane and pushed theothers to their deaths, then thrown himself into the sea. It is just possible;but there is not the slightest shred of evidence for it.The broadcaster Valentine Dyall – the “Man in Black” – suggested the mostplausible explanation in his book Unsolved Mysteries. In 1947 a Scottishjournalist named Iain Campbell visited Eilean More on a calm day, and wasstanding near the west landing when the sea suddenly gave a heave, and roseseventy feet over the jetty. Then, after about a minute, it subsided back tonormal. It could have been some freak of the tides, or possibly an underwaterearthquake. Campbell was convinced that anyone on the jetty at that time wouldhave been sucked into the sea. The lighthouse keeper told him that this curious“upheaval” occurs periodically, and that several men had almost been draggedinto the sea.But it is still hard to understand how three men could be involved in such anaccident. Since McArthur was not wearing his oilskins, we can presume he was inthe tower when it happened – if it happened. Even if his companions were sweptaway, would he be stupid enough to rush down to the jetty and fling himself intothe sea?Only one thing is clear: that on that calm December day at the turn of thecentury, some accident snatched three men off Eilean More, and left not even ashred of a clue to the mystery."},{"pageContent":"16 FairiesAre the “Little People” Just a Fairy Tale?In the summer of 1897 the poet W. B. Yeats went to stay at Coole Park, inGalway, with Lady Augusta Gregory, who was to become his close friend andpatroness, and the two of them began collecting fairy stories from the localpeasantry. Yeats had already compiled two collections of Irish myths and fairytales by interviewing peasants in his home county of Sligo. But he now came torecognize that the majority of Irish country folk accepted the existence offairies, not as some kind of half-believed superstition – like touching wood –but as a concrete fact of life.Yeats’s father was a total skeptic, and Yeats himself had been inclined to toywith a belief in fairies as a kind of reaction to the materialism of the modernworld – in short, as a kind of wishful thinking. His collabouration with LadyGregory made him aware that belief in fairies could hardly be dismissed aswishful thinking. G. K. Chesterton, who met him several years later, wasimpressed by his insistence on the factual reality of fairies and wrote of Yeatsin his autobiography.> He was the real original rationalist who said that the fairies stand to> reason. He staggered the materialists by attacking their abstract materialism> with a completely concrete mysticism; “Imagination”! he would say with> withering contempt; “There wasn’t much imagination when Farmer Hogan was> dragged out of bed and thrashed like a sack of potatoes – that they did, they> had ’um out”; the Irish accent warming with scorn; “they had ’um out and> thumped ’um; and that’s not the sort of thing that a man wants to imagine”.> > Chesterton goes on to make a very important point:> It is the fact that it is not abnormal men like artists, but normal men like> peasants, who have borne witness a thousand times to such things; it is the> farmers who see the fairies. It is the agricultural labourer who calls a spade> a spade who also calls a spirit a spirit; it is the woodcutter with no axe to> grind . . . who will say he saw a man hang on the gallows, and afterwards hang> round it as a ghost.> > A few years later Yeats was to encourage the orientalist W. Y. Evans Wentz –best known for his translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead – to study thefolklore of the fairies; the result was Wentz’s first book, The Fairy Faith inCeltic Countries (1911), a bulky and scholarly volume based upon his ownextensive field-work. Yeats’s friend, the poet AE (George Russell), contributedan anonymous piece to the book (under the title “An Irish Mystic’s Testimony”)in which he described his own fairy sightings with the factual accuracy andprecision of an anthropologist describing primitive tribes: shining beings,opalescent beings, water beings, wood beings, lower elementals:> The first of [the fairies] I saw I remember very clearly . . .: there was> first a dazzle of light, and then I saw that this came from the heart of a> tall figure with a body apparently shaped out of half-transparent or> opalescent air, and throughout the body ran a radiant electrical fire, to> which the heart seemed the centre. Around the head of this being and through> its waving luminous hair, which was blown all about the body like living> strands of gold, there appeared flaming wing-like auras. From the being itself> light seemed to stream outwards in every direction; and the effect left on me> after the vision was one of extraordinary lightness, joyousness or ecstasy.> > Wentz concludes that the factual and scientific evidence for the existence offairies is overwhelming, that in fact, “there are hundreds of proven cases ofphenomena”.But AE’s fairies were essentially “visions” and could therefore be classifiedwith unicorns or centaurs. In 1920, nine years after Wentz’s book appeared, theBritish public was intrigued to learn of new scientific evidence that seemed toplace belief in “the little people” on an altogether more solid foundation. Thefront cover of the Christmas issue of the Strand magazine announced: “AnEpoch-Making Event . . . Described by Conan Doyle”. Facing the opening page ofthe article was a photograph of a teenage girl in a white cotton dress, sittingin a grassy field and holding out her hand to a dancing gnome. Anotherphotograph showed a younger girl gazing mildly into the camera over a group offour cavorting fairies, complete with gossamer wings. The caption under thefirst photograph stated: “This picture and the even more extraordinary one offairies on page 465 are the two most astounding photographs ever published. Howthey were taken is fully described in Sir A. Conan Doyle’s article”.It was not a seasonal joke. Doyle and his fellow investigators were convincedthat the two photographs virtually proved the existence of “the little people”.The resulting controversy was to remain unsettled for the next sixty years.The girls in the photograph were Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths, and theylived in the village of Cottingley, in Yorkshire. They had taken the photographsthree and a half years earlier, in the summer of 1917, and had consistentlyclaimed, often in the face of extremely skeptical cross-examination, that thephotographs were of real fairies.The village of Cottingley is situated near Bradford, although it has today beenswallowed up by suburbs. In 1917 it was surrounded by green English countryside.It was in April of that year that ten-year-old Frances Griffiths had moved tothe village with her mother, Annie, from South Africa; her father was fightingin France. She later claimed that she soon realized there were fairies in thefields around her home, especially near the local beck (stream), which ran downa steep-sided dell at the bottom of her garden. She later described the firsttime she said she had seen a fairy down by the stream.> One evening after school I went down to the beck to a favourite place – the> willow overhanging the stream . . . then a willow leaf started shaking> violently – just one. I’d seen it happen before – there was no wind, and it> was odd that one leaf should shake . . . as I watched, a small man, all> dressed in green, stood on the branch with the stem of the leaf in his hand,> which he seemed to be shaking at something he was looking at. I daren’t move> for fear of frightening him. He looked straight at me and disappeared.> > But she had decided not to tell anyone for fear of being laughed at.She explained how, as the summer wore on, she had become increasingly fascinatedby the stream and how she would spend hours “fairy-watching” in the dell. Sheoccasionally missed her footing on the slippery bank and landed up to her waistin the water. When she returned home her mother would slap her and make herpromise not to go near the stream, but Frances never kept her promise – shecould not resist the urge to see the fairies.One day, when she arrived home soaked yet again, her mother and her Aunt Pollypressed hard for an explanation. What they heard left them both slightlybreathless: “I go to see the fairies! That’s why – to see the fairies”!At this point, to the surprise of the two women, Frances’s cousin,seventeen-year-old Elsie Wright, came to her defense and insisted that she, too,had seen fairies. No amount of questioning could shake the girls’ story.According to Doyle’s article, it was this confrontation that convinced the twocousins that they must produce some indisputable evidence to make the grown-upseat their words.That is why, on a Saturday afternoon in July 1917, Elsie asked her father,Arthur Wright, if she could borrow his plate camera. He was understandablyreluctant, since the camera was new and the plates expensive, but he eventuallygave way. The girls hurried off to the stream and were back in half an hour.After tea Arthur was coaxed into developing the plate.As the plate started to develop, he realized that it was a picture of Francesleaning on a bank that seemed to be scattered with sandwich papers. Then, to hisamazement, he saw that the “papers” were tiny human forms with wings growingfrom their backs; they were apparently four dancing fairies.The girls’ mothers didn’t know what to think. Both had recently becomeinterested in Theosophy – the movement founded by Madame Blavatsky, who taughtthat behind the solid world of everyday reality there was an invisible worldpeopled with spiritual beings, including nature spirits or fairies. In theory,at any rate, they agreed.Arthur Wright, on the other hand, was skeptical:“You’ve been up to summat”.“No we haven’t”, Elsie insisted.He knew that Elsie was a gifted artist and was convinced that the fairies werepaper cutouts – although a search of the girls’ room and the wastebaskets failedto turn up any snippets of paper left over from manufactured fairies. And inspite of all their protestations, he remained unconvinced. Eventually, thematter was dropped. But in August the girls borrowed the camera again; this timethey returned with a picture of Elsie sitting in a field watching a dancinggnome. They explained that they often saw gnomes in the field just above thestream. After this, in the interest of peace and quiet, Arthur Wright refusedfurther loans of his camera. But several prints were made of each plate.The whole affair might have been forgotten if it had not been for theTheosophical Society. After the war, with its appalling casualties, Spiritualismand Theosophy had made thousands of new converts, and the Bradford Unity Hall,where the Society held its meetings, was always packed.After a meeting in which fairies had been mentioned, Polly Wright approached thespeaker and told him about the photographs. He asked to see them, and copieswere soon circulating among the Bradford Theosophists.Shortly afterward Polly Wright received a letter from Edward L. Gardner, head ofthe Theosophist Lodge in London; he was excited about the photographs and askedto see the original prints and negatives. Upon receiving the negatives, Gardnerhad them copied and the copies then retouched. He was quite open about this; ina letter to Doyle he wrote:> I begged the loan of the actual negatives – and two quarter plates came by> post a few days after. One was a fairly clear one, the other much under> exposed . . . the immediate upshot was that a positive was taken from each> negative, that the originals might be preserved untouched, and then new> negatives were prepared and intensified to service as better printing mediums.> > He then took the original prints and negatives to a professional photographer,Harold Snelling. Snelling’s previous employer had assured Gardner that “whatSnelling doesn’t know about faked photography isn’t worth knowing”.It was Snelling who examined the four-dancing-fairies negative (thebetter-exposed plate). He reported to Gardner:> This plate is a single exposure . . . These dancing fairies are not made of> paper nor of any fabric; they are not painted on a photographed background –> but what gets me most is that all these figures have moved during exposure.> > Gardner, delighted with this verdict, began showing lantern slides of thephotographs at Theosophy meetings around the country. And in the summer of 1920he was flattered to receive a letter from the creator of Sherlock Holmes.The sixty-year-old Doyle was not a Theosophist, but in recent years he hadbecome convinced of the truth of Spiritualism. He had already been commissionedby the Strand to write an article on fairies, and the news of the Cottingleyphotographs must have sounded like a gift from the beyond. When he saw thephotographs, Doyle was at first skeptical about them. But a meeting with Gardnerconvinced him that they could be genuine. The next step, obviously, was to tryto obtain more of them.Toward the end of July 1920 Edward Gardner went to visit the Wrights for thefirst time – Frances was then in Scarborough with her father and so was notpresent. Elsie’s father made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was unhappyabout the whole situation. He still felt that the photographs were fakes, andthe high esteem in which he held Doyle had declined sharply when he heard thatDoyle was now convinced “by our Elsie, and her at the bottom of her class”!But his wife had a long and thoughtful talk with Gardner, and Elsie later showedhim the field, and the spot by the stream where the photographs had been taken.Some people had felt that the stream photograph looked a little too “magical” tobe true, with its little toadstools and waterfall; Gardner was delighted to findthat it looked exactly as in the photograph. He reported to Doyle that he wasconvinced that the girls were genuine. Doyle still felt that more photographswere needed to prove the case. So, as Doyle embarked on a steamship south toAustralia to lecture on Spiritualism, Gardner went north again; this time armedwith new cameras and two dozen carefully numbered plates. (Oddly enough, nobodybothered to note how many plates were eventually used by the girls, so thenumbering was wasted.)On this occasion Gardner also met Frances, then fourteen, who had returned fromScarborough for the summer holidays. He soon formed the conviction that bothgirls were psychic. Since the weather was rainy and dull – bad visibility forfairly-spotting, according to the girls – he left the cameras behind andreturned to London. The rain continued for the next two weeks.The morning of August 19 was dull and misty, but when it brightened up later,the girls decided to try out the cameras. They returned with two morephotographs, which were promptly developed by the unbelieving Arthur Wright. Onewas of a winged fairy, with stylish-looking bobbed hair, standing placidly on abranch, offering Elsie a tiny bunch of harebells. The other was of a slightlyblurred Frances jerking her head back as another winged fairy leapt toward her.It was clear that it was leaping rather than flying because the wings wereunblurred by movement. Gardner later had these photographs examined by anexpert, who again reported that they showed no signs of fraud.The last photograph was taken on a drizzly day, 21 August 1920. Later referredto by Frances as a “fairy sunbath”, it seems to show two fairies hanging agossamerlike material over a tuft of grass, to make a shelter or suntrap.Frances said she often saw the little people doing this on dull days, as if tokeep themselves warm. Oddly enough, this phenomenon has been reported in variousunconnected fairy sightings before and after the Cottingley photographs. Thefairies in this last photograph have a semi-transparent quality, whichdetractors claimed was a sign of double exposure but which believers ascribed tothe effect of cold on the fairy constitution.Since Doyle had written the Strand article before he left for Australia, it madeno reference to these last three photographs. Even so, when the magazine waspublished that Christmas – with retouched, much sharper prints – it caused asensation. The Cottingley fairies became the talk of every London dinner table.But skeptics were outraged at what they regarded as the public’s infantilegullibility. Their basic argument was summed up in the January 5 issue of Truth:“For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not aknowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children”.One detractor, a doctor by the name of Major Hall-Edwards, even went so far asto say:> I criticize the attitude of those who declared there is something supernatural> in the circumstances attending to the taking of these pictures because, as a> medical man, I believe that the inculcation of such absurd ideas into the> minds of children will result in later life in manifestations of nervous> disorder and mental disturbances.> > (One wonders how he felt about parents telling their children that Santa Clauswas a real person.)On the other hand, the Cottingley fairies had their supporters in the media. TheSouth Wales Argus commented: “The day we kill our Santa Claus with ourstatistics we shall have plunged a glorious world into deepest darkness”. TheCity News said more pragmatically: “It seems at this point that we must eitherbelieve in the almost incredible mystery of the fairy or in the almostincredible wonders of faked photographs”.Doyle himself, still in Australia, was delighted by the new pictures. He wroteto Gardner:> My heart gladdened when out here in far Australia I had your note and the> photographs, which are confirmatory of our published results. When our fairies> are admitted other psychic phenomena will find a more ready acceptance . . .> we have had continued messages at séances for some time that a visible sign> was coming through.> > In March 1921, three months after the first article, the Strand publishedDoyle’s second, illustrated with the new photographs. The reaction was much asbefore – one major criticism being that the dresses and hairstyles looked toocontemporary. Other critics objected that the fairies looked too much liketypical “storybook” fairies. Defenders suggested that the physical appearance ofthe fairies might be an ectoplasmic projection based on what the spirits thoughtwas expected of them. And since Elsie and Frances were interested incontemporary fashions, their fairies might well look like a strange hybrid ofthe two elements.As the photographs were reproduced in foreign publications, and the debatespread overseas, it became more heated. But the second set of photographs failedto tip the balance. Few people felt that they made any real difference.One basic problem was that both girls were minors, and as such their testimonywas legally inadmissible; their parents were also unable to offer proof sincethey had never claimed to have seen any “little people”. A photograph taken byan adult who could swear under oath that no trickery had been used might havebeen enough to swing the debate.A friend of Doyle’s the psychic Geoffrey Hodson – who also claimed to have seenfairies – went to Cottingley to see what he could find out. Hodson arrived inCottingley with his wife and Edward Gardner in August 1921. Gardner stayed forjust over a week, during which the weather was generally poor and no fairieswere seen. On the day before he left both Hodson and the girls claimed to havesighted many “nature spirits” (as Hodson called them in his notebook) but failedto get any pictures. Hodson and his wife stayed on, and the fairy sightingsbecame more frequent; but he still failed to capture any of them with a camera.In the end he admitted defeat and left.At this point the debate ran out of steam; there seemed to be too littleevidence to prove the case either way. In 1922 Doyle published a book entitledThe Coming of the Fairies, but although it contained many photographs andreported fairy sightings, it failed to convince the skeptics. For the next fortyyears or so Elsie and Frances were forgotten.In 1965 Elsie, then in her sixties, was tracked down in the Midlands by a DailyExpress reporter, Peter Chambers. He believed that the pictures were faked, andElsie’s comment that people should be left to make up their own minds on thesubject only deepened his skepticism. Elsie made the curious remark: “As for thephotographs, let’s say they are pictures of figments of our imagination,Frances’s and mine, and leave it at that”.This might be taken in one of two ways; either she was making an obliquereference to the ectoplasm theory; or she was admitting that the fairies neverexisted outside her imagination. Now that the subject had been revived, therewere many more interviews with both Frances and Elsie. Much was made of a newadmission that they had seen no fairies during the visit of Geoffrey Hodson;they explained that they were thoroughly bored by the whole subject and felt himto be a fraud, so they amused themselves by pretending to see fairies and weremaliciously amused when he said he could see them too. (In his own book onfairies Hodson insists that he did see “little people” at Cottingley.)In 1971 Elsie was asked by the BBC’s “Nationwide” program if her father had hada hand in the taking of the photographs. She replied, “I would swear on theBible that father didn’t know what was going on”. But when asked if she wouldswear on the Bible that the photographs were not tricks, she replied after apause, “I’d rather leave that open if you don’t mind . . . but my father hadnothing to do with it, I can promise you that”. Again she seemed to be close toadmitting that there was some kind of fraud.On the other hand, when Frances was asked by Yorkshire Television if thephotographs were fabricated, she replied, “Of course not. You tell us how shecould do it – remember she was sixteen and I was ten. Now then, as a child often, can you go through life and keep a secret”?This, it seemed, was the chief argument in favour of the fairy photographs –that it seemed unlikely that Frances and Elsie would and could keep such asecret for so long.Frances made this comment in 1976; the occasion was a television program aboutFrances and Elsie, which had been suggested by the Yorkshire psychicalinvestigator Joe Cooper. That is why, on 10 September 1976, the two women turnedup at a house on Main Street, Cottingley, opposite the house where the Wrightfamily had lived half a century earlier. In the intervening years, Elsie hadlived in India with her husband, Frank Hill, a Scottish engineer; Frances hadmarried a soldier, Frank Way, and had spent much time with him abroad.Cooper describes Frances as “a bespectacled woman of middle class and heightwearing fashionable denim clothes but with a dash of red and black about thescarf and blouse”. Elsie, when she arrived, looked a good ten years younger thanher seventy-five summers, dressed in fashionable slacks and “mod” gear,including a black derby hat. During the day Cooper became friendly with the twowomen, even carrying Elsie over a stile. The camera team interviewed locals –who all expressed extreme skepticism about the photographs – and filmed thewomen down by the stream. Interviewer Austin Mitchell made no secret ofbelieving that the case of the Cottingley fairies had started as a joke, but hadgotten out of hand. Cooper was inclined to believe Frances and Elsie. On camera,Elsie and Frances identified the place where they had seen a gnome and flatlydenied that they had fabricated the photographs. When interviewed by Mitchell,Cooper stated his view that the girls had seen an “elemental form of fairy life”– that is to say, nature spirits. After all, he noted, W. B. Yeats and thousandsof his fellow countrymen were quite certain about the existence of fairies.In 1977 there was an interesting development. A researcher named Fred Gettings,working on nineteenth-century fairy illustrations, came upon Princess Mary’sGift Book, published during the First World War to make money for the Work forWomen fund. It contained a poem entitled “A Spell for a Fairy” by Alfred Noyes,illustrated by Claude Shepperson. Two of the fairies in the illustration werevirtually identical to the fairies in the first Cottingley photograph, whichshowed Frances gazing over the heads of five prancing sprites. Their positionshad merely been reversed.In August 1978 The New Scientist reported that the magician James Randi (“theAmazing Randi”) and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims ofthe Paranormal (CSICOP) had put the photographs through an image-enhancementprocess and found that this revealed strings holding up the fairies. When Coopertold Elsie about the article she merely laughed and pointed out that there wasnowhere in the region of the stream where string could have been tied. After aTV play about the fairies had been broadcast in October 1978, Randi expressedindignation that the BBC had failed to state clearly that the photographs hadbeen proved to be fakes.In 1981 Cooper was writing a book on telepathy and had some correspondence withFrances – who now lived in Ramsgate – about the subject. In September 1981 sheasked him to come see her, telling him that there were “some things he shouldknow”. When he arrived she was still not ready to specify what these were. Butthe following day she asked him to drive her to Canterbury; once there, sheasked him to wait for her while she went into the cathedral. When she returnedthey sat in a coffee shop, and she asked him what he thought of the first fairyphotograph. He commented that it had been greatly touched up. Then Francesdropped her bombshell:“From where I was, I could see the hatpins holding up the figures. I’ve alwaysmarveled that anybody ever took it seriously”.“Why are you telling me”? asked the flabbergasted investigator.“Because Elsie has already told Glenn” [Elsie’s son].“What about the other four? Are they fakes”?Her answer was, in its way, as astonishing as the original admission: “Three ofthem. The last one’s genuine”.Cooper and Frances now discussed writing a book together and giving Elsie ashare of the proceeds; Frances was adamant that Elsie should play no part inwriting the book. Cooper went to London to talk to his publisher. Unfortunately,the publisher was not particularly interested in a sixty-year-old story aboutfairies, especially since it ended so anticlimactically.By this time, the present writer (CW) had also become involved. I had met JoeCooper at a weekend conference on parapsychology (at the Swanwick ConferenceCentre in Derbyshire) in 1980, and he had told me he had written a book on theCottingley fairies – this, of course, was a year before Frances told him thetrue story. He sent me the manuscript, and I found it fascinating. I had alsocome across people – one of them a hardheaded Scottish TV interviewer – whoclaimed to have seen fairies, and I was simply not willing to rule out thepossibility that “nature spirits” might exist. Joe’s own research into theparanormal had convinced him that “elementals” could not merely be ruled out asan absurdity.In fact, I was on my way to Yorkshire to research a poltergeist haunting inPontefract, and that weekend was something of a turning point in my life, forjust before I left the conference centre I met Guy Lyon Playfair, a psychicalresearcher with whom I had been in correspondence for some time. At this time Iaccepted the view of most people involved in psychical research – thatpoltergeists were a strange manifestation of the unconscious mind of apsychologically disturbed teenager. What Playfair suggested left me ratherbewildered. He felt that while some poltergeists may be “spontaneouspsychokinesis”, mind over matter, the majority are genuine spirits who drawtheir energy from human beings, particularly children on the verge of puberty.I have described in my book Poltergeist how my visit to the Pritchard householdin Pontefract soon convinced me that Guy Playfair knew what he was talkingabout. When Diane Pritchard, who had been the focus of the disturbances (i.e.,the person whose energy was “stolen” by the poltergeist), described how she wasdragged up the stairs by some unknown force, I suddenly knew beyond all doubtthat the poltergeist was not some manifestation of her own unconscious mind. Itwas a spirit. This meant that as a writer on the paranormal, I had to get offthe fence and stop keeping an “open mind” about whether such things as spiritscan exist.It seemed clear to me that the spirits involved in most poltergeist cases arethose of the dead – in the Pontefract case, possibly that of a Cluniac monk whohad been hanged for rape in the time of Henry VIII. (The gallows had been on thesite of the Pritchard house.) But that did not necessarily mean that no otherkinds of spirits can exist. The travel writer Laurens Van der Post, for example,had no doubt whatsoever that the nature spirits or gods of the Kalahari bushmenare real and can cause all kinds of problems. In The Lost World of the Kalaharihe describes how “the spirits of the Slippery Hills” became offended when one ofhis team killed a warthog on their territory and caused endless mishaps untilthey received a proper apology. In Poltergeist I cited many similar stories. Soit was hardly logical for me to deny the existence of nature spirits on thegrounds that only a child could believe in them.But the problem with Joe Cooper’s book, even in its original version, was thatthe story was too slight – it could be told in fifty pages, which seemed to meanthat the rest had to be some kind of “padding”. And since, at that point, bothFrances and Elsie were still insisting that the photographs were genuine, thestory had no real conclusion. I tried to find a publisher for the book but wasunsuccessful. And at this point Joe said he wanted to rewrite it anyway; andthere the matter rested.It was in the following year that Frances finally “came clean”. Oddly enough,Joe was excited that the case had finally reached a definite conclusion. When hetold me about Frances’s confession, I was less optimistic. If the book endedwith an admission of fraud, it would be an anticlimax.Joe Cooper came to the same conclusion. Late in 1982 an anthology called TheUnexplained, of which I was a consulting editor, published his article“Cottingley: At Last the Truth”, in which he revealed that the fairies in thefirst four photographs were cutouts stuck to the branches with hatpins.Understandably, this upset both Frances and Elsie. When Frances called Joe’swife on New Year’s Day, 1983, and Joe answered the phone, she called him atraitor and hung up. She died in 1986. Elsie died in 1988, maintaining to theend that she did not believe in fairies.Which seems to be the end of the story . . .Or is it? Certainly the skeptics are justified in regarding the case as closed.Possibly they are correct. Yet before we make up our minds, there are a fewinteresting points to be made.What Frances is asking us to believe is this: She came to England from SouthAfrica in 1917, when she was ten, and went to stay with her sixteen-year-oldcousin, Elsie, in Cottingley. Elsie claimed to have had some odd ghostlyexperiences. For example, she insisted that when she was four she was regularlyvisited in bed by a woman who wore a tight dress buttoned up to her neck. Andwhen she was six she woke up one night and called for a drink; when no onereplied, she went downstairs and found a strange man and woman in the house. Sheasked where her parents were and was told they had gone out to play cards withthe neighbours. Elsie said she wanted to go and find them, and the man openedthe front door and let her out. Her parents – who were, in fact, playing cardswith the neighbours – were startled to see her and even more startled to hearabout the man and woman, for they had left the house empty. But when they wentto investigate, the house was empty.Frances had had no “psychic” experiences. But in the spring of 1918 she saw herfirst gnome. She had gone down to the stream after school and observed aphenomenon she had often observed before: a single willow leaf began to shake onthe tree by the stream. Then a small man, all dressed in green, was standing onthe branch. Frances watched, breathless, terrified of disturbing him. The littleman looked straight at her, then disappeared. After that, she claimed, she oftensaw little men wearing coats of grayish green and matching caps by the stream.She gradually reached the conclusion that the little men were engaged in somekind of purposeful activity, perhaps associated with helping plants to grow.Later, she began to see fairies, with and without wings. These were smaller thanthe elves; they had white faces and arms and often seemed to be holding somekind of meeting. Elsie, she insists, never saw the fairies or little men.It was after falling into the stream yet again that Frances admitted that shewent there to see fairies. And it was the total skepticism of the adults thatled Elsie to decide to take some fairy photographs. This was not simply a desireto deceive. Elsie believed Frances when she said she saw fairies; her ownpsychic experiences made it seem quite plausible. She wanted to shake thecredulity of the grown-ups. So the photographs were taken with cutouts proppedup by hatpins.When the world suddenly became interested in the fairies, the girls were in adifficult position. The photographs were fakes. Yet – according to the girls –the fairies really existed. If the whole thing had been a hoax, it would havebeen easier to confess. But it was not a hoax – not totally, anyway. They werein an embarrassing and anomalous position. If they admitted that the photographswere fakes, they would be implying that the whole affair was a deception. Andthat would be as untrue as continuing to maintain that the photographs weregenuine. So they decided to keep silent.When the whole affair blew up again in 1965, the situation was unchanged. It istrue that Elsie, now a hardheaded woman in her sixties, was no longer convincedthat Frances had seen fairies; yet she was absolutely certain that she had had“psychic” experiences and was therefore prepared to be open-minded. As toFrances, she had seen fairies and had nothing to retract. In a letter to LeslieGardner, the son of Edward Gardner, Elsie remarked that after her interview withPeter Chambers (in 1965), in which she had declared that people must judge forthemselves and that the pictures were “figments of our imaginations”, Franceshad said indignantly, “What did you say that for? You know very well that theywere real”.In fact, Frances had always maintained that the fairies were real. In November1918 she sent the first fairy photograph to a friend in South Africa andscrawled on the back: “Elsie and I are very friendly with the beck Fairies. It’sfunny I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there”.In his original manuscript of the Cottingley book, Joe Cooper had included achapter entitled “Other Sightings”, consisting of accounts of fairies related tohim by various witnesses, and it makes clear why he believed Frances. One man, ahealer, told how he was sitting with a girl in Gibraltar, eating a sandwich,when it was snatched from him by “a little man about eighteen inches high”. Aneighty-year-old official of the Theosophical Society insisted that when he was asmall boy he was often visited in bed by a green-clad gnome. Another old mandescribed seeing a green-clad gnome, about two feet high, walking along a pathin a cornfield. Some young male students told how, when walking in a wood nearBradford, they saw fairies who were “circling and dancing” but who wereinvisible to the direct gaze; they could only be seen “out of the corner of theeye”. An elderly woman showed Cooper a photograph of a gnome seen through afrosty window; she claimed that she had come down one morning, seen the gnome,and rushed upstairs to get her camera. The photograph also shows diminutivewhite rabbits.Joe Cooper finally published most of these accounts in his book Modern PsychicExperiences, together with many more. A New Zealand medium named Dorothydescribed how she used to play with a “spirit” girl named Mabel as a child andhow she had first seen fairies, who came from under plants. One day she camehome to find her father unconscious on the floor – a gastric ulcer hadperforated – and the fairies took charge and escorted her to the doctor’s house.Joe Cooper’s own niece, Jo, who was in her thirties, described how, at the ageof sixteen, she had seen three little men crouching on top of a wall.When I wrote about the Cottingley fairies in Poltergeist (before Frances had“confessed”), I also went to some trouble to find accounts of “real” fairies. Idescribed being interviewed on television at the 1978 Edinburgh Festival by aman named Bobbie (whose surname I forgot to note in my journal); in the pub nextdoor he told me casually that he had once seen a gnome standing on the pavementoutside a convent gate and that it had “scared the hell out of him”.My friend Marc Alexander, author of many books on the paranormal, told me astory of a friend in New Zealand named Pat Andrew, who claimed to have seen apixie when he was six. Years later, after seeing a stage hypnotist, Marc andAndrew began experimenting with hypnosis on each other. Marc had no doubt thatAndrew was genuinely hypnotized, and one day he decided to try and “regress” himto the age at which he saw the pixie. The result was an amazing one-sidedconversation that left Marc in no doubt whatever that, whether Andrew had reallyseen a pixie or not, he undoubtedly believed he had.One of the most convincing accounts I know of is an encounter with a pixie asrecounted by another friend, Lois Bourne, in her book Witch Among Us. Lois is a“witch” in the sense that she possesses odd psychic powers, of whose reality Ihave not the slightest doubt. She is an extremely sensible and down-to-earthwoman. And in her book, among many stories that psychical researchers will findcredible enough, she tells a story that will obviously cause most readers todoubt her truthfulness or her sanity. While on holiday at a cottage at Crantock,in Cornwall, she met a member of a “wicca” coven and spent an evening at herhome. The woman’s husband, Rob, asked her if she would like to see a goblin,explaining that one appeared among the rushes of the millstream at Treago Mill,Cuberts Heath, every morning at sunrise; if she wanted to see him, she had to beup early. The next morning Lois and her husband, Wilfred, joined Rob at the millgate, and they crept up to the stream. Bourne writes:> I have never been able to decide, and still cannot decide, whether I really> saw that goblin, or if Rob made me see it . . . Whatever it was, there,> sitting on a stone calmly washing his socks, was an elfin creature with a red> hat, green coat and trews, one yellow sock on, and one in his tiny hands in> the process of being washed. I remember thinking at the time, in my sleepy,> befuddled, but practical way, “What an atrocious colour combination”. Suddenly> he saw us and he disappeared . . . “Now do you believe me”? asked Rob.> > I have known Lois for years. I may be gullible and she may be a liar, but Ibelieve her. She is not the type to invent such a silly story. And her husband,Wilfred – who also saw it – is not the type to support a downright lie.As already mentioned, the poet W.B. Yeats had been convinced of the existence offairies ever since he and Lady Gregory went door to door collecting informationfrom the local peasants. They recorded these interviews in a 1920 book entitledVisions and Beliefs. Evans Wentz concludes his Fairy Faith in Celtic Countriesby acknowledging: “We seem to have arrived at a point . . . where we canpostulate scientifically . . . the existence of such invisible intelligences asgods, genii, daemons, all kinds of true fairies, and disembodied men”. (By thelatter he means ghosts.) And he goes on to cite the very sound evidence for theexistence of the poltergeist. George Russell (AE) and Evans Wentz emphasize thatthese entities are seen only by “psychics”, and Russell believes that suchbeings are not “individuals” in the human sense: “Theirs is a collective life,so unindividualised and so calm that I might have more varied thoughts in fivehours than they would have in five years”.When all of this is taken into account, we may feel that the notion that Francesreally saw fairies by the stream in Cottingley no longer seems quite so absurd."},{"pageContent":"17 Fulcanelli and the Mysteries of AlchemyIn the autumn of 1926 there appeared in Paris a limited edition of a book calledThe Mystery of the Cathedrals – La Mystère des Cathédrales – whose author wasnamed on the title page simply as “Fulcanelli”. It was a book written by a manwho claimed to be an alchemist, and was addressed to his fellow-alchemists. Itsthesis is that the great Gothic cathedrals are not simply temples of theChristian religion but are also “stone books” whose pages contain the encodedsecrets of alchemy. According to Fulcanelli, the word “Gothic” is not derivedfrom the Germanic people known as the Goths but from the word argot, meaningslang. Arts gothiques – Gothic art – should be spelt argotiques: for argot is alanguage used by those who do not wish their meaning to be understood byoutsiders. The rest of the book is an elegant exposition of some of the “stonesecrets” of the cathedrals of Notre Dame, Amiens and Bourges.The preface to the first edition was written by one “Eugene Canseliet”, whodeclares that the author of the book, his “Master”, has now disappeared. “Havingachieved the pinnacle of knowledge, could he refuse to obey the commands ofDestiny”? “Fulcanelli is no more”, says Canseliet, and then goes on to thank theartist, Julien Champagne, “to whom my master has entrusted the illustration ofhis work”.Although printed only in an edition of three hundred copies – or possiblybecause of this – the reputation of Mystery of the Cathedrals continued to grow,so that another edition was called for in 1957. In his new preface Canselietadmits that “Fulcanelli” is a pseudonym under which his master has chosen toconceal his identity, and he quotes a long letter from Fulcanelli to his master,congratulating him on finally achieving the “Gift of God” or the “Great Work”,the Philosopher’s Stone of the alchemists.When the book was translated into English in 1971 it contained an additionalintroduction by the translator’s husband, Walter Lang – the pseudonym of EdwardCampbell – in which he reveals that he has met Canseliet, and learned thatCanseliet had seen Fulcanelli after his “disappearance” in 1922. That meetingoccurred thirty years later, yet according to Canseliet, his master appeared tobe thirty years younger than when he had last seen him. Fulcanelli had beeneighty in 1924; now he looked a mere fifty. What was stranger still was thatFulcanelli was now dressed as a woman. Canseliet’s story was that he hadreceived a summons from Fulcanelli, and journeyed to a château in the mountains.There he was greeted by Fulcanelli in his normal male guise, and assigned analchemical labouratory to work in. A few days later he strolled downstairs earlyin the morning and stood in his braces. Across the courtyard he saw a group ofthree women dressed in the style of the sixteenth century. As they passed himone of them turned, and he recognized Fulcanelli. But later Canselietrecollected that one of the basic symbols of alchemy is the androgyne orhermaphrodite, and that this is sometimes used as a symbol of the “completedwork” – the achievement of the philosopher’s stone. Was Fulcanelli telling himthat he had now achieved the aim of a lifetime?By the time Mystery of the Cathedrals appeared in English, Fulcanelli hadachieved a legendary status, rather like that of the Comte de Saint-Germain (seechapter 47). This was largely due to the role he plays in a best-selling work byLouis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, The Morning of the Magicians (1960), whichwas largely responsible for the “occult revival” of the 1960s. According toPauwels, his friend Bergier was studying chemistry in 1933 when he confided tohis professor his desire to study alchemy – and was instantly and predictablyrebuffed. The student protested that one form of alchemy – nuclear energy –should be possible, but the professor assured him that this was also animpossibility. All the same, Bergier continued to study alchemy. From 1934 to1940 he worked with André Helbronner, the distinguished physicist who died inBuchenwald. And among Helbronner’s acquaintance there were manypseudo-alchemists, and at least one genuine alchemist, whose name Bergier neverlearned. “The man of whom we are speaking disappeared some time ago withoutleaving any visible traces, to lead a clandestine existence, having severed allconnection between himself and the century in which he lived”. Bergier can onlyguess that he may have been the man who, under the pseudonym of Fulcanelli,wrote “two strange and admirable books, Les Demeures Philosophales and LaMystère des Cathédrales . . .”Pauwels goes on to tell how, one afternoon in June 1937, Bergier thought he wasin the presence of Fulcanelli. At Helbronner’s request Bergier met the“alchemist” at the labouratory of the Gas Board in Paris. What the man had totell him was that Helbronner’s researches into nuclear energy were very close tosuccess, and that “the research in which you and your colleagues are engaged isfraught with terrible dangers . . . for the whole human race”. Radioactivity,said the alchemist, could poison the atmosphere of the planet, and a few gramsof metal could produce enough energy to destroy a whole city. “Alchemists haveknown it for a very long time”. Picking up Soddy’s book The Interpretation ofRadium, he read aloud a paragraph suggesting that earlier civilizations(Atlantis?) had been destroyed by atomic radiation.But the most interesting part of the account lies in the alchemist’s reply toBergier’s question about the nature of his researches.> I can tell you this much: you are aware that in the official science of today> the role of the observer becomes more and more important . . . The secret of> alchemy is this: there is a way of manipulating matter and energy so as to> produce what modern scientists call a “field of force”. This field acts on the> observer and puts him in a privileged position vis-à-vis the Universe. From> this position he has access to the realities which are ordinarily hidden from> us by time and space, matter and energy. This is what we call “The Great> Work”.> > “But what about the philosopher’s stone? The fabrication of gold”?> > “These are only applications, particular cases. The essential thing is not the> transmutation of metals, but that of the experimenter himself. It’s an ancient> secret that a few men rediscover once in a century”.> > Jacques Sadoul, another modern student of alchemy, makes the same point in hisbook Alchemists and Gold.> Actually the transmutatory powder was simply an experiment carried out at the> end of the Master Work, to make certain that the substance manufactured was> indeed the Philosopher’s Stone . . . Their aim, after having transmuted a> metal, was to transmute themselves by swallowing a homoeopathic dose of the> Stone twice a year.> > When he swallows this dose, the alchemist loses all his hair, nails and teeth;but they grow again, stronger and healthier than before. The adept becomesyounger, and no longer needs food although he may still eat for enjoyment.Most modern readers will be understandably sceptical about all this, and theonly full-length book on Canseliet’s mysterious Master, The FulcanelliPhenomenon by Kenneth Raynor Johnson (1980), will do little to undermine hisscepticism. He tells how in the 1930s a student of the occult named RobertAmbelain became so intrigued by Fulcanelli’s books (the second, The DwellingPlaces of Philosophy, is an expansion of the ideas of the first) that he set outto try to track him down. He called on the publisher, Jean Schemit, to askpermission to quote Fulcanelli’s books in a work of his own, In the Shadow ofthe Cathedrals. Schemit told him how, in the early part of 1926, he was visitedby a shortish man with a long Gallic moustache. The stranger began talking toSchemit about Gothic architecture, and claimed that it was a kind of code(“argot”), known as the “green language”. He went on to argue that slangcontained many plays on words and puns that actually indicated a profoundphilosophical depth: in fact, it was the ancient hermetic language, the“Language of the Birds” – that is to say, of the initiates. He then left. A fewweeks later Canseliet appeared in Schemit’s office, and left with him themanuscript of The Mystery of the Cathedrals. Schemit read it, and recognized thespeech patterns of his previous visitor. He decided to publish it. Soon after,Canseliet called again, bringing with him the artist who would illustrate thebook, Jean-Julien Champagne. And in Champagne Schemit recognized his previousvisitor. Canseliet showed him “extraordinary respect and admiration, addressinghim one minute as “Master”, the next as “my Master”. Canseliet also referred toChampagne as “my Master” in his absence. Schemit consequently reached theconclusion that Fulcanelli was Champagne.Canseliet always insisted that his friend Champagne was simply an illustrator,but this was flatly contradicted by an article in a popular occult magazinecontaining a description of an illustration by Champagne; the illustration wasfull of alchemical symbols, and the author of the article admitted that thedescription was by Champagne himself. The same author, a man called JulesBoucher, told Ambelain that Champagne possessed a biscuit tin containing gumresin, and that Champagne would often inhale its odours deeply, telling Boucherthat it possessed some magical quality that enabled him to gain “intuitiveinsights into the knowledge he sought”. Boucher also said that Champagne couldinduce “OBE’s” – “out-of-the-body experiences” – at will.Champagne had died in 1932, in his mid-sixties. His former landlady toldAmbelain that Canseliet and Champagne had occupied rooms at 59 bis rue deRochechouart – the attic – and that Canseliet treated Champagne with greatrespect, addressing him as Master. So it would seem to be a logical conclusionthat Champagne was Canseliet’s “master” – i.e., Fulcanelli.Boucher – who was also a “pupil” of Champagne – had no doubt that Champagne andFulcanelli were the same person. When Champagne was correcting the proofs of TheMystery of the Cathedrals he became extremely indignant at printing errors, andthe proofs of the two books “were redrafted eight times under the watchful eyesof their author”. Moreover, said Jules Boucher, Champagne wrote theintroductions to the books, which he asked Canseliet to sign.Canseliet, predictably, denies all this. He claims that Schemit never metChampagne, and insists that he himself wrote the introductions. He tends to bedismissive of Boucher’s claims to have known Champagne intimately. But then ifChampagne and Canseliet invented Fulcanelli between them, this would beperfectly understandable. Having gone to the trouble of creating a modern myth –not unlike that of Saint-Germain – why should he admit that the whole thing is astraightforward piece of mystification?Kenneth Raynor Johnson’s arguments against the Champagne-Fulcanelliidentification are also unconvincing. He points out that Champagne was awell-known practical joker, as well as an alcoholic. As an example ofChampagne’s sense of humour, he tells how Champagne advised a gullible studentthat the first step in alchemy was to fill his room with bags of coal. When thestudent had heaved sack after sack up several flights of stairs, and hadscarcely enough room left to lie down on his bed, Champagne told him that thesearch for the philosopher’s stone was a waste of time, and that he had betterforget it. This suggests that Champagne’s sense of humour was both puerile andcruel. This, Johnson argues, hardly sounds like the author of The Mystery of theCathedrals, to which the obvious answer is: why not? Immersion in magic and“occultism” seems to demand a peculiar temperament; it can be seen in a dozencases, from Paracelsus and Cornelius Agrippa to Macgregor Mathers and AleisterCrowley, all of whom combined the temperament of a genuine “seeker after truth”with that of a confidence trickster. Contemporary accounts reveal that the“great adept” Saint-Germain was vain, talkative and boastful, and among “adepts”this seems to be the rule rather than the exception.Does this mean then that alchemy should be regarded as a fantasy or a waste oftime? The commonsense answer should obviously be yes. But common sense caneasily lead us into error, as when it tells us that the sun revolves round theearth or that matter is solid. Jung’s studies of alchemy led him to conclude –like Bergier’s mysterious alchemist – that the real purpose of alchemy is totransform the alchemist: in other words, that it is, like yoga or mysticism, aspiritual discipline. The main difference between Jung and Freud was that forFreud the world is divided into sick people and “normal” people, while Jung hadalways been fascinated by “supernormal” people – saints and men of genius. Jungwanted to find a connection between “depth psychology” and supernormal people,and thought that he might have found it in alchemy, which like certain earlierresearchers he was inclined to see as a “mystery religion”. But after studyingobscure alchemical texts for many years, and attempting to “interpret” them asif they were full of dream symbolism, he reached the somewhat disappointingconclusion that the alchemist “projected” his own basic obsessions into hisexperiments, much as we might “see” faces in the clouds, so that alchemy becamea kind of mirror in which he saw his own hidden depths. In other words, it was akind of unconscious self-deception.Yet in his later work on synchronicity (see Chapter 54) Jung had stumbled onsome vital clues to this problem. By synchronicity Jung meant “meaningfulcoincidence as, for example, when we hear a name for the first time, then hearit half a dozen times more over the next twenty-four hours, almost as if “fate”is trying to make sure we learn it by heart. Jung tried hard to find“scientific” explanations for such coincidences, talking about an “acausalconnecting principle” and about Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Critics likeArthur Koestler have suggested that Jung was merely trying to dress up “occult”ideas in acceptable scientific terminology.But it is generally agreed that the basis of “occultism” is the statementattributed to Hermes Trismegistos (after whom the “hermetic art” is named) “Asabove, so below”, which means the pattern of the greater universe is repeated inthe smaller universe of the human soul (microcosm). In Alchemists and GoldJacques Sadoul begins by quoting a translation of the so-called Emerald Tabletof Hermes by Fulcanelli: “As below, so above; and as above, so below. With thisknowledge alone you may work miracles”.What we might call the Jungian interpretation of this is as follows. It isself-evident that external events influence our states of mind (or soul). Butperhaps the most fundamental tenet of occultism is that the human soul caninfluence external events, possibly by some process of induction not unlike thatemployed in an induction coil. The principle of the latter is as follows. Whenan electric current is passed through a coil of wire it creates a “field” aroundthe wire. And if another coil of wire, with more “circles” of wire, is woundaround the first, a far more powerful current is somehow induced in the secondcoil. A piece of American electrical equipment runs off a current of 120 volts;in England the voltage is twice as high; so if I wish to use an Americanelectric razor in England, or vice versa, I merely have to buy a smalltransformer which will either “step up” 120 to 240 volts, or “step down” 240volts to 120. The electrical vibrations in one coil communicate themselves tothe other, and induce a stronger – or weaker – current.The law “As above, so below” may be thus interpreted: the human soul can, underthe right circumstances, induce its own “vibrations” in the material world; oneresult of this process is coincidence – or rather, synchronicity.It is also true, of course, that the “mind-transformer” can be used for theopposite purpose: to “step down” the vital current to a lower level. This is infact the problem with most human beings: we use our mind-transformer the wrongway round. More often than not, a vague general sense of “discouragement” orpessimism causes “negative induction” in the environment. We are all familiarwith the feeling that this is just “one of those days”, and how on such dayseverything seems to go wrong. Moreover, we all recognize instinctively that thisis due to our own negative attitudes; they seem to attract bad luck.The reverse is the feeling that things are somehow destined to go right, andthat in some odd way the optimism induced by this intuition will induce“serendipity”. In such moments we also have a glimpse of an exciting insight:that if we could learn to create this mood of optimism at will we could somehowmake things go right. Everyone recognizes the other side of the same coin: thatpessimistic people who “expect the worst” somehow attract bad luck. Yet thefeeling that the right mental attitudes can induce good luck is oddly worrying;it seems to be tempting fate . . .All this, I would argue, is implied in the Jungian theory of synchronicity, andin the “hermetic law”, As above, so below. And if this law is also thestarting-point of alchemy, then it is obviously a mistake to think of alchemy asa misguided form of chemistry whose aim is the transmutation of lead into gold.Sadoul is obviously right; the transmutation is merely a symbol of somethingelse. But if the transmutation is merely another name for mystical insight, asynonym for satori or enlightenment, then why waste time with retorts andcrucibles?What seems to be implied is that alchemy is a method, like yoga or thedisciplines of Zen. Ancient alchemists may well have believed that lead can betransmuted into gold by some straightforward chemical process, but their moderncounterparts know better. They recognize that, in a basic sense, alchemy is asymbol for the actual process of living. The traditional alchemist begins withthe so-called prima materia (which some believe to be salt, some mercury, othersearth, even water), which must be mixed with “secret fire” and heated in asealed vessel; this should first of all become black (the “nigredo”) then white(the “albedo”). This is mixed with “mercury” (but not necessarily the mercury ofthe chemist), and then dissolved in acid; after a process known as “the greenlion” it finally turns red – the philosopher’s stone. For all human beings, theprima materia is the world of their everyday experience. Pleasant surprises,enjoyable physical stimuli, flashes of “holiday consciousness” can transmuteeveryday experience into what J.B. Priestley calls “delight”, and that strangefeeling that “all is well”. When we experience such moments we always findourselves confronting the same insight: that, as absurd as it sounds, thepleasant experience that triggered the insight was unnecessary; we should beable to achieve it by an act of will.The whole chemical process of alchemy may be seen as a parallel to thisexperience. Canseliet remarks that Fulcanelli would never have attempted “thegreat work” unless he started with a conviction that it was possible. And thisseems to be the initial step in the process we are discussing: the creation of astate of optimism, a pragmatic state of “intentionality”. The implication of theclassic texts of alchemy is that the alchemist must somehow “support” thechemical process by a psychological process. It is only when he has achieved theright state of mind, of “positive induction”, that the transformation can beachieved. And the ultimate aim of the process is not the philosopher’s stone butthe state of mind in which the philosopher’s stone can be manufactured. The aimof the alchemical process is to make the “operator” recognize that he cancontrol his own mental states. The use of sexual symbolism in alchemy may be ahint that the nearest most human beings come to this control is in the mentalcomponent of sexual experience.In a sense, therefore, it is irrelevant whether Fulcanelli really existed orwhether he was Jean-Julien Champagne, or even whether Canseliet invented him.The “adepts” themselves recognize this basic principle when they insist uponanonymity. All the classic texts seem to agree that physical transmutation is agenuine possibility; yet even this may be regarded as an irrelevant by-product.Sadoul states that this is why no successful alchemist has ever bothered to makelarge quantities of gold.In a Books and Bookmen review of Timothy Leary’s Flashbacks (November 1983) JohnWalsh remarked: “Expanded consciousness, Leary maintains, leads to a radicallydifferent, wider and more libertarian system of ‘imprinting’ by which the humanbrain gives itself, in a single blinding moment, an image of the whole worldwithin which it moves, and thereafter draws strength and mental sustenance fromsuch a paradigm”. This could also be taken as a convenient summary of thefundamental purpose of “alchemy”."},{"pageContent":"18 The Glozel MysteryArchaeological Riddle or Fraud?One day in 1869 a band of hunters from the castle of Santillana del Mar, at thefoot of the Cantabrian Hills of northern Spain, realized that they had lost adog. They whistled and searched and eventually heard the animal yelping from acrack in the ground. Cold air blew up from the crack. They made their way downthe crack, and their torches revealed a large cave. They rescued the dog andreturned to tell their master, Don Marcelino de Sautuola, of their discovery.The Don made his way down the crack, determined that the cave was just a hole inthe ground of no particular interest, and decided to seal it up to preventvillage boys from playing in it. For the next nine years he forgot about it.But in 1878 he visited the Paris Exhibition and was fascinated by glass cabinetsfull of Ice Age tools and engravings. (The last Ice Age ended about 12,000 yearsago.) On his return home, Don Marcelino consulted an expert on the correctprocedure for searching for Ice Age artifacts, then set out for the cave armedwith a spade and a torch.His early excavations were disappointing; he found nothing. Finally, nearly ayear later, he was rewarded by the discovery of a hand axe and some stonearrowheads. He began to dig with renewed vigor. And one day, when hisfive-year-old daughter, Maria, was in the cave with him, he heard her call outwith astonishment. She was in a recess that the Don had ignored because it wastoo low for him. But the child had seen pictures of charging bulls on the walls.At first the Don was unable to see anything; then, as he moved his candle closerto the wall, he recognized the eye of a bison. A closer examination revealedthat the wall was covered with pictures of bison – bulls, cows, and calves – inall sorts of postures. The one he had first seen was lying on its side, in theprocess of dying. The ceiling and the other walls were covered with even moreextraordinary paintings. When he touched them he realized that the pigment wasstill wet.Together with his friend Professor Vilanova, Marcelino announced his discoveryto the world; visitors – including the king of Spain – flocked to the cave(today known as Altamira). But when he went to a congress of prehistorians inLisbon, Marcelino was stunned to discover that they regarded his cave paintingsas a fraud. Indeed, all the learned men of Europe denounced them. Marcelino hadthem reproduced in a book; it was ignored. Ancient cavemen could not possiblypaint like that, said the experts; it had to be a confidence trick. His chiefenemy, a prehistorian named Cartailhac, even refused him admission to a congressin Algiers.Years later Cartailhac went to look at newly discovered caves at Les Eyzies, inthe Vézère Valley, and found them full of paintings like those at Altamira. Toolate, he returned to Altamira to apologize for his mistake; the child Maria, nowa grown woman, could only take him to see her father’s grave.This story, not untypical of the behavior of “experts”, may serve as a preludeto another tale of discovery that began in 1924, when a cow stumbled into a holein southern France. This happened on a farm owned by the Fradin family, nearGlozel, not far from Vichy. The family had turned up a few pottery fragmentsduring the First World War; now, investigating the hole into which the cow hadstumbled, they found “a kind of tomb”, containing various pots and inscribedtablets. There was an oval paving of bricks, some of which had melted glass onthem, and other lumps of glass lay around. A local schoolmistress told theFradins that they had found a cremation grave and that this explained the meltedglass. But another visitor to the site thought it more likely that they hadstumbled upon a Roman or medieval glass kiln.In the following year a Vichy doctor named Morlet, who was also an amateurarchaeologist, came to the farm. He had recently found a skeleton in his owngarden. When the Fradins told him that they had been trying to persuade thelocal historical society to defray the cost of their digging, Morlet made themistake of offering to buy their finds – and any more they might stumble upon –and told them to fence off the site. It was a mistake because it later led tothe accusation that the Fradins had devised a hoax for the sake of money. Yet itseems clear that they had made no attempt to profit from their discovery beforeMorlet came on the scene.The Fradins and Morlet now began to excavate the site – which became known as“the Field of the Dead” – together. They soon uncovered an astonishing varietyof objects. These included bone carvings of animals and pictures of reindeer onstones, as well as marks that seemed to be writing. In fact, they unearthed manyinscribed tablets. They also found carved faces – each about an inch high – anda figure of a human being standing on an animal. One French writer, RobertCharroux, whose books on ancient mysteries have been credited with inspiringErich von Däniken (see chapter 8), declared confidently in 1969: “Little isknown about the Glozel civilization, except that it must have existed before theFlood, the great cataclysm which blocked the caves at Lascaux and swallowed upthe necropolis or religious centre at Glozel, all the inhabitants having died inthe disaster”. He estimated that Glozel flourished about 15,000 years ago,toward the end of the last great ice age.This was the period of the Magdalenian culture, to which the paintings ofAltamira and Lascaux (discovered in 1940) belong. Because the hunters andfishers of this period were surrounded by an abundance of food, a populationexplosion occurred, and large numbers of people began to live in lakesidedwellings. If, as Charroux believes, Glozel belongs to this period, then thetablets with writing on them certainly support his thesis that civilization isfar older than we believe – which in turn provides an argument for the “ancientastronaut” theory discussed in chapter 8.The Glozel pottery makes this thesis unlikely, however, for the earliest knownpottery dates from many thousands of years later – 9,000 years ago in Japan andmuch later in Europe. Some of the Glozel pottery has owl-like faces on it, likeFrench Bronze Age pottery (from around 2000 BC). On the other hand, Morlet datedcertain polished axe heads to the Neolithic (New Stone Age) period, after 9000BC. If he was correct, then writing was not invented in the Middle East (Sumer)around 3500 BC but in France five thousand years earlier.One noted French authority on the subject was Professor Salomon Reinach, theauthor of a best-selling book on the history of religion entitled Orpheus. Hisfirst reaction to the Glozel finds was that they might be forgeries. But when hewent to Glozel he became convinced that they were in fact genuine. The skepticswere later to point out that Glozel seemed to support some of Reinach’s pettheories, such as that reindeer lived on in France much later thanarchaeologists believed, and that France was the cradle of civilization. In anyevent, he announced his conviction that the finds were genuine, and the resultwas a great deal of publicity, which made Glozel a tourist attraction.Other archaeologists reacted by declaring their conviction that Glozel was afraud and that the Fradins were busily manufacturing “ancient” artifacts andburying them. When roughly built tombs were discovered, the anti-Glozelianspointed out that no earth had found its way between the cracks in thousands ofyears and that this seemed unlikely. The curator of the museum atVilleneuve-sur-Lot announced that he had taken shelter in a barn in Glozel inSeptember 1927 and had seen some half-finished artifacts and some unbaked claytablets. If true, this evidence was damning. On the other hand, as theGlozelians pointed out, the curator of a rival museum might have his own reasonsfor raising doubts about Glozel.A commission sent to Glozel by the International Anthropological Congress of1927 came up with an unfavourable report, declaring that the finds were “of nogreat age”. Police now descended on Glozel and seized various artifacts, whichwere sent off to the police labouratory in Paris. Reinach countered by getting aSwedish policeman named Soderman to have the bone objects tested in a Stockholmlabouratory. The lab reported that the bone had a lower organic content thanmodern bone. The Paris police report, on the other hand, declared that theartifacts seemed to be modern and that one Neolithic axe head looked as if ithad been worked with a file. But the Glozelians declined to be convinced. Whenaccused of fraud, Emile Fradin sued and won his case – although he was awardedonly one franc.The controversy dragged on, but – as in the case of Altamira – skepticismprevailed, and it became generally accepted that the Glozel finds werefraudulent. And when, in 1953, the famous “Piltdown skull” was shown to be ahoax (see chapter 35), it became the fashion to classify Glozel and Piltdowntogether. Glozel had also been hailed as a kind of missing link – in this case,the missing link between Old Stone Age hunters and Neolithic farmers – a gaparchaeologists referred to as “the ancient hiatus”. Old Stone Age hunters weresupposed to have followed the retreating reindeer north and the New Stone Agefarmers to have come in from elsewhere, possibly Asia. Reinach was convinced –rightly, as it turned out – that this never happened and that the New Stone Agefarmers were the descendants of the Old Stone Age hunters. So Glozel filled thehiatus. Eventually, the hiatus dissolved, like the missing link. And Glozelbecame not merely suspect but irrelevant.Then, in 1974, Emile Fradin – who had been seventeen at the time of the firstfinds – announced that scientific examination of Glozel artifacts in Denmark hadproved their authenticity. The technique used was called thermoluminescence.When pottery is fired, it gives off trapped electrons that originate inradioactive traces in the clay. Then the pot gradually reaccumulates trappedelectrons from radioactivity. If the pot is heated to between 300 and 500°C, itgives off a glow, which results from the release of trapped electrons. Thegreater the glow, the older the pot. Samples of Glozel pottery had been given toDr. Hugh McKerrel of the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, and Dr VagnMejdahl of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission. They measured thethermoluminescence of the Glozel pottery and concluded that it had been firedabout the time of Christ, some of it possibly eight hundred years earlier.This, of course, contradicted Reinach’s thesis that the pottery was Neolithic.But it also contradicted the notion that the pottery finds at Glozel had beenfired in a kiln on the farm. Some of the tablets with writing were also dated tothe same period.Archaeologists were outraged and accused the physicists of bungling. The BBC“Chronicle” program promptly invited a team of experts to go and have anotherlook at Glozel. Their conclusion was that the new evidence was still at variancewith the facts. If the Glozel pottery dated from between 2,000 and 2,800 yearsago, then the later examples should have been like other pottery of the periodwhen France (Gaul) was occupied by the Romans. It wasn’t. It was sui generis –of its own unique type.And so the mystery remains. Is Glozel another Piltdown hoax? That is a temptingconclusion, but if we accept it, we have to ignore some facts to the contrary.Charles Dawson, the man who found the Piltdown skull, was an amateurarchaeologist, so he may have had a motive for the forgery (although it is stillnot clear what this was). But when Emile Fradin and his grandfather found thefirst “tomb” (or glass kiln), they had no reason for deception. And if it istrue that earlier finds had turned up during the First World War, then thispoint is underlined. They made no attempt to cash in on the find, and it was notuntil a year later that Dr. Morlet arrived on the scene and the Fradins finallybegan to make a profit from their finds.Did this tempt them to begin faking artifacts? That is certainly possible. Butwould an uneducated French farmer have the kind of knowledge to fake pottery,axe heads, bone figurines, and engraved clay tablets? Besides, one of theearliest finds was a brick with “writing” on it. If this was genuine, then thelater finds may have been genuine too. And the conclusion would have to be that,at the time of Socrates, Glozel housed a small and flourishing community withits own special culture.Reinach was undoubtedly wrong. Glozel does not prove that writing originated inFrance in the New Stone Age. But the (admittedly confusing) evidence seems toindicate that the experts may also be wrong and that – like Don Marcelino – theFradins may one day be due for a belated apology."},{"pageContent":"19 The Grey Man of Ben MacDhuiAt the 27th Annual General Meeting of the Cairngorm Club in Aberdeen, inDecember 1925, the eminent mountaineer Professor Norman Collie made a startlingdisclosure. He told how in 1890 he was climbing alone on Ben MacDhui, 4,000 feetabove sea-level, when he had a terrifying experience. As he was returning fromthe cairn on the plateau there was a heavy mist, and Collie heard crunchingnoises behind him, “as if someone was walking after me, but taking steps threeor four times the length of my own”. He told himself it was nonsense, but as hewalked on, and the footsteps continued to sound behind him, “I was seized withterror and took to my heels, staggering blindly among the boulders for four orfive miles down to Rothiemurchus Forest”.In fact Collie had told the story twenty-three years earlier, to friends in NewZealand, and the result was a report in a New Zealand newspaper headlined: “AProfessor’s Panic”. As a result of this story, another Scottish mountaineer, DrA.M. Kellas – who was to die during the Mount Everest Reconnaissance expeditionof 1921–2 – wrote to Collie telling him of his own curious experience on BenMacDhui. Kellas and his brother Henry had been chipping the rock for crystalslate one afternoon when they saw a giant figure coming down towards them fromthe cairn. It passed out of sight briefly in a dip, and as the two men fled downthe mountainside again in mist both of them were convinced that they were beingfollowed by the “giant”.This account makes it sound as if some form of “Yeti”, or Abominable Snowman,lives on the slopes of Ben MacDhui. But accounts by other climbers make it clearthat the explanation may not be as simple as this. Peter Densham, who was incharge of aeroplane rescue work in the Cairngorms during the Second World War,described in an interview with a journalist how in May 1945 he had left thevillage of Aviemore and climbed to the cairn on the summit. Suddenly, as he waslooking across at Ben Nevis, the mist closed in. He sat there eating chocolate,conscious of strange noises which he attributed to the expansion and contractionof the rocks, when he had a strong feeling that there was someone near him. Thenhe felt something cold on the back of his neck, and a sense of pressure. Hestood up, and heard crunching noises from the direction of the cairn. He wenttowards the cairn to investigate, “not in the least frightened”. Then suddenlyhe experienced a feeling of apprehension, and found himself running towardsLurcher’s Crag, with its sheer drop. “I tried to stop myself and found this wasextremely difficult to do. It was as if someone was pushing me. I managed todeflect my course, but with a great deal of difficulty . . .” He ran most of theway back down the mountain.On another occasion Densham was on the mountain with his friend Richard Frere,searching for an aeroplane that was reported to have crashed. They were sittingclose to the cairn when Densham was surprised to hear Frere apparently talkingto himself on the other side of the cairn. Then he realized that Frere wastalking to someone else. “I went round and found myself joining in theconversation. It was a strange experience which seemed to have a psychic aspect.We talked to someone invisible for some time, and it seemed we had carried onthis conversation for some little time when we suddenly realized that there wasno one there but ourselves. Afterwards, neither of us, strangely, could recallthe purport of this extraordinary conversation”. What seems even stranger isthat when Frere himself was tracked down by Affleck Gray, the author of a bookcalled The Big Grey Man of Ben MacDhui, he had no recollection of the episodedescribed by Densham. But he had had his own strange experiences on themountain, and described it to Gray as “the most mysterious mountain I have everbeen on”. He told Gray of a day when he had climbed to the high pass of LairigGhru, above Ben MacDhui, and sat gazing down on the cliffs of Lurcher’s Cragwith its cascade of water. Then he found himself slipping into a “weird anddisagreeable” train of thought, so he stood up and walked. But the gloom turnedto a sense of deep depression and apathy. Then suddenly he became certain thathe was not alone. “Very close to me, permeating the air which moved so softly inthe summer’s wind, there was a Presence, utterly abstract but intensely real”.Then Frere noticed something else. “The silence of the mountain was violated byan intensely high singing note, a sound which was just within the auralcapacity, which never rose or fell . . . The sound, it seemed, was coming fromthe very soil of the mountains”. This sound continued until he was belowLurcher’s Crag, when the music became so faint that he was not sure whether itwas there at all. But the “abstract Presence” seemed to cling to him “with somesort of desperate eagerness as if it passionately desired to leave the mountainwhich it haunted . . .” Then there was a momentary flash of terror, and it wasgone.The experience of the strange, sustained note is not as unusual as Frereapparently thought. In her autobiography The Infinite Hive the eminent psychicalinvestigator Rosalind Heywood calls it “the Singing”. She describes it as “akind of continuous vibrant inner quasi-sound, to which the nearest analogy isthe noise induced by pressing a seashell against the ear, or perhaps the hum ofa distant dynamo”. Rosalind Heywood could hear “the Singing” fairly constantly –although very faintly – if she switched her full attention to it. She says that“it is far more evident in some places than in others; particularly so in aquiet wood, for instance, or on a moor or a mountain . . .” She notes that shealso hears it in churches and college libraries, “places where thought ordevotion have been intense for years”. She finds that “mountain Singing conveysa different “atmosphere” from church Singing, as an oboe conveys a different“atmosphere” from a trumpet”. And she says that she has met four other peoplewho have heard it; in one case, she mentioned it to a young engineer, convincedthat he was a thorough pragmatist; to her surprise, he replied, “Oh yes, I hearthat too, in places where there have just been strong emotions”. So to someextent the “Singing” seems to be a kind of “recording”: Rosalind Heywood saysthat she can also “feel” it when she goes into a room where intense thought hasbeen going on. Yet it cannot be wholly due to human “vibrations”, since shementions that the Hampstead tube station – the deepest in London – is the onlyplace where she has not heard it. “The silence was dead”.If “the Singing” can be heard in places where intense thought or worship hastaken place, this verifies that it could be regarded as some kind of“recording”. In the 1840s an American professor of anatomy named Joseph RodesBuchanan came to the interesting conclusion that every object has its ownhistory somehow “imprinted” on it, and that “psychics” can sense this history byholding it in their hands; he called this faculty “psychometry”. He observedthat handwritten letters seem to be particularly good “recorders” of thewriter’s state of mind, particularly if the writer was feeling some powerfulemotion at the time. In the early twentieth century the scientist and psychicalresearcher Sir Oliver Lodge advanced the theory that “ghosts” may be“recordings” – that the powerful emotions associated with some tragedy may beimprinted on the walls of the room in which it has taken place, so that a“sensitive” person who walked into the room would have a strange feeling ofmisery and oppression, or perhaps even see the tragedy re-enacted. A Cambridgedon named Tom Lethbridge suggested a very similar “tape recording” theory half acentury later. Lethbridge suggested that these “recordings” are imprinted onsome kind of electrical field, and he believed that mountains, deserts andwoodlands each have their own special type of “field”. (He seemed to feel thatthe field of water is the best “recorder”, so that ghosts are often associatedwith damp places).It seems conceivable, then, that when Rosalind Heywood heard “the Singing” shewas simply picking up some kind of electrical field – a field which, on accountof its properties, we might christen “the psychic field”. Why Richard Frereshould suddenly have become aware of this field on the slopes of Ben MacDhuimust remain an open question. But at least it seems to offer some kind ofconfirmation that his feeling of menace and depression was not merelyimagination.The episode in which Frere and Densham held a conversation with some invisibleentity seems even stranger; presumably they were responding to some “presence”on a subconscious level, almost as if dreaming. This could also explain whyFrere could not even remember the episode later.Frere also told Affleck Gray a curious story about a friend – whose identity hewas not at liberty to disclose – who decided to spend the night on Ben MacDhuito win a bet. He set up his tent by the summit cairn on a January night. (Thisis not a man-made cairn, but a natural formation eroded by the weather.) He alsobegan to experience the familiar sense of unreality, and “the morbidlyanalytical directioning of thought”. Frere explained: “He did not feel in anyway mad: the terror which possessed him concerned the imminent impact ofknowledge which he knew would always set him aside from his fellows. It was asif he was the unwilling recipient of a vast range of new revolutionary thoughtimpulses built up in some all-powerful mind. And the mind was neither human noranti-human; it just had nothing to do with him at all”.He fell asleep and woke up “to a fear of a more terrifying nature”. Moonlightfell through the crack of the flysheet of his tent, and as he stared at it hesaw a brown blur, and “knew that something lay between himself and the moon”. Helay there in frozen immobility until the shadow went away. He now pulled asidethe flysheet of the tent. “The night was brilliant. About twenty yards away agreat brown creature was swaggering down the hill. He used the word “swaggering”because the creature had an air of insolent strength about it”. His impressionwas that the creature was about twenty feet high, and was covered with shortishbrown hair. It was too erect to be a huge ape; it had a tapering waist and verybroad shoulders. Affleck Gray’s book contains a photograph of footprints in thesnow taken on Ben MacDhui, and they look oddly like the famous photograph of thefootprints of the “Abominable Snowman” discovered on the Menlung glacier onEverest by Eric Shipton in 1951.Frere was inclined to wonder whether the brown-haired creature was real, orwhether perhaps it was somehow created by his friend’s imagination in that oddly“unreal” state of mind.In her book The Secret of Spey the writer Wendy Wood describes her ownexperience on Ben MacDhui. She had reached the entrance to the pass of LairigGhru on a snowy day, and was preparing to return when she heard a voice “ofgigantic resonance” close behind her. “It seemed to speak with the harshconsonants and full vowels of the Gaelic”. She wondered if someone was lyinginjured in the snow, and tramped around in circles until she was convinced thatshe was alone. Now feeling afraid, she began to hurry back, and as she descendedthe mountain, thought she could hear footsteps following her. “She had a strangefeeling that something walked immediately behind her”. At first she thought itmight be echoes of her own footsteps, until she realized that the crunchingnoises did not exactly correspond with her steps. She asks in her book whetherperhaps the strange happenings on Ben MacDhui might be “the concretion of theimaginings of the race, clinging to a particular place, discernible only tothose whose racial sensitiveness is open to receive the primal impressions andfears of a bygone day”. In other words, she is suggesting that the “ghost” ofBen MacDhui is a “recording”.This seems to be confirmed, to some extent, by an experience recounted by thenovelist Joan Grant in her autobiography Time Out of Mind. Her book reveals herto be highly psychic. She and her husband were not even on Ben MacDhui but downbelow near Aviemore; Gray suggests they were on the Lairig Ghru path near CoylumBridge. For no apparent reason, she was suddenly overwhelmed with fear.“Something – utterly malign, four legged, and yet obscenely human, invisible andyet solid enough for me to hear the pounding of its hooves, was trying to reachme. If it did I should die for I was far too frightened to know how to defendmyself”. She fled in terror. “I had run about half a mile when I burst throughan invisible barrier behind which I knew I was safe. I knew I was safe now,though a second before I had been in mortal danger; knew it as certainly asthough I were a torero who has jumped the barrier in front of a charging bull”.What seems to be emerging from most of these stories about Ben MacDhui is thatthe chief manifestation is a sudden feeling of depression followed by panic.Joan Grant’s account underlines another important point. Tom Lethbridge, who hasalready been quoted, had observed repeatedly that these sudden unpleasantsensations of fear or “nastiness” seem to have a precisely defined area, so thatit is possible to step in or out of them in one single stride. He describes forexample how one day he and his wife Mina went to Ladram beach in Devon to gatherseaweed for the garden. At a point on the beach where a small stream flowed fromthe cliff both experienced an odd feeling of gloom. “I passed into a kind ofblanket, or fog, of depression, and, I think, of fear”. Mina Lethbridge went offto gather seaweed at the other end of the beach but soon hurried back. “I can’tstand this place any longer. There’s something frightful here”. The followingweek they returned, on another dull, grey day, and were again greeted by thesame feeling of depression – Tom compared it to a bad smell. It was at its worstaround the stream, making him feel almost giddy. Mina went to the cliff-top tomake a sketch, and had a sudden feeling that she was being urged to jump. Laterthey verified that someone had committed suicide from this precise spot.Tom noted that it was possible to step in and out of the “depression” – and henoticed it once again when the old lady next door died under strangecircumstances after an attempt to practise black magic. An “unpleasant” feelinghung around her house, but it was possible to step in and out of it, as if itwas some kind of invisible barrier, like Joan Grant’s bullring barrier.Gray recounts many stories that seem to support Lethbridge’s “tape recording”theory. The Scots poet James Hogg, known as the Ettrick Shepherd (because he wasa shepherd by profession), once saw a herd of Highland cattle on the far side ofthe stream, and since they had no right to be there he sent a shepherd to drivethem off the land, together with two more farmhands armed with cudgels. But theyfound no sign of a herd, or even of hoofmarks. No one had seen a herd of cattlein the district that day. It had been some kind of “mirage”, or perhaps a“recording” of something long past.Gray also quotes The Mountain Vision by the mountaineer Frank S. Smythe. Smythedescribes how, crossing the hills from Morvich to Loch Duich, on a bright sunnyday, with a wonderful panorama of cloud-dappled hills and the distant sea, heentered a grassy, sun-warmed defile and “became instantly aware of an aura ofevil” in the place. “It was as if something terrible had once happened there,and time had failed to dissipate the atmosphere created by it”.On impulse, Smythe decided to eat lunch there. As he smoked his pipe theatmosphere seemed to become increasingly unpleasant. Then, as he strove to bereceptive to the strange influence, he seemed to witness a massacre: a score orso of ragged people were straggling wearily through the defile when concealedmen rushed down on them with spears and axes, and killed them all. As Smythehurried on, he seemed to hear screams behind him. He was later able to confirmthat a massacre of Highlanders by British troops had taken place on the road,but he remained convinced that this is not what he had seen. “The weapons I saw,or seemed to see, were those of an earlier date”.Yet the many strange accounts of invisible presences on Ben MacDhui seems tothrow doubt on the notion that the “big grey man” is nothing more than a“recording”. George Duncan, an Aberdeen lawyer and a mountaineer, was totallyconvinced he had seen the devil on the slopes of the mountain. He and afellow-climber, James A. Parker, had descended from Devil’s Point, and weredriving in a dog cart along the Derry Road. Duncan said: “All at once, I got theshock of my life by seeing before me a tall figure in a black robe – theconventional figure of the Devil himself, waving his arms, clad in longdepending sleeves, coming towards me”. He seemed to see the figure surrounded bysmoke. In a few moments it passed from view as the cart went round a corner.James A. Parker verified the story. “It was only at dinner that evening he toldme that when we were about a mile below Derry Lodge he had looked up to thehillside on his right and seen the Devil about a quarter of a mile away wavinghis arms to him”.Perhaps the oddest and in some ways the most interesting explanation that Grayencountered was given by Captan Sir Hugh Rankin, Bart, and his wife. Rankin wasa Mahayana Buddhist, and his wife was a Zen Buddhist. He and Lady Rankin werecycling from Rothiemurchus to Mar via the Lairig Ghru pass, and although it wasJuly it was bitterly cold in the pass. At the Pools o’ Dee they suddenly felt“the Presence” behind them; they turned and saw a big, olive-complexioned mandressed in a long robe and sandals, with long flowing hair. “We were not in theleast afraid. Being Buddhists we at once knew who it was. We at once knelt andmade obeisance”. They had instantly recognized the stranger as a Bodhisattva,“one of the five ‘Perfected Men’ who control the destinies of this world, andmeet once a year in a cave in the Himalayas”. According to Sir Hugh, thePresence addressed them in a language he thought was Sanskrit, and he repliedrespectfully in Urdu. “All the time the Bodhisattva was with us [he gave thetime as about ten minutes] a heavenly host of musicians was playing high up inthe sky . . . Immediately the Bodhisattva left us the music ceased and we neverheard it again”. It sounds as if they had heard some version of “the Singing”.But his comment that the Presence spoke in Sanskrit raises the question ofwhether Wendy Wood had not mistaken Sanskrit for Gaelic when she heard it on themountain.Shortly before his death, F.W. Holiday, author of a classic book on the LochNess monster (see Chapter 18), advanced the startling theory that the Grey Man,like the Loch Ness monster and the Surrey puma, and possibly the AbominableSnowman of the Himalayas, is a member of “the phantom menagerie”, creatures whobelong to some other world or dimension. In The Goblin Universe (chapter 6) hecites various stories about the Fear Liath More (the Celtic name for the GreyMan), and goes on:> Pan, the goat-footed god, is not so funny when you encounter him . . . The> chief symptom of being in the presence of Pan is panic, which the Oxford> dictionary defines as “unreasoning and excessive terror, from Greek panicos,> of god Pan, reputed to cause panic . . .” The phenomenon is certainly not> localised to the Cairngorms. Hamish Corrie, when he was nearing the summit of> Sgurr Dearg on Skye, turned back when he was overcome by “an unaccountable> panic”.> > The late John Buchan reported the same effect in the Bavarian Alps. He describeshow in 1910 he was returning through a pinewood on a sunny morning with a localforester when panic struck them out of the blue. Both of them fled withoutspeaking until they collapsed from exhaustion on the valley highway below.Buchan comments that a friend of his “ran for dear life” when climbing inJotunheimen in Norway. The Pan effect may be worldwide.Holiday connects “the phantom menagerie” with Unidentified Flying Objects, andcites the authority on UFOs, John Keel, who began by assuming that UFOs are somekind of unknown aircraft, perhaps from other planets, and ended by acceptingthat they come from “another dimension”, and that they seem to have a distinctlysupernatural element. In one of his books, The Mothman Prophecies, Keel speaksof a gigantic winged figure sighted again and again in West Virginia, anddescribes his own feeling of “panic” on a road close to one of the sightings.Like Lethbridge, Keel found that the area of “panic” seemed to be sharplydefined, so that he could walk in and out of it with one stride. And the area ofsightings of “Mothman” also has many sightings of UFO phenomena.Oddly enough, Affleck Gray is willing to consider the “space visitors” theory asan explanation of the Ben MacDhui phenomena. He points out that in 1954 anex-taxi driver named George King inaugurated the Aetherius Society in CaxtonHall, London. King claimed that he had met the Master Jesus on Holdstone Down,North Devon, and been made aware that he had been chosen as the primary mentalchannel of certain Space Intelligences. He was told to travel the world, histask being to serve as the channel for “charging” eighteen mountains with cosmicenergy. One of these mountains was Creag an Leth-Choin, three miles north-westof Ben MacDhui, and King asserts that there is a huge dome-shaped auditorium, aretreat of the Great White Brotherhood, in the bowels of Ben MacDhui. Anothergroup of “seekers”, the Active Truth Academy in Edinburgh, also believe that BenMacDhui “has become the earth-fall for space beings”. But it is clear fromGray’s chapter on Space Beings that he regards this explanation with skepticism.If we wish for a “scientific” explanation of the Ben MacDhui phenomena, then thelikeliest seems to be that the answer lies in Ben MacDhui itself: that the“panic” is caused by some natural phenomenon, a kind of “earth force” which maybe connected with the earth’s magnetic field. There are areas of the earth’ssurface where birds lose their way because the lines of earth magnetism somehowcancel one another out, forming a magnetic vortex. “Ley-hunters” also believethat so-called “ley lines” – which connect sacred sites such as churches,barrows and standing stones – are basically lines of magnetic force. Many arealso convinced that places in which this force is exceptionally powerful arelikely to be connected with “supernatural” occurrences – in fact, that suchplaces “record” human emotions, producing the effects that are described as“hauntings”. This explanation would account for Frank Smythe’s experience of the“haunted” valley where the massacre had occurred.The non-scientific explanation may be sought in the belief of most primitivepeoples that the earth is alive, that certain places are holy, and that suchplaces are inhabited by spirits. The Western mind is inclined to dismiss suchbeliefs as superstition; but many travellers who have been in close contact withthem are inclined to be more open-minded. In The Lost World of the KalahariLaurens Van der Post tells how, when he was seeking the vanished Bushmen ofSouth Africa, his guide Samutchoso took him to a place called the SlipperyHills. The guide insisted that there must be no hunting as they approached thehills, or the gods would be angry. Van de Post forgot to tell his advance party,and they shot a warthog. From then on they ran into an endless stream of badluck. When Samutchoso tried to pray Van der Post saw that he was pulled overbackward by some unknown force. All their technical equipment began tomalfunction. Then Samutchoso “consulted” the spirits and began to speak toinvisible presences. He told Van der Post that they were angry, and would havekilled him if he had tried to pray again. Van der Post suggested that theyshould all write a message of apology, and that this should be buried in abottle at the foot of a sacred rock. Apparently this worked; the spirits werepropitiated, and suddenly the equipment ceased to malfunction. Through theguide, the “spirits” told Van der Post that he would find bad news waiting forhim when he reached the next place on his route. In fact his assistant found amessage saying that his father had died and he had to return home immediately.After all this, Van der Post had no doubt of the real existence of the “earthspirits” worshipped by primitive people.F.W.Holiday’s view was that the explanation of such phenomena as the “Grey Man”lay somewhere between these two sets of explanations: the scientific and the“supernatural”. But he believed that the Western mind will be capable ofgrasping the answer only when it has broadened its conception of science."},{"pageContent":"20 Kaspar HauserThe Boy from NowhereThe case of Kaspar Hauser is perhaps the greatest of nineteenth-centuryhistorical mysteries. But it is rather more than that. The unfortunate youth wasthe subject of a cruel experiment in what would now be called “sensorydeprivation”, and the results of this experiment were in some ways moreinteresting than the admittedly fascinating enigma of Kaspar’s identity.On Whit Monday, 26 May 1828, the Unschlitt Square in Nuremberg was almostdeserted, most people being in the surrounding countryside enjoying the Ausflug(or holiday excursion). At about five in the afternoon a weary-looking youthdragged himself into the square, and almost fell into the arms of the localcobbler, George Weichmann. He was well built, but poorly dressed, and walked ina curious, stiff-limbed manner. Weichmann took the letter that the youth heldout to him, and saw that it was addressed to the captain of the 4th Squadron,6th Cavalry Regiment. The lad seemed to be unable to answer questions, replyingin a curious mumble – Weichmann suspected he was drunk. He led the youth to thenearest guardroom, and the sergeant in charge took him to the captain’s home.When Captain Wessenig came home a few hours later he found the place in a stateof excitement. The youth seemed to be an idiot. He had tried to touch a candleflame with his fingers, and screamed when he was burned. Offered beer and meat,he had stared at them as if he had no idea what to do with them; yet he hadfallen ravenously on a meal of black bread and water. The grandfather clockseemed to terrify him. The only words the boy seemed to know were “Weiss nicht”– I don’t know.The envelope proved to contain two letters. The first began: “Honoured Captain.I send you a lad who wishes to serve his king in the army. He was brought to meon October 7, 1812. I am but a poor labourer with children of my own to rear.His mother asked me to bring up the boy . . . Since then I have never let him gooutside the house”. The letter had no signature. The other note stated: “Thischild has been baptised. His name is Kaspar; you must give him a second nameyourself. His father was a cavalry soldier. When he is seventeen take him toNuremberg to the Sixth Cavalry regiment: his father belonged to it. He was bornon April 30, 1812. I am a poor girl; I can’t take care of him. His father isdead”. This was presumably the letter that had accompanied Kaspar when he hadbeen handed over to the “poor labourer”.Taken to the police station, the boy accepted a pencil and wrote “KasparHauser”. But to other questions he answered “Don’t know”.It all seemed straightforward enough – an illegitimate child left on someone’sdoorstep and brought up by a kind stranger. But in that case why keep himindoors for seventeen years? The boy’s feet were so tender – he was bleedingthrough his shoes – because he was unaccustomed to walking on them. His skin waspale, as if he had been confined in darkness. Moreover, on close examination itbecame clear that the two letters had been written by the same hand at about thesame time, not sixteen years apart. The clothes he was wearing looked as if theyhad been taken from a scarecrow, and they were obviously not his own. Someonewas trying to draw a red herring across the trail.The boy was locked in a cell, and his gaoler observed that he seemed perfectlycontented to sit there for hours without moving. He had no sense of time, andseemed to know nothing about hours and minutes. It soon became clear that he hada small vocabulary. He could say that he wanted to become a Reiter (cavalryman)like his father – a phrase he had obviously been taught like a parrot. To everyanimal he applied the word “horse”, and he seemed to be fascinated by horses.When a visitor – one of the crowd who flocked to stare at him every day – gavehim a toy one he adorned it with ribbons, played with it for hours, andpretended to feed it at every meal. The audience caused him no concern, and hecaused amusement by performing his natural functions quite openly, with no senseof shame. He did not even seem to know the difference between men and women – hereferred to both as “boys” (Junge).One of the most curious things about him was his incredible physical acuteness.He began to vomit if coffee or beer was in the same room; the sight and smell ofmeat produced nausea. The smell of wine literally made him drunk, and a singledrop of brandy in his water made him sick. His hearing and eyesight wereabnormally acute – in fact, he could see in the dark, and would laterdemonstrate his ability by reading from a Bible in a completely black room. Hewas so sensitive to magnets that he could tell whether the north or south polewas turned towards him. He could distinguish between different metals by passinghis hand over them, even when they were covered with a cloth. (A few yearslater, the American doctor Joseph Rodes Buchanan would stumble upon the facultyhe called psychometry (see Chapter 43) when he learned that many of his studentscould do the same thing.)At first Kaspar seemed to be an imbecile; he lived in a daze. Like an animal, hewas terrified of thunderstorms. But the notion that he was mentally retardedsoon had to be abandoned. The attention of his visitors obviously gave himpleasure, and he became visibly more alert day by day – exactly like a babylearning from experience. His vocabulary increased from day to day, and hisphysical clumsiness vanished – he learned to use scissors, quill pens andmatches. And as his intelligence increased, his features altered. He had struckmost people as a typical idiot, coarse, lumpish, clumsy and oddly repulsive; nowhis facial characteristics seemed to change and become more refined. But hecontinued to walk rather clumsily: in the place at the back of the knees wheremost of us have a hollow he had protrusions, so that when he sat withoutstretched legs, the whole leg was in contact with the ground.As he learned to speak he was gradually able to tell something of his own story.But it seemed to make the mystery even more baffling. A bulletin issued byBurgomeister Binder and the town council of Nuremberg stated that for as long asKaspar could remember he had lived in a small room, about seven feet long byfour feet wide, and its windows were boarded up. There was no bed, only a bundleof straw on the bare earth. The ceiling was so low that he could not standupright. He saw no one. When he woke up he would find bread and water in hiscell. Sometimes his water had a bitter taste, and he would go into a deep sleep;when he woke his straw would have been changed and his hair and nails cut. Theonly toys were three wooden horses. One day a man had entered his room andtaught him to write his name, Kaspar Hauser, and to repeat phrases like “I wantto be a soldier” and “Don’t know”. One day he woke up to find himself wearingthe baggy garments in which he had been found, and the man came and led him intothe open air. As they trudged along the man promised him a big, live horse whenhe was a soldier. Then he was abandoned somewhere near the gates of Nuremberg.Suddenly Kaspar was famous; his case was discussed all over Germany. This mustdoubtless have worried whoever was responsible for turning him loose; hiscaptor, or captors, had hoped that he would vanish quietly into the army and beforgotten; now he was a national celebrity, and everyone was asking questions.The Burgomaster and town council decided to take Kaspar under their protection;he would be fed and clothed at the municipal expense. In the rather dull town ofNuremberg he was an object of endless interest, and everyone wanted to solve themystery. The town paid for thousands of handbills appealing for clues to hisidentity, and even offering a reward. The police made a careful search of thelocal countryside for his place of imprisonment, which was obviously withinwalking distance; but they found nothing.The town council also appointed a guardian for its celebrity, a lecturer andscientist named Georg Friedrich Daumer. He was interested in “animal magnetism”,and it was he who conducted the tests that revealed that Kaspar coulddistinguish the poles of a magnet and read in the dark. Under Daumer’s tutelageKaspar finally developed into a young man of normal intelligence. Like anyteenager, he enjoyed being the centre of attention. His appearance became almostfoppish, and in the last months of his life he looked not unlike Roman busts ofNero, with his plump face and little curls.One of the many learned men who examined him was the lawyer and criminologistAnselm Ritter von Feuerbach, distinguished author of the Bavarian penal code;and he reached the interesting conclusion that Kaspar must be of royal blood.There could be no other explanation for the boy’s long imprisonment; he must besomebody’s heir. Kaspar was obviously not displeased at this notion.Then, a mere seventeen months after he had been “found”, someone tried to killhim. It happened on the afternoon of 7 October 1829, when Kaspar was found lyingon the floor of the cellar of Daumer’s house, bleeding from a head-wound, withhis shirt torn to the waist. Later he described being attacked by a man wearinga silken mask, who had struck him either with a club or a knife. The policeimmediately made a search of Nuremberg, but had no success in finding anyone whofitted Kaspar’s description of his assailant. There were those in Nuremberg whomuttered that there had never been an assailant, and that Kaspar had inventedthe whole episode to attract attention. Not everyone believed, as Daumer did,that Kaspar was some sort of angel. But most people took the view that his lifewas in danger. He was moved to a new address, and two policemen were appointedto look after him; Ritter von Feuerbach was appointed his guardian. And for thenext two years Kaspar vanished from the public eye. But not from the publicmind. Now the novelty had worn off, there were many in Nuremberg who objected tosupporting Kaspar on the rates.Then a solution was proposed that satisfied everyone. A wealthy and eccentricEnglishman, Lord Stanhope – nephew of the former prime minister Pitt – becameinterested in Kaspar and came to interview him. The two seemed to take aninstant liking to one another; they began to dine out in restaurants, and Kasparwas often to be seen in Lord Stanhope’s carriage. Stanhope was convinced thatKaspar was of royal blood, and was evidently fascinated by the mystery. When heoffered to take Kaspar off on a tour of Europe the town council was delighted.And from 1831 until 1833 Kaspar was exhibited at many minor courts of Europe,where he never failed to arouse interest. But various members of the Bavarianroyal houses, particularly that of Baden, threatened lawsuits if their nameswere publicly linked with Kaspar’s . . .It seems that all this attention and good living was not good for Kaspar’scharacter; predictably, he became vain, difficult and conceited. Stanhope becamedisillusioned with him. In 1833, back in Nuremberg, Stanhope asked permission tolodge him in the town of Ansbach, twenty-five miles away, where he would betutored by Stanhope’s friend Dr Meyer, and guarded by a certain Captain Hickel,a security officer. Then, feeling that he had done his duty, Stanhopedisappeared back to England.Kaspar was not happy in Ansbach. It was even more of a backwater than Nuremberg– in fact, Nuremberg was a glittering metropolis by comparison. Kaspar resentedbeing made to do lessons, particularly Latin, and longed for the old life ofcourts and dinner parties. His homesickness became stronger after a brief visitto Nuremberg. He seems to have felt that Ansbach was hardly better than the cellin which he had spent his early years.Then, only a few days before Christmas, he died. On 14 December 1833, on a snowyafternoon, he staggered into Mayer’s house gasping: “Man stabbed . . . knife . .. Hofgarten . . . gave purse . . . Go look quickly”. A hastily summoned doctordiscovered that Kaspar had been stabbed in the side, just below the ribs. Theblow had damaged his lung and liver. Hickel rushed to the park where Kaspar hadbeen walking, and found a silk purse containing a note, written inmirror-writing. It said: “Hauser will be able to tell you how I look, whence Icame and who I am. To spare him from that task I will tell you myself. I am from. . . on the Bavarian border . . . On the River . . . My name is M.L.O”.But Kaspar could not tell them anything about the man’s identity. He could onlyexplain that he had received a message through a labourer, asking him to go tothe Hofgarten. A tall, bewhiskered man wearing a black cloak had asked him, “Areyou Kaspar Hauser”? and when he nodded handed him the purse. As Kaspar took itthe man stabbed him, then ran off.Hickel revealed a fact that threw doubt on this story; there had only been oneset of footprints – Kaspar’s – in the snow. But when two days later, on 17December, Kaspar slipped into a coma his last words were: “I didn’t do itmyself”.His death was a signal for a flood of books and pamphlets, each with its owntheory about the mystery. Feuerbach published a book called Example of a CrimeAgainst the Soul of a Man, arguing that Kaspar must be of royal blood. To avoidlibel, he avoided naming any suspects, but his readers had no difficultysupplying their own names. The favourite candidates were the Grand Dukes ofBaden. The old Duke Karl Frederick had contracted a morganatic marriage with apretty eighteen-year-old, Caroline Geyer, who was rumoured to have poisoned hissons by an earlier marriage to make sure her own children became the futureGrand Dukes. Kaspar Hauser was supposed to have been one of these children. Thestory was obviously absurd, for it would have meant stealing him away as a babyand handing him over to a “minder”. One suggestion was that this “minder” was aman named Franz Richter, and that Kaspar’s childhood home was Castle Pilsach,near Nuremberg. (The castle is in fact merely a large farmhouse.) It wassuggested that Richter had decided to send Kaspar Hauser to Nuremberg when hiswife died. But there is no conclusive evidence for this view, or for any othertheory of Kaspar’s origin.There is of course no evidence whatsoever that Kaspar was of royal blood. If hewas the legitimate heir to some throne, or even to some rich estate, it isdifficult to understand why he should be kept in a small room all his life; itwould have been enough to hand him over to a “minder” in some distant place.Kaspar’s strange and inhuman treatment sounds more typical of ignorant peasantsthan of guilt-stricken aristocrats. In a Cornish case of the twentieth century,an army deserter of the First World War, William Garfield Rowe, was keptconcealed in his family’s farmhouse for thirty years. It does not seem to havestruck anyone that this was a kind of insanity – far worse than the few months’imprisonment he might have suffered if he had given himself up.5[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2234282] The theorythat Kaspar was the step-child of some wicked Grand Duke seems on the whole lesslikely than that he was the illegitimate child of some respectable farmer’sdaughter who was engaged to a local landowner, and was terrified that her secretwould become local gossip.In that case, who was behind the attacks? It is just possible that they neverhappened. After the first attack, in Daumer’s cellar, Nuremberg gossip suggestedthat his wound was self-inflicted, and that Kaspar was trying to draw attentionto himself after the failure of his recently published Autobiography. By thetime the second attack occurred his fame was in decline, and he was desperatelyunhappy about his situation.It is important to try to gain some insight into the psychology of a boy who hasspent the first seventeen years of his life in a kind of prison cell. Most boyslove being the centre of attention and will go to great lengths to achieve it.(Mark Twain shows how deeply he understands the mentality in the episode whereTom Sawyer pretends to be drowned, and attends his own funeral.) Most boys cravethe approval of adults, and will tell lies to get it. In his book about Kaspar,Jacob Wassermann describes how disappointed Daumer felt when he discovered thatKaspar was not as truthful as he seemed. Kaspar emerged quite literally fromobscurity, to find himself the centre of sympathetic attention – in fact aEuropean celebrity. But although his chronological age was seventeen, he was inthe most basic sense a two-year-old boy. Intellectually speaking, he grew withastonishing rapidity; emotionally speaking, he remained a child. So it isperfectly conceivable that he was prepared to go to desperate lengths to retainpublic sympathy.In the light of this suspicion, Kaspar’s story of both attacks begins to seemimplausible. Would a masked man somehow find his way into the basement ofDaumer’s house, then merely hit Kaspar on the head with a club (or a knife;there seems to be some conflict about the weapon) and rush away without makingsure he was dead? As to the second attack, could Hickel have been mistaken whenhe asserted that there were only one set of footprints in the snow? And why wasthe mysterious letter written in mirror writing? Was it because Kaspar wrote itwith his left hand, looking in a mirror, in order to disguise his writing? (Itis a well-known fact that it is easy to train the left hand to write backward,using a mirror.) Why was the message so nonsensical: “Hauser will be able totell you how I look, whence I came and who I am . . .” etc. Why should a paidassassin write a letter at all? Is it not more likely that Kaspar, in adesperate state of unhappiness, decided to inflict a harmless wound, and stabbedhimself too deeply?If so, Kaspar at least achieved what he wanted – universal sympathy and a placein the history books."},{"pageContent":"21 Rudolf HessWas It Hitler’s Deputy Who Died in Spandau Prison?On 17 August 1987, the man referred to as Prisoner Number 7 committed suicide byhanging in Berlin’s Spandau Prison. The prison records gave his real name asRudolf Walter Richard Hess, aged ninety-three years – the last member of theNazi high command to be held in that prison.Hess had been Hitler’s deputy and personal secretary and was third in line tothe Führership. Then, in 1941, only a few weeks before the launch of the Germanattack on the Soviet Union, he vanished from Berlin and flew to Scotland as aself-appointed peace ambassador. The result of that well-meant mission was alifetime of imprisonment. At the time of his death he had been incarcerated foralmost forty-six years, had been convicted of preparing and waging aggressivewar, and had attempted suicide several times. Ignoring complaints byhuman-rights groups, the Soviet Union insisted that Hess be held in prison untilhe died – the real motive being to maintain that nation’s access to West Berlin,where Spandau Prison was situated.For more than ten years before his suicide, there had been odd rumors thatPrisoner Number 7 was not Hess at all but a double, planted on the British forreasons unknown. The findings of a prison doctor in 1973, in fact, seem to provethat the prisoner was not Hess. But why, if that were true, would he have keptthe secret so long and at such cost? Why would the authorities have imprisonedan innocent man for nearly half a century? Close scrutiny of the facts throws upa number of bizarre anomalies that suggest that, as absurd as it sounds, Number7 may not, after all, have been Hitler’s deputy.Shortly before eleven o’clock on the night of Saturday, May 10, 1941, DavidMaClean, the head plowman at Floor’s Farm, outside Eaglesham near Glasgow, wasstartled by a tremendous roar that shook the whole cottage. Rushing outside, hesaw that an aircraft had crashed in a nearby field; he also saw a lone parachutedescending in the moonlight. Unarmed, MaClean ran across the field and found theparachutist disentangling himself from his harness – hampered somewhat by atwisted ankle. MaClean, keeping his distance, called, “Who are you? Are youGerman”? The pilot, a big man, pulled himself upright with some difficulty andreplied, “Yes, I am German. My name is Hauptmann Alfred Horn. I want to go toDungavel House. I have an important message for the Duke of Hamilton”.The “Hauptmann” gave no trouble and waited quietly until a constable arrived andtook him into custody. He was held at the local home guard headquarters for afew hours, then was transferred to the Mayhill Barracks in Glasgow. Whenquestioned, he simply repeated his name and insisted that he must see the Dukeof Hamilton on a matter of urgency.The next morning this information was passed on to the Duke, who was then awing-commander with the city of Glasgow (bomber) squadron. Together with an RAFintelligence officer, he hurried immediately to interview the captured pilot –who was by then laid up in bed with a painfully swollen ankle. After theintroductions the prisoner insisted on speaking to the Duke alone. Theintelligence officer obligingly went outside; as soon as they were alone, theprisoner greeted the Duke of Hamilton as an acquaintance. He explained that theyhad met in Germany during the 1936 Olympics and that the Duke had even attendeda luncheon party at his house. When Hamilton continued to look puzzled, the“Hauptmann” said, “I do not know if you recognize me, but I am Rudolf Hess”.Hamilton was staggered. If the man before him was indeed Hess – and theresemblance was striking – it meant that they had captured the deputy Führer ofthe Nazi Party – one of the top men in the Nazi high command and third in lineto Hitler himself. Yet why would one of the most powerful men in Europe risk hislife by flying into an enemy country at night and then hand himself over as ifhe were a common criminal hoping for amnesty?Hess went on to explain that he was on a “mission of humanity”; a diplomaticerrand of the highest importance, carrying a message that could save thousands,perhaps millions of lives. He was here, he told the astonished duke, to try tonegotiate peace between Britain and Germany.Rudolf Hess had the reputation of being the most intellectual member of Hitler’sinner circle. Born in 1894 in Egypt, he had been schooled in Germany and hadimmediately volunteered for active service at the outbreak of war in 1914. Shotthrough the left lung on the Rumanian front in 1917, he was given a medicaldischarge from the army, but after a six-month recovery period he joined theImperial Flying Corps. He successfully completed pilot training in time to serveonly ten days before the armistice.The National Socialist Workers Party, led by a spellbinding orator named AdolfHitler, consisted mainly of ex-servicemen who felt that the peace had betrayedthem. Hess joined in 1920, the year Hitler took over the leadership. He quicklyachieved prominence and in 1923 helped Hitler plan the attempted overthrow ofthe Bavarian government – later known as the “Beerhall Putsch”. When thisfailed, and Hitler was arrested, Hess fled the country. After a spectacularself-defense that was virtually a condemnation of his judges, Hitler wassentenced by a sympathetic court to five years’ imprisonment but was offered aconsiderably reduced sentence if he remained on good behavior. When he heard thenews, Hess returned of his own free will and gave himself up. He was sentencedto an eighteen-month term and sent to serve his time with Hitler in theLandsberg fortress.During their imprisonment Hitler and Hess kept busy, Hitler writing a book andHess acting as his secretary. It is certain that Hess had an important influenceon the development of ideas in Mein Kampf; he had a better intellectual andacademic training than Hitler and had already developed his own strong views onGerman racial purity and the need for territorial expansion. The two worked welltogether, and the foundations of Hess’s future influence in the Nazi Party werelaid.When Hitler won an election and became Reichschancellor in 1933, Hess wasappointed his deputy, and during the establishment of the totalitariandictatorship he was never far from Hitler’s side. But when Hess announced plansto make the first east-west trans-Atlantic flight, Hitler turned down thescheme, insisting that Hess was too valuable to the Reich to risk his life.In February 1938 Hess was appointed head of a department whose purpose was tomake secret plans for the war of German expansion, which broke out a year later.Hess is known to have advocated expansion eastward, into Poland and then intothe Soviet Union, but he was strongly against war on two fronts. And when Francecapitulated in 1940, he seems to have decided that Germany’s new westernfrontier was reasonably secure and that therefore the war with Great Britain wasdangerous and unnecessary. The question was, would Hess have felt stronglyenough about the subject to risk his own life to make peace, and would such amadcap scheme have had Hitler’s backing?Although stating that he was acting on his own initiative, the man who claimedto be Hess insisted to Hamilton that he was speaking for Hitler in all but name.The Führer had never wanted to go to war with the British Empire, he said.Britain’s impending total defeat – and in 1941 many people thought thisincreasingly likely – was something Hitler truly wished to avoid. There was achance now for the nations to come to peace and perhaps even to join forces tosmash the threat from Communist Russia. He was there to try to put an immediatestop to the war.Hamilton asked him why he had specifically asked to see him, and the prisonerreplied that a mutual friend, Dr Albrecht Haushofer, had recommended the duke asa man who would support his peace initiative. To back this he pointed out thatamong his confiscated belongings were the visiting cards of Haushofer and hisfather, Professor Karl Haushofer. He also mentioned a letter that AlbrechtHaushofer had sent to the Duke, inviting him to a secret diplomatic meeting inneutral Portugal.The Duke had indeed received this letter, after it had been intercepted andinvestigated by M15, but he was still dubious about the identity of theprisoner. For one thing, he was carrying no identification other than thevisiting cards and some photographs of Rudolf Hess as a small child – a very oddchoice of material to back such an incredible story.It all seemed beyond belief. Capturing Rudolf Hess – under any circumstances –was almost too good to be true, and it occurred to Hamilton that it might be atrick using a look-alike, in order to sound out the British government’swillingness to continue fighting. Even so, he found himself more than halfbelieving that the prisoner was indeed Hess, but he was careful not to give thisaway during the interview.The Duke, wary of using the telephone system, flew to inform Churchill inperson. Ushered in to see the Prime Minister a few hours later, he told hisstrange story. Churchill exclaimed, “Do you mean to tell me that the DeputyFührer of Germany is in our hands? . . . Well, Hess or no Hess, I’m going to seethe Marx Brothers”! Which in fact he did – The Marx Brothers Go West – at alocal cinema.On his return he interrogated Hamilton more thoroughly. The Duke said that themore he thought about the secret letter from Dr Haushofer, the more certain hewas that only the real Hess could have known about it. Hess was known to be aclose associate of Haushofer, and it was quite possible that the letter had beensent on his orders. If this was the case, or even if Hess had simply condonedthe letter, it was highly unlikely that he would broadcast the fact to hiscolleagues, many of whom would have argued that it was treason. After athree-hour session, Churchill sat deep in thought and was heard to mutter, “Theworm is in the bud”.The next day Hamilton, who admitted that his memory of meeting Hess in 1936 wasa dim one, was sent back to Glasgow with Ivone Kirkpatrick, a man who had servedas First Secretary to the embassy in Berlin from 1933 to 1938 and had met Hesson many occasions. When they landed they were greeted by a call from the ForeignSecretary, Anthony Eden. The following broadcast had just been sent out onGerman public radio:> On Saturday 10th May Rudolf Hess set out at 18:00 hours on a flight from> Augsburg from which he has so far not returned. A letter that he left behind> unfortunately shows by its distraction traces of a mental disorder, and it is> feared that he was a victim of hallucinations . . . In the circumstances it> must be considered that party member Hess either crashed or met with an> accident.> > Hamilton and Kirkpatrick were told that the Ministry of Information was shortlygoing to release a statement headed “Rudolf Hess in England”. The Britishgovernment was committing itself.If this was indeed some cunning Nazi trick, then Hitler was playing for highstakes. The real Hess might have dropped out of sight for a while to give animpostor a chance to convince the British, but Hess’s public credibility wouldbe destroyed in Germany if the “mission” came to nothing. And if this were tohappen, the Nazi high command would have to admit that they had been attemptinga confidence trick on the highest diplomatic level; the loss of face to theparty as a whole would be enormous. Since nobody could imagine what such a plotmight achieve that would be worth such a risk, it seemed logical that the simpleexplanation – that Hess had flown to England without Hitler’s knowledge – wasthe only possible one.The prisoner did not recognize Kirkpatrick when they were first introduced, butas they talked he seemed to remember him and mentioned several incidents theyhad witnessed together in Germany. This convinced Kirkpatrick and Hamilton thatthey were talking to Hess. Then, just as the interview was becoming morerelaxed, the prisoner drew out a large packet of manuscript notes and launchedinto a four-hour diatribe on the subject of Anglo-German historical relationsand the unfairness of Britain’s declaration of war on Germany.The exhausted Kirkpatrick later telephoned the Foreign Office, to be told thatChurchill had definitely ruled out any possibility of negotiating with theDeputy Führer. To do so might be interpreted, by friend and foe alike, asunwillingness to fight – perhaps just the result the Nazis were hoping for.Hess, said Churchill, was to be treated as a prisoner of war and nothing else.He was to be told that if, after the war, he was found guilty of war crimes, hisrepentance would stand in his favour; other than that the British government hadno interest in him.After eighteen months of imprisonment, Hess began to show signs of mentalillness; he complained that his food was being poisoned and made a number ofsuicide attempts. He was moved to a mental hospital and held there for the restof the war.It was now generally accepted that the prisoner was Rudolf Hess – even hismental illness seemed to support the Nazi statement that he had been sufferingfrom a breakdown at the time of his flight. Yet an observant doctor might havenoted reasons for doubt. To begin with, Hess insisted that he was suffering fromperiodic bouts of amnesia, which made it impossible for him to answer questionsabout himself. But he also seemed to have undergone a personality change. TheDeputy Führer had been known to be obsessed with his health. Like Hitler, he hadbeen a strict vegetarian, who refused even to eat eggs, fried foods, or anyproducts grown with artificial fertilizer, considering them “impure”. He wasknown to have eaten with fastidious care and to have been punctiliously neat andtidy. In confinement in England, he ate anything set before him voraciously andmessily and seemed to have lost all interest in his appearance.While held in Britain he was allowed to write to his wife, Ilsa Hess, vianeutral Switzerland. She later said that the handwriting seemed to be that ofher husband and that she never had any doubts that that was who he was. What didbother her occasionally was that her husband seemed to be desperately trying toprove to her that he was Rudolf Hess.The war ended; in October 1945 the prisoner was transferred to Nuremberg,Germany, to face the War Crimes Tribunal. On his arrival he seemed to suffer atotal memory breakdown and was judged incapable of standing trial. The doctorstried to jog his memory by introducing him to old colleagues; but although heshowed some sign of recognition when confronted by his two secretaries, hefailed to recognize Hermann Göring or Karl Haushofer, the father of the man whohad recommended that he seek out the Duke of Hamilton.Perhaps understandably, the prisoner was also in poor physical shape. Hess hadonce been a large, well-built man in excellent health. He was now gaunt andsickly; although in defense of his jailers it should be noted that he hadalready been in poor physical condition when captured.As the authorities wrangled over his mental competence, the prisoner suddenlyissued the following statement;> Henceforth my memory will again respond to the outside world. The reasons why> I simulated loss of memory were tactical. The fact is that it is only my> ability to concentrate that is somewhat reduced. However, my capacity to> follow the trial, to defend myself, to put questions to witnesses, or even to> answer questions is not being affected thereby.> > He subsequently stood trial, and though clearly tired and less than fully alert,gave a reasonable account of himself. On September 2, 1946, he was found guiltyof conspiracy and crimes against peace. Since it could not be proved that he hadknown about the death camps, he was acquitted of the charge of war crimes.Together with Walter Funk, Admiral Donitz, Admiral Raeder, Baldur von Schirach,Constantin von Naurath, and Albert Speer, Rudolf Hess was sentenced to lifeimprisonment in Spandau Prison in West Berlin. There he was simply referred toas Prisoner Number 7.Throughout the trial and for the next twenty-three years, the prisoner declinedto see his wife or his only son. When he finally agreed to allow Ilsa Hess tovisit him, she expressed surprise that his voice had deepened – it might havebeen expected to become higher with increasing age.Spandau Prison was an oddly anomalous product of the cold war. Situated in theBritish-occupied section of West Berlin, it was administered by the four majorvictorious powers: the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.Under a special convention drawn up for the prison, control of the prisonalternated between these four nations every month; this included a total changeof guard.In the course of time the other six prisoners were released, the last two beingvon Schirach and Speer in 1966. But Prisoner Number 7 was offered no hope ofrelease. The Soviets made it clear that they would block any such move and thatHess was to remain imprisoned until he died.There were two reasons for this. First, the Soviet people felt particularlybitter toward Hess, who had collabourated with Hitler on the plan to conquer andenslave them. But the main reason was undoubtedly that Hess’s release wouldinvolve the Soviets losing their foothold in West Berlin, and with it,presumably, all kinds of opportunities for spying.And so, on 17 August 1987, the last Spandau prisoner committed suicide byhanging at the age of ninety-three. But for at least fourteen years before that,there were very real doubts about his identity. In 1972 Dr Hugh Thomas wasappointed consultant in general surgery at the British Military Hospital inBerlin. Three years earlier, in 1969, Hess had almost died when a duodenal ulcerperforated, and his Russian captors allowed several days to pass before sendingfor a doctor; now Thomas insisted on giving him a complete medical checkup –although it was not until the following year, 1973, that he was finally allowedto examine Hess in the presence of representatives of all four powers. Thomaswas revolted by the inhumanity toward Hess shown by Voitov, the Sovietcommandant; any attempt to show sympathy was immediately met by a command of“Stop that! It is contrary to the Nuremberg convention”.What Thomas now discovered puzzled him deeply. Hess had been wounded in thechest in the First World War, and the resultant lung injury had caused him muchbronchial trouble in the days when he was Hitler’s deputy. Now there was no signof a war wound and no bronchial trouble. Examination of Hess’s medical recordsmade it clear that there should have been many scars from war wounds, none ofwhich was visible on the body of the Spandau prisoner. When, at a secondexamination, Thomas asked him, “What happened to your war wounds”?, Hessblanched, began to tremble, then muttered, “Too late, too late”. What did thatmean? That there would now be no point in admitting that he was not Rudolf Hess?Thomas concluded that it was impossible that this prisoner – who had beencode-named “Jonathan” when in England – could be Hess. X-rays should at leasthave shown signs of tissue scarring, but there were none.Thomas went on to study the documents concerning Hess’s flight to Scotland andconcluded that it should have been impossible for a Messerschmitt 110D to carryenough fuel to make the 850-mile journey if it had included as many detours asHess claimed. The range of the aircraft – on full tanks – was only a little morethan 850 miles. It could possibly have been carrying spare tanks under thewings, but Hess’s adjutant, Pintsch, had taken a photograph of the plane as ittook off, and it showed no spare fuel tanks.In his book The Murder of Rudolf Hess, Dr Thomas suggests that Hess never leftGermany; rather, he died there and was replaced by a double. The commander offighter squadrons along the Dutch coast, Adolf Galland, tells in his book TheFirst and Last how, on the night of Hess’s flight, Hermann Göring – who loathedHess – rang him and ordered him to intercept an aircraft flying out of Germany,claiming, “The Deputy Führer has gone mad and is flying to England . . . He mustbe brought down”. But Galland’s planes were unable to locate Hess’sMesserschmitt.What do we know to support the notion that Hess flew to Britain on a peacemission? To begin with, it is clear that Hitler wanted peace. He was known toadmire the British and would have preferred them as allies rather than enemies;Russia was his real target. On 25 June 1940, Hitler made a speech in which heappealed to England from a position of strength (“since I am not thevanquished”) for peace “in the name of reason”. Churchill rejected this offer.But Hess is known to have favoured a direct appeal to the British. One of hisclosest friends was the aforementioned Albrecht Haushofer, whose father, Karl,had been Hess’s personal adviser in the mid-1930s and was sent on a number ofdiplomatic missions. It seems certain that he knew about Hess’s plans to appealdirectly to the British. On the day after Hess’s adjutant Pintsch deliveredHess’s “farewell” letter to Hitler at Berchtesgaden, describing his peacemission, Albrecht Haushofer was summoned to write an account of his own attemptsto make contact with the British to make peace. Unfortunately, Albrecht wasmurdered by the S.S. in the last days of the war, so the one witness who mighthave been able to tell the truth about the prisoner in Spandau was silenced.But if we know that Hess wanted to make peace, and even that he went to talk tothe Duke of Windsor in Lisbon in July 1940, why should we doubt that it was Hesswho landed in Scotland on 10 May 1941? Because, as we have seen, the medicalevidence suggests that the prisoner code-named “Jonathan” was not the man whoreceived so many wounds in World War I. If “Hauptmann” Horn was Hess, why was hecarrying so little documentation, so few papers to establish his identity? Whydid he refuse to see his wife and son for twenty-three years after beingincarcerated in Spandau?Thomas’s theory, briefly, is this: Göring detested Hess and would have been gladto see him dead. And Heinrich Himmler, head of the S.S., is known to havenurtured plans to replace Hitler. For either of them, Hess’s death would havebeen a bonus. But if Hess was murdered on his peace flight – or intercepted andshot down – Hitler would have been unforgiving. It was important that “Hess”should arrive. So when Hess’s planned flight became known to Göring, a doublewas found and carefully schooled. And when Hess had been eliminated – sometimeon that night of 9–10 May 1941 – the double was hastily sent off, probably froma Danish airfield. This is why the Duke of Hamilton did not recognize him. Thisis why he began feigning loss of memory at the earliest opportunity.But British intelligence must have found out very soon that he was not RudolfHess. This could explain why the British made no attempts to use their prisonerfor propaganda purposes.Then, why did Hess’s double not reveal his secret after the war? Thomas speaksof Himmler’s known habit of eliminating whole families of “traitors” to theReich. This would have explained the double’s silence before Himmler’s death –before the Nuremberg trials began. And after that, he may either have continuedto believe his family to be in danger from ex-Nazis or simply have assumed thathe stood no chance of being believed. If, in fact, he had been virtuallybrainwashed during a series of breakdowns and suicide attempts, and mentalexhaustion, he may simply have settled into the state of blank indifference thatis sometimes seen in the very old.Whatever the reason, it seems clear that Prisoner Number 7 recognized that itwas “too late, too late” when Dr Thomas finally began asking the rightquestions."},{"pageContent":"22 The Holy Shroud of TurinThe notion that a fourteen-foot oblong of cloth preserved in the Cathedral ofTurin could be the shroud in which the founder of Christianity was laid in thetomb seems on the face of it an obvious absurdity, particularly since the Turinshroud had forty-odd rivals in other parts of Europe. Yet if the “Holy Shroud”is a fake, then the mystery is in a sense greater than ever; for we are thenleft with the problem of trying to explain away a great many pieces ofremarkably convincing evidence.The known history of the shroud begins in 1353, when Geoffroy de Charny, Lord ofSavoisie and Lirey, built a church at Lirey and put on show “the true burialsheet of Christ”. This was a strip of linen, just over fourteen feet long andthree and a half feet wide. On this linen there was the dim brown image of a man– or rather, two images, one of his front and one of his back. Apparently thebody had been laid out on the bottom half of the sheet, which had then beenfolded down over the top of the head. And, in some strange way the image of theman had been imprinted on the shroud like a very poor photographic image.A “relic” like this was worth far more than its weight in gold, as pilgrimspoured into the church to see it and dropped their coins into the collectionbox. In 1389 the bishop of Troyes, Peter D’Arcis, declared the shroud to be afake, painted by an artist, and tried to seize it; but he was unsuccessful. In1532 the shroud was almost destroyed in a fire in the Sainte Chapelle atChambéry, France, and when it was recovered it had been badly damaged – manyholes had been burnt in it by molten silver. Fortunately, these completelymissed the central part which contained the image, and when the nearby nuns ofSt Clair had patched it it looked almost as good as new.As far as the modern reader is concerned, the real history of the shroud beginson 28 May 1898. The shroud had been in Turin cathedral since 1578 – it was nowthe property of the Duke of Savoy – and on 25 May 1898 it was again put onpublic display. A Turin photographer, Secondo Pia, was commissioned tophotograph it. And it was in his apartment, towards midnight, that thephotographer removed the first of two large plates from the developing fluid.What he saw almost made him drop the plate. Instead of the dim, blurred image hewas looking at a real face, quite plainly recognizable. Yet he was looking at aphotographic negative, not the final product. This could only mean one thing:that the image on the shroud was itself a photographic negative, so by“reversing” it Pia had turned it into a positive – a real photograph. If therelic was genuine, Pia was looking at a photograph of Christ.The Duke of Savoy – now King Umberto I (he would be assassinated two yearslater) – was told the news; a procession of distinguished visitors began toarrive at the photographer’s house. Most of them, understandably, were convincedthat this must be the true Holy Shroud, since no painter would have thought offorging a photographic negative. The only other possibility was that the effecthad been achieved accidentally by a forger, but this seemed unlikely. Two weekslater a journalist broke the story, and it spread round the world.But the shroud’s fame was not to last for long. Two years later a detailedreport on it by a medieval scholar, Fr. Ulysse Chevalier, defused theexcitement. Chevalier studied all the documents he could find, including PeterD’Arcis’s assertion that it was a fake (D’Arcis claimed that the artist hadconfessed), and declared firmly that the image on the shroud was a painting; hequoted a well-known photographer to the effect that the “negative” aspect of thepicture was merely a technical accident. Scholars were convinced; the HolyShroud was just another false relic, like the thousands of pieces of the “truecross” in churches all over the world.But a new defender had already appeared on the scene. Paul Vignon, a painterwith an interest in biology, had become the assistant of Professor Yves Delageof the Sorbonne. Vignon was a Catholic, Delage an agnostic. But it was Delagewho in 1900 showed Vignon photographs of the shroud, and aroused his interest inthe problem. Surely, Vignon reasoned, close examination should prove once andfor all if the shroud had been painted by hand? He went to Turin and obtainedcopies of Secondo Pia’s photographs, as well as two snapshots of the shroudtaken at the same time by other men.The first question Vignon asked himself was how the brown stains could have beenmade. If it had been painted by an artist, could he have produced such animpressive negative? It would mean painting without really seeing what he wasdoing, and as an artist, Vignon knew this was virtually impossible. And sincephotography did not exist in 1353, the artist would have had no means ofchecking his work. And why should he have wanted to produce a negative if theintention was to deceive pilgrims? They would prefer a recognizable face . . .Vignon tried coating his face in red chalk-dust, then lying down and coveringhis face with a cloth, which was then pressed gently against his face. Theresult was not a negative; it was just blotches.So if the image had been produced by “contact”, it could not have been this kindof crude, direct contact. But in that case, what kind of contact? One mysterywas that even the hollows of the face had been “imprinted”; the image showed thebridge of the nose, yet a cloth laid over someone’s face would not touch thebridge of the nose.Suppose the image had been produced by sweat? The commonest burial ointmentswere myrrh and aloes at the time of the Crucifixion. Vignon and Delage triedimpregnating a cloth with myrrh and aloes, then seeing what effect sweat had onit. Sweat contains a substance called urea, which turns into ammonia (hence thedisagreeable smell of people with BO). They found that sweat would produce brownstains on their impregnated cloth.Oddly enough, the agnostic Delage finally became convinced that the shroud wasgenuine – although he stopped short of becoming converted to Christianity. Thisman’s “photograph” showed signs of scourging, and of being pierced in one sidewith a spear; the forehead had marks that would correspond to a crown of thorns.There were nail-marks in the wrists and the feet. Most paintings of theCrucifixion show nails driven through the hands, but Vignon established that thehands would not support a man on the cross – they would tear. In fact,historical research has shown that crucifixion involved nailing the wrists, notthe hands.The report by Vignon and Delage was read on 21 April 1902 at the Academy ofSciences, and caused a sensation, Vignon and Delage were praised and denounced.Yet, oddly enough, some influential Catholics still regarded the shroud as animposture; the Jesuit Father Herbert Thurston, of London’s Farm Street,contributed a piece to the Catholic Encyclopedia in which he stated his viewthat the shroud was a mere “devotional aid”, painted by some fourtenth-centurymonk.The controversy died down; almost thirty years passed. In May 1931 it wasdecided to exhibit the shroud again in belated celebration of the marriage ofCrown Prince Umberto. More photographs were taken, by Giuseppe Enrie. They werefar better in quality than Pia’s earlier photographs, and the sense of realitywas even stronger. Moreover, close examination of the cloth showed that thepaint theory was unlikely; paint would have soaked in, and the brown stainseemed to be on the surface. Even under a microscope, no fragments of paint werevisible.The photographs were shown to an eminent French anatomist, Pierre Barbet, whoproceeded to study them in minute detail. The photograph showed that the nailthat had penetrated the wrist had emerged in the back of the hand. Could this bea forger’s mistake? Barbet tried nailing a severed wrist; when the nail struckthe bone it slipped upward, and emerged at exactly the spot shown in thephotograph. The wrists showed two streaks of blood, as if the wrist had been intwo different positions. Barbet showed that a man hanging by the wrists wouldsoon suffocate; in order to breathe he would have to force himself upright,literally standing on the nails that held his feet; but he would soon becomeexhausted, and slump again. The bloodstains corresponded precisely to the twopositions. Brooding on the apostle John’s description of the lance-thrust intothe side of the dead Christ, “and immediately there came out blood and water”,Barbet tried to experiment of thrusting a knife into the side of a corpse abovethe heart; the result was “blood and water” – a mixture of blood and pericardialfluid.All these investigations gave Barbet an appalling insight into the sufferings ofa man dying on the cross – to such an extent that he admitted he no longer daredto think about them and his book The Corporal Passion of Jesus Christ became thesubject of endless Easter sermons. Barbet was himself overcome with emotion whenhe succeeded in catching a close-up glimpse of the shroud in October 1933, andrealized that some of the brown stains were bloodstains – the blood of Christ .. . He sank to his knees and bowed his head.One thing was by now obvious: that the information contained in the shroud wasso complex that the chances of it being a fake were a thousand to one against.The study of the shroud became something of a science in its own right. It waschristened sindonology (the Italian for the shroud being sindone), and PaulVignon became its acknowledged leader. It was Vignon who made the interestingsuggestion that the shroud might be responsible for a sudden change in therepresentations of Jesus in the time of the emperor Constantine (AD 274–337); inthe first three centuries after the Crucifixion, Jesus is represented as abeardless youth, but after that as a bearded man with a moustache. Could it havebeen the discovery of the shroud that caused the change? Vignon studied hundredsof paintings, and concluded that a large number of them seemed to have beeninfluenced by the shroud. For example, there was a small square above the nose,due to an imperfection in the weave of the cloth, and he found this in many ofthe portraits of Jesus. In the so-called “holy face of Edessa” a portrait datingfrom a century after Constantine there is a distinct resemblance to the face onthe shroud.A later scholar, Ian Wilson, has argued convincingly that the shroud isidentical with a relic known as the Mandylion, the handkerchief with which StVeronica wiped the face of Jesus when he was on his way to Calvary, and on whichJesus miraculously imprinted his image. The Mandylion (or a relic claiming to bethe original handkerchief of St Veronica) was preserved in Byzantium until itwas sacked by the Crusaders in 1204; it had come there from Edessa (Urfa, inmodern Turkey) in August AD 994. Wilson argues that the shroud was folded sothat only the face was visible, and that this was the Mandylion. In his book TheTurin Shroud, Wilson devotes more than a hundred pages to studying documentarysources and attempting to trace the history of the shroud-Mandylion before itappeared in Lirey in the mid-fourteenth century. His arguments are too long todetail here, but his tentative reconstruction is as follows.After the Crucifixion (about AD 30), the shroud was folded and disguised as aportrait, to hide its “unclean” nature as a burial cloth. It was taken toEdessa, then a thriving Christian community; but when Ma’nu VI reverted topaganism in AD 57 and persecuted the Christians it was hidden in a niche in thewall above Edessa’s west gate. Although Christians were once again toleratedabout 120 years later, the shroud’s existence remained unknown. In 525 severefloods in Edessa cost 30,000 lives and destroyed many public buildings; theshroud was rediscovered when the walls were being rebuilt. (This version, ofcourse, contradicts Vignon’s hypothesis that it was rediscovered in the reign ofConstantine three centuries earlier.) In the spring of 943 the Byzantine armybesieged Edessa and offered to spare the city in exchange for the Mandylion; sothe Mandylion was transferred to Constantinople. It was discovered to be aburial shroud in about AD 1045, probably when someone unpinned the Mandylionfrom its frame to remount it. In 1204, when the Crusaders took Constantinoplefrom the Greek Christians, the shroud vanished again. What happened next isunknown, but one conjecture is that it fell into the hands of the KnightsTemplars, who were accused of worshipping a man’s head with a red beard. In1291, after the fall of Acre (where the Templars had their treasury), the clothwas brought to Sidon, then to Cyprus.In 1306 the Treasury of the Templars came to France, brought by Jacques Molay.On 13 October 1307 the Templars were arrested on the orders of King Philip theFair, who was anxious to lay his hands on their money, and in March 1314 JacquesMolay was burnt at the stake, together with Geoffrey de Charnay, the order’sNormandy master. It is not known if this Geoffrey de Charnay was related to theGeoffroy de Charny who built the Lirey church in 1353, and who seems to haveexhibited the shroud there about 1355. When Geoffroy was killed at Poitiers inSeptember 1356 the shroud became the property of his infant son, also calledGeoffroy; the shroud was exhibited (perhaps to raise money) in 1357, but BishopHenry of Poitiers ordered the exhibition (or “exposition”) to be stopped. In1389 another exposition aroused the anger of Peter D’Arcis, Bishop of Troyes,who appealed to the king, then to the pope, to gain possession of the relic; heinsisted that the shroud had been forged by an artist around 1355. The popesupported the de Charny family, and the Bishop’s attempt was a failure. In 1400,after the death of the younger Geoffroy de Charny, his daughter Margaret marriedHumbert of Villersexel, and the shroud was handed over to him for safe-keeping.It was kept in the chapel at St Hippolytesur-Doubs, and was exhibited yearly ina meadow on the banks of the Doubs (Known as the Saviour’s Meadow, Pré duSeigneur). The Lirey canons tried hard to recover it from about 1443, and evensucceeded in having Margaret excommunicated; but they failed to regain it. WhenMargaret died in 1460 the shroud already seems to have been in the possession ofthe Duke of Savoy, who gave Margaret two French castles. In 1502 the shroud wasdeposited in Chambery castle, where thirty years later it was almost destroyedin a fire. And in 1578 the shroud was taken to Turin, where it has remained eversince, except for the Second World War, when it was taken to the Abbey of MonteVergine at Avellino for safety.In 1955 Group Captain Leonard Cheshire took a crippled Scottish girl to Turin,and she was allowed to hold the shroud in her lap; however, no cure took place.Possibly this failure decided Cardinal Pellegrino of Turin to make a determinedattempt to establish the shroud’s authenticity or otherwise by scientific means.In June 1969 a scientific commission was allowed to examine the shroud, and morephotographs (some in colour) were taken by Giovanni-Battista Judica-Cordiglia.For two days the commission examined the shroud, and recommended a series oftests that would involve the “removal of minimum samples”. In Portugal exiledKing Umberto II gave his permission for the tests. On 23 November 1973 theshroud was shown for the first time on television. The next day it was removedto a small room at the rear of Turin cathedral, and a total of seventeen sampleswere carefully removed. Part of the backing-cloth sewn on by the nuns after thefire was also removed, and this revealed the interesting fact that the image onthe cloth had not “soaked through” to the other side. In fact, closerexamination of a thread showed that the brown stain was restricted to the verysurface of the cloth. This also seemed to rule out the possibility that therewas actual blood on the shroud – we may recall the fact that Pierre Barbet hadfallen on his knees when it had struck him that he was looking at a realbloodstain. In fact tests showed that there was no blood on the shroud.Another scientist, Dr Max Frei of Zurich, had noticed that there was dust on theshroud, and he took samples by pressing adhesive tape to the surface of thelinen. Back in his labouratory, a microscope revealed that there were manypollen grains among the dust and mineral particles. Frei, a criminologist, wasan expert on pollens. One of his first discoveries was of pollen from a cedar ofLebanon. That looked promising – except that such trees have spread far fromLebanon, especially in public parks. Then he came upon something more revealing:pollens from plants unique to the Jordan valley, adapted to live in a soil witha high salt content. He went on to identify forty-nine varieties of pollen, manyfrom Jerusalem, others from Istanbul (Constantinople), others from Urfa(Edessa), others from France or Italy. This constituted powerful evidence thatthe shroud had originated in the Holy Land, had travelled to Turkey, then toFrance and Italy. This was undoubtedly the most exciting discovery to emergefrom the 1973 examination.By the time of this examination, important research was also being carried on inAmerica by a physicist, John Jackson, and his friend Dr Eric Jumper, a USAFcaptain. They made a “dummy” shroud by using a transparency and marking all theshroud’s main features on a similar piece of cloth. Placing the dummy over a manwho was lying down, they then plotted the relative darkness of the brownmarkings. This revealed the curious fact that the markings were strongest wherethe cloth would have touched the body, and that they seemed to be in exactproportion to the distance the cloth would have been from the flesh – forexample, being faintest below the chin, where the cloth would have beenstretched between the chin and the chest.But it was in 1976 that the two stumbled on their most fascinating piece ofinformation – and perhaps the most exciting discovery since Secondo Pia’soriginal photograph. They decided to subject the shroud to “image-enhancement”.This is a modern technique whose purpose is to analyze the relative brightnessof areas of a photograph – for example, one taken by a space-probe – and tointensify them selectively to “bring out” underlying images. (It has been usedon photographs of the Loch Ness monster.) Since the image-enhancer can alsointerpret information about distance, it can also turn a flat photograph into athree-dimensional image, the equivalent of turning it into a statue. The“statue” can then be turned from side to side. From a small transparency of theshroud Jackson and Jumper obtained an amazingly perfect image of the face. Itproved that the brown marks on the shroud actually provided enough informationfor the computer to reconstruct the original and, in doing so virtually ruledout the possibility that the shroud was a painted forgery. In fact, as Jacksonand Jumper pointed out, the shroud was in many respects superior to a modernphotograph. A photograph may not contain enough “distance information” toproduce an accurate “statue” – so an attempt to translate a photograph of PopePius XI into a three-dimensional image flattened the nose, distorted the mouthand made the eyes too deeply set. The image on the shroud was more accurate thanthat. It even revealed something never before recognized – that coins had beenplaced on both eyes, according to the Jewish burial custom of the time. Otherresearchers, Donald Lynn and Jean Lorre, were even able tentatively to identifythe coins – as “leptons”, the “widow’s mite” of the New Testament.In 1977 Dr Walter McCrone, a Chicago microanalyst, submitted a request to takesamples from the shroud. McCrone had disproved the authenticity of the “Vinlandmap”, which was supposed to prove that Vikings discovered America, by showingthat although the parchment was medieval, the ink contained a component onlyused after 1920. McCrone stated that with the use of the ion microscope he couldidentify the nature of the shroud’s image. But in 1977 his chances of laying hishands on material from the shroud seemed minimal; Turin had demanded the returnof the small samples. Then a new Cardinal of Turin was appointed, AnastasioBallestrero, former archbishop of Bari. In August 1978 Ballestrero mountedanother exposition of the shroud, and it was clear that he was not averse tomore scientific tests. Jackson and Jumper, Lynn and Lorre, were able to takemore material; Max Frei took more dust and pollen samples. And McCrone got histest samples.For the believers, McCrone’s results were disappointing. He announced that hismicroscopic examination had revealed traces of iron oxide and of paint fragmentson the shroud, and concluded that this proved that it was a forgery. Otherscientists pointed out that flax is soaked in water before it is made intolinen, and that this could easily be the source of the minute traces of ironoxide. Moreover, the shroud has often come into contact with artists – manycopies around Europe bear an inscription certifying that they have been inactual contact with the Holy Shroud of Turin (and have thus, presumably,absorbed some of its virtue). Nothing is more likely than that it has sometraces of the pigments used to make such copies.At the time of writing these questions remain unresolved. The sceptical schoolhas returned to the old assertion, first made by Fr. Ulysse Chevalier, that theshroud is a forgery whose peculiar properties – when subjected to photographyand image-enhancement – are due somehow to the “decay” of the original pigment.This belief seems as absurd now as it seemed at the turn of the twentiethcentury. Carbon 14 dating could perhaps resolve the question once and for all,if it proved that the linen of the shroud dates from long after the Crucifixion.This had still not been carried out when this book was written, partly becausecarbon dating techniques would still involve the destruction of a small amountof the cloth of the shroud, but permission for this has apparently now beengranted.But if, as seems likely on the basis of Max Frei’s pollen results, the shroudproves to be of the right date, we are still faced with the mystery of how theimage was “imprinted” on it. American investigators have pointed out thesimilarity of the markings to “radiation burns” produced by atomic explosions,and suggested that the image may have been impressed on the shroud by a verybrief and intense burst of radiation – perhaps when the body of Jesus wasbrought back to life in the tomb. The sceptics counter this by asking why a“miracle” should involve atomic radiation. Their question seems unanswerable.But then, so does the evidence of the extraordinary amount of “information”encoded in the shroud. If the shroud proves to be a fourteenth-century forgery,the miracle will be almost as great as if it is proved genuine.Postscript to “The Holy Shroud” The developments in the Turin Shroud case since this article was written areextremely interesting.In 1977, an American organization called the Shroud of Turin Research Project(STURP) was formed. The Catholic Church continued to reject all proposals tohave the shroud subjected to carbon dating, but finally gave way, and agreed toa test on 21 April 1988. Three labouratories were involved: from Arizona, Oxfordand Zurich. The results were published on 13 October 1988, and showed withninety-nine per cent certainty that the material of the shroud dated frombetween AD 1260 and 1390.So it seemed that the shroud was a fake. Then who faked it, and why?In 1994, Lynn Picknett and her fellow researcher Clive Prince came up with arather interesting answer to this question. Their book, The Turin Shroud – InWhose Image? was subtitled “The Shocking Truth Unveiled”.According to Picknett and Prince, the “fake” was the work of Leonardo da Vinci,and he was probably commissioned to do it by the pope.But how about the fact that Leonardo was born in 1452, 99 years after the shroudhad first been put on display? Their theory is that Leonardo was commissioned bythe pope to make a copy of the shroud that would be exhibited to draw thetourists – because, we presume, the other was becoming worn.This story, apparently, was told by a Neapolitan named Giovanni Battista dellaPorta, who is usually credited with the invention of photography, since hedescribed the process in 1552, 33 years after Leonardo’s death. Then Leonardo’snotebooks were translated, (he had written them in a kind of code) and theyshowed that Leonardo had invented what he called “the artificial eye” (oculusartificalis). Leonardo explained that if the façade of a building is illuminatedby the sun, and a small hole is made in the face of the building facing it, thelight passing through this hole will throw an upside-down image of the façade ona wall. It would be about another 150 years, in the 1640s, until the Jesuitscientist Athanasius Kircher used the principle in the first “magic lantern”.What Picknett and Prince then have to prove is that silver nitrate or chloride,the chemicals that “photograph” the image, were known at the time of Leonardo.They are able to show that these had been known since the beginning of thatcentury.The theory is original, but most people will feel, rightly, that it is simplytoo speculative, without solid evidential proof. For example, if carbon datinghas shown that the linen of the shroud was woven between 1200 and 1390, thenLeonardo’s lifetime is simply a century too late. Of course, the linen he usedmay have been lying around for a century – but it seems unlikely.This objection does not apply to another recent theory about the nature of theshroud, explained in The Second Messiah (1997) by Christopher Knight and RobertLomas. These researchers argue that the image on the shroud is that of Jacquesde Molay, Grand Master of the Knights Templar.The Templars (who are also discussed in the article on Rennes-le-Chateau) were agroup of knights who were formed in the Holy Land after the fall of Jerusalemand the success of the First Crusade in AD 1099. Their purpose was to make theroads of the Holy Land safe for pilgrims, but the original band of nine knightsclearly seems inadequate for this purpose, suggesting that it was a “blind”.Lomas and Knight argue that the Templars had another purpose when they moved into the remains of Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem, which had been destroyed by theRomans when they crushed the Jewish revolt of AD 70. The Templars, they suggest,were actually searching for old scrolls or documents.The most famous scrolls of the Holy Land are, of course, the Dead Sea Scrolls,discovered in a cave by an Arab shepherd in 1947. He took them home with him,and fortunately decided against using them as fire-lighters.Lomas and Knight believe that the scrolls in the Temple came from the samesource as the Dead Sea Scrolls, but were of far greater significance. There isevidence that the Templar who took some of the scrolls back to France wasGeoffrey de St Omer, the second in command after Hugh de Payen. The scrolls weretaken to an old priest called Lambert of St Omer, who is mainly known tohistorians because of a copy of a drawing that depicts the Heavenly Jerusalem.It was made about AD 1120, and – Lomas and Knight point out – shows the basicsymbols of Freemasonry five centuries before Freemasonry is said to have beenfounded. Lomas and Knight argue convincingly that the drawing originated inSolomon’s Temple.But what were these scrolls?The Dead Sea Scrolls were the property of a Jewish sect called the Essenes, alsoknown as the Nazoreans. These were what we might describe as Jewish Puritans,strict vegetarians who rejected animal sacrifice, and therefore refused torecognize the divine inspiration of Moses.The Essenes were founded because of a fundamental split among the Jews. When theJews were dragged off into their Babylonian exile by the armies of KingNebuchadnezzar in 587 BC, they dreamed of a Messiah who would lead them tofreedom. And when they returned to Jerusalem fifty years later, and a priestnamed Zerubbabel rebuilt the Temple, Zerubbabel was regarded by many as theMessiah – although he himself preferred to avoid that responsibility.Two centuries later, Alexander the Great conquered Palestine, and it was hisgenerals, known as Seleucids, who then ruled. But when the Greek conquerors wererash enough to place a statue of Zeus on the altar of the Temple, the Jews underJudas Maccabeus, began a highly successful guerrilla campaign, and finallyrededicated the Temple to Jehovah in 164 BC. The Maccabees became kings, as wellas high priests, of Jerusalem.This caused outrage among the descendants of Zerubbabel, who regarded theMaccabees as upstarts, and around 187 BC, many withdrew to the wilderness nearthe Dead Sea, and became the Qumran community. They lived in tents, and used thecaves as store houses. They were also known as the Essenes, and were led by aman who was referred to simply as the Teacher of Righteousness. Lomas and Knightargue that the rituals of the Essenes bore many resemblances to those of theFreemasons.In the Jewish revolt of AD 66, the Essenes hid their scrolls and manuscripts inthe Dead Sea caves, and – Lomas and Knight believe – in Solomon’s Temple, whichwas reserved for the most valuable.These, Lomas and Knight argue, is what the Templars were actually seeking. Thiswas the “treasure” that they found. They went on during the course of the nexttwo centuries, to achieve an enormous amount of wealth and influence. Thedocuments they had found in the Temple were, according to Lomas and Knight, thetitle deeds that authorized them to become the founders of a new religiousorder.The most controversial part of the argument of Lomas and Knight is that theleader of the Essenes in the first century AD were Jesus, who became known asJesus Christ, and his brother James. Jesus, they claim, was actually known asJesus the Nazorean, not the Nazarene. Nazareth, they say, did not even exist inJesus’ time.According to Lomas and Knight, it was Jesus’ younger brother James, also knownas Ya’cov, who was the leader of the Essenes and the “Teacher of Righteousness”.The Roman Catholic Church has denied that Jesus had brothers or sisters,although this is actually contradicted by the Gospel of Matthew (13: 55): “Isthis not the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothersJames, Simon and Jude? And his sisters, are they not all with us”?Lomas and Knight argue that Jesus was not simply a preacher of universal love;he wanted to get rid of the Romans, and was prepared to lead a revolt to do it.A large number of the Essenes preferred Jesus’ less radical brother James.Both Jesus and his cousin John the Baptist were regarded as “messiahs”.After the death of John the Baptist, Jesus took up his ministry (which onlylasted one year) gathering followers and preaching in remote places. Then hemade what, historically speaking, was his great mistake – he rode into Jerusalemon an ass, to fulfill the prediction of the prophet Zachariah that the kingwould arrive on a donkey. Then he caused a riot in the temple and attacked themoney changers.The Romans issued a wanted poster for Jesus which still survives, describing himas short, (about 4ft 6ins), bald-headed and humpbacked. His brother James wasarrested first, then Jesus was arrested in Gethsemane.It seems highly probable that Jesus was hoping that his act of rebellion wouldcause an uprising that would bring people flocking to his banner. He hadannounced that the end of the world would occur within the lifetime of peoplewho were then listening to him. He was mistaken on both counts. Instead, he wasarrested, tried and sentenced to death. Lomas and Knight argue that Barrabas,the “thief” who was acquitted was Jesus’ brother James – Barrabas is a titlemeaning “son of the Father”. An early manuscript of Matthew gives Barrabas’surname as Jesus.So Jesus was crucified, while James returned to being the leader of the Qumrancommunity. Thirty years later he would be murdered by priests, who threw himfrom the top of the temple then stoned him to death.Jesus’ body disappeared from the rock tomb, and so began rumours that he had notdied on the cross, but had been seen alive.It was St Paul–Saul – who plays the central part in the early story ofChristianity.When Saul became a Roman citizen, he changed his name to Paul and was given thejob of stamping out the remains of the Jewish freedom movement. This was tenyears after the death of Jesus, in AD 43. And it was seventeen years later thatPaul had his experience on the road to Damascus, and was suddenly converted toChristianity. Lomas and Knight state that this would not have been the Damascusin Syria, where he would have had no authority, but probably Kumran, which wasalso referred to as Damascus. And it was probably on the way to Kumran topersecute the Essenes that Paul received his revelation. He became temporarilyblind, and when he recovered, became romantically enthralled by the doctrinethat would be later labeled Christianity. This doctrine, of Paul’s owninvention, declared that Jesus had died on the cross to redeem humankind fromthe sin of Adam, and that all who believed in Jesus would become free ofOriginal Sin.James and the other Nazoreans must have been astonished and delighted todiscover that their persecutor had suddenly become Jesus’ chief admirer. Butwhen, in due course, they learned the details of the Christianity that had beeninvented by Paul, they were enraged, and habitually referred to him as “thespouter of lies”.Now in fact, these two versions of Christianity – the militant version of James,and the “gentle Redeemer” version of Paul – might well have continued to berivals for centuries to come. But the Jewish revolt put an end to that, Jameswas murdered, and most of the rebels were slaughtered or driven into exile.Paul, who was abroad preaching to the Gentiles, survived, and so did his versionof Christianity.The immense popularity of Christianity was due to the fact that it preached theend of the world within a decade or so – say, by the end of the first century –and by the time that that came and went without any sign of Armageddon St Paul’sversion of Christianity was so well established that no one noticed.For the next two centuries, the fortunes of the Christians varied, but moreoften than not they were persecuted. Then, they suddenly achieved power. Thishappened in the year AD 312, when the emperor Constantine made Christianity theofficial religion of his empire. It is usually assumed that Constantine wasconverted when he saw the sign of a cross in the sky, before the battle of theMilvian Bridge, and the words “In this sign shall ye conquer”. But the truth isthat Constantine never became a Christian – he remained a follower of the sungod Sol Invictus. There can be little doubt that his “conversion” was entirelypolitical. It was basically an attempt to prevent the shaky Roman Empire fromfalling apart. What the Empire needed, he suddenly recognized, was not a vastarmy, but a new religion. His mother Helena, a British princess, had beenconverted to Christianity. And although the Christians were a long way frombeing a majority, there were probably a few of them in every town and village inhis empire. If he handed them power, then he had a supporter in every town andvillage. If the Roman Empire could be compared to a British public school, thenthe headmaster had decided to hand over part of his authority to the prefects,who now had good reason to want to keep order.It was true that, as soon as they gained power, these gentle, peace-lovingChristians immediately began to quarrel and murder one another. But at leastthey held the empire together.Lomas and Knight quote Pope Leo X as saying: “It has served us well, this mythof Christ”.The Roman Catholic Church had every reason for supporting this new,authoritarian version of Christianity, based on St Paul’s inspired invention,but the older version – of the Nazoreans and Messianists – had not entirely diedout. For example, Paul – in the days when he was still a persecutor ofChristians – drove a group of Messianists known as Mandaeans – who regarded Johnthe Baptist as the Messiah – to Iraq, where they still continue to flourish.Lomas and Knight believed that it was this older version of Christianity, withits roots in the Kumran community, that one day became Freemasonry. And it ishere that the story touches on the strange history of Rennes-le-Chateau. HenryLincoln has argued that the order of the Priory of Sion, which was founded atthe end of the first Crusade by Hugh de Payen and his knights, actually datesback many centuries, through the dynasty known as the Merovingians. (SeePostscript to the article on Rennes-le-Chateau.)During the twelfth century, the Crusaders lost what ground they had gained inthe Holy Land; a second crusade ended in failure, and the Muslims under theleadership of Saladin recaptured Jerusalem in 1187. During the next century,seven more crusades failed to restore power to the Christians. The fall of Acrein 1291 completed their defeat, and the Knights Templar had lost their raisond’etre.Their wealth – based on exemption from taxes – remained. But the French kingPhilip the Fair (1265–1314) was eyeing them like a cat watching a mouse. He hadreason for feeling hostile, since the Templars were dedicated to the service ofthe pope, and Philip the Fair was in conflict with Pope Boniface VIII. Philipsimply wanted an excuse to pounce on the Templars, and seize their wealth.After being ejected from the Holy Land, the Templars had moved to Cyprus, butthe island was insecure. The ideal solution would have been for the Templars toreturn to France. None of them was aware how deeply the king – who had once beenturned down for membership – detested them.Boniface VIII died; his successor, Boniface IX, soon followed him – probablypoisoned by Philip. At that point – 1305 – Philip succeeded in having his owncandidate appointed pope – Archbishop Bertrand de Gotte of Bordeaux. Bertrandand Philip disliked one another, but the prizes were too great to allow this tostand in their way. So Bertrand became Pope Clement V, and the king – now he hadthe pope in his pocket – decided to move the papal seat from Rome to Avignon,and to seized the wealth of the Templars.It was an immense undertaking, since the number of Templars was now enormous,and they were among the most influential men in France. In spite of which,sealed orders went out in mid-September, 1307, ordering a swoop on the Templarson Friday, 13 October 1307. What is so amazing is that the coup actually worked,and most of the Templars fell into the trap. The exception were the Templars ofBezu, near Rennes-le-Chateau, who were almost certainly tipped off by the popehimself – it can hardly be coincidence that the chief Templar of Bezu was calledde Gotte.Philip’s excuse for having the Templars arrested was that they were actually akind of satanist organization – they were accused of homosexuality, worshippinga demon called Baphomet, and spitting upon the cross. Most of this was almostcertainly nonsense – except that the Templars probably did not believe inorthodox Christianity. If, as Lomas and Knight believe, they were descendants ofthe Essenes and the Priory of Sion, then they would certainly have regarded StPaul as a “spouter of lies”, and Pauline Christianity as a gross distortion ofthe truth.Most of the Templars were subjected to appalling tortures, so that manyconfessed to these absurd charges. The Grand Master himself, Jacques de Molay,was among those who confessed, and so was his second-in-command, Geoffrey deCharney. But at their sentencing seven years later – on 18 March 1314 – Molaywithdrew his confession, declaring it had been forced on him by torture. Theking was so enraged at having his plans thwarted that he immediately orderedMolay and Charney to be roasted alive, over a slow fire. This happened thefollowing day, on an island in the Seine called the Ile de Palais, and it issaid that Molay, dying in horrible agony, summoned the king and the pope to meethim before the throne of God within a year. Whether this is true or not, boththe king and the pope were dead within the year.In fact, Philip’s main purpose in destroying the Templars was thwarted. Theknights of Bezu and other Templars sailed out of La Rochelle in eighteen shipson the day before the arrest of the Templars, and they vanished from history. SoPhilip’s coffers were not replenished after all.At least one of the Templar ships escaped to Scotland, and it was there that aknight named William St Clair built a chapel called Rosslyn, not far fromEdinburgh, which is full of evidence that St Clair was a Templar.The chapel of Rosslyn is certainly amazing enough. To begin with, it seems to bebuilt on the plan of Solomon’s Temple. Second, some of its decorations show cobsof sweet corn, which at that time was only found in the New World, which wouldnot be discovered for another half century – St Clair began to build Rosslyn in1440. The decorations also include aloes, another American plant. It isdifficult not to agree with Lomas and Knight that some of the eighteen missingTemplar ships sailed to America. But would they take a voyage as dangerous asthat if they had no idea of what lay across the Atlantic? The highly plausiblesuggestion made by Lomas and Knight is that the “treasure” found by the firstTemplars in Solomon’s Temple included maps which showed America. And thispresupposes that the Templars had access to some ancient maps like the “maps ofthe ancient sea kings” discussed elsewhere in this book (p 91).Now Lomas and Knight discovered a four-inch tableau hidden away at the top of apillar in Rosslyn chapel showing a headless figure holding up a piece of cloth,on which there is the face of a bearded man. The head has obviously been cut offto prevent recognition. But none of the other figures has a missing head.Moreover, the faces are highly distinctive, as if they were portraits of livingpeople. So it seems likely that the figure with the missing head may have hadthe face of William St Clair himself, or possibly of a member of the de Charneyfamily, who now owned the Holy Shroud. Lomas and Knight are convinced that thecloth being held by the figure is the Holy Shroud.They also argue strongly that the image on the Holy Shroud is Jacques de Molay,the Master of the Templars.The argument they put forward in their book The Second Messiah – the sequel toThe Hiram Key – is that it was, in fact, Jacques de Molay whose outline is stillpreserved on the Holy Shroud.Now de Molay had not been tortured in the chamber of the Inquisition, but in theParis headquarters of the Templars. The rack and suspension chains would nothave been available in the headquarters. Lomas and Knight argue that de Molaywas, in fact, tortured by being crucified, and that this was carried out bynailing him to a door in a chamber at the Paris headquarters. The inquisitorWilliam Imbert a devout Catholic, would certainly have been horrified to learnthat the Templars denied that Christ was the Son of God, and would have feltthat it was highly appropriate to torture de Molay by nailing him to a door.After Molay had confessed to whatever the inquisitors accused him of, he wastaken down and wrapped in a piece of cloth which was probably there in the ParisTemple. He was laid on his bed in this “shroud”, his body streaming withperspiration, and with blood (with a high lactic acid content) and the authorsintroduce some interesting evidence to the effect that this mixture would have“photographed” de Molay’s image on the cloth of the shroud. (In an appendix toThe Second Messiah, they introduce the evidence of Dr Alan Mills, a photographicexpert, on the chemistry of this process.)This cloth, they think, was returned to the home of Geoffrey de Charney, eitherbefore or after the two men were roasted to death. Less than forty years later,the shroud was put on display in a church at Lirey, near the home of Geoffrey deCharney’s grandson, who had the same name.Thousands of people regarded Jacques de Molay as a martyr – hence the title ofthe book The Second Messiah. Four and a half centuries later, when Louis XVI wasguillotined during the French Revolution, someone in the crowd shouted: “JacquesMolay is avenged”!Lomas and Knight’s theory of the origin of the Holy Shroud is certainly one ofthe most controversial so far. It is, of course, supported by the carbon-datingof the Shroud. And the notion that the Shroud is a fake, propounded by Picknettand Prince, seems to have been disproved by the fact that chemical tests haveshown that the Shroud was genuinely soaked with blood and perspiration.It is true that the one weak point of the theory of Lomas and Knight is thatthere is no positive evidence that Jacques de Molay was tortured by beingcrucified. But if the man on the Shroud was not de Molay, then who was he?"},{"pageContent":"23 Homer and the Fall of TroyAre They Both a Myth?Although Shakespeare is acknowledged to be England’s greatest poet, seriousdoubts have been expressed about whether he wrote any of the works attributed tohim. In the case of Homer – the first great poet of Western civilization – manyschoolars have gone even further and raised doubts as to whether he actuallyexisted. A children’s book entitled How Much Do You Know? carries the followingentry under the question: “Who Was Homer”?:> The traditional author of the Iliad and the Odyssey. No evidence exists that> such a person ever lived, though every known test has been applied to the> poems, and every possible source of information scrutinized. All the Lives of> Homer are apocryphal. The best one can say is that an authoritative text of> the two poems existed at Athens between 550 and 500 BC. According to> tradition, Homer was blind, and conventional busts and pictures show him as> sightless.> > How could a famous poet be nonexistent? One widely held opinion is that variousGreek bards (or rhapsodes) invented poems about the Trojan War and its aftermathand that these various accounts were later stitched together into the poems weknow as the Iliad and the Odyssey. We can add to this question about theexistence of Homer the question of whether the Trojan War really took place orwhether – as many scholars have suggested – it was a purely mythical event, likethe wars of the gods. However, no one who has actually read straight throughthese two poems can believe that they were written by a committee.There is one very sound reason for believing that Homer really existed. Bystudying the language of the Iliad and the Odyssey, scholars have dated thepoems to some time between 750 and 650 BC. Now this is a mere two or threecenturies before the Golden Age of Athens, the age of Plato and Aristotle andEuripides. In other words, it was closer to the age of Plato than Shakespeare isto our own period at the time of this writing. Moreover, the Greek bards learnedtheir poetry by heart and could recite many thousands of lines from memory – astheir modern descendants still can today. So there was no question of Homerbeing lost in the dim mists of antiquity, in the days before there were anyhistorical records. The memories of the bards themselves were the historicalrecords. And it is impossible to believe that they simply invented a poet namedHomer and attributed various poems to him – as unlikely as believing that SirIsaac Newton was the invention of a group of seventeenth-century scientists, whoalso wrote his Principia.What seems to emerge from the available evidence is that Homer was a blind poetwho was born some time around 750 BC in Asia Minor (now Turkey) and who spentmuch of his life in poverty, wandering from place to place, until he found ameasure of fame on the island of Chios. Many fragmentary biographies of himexist among the works of the classical writers, the longest and best of which isattributed to the historian Herodotus (known as the Father of History), who wasalso born in Asia Minor about two and a half centuries later.Herodotus’s story is as follows. Homer’s mother was a poor orphan girl namedCritheis who became pregnant out of wedlock, as a result of which she moved fromAsia Minor to a place near the river Meles in Greece (Boeotia) and gave birth toa son, whom she named Melesigenes (pronounced Mellis-igenees), after the river.He was to acquire the nickname Homer (which means “blind man”6[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2234535]) many yearslater. She then returned to Smyrna (now called Izmir) and became housekeeper toa teacher of literature and music named Phemius, who fell in love with her andmarried her. So Homer acquired a stepfather who knew all about poetry and music.The young Homer distinguished himself at school. When his stepfather died –followed shortly by his mother – he took over the school with brilliant successand became something of a celebrity among his fellow citizens. He becamefriendly with a traveler named Mentes, from the island of Leucadia (now calledLeukas) in western Greece, who persuaded Homer to accompany him on his travelsand offered to pay all Homer’s expenses. Unable to resist this offer to see theworld, Homer set off with Mentes and traveled by land to what is now calledItaly. Full of curiosity, he asked questions everywhere he went. But in thecourse of his travels, he picked up an eye infection, and by the time he reachedIthaca – just south of Leucadia – it had become so serious that Mentes left himbehind with a doctor named Mentor. It was Mentor who taught Homer about thelegends of Odysseus (whom the Romans would call Ulysses7[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2234825]) and the storyof his epic voyage home from the Trojan War. When he came to compose theOdyssey, Homer gave the name Mentor to the teacher of Ulysses’s son Telemachus,and the name has become synonymous with “teacher”. But Mentor was unable to cureHomer’s eye problems. Homer decided to try to get back home, but in Colophon, inAsia Minor, he finally became blind.Back in Smyrna, he continued to devote himself to poetry. But now he had noschool to support him, and he set out on the wanderings that would last the restof his life. In a place called Neon Teichos (New Wall) he was befriended by anarmorer named Tychias and earned his bread by reciting verse. And althoughpoverty drove the blind poet to move on, the inhabitants of Neon Teichosremembered him with affection and would point out the spot where he used torecite. In Cumae, his mother’s birthplace (from which she had fled to concealher pregnancy), he once again found such a sympathetic audience for his versesthat he decided he would like to settle there and asked the town council if theywould support him with public funds in exchange for entertainment – promisingthem that he would make their city famous. But one grumpy councillor declaredthat if they fed every Homer (“blind man”) who came to Cumae, they would soon beoverrun with vagabonds. Thereupon the council decided not to grant the poet’srequest. The name “Homer” stuck, however.Homer moved to nearby Phocoae, on the island of Chios, where a would be poetnamed Thestorides persuaded him to enter into an odd bargain. Homer would writepoetry for Thestorides, in exchange for food and lodging. But his host finallybroke his bargain and threw the blind man out. Homer continued as a homelesswanderer, singing for his supper. Sometime later, back on the mainland, he metsome merchants from Chios who told him that their local poet, Thestorides, wassinging verses that were virtually identical with Homer’s. Enraged thatThestorides was passing off his (Homer’s) verses as his own, Homer hastened backto Chios, where he met a kindly goatherd named Glaucus who put him up for thenight in his hut. Homer’s story of his travels so moved Glaucus that he went tohis master and asked him to help the poet. The master was scornful, feeling thatGlaucus had been taken in by a vagabond. But when he actually met Homer, he wasso impressed by his learning and by his poetry that he engaged him as a tutorfor his children.Now, at last, Homer’s misfortunes were over. In the town of Chios he became acelebrity, and when the truth became known about Thestorides, the imposter wasdriven from the island. Homer became highly successful, both as a poet and ateacher of youth, and he married and had two daughters. Chios became so proud ofHomer that it claimed to be his birthplace. As his reputation spread to Greece,he decided to travel there again. On the island of Samos he was recognized andplayed a part in a religious festival, then was a guest in many rich houses.After this he set sail for Athens but had only reached the island of Ios when hefell ill and died, probably of a stroke. (The legend claims that his death wasbrought on by frustration at being unable to answer a riddle propounded by thechildren of fishermen.) But as his fame spread throughout Greece, and bardsrecited his poems, Chian bards formed a school known as the children of Homer –or Homeridae – which was still flourishing when Herodotus wrote his life ofHomer.So while scholars insist on preserving caution, it seems a commonsenseassumption that a blind poet named Homer was born in Asia Minor, traveled inGreece and Italy – perhaps even as far as Spain – settled in Chios, and died onhis way to Athens. The school he founded learned his words by heart; why not theevents of his life? The dates of these events are altogether more doubtful.Herodotus thinks Homer lived some four hundred years before himself – around 900BC. A later scholar, Crates, placed him around eighty years after the Trojan War(which has generally been dated about 1180 BC but which modern scholars place asearly as 1250 – a question to which we shall return in a moment). We now knowthat to be virtually impossible; for example, a reference in the Odyssey to thePhoenicians as traders dates it later than 900 BC.But anyone who has read the two epics will have noticed basic differencesbetween them. Although a great deal longer than the Odyssey, the Iliad coversonly a small part of the Trojan War – a few weeks in its tenth year – and isfull of slaughter and violence. (The story is a simple one: The Greek hero,Achilles, quarrels with King Agamemnon about a pretty slave girl and refuses totake any part in the battle – until his closest friend, Patroclus, is killed bythe Trojan Hector; then Achilles goes out to meet Hector, chases him three timesaround the walls of Troy, and kills him.) The Odyssey is altogether softer andmore lyrical in tone, describing the adventures of Ulysses as he tries to makehis way back home from Troy to Ithaca. The Greek scholar Longinus, author of Onthe Sublime, takes the view that this difference is attributable to the factthat Homer wrote the Iliad when he was young and at the height of his powers,and the Odyssey in old age. But most modern scholars explain the difference bysuggesting that two different poets wrote the two works. The author of theIliad, they claim, was the blind poet described by Herodotus. The Odyssey waswritten by a later poet, whose identity is unknown. A widely held view is thatthe Iliad was composed about 750 BC and the Odyssey about 700.There is one very obvious difference between the two poems. In the Iliad, thegods play as prominent a part as the men; they are always interfering in thebattle, and the goddess of love, Aphrodite, even swoops down and carries offParis when he is about to be defeated by Menelaus. In the Odyssey, the godsstill interfere in the narrative, but they could be eliminated without makingmuch difference to the story of Ulysses. One example will suffice: when Ulyssesis slaying his wife’s suitors, the goddess Minerva (Athena) puts in anappearance, disguised as the estate manager; but after the suitors havethreatened her with violent reprisals, she turns herself into a swallow andflies up to the rafters. Such an event, one would expect, would clearly convincethe suitors that something supernatural was going on and would lower theirmorale; in fact, they seem not to notice and proceed to attack Ulysses as ifnothing had happened. The appearance of the goddess is not only pointless, itmakes the scene absurd. It is almost as if the Iliad belongs to an earlierperiod of belief, while the Odyssey was written by someone for whom the godswere little more than a convenient plot mechanism.But if the author of the Odyssey was not the blind Homer, then who was he?The English writer Samuel Butler became aware of the puzzle in 1891. Butler isbest known for his amusing satirical novel Erewhon, but it would be a mistake tothink of him as a satirist. He was a serious thinker who devoted an importantpart of his life’s work to attacking Darwin’s theory of evolution. He objectedto Darwin’s view that mutations cause species to change at random and thatevolution is due simply to the survival of the fittest. Butler objected thatDarwin had “banished God from the universe” and turned the universe into agigantic machine. He preferred the views of the earlier zoologist Lamarck, whobelieved that species change because they make determined efforts to change.(For a more detailed account of the problem, see chapter 35.)At the age of fifty-six Butler decided to compose a cantata entitled Ulysses.(He was also an amateur composer who wrote in the style of Handel.) Hislibrettist, Henry Festing Jones, was relying on Charles Lamb’s Adventures ofUlysses, but Butler felt he should reread the Odyssey, of which he retained onlyvague memories from his schooldays. Butler found Homer’s Greek simple andstraightforward and decided to make his own prose translation. As he worked, hebecame aware of a feeling of unease, of “a riddle that I could not read”. TheIliad is full of larger-than-life heroes. The Odyssey, by comparison, struckButler as far more lifelike, in fact, as a kind of novel rather than an epic,full of real people and real observations. The latter begins by telling howUlysses’s son Telemachus, sick of the horde of suitors who surround his mother,Penelope, goes off to see if he can find news of his father; he calls on KingMenelaus, who is now living happily with his errant wife, Helen of Troy, and thedomestic scene has an almost tongue-in-cheek atmosphere. Here he learns that hisfather is a prisoner of the nymph Calypso.The scene shifts to Calypso’s island, where Ulysses has been allowed to leave(owing to the intervention of Jupiter). But the god Neptune, who dislikedUlysses, caused a storm, which wrecked the hero on the coast of a country calledScheria. Here he was found lying asleep by Nausicaa, the king’s daughter, whotook him back to the palace. And here, in due course, Ulysses tells the story ofwhat happened to him after he left Troy (which was captured by means of a woodenhorse). At this point, we have a long story-within-a-story, which forms the mainpart of the Odyssey.Butler was struck by the realism of the Nausicaa episode and its many homelytouches. It confirmed his feeling that the Odyssey was a kind of novel, based onreal people. A few books later, after Ulysses has encountered the Cyclops, thegod of wind (Aeolus), and the man-eating Laestrigonians, he lands on the islandof the enchantress Circe, who changes his men into swine. And it was as he wasreading about Circe that Butler was suddenly struck by a dazzling intuition:that Circe was not created by a man but by a woman – and, moreover, by a youngone. Closer reading convinced him of this. The males of the Odyssey are woodencreatures compared to the women, who have that touch of life. Butler alsoconcluded that while the author of the Odyssey shows intimate knowledge of theaffairs of women, he is often oddly uncomfortable when describing things thatare the province of males, especially seamen or farmers. What male would placethe rudder in front of the ship? What seaman would believe that seasoned timbercan be cut from a growing tree? Or make the wind “whistle” over the waters? (Itwhistles on land, because of obstacles, but there are no obstacles at sea.) Whatman with any knowledge of farming would make a herdsman milk the sheep, thengive them their lambs to feed (presumably with empty udders)? What countrymanwould make a hawk tear its prey on the wing? The author of the Odyssey makesthese curious errors, and many more. Butler goes on to argue with great skilland conviction that the author of the Odyssey had to be a woman, and a young oneat that.Now if, for the sake of argument, we are willing to admit the possibility thatthe Odyssey was written by a young woman, a kind of Greek Jane Austen orElizabeth Barrett Browning, then certain things become obvious. The first isthat she had a great deal of leisure. In Jane Austen’s day the daughter of acountry vicar would have had sufficient leisure to write novels; but in ancientGreece, life was far harder. (What moderns find so hard to grasp is that life inancient Greece was a poverty-stricken affair, with most people living on a dietof olive oil and vegetables, with some boiled mutton every week or so.) For awoman to have had leisure enough to write, she would have had to have been amember of the aristocracy, one who had servants to look after her. (And we notethat even Princess Nausicaa goes to the beach to do her own washing.)Second, a Greek Jane Austen, like the English one, would have had a fairlyrestricted knowledge of life (in those days, girls stayed at home), and youwould expect her to use her own background in her poem. Butler felt that all theolder women in the poem – Helen, Penelope, Queen Arete (Nausicaa’s mother) – arebasically the same person and that the same applies to the younger women –Nausicaa, Circe, and Calypso – and to the men – Ulysses, Nestor, Menelaus, andKing Alcinous (Nausicaa’s father). And if, like any young lady novelist, theauthoress of the Odyssey put a portrait of herself into her book, then we haveto choose between Nausicaa, Circe, and Calypso. Nausicaa is the obvious choice.And presumably, Queen Arete and King Alcinous are portraits of the authoress’sparents.But if the young authoress knew only her own home, then how did she manage todescribe the travels of Ulysses so convincingly? Presumably, by using places sheactually knew and transforming them into the lands of Polyphemus, Circe, theLaestrigonians, and so on. In other words, if one could find out where“Nausicaa” lived, one might recognize various features of the poem in itsgeography.Now Nausicaa, as we have said, lived in a land called Scheria – which means“jut-land” – a peninsula jutting into the sea, which, according to Homer, wasthe land of a people called the Phaecians. When the naked Ulysses approaches heron the beach – covering himself with a bough for decency – she gives him foodand clothing and instructs him precisely how to get back to her father’s house:“You will find the town lying between two harbors, approached by a narrow neckof land”. Later in the Odyssey, after the Phaecians have taken Ulysses back tohis own land of Ithaca, the angry sea-god, Neptune, turns their ship into a rockin the mouth of the harbor. So Butler felt he had a number of clues aboutScheria: it had to have a neck of land jutting into the sea between two harborsand a large rock that resembled a ship in the mouth of one of the harbors. Italso seems clear from the Odyssey that Ulysses approaches Scheria from the east,so that the harbor must be on the western coast. Butler went to the BritishMuseum and studied a map of Greece and Italy, looking for any west coast thathad two harbors on either side of a promontory. He could find only one – thesite of the town of Trapani, on the west coast of Sicily. Butler looked atTrapani more closely and became convinced that this had to be the home ofNausicaa. It was the only western coast in the whole area – including Italy andGreece – that fit the description. There was also a mountain – Mount Eryx –above Trapani, and Neptune is also reported in the Odyssey as threatening tobury the city of the Phaecians under a high mountain.Two earlier Greek history scholars, Stolberg and Mure, had also been convincedthat Mount Eryx fit the geography of the Cyclops episode. And the Greekhistorian Thucydides, writing around 403 BC, had mentioned that Sicily wasprobably the home of the Cyclops and the Laestrigonians. In the Odyssey, ofcourse, these episodes take place far from the home of Nausicaa. But what wouldbe more natural than for a young authoress writing a kind of novel about Ulyssesto use local scenery as its background?The next step was to visit Trapani; this Butler did in 1892. Now he had thesatisfaction of finding that everything confirmed his views. Admittedly, one ofthe two harbors was now silted up and contained a saltworks; but it was obviousthat it had once been just such a harbor as “Homer” had described. A few milesaway, on the lower slopes of Mount Eryx, was a cave that the locals still calledthe “grotto of Polyphemus”. Near the entrance to the northern harbor was a rockthat looked not unlike a ship. Local legend said it was a Turkish pirate shipturned to stone by the Blessed Virgin – obviously a Christianized form of theancient legend.Now Butler no longer had any doubt that he was on the right track. He noted thatthe description of Ithaca in the Odyssey is quite unlike the real Ithaca: it isdescribed as “highest up in the sea” with a clear view to the west, whereas thereal Ithaca is completely masked by the much bigger island of Samos (nowCephalonia) to the west. But if the authoress of the Odyssey modeled her Ithacaon the little island of Marettimo, facing the harbors of Trapani, it wouldcorrespond to the description in the Odyssey.A voyage around Sicily convinced Butler that his authoress had simply taken theisland she knew and used its scenery as the geographical background for thevoyage of Ulysses. Ulysses himself describes how he sailed down to the island ofCythera, just south of Greece, and then was prevented from turning northward(for Ithaca) by strong winds that drove him west to the land of thelotus-eaters, which must have been on the coast of north Africa. But after this,according to Butler, he made for Sicily, to the north, hunted goats on theisland of Favagnana (known to the ancients as Goat Island – Aegusa), then landedon Sicily and had his adventure with the one-eyed giant, Polyphemus, whose eyehe burned out with a stake. Then he sailed north to the island of Aeolus, thegod of winds, which Butler identifies as the little island of Ustica. The townof Cafalu, on the north coast, he thinks is the site of the adventure of theman-eating Laestrigonians. The site of Scylla and Charybdis is off the eastcoast, near present-day Messina. Finally, on his way back, he encounteredCalypso’s island, which Butler identifies as the island of Pantelleria. And soback to Trapani – or rather, to Marettimo, which is Homer’s Ithaca.If Butler had lived a century later, he would have taken a good photographerwith him to Sicily and published a series of colour photographs of the varioussites of the adventures of Ulysses in a coffee-table book, together with Homer’sdescriptions. In fact, in his book The Authoress of the Odyssey (finallypublished in 1897), Butler includes half a dozen or so photographs, but none areas convincing as they might be. Probably the best way for a modern reader tomake up his own mind would be to go to Sicily with a copy of Butler’s book. Ithas to be admitted that Butler’s own sheer excitement and enthusiasm convey agreat deal of conviction. But the section of the book that describes the variousplaces is less thorough than it could be. My own suspicion is that Butler wasdisheartened by the general skepticism he encountered and by the total lack ofresponse from the various scholars to whom he sent pamphlets about his theory.The famous Professor Jowett, an Oxford scholar and translator of Plato, admittedfrankly that he had not even glanced at the two pamphlets Butler sent him. Adozen publishers turned down Butler’s excellent prose translation of theOdyssey. So on the whole, it is not surprising that he failed to summon thenecessary energy to argue the topographical part of the book as thoroughly asthe rest.The achievement is nevertheless considerable. At the time Butler was writing hisbook, most scholars took it for granted that Homer was the author of both theIliad and the Odyssey. Nowadays, very few take that position. Butler wasadmittedly wrong about the dates – he thought that at least a hundred yearsseparated the two epics and that the Odyssey was composed around 1050 BC Butthen, Butler lacked the tools – and the archaeological information – that haveenabled later scholars to be far more precise. As to his essential thesis – thatthe Odyssey was written by a woman – few people who follow his arguments withthe Odyssey in the other hand will fail to admit that he could be right. GeorgeBernard Shaw attended a Fabian Society meeting at which Butler lectured on thefemale authorship of the Odyssey and admitted that, while initially skepticalabout the idea, he took up the Odyssey and soon found himself saying, “Of courseit was written by a woman”.Robert Graves was another classical scholar who allowed himself to be convinced,and whose novel Homer’s Daughter is inspired by the theory. The story is told byPrincess Nausicaa, who describes how her brother disappeared after a quarrelwith his wife and was assumed to have gone off to foreign parts. In fact, he hasbeen murdered by a treacherous friend. Her father, King Alpheides, sails off tolook for him, leaving Uncle Mentor in charge. Nausicaa’s suitors then behaveexactly like Penelope’s suitors in the Odyssey and move into the palace. Butwhen Nausicaa and her attendants are doing the laundry near the sea, they areapproached by a naked man who has been shipwrecked; he is a Cretan noblemannamed Aethon, and it is he who eventually slays the suitors and marriesNausicaa. Nausicaa then goes on to write the Odyssey, in which biography andlegend freely intermingle. The merit of the book is that it enables us to graspthe sheer plausibility of Butler’s theory. Homer’s Daughter is one of Graves’smost underrated books – a careful re-creation of Sicily around 800 BC thatdeserves to be as widely read as I, Claudius.Another interesting footnote to the Butler theory is that James Joyce used hisprose translation of the Odyssey as the basis of Ulysses.To summarize this part of the argument: it is probably fair to say that if theOdyssey was indeed the work of one single person – and was not the collectivework of many bards – then the contention that it was written by a woman ishighly plausible.But what of our second question: did the siege of Troy really take place, or wasit simply a myth? After all, it is obvious that the Odyssey, with its one-eyedgiants, wandering rocks, and enchantresses who turn men into pigs, is basicallya fairy tale. And the action of the Iliad is even more mythical, with the godsplaying as important a part in the action as the heroes.Let us review the story again. According to Greek legend, mostly based on theworks of Homer, a prince named Paris (or Alexandros), son of King Priam of Troy,was a guest of King Menelaus of Sparta when he fell in love with Menelaus’swife, Helen, who was a famous beauty. She was the daughter of the god Jove (orZeus) and a princess named Leda, whom Jove seduced by turning himself into aswan. Many princes had sought her hand before she accepted Menelaus. So whenParis carried her off – with or without her consent – the indignant Menelauswent to ask for help from his brother, King Agamemnon, in Mycenae (he would havehad to travel by sea, for roads were almost nonexistent), and an armada ofninety ships sailed for Troy. These included contingents led by many of Helen’srejected suitors.Troy – or Ilion – was a town whose wealth was founded on trade (like Mycenae,which was so rich that it was known as “golden Mycenae”). Its main industryseems to have been horse breeding. It is important for us to realize that inthose days, the Mediterranean was swarming with pirates, so that no town couldafford to be on the sea unless it had mighty defenses. Troy was a mile inland,but it had mighty defenses anyway, including immense walls with defensivetowers. It is also important to realize that in the ancient world, peace was arare commodity. The first thing man seems to have done when he began to live insettlements was to wage war on his neighbours, so that in the ancient world, thewords “peaceable nation” were virtually a contradiction in terms. It was notuntil relatively modern times – about 1700 or so – that the rules of historychanged and it became such a costly and highly destructive business to go to warthat long periods of peace became the norm.8[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2235078]So the Greeks attacking Troy found themselves in the position of a hawk tryingto attack a tortoise. This was no ordinary siege – no town could hold out forten years, as Troy did, if it was surrounded. The plain of Troy was notoriouslywindy – it still is – so the Greeks camped in a sheltered spot between twoheadlands and built a rampart to protect themselves. The Trojans had allies inother parts of Asia Minor, who sallied out to help them periodically. So it wasless a siege than a spasmodic series of engagements.But in the tenth year of the war something happened, and Troy fell and wasdestroyed; all its men were massacred, and its women and children were carriedoff into slavery. According to Ulysses in the Odyssey, it was he who suggestedthe stratagem of building a wooden horse and filling it with armed men, thenpretending to sail away. But of course, this could well have been an inventionof the author (or authoress) of the Odyssey.The story of the search for Troy is one of the most fascinating in the historyof archaeology, and its conclusions are more satisfyingly positive than those inthe case of the search for Homer’s identity.One story concerning the search for Troy begins in 1829, when a seven-year-oldboy named Heinrich Schliemann received a copy of Jerrer’s Universal History forChristmas. When he saw the picture of Troy in flames, he was struck by thethought that nothing could possibly destroy such mighty walls. The youngSchliemann resolved that he would one day go and investigate the matter forhimself. His father was a country parson in Neu-Buckow, Germany, who wasdismissed after being falsely accused of misappropriating church funds. Heinrichhad to become a grocer’s assistant at the age of fourteen. Tuberculosis led himto give up his job and embark for South America as a cabin boy. After ashipwreck he drifted to Amsterdam, where he became a clerk and learned English.At the age of thirty-two he learned that his brother had died in California andsailed for America to claim his estate. It was a good time to go; the gold rushmade him rich, and in 1863 he was finally able to realize his ambition to searchfor Troy. Together with a sixteen-year-old Greek schoolgirl, whom he married, hesailed for the northern coast of Turkey to begin his search.Most scholars accepted the notion that the remains of Troy would be found on amountain near Bunarbashi, about three hours from the sea. Schliemann, using theIliad as a guide, disagreed – Homer’s heroes rode between Troy and the coastseveral times a day. Schliemann concluded that a more likely site was a moundcalled Hissarlik in present-day Turkey, about an hour from the sea. (And inancient times, the sea came much farther inland.)It was an inspired guess, typical of Schliemann’s incredible luck. When he hadobtained permission to dig there, Schliemann began excavations – in 1871 – witha large gang of workmen. They soon encountered the remains of a town, but itdated from the Roman period, and it was a mere hundred yards in diameter. Belowthis was another ruined town. And then another. And then another. Eager to findHomer’s Troy, Schliemann ordered his men to slice a great trench through themiddle of the mound and keep going until they reached bedrock. All told, thereproved to be the ruins of nine cities, one on top of the other.Twelve years later, Schliemann announced that he had found the treasures of KingPriam – treasures that, for some odd reason, he had always been convinced wouldstill be there. (He never explained why the conquerors had not simply stolenthem when they destroyed Troy and massacred its inhabitants.) In hisautobiography he tells a remarkable story of how he had glimpsed a copper vesselthrough a hole in the wall and waited until his workmen had gone to lunch – hewas afraid they might be tempted to steal – before he and his wife removed atreasure of drinking vessels and jewelry. The finds were to make him worldfamous.There is, in fact, a disappointing postscript to this story. When, in 1972,Professor William Calder, of the University of Colorado, decided to startchecking on Schliemann’s biographical information, he soon discovered that thegreat archaeologist was a mythomaniac of the first order. His story about beingreceived by the president of the United States on his first visit to America waspure invention; so was his tale of being present in San Francisco on the nightof the great fire in May 1851. It became clear that his fortune was founded oncheating the bankers to whom he sold gold dust and that the story of the findingof the Trojan treasure was also an invention – it had actually been found over aconsiderable period and concealed from the eyes of his partners in theenterprise, a Turkish pasha and an American named Frank Calvert. Calder’sresearch proved that Schliemann was a crook. Yet there can be no doubt that, inspite of this, he was an inspired archaeologist.In fact, Schliemann’s next major venture was to excavate Mycenae, in southernGreece, the home of Agamemnon, the Bronze Age king who led the expedition toTroy; here he uncovered still more treasure and revealed again that, wherearchaeology was concerned, his intuition was awesome. A dig at Tiryns, the homeof King Diomedes (another Homeric hero), in 1884 uncovered some of the finestremains of Bronze Age civilization to date.In 1889 Schliemann returned to Hissarlik and renewed his search for evidence ofHomer’s Troy. What he found, in 1890, was at once exciting and depressing.Outside the mound, and well beyond the limits of what he had believed to beHomer’s Troy, he came upon the remains of a large building that in turncontained the remains of pottery that was unmistakably Mycenaean. The conclusionwas obvious: he had sliced straight through the Troy he was looking for. In thefollowing year, Schliemann died of a stroke, collapsing in the street; his deathfrustrated his plans for still more ambitious excavations.Schliemann had indeed proved that Troy existed – ancient records make it clearthat there was simply no other great city in the area. But of the nine citiesthat had been uncovered, which one was it? Schliemann had been convinced that itwas the second from the bottom – because it showed signs of having beendestroyed by fire – and in order to reach it, he had ordered his workmen toslice a huge trench through the seven layers of ruins that lay above. He was tolearn too late that his Troy was a thousand years too old and that his brutalmethods had destroyed a large part of the city he was looking for. But again,which of the other eight was Homer’s Troy?Schliemann’s collabourator, Wilhelm Dörpfeld, continued and completedSchliemann’s work. The discovery of the large building containing Mycenaeanpottery – probably a royal hall – had furnished him with the clue he needed. Itindicated that the walls of Homer’s Troy extended well beyond the boundaries ofthe mound of Hissarlik. And when Dörpfeld excavated at the southern edge of themound, he soon uncovered walls greater than any Schliemann had found. This – thesixth city from the bottom – was the city they had all been looking for. Thesewalls had a slight inward slope, just as Homer had indicated in the Iliad(Patroclus had made a determined attempt to scale them), and there was a mightytower that must have been about sixty feet high before it had been reduced bymore than half. There was a gate in the east wall and the remains of anothertower, built of limestone blocks. Inside the walls he uncovered the ruins offive large houses and deduced that the citadel had risen in concentric circles.And although “Troy 6” measured only two hundred yards by a hundred and fiftyyards, it must have been as impressive as a medieval castle. It was obvious nowwhy the Greeks had failed to take it by storm. It must have towered over theplain of Scamander as Mont Saint Michael still towers over the flat Britannymarshes.The next great step forward in Mediterranean archaeology was taken by theEnglishman Arthur Evans, who began to excavate near the city of Heraklion, onthe island of Crete, in 1900 and uncovered the remarkable royal palace atKnossos. He announced this as the palace of the legendary King Minos. Accordingto Greek legend, the king’s wife, Pasiphae, had a taste for bestiality andbecame pregnant by a bull, giving birth to a monster called the Minotaur, whichwas half man and half bull. The legend also tells how Minos demanded a yearlytribute of seven youths and seven maidens from Athens and how these were thrownto the Minotaur, which was kept in a specially built labyrinth. The Greek heroTheseus went to Crete as part of the yearly tribute, killed the Minotaur, andescaped from the labyrinth with the help of a thread, given to him by Minos’sdaughter Ariadne. Evans’s excavations revealed pictures of youths and maidensturning somersaults over the back of a bull, suggesting that there had been abull cult at Knossos. And the mazelike palace was full of symbols of adouble-headed axe, known as labrys. It began to look as if the legend of Theseusand the Minotaur was based on fact after all. If so, the same could apply to thestory of the Trojan War.One of Evans’s most important discoveries at Knossos was a quantity of claytablets written in a form of hieroglyphics – actually, two forms, which becameknown as Linear A and Linear B. Evans was convinced that they were written inthe unknown language of the ancient Cretans, which would mean that the Minoancivilization of Crete was not Greek. However, Linear B was deciphered by thescholar Michael Ventris in 1952, eleven years after Evans’s death, and proved tobe an early form of Greek. (Linear A remains undeciphered.) And names found inthe Linear B tablets included many place-names that had been mentioned in Homer.Evans’s view dominated British archaeology for many years. An American namedCarl Blegen disagreed. His excavations on mainland Greece in the 1920s convincedhim that the Greeks had dominated Mediterranean civilization for a very longtime indeed – as far back as 1900 BC. In 1932 he began a new series ofexcavations at Hissarlik, whose aim was to use the latest dating techniques(which relied heavily on pottery) to try to establish the age of all the levelsand to learn as much as possible about each.Blegen was able to establish that the bottom layer dated back as far as thefourth millennium BC (Modern dating is 3600.) But when he came to study thesixth Troy, which Dörpfeld had believed to be Homer’s, he reached a conclusionthat seemed to contradict Dörpfeld: that it had been destroyed by an earthquake.The walls had crumbled, and in one place the foundations had even shifted. Thatseemed to rule it out as the Troy burned down by Agamemnon. And Dörpfeld, whovisited the site in 1935, had to agree. Blegen dated Troy 6 about 1260 BC,possibly ten years earlier.But at the next layer, which he called 7a (because he found many subordinatelayers in the course of his digging – a total of no less than fifty), he foundsomething that looked much more promising. The streets of 7a were a kind ofshantytown, where there had formerly been houses of the nobility, now there werecramped “bungalows”. It looked as if all the people who normally lived outsideTroy had been crowded into its confines – which is what you would expect in asiege. Inside the gate was a building that Blegen called the “snack bar” – acombination of bakery and wine shop. (Blegen imagined the Homeric heroes rushingin there after battle to refresh themselves.) Moreover, this Troy had beenburned. He found smashed skulls, charred skeletons, and an arrowhead. It wasthis that led Blegen to announce triumphantly, “The sack of Troy is a historicalfact”.There was one obvious objection to this shantytown being Homer’s Troy: if thewalls had been badly damaged by earthquake at some earlier stage, then surelythe Greeks would have had no trouble in conquering the unprotected citadel? Butcloser examination disposed of this objection. Although the walls had beendamaged, the circuit still remained complete; they would still have been aformidable obstacle. Many scholars were convinced that Blegen had found the Troyof the Iliad.But other objections began to appear. There was evidence of burning in Troy 6 –Dörpfeld had noted it at the turn of the century. What is more, the “bungalows”and the “snack bar” had been built on the sites of the noble houses. But theIliad is full of noblemen and women. Surely, the obvious scenario is that Troy 6– “earthquake Troy” – was the Troy besieged by the Greeks, and that when itfell, its noblemen were slaughtered; that is why their houses gave way to lesserstructures.It is possible, however, that an earthquake caused the downfall of Homer’s Troy.It has even been suggested that the story of the wooden horse may be a “folkmemory” of this event. The sea-god Neptune (Poseidon) was often worshiped in theform of a horse and was supposed to be the master of horses. He was also the godof earthquakes. Suppose a great earthquake occurred in the tenth year of thewar, which shook the walls and destroyed some of the noble houses in thecitadel. And suppose the Greeks seized this opportunity to scale the walls –perhaps even using a siege engine that looked not unlike a horse?What we do know is that the palaces of these Greek heroes – Agamemnon and Nestorand Diomedes – were themselves destroyed half a century later (about 1200 BC),probably by mysterious raiders known as the “sea peoples”. So the mighty Achaeancivilization was brought to its knees not long after it had destroyed Troy.Writing still did not exist, except on clay tablets (and they were used only formaking lists or writing letters, not for preserving poetry); but the stories ofTroy and its heroes lived on in the memories of the bards. Centuries passed; theMediterranean was plunged into a dark age. Finally, writing in its modern form –with paper and ink – was invented and at last the great epics were written down.Apart from the Iliad and the Odyssey, there were other epic poems – the Thebais,about the siege of Thebes and the Cypria, about how Paris stole Helen – andcomic epics like the Margites (whose hero is a fool) and the unpronounceableBatrachomyomachia, or Battle of the Frogs and Mice. All these are attributed toHomer. Yet since scholars are inclined to date writing in Greece as late as 650BC, this means that Homer may have been alive six centuries after the fall ofTroy.So far, we have been obliged to admit that there is not the slightest scrap ofreal evidence for the siege of Troy, as described by Homer. Schliemann claimedto have found the jewels of Helen and the mask of Agamemnon, and Blegen claimedto have found the palace of King Nestor at Pylos. This may all have been wishfulthinking – in fact, it undoubtedly was in the case of Schliemann. Butconfirmation of the Trojan War and its heroes was to come from a completelyunexpected source.In 1834 a young Frenchman named Charles Texier was riding through central Turkeywhen he heard of some ruins near the village of Bogazköy. They proved to be thegigantic remains of an earlier civilization, with tremendous walls andmagnificent ruined buildings ornamented with winged demons and unknownhieroglyphs. It took half a century before it was recognized that these were theremains of a mighty empire that had once extended from Asia Minor down to Syria– the empire of the people known as the Hittites, who had once attacked Babylon.Their empire, like that of the Greeks, collapsed about 1200 BC; but twocenturies earlier it had been one of the greatest nations of the Middle East.The period of the fall of Troy had been the period of the slow disintegration ofthe Hittite empire. Moreover, most of Asia Minor had been a part of that empire.So Troy was, in a sense, a Hittite town.The ruins discovered by Texier were those of the Hittite capital, Hattusas, andin excavations undertaken between 1906 and 1908, the archaeologist Hugo Winklerfound a mighty library of clay tablets, some in Hittite and some in Akkadian,the language in which diplomacy was conducted. Deciphered during the First WorldWar, the tablets, from the Hittite equivalent of the foreign office, gave adetailed impression of the working of Hittite foreign policy.These documents provided some fascinating glimpses into Near Eastern history.They revealed, for example, that after the death (around 1360 BC) of theEgyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen (he died of a blow to the head at the age ofeighteen), his widow, Enhosnamon, wrote to the emperor of the Hittites,Suppiluliumas, requesting a husband. An ambassador was sent to Egypt and wasthere shown tablets containing details of an old treaty between Egypt and thekingdom of Hatti (the land of the Hittites); this convinced him of their goodfaith, and a prince named Zannanza was sent to Egypt. However, the high priestAy wanted to marry the widow, and Zannanza was murdered – which caused adiplomatic crisis. All this was told in a document by the son of Suppiluliumas,King Mursilis II.Was there anything about Troy or the Mycenaean civilization in these amazingrecords? In 1924 the Swiss historian Emile Forrer announced that he had foundreferences to a country named Ahhiyawa, somewhere to the west, and he identifiedthis as meaning “Achaia-land” – Homer always referred to the Greeks as Achaeans,or Achaiwoi. And although a philologist named Ferdinand Sommer criticizedForrer’s findings in a 1932 book entitled The Ahhiyawa Documents, Forrer’s caseremains remarkably convincing.Moreover, in 1963 an archaeological dig at Thebes (northwest of Athens) revealedmore Hittite documents dating from the right period. Oddly enough, some of thesewere from the Hittite “foreign office” to the king of Ugarit, the great tradingcentre in northern Syria. There were also seals from Babylon, which research hasshown to have been plundered from the temple of Marduk, sacked by the Assyriansaround 1225 BC. It seems that the Assyrians, who were gaining power in the areaand were therefore enemies of the Hittites, regarded the Greeks as allies. So itappears certain that the Hittites were aware of the Greeks (a fact that has beendenied by some of Forrer’s critics). In some Linear B tablets, Greece is calledAchaiwia, which sounds very like the Hittite Ahhiyawa.What also emerges from the Hittite records is that the Ahhiyawans controlledsome territory of the coast of Asia Minor, including a city called Millawanda orMilawata. Now on the coast of Asia Minor, some two hundred miles south of Troy,there was a Greek-controlled city called Miletus, earlier known as Milatos.Geographical accounts make it clear that Miletus is Milawata. And since theHittite records refer to the land of the Ahhiyawa as “overseas” from Miletus,this seems to suggest that it is “Achaiwia” or Achaea – that is, mainlandGreece. Relations between the Miletan Greeks and the Hittites were basicallyfriendly, although Miletus was sacked by the Hittites in 1315 BC in the courseof a quarrel.The records also show that a Greek king was in dispute with the Hittites around1260 BC over a northern city called Wilusa. We know that the early Greeks calledIlios (Troy) “Wilios”. And 1260 was, of course, the approximate date of theGreek expedition against the Trojans. At about this date the Hittite kingHattusilis mentions in a letter his troubles with the Greeks as well as the sackof the city of Carchemish – far to the east – by his new enemy, the Assyrians.Some ten years later the Hittite emperor wrote to the king of the Greeks, whomhe addressed as brother. It seems that this king’s brother had been causingtrouble for the Hittites. What seems to have been happening was this: thebrother of the Greek king, a man named Tawagala, had joined with a rebel fromArzawa – a region northeast of Miletus – in harassing the Hittite garrison. Theemperor of the Hittites marched with an army to Miletus, found that his enemieshad fled, and wrote an aggrieved letter to the Greek “king” that made it clearthat the Greeks were then a major power in the Mediterranean. The king to whomthe Hittite emperor was writing could well have been Agamemnon. His rebelliousbrother Tawagala has been identified as a Greek named Eteocles, and if we knewthat Agamemnon had a brother of that name, it would clinch that argument.Unfortunately, we only know of his other brother, Menelaus.In the television series, “In Search of the Trojan War”, the historian MichaelWood argues strongly that Wilusa was Troy (not just the city, but the whole areaaround it), using a great deal of geographical evidence from the Hittiterecords. Moreover, the king of Wilusa is called Alaxandus. Homer often refers toParis – who abducted Helen – as Alexandras of Troia. Wood cites other Hittiterecords that show the king of the Greeks was in Asia Minor in the reign ofHattusilis III (1265–35 BC – which would include the date of the Trojan War). Ifthat king was Agamemnon – as seems likely from the dates – then we have powerfulevidence for Homer’s story.There is another piece of evidence for the existence of the Trojan War,unearthed by Blegen in his excavations at Pylos, the home of Homer’s KingNestor. Among the Linear B tablets found at Pylos were many referring to a largenumber of “Asian” women who were apparently slaves, and whose main tasks weregrinding corn and preparing flax. Asia is short for Asia Minor and actuallyrefers to the kingdom of Lydia, south of Troy. But references to the places fromwhich these captives were taken make it clear that they came from many places onthe coast of Asia Minor, including Chios and Miletus. We know, of course, thatthe Greeks were pirates, so these women may have been captured on raids. But thesheer number – seven hundred women, four hundred girls, and three hundred boys –suggests that they were captives of war. Some of these women are referred to asTo-ro-ja, which sounds like “people from Troy”. Again, the date is right – theperiod of the Trojan War. No men are mentioned – and Homer tells us that the menof Troy were killed, and their women and children enslaved and taken back toGreece.So what seems to emerge from the historical record is this: The period of theTrojan War was, in fact, a period of many wars in Asia Minor. The empire of theHittites was weakening, and the Greeks took advantage of this to raid “Asian”settlements and to encourage rebellion. Troy (or Wilios) had always been afaithful ally of the Hittites, and records show that the Trojan princeAlaksandus had fought on the side of the Assyrian king Muwatallis (1296–1272BC), the elder brother of Hattusilis. Another independent tradition fromsouthwest Asia Minor declares that the lover of Helen is an ally of Muwatallis.So if this Alaksandus is indeed Prince Alexandros – Homer’s Paris – then he wasnot a young man when he seduced Helen but a grizzled veteran.Some ten years after fighting on the side of Muwatallis at the battle of Kadesh(in Syria) in 1274 BC, Alexandros went to call on Menelaus, brother ofAgamemnon, in Sparta. We may surmise that Menelaus was not a particularly strongcharacter – legend represents him as unlucky in love and war – and that Helenfound the battle-scarred veteran Paris much more attractive, and eloped withhim.When Menelaus went to his brother, the mighty “King of the Achaeans”, tocomplain, Agamemnon may or may not have been indignant at the abduction of hissister-in-law. But he knew perfectly well that the west coast of Anatolia(“Asia”) was highly vulnerable since the Hittites had been forced to go to warwith various neighbours, including the Assyrians. It was just the kind ofopportunity for plunder that the piratical Greeks loved. So off they sailed witha vast fleet. Achilles, we learn from Homer, landed by mistake in Mysia, southof Troy, but was driven back to his ships by Telephus, the king of Mysia –though not before ravaging the country.The Greeks attacked Troy, and the Hittites were too weak to send aid. But Troywas virtually impregnable, and it was not until the tenth year of the war thatan earthquake caused a certain amount of chaos and finally permitted the Greeksto take the city. The men were killed, and the women and children were takenback to Greece as slaves. Troy itself was burned and its noble houses destroyed.In its place there sprang up a city of “bungalows”. The Greeks continued to makenuisances of themselves with impunity, aiding rebels against the Hittites – whohad to do their best to make peace with them – and carrying off more captivesfrom other cities of “Asia”.What happened during the next half century is still not clear to historians. Allwe know is that raiders who are known only as the “sea peoples” wreaked havocthroughout the Mediterranean area; some ancient records credit them with causingthe downfall of the Hittite empire. They certainly fought against Egypt andcaused the downfall of Agamemnon’s Mycenae, Nestor’s Pylos, and the new“bungalow” Troy. (Agamemnon, of course, had long been dead, murdered by hiswife, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus, who were in turn killed byAgamemnon’s children, Orestes and Electra.)The identity of the “sea peoples” used to be one of the great mysteries ofancient history: Who were they? Where did they come from? How did they succeedin overthrowing great empires? But the answer that is beginning to emerge showsthat the question itself is too simple. The sea peoples were not a single racialgroup: they came from many countries.We must remember that Mediterranean civilizations were not as stable as thoseof, say, northern Europe. To begin with, the Mediterranean is a poor region,where even today, a large proportion of farmers only scratch out a subsistenceliving. In the midst of this widespread poverty, a few powerful rulers becamerich, usually by plundering their neighbours. Piracy was regarded as arespectable way of living. But such a situation was rather like Al Capone’sChicago; you might become very rich, but you were likely to die violently.In this crime-ridden Mediterranean slum, empires rose and fell fairly quickly.While you were at your peak, you had plenty of allies; but as soon as you werepast your peak, or your attention was distracted elsewhere, your former allieslost no time in attacking you. What happened around 1200 BC was that the twomighty empires – the Egyptian and the Hittite – were buckling, like the earth’stectonic plates under stress, and around 1190 BC there was an earthquake thatcaused a great collapse and released hordes of “criminal rats” all over theMediterranean.The ancient world virtually came to an end. The twelfth century BC was a periodof collapse, a dark age, in which Greece was full of wandering tribes; the ageof great kings and great palaces was over. Recovery came slowly. Around 800 BCGreeks began trading again with overseas partners; some may have settled on thewest coast of Italy and founded the city of Rome. Meanwhile, the Assyriansbecame the new empire builders – the most blood-thirsty and cruel so far. Butthey did not reach Greece, which became a conglomeration of city-states andinvented democracy. Out of the chaos came law giving and a sense of order. Andone of the major voices of this new order was the poet we call Homer, a travelerwith an immense appetite for old tales of gods and heroes. We do not knowwhether Homer memorized these stories or whether he was the first to write themdown, in the days before his blindness. All we know is that he became a legendand that he founded a school of bards who continued his work.If Samuel Butler is correct, Homer’s greatest disciple was a young girl fromSicily, a girl of noble family who shared his passion for ancient tales, and whoone day decided that she would write a sequel to the Iliad, a sequel that wouldnot be a tale of bloodshed and treachery but a gentler story of the aftermath ofthe war, and of noble women as well as heroic men. The result was the Odyssey,the first novel, whose translation into rough-and-ready prose by Samuel Butlerwould inspire a twentieth-century novelist, James Joyce, to create his ownpeculiar version of the Ulysses legend.Much of this story is speculation. All that we can say for certain is that Homer– whether one person or two – created a concept that is now almost synonymouswith the human imagination: the concept of literature."},{"pageContent":"24 The Hope DiamondThe Famous Cursed JewelLike the “skull of doom” (described in chapter 52), the story of the Hopediamond seems to suggest that crystals have some power to absorb human emotions.The diamond was purchased by Louis XIV in 1668 from a French trader namedJean-Baptiste Tavernier, who is believed to have stolen it (like Milton Hayes’s“Green Eye of the Little Yellow God”) from the eye socket of an idol in anIndian temple. (One writer mentions the temple of Rama-sitra, near Mandalay.)Tavernier subsequently went bankrupt, sailed for India to try to recoup hisfortune, and died en route.The King had the diamond cut into the shape of a heart, and it was worn by Mme.de Montespan, the King’s mistress, who was also involved in the notorious“affair of the poisons”, in which a number of old crones who told fortunesprovided poisons for killing off unwanted husbands. Black magic was involved,and an abbé named Guiborg took part in black masses in which babies weresacrificed; the naked body of Mme. de Montespan was used in these ceremonies asan altar. The scandal was suppressed, but Mme. de Montespan fell from favour,and the old crones were secretly tried in the chambre ardente (“candlelitchamber”) and later burned. So after Tavernier, it would seem that Mme. deMontespan was the next person on whom the “French blue” (as it was then known)brought misfortune.A century later the stone was given by Louis XVI to his Queen, Marie Antoinette;her involvement in the scandal of the diamond necklace caused her to lose creditwith the populace and was an indirect cause of the French Revolution in whichshe lost her head. The Princesse de Lamballe, to whom Marie Antoinette lent thediamond, was murdered by a mob.The diamond reappeared in London, but now greatly reduced from its original112.5 carats (22.5 grams) to 44.5 carats – less than half its original size. Itwas purchased in 1830 by the London banker Henry Thomas Hope for £18,000 andfrom then on was known as the Hope diamond. As far as we know, Hope suffered noill effects from the diamond. Neither did any other member of his family untilthe diamond passed into the hands of singer, May Yohe, who married Lord FrancisHope; they were plagued by marital problems, and the wife prophesied that thediamond would bring ill luck to all who owned it. She herself died in poverty,blaming the diamond.Lord Francis, in severe financial trouble, sold it in the early 1900s to aFrench broker, Jacques Colot, who went insane and committed suicide – but notbefore he had sold it to a Russian, Prince Kanitovsi, who lent it to a Frenchactress at the Folies Bergère, then shot her from his box the first night shewore it. He was stabbed by revolutionaries.A Greek jeweler, Simon Mantharides, bought it and later fell over a precipice(or, according to another account, was thrown). The Turkish sultan Abdul Hamid,known as “Abdul the Damned”, bought it in 1908 and was deposed in the followingyear; he went insane. Habib Bey, its next owner, drowned.The diamond then passed, via the French jeweler Pierre Cartier, to America, toEdward Beale Maclean, proprietor of the Washington Post. Soon after he purchasedit, his mother died, and so did two servants in the household. His son,ten-year-old Vinson, who was always heavily protected and watched over, evadedhis minder one day and ran out of the front of the house, where he was knockeddown and killed by a car. Maclean himself parted from his wife, Evalyn, wasinvolved in the famous Teapot Dome scandal, and ended as an insane alcoholic.Evalyn kept the diamond and frequently wore it, dismissing stories about itsmalign properties. But when her daughter committed suicide in 1946 – with anoverdose of sleeping pills – it was recalled that she had worn the diamond ather wedding.After Evalyn Maclean’s death in 1947, all her jewels were purchased by the NewYork jeweler Harry Winston for a sum rumored to be a million dollars. Hedisplayed the diamond in New York but eventually decided to present it to theSmithsonian Institution; the fact that he sent it by ordinary parcel post seemsto indicate that he had no misgivings about the “curse”. The packet is nowexhibited together with the diamond.When it was tested under ultraviolet light at the De Beers Laboratory inJohannesburg in 1965, it continued to glow like a red-hot coal for severalminutes afterwards – a unique phenomenon among diamonds.Skeptics regard the curse of the Hope diamond, like “the curse of Tutankhamen”as mythical, pointing out that many of its owners suffered no misfortune. Yetwhile skepticism may be the correct attitude in this case, it would undoubtedlybe premature to dismiss the whole notion of curses as superstition. The late T.C. Lethbridge (see chapter 60) was convinced that tragedies and unpleasantevents can leave behind their “imprints” on the places where they occurred – atheory first put forward in the early twentieth century by Sir Oliver Lodge, whofelt that certain so-called hauntings could be explained as a kind of“recording”. Lethbridge called such recordings “ghouls” – meaning the unpleasantsensations that may be experienced in certain places. When he was eighteen heand his mother had been on a walk in the Great Wood near Wokingham when theyboth felt suddenly depressed. Later they learned that the body of a man who hadcommitted suicide had been lying close to the spot where they were standing;Lethbridge believed that the man’s depression had been somehow “recorded” by hissurroundings. Four decades later Lethbridge and his wife, Mina, set out oneafternoon to collect seaweed from a nearby beach – Ladram, in Devon. As theywalked to the beach, Lethbridge again experienced a “blanket” of depression, asif he had walked into a fog. A few minutes later Mina said, “I can’t stand thisplace any longer”, and they left.The following weekend they repeated the trip. Again, he experienced the same“blanket of depression”. This time Mina went to the top of a cliff to make asketch and suddenly experienced an unpleasant sensation, as if someone wasurging her to jump.Later, Lethbridge discovered that a man had recently committed suicide byjumping from the spot where Mina had been standing. He concluded that this wasagain the reason for the depression; the man’s misery had somehow been“recorded” on the electrical field of water. (Both days had been warm and damp,and he had also noted that a small stream ran on to the beach at the point wherethe “depression” was strongest.) It was not the suicide’s ghost that was urgingMina to jump; rather, she was responding to his own suggestion of jumping. Thisnotion of “tape recording” lies behind the theory of psychometry, the ability ofcertain people to “read” the history of an object by holding it in their hands(see chapter 43).Clairvoyants believe that crystals possess this power of absorption to a highdegree – hence the popularity of crystal balls, which are kept wrapped in blackvelvet to protect them from light and heat (on the same principle that recordedtapes should not be left in hot sunlight or on radiators).There is also a great deal of documentation on “curses”, which seems to indicatethat certain objects can carry “bad luck”. For example, a whole book has beendevoted to the career of the ship called The Great Eastern, built by the greatnineteenth-century engineer Isambard Brunel. During its construction, a riveterand his boy apprentice vanished; no one realized that they had been sealed intothe hull. The ship (the largest ever built at that time) got stuck during itslaunching and took three months to free. Brunel then collapsed on its deck anddied a week later. From then on the career of The Great Eastern was a longseries of disasters. Five firemen died when a funnel exploded. While in port forrepairs, the ship was damaged in a storm. The captain was drowned in a boat witha cabin boy. A sailor was crushed by the wheel; a man was lost overboard. Thedisasters and the damage continued until the ship was abandoned, a mere fifteenyears after its launching. When it was broken up for scrap, the skeletons of theriveter and his apprentice were found sealed in the hull.Many similar stories could be told of “jinxed” ships, houses, airplanes, andcars.9 [CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2235289] The carin which the Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated at Sarajevo (thus precipitatingthe First World War) went on to bring death or disaster to its next sevenowners.Now if Lethbridge is correct, and a curse is merely a kind of negative taperecording, it also suggests a reason why some people may be affected and othersescape unscathed. Lethbridge believed that “sensitives” like himself – forexample, good dowsers – would be unusually receptive to these “recordings”,while other people would not even notice them.If physical objects – like crystals – are sensitive to the vibrations of thehuman mind, it would also seem to follow that under certain circumstances, a“curse” might be deliberately imprinted on them – rather like marking one’spossessions with an invisible marking pen. The ancient Egyptians certainlybelieved that their tombs could be “cursed” against robbers. The priests of thetemple of Rama-sitra may have taken the same precaution with the Hope diamond."},{"pageContent":"25 The Mystery of HypnosisReal-Life Svengalis and the Telepathy TheoryIn May 1991 a hypnotist named Nelson Nelson (his real name was Nelson Lintott)was tried in Bristol Crown Court on the charge of raping and/or otherwisesexually assaulting 113 girls under hypnosis. Nelson, fifty-seven, hadapparently learned hypnosis in South Africa at a party. After a varied career asa driving instructor, swimming pool superintendent, barkeep, and restaurateur,he established the Britannia Lodge Health Centre in Appledore, Devon, where,among other things, he undertook to cure people of all kinds of complaints, fromnail biting to smoking.While the girls were in a trance, Nelson would remove their clothes and commitsexual assaults that were described in court as “perverted”. Nelson alsovideotaped many of these assaults. His downfall came when one of his employeesborrowed a videotape from his bedroom without permission and found that itcontained footage of Nelson undressing girls who appeared to be in a trance andcommitting sexual acts with them. The employee went to the police, who raidedNelson’s premises and found a video camera behind a two-way mirror in hisbathroom. They also found forty-five videotapes, loaded guns, and numerousphotographs that Nelson had taken over the years; the latter featured 113different girls and women, ranging in age from ten to thirty-four.One girl who had worked for Nelson as a barmaid from the age of sixteendescribed how he had hypnotized her twice a week over a long period to cure herof nail biting. While she was under hypnosis, Nelson had induced her to commitvarious sex acts; the girl was “distraught and horrified” when she viewed thevideotapes and realized what had been happening. Other girls – the policesucceeded in identifying 112 out of the 113 – were equally astonished to learnwhat had happened to them.Nelson was sentenced to eleven years’ imprisonment.The case appears to contradict one of the most basic assertions of psychiatricmedicine – that no one can be made to perform acts under hypnosis that he or shewould not perform when awake. A mischievous student of the greatnineteenth-century French doctor – and hypnotist – Jean-Martin Charcot tried tomake a hypnotized girl remove her clothes in a medical class; she immediatelywoke up. As to criminal acts, the general view is stated by Bernard Hollander inhis book Hypnosis and Self-Hypnosis (1928): “Criminal suggestions would beaccepted only by criminal minds”.The general public became fascinated by hypnosis in the last years of thenineteenth century, when George Du Maurier’s novel Trilby (1894) achievedtremendous success. It tells the story of an attractive artist’s model (Trilby)in the Latin Quarter of Paris, who is one day hypnotized by a Hungarian musiciannamed Svengali in order to cure her headache. Three young English artists firmlyrefuse to allow him to hypnotize her again. But when the English men leaveParis, Svengali again approaches Trilby and hypnotizes her into becoming a greatsinger. (In her normal state, she cannot even sing in tune.) When her Englishfriends see Trilby again, she fails to recognize them and merely looks vague andconfused – until Svengali murmurs something in her ear, whereupon she becomescold and hostile. Later, when Svengali is stabbed by a fellow musician, shebecomes virtually an imbecile. And when he dies, she loses all memory of heryears as Svengali’s “slave”. Without her sinister master, her vitality seems todrain away, and she also dies.Svengali became one of the most famous villains of the century, and his namebecame a synonym for an evil manipulator, someone who takes over another’s will.(The book implied, of course, that Trilby was also Svengali’s “sex slave”.) Butsince hypnosis was by that time beginning to achieve a certain medicalrespectability, psychiatrists lost no time in assuring the public that areal-life Svengali was an impossibility. If a person under hypnosis was orderedto do something that he would normally find repugnant, he would instantly wakeup. Charcot’s mischievous student might have induced the girl to undress if hehad told her that she was in her own bedroom, about to go to bed; otherwise, hernatural modesty would have caused her to wake up.The hypnosis of human beings dates from the last years of the eighteenthcentury. Hypnosis of animals has been known in Europe since 1636, when themathematician Daniel Schwenter observed that if a small piece of bent wood wasfixed on a hen’s beak, the hen would stare at it and go into a trance. The samething would happen if a hen’s head was held on the ground and a chalk line drawnin front of its beak. Ten years later a German Jesuit priest, AthanasiusKircher, described how, if a hen’s head was tucked under its wing, a few gentleswings through the air would send it into a trance. French peasants still usethis method at market when buying a live hen. Africans probably knew aboutanimal hypnosis long before that; in his book Hypnosis of Men and Animals(1966), Ferenc Volgyesi describes how wild elephants can be tamed by tying themto a tree and waving leafy boughs in front of their eyes until they blink andbecome docile.The man with whose name hypnosis is usually associated – Franz Mesmer – was, infact, the discoverer of a completely different technique. Convinced that ourhealth depends upon the flow of “vital currents” around the body, Mesmer came tobelieve that the flow could be increased by stroking with magnets. When, later,he observed that bleeding increased or decreased when he moved his hand abovethe bleeding, he concluded that human beings exercise “animal magnetism”. He“magnetized” trees and got his patients to embrace them; he magnetized tubs ofwater and made his patients sit with their feet in them. All of this wassupposed to increase the flow of vital energy around their bodies.One of Mesmer’s disciples, Armand Marie Jacques de Chastenet, the Marquis dePuységur, practiced “mesmerism” on his estate at Buzancy. One day he tied ayoung peasant named Victor Race – whom he was treating for asthma – to a tree,and was making “mesmeric” passes over him when Race’s eyes closed. Yet hecontinued to reply to Puységur’s remarks. And on Puységur’s orders, he untiedhimself and walked off across the park. Puységur had discovered hypnosis. Healso made another important discovery that has since been forgotten. He couldgive Race mental orders – for example, to repeat the words of a song that he wassinging mentally – and Race would obey them. With another excellent hypnoticsubject named Madeleine, Puységur would give public demonstrations of mindreading; one total skeptic was converted when he himself was able to orderMadeleine – mentally – to put her hand in his pocket and take out an object hehad placed there. This ability to influence hypnotized subjects telepathicallywas demonstrated again and again during the nineteenth century; but medicine hascontinued to dismiss it as a myth.Mesmer’s enemies drove him out of Paris and Vienna; he died, discredited andembittered, in 1815. And the medical profession made sure that hypnosis wastreated as a fraud throughout the nineteenth century; any doctor who practicedit was likely to be struck off the register. It was only toward the end of thecentury that Charcot rediscovered it. Charcot had noticed that patientssuffering from hysteria behaved as if they were hypnotized. For example, a manwho was convinced that his arm was paralyzed would behave exactly as if it wasparalyzed, although there was nothing physically wrong with his arm. But hecould be cured by being told under hypnosis that his arm was not paralyzed – andthe paralysis could also be reinduced by hypnosis. When Charcot announced to themedical profession that hypnosis was simply a form of hysteria, his colleaguesbelieved that he had solved the mystery and ceased to regard hypnosis as afraud. It took some time before it was recognized that Charcot had inverted thetruth and that hysteria is, in fact, a kind of hypnosis. A hysterical patientbecomes convinced that he is suffering from some disability and “suggests”himself into it. Freud was one of the many who were impressed by Charcot’stheory of hypnosis; he later made it the basis of his own theory of theunconscious.But what precisely is hypnosis? This is a question that no one at that timecould answer – and that remains (officially, at all events) unanswered today.Bernard Hollander’s book includes a chapter entitled “Explanation of Hypnosis”that has some useful suggestions. He points out that a subject under hypnosisforgets his body; if his attention is drawn to his body, it feels heavy andimmobile. Yet the patient is not asleep. Hollander compares a hypnotized patientto someone absorbed in a play – the mind is wide-awake but totally abstracted.We have all seen a child staring at the television with his thumb in his mouth,so absorbed that he has to be prodded to gain his attention. This seems to implythat we have two minds, one of which deals with the world that surrounds us andcopes with immediate experience, while the other can go off “inside itself”,into a subjective world, a kind of cinema inside the head.At about the time Freud was studying under Charcot in Paris, an Americannewspaper editor named Thomson Jay Hudson was also puzzling over the mystery ofhypnosis. Hudson had attended a hypnotic performance by the eminent physiologistWilliam B. Carpenter in Washington, D.C., and what he saw amazed him. Carpenterplaced a young college graduate under hypnosis and asked him if he would like tomeet Socrates. The young man objected that Socrates was dead, and Carpenter toldhim that he had the power to evoke the spirit of Socrates. Then he pointed to acorner of the room and exclaimed, “There he is”. The young man – whom Hudsoncalled C. – looked awestruck. Carpenter then urged C. to enter into conversationwith Socrates and ask him any question he liked – mentioning that, since theaudience could not hear Socrates, C. would have to repeat his replies aloud. Forthe next two hours the audience witnessed an incredible conversation, in whichthe replies of Socrates seemed so brilliant and plausible that some of theaudience – who were interested in Spiritualism – were inclined to believe thatSocrates was actually there.After this Carpenter introduced C. to the spirits of various modernphilosophers, and more brilliant and plausible conversations followed. Thesewere quite different from one another and from the conversation with Socrates –although they usually had nothing whatever in common with the ideas of thephilosophers under interrogation. Finally, to convince the audience that theywere not listening to the words of spirits, Carpenter summoned a philosophicpig, which discoursed learnedly on Hinduism.What impressed Hudson was that C. was obviously of fairly average intelligence,whereas the answers of the philosophers were close to genius level. Obviously,C.’s “unconscious mind” – or whatever it was – was far cleverer than he was. Andas Hudson studied similar cases he came to the conclusion that we possess twominds – what he called the “objective mind”, which copes with everyday reality,and the “subjective mind”, which can become totally absorbed in an inner world.C. only became a man of genius under hypnosis, when the operations of hisobjective mind, like those of his body, were suspended. Then the subjective mindcould operate freely. In other words, the objective mind serves as a kind ofanchor, or ball-and-chain, on the subjective mind. But men of great genius,Hudson concluded, have an odd faculty for allowing the two to work in harmony –like children. He cited the case of an American orator, Henry Clay, who was oncecalled upon to answer an opponent in the Senate when he was ill. He asked thefriend sitting next to him to tug on his coattails when he had been speaking forten minutes. Two hours later he sank down exhausted – then looked at the clockand asked his friend why he had failed to interrupt. The friend explained thathe had not only tugged at Clay’s coattails, he had pinched him repeatedly andeven jabbed a pin into his leg. Clay had remained totally oblivious to all this.It would seem that Clay was in the same trancelike state as the child watchingtelevision with his thumb in his mouth, and that it was, in fact, a kind ofhypnosis.The theory that Hudson developed in his book The Law of Psychic Phenomena (1893)is that the “subjective mind” has virtually miraculous powers. All men of genius– particularly those whose talent seems to burst forth like a wellspring, suchas Shakespeare and Mozart – are able to tune in at will to the enormous powersof the subjective mind. The miracles of Jesus, and of various saints, weresimply manifestations of the same mysterious power.Hudson himself became convinced that he could also perform miracles of healingwith the aid of the subjective mind and decided to try to cure a relative ofsevere rheumatism that had almost killed him. The man lived a thousand milesaway. Hudson decided that the best time to send “healing suggestions” was on theedge of sleep, when the “objective mind” is passive – exactly as in hypnosis. On15 May 1890, he told a number of friends that he meant to start the experiment.A few months later one of the friends met the invalid and found that he was wellagain; the attacks had ceased and he was working normally. Asked when theattacks ceased, he said, “About mid-May” – exactly when Hudson had started his“experiments”.Hudson claimed that he went on to cure about five hundred people in the sameway. He failed in only two cases and these – oddly enough – were patients whohad been told that he intended to try to cure them.This, Hudson believed, underlined another peculiarity of the subjective mind:its powers have to work spontaneously, without self-consciousness. As soon as itbecomes self-conscious, it freezes up, like the hand of a schoolboy when theteacher looks over his shoulder as he is writing. This also explains why so many“psychics” fail when they are tested by skeptics. It is like trying to make lovein a crowded public square.Because we have two minds, our powers tend to interfere with one another. In the1870s a stage hypnotist named Carl Hansen loved to demonstrate a spectaculartrick; he would tell the hypnotized subject that he (the subject) was about tobecome as rigid as a board. The subject was then placed across two chairs, withhis head on one and his heels on the other, and several people would sit orstand on his stomach; he never bent in the middle. What happened was that theobjective mind had been put to sleep, and the hypnotist then took over the roleof the objective mind. Normally, “you” tell your body to stand up or sit down.But “you” are often negative or tired or unsure of yourself, so your “orders”are given in a hesitant voice. We are undermined by self-doubt. The hypnotistdelivers his orders like a sergeant major, and this has the effect of unlockingthe powers of the subjective mind. It obviously follows that if you could learnto give orders with the same assurance, you would also be capable of“miraculous” feats.But in that case, why aren’t self-confident people capable of miraculous feats?Because they have developed the objective mind, the conscious “self” that copeswith reality, rather than the subjective mind. Genius – and miracles – is aboutcontact between the two minds.Hudson was also certain that all so-called psychic phenomena are due to thepowers of the subjective mind. He attended a séance at which a pencil wrote ofits own accord on a slate, delivering messages that were relevant to Hudson andto the other “sitter”, a general. Yet when thinking it over later, Hudsonconcluded that nothing was written that could not have emanated from the mind ofthe medium, if the medium had telepathic powers. He decided that the medium had– unconsciously – read the mind of his sitters and then used the miraculouspowers of his own subjective mind to make the pencil write on the slate. And ifthat was possible, Hudson argued, then all psychical phenomena, including ghostsand poltergeists, could be explained in the same way. In fact, Hudson was aheadof his time. It would be several years before psychical researchers came to theconclusion that poltergeists are due to the unconscious minds of disturbedadolescents.Here it could be argued that Hudson was carried away by his own brilliantinsights into the powers of the subjective mind. I have argued elsewhere thatthe evidence for “spirits” cannot be so easily dismissed. In fact, he was quitedefinitely wrong when he came to deal with the curious power known aspsychometry, the ability of certain people to “read” the history of an objectthey hold in their hands. Some of the most remarkable tests in the history ofpsychical research were carried out by a professor of geology named WilliamDenton. He would wrap geological and archaeological specimens in thick brownpaper packages, shuffle them until he no longer knew which was which, then gethis “psychometrists” – his wife and sister-in-law – to describe the contents andhistory of packages chosen at random. Their accuracy was amazing – for example,a fragment of volcanic lava from Pompeii produced an accurate description of theeruption, while a fragment of tile from a Roman villa produced a description ofRoman legions and a man who looked like a retired soldier. However, this latterexperiment worried Denton, because the tile came from the villa of the oratorCicero, who was tall and thin, and the “soldier” was described as heavily built.It was only some years later, after publishing his first account, that Dentonlearned that the villa had also belonged to the Roman dictator Sulla, who didcorrespond accurately to the description.But all this leaves Hudson’s central insight untouched: that man has two mindsand it is because of these two minds impede each other instead of supportingeach other that our powers are so limited. His basic proposition is that if wecould learn to tap the powers of the subjective mind, we would develop intosupermen.Hudson’s book became a bestseller and went into edition after edition between1893 and Hudson’s death in 1903. Why, then, did its remarkable new theory notmake a far greater impact? The reason can be summarized in a single word: Freud.The objective and subjective minds obviously correspond roughly to Freud’s egoand id – or conscious and unconscious. But there is a major difference. Freudwas a pessimist who saw the unconscious mind as a passive force, a kind ofbasement full of decaying rubbish that causes disease – or neurosis. Theconscious mind is the victim of these unconscious forces, which are basicallysexual in nature. Hudson would have been horrified at such a gloomy and negativeview of the subjective mind. But because Freud was a “scientist” and Hudson wasmerely a retired newspaper editor, the latter’s achievement was ignored bypsychologists.Yet the “two minds” theory was to receive powerful scientific backing a fewdecades later. Even in the nineteenth century it had been recognized that thetwo halves of our brains have different functions. The speech function residesin the left half of the brain; doctors observed that people with left-braindamage became inarticulate. The right side of the brain controls recognition ofshapes and patterns, so that an artist who had right-brain damage would lose allartistic talent. One man could not even draw a clover leaf; he put the threeleaves of the clover side by side, on the same level.Yet an artist with left-brain damage only became inarticulate; he was still asgood an artist as ever. And an orator with right- brain damage could sound aseloquent as ever, even though he could not draw a clover leaf.The left brain also governs logic and reason, which are involved in such tasksas adding up a laundry list or doing a crossword puzzle. The right is involvedin such activities as musical appreciation or facial recognition. In short, youcould say that the left is a scientist and the right is an artist.One of the odd facts of human physiology is that the left side of the body iscontrolled by the right side of the brain, and vice versa. No one quite knowswhy this is, except that it probably makes for greater integration. If the leftbrain controlled the left side and the right brain the right side, there mightbe “frontier disputes”; as it is, each has a foot firmly in the other’sterritory.If you removed the top of your head, the upper part of your brain – the cerebralhemispheres – would look like a walnut with a kind of bridge connecting the twohalves. This bridge is a knot of nerves called the corpus callosum, orcommissure. But doctors learned that there are some freaks who possess nocommissure yet seem to function perfectly well. This led them to wonder if theycould prevent epileptic attacks by severing the commissure. They tried it onepileptics and it seemed to work. The fits were greatly reduced, and thepatients seemed to be unchanged. It led the doctors to wonder what the functionof the commissure was. Someone suggested it might be to transmit epilepticseizures; another suggested it might be to keep the brain from sagging in themiddle.In the 1950s experiments in America began to shed a good deal of light on theproblem. Someone noticed that if a “split-brain” patient knocked against a tablewith his left side, he didn’t seem to notice. It began to emerge that thesplit-brain operation had the effect of preventing one half of the brain fromlearning what the other half knew. If a cat was taught a trick with one eyecovered, then asked to do it with the other eye covered, it was baffled. Itbecame clear that we literally have two brains.10[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2235473]Moreover, if a split-brain patient was shown an apple with the left eye and anorange with the right, then asked what he had just seen, he would reply,“Orange”. Asked to write what he had just seen with his left hand, he wouldwrite Apple. A split-brain patient who was shown a dirty picture with her rightbrain blushed; asked why she was blushing, she replied truthfully, “I don’tknow”. The person who was doing the blushing was the one who lived in the righthalf of her brain. She lived in the left half.This is true of all of us (except left-handed individuals, whose brainhemispheres are reversed). The person you call “you” lives in the left half –the half that “copes” with the real world. The person who lives in the right isa stranger.You might object that you and I are not split-brain patients. That makes nodifference. Mozart once remarked that tunes were always walking into his headfully fledged, and all he had to do was write them down. Where did they comefrom? Obviously, from the right half of his brain, the “artist”. Where did theygo to? To the left half of his brain, where Mozart lived. In other words, Mozartwas a split-brain patient. And if Mozart was, then so are the rest of us. Theperson we call “I” is the scientist. The “artist” lives in the shadows, and weare scarcely aware of his existence, except in moods of deep relaxation or of“inspiration”. We all become more “right brain”, for example, after an alcoholicdrink; it makes us more aware of our “other half”. It does this, to some extent,by anesthetizing the left brain (which explains why you find it harder to do amathematical problem when you have had a few glasses of wine). This is whyalcohol is so popular. The same – unfortunately – applies to other drugs.We can see that the left and right halves of the brain correspond roughly toHudson’s objective and subjective minds. And how does this help us to understandhypnosis? Well, it would seem that the hypnotist “anesthetizes” the left brain –makes it fall asleep – while the right remains wide awake. If Hudson is correct– and there seems every reason to believe that he is – the right brain is thenable to operate with the full powers of the subjective mind. There seem to beobvious clues here to how we could all make better use of our powers.According to modern medicine, hypnosis merely enables you to relax and becomeless self-conscious. It has no power to make you “superhuman”. Yet once again,this is contradicted by the facts. We have already seen that the Marquis dePuységur was able to communicate telepathically with Victor Race when Victor wasin a trance. And anyone who takes the trouble to look into the four volumes ofEric J. Dingwall’s Abnormal Hypnotic Phenomena – which is devoted mainly to thenineteenth century – will find dozens of cases that leave no doubt whatever that“telepathy under hypnosis” has been demonstrated over and over again. One ofDingwall’s most astonishing accounts concerns the brothers Alexis and AdolpheDidier, who could both perform remarkable paranormal feats under hypnosis. Forexample, the two would play a game of cards with cards that were turnedfacedown. Nevertheless, one brother would be able to tell his partner whichcards the other held, as if he were looking over his shoulder.The father of the Didiers was himself a remarkable hypnotic subject who wouldsometimes go into a trance at the breakfast table while reading the newspaper –and continue reading the newspaper although he had dropped it onto the table andwas not looking at it. Alexis, the more talented of the two brothers, wasparticularly expert at “traveling clairvoyance”. The person he was talking tocould ask him to describe what he (the “client”) had been doing that day, or to“travel” to his home and describe it. This sounds as if it could be explained bytelepathy – except that Didier could tell the client things he did not knowhimself. On one occasion Didier described a magistrate’s study with greataccuracy and mentioned that there was a bell on the table; the magistrate deniedthis. But when he got home he found that Didier was correct; his wife had placedthe bell there since he had left home.Alfred Russel Wallace, codeveloper (with Darwin) of the theory of evolution inthe mid-nineteenth century, became interested in hypnosis when he was a youngschoolteacher, and he discovered that some of his pupils were excellent hypnoticsubjects. One boy would actually share Wallace’s perceptions when in a trance;if Wallace pinched his own arm, the boy started and rubbed his arm; if Wallacetasted sugar, the boy smiled and licked his lips; if Wallace tasted salt, theboy grimaced.In the 1880s, the French psychologist Pierre Janet was able to place one of hispatients, a woman named Leonie, in a hypnotic trance from the other side of LeHavre and summon her to come to him. The experiments were performed under testconditions under the auspices of the Society for Psychical Research.Almost a century later Dr Gustav Pagenstecher discovered that one of hispatients, Maria Reyes de Zierold, was able to share his own sensations, tastingsubstances he put on his tongue and wincing if he held his hand over a lightedmatch. The first time he hypnotized her, she told him that her daughter waslistening at the door; Pagenstecher opened the door and found that this wastrue. This sounds as if she may simply have heard the girl outside; but she wasalso able to describe what Pagenstecher was doing when he was in the next room.Under hypnosis, Maria also became an excellent psychometrist and could describewith great accuracy the history of objects placed in her hands.11[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2236019]All of this obviously raises a fascinating possibility – that hypnosis may notmerely involve placing someone in a trance through suggestion but that it mightbe the direct influence of one mind upon another. In Over the Long High Wall,writer J. B. Priestley tells how, at a boring literary dinner in New York, hetold the person sitting next to him that he intended to try to make one of thepoets wink at him. He chose a serious-looking woman, “no winker”, andconcentrated on her. After a while she turned and winked at him. Priestley’sneighbour was inclined to doubt whether it had been a wink, but after thedinner, the woman came up to him to apologize for winking at him, remarking, “Idon’t know what made me do it”.This brings us back to the question raised at the beginning of this article:whether a hypnotist can influence someone to commit a criminal act against hiswill. The evidence suggests that it is possible. In 1865, in France, a vagabondnamed Thimotheus Castellan was tried for abducting and raping a young peasantgirl named Josephine. He had knocked on the door of her father’s cottage,begging shelter for the night. The next morning, when the father and brothershad gone off to work, neighbours noticed him making passes in the air behindJosephine’s back. Over the midday meal, Castellan made a movement with hisfingers, and she felt her senses leaving her; he then carried her into the nextroom and raped her. She said she wanted to resist but was paralyzed. Later, heleft and took her with him, demonstrating his power over her at various farmswhere they stayed by making her walk on all fours like an animal. He was finallyarrested and sentenced to twelve years in prison.In 1934 a Heidelberg hypnotist named Franz Walter met a woman on a train andcaused her to pass into a trance simply by taking her hand. After raping her, heordered her to work for him as a prostitute. He subsequently ordered her to makeseveral attempts on her husband’s life; when these failed, he ordered her tocommit suicide. She was saved by passersby on two occasions. Finally, a policesurgeon guessed that she had been hypnotized and ordered to keep silent aboutit; he succeeded in “unlocking” her memory, and Franz Walter was sentenced toten years in prison.In 1985 two Portuguese criminals, both named Manuel, succeeded in parting anumber of victims from their life savings through hypnosis. One woman describedhow she had simply been talking to one of the men when he took her hand and shefelt “cold all over”, then went into a stupor in which she obeyed orders to gohome and withdraw her savings; she handed over more than £1,000. The two menwere caught by accident when a hairdresser heard one of her clients agreeing(over the telephone) to meet them and give them money; she had heard of theearlier case and notified the police. The men were deported.12[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2236263]All of this seems to suggest that there is a telepathic element in hypnosis – ofone mind directly influencing another – and that legends about real-lifeSvengalis may have some basis in fact. Ferenc Volgyesi, whose book Hypnosis inMen and Animals has already been mentioned, was convinced that legends about the“hypnotic gaze” of the snake were not without foundation; he cites examples oftoads, frogs, and rabbits being “transfixed by a snake’s gaze”, which involvedthe expansion of its pupils; but he has photographs of other creatures engagedin “battles of will” in which they simply stare at each other. In one case, atoad won a “battle of will” against a snake.This is not, of course, to deny the validity of the generally accepted theory ofhypnosis – that it is basically a matter of suggestion. Hypnosis, as we haveseen, is based on a state of abstraction, and hypnotists undoubtedly create thisstate by suggestion – usually by suggesting that the subject is becoming sleepy,that his limbs are becoming heavy, and so on. But it is the right brain – the“other you” – that accepts these suggestions and puts “you” to sleep, while itremains wide awake. Its powers are then at the disposal of the hypnotist (whichsuggests, in turn, that a good hypnotic subject ought to be able to cure peopleat a distance, as Hudson did).What seems to have happened, in the case of Nelson Nelson, the rapist describedat the beginning of this chapter, is that his suggestions made his patientstotally unaware of their bodies and that he committed the sexual assaults whilethe patients were virtually asleep, as if under anesthesia.But it would be a mistake to assume that this supports the view that a hypnotistcould not persuade an unwilling subject to submit to sexual intercourse. In hisbook Open to Suggestion (1989), a study of the abuse of hypnosis, Robert Templedevotes a whole chapter to rape under hypnosis. One assault victim describes howthe hypnotist raised her bra and caressed her breasts, yet she still made afurther appointment. The next time, after placing her in a light trance,> he caressed my breast again and after a while pulled down my pants and> panties, and he even put his hand in my vagina . . . He wanted me to take his> genitals in my hand. I said no . . . After a while I held his penis . . . I> would have liked to have knocked him away, but in one way or another I> couldn’t do it. [When] he started to get closer with his genitals, I started> to panic and cried.> > Here it seems clear that she had no more desire to be raped than the victim ofthe two Portuguese criminals had to hand over her life savings. This is clearlya case in which – as with Thimotheus Castellan and Franz Walter – the will ofthe hypnotist prevailed over the will of the victim. Temple also cites a case ofa homosexual assault on a soldier by a hypnotist – his colonel – in which thesoldier felt immobilized and unable to get up from the bed, although he objectedto the colonel’s advances.Temple himself describes a personal episode that throws an interesting light onhypnosis. He was undergoing a course of hypnotic treatment and one day failed to“wake up”. But because he was aware that his doctor was in a hurry to get away,he pretended to be fully conscious. Outside, he told his wife – who was waitingin the car – that he was still hypnotized and asked her to blow on his face; shethought it funny and screamed with laughter. On the way home, he saw a tree andordered her to stop. Then he went and embraced the tree and burst into tears,telling it how beautiful it was. After that he lay on his back, staring at thenight sky and uttering maudlin remarks. In fact, he behaved exactly as if drunk.Back at home, he drank down half a glass of neat gin – a drink he disliked – andfinally “came to”. It is clear that he knew that a part of his mind was stillunder hypnosis but was unable to awaken it.This raises another important point. William James has pointed out that thereare certain days on which we feel that our vital powers are simply not at theirbest; “our fires are damped; our draughts are checked”. We feel curiously dull,like a car whose engine is still cold and that keeps “cutting out”. In fact, theremarkable teacher Gurdjieff asserted that our ordinary consciousness isliterally a state of sleep and that we have to make superhuman efforts if we areto wake up. (Hypnosis comes from the Greek hypnos – “sleep”.)Clearly, then, hypnosis is not some abnormal, freak condition that we canignore. It offers clues to what is wrong with human beings and to why it is theeasiest thing in the world to waste one’s life. Our basic problem is to “shakethe mind awake”.Notice that when we are dull and bored, we feel “alienated” from reality. Wefeel trapped in the physical world and in the present moment; “reality” is aprison. This is the opposite of what happens when we are happy and excited – forexample, when looking forward to some eagerly anticipated event – or when we aredeeply relaxed. In these states, the world seems infinitely fascinating; realityseems to stretch around us in endless vistas, like a view from a mountaintop.It is obvious that in such states, the right and left brains are in closecommunication. When you are bored, you are trapped – not only in the physicalworld, but in your left brain. You are, in essence, a split-brain patient. Thesame thing happens if you are absorbed in a daydream, except that in this caseyou are trapped in your inner world – your right brain. If you spend too muchtime in such states – what is sometimes called “escapism” – you begin to findthe real world unbearable, and you alternate between being trapped insideyourself and feeling trapped in the physical world.On the other hand, in moods of happiness or relaxation, you become, for a shorttime, a “whole-brain” patient. Your right brain – your intuitive self – nowfeels awake, and you realize that this “whole” state is far closer to what humanconsciousness was intended to be. One of the oddest things about these states isthat, when we look back on our miseries and misfortunes, most of them seemlaughably trivial, the result of the lopsided half-consciousness that we regardas “normal”.The French philosopher Sartre had a word for these states in which we feeltrapped in the present moment: “nausea”. And, oddly enough, he regarded “nausea”as the fundamental reality of human existence – what you might call the basicstate of human consciousness – rather like seeing an attractive woman with herhair in curlers and cold cream smeared all over her face. It follows, of course,that Sartre felt that human life is meaningless and that – as he put it in afamous phrase – “man is a useless passion”. His close associate Simone deBeauvoir captured the spirit of “nausea” when she wrote: “I look at myself invain in a mirror, tell myself my own story. I can never grasp myself as anentire object. I experience in myself the emptiness that is myself. I feel thatI am not”. But obviously, she was simply talking about the experience of beingtrapped in left-brain consciousness. Yet it is quite clear that she was mistakenwhen she said that she could never grasp herself as an entire object and thatshe felt “she is not”. In “whole-brain” states, we have a curious sense of ourown reality and that of the world. We suddenly know that “we are”.What is so interesting here is that Sartre’s whole philosophy of human existence– he is known as one of the founding figures of existentialism – is based on hismistaken notion that “nausea” is some fundamental truth about human reality –the beautiful woman in hair curlers. Moreover, it is a philosophy that is echoedby some of the most respectable figures in modern literature, from ErnestHemingway and Albert Camus to Graham Greene and Samuel Beckett. It could be saidto dominate modern philosophy and modern literature. Yet we can see that it issimply a misunderstanding. “Nausea” is not some glimpse of reality; it is asunimportant as a headache, and in some ways curiously similar. If Sartre hadknown about the right and left hemispheres, he would have recognized that he wasgreatly exaggerating the importance of “nausea”. And if we could grasp, once andfor all, that “alienation” in left-brain consciousness is not a glimpse of thereality of the human condition, we would experience an enormous and immediaterise in our level of optimism and vitality.There is another important inference to be drawn from all this. Hypnosis, as wehave seen, is basically suggestion. The hypnotist’s suggestion (“your eyelidsare feeling heavy . . .”) has the effect of trapping us in left-brainconsciousness. Boredom and pessimism have the same effect. But if you believe –like Sartre – that life is meaningless and “man is a useless passion”, then youare in a permanent condition of negative self-suggestion, and entrapment inleft-brain consciousness becomes your normal mode of awareness. So “nausea”becomes a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. Entrapment in left-brainconsciousness is bad enough, but it becomes ten times worse if you accept it asa norm. On the other hand, if you are aware that whole-brain consciousness isthe norm, then states of “trapped” left-brain consciousness would be accepted ascasually as a headache.This, then, is the real importance of Puységur’s discovery of hypnosis. It wasthe recognition of a curious anomaly that raised enormous questions about thehuman mind. The total eclipse of hypnosis during the nineteenth century revealsthat these questions were too uncomfortable to be faced; it was easier todismiss them and to stick to the old commonsense view of human awareness. Now wefind ourselves at an interesting crossroads when we accept the reality ofhypnosis (although there are still a few academics who dismiss it as a delusion)yet fail to grasp its implications. When these are finally grasped and taken forgranted by every high school student – as we now take for granted the notion ofthe unconscious mind or of childhood eroticism – man will be prepared to begin avoyage of discovery into his own unexplored potentialities."},{"pageContent":"26 The Enigma of Identical TwinsOne Mind in Two BodiesWhen Jim Lewis was six years old, he learned that he had an identical twinbrother. Their unmarried mother had put them up for adoption soon after theywere born in August 1939. Jim had been adopted by a couple named Lewis in Lima,Ohio; his brother was adopted by a family named Springer in Dayton, Ohio. Oddlyenough, both boys were christened “Jim” by their new parents.In 1979, when he was thirty-nine, Jim Lewis decided to try to find his twinbrother. The court that had arranged the adoption was exceptionally helpful. Sixweeks later, Jim Lewis knocked on the door of Jim Springer in Dayton. The momentthey shook hands they felt close, as if they had been together all their lives.But when they began to compare notes they became aware of a staggering series ofcoincidences. To begin with, they had the same health problems. Both werecompulsive nail-biters and suffered from insomnia. Both had started toexperience migraines at the age of eighteen, and stopped having them at the sameage. Both had heart problems. Both had developed haemorrhoids. They were exactlythe same weight, but had both put on ten pounds at exactly the same period oftheir lives, and then lost it again at the same time.All this might seem to indicate that genetic programming is far more precise andcomplex than anyone had suspected. But their coincidences went much further thangenetics. Both had married girls named Linda, divorced, then married girlscalled Betty. Both had named their sons James Allan. Both had owned a dog namedToy. Both had worked as deputy sheriff, petrol-station attendant, and atMcDonald’s Hamburger restaurants. Both spent their holidays on the same Floridabeach. Both chain-smoked the same make of cigarette. Both had basement workshopsin which they made furniture . . .The twins were fascinated, not only by these similarities in experience but bytheir mental similarities – one would start to say something and the other wouldfinish it.Their reunion received wide press coverage, and they appeared on the JohnnyCarson chat show. And in Minnesota a psychologist named Tom Bouchard was sointrigued that he persuaded the University to give him a grant to study the “Jimtwins” scientifically. Then he went on to look for other similar pairs: that is,twins who were separated at a very early age, and who had not seen each othersince. In their first few years of research they discovered thirty-four sets ofsuch twins. And again and again they discovered the same extraordinarycoincidences – coincidences that cannot be scientifically explained. Two Britishtwins, Margaret Richardson and Terry Connolly, who did not even know they weretwins until they were in their mid-thirties, had married on the same day withinan hour of each other. Two others, Dorothy Lowe and Bridget Harrison, haddecided to keep a diary for just one year, 1962, and had both filled in exactlythe same days. The diaries looked identical because they were of the same makeand colour. Both played the piano as children but gave it up in the same year.Both like eye-catching jewellery.Since then work on twins has continued to show that in many cases – particularlyof identical twins – there are incredible coincidences. Identical twins arethose who are formed by a splitting of the same ovum. They have identical genes,which means they have identical eyes, ears, limbs, even fingerprints. Thescientific term for such twins is monozygotic, or MZ for short. Dizygotic twins(DZ) are formed from two different eggs. The astonishing level of “coincidence”applies mainly to MZ twins. In fact, the similarities in many cases becomealmost monotonous. For example, the twins last mentioned, Bridget Harrison andDorothy Lowe, had sons called respectively Richard Andrew and Andrew Richard.Their daughters were called Katherine Louise and Karen Louise, but Dorothy Lowehad originally intended to call her daughter Katherine, and changed it to Karento please a relative. Both wear the same perfume. Both leave their bedroom doorsajar. Both had had meningitis. Both collect soft toys and had cats called Tiger.Bouchard’s intelligence tests showed they had identical IQs.Barbara Herbert and Daphne Goodship were the twins of an unmarried Finnishstudent, and were adopted by different families at birth. Both their adoptivemothers died when they were children. Both had fallen downstairs when they werefifteen and broken an ankle. Both met their future husbands at town-hall danceswhen they were sixteen, and married in their early twenties. Both had earlymiscarriages, then each had two boys followed by a girl. Both have a heartmurmur and a slightly enlarged thyroid. Both read the same popular novelists andtake the same women’s magazine. And when they met for the first time both hadtinted their hair the same shade of auburn, and were wearing beige dresses,brown velvet jackets and identical white petticoats.In 1979 Jeanette Hamilton and Irene Read each discovered they had twin sisters,and hastened to get together. They discovered that both suffered fromclaustrophobia and dislike of water, both sit with their backs to the sea onbeaches, both hated heights, both got a pain in the same spot in the right legin wet weather, and both are compulsive calculators. As children they had ledscout packs, and they had both worked at one time for the same cosmetics firm.Two male twins studied by Bouchard had been brought up in backgrounds that couldscarcely have been more different. Oscar Stohr and Jack Yufe were born inTrinidad in 1933, then their parents went off in opposite directions, eachtaking a twin. Oscar went to Germany and became a member of the Nazi youthmovement, while Jack was brought up as an orthodox Jew. They met for the firsttime at the airport in 1979, and found they were both wearing square,wire-rimmed glasses and blue shirts with epaulettes; they had identicalmoustaches. Closer study showed remarkable similarities in their habits. Bothflushed the lavatory before and after using it, stored rubber bands on theirwrists, and liked to eat alone in restaurants so they can read. Their speechrhythms were identical, although one spoke only German and the other onlyEnglish. Both had the same gait and the same way of sitting. Both had the samesense of humour – for example, a tendency to sneeze loudly in lifts to startlethe other passengers.It is obviously very difficult, if not impossible, to explain such a series of“coincidences” without positing some form of telepathy – that is, some form ofhidden connection between the twins – that persisted even when they wereseparated by long distances. In fact Jung, who invented the word “synchronicity”(see Chapter 54) for “meaningful coincidences”, would have accepted thetelepathic explanation: there are many anecdotes in his work that are designedto illustrate the reality of telepathy. But even telepathy cannot explain howtwo sisters met their husbands under similar circumstances or worked for thesame cosmetic firm; it must be either dismissed as coincidence or explained interms of some peculiar theory about “individual destinies”, or even whatProfessor Joad once called “the undoubted strangeness of time”. If people canhave glimpses of the future, or dream of events before they happen, it suggeststhat, in some odd way these events are already “programmed”, like a film thathas already been made. If individual lives are to some extent “pre-programmed”,then perhaps the lives of MZ twins have the same basic programming . . .Other cases certainly seem to demonstrate the reality of telepathy. In 1980 twofemale twins appeared in court in York, and attracted the attention of reportersbecause they made the same gestures at the same time, smiling simultaneously,raising their hands to their mouths at the same moment, and so on. The Chaplintwins, Freda and Greta, were in court for a peculiar reason: they had bothapparently developed a powerful “crush” on a lorry-driver, Mr Ken Iveson, whoused to live next door, and had been pursuing him for fifteen years. They seemto have had rather a curious way of showing affection, shouting abuse andhitting him with their handbags. When this had been going on for fifteen yearsMr Iveson decided to ask the court for protection.The publicity surrounding the court case led to various medical studies of thetwins. Their obsession with Mr Iveson was defined medically as erotomania, acondition in which a patient sinks into melancholy or mental disturbance due toromantic love. The twins proved to be mentally subnormal, although this seems tohave been a later development. At school they had been slow, but not backward,and teachers described them as neat, clean and quiet. The deputy headmasterplaced the blame on their mother. “It was quite clear that they had a dotingmother who never allowed them a seperate identity”. They were apparently dressedidentically and allowed no friends.The twins showed a tendency to the “mirror imaging” which is often typical of MZtwins. (That is to say, if one is left-handed, the other is right-handed; if thewhorls of the hair grow clockwise in one, they grow anti-clockwise in the other,and so on.) One twin wears a bracelet on the left wrist, the other on the right.When one broke a shoelace the other removed her own shoelace on the oppositeside.At some point the twins had been forced to leave home – neither they nor theirmother would disclose why. At thirty-seven they were unmarried and jobless; theylived in a local service hostel. They cooked breakfast in their room together,both holding the frying-pan, then went out in identical clothes. When they bothhad identical grey coats with different-coloured buttons they simply swappedhalf the buttons so each had both colours. When given different pairs of gloves,they took one of each pair. When given two different bars of soap, they cut bothin half and shared them. They told a woman journalist that they had one brain,and were really one person, claiming to know exactly what the other is thinking.Their “simultaneous behaviour” suggests that some form of telepathy existsbetween them. They occasionally quarrel, hitting one another lightly withidentical handbags, then sulking for hours. But in spite of these disagreements,it seems clear that their common aim is to exclude the external world and tolive in their own small private universe.Two Californian twins, Grace and Virginia Kennedy, even developed a privatelanguage in which they conversed; this started when they were seventeen monthsold. By 1977, when they were seven, a speech therapist in the San Diegochildren’s hospital began to study their private language, and discovered thatit seemed to be a mixture of invented words, like “nunukid” and “pulana”, and amixture of English and German words mispronounced (their parents wererespectively American and German). They called one another Poto and Cabenga, andspoke their unknown language swiftly and fluently. Eventually they were coaxedinto speaking English; but they declined to explain their former language – orperhaps they were simply unable to.One of the strangest cases involving twins was recorded in the New York Reviewof Books (28 Feb 1985) by the psychiatrist Oliver Sacks. Michael and John, knownsimply as The Twins, have been in state institutions since they were seven (in1947). They have been diagnosed as autistic, psychotic and severely retarded.Yet they possess one extraordinary ability: the ability to say on what day ofthe week any date in the past or future will fall; asked, say, about 11 June 55BC, they would instantly snap “Wednesday” – and prove correct. They are, saysSacks, a grotesque Tweedledum and Tweedledee, mirror-image twins who areidentical in face, personality and body movements, as well as in their brain andtissue damage. They wear glasses so thick that their eyes seem distorted.They can repeat any number of digits after one hearing – as many as threehundred. Yet they are not “calculating prodigies”, able to multiply huge numberswithin seconds or extract tenth roots from twenty digit numbers, as many suchprodigies have been able to. But when a box of matches fell on the floor, bothmurmured “111” before the matches hit the floor – and again, proved to becorrect.One day Sacks found them sitting in a corner, wearing an odd, contented smileand swopping six-digit numbers. He noted down several of these, and when he gothome, checked through a book of mathematical tables, and discovered that all thenumbers were primes – numbers that cannot be divided by any other number withouta “leftover”. Now, the odd thing is that there is no mathematical method ofdetermining whether some large number is a prime or not – except painstakinglyto try dividing all the smaller numbers into it; if it gives a “remainder” withevery smaller number up to half its own size, then it is a prime. Yet the twinswere apparently pulling primes out of the air without the slightest effort.The next day Sacks again sat in on their game, and suddenly interupted it withan eight-figure prime (taken from his book of tables). They looked at him inastonishment; then, after a half-minute pause their faces broke into broadsmiles. Then the twins began swopping nine-figure primes. Sacks offered aten-figure prime; once again there was wonderment. After a long silence Johnbrought out a twelve-figure number. Sacks had no way of checking this, becausehis book only went up to ten-figure primes; but he had no doubt it was a prime.An hour later the twins were swopping twenty-figure numbers.What were the twins doing during their half-minute silence when Sacks introducedthe eight-figure prime? The answer can only be that they were making the effortto see the number – to see it in some symmetrical way so they could see if therewas any “remainder”. Most of us can visualize, say, nine or sixteen by imagininga group of dots laid out in three rows of three or four rows of four; the twinsmust have been doing the same thing on a far vaster scale.This offers us an important clue. We know that the two hemispheres of the brainhave different functions: in effect, the left is a scientist, the right anartist. The left is concerned with language and logic; the right with intuitionsand insights. The left sees the world from a “worm’s-eye view”, the right from a“bird’s-eye view”. In civilized human beings the left is the “dominanthemisphere”, and my sense of identity resides there, so that when I use the word“I” it is the left brain speaking. (See also article on synchronicity.) In mostof us the powers of the right brain – to visualize patterns, for example – arefairly limited compared to the reasoning powers of the left. It seems clear thatin the Twins the powers of the left are extremely limited, but the powers of theright are apparently hundreds of times greater than in the rest of us.It would seem that the general lesson to be learned from twins is that thenon-stop left-brain activity demanded by civilization has suppressed all kindsof “natural” powers in the right, such as telepathic communication, physicalempathy, and the ability to grasp reality with a “bird’s-eye vision” – with a“telescope” instead of the microscope we habitually use. And cases like those ofthe Jim twins – in which the same kind of things have happened to twins who havebeen separated since birth – seem to hint there are laws and patterns of eventsscientists and philosophers have not even begun to suspect."},{"pageContent":"27 Jack the RipperShedding New Light on the World’s Most Infamous Serial KillerIn spite of the epidemic of twentieth-century serial killers with sobriquetslike the Boston Strangler, the Buffalo Slasher, and the Sunset Slayer, Jack theRipper still remains far and away the world’s most famous – or infamous – serialkiller. This is not due simply to the grisly picturesqueness of the nickname butto the fact that the murders took place in the fog-shrouded London of SherlockHolmes and that – unlike the three killers mentioned above – the identity ofJack the Ripper is still a total mystery.One other interesting fact deserves to be taken into account: Jack the Ripperwas the first sex killer in the modern sense of the term. The notion that sexcrimes made their first appearance as late as 1888 sounds rather strange. Whatabout Roman emperors like Tiberius, who enjoyed deflowering altar boys? Whatabout Gilles de Rais and Vlad the Impaler and Ivan the Terrible? The first thingwe notice about these men is that they were all rulers or members of thearistocracy. They had leisure – which can also lead to boredom – and sufficientauthority to be able to impose their will on their victims. But the majority ofcriminals throughout history have killed or robbed for purely economic reasons.The Newgate Calendar, a compilation of crimes published in London in the lateeighteenth century, contains only half a dozen “sex crimes”, and these were notviolent rapes but what we would call seductions. The lower classes were toohungry to bother about “forbidden” sex, and the upper classes could obtain it soeasily that rape would have been pointless.In the early nineteenth century a significant development occurred; the rise ofpornography. The man most responsible for this was the Marquis de Sade – againan aristocrat – who died in an asylum in 1816. He was very highly sexed, andsince he spent most of his life in prison, he had little to do but fantasizeabout sex. His books, with their monstrous daydreams of rape and torture,inspired many imitators in the 1820s, not all of whom shared his taste forflogging and being flogged, but every one of whom was excited by the notion ofthe forbidden.In the two decades preceding Jack the Ripper, there were a few crimes that wewould nowadays describe as sex murders, but these were usually perpetrated bypeople who would today be committed to an asylum – like the Italian youthVincent Verzeni, who graduated from killing chickens to disemboweling women and“sucking their blood”, or the Boston teenager Jesse Pomeroy, who enjoyedinflicting pain on younger children and ended by killing two of them.Compared to these, there was something utterly calculated about the Jack theRipper murders, which took place in the Whitechapel area of East London, in theautumn of 1888, and which produced a morbid sense of shock and panic.It was still dark on the morning of September 1 when a cart driver named GeorgeCross walked along Bucks Row on his way to work. It was a narrow, cobbled streetwith the blank wall of a warehouse on one side and a row of terraced houses onthe other. In the dim light Cross saw what he thought was a bundle of tarpaulinand went to investigate. It proved to be a woman lying on her back, her skirtabove her waist. Cross decided she was drunk, and when another man approached,he said, “Give me a hand getting this woman on her feet”. The other man, amarket porter, looked down dubiously; his first impression was that she had beenraped and left for dead. He bent down and touched her cheek, which was cold, andher hand. “She’s dead”, he said. “We’d better find a policeman”. He pulled downher skirt to make her decent.In fact, the beat of Police Constable John Neil took him through Bucks Row, anda few minutes after the men had left, the light of his bull’s-eye lantern showedhim the woman’s body, which lay close to a stable door. It also showed himsomething the men had been unable to see: that the woman’s throat had been cutso deeply that the vertebrae were exposed.An hour later the body, which was that of a middle-aged woman, lay in the yardof the local mortuary, and two paupers from the workhouse next door were giventhe job of stripping it, while a police inspector took notes. It was when theypulled off the two petticoats that the inspector saw that the woman’s abdomenhad been slashed open with a jagged incision that ran from the bottom of theribs to the pelvis.The woman was identified through a Lambeth Workhouse mark stenciled on herpetticoat. She was Mary Ann Nicholls, a prostitute who had been living at acommon lodging house in Thrawl Street – one of the worst slums even in thatpoverty-stricken area. A few hours before her death she had staggered back tothe lodging house, her speech slurred with drink, and admitted that she lackedthe fourpence necessary for a bed. The keeper had turned her away. “I’ll soonget the money”, she had shouted as she went off down the street. “See what ajolly bonnet I’ve got”. She went looking for a man who would give her the priceof a bed in exchange for an uncomfortable act of intercourse on the pavement ina back alley. What had happened, the police surgeon inferred, was that hercustomer had placed his hands around her throat as she lay on the ground andstrangled her into unconsciousness – there were bruises on her throat. Then hehad cut her throat with two powerful slashes that had almost severed the head,raised her skirt, and stabbed and slashed at her stomach in a kind of frenzy.Oddly enough, the murder caused little sensation. Prostitutes were often killedin the slums of London, sometimes by gangs who demanded protection money. Theprevious April a prostitute named Emma Smith had dragged herself into LondonHospital, reporting that she had been attacked by four men in Osborn Street.They had rammed some object, possibly an iron bar, into her vagina with suchforce that it had penetrated the uterus; she had died of peritonitis. In Julydismembered portions of a woman’s body had been recovered from the Thames. Andon 7 August 1888, a prostitute named Martha Tabram had been found dead on alanding in George Yards Buildings, Whitechapel; she had been stabbed thirty-ninetimes with a knife or bayonet. Two soldiers were questioned about her murder butproved to have an excellent alibi. Evidently some sadistic brute had a grudgeagainst prostitutes, it was hardly the kind of story to appeal to respectablenewspaper readers.That attitude was to change dramatically eight days after the murder of Mary AnnNicholls, when another disemboweled body was found in the backyard of a barber’sshop in Hanbury Street, Whitechapel. It was a place where prostitutes often tooktheir customers, and this is evidently what Annie Chapman had done at about 5:30on the morning of Saturday, 8 September 1888; a neighbour had seen her talkingto a dark-looking man “of foreign appearance”, dressed in shabby genteel clothesand wearing a deerstalker hat. Half an hour later a lodger named John Davis wentdownstairs and into the yard, where the lavatory was situated. He saw the bodyof a woman lying against the fence, her skirt drawn up above her waist and herlegs bent at the knees. The stomach had been cut open and some of the intestinespulled out. As in the case of Mary Ann Nicholls, the cause of death was a deepgash in the throat. The murderer had placed the woman’s rings and some penniesat her feet and a torn envelope near her head. Medical examination revealed thatthe killer had also removed the uterus and upper part of the vagina.Now, suddenly, the press awoke to the fact that the unknown killer was asadistic maniac. The Star that afternoon carried the headline: “Latest HorribleMurder in Whitechapel”. When Mrs Mary Burridge, of Blackfriars Road, SouthLondon, read the story, she collapsed and died “of a fit”. Sir MelvilleMacnaghten, later head of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), wouldeventually write in his memoirs: “No one who was living in London that autumnwill forget the terror created by these murders. Even now I can recall the foggyevenings, and hear again the raucous cries of the newspaper boys: ‘Anotherhorrible murder, murder, mutilation, Whitechapel.’”In our own age of mass violence, we find it impossible to imagine the shockcreated by the murders. A journalist who reported the crimes later began hisaccount of them in a popular booklet: “In the long catalogue of crimes which hasbeen compiled in our modern days there is nothing to be found, perhaps, whichhas so darkened the horizon of humanity and shadowed the vista of man’s betternature as the series of mysterious murders committed in Whitechapel during thelatter part of 1888”. “Shadowed the vista of man’s better nature” – this is whatso frightened Londoners. It was as if an inhuman monster, a kind of demon, hadstarted to hunt the streets. Hysteria swept over the whole country. There hadbeen nothing like it since the Ratcliffe Highway murders of 1811, when twofamilies were slaughtered in East London, and householders all over Englandbarricaded their doors at night.On 29 September 1888, the Central News Agency received a letter that began:“Dear Boss, I keep on hearing the police have caught me but they won’t fix mejust yet”. It included the sentence; “I am down on whores and I shan’t quitripping them till I do get buckled” and promised: “You will soon hear of me withmy funny little games”. It was signed “Jack the Ripper” – the first time thename had been used. The writer requested: “Keep this letter back till I do a bitmore work, then give it out straight”. The Central News Agency decided to followhis advice.That night, a Saturday, the “ripper” killed again – this time not one, but twoprostitutes. At 1:00 A.M. on Sunday morning a hawker named Louis Diemschutzdrove his pony and cart into the backyard of a workingman’s club in BernerStreet. The pony shied and Diemschutz saw something lying in front of its feet;a closer look showed him that it was a woman’s body. The Ripper was either inthe yard at that moment or had only just left it when he heard the approach ofthe horse and cart. When Diemschutz returned a few moments later with a lightedcandle, he was able to see that the woman’s throat had been cut. There had alsobeen an attempt to cut off her ear. She was later identified as ElizabethStride, an alcoholic Swedish prostitute.The killer had been interrupted but his nerve was unshaken. He hastened upBerner Street and along Commercial Road – this murder had been farther afieldthan the others – and reached the Houndsditch area just in time to meet aprostitute who had been released from Bishopsgate police station ten minutesearlier. Her name was Catherine Eddowes, and she had been held for being drunkand disorderly. He seems to have had no difficulty persuading the woman toaccompany him into Mitre Square, a small square surrounded by warehouses, only afew hundred yards away. A policeman patrolled the square every fifteen minutesor so, and when he passed through at 1:30, he saw nothing unusual. At 1:45 hefound the body of a woman lying in the corner of the square. She was lying onher back, with her dress pushed up around her waist, and her face had beenslashed. Her body had been gashed open from the base of the ribs to the pubicregion, and the throat had been cut. Later examination revealed that a kidneywas missing and that half of one ear had been cut off.The murderer had evidently heard the approach of the policeman and hurriedlyleft the square by a small passage that runs from its northern side. In thispassage there was a communal sink, and he had paused long enough to wash theblood from his hands and probably from his knife. In Goulston Street, aten-minute walk away, he discarded a bloodstained piece of his victim’s apron.The policeman who found it also found a chalked message scrawled on a nearbywall: “The Juwes are not the men that will be blamed for nothing”. The policecommissioner, Sir Charles Warren, ordered the words to be rubbed out, in spiteof a plea from a local CID man that they should be photographed first; hethought they might cause a riot against the Jews, thousands of whom lived inWhitechapel.Macnaghten admitted later: “When the double murder of 30th September took place,the exasperation of the public at the non-discovery of the perpetrator knew nobounds”. The “Jack the Ripper” letter was released, and the murderer immediatelyacquired a nickname. And early on Monday morning the Central News Agencyreceived another missive – this time a postcard – from Jack the Ripper. It read:“I was not codding [joking] dear old boss when I gave you the tip. You’ll hearabout Saucy Jack’s work tomorrow. Double event this time. Number one squealed abit. Couldn’t finish straight off. Had not time to get ears for police. Thanksfor keeping last letter back till I got to work again”.The public exploded in fury. Meetings were held in the streets, criticizing thepolice. Sir Charles Warren’s resignation was demanded. Because the murderer wassuspected of being a doctor, men carrying black bags found it dangerous to walkthrough the streets. The police decided to try bloodhounds, but the dogspromptly lost themselves on Tooting Common.Yet as October passed with no further murders, the panic began to die down.Then, in the early hours of 9 November the Ripper staged his most spectacularcrime of all. Mary Jeanette Kelly was a young Irishwoman, only twenty-four yearsold, who lived in a cheap room in Miller’s Court, off Dorset Street. At abouttwo o’clock that morning she was seen talking to a swarthy man with a heavymoustache; he seemed well dressed and had a gold watch chain. They entered thenarrow alleyway that led to her lodging: room 13.At 10:45 the next morning a rent collector knocked on her door but received noreply. He put his hand through a broken pane of glass in the window and pulledaside the curtain. What he saw sent him rushing for a policeman.Jack the Ripper had surpassed himself. The body lay on the bed, and themutilations must have taken a long time – an hour or more. One of the hands layin the open stomach. The head had been virtually removed and was hanging on onlyby a piece of skin, as was the left arm. The breasts and nose had been removedand the skin from the legs stripped off. The heart lay on the pillow, and someof the intestines were draped around a picture. The remains of a fire burned inthe grate, as if the Ripper had used it to provide himself with light. But thistime, medical examination revealed that the Ripper had taken away none of theinternal organs; his lengthy exercise in mutilation had apparently satisfied hispeculiar sadistic fever.This murder caused the greatest sensation of all. The police chief finallyresigned. Public clamour became louder than ever; even Queen Victoria madesuggestions on how to catch the murderer. Yet the slaughter of Mary Kelly provedto be the last of the crimes of Jack the Ripper. The police, hardly able tobelieve their luck as weeks and months went by without further atrocities,reached the conclusion that the Ripper had either committed suicide or beenconfined in a mental home. A body taken from the river early the followingJanuary was identified as that of a doctor who had committed suicide, andScotland Yard detectives told themselves that this was almost certainly Jack theRipper. But their claims have never been confirmed.There have, of course, been many fascinating theories. Forty years after themurders, an Australian journalist named Leonard Matters wrote the firstfull-length book on Jack the Ripper. He ended by telling an extraordinary story:how a surgeon in Buenos Aires was called to the bedside of a dying Englishman,whom he recognized as the brilliant surgeon Dr Stanley, under whom he hadstudied. Stanley told him a horrifying story. In 1888 his son Herbert had diedof syphilis contracted from a prostitute two years before; her name had beenMary Jeanette Kelly. Dr Stanley swore to avenge Herbert’s death and prowled theEast End of London looking for the woman. He would pick up prostitutes, questionthem about Mary Kelly, then kill them to make sure they made no attempt to warnher. Finally, he found the woman he was seeking and took his revenge. Then heleft for Argentina.Matters admitted that his own search of the records of the British MedicalAssociation had revealed no Dr Stanley nor anyone who even resembled him. Butthere are other reasons for regarding the Stanley story as fiction. If DrStanley was only trying to silence his first four or five victims, why did hedisembowel them? In any case, syphilis is unlikely to kill a man in two years –ten is a more likely period. But the most conclusive piece of evidence againstthe Dr Stanley theory is that Mary Kelly was not suffering from syphilis.Ten years later an artist named William Stewart published Jack the Ripper: A NewTheory. Stewart had studied the inquest report on Mary Kelly and discovered thatshe was pregnant at the time of her death. He produced the remarkable theorythat Jack the Ripper was a woman – a midwife who had gone to the room inMiller’s Court to perform an abortion. After killing Mary Kelly in a sadisticfrenzy, she had dressed up in her spare clothes and left, after burning her ownbloody garments in the grate. The immediate objection to this theory is thatMary Kelly had no spare clothes – she was too poor. But the major objection isthat there has never yet been a case of sadistic mutilation murder in which thekiller was a woman. Stewart’s “Jill the Ripper” is a psychologicalimprobability.In 1959 the journalist Donald McCormick revived a theory that dated to the1920s. A journalist named William LeQueux described in a book called Things IKnow how, after the Russian revolution, the Kerensky government had allowed himto see a manuscript written in French by the “mad monk” Rasputin and found in asafe in the basement of Rasputin’s house. It was called Great Russian Criminals,and it declared that Jack the Ripper was a sadistic maniac named AlexanderPedachenko, who was sent to England by the Russian secret police to embarrassthe British police force. Pedachenko, said LeQueux, was later arrested after hetried to kill a woman in Tver (Kalinin). In fact, LeQueux wrote three booksabout Rasputin, all full of cynical invention. And although they were writtenbefore Things I Know, they all fail to mention this extraordinary theory. Butthe strongest objection to the Rasputin-Pedachenko theory is that Rasputin didnot speak a word of French and that he lived in a flat on the third floor, in ahouse with no cellar.In the same year that McCormick’s book was published, Daniel Farson investigatedthe Ripper murders for a television program and succeeded in securing anextraordinary scoop. Sir Melville Macnaghten had hinted strongly in his memoirsthat he knew the identity of Jack the Ripper and spoke of three suspects,although he finally dismissed two of these. Farson succeeded in getting hold ofMacnaghten’s original notes and learned the name of this chief suspect: anunsuccessful barrister named Montague John Druitt – the man whose body was foundin the Thames in early January 1889. Farson did some remarkable detective workand learned a great deal about Druitt’s life and death.Alas, when Macnaghten’s comments are examined closely, it becomes very clearthat he knew little or nothing about Druitt. He calls him a doctor when he was abarrister. He says he believes Druitt lived with his family, when in fact helived in chambers, like most lawyers. He says he believes Druitt’s mind snappedafter his “glut” in Miller’s Court and that he committed suicide the followingday. We know that Druitt killed himself three weeks later and that he did sobecause he was depressed after going to see his mother, who had become insane –he was afraid that the same thing was happening to him. In fact, Macnaghtenjoined the police force six months after the Ripper murders came to an end, andit is obvious that his Druitt theory was pure wishful thinking, without a shredof supporting evidence.When, in 1960, I published a series of articles entitled “My Search for Jack theRipper” in the London Evening Standard, I was asked to lunch by an old surgeonnamed Thomas Stowell, who told me his own astonishing theory about the Ripper’sidentity: that it was Queen Victoria’s grandson – the heir to the throne – theDuke of Clarence, who died during the flu epidemic in 1892. Sowell told me thathe had seen the private papers of Sir William Gull, Queen Victoria’s physician,and that Gull had dropped mysterious hints about Clarence and Jack the Ripper,as well as mentioning that Clarence had syphilis, from which he died. When,subsequently, I asked Stowell if I could write about his theory, he said no. “Itmight upset Her Majesty”. But in 1970 he decided to publish it himself in amagazine called The Criminologist. Admittedly, he did not name his suspect – hecalled him S – but he dropped dozens of hints that it was Clarence. Journaliststook up the story and it caused a worldwide sensation. Stowell was so shaken byall the publicity that he died a week later, trying to repair the damage byclaiming that his suspect was not the Duke of Clarence.A writer named Michael Harrison, working on a biography of Clarence, carefullyreread Stowell’s article and realized that there were many discrepancies betweenthe career of S and that of the Duke of Clarence. He concluded that Sir WilliamGull had indeed referred to a suspect as S but that it was not the Duke ofClarence, but someone who was closely acquainted with him. Studying Clarence’sacquaintances, he discovered the ideal suspect: James Kenneth Stephen, a poet,lawyer, and man-about-town who had become distinctly odd after being struck onthe head by the vane of a windmill and who, like Clarence, had died – in amental home – in 1892. Harrison had no trouble in disposing of Clarence as asuspect, pointing out that at the time of the Miller’s Court murder, Clarencewas celebrating his father’s birthday at Sandringham. But he was far lesssuccessful in finding even a grain of evidence to connect Stephen with thecrimes. It is almost impossible to imagine the intellectual young aesthete,author of a great deal of published verse, stalking prostitutes with a knife.The next major book on Jack the Ripper was optimistically entitled Jack theRipper: The Final Solution (1976) and was written by a young journalist namedStephen Knight; he was following up a story propounded in a BBC televisionseries called “The Ripper File”, which in turn was based on an astounding storytold by Joseph “Hobo” Sickert, son of the famous Victorian painter WalterSickert. This story also involved the Duke of Clarence – although not, thistime, as the murderer.According to Hobo Sickert, his father and the heir to the throne were closefriends, and the Duke often went slumming with the bohemian painter. InSickert’s studio in Cleveland Street, Soho, Clarence met an attractive youngartist’s model named Annie Crook. She became his mistress and in 1885 gave birthto a baby girl they named Alice Margaret. Then, according to Sickert, Clarenceand his mistress got married in a private ceremony.The story becomes more preposterous. When the secret marriage reached the ear ofQueen Victoria, she was horrified. Annie was not only a commoner but a Catholic.The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, gave orders that Annie and the baby were tobe kidnapped. A carriage drove up to the house at 6 Cleveland Street, and Annieand her baby daughter were hustled into a carriage and taken off to a mentalhome; there Sir William Gull performed a sinister brain operation on Annie tomake her lose her memory. (This, incidentally, is virtually impossible; evennowadays scientists are uncertain where the source of memory lies, and in 1888ignorance was total.)The child, Alice, was handed over to a nanny in the East End of London – oneMary Kelly. Eventually, Alice found her way back to Walter Sickert and becamehis mistress. Joseph “Hobo” Sickert was the outcome of this union.But Mary Kelly made the mistake of deciding to blackmail the royal family. Shehad taken a number of fellow prostitutes into her confidence, and the PrimeMinister decided they all had to be killed. The task was given to Sir WilliamGull, who had sadistic tendencies anyway. His method was complicated butoriginal; he would drive around the streets of Whitechapel in a coach until hesaw his prospective victim, who would then be lured inside and disemboweled. Hiscoachman, a man named Netley, was an accomplice. (A more recent theory suggeststhat Netley himself was Jack the Ripper.) And since Gull was also a Freemason,he left various clues in the form of hints of masonic ritual, such as theobjects arranged so carefully around Annie Chapman and the misspelling of Jewsas Juwes. Mary Kelly, of course, was the final victim.It is not clear whether Knight believed this incredible farrago of nonsense. Heprobably did not. He knew that Gull had suffered a stroke in 1887 and would havebeen incapable of the murders. And a fellow investigator named Simon Wood haduncovered Annie Crook’s rent book and discovered that she left the ClevelandStreet address in 1886, a year before she is supposed to have been kidnapped.Moreover, the records show that she was living a perfectly normal life until1920, when she died in a workhouse. Her religion was Church of England, notRoman Catholic. Simon Wood told Knight all of this soon after publication of TheFinal Solution, but Knight made no attempt to correct his “facts” in thepaperback edition. Since his book had become something of a bestseller, it wasnot in his interests to admit that he had been deceived by Hobo Sickert.It was, in fact, Hobo Sickert himself who pulled the rug out from under Knightby publicly admitting that the Jack the Ripper part of his story was pureinvention. He insisted, however, that the story of Annie Crook giving birth tothe Duke of Clarence’s daughter – and the daughter becoming his own mother – wastrue. And in this he was probably being truthful. The most convincing part ofKnight’s book is his description of the various “clues” to the affair thatSickert slipped into his paintings.In fact, this part of the story was confirmed – or at least strongly supported –in a book entitled Sickert and the Ripper Crimes (1990) by Jean Overton Fuller.It also demonstrates that Hobo Sickert did not invent his Jack the Ripper storyout of whole cloth; it looks as if a remarkable coincidence led him to believethat there was some connection between the Duke of Clarence and the Rippermurders.Jean Overton Fuller’s mother had a friend named Florence Pash, an artist who wasalso an intimate of Walter Sickert. Florence had told Mrs Fuller that Sickertknew the identity of Jack the Ripper and that he had carried some sinistersecret around with him for the rest of his days – a secret that, at times, madehim fear for his life. Florence Pash also confirmed that Mary Kelly had workedfor Sickert as a nursemaid before the murders. We know that Sickert was obsessedby the Ripper murders and that he painted several pictures based on them.All this, according to Jean Fuller, proves that Sickert was himself Jack theRipper and that his motive was to kill the blackmailing prostitutes who knew thesecret of Annie Crook.This is obviously absurd. Why should Sickert go around murdering prostitutesbecause they knew that the Duke of Clarence had fathered an illegitimate child?Protecting his royal friend’s good name is obviously an insufficient motive.Besides, Jack the Ripper was a sadist who enjoyed disemboweling women. WalterSickert seems to have been one of the nastiest and most spoiled men who everlived, but as far as we know, he was not a sadist.What the Florence Pash evidence does seem to prove is that the Duke reallyfathered an illegitimate daughter, who became the mother of Joseph Sickert. Italso confirms the unlikeliest part of Hobo Sickert’s story: that Mary Kellyacted as a nursemaid to the baby. She may even have tried to blackmail Sickert.But even without the blackmail motif, we can understand why Sickert thought hewas the custodian of a frightening secret. When Mary Kelly became – almostcertainly by pure chance – the Ripper’s final victim, he must have felt certainthat the long arm of Buckingham Palace was involved. And when Hobo Sickert, thechild of Walter Sickert and Annie Crook, came to hear of this tale of a royallove affair followed by murder, he understandably came to believe that thePalace was somehow involved in the murders. At least Fuller’s book enables us tounderstand how the whole silly story came to be invented.But that leaves us with the question: Who was the Ripper? In 1988, the centenaryof the murders, half a dozen books propounded new theories – or old theorieswith a new twist.Martin Fido’s Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper returned toMacnaghten’s original notes, which listed three men as the chief Rippersuspects: Druitt (whom we have already dismissed), an insane Russian doctornamed Ostrog (the origin of “Pedachenko”), and an insane Polish Jew namedKosminski, who was committed to an asylum in 1889. Sir Robert Anderson, theAssistant Commissioner of Police, is on record as remarking that the Ripper wasa Polish Jew. Fido looked through the records of insane asylums and found a mannamed Aaron Kozminski, who died in 1891; but he was suffering from paranoiddelusions and obviously lacked the cunning and intelligence to be the Ripper. Afurther search, however, uncovered a Nathan Kaminsky, treated for syphilis inMarch 1888, but about whom nothing more is known. Fido identifies him with DavidCohen, another Polish Jew, who was committed to an asylum in December 1888 anddied in the following year; Cohen was too violent to associate with his fellowpatients. Fido speculates that a man who mumbled his name as “Nathan Kamin”might have been misheard as saying “David Cohen”. This is true; it is also truethat Cohen might have been Jack the Ripper. But there is not a shred of realevidence that he was.Paul Begg, another “Ripperologist”, points out in Jack the Ripper: UncensoredFacts that a close associate of Anderson, D. S. Swanson, wrote in the margin ofAnderson’s autobiography the comment that the Polish Jew died in “the SeasideHome”. This would seem to rule out Kaminsky-Cohen as the Ripper.In The Ripper Legacy, Martin Howells and Keith Skinner describe their fruitlessinvestigation into an “Australian connection” mentioned by Daniel Farson: thenotion that Druitt’s cousin Lionel moved to Australia and wrote a pamphletentitled “Jack the Ripper – I Knew Him”. This trail led nowhere. Nevertheless,Howells and Skinner endorse Farson’s conclusion that Druitt was Jack the Ripperand suggest that his “suicide” in the Thames was actually murder – that formerassociates from his Cambridge days, a society called The Apostles, learned thathe was the Ripper and killed him in order to prevent a scandal. The book revealstheir remarkable tenacity as researchers, but their theory contains as many“ifs” as Martin Fido’s.The “black magician” Aleister Crowley was convinced that the Ripper was another“magician” by the name of Roslyn D’Onston Stevenson (who preferred to be called“D’Onston”), who committed the murders as part of a ritual to gain suprememagical powers. Crowley tells a preposterous story about how D’Onston ate partsof the bodies at the scene of the crime and in so doing stained his ties withblood. The bloodstained ties were then found in a tin box under D’Onston’s bedby his lesbian landlady.In fact, D’Onston wrote a letter to Scotland Yard claiming to know the identityof Jack the Ripper: a doctor named Morgan Davies. His grounds for this beliefwere that he had heard Davies describing the murders to some fellow doctors andenacting the crimes with a gruesome realism that convinced D’Onston that Davieshad actually committed them. The police seem to have treated it as yet anothercrank letter. In A Casebook on Jack the Ripper (1976), criminologist RichardWhittington-Egan went into the D’Onston theory at length but concluded thatD’Onston was a fantasist and something of a con man.Whittington-Egan’s friend Melvin Harris decided to investigate D’Onston anddiscovered that Whittington-Egan had been less than just. Many of D’Onston’s“fantasies” about his service in India and fighting under Garibaldi turned outto be true. Harris’s Jack the Ripper: The Bloody Truth is an impressive piece ofresearch. But it utterly fails to explain why a man who went to the policealleging that someone else was Jack the Ripper (on grounds that cannot be takenseriously) should himself have been the Whitechapel murderer.Another brilliant piece of investigation was carried out by a Norwich accountantnamed Steward Hicks, who searched through the lunacy records for 1888 and cameupon the name of a doctor named John Hewitt, who had been a patient in CotonHill, an asylum in Staffordshire. Walter Sickert once described how he had takena room near Camden Town and how his landlady was convinced that one of herprevious lodgers, a student vet named John Hewitt, was Jack the Ripper – Hewitthad burned all his clothes in the grate (presumably to destroy bloodstains) andoften stayed out all night. Hewitt’s mother had finally removed him toBournemouth, where he died of tuberculosis.Could it be, wondered Hicks, that Hewitt’s mother had actually realized he wasJack the Ripper and had had him committed to an asylum in Staffordshire? Hisresearch revealed that Hewitt had died of “general paralysis of the insane” in1892, so he could be the Ripper. Hicks approached me with his theory, and I wasable to help him gain access to the records of Coton Hill asylum, which had nowbeen removed to the Staffordshire asylum. Alas, they revealed that Hewitt hadcommitted himself to the asylum before the murders began. There was, however,still a slim hope for Mr Hicks’s theory. Since Hewitt had committed himselfvoluntarily to the asylum, he was allowed to go in and out as he pleased. If hehad been away on the dates of the Whitechapel murders, that would constitutealmost overwhelming circumstantial evidence that he was the Ripper. Regrettably,when Hicks finally gained full access to the papers in the Public RecordsOffice, they made it clear that the dates when Hewitt was absent from the asylumwere not the dates of the murders. Hicks tells me that, in spite of this, hestill believes he may find evidence to show that Hewitt could have been Jack theRipper. I wish him luck but cannot share his optimism.Other theories that surfaced around the time of the Ripper centenary are thatthe killer was Frank Miles, a homosexual artist who was a friend of OscarWilde’s (and who died insane), and that he was Joseph Barnett, the man who hadlived with Mary Kelly until shortly before her murder. The Frank Miles theory –advocated by Mr Thomas Toughill – is open to the same objection as Harrison’sStephen theory: that highly educated, “aesthetic” young poets (or artists) arenot likely to turn to disemboweling. Bruce Paley, author of the Joseph Barnetttheory, has a stronger case, in that whoever killed Mary Kelly locked the doorbehind him – yet the key is known to have been missing for some time. Barnettcould easily have had the key. On the other hand, it may simply have turned upagain before Mary Kelly was killed. And since Barnett is known to have been amild little man, the theory that he killed five women because he was madly inlove with Mary and disapproved of her habit of selling her favours is, to saythe least, unlikely.Jack the Ripper: Summing Up and Verdict, by myself and Robin Odell, alsoappeared during the centenary. In Jack the Ripper in Fact and Fiction (1965),Robin Odell had suggested that Jack the Ripper was a Jewish shochet, or ritualslaughterer, whose sadistic tendencies were stimulated by his profession untilhe began killing women. This is conceivable – except that it is hard to see whya sadist whose job involved slaughtering cattle by cutting their throats shouldhave felt the need to kill women. And since all the records that might haveenabled Odell to identify his slaughterer were destroyed during the Second WorldWar, it seems that we must regard his theory as one more interestingmight-have-been.Since the early 1980s the phenomenon of serial murder has seized the publicimagination, and careful psychological studies – particularly by the FBI’sBehavioral Science Unit at Quantico, Virginia – have thrown some important newlight on the phenomenon.13[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2236488] What can theytell us about Jack the Ripper? To begin with, the great majority of serialkillers have emerged from working-class backgrounds. The middle- or upper-classserial killer is virtually unknown – presumably because the kind of frustrationsthat lead to multiple murder tend to spring from childhood poverty and illtreatment. This means that we can fairly confidently dismiss all the theoriesthat involve an upper-class Ripper (or even a middle-class doctor like Matters’sDr Stanley or D’Onston’s Morgan Davies).We must also recognize that part of the fascination of the Ripper murders liesin the mistaken notion that the murderer must have been a master criminal, akind of Dracula who preferred to mutilate his victims rather than drink theirblood. In fact, the surprising thing about most serial killers is that they tendto be ordinary, nondescript individuals. In many cases, they seem so gentle andpolite that their acquaintances find it impossible to believe they were capableof murder. The Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo, falls into this category; sodoes Peter Kürten, the Düsseldorf sadist, and Earl Nelson, the Gorilla Murderer– a charming young man who liked to discuss the Bible.In many cases, the killer himself is totally unable to understand the urges thatdrive him to kill, and criminologists admit to being equally baffled. InSeptember 1980 four black men were shot with a .22 rifle in Buffalo and NiagaraFalls; in October two black cab drivers were stabbed to death and their heartscut out. The killer had opened the ribcages and seemed to possess some medicalskill. In December 1980 four black men were stabbed to death in New York by aman who simply approached them in the street.The following January an eighteen-year-old army private named Joseph C.Christopher – a white – attacked a black soldier with a potato knife and thentried to emasculate himself. In custody, Christopher confessed to being the“Buffalo Slasher” as well as the .22 killer and the knife-wielding maniac of NewYork. People who had known Christopher in Buffalo were astounded; he was aquiet, ordinary teenager who was not known as a racist or a homosexual. (All thevictims were male.) He had been raised in an Italian neighbourhood by a dominantfather and a passive mother – in that respect he resembled the Boston Strangler– and had adored his father, who had taught him to shoot. Christopher had beenmuch affected by his father’s death, which had occurred in 1976, when he wasfourteen. He himself seemed to have no idea of why he had killed. As a“monster”, Joe Christopher is a total disappointment. Yet he provides us with amore realistic image of the serial killer than the notion of a raving maniac.The probability is that Jack the Ripper was as “ordinary” and as nondescript asChristopher. He was probably not even insane, like “Pedachenko”, or violent,like Kaminsky-Cohen. So there is almost certainly no hope of establishing hisidentity more than a century after the murders. He was a “nobody”.Yet, oddly enough, there is a suspect who fits this description of a “murderousnobody”. After Daniel Farson had presented his television program on Jack theRipper in 1959, he received a letter from a man who signed himself G.W.B. andwho explained that he was a seventy-seven-year-old who lived in Melbourne,Australia. He wrote:> When I was a nipper, about 1889, I was playing in the streets about 9.00 P.M.> when my mother called, “Come in Georgie or JTR [Jack the Ripper] will get> you”. That night a man patted me on the head and said, “Don’t worry, Georgie.> You would be the last person JTR would touch”. [This man was apparently> Georgie’s own father, who was born in 1850 and so would have been thirty-eight> at the time of the murders.] My father was a terrible drunkard and night after> night he would come home and kick my mother and us kids about something> cruelly. About the year 1902 I was taught boxing, and after feeling proficient> to hold my own, I threatened my father that if he laid a hand on my mother or> brothers I would thrash him. He never did after that, but we lived in the same> house and never spoke to each other. Later, I emigrated to Australia. I was> booked to depart with three days’ notice, and my mother asked me to say> goodbye to my father. It was then he told his foul history and why he did> those terrible murders, and advised me to change my name because he would> confess before he died. Once settled in Melbourne I assumed another name.> However, my father died in 1912 and I was watching the papers carefully,> expecting a sensational announcement.> > This, of course, never came. Georgie’s explanation for his father’s heavydrinking is that he had always wanted a daughter but that his first child – afemale – was an imbecile; later children were all boys. “During the confessionof those awful murders, he explained that he did not know what he was doing buthis ambition was to get drunk and an urge to kill every prostitute that accostedhim”.His father, Georgie explained, was a dung collector, and on one occasion, afterkilling a woman, he had removed his outer pair of trousers, which were saturatedwith blood, and hidden them in the manure. Later, while his partner went to havea meal of sausage and mash, Jack (this was the father’s name) buried himself inthe manure to keep warm and upon hearing a policeman asking questions about Jackthe Ripper felt “scared to death”.Many sadistic killers commit their crimes only after they have been drinkingheavily, and “Georgie’s” account of his father rings psychologically true. Ahighly dominant individual, a bully who beat his wife and probably felt acontempt for all women, might well have experienced a kind of homicidal ragewhen accosted by prostitutes. It is also hard to imagine why aseventy-seven-year-old man should bother to write an anonymous letter fromMelbourne with a completely false story. And, assuming his story to be true, itis equally hard to see why his father should have invented the story about beingJack the Ripper.It is possible that, even at this distance in time, a check of the records ofships bound for Australia in 1902 could reveal the identity of “G.W.B”. and thatthis in turn might lead to uncovering the identity of a man called Jack (surnameprobably beginning with a B) who was born in 1850, died in 1912, and was amanure collector in Whitechapel in 1888. We would have no means of being certainthat this man was Jack the Ripper; but he would seem to me far and away thelikeliest candidate.Postscript to Jack the Ripper In 1993, a new – and highly plausible – candidate was added to the list when abook called The Diary of Jack the Ripper was published. The author of the Diary(found scrawled in an old notebook) was James Maybrick, a Liverpool cottonmerchant, whose young wife Florence was accused of poisoning him. Florence wasfound guilty and sentenced to death, but later reprieved. The Diary revealedthat Maybrick was an ‘arsenic eater’ (in small quantities arsenic is a powerfulstimulant), and that he was driven to a frenzy of jealousy by his young wife’sinfidelities. Maybrick spent a great deal of time in Whitechapel on businessand, according to the Diary, vented his fury against Florence by murderingprostitutes.Although the authenticity of the Diary has been widely questioned, powerfulinternal evidence suggests that it was written by James Maybrick, and thatMaybrick was Jack the Ripper."},{"pageContent":"28 Did Joan of Arc Return from the Dead?On 30 May 1431 Joan of Arc was burnt as a heretic by the English; she was onlynineteen years old. She regarded herself as a messenger from Heaven, sent tosave the French from their enemies the English (who were in league with theBurgundians who captured her). At the age of thirteen Joan began to hear voices,which she later identified as those of St Gabriel, St Michael, St Marguerite andSt Catherine. When the news of the encirclement of Orleans reached her littlevillage in Lorraine, Domremy, her voices told her to go to lift the siege. Hermilitary career was brief but spectacular: in a year she won many remarkablevictories, and saw Charles VII crowned at Rheims. Then she was captured by theBurgundians, sold to the English for ten thousand francs, tried as a witch, andburnt alive.But that, oddly enough, was not quite the end of “the Maid”. “Now one monthafter Paris had returned to her allegiance to King Charles”, writes AnatoleFrance, “there appeared in Lorraine a certain damsel. She was about twenty-fiveyears old. Hitherto she had been called Claude; but now she made herself knownto divers lord of the town of Metz as being Jeanne the Maid”. This was in May1436, five years after Joan had died at the stake.It sounds very obviously as if some imposter had decided to pose as Joan theMaid. But there is some astonishing evidence that suggests that this is not so.Joan’s two younger brothers, Petit-Jean and Pierre, were still serving in thearmy, and they had no doubt whatever that their sister had been burnt at Rouen.So when they heard that a woman claiming to be Joan was at Metz, and that shehad expressed a wish to meet them, the brothers hastened to Metz – Petit-Jeanwas not far away, being the provost of Vaucouleurs. One chronicler describes howthe brothers went to the village of La-Grange-aux-Ormes, two and a half milessouth of Metz, where a tournament was being held. A knight in armour wasgalloping around an obstacle course and pulling stakes expertly out of theground; this was the person who claimed to be their sister. The brothers rodeout on to the field, prepared to challenge the impostor. But when Petit-Jeandemanded, “Who are you”?, the “impostor” raised her visor, and both brothersgaped in astonishment as they recognized their sister Joan.In fact Joan was surrounded by various people who had known her during herspectacular year fighting the English, including Nicole Lowe, the king’schamberlain. If she was in fact an impostor, it seems absurd that she should goto a place where she would be sure to be recognized. (John of Metz was one ofher first and most loyal supporters.) And the next day her brothers took her toVaucouleurs, where she spent a week, apparently accepted by many people who hadseen her there seven years earlier, when she had gone to see the local squireRobert de Baudricourt, to ask him to send her to see the Dauphin, the heir tothe throne. After this she spent three weeks at a small town called Marville,then went on a pilgrimage to see the Black Virgin called Notre Dame de Liance,between Laon and Rheims. Then she went to stay with Elizabeth, Duchess ofLuxembourg, at Arlon. Meanwhile her brother Petit-Jean went to see the king andannounced that his sister Joan was still alive. We do not know the king’sreaction, but he ordered his treasurer to give Petit-Jean a hundred francs. Anentry in the treasury accounts of Orléans for 9 August 1436 states that thecouncil authorized payment of a courier who had brought letters from “Jeanne laPucelle” (Joan the Maid).The records of these events are to be found in the basic standard work on Joanof Arc, Jules Quicherat’s five-volume Trial and Rehabilitation of Joan of Arc(1841), which contains all the original documents. One of these documents statesthat on 24 June 1437 Joan’s miraculous powers returned to her. By then she hadbecome something of a protégée of Count Ulrich of Württemberg, who took her toCologne. There she became involved in a clash between two churchmen who wererivals for the diocese; one had been appointed by the chapter, the other by thepope. Count Ulrich favoured one called Udalric, and Joan apparently alsopronounced in his favour. But her intervention did no good; the Council of Basleconsidered Udalric a usurper, and the pope’s nominee was appointed. TheInquisitor general of Cologne became curious about the count’s guest (rememberthat this was at the height of the “witchcraft craze”), and was apparentlyshocked to learn that she practised magic, and that she danced with men and ateand drank more than she ought. (The magic sounds more like conjuring: she tore atablecloth and restored it to its original state, and did the same with a glasswhich she broke against a wall.) He summoned her before him, but she refused toappear; when men were sent to fetch her the count hid her in his house, thensmuggled her out of the town. The inquisitor excommunicated her. Back at Arlon,staying with the Duchess of Luxembourg, she met a nobleman named Robert desArmoires and – no doubt to the astonishment of her followers – married him. (Theoriginal Joan had sworn a vow of perpetual chastity under a “fairy tree” atDomremy.) Then they moved to Metz, where Robert had a house, and during the nextthree years she gave birth to two children.Two years later, in the summer of 1439, the “Dame des Armoires” went to Orléans,whose magistrates gave her a banquet and presented her with 210 livres by way ofthanking her for her services to the town during the siege. Oddly enough, thesesame burgesses had paid for Masses in memory of the Maid’s death three monthsearlier; presumably they must have changed their minds in the meantime. After1439 the Masses ceased.After two weeks she left Orléans in rather a hurry, according to one chronicler,and went to Tours, where she sent a letter to the king via the Baillie ofTouraine, Guillaume Bellier, who had been the Maid’s host ten years earlier.Moreover, she soon afterwards went to Poitou, where she seems to have been giventhe nominal command of a place called Mans – presumably by the king she hadenthroned. Then the king transferred this command to Joan’s ex-comrade in arms,Gilles de Rais. Since the days when he had fought beside Joan before the wallsof Paris, Gilles had begun to practise black magic – in an attempt to repair hisfortunes, drained by his excesses – and had become a sadistic killer ofchildren. In the following year, 1440, Gilles would be tried and condemned to behanged and burned. Meanwhile – assuming he met the Dame des Armoises (whichseems practically certain, since she had to hand over her command to him) – heseems to have accepted her as his former comrade-in-arms. He also placed her inauthority over the men-at-arms.In 1440 Joan finally went to Paris and met the king. And for the first time shereceived a setback; after the meeting the king declared her an impostor. It maybe significant that he did so after the interview. Surely if he could see shewas a fraud he would have said so at the time? He even attempted to practise onher the same trick he had tried at their first meeting eleven years earlier,concealing himself and asking one of his men to impersonate him. But as on theprevious occasion Joan was not to be deceived; she walked straight up to theking and knelt at his feet, whereupon the king said: “Pucelle, my dear, you arewelcome back in the name of God”. It seems, to say the least of it, strange thathe should then have decided she was an impostor.And now, according to the journal “of a Bourgeois of Paris”, Joan was arrested,tried and publicly exhibited as a malefactor. A sermon was preached against her,and she was forced to confess publicly that she was an imposter. Her story,according to the “Bourgeois of Paris”, was that she had gone to Rome about 1433to seek absolution for striking her mother. She had, she said, engaged as asoldier in war in the service of the Holy Father Eugenius, and worn man’sapparel. This, presumably, gave her the idea of pretending to be the Maid . . .But the whole of this story is doubtful in the extreme. To begin with, Joan thenreturned to Metz, and continued to be accepted as “la Pucelle”. In 1443 herbrother Pierre refers to her in a petition as “Jeanne la Pucelle, my sister”,and her cousin Henry de Voulton mentions that Petit-Jean, Pierre and theirsister la Pucelle used to visit the village of Sermaise and feast withrelations, all of whom accepted her. Fourteen years later she makes anappearance in the town of Saumur, and is again accepted by the officials of thetown as the Maid. And after that she vanishes from history, presumably livingout the rest of her life quietly with her husband in Metz.What then are we to make of the story that the king declared her an impostor,and that she admitted it publicly? First of all, its only source is the “journalof a Bourgeois of Paris”. This in itself is odd, if she was involved in such apublic scandal. Moreover, the “bourgeois” was hostile to the earlier Joan, inthe days before her execution. Anatole France mentions that the common people ofParis were in a fever of excitement at the news that the Maid was still aliveand was returning to Paris. The University of Paris was still thoroughly hostileto the Maid, who had been condemned as a witch.Her sentence could only be reversed by the pope, and he showed no sign of doingthis, in spite of a movement to rehabilitate Joan. So as far as the clerks andmagistrates of Paris were concerned, the return of Joan would have been nothingbut an embarrassment. As to those authorities of the Church who were trying tohave the Maid declared innocent (they succeeded in 1456, and Joan was finallycanonized in 1922), they would have found the return of their heroine – alive,healthy and married – an obstacle to their patriotic campaign. The king musthave found himself under intolerable pressure to declare Joan an impostor. Afterall, if he declared her genuine, then it was “official”, and no one in Francehad a right to doubt her identity. Moreover, there would be some question ofpublic recognition . . . On the other hand, if he expressed doubts about her,the whole scandal was defused. She could return home and drop out of sight. Andeveryone would be much happier. And that, it seemed, is precisely what happened.Anatole France takes it for granted that the Dame des Armoises was an impostor.But then his biography of Joan of Arc is permeated with his famous irony, andtakes the view that she was a deluded peasant girl; France was basically adisciple of Voltaire. The notion that she was an impostor is indeed the simplestexplanation. But it leaves us facing the problem: why, in that case, did so manypeople who knew “the Maid” accept the Dame des Armoises as genuine? It isconceivable that her brothers may have decided that it would be to theiradvantage to have their famous sister alive, and so condoned the imposture. Butwhy should so many old comrades have agreed to support the story?The Dame des Armoises never as far as we know explained how she came to escapethe flames. But then presumably she would not know the answer to this question.She would only know that she had been rescued, and that someone else had died inher place – perhaps another “witch”. It is easy to see how this could have comeabout. We know that Joan was an extraordinarily persuasive young lady, and thatdozens of people, from Robert de Baudricourt to the Dauphin, who began byassuming she was mad, ended by believing that she was being guided by divinevoices. We know that even in court Joan declared that she could hear StCatherine telling her what to say. Even at her trial she had certain friends; apriest called Loyseleur was her adviser. When Joan complained about the conductof her two guards the Earl of Warwick was furious, and had them replaced by twoother guards – which suggests that the earl held her in high regard. So it wouldnot be at all surprising if there was a successful plot to rescue her. And it ispossible that the English themselves may have been involved in such a plot; whenJoan was apparently burnt at the stake in Rouen the crowd was kept at a distanceby eight hundred English soldiers, which would obviously prevent anyone comingclose enough to recognize her. At the trial for her rehabilitation in 1456 theexecutioner’s evidence was entirely second-hand, although three of Joan’scomrades who were with her at the “end” – Ladvenu, Massieu and Isambard – wereactually present. If Joan was rescued, presumably they also were involved in theplot.The rehabilitation itself has its farcical aspects. It began in 1450, and Joan’smother was the person who set it in motion, supported by Joan’s brother Pierre.We do not know whether Joan’s mother accepted the Dame des Armoires as herdaughter, but there can be no doubt that she lent credence to the claim by notdenouncing her as an impostor. Yet now she and Pierre joined in the claim thatwas based on the assertion that Joan was executed by the English in 1431. Butthen the aim of the rehabilitation was financial; Joan had been a rich woman,thanks to the generosity of the king, and the wealth remained frozen while Joanwas excommunicated. So, whether or not Joan’s family believed that the Dame desArmoires was the Maid, they now had good reason to try to have her rehabilitated– even if it meant swearing that she was dead.If the Dame des Armoires was genuine, she must have felt there was a certainirony in the situation. She had been an embarrassment to everyone during herfirst career as the saintly virgin warrior; now she was just as much anembarrassment as the heroine returned from the dead. It is thankless work beinga saint."},{"pageContent":"29 JuniusWho Was the Eighteenth Century’s Most Feared Satirist?In these days of investigative journalism, it is almost impossible to imagine aman who succeeds in maintaining a secret identity when everyone in the countryis agog with curiosity to know who he is. It happens only in children’s comics.Yet that is precisely what happened in England in the final years of theeighteenth century. The mystery man was a writer who called himself Junius andwhose murderously satirical letters set the whole country laughing at thegovernment, and even at the King himself. As a satirist and literary stylist,Junius compares favourably with Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift, and Samuel Butler– all of whom published their early works anonymously. But in these famouscases, the sheer brilliance of the satire made it inevitable that the identityof the authors of Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver’s Travels, and Erewhon should bediscovered. Junius’s secret went with him to the grave.The story begins in the reign of George III, the King whose “tea tax” was tocause the American Revolution and whose general Wellington later defeatedNapoléon.George III came to the throne in 1760, and his reign was troubled almost fromthe beginning. Under its greatest war leader, Prime Minister William Pitt,Britain had been fighting France for four years and was winning the war. The newKing was anxious to end it, to the disgust of his subjects, who wanted to seethe French well and truly thrashed. And Pitt – who not only wanted to thrash theFrench but to go to war with the Spaniards as well – resigned in 1761. The warcame to an end two years later, and the “surrender” made the King still moreunpopular.But the real trouble – which brought England close to revolution – was caused bya radical politician named John Wilkes. He was the kind of man who made everyold-fashioned English gentleman foam at the mouth. He was blasphemous, ugly,cross-eyed, and a tireless seducer – but such a natural charmer that he liked toboast that he needed only half an hour’s start on the handsomest man in England.He had been a member of Sir Francis Dashwood’s Hell-Fire Club, a group thatliked to dress as monks and invoke the Devil; Wilkes had terrified them when heintroduced a sooty baboon into one of their orgies and they mistook it forSatan.When Wilkes was elected to Parliament in 1757, he became a supporter of WilliamPitt. And when the King appointed his old tutor, a Scot named Lord Bute, asSecretary of State, and Bute began making peace with the French, Pitt resignedin disgust. Wilkes naturally regarded Bute as an enemy. Besides, most of theEnglish detested the Scots – it was less than twenty years since Bonnie PrinceCharlie had marched on London. So Wilkes founded a violently anti-Scottishnewspaper called The North Briton. (A north Briton was, of course, a Scot – itwas rather as if someone had founded an anti-Semitic newspaper called TheIsraelite.) Among other things it hinted that Lord Bute had gained his positionby sleeping with the Queen Mother, an accusation that made the King apoplectic.The smear campaign was so successful that Bute resigned.But now Wilkes went too far and put into the King’s mouth a satirical speech –supposedly written by Bute – that amounted to an accusation of base betrayal ofBritain’s allies in the war. Wilkes was seized and thrown into the Tower ofLondon, which – inevitably – boosted his popularity with the disgruntledpopulace. Wilkes claimed “Parliamentary privilege” – whereby a Member ofParliament has a right to speak his mind freely on political issues – and wasreleased after a week. He now proceeded to make the King and his governmentstill more embarrassed by suing Lord Halifax, the Secretary of State, fortrespass. (He was backed financially by Lord Temple, Pitt’s brother-in-law, whohad also financed The North Briton.) Wilkes won his case; he was awarded vastdamages – $5,000 – and the Secretary of State lost his job.The King was now out for Wilkes’s blood. To anybody with any sense, it shouldhave been obvious that his administration was accident-prone and had better keepits head down. Instead, the new Secretary of State, Lord Sandwich,14[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2236687] decided tomake Wilkes pay for his victory. The House of Commons voted that Wilkes’s attackon the King had been a “seditious libel”. They also bribed a printer to handover a pornographic poem – entitled “An Essay on Woman” – that Wilkes was havingprinted, and some of its juicier passages were read aloud in the House of Lords.The Lords thought it a joke, for everyone knew that Lord Sandwich had loosermorals than Wilkes. (When Sandwich told Wilkes that he would either die of thepox or on the gallows, Wilkes retorted, “That depends on whether I embrace yourmistress or your principles”.) But Parliament was shocked and voted that Wilkeshad no right to Parliamentary privilege after all. Wilkes was force to fleeabroad to avoid prison, but this only increased his popularity with the mob. Theprinter who had handed over the “Essay on Woman” could find no one to employ himand committed suicide.The King’s next choice as Prime Minister was George Grenville, a former ally ofPitt. He was capable enough but proved to be a bore who was inclined to deliverlong lectures; the King got rid of him in 1765. But it was under Grenville thatthe government first stirred up revolution in the American colonies by imposinga Stamp Act – a tax on newspapers, advertisements, and legal documents. This metwith such violent resistance in America that the next administration was forcedto repeal it. It was a “dry run” for the Boston Tea Party seven years later.Grenville had been one of the chief persecutors of John Wilkes. Now the Kingturned to a defender of Wilkes, the Marquis of Rockingham, who had friends onboth sides, Whig and Tory. Wilkes decided to return to England, and the King’stroubles began all over again. Wilkes stood for a London Parliamentary seat andwas soundly beaten. Since he was an outlaw, the government did its best to havehim arrested. He evaded them and got himself elected MP for Middlesex. Then hegave himself up. If the King had had any sense, he would have pardoned him.Instead, Wilkes received two years in prison and a fine of a thousand pounds.Wilkes instantly became the most popular man in England. An angry crowd rescuedhim from the officers of the law. He gave himself up again and was put in jail.A mob gathered and looked as if it would storm the jail; troops fired and killedfive, wounding fifteen.Wilkes wrote a violent article attacking the use of force against the rioters;Parliament voted it libelous and expelled him again. He got himself reelected byrebellious voters; Parliament threw him out again. He became the most popularcause of his time; there had been nothing like it since Daniel Defoe had gothimself stuck in the pillory – for the same kind of offense – in 1703 and waspelted with flowers instead of rotten eggs. The well-meaning King, with hispathetic desire for popularity and his determination to be a “true Briton” (likeall the Hanovers, he was a German by parentage), was stumbling from disaster todisaster.Rockingham resigned; party quarrels were too much for him. Now the King had anidea that he must have regarded as brilliant and foolproof: to persuade Pitt totake over again. That ought to undo all the squabbling and bitterness of thepast six years. Unfortunately, Pitt’s manic depression was turning into madness.When the King made him Earl of Chatham, Pitt virtually retired to the House ofLords, and the administration was left in the hands of a much younger man, LordGrafton. The country was in a state of chaos.And it was at this point that Junius stepped into the picture.Now whoever Junius was, he was a man who, for some reason, detested the King andhis political allies and was a supporter of Pitt and Wilkes. He had a particularantipathy toward Lord Grafton, who had by now quarreled with Pitt. In 1768 Pittand Grenville – who had also quarreled – received letters signed Junius, urgingthem to make up and unite against Grafton. In fact, Pitt resigned shortlyafterward. Now Junius decided to take his case to the public.His first letter was sent to a newspaper called The Public Advertiser, owned byHenry Sampson Woodfall. Newspapers were still something of a novelty in England.They had begun about fifty years earlier; by Junius’s time there were eleven ofthem in London alone. Most of their profit came from advertisements, butreaders’ letters were also immensely popular – in fact, Junius’s first letter,dated 21 January 1769, was held up for several days while a backlog of letterswas printed.The style of Junius’s letters is not immediately appealing to a modern audience;it seems rather ponderous and pedantic. As far as his contemporaries wereconcerned, however, that was an advantage; they could see that he was a seriousminded man who knew how to turn a good phrase. And the very first sentence ofhis first letter makes it clear that what concerns him is the freedom of theBritish people and the feeling that designing politicians like Prime MinisterGrafton were trying to steal it. Junius starts with a contentious but ratherdull statement: “The submission of a free people to the executive authority ofgovernment is no more than a compliance with laws which they themselves haveenacted”. The English, he goes on to say, are a generous and good-naturedpeople, who naturally respect the law and love their King. So it fills him withindignation to see these good qualities abused by schemers: “The situation ofthis country is alarming enough to rouse the attention of every man . . .” Sofar, his readers must have stifled a yawn. But a few sentences later they werestartled into attention: “The finances of a nation, sinking under its debts andexpenses, are committed to a young nobleman already ruined by play”. To accusethe King’s Prime Minister of being a dissolute gambler was strong stuff.Next, Junius turned his attention to Britain’s most popular soldier, the Marquisof Granby, whose victories in the seven-year war with France had fired Britishpatriotism and led hundreds of pubs and inns to call themselves the Marquis ofGranby. At the battle of Minden, Granby wanted to charge the French, but hissuperior, Lord Sackville, ordered him not to. It later became obvious that ifGranby had been allowed to charge, the French would have been utterly routed.Sackville was dismissed and Granby took his place.But like many fine soldiers, he was out of his depth in politics, and when hewas made peacetime commander-in-chief, he was less than brilliant. Even so, whenJunius remarked with suave malice: “Nature has been sparing of her gifts to thisnoble lord”, it was as shocking as if someone had dismissed Winston Churchill orGeneral Eisenhower as a dithering idiot after the Second World War. And whenJunius went on to accuse Granby of using his position to “heap promotion on hisfavourites and dependants” and ignore merit in the rest of the army, he wasvirtually accusing Britain’s war hero of being a crook.It is not clear whether Junius made these accusations to produce shock andoutrage. But he could hardly have chosen a better way to make himself famous –or infamous. For one of Granby’s most distinguished fellow soldiers, Sir WilliamDraper, quickly leapt to his defense and wrote an indignant letter to The PublicAdvertiser, whose owner must have been rubbing his hands with glee. Draper beganby furiously accusing Junius of being a “felonious robber of private character”,a “cowardly base assassin” who did not have the courage to sign his real name.Then Draper went on to defend his commander-in-chief, saying, in essence, thathe was a “decent chap” whom everybody liked and who was too generous for his owngood.This kind of thing must have made readers groan with boredom. As to not keepinghis promises – another of Junius’s slanders – there were some cases, saidDraper, where it was better not to keep promises. He was obviously thinking ofsome scheming friend of Granby’s who had persuaded the general to make rashpromises when he had had too much to drink – a person, says Draper indignantly,“who would pervert the open, unsuspecting moments of convivial mirth into sly,insidious applications for preferment . . . and who would endeavour to surprisea good man who cannot bear to see anyone leave him dissatisfied”.Junius, of course, had achieved his goal. He was being treated seriously by afamous soldier, and the delighted public was being allowed to witness theirsquabble. Junius’s next letter began with deceptive benevolence and generosity:“Your defense of Lord Granby does honour to the goodness of your heart”. He wenton to praise Draper’s “honest unreflecting indignation” – although the wordunreflecting gave warning of what was to come. Then he took the gloves off andwent straight for the chin: “It is you, Sir William, who makes your friendappear awkward and ridiculous, by giving him a laced suit of tawdryqualifications which nature never intended him to wear”. And he becamepositively murderous when he answered Draper’s ill-advised remarks aboutpromises made in “convivial mirth”. “It is you, Sir William Draper, who havetaken pains to represent your friend in the character of a drunken landlord, whodeals out his promises as liberally as his liquor, and will suffer no man toleave his table sorrowful or sober. None but an intimate friend, who must haveseen him frequently in these unhappy, disgraceful moments, could have describedhim so well”.Draper must have winced. But he lacked the common sense to see that he wasgiving Junius exactly the kind of publicity he wanted. Besides, he had been anacademic and felt he could exchange urbane insults with the best of them. Soback he came for more, this time accusing Junius (probably correctly) of being abitter and disappointed man who “delights to mangle carcasses with a hatchet”.Then he took up the impossible task of defending his friend Granby against thehatchet, failing to realize that he was only succeeding in making him look likea helpless dummy. He went on to answer Junius’s charges that he had featheredhis own nest and entered into precise details about his income that onlyrevealed how much Junius had him on the defensive.Junius came back in his smoothest and deadliest form: “I should justly besuspected of acting upon motives of more than common enmity to Lord Granby, if Icontinued to give you fresh materials or occasion for writing in his defense”.But then he proceeded to indulge in another of his favourite tricks: anappearance of omniscience. He went on to talk about Draper’s income and careeras if he knew more about them than Draper did. Then he accused Draper of being amoney-grubbing liar who had turned his back on the army in exchange for apension – which Junius called a “sordid provision for himself and his family”.Now we can begin to see Junius’s technique. There can be no doubt that he wasbitter and twisted. He was a man with a grievance, and his specialty waslibelous accusations that would cause maximum suffering to the accused, as wellas maximum glee to the general public. One gets the impression that he was akind of sadist who didn’t care what he said so long as it hurt; but he wasclever enough to make his accusations sound plausible – as if he was an insiderwith a secret source of knowledge.The general public, of course, loves to see authority attacked and ridiculed.Things have not changed in the slightest in the two centuries or so that havepassed since the days of Junius; any kind of scandal about a politician canstill sell newspapers. In present-day America, politicians have no legal redressagainst libel – provided malice cannot be established – so that journalists caninvent virtually what they like. After the Kennedy assassination, a play calledMacbird accused Lyndon Johnson of being the murderer; it was pure invention, butits author, a dissident academic, must have been bewildered when it became thehit of the season on Broadway. In England, a magazine called Private Eye hasspecialized since the sixties in libelous and insulting stories that might havebeen concocted by Junius; but although the magazine has been sued to the vergeof bankruptcy, it continues to flourish as the public appetite for malicious“dirt” remains insatiable. Junius was simply the first to discover that there isa permanent demand for “dirt”.The naïve Draper went on to increase Junius’s fame by writing more pained andexplanatory letters; Junius continued to treat him with ferocious contempt. Inhis third letter he dismissed him partronizingly: “And now, Sir William, I shalltake my leave of you for ever . . . In truth, you have some reason to holdyourself indebted to me. From the lessons I have given you, you may collect aprofitable instruction for your future life”.Junius ignored Draper’s third reply and turned his attention to the PrimeMinister, the Duke of Grafton. True to form, Junius accused him of being ascheming politician who preferred his own interests to the public good. Then heturned his attention to a recent scandal concerning the Middlesex by-election,which the government had fervently hoped that Wilkes would lose – and which, infact, Wilkes had won with the aid of a drunken rabble. (Wilkes was now, ofcourse, in jail.)A man named Clarke had been killed in a brawl, and an Irishman named MacQuirk, alocal chairman of the anti-Wilkes party, was accused of his murder, togetherwith another man named Balf. Both were sentenced to death, but this wasobviously unfair; the evidence against Balf was weak, and MacQuirk had obviouslynot intended to commit murder. Both were pardoned by Grafton. Junius pretendedto think that this was an outrageous interference in the course of justice, adeliberate tampering with the evidence; a murderer went free because he wasagainst Wilkes. He ended by asking: “Has it never occurred to you that, whileyou were withdrawing this desperate wretch from justice . . . that there isanother man, who is the favourite of the country, whose pardon would have beenaccepted with gratitude”?He meant, of course, John Wilkes, and he went on to use his favourite techniqueof invention: “Have you quite forgotten that this man was once your Grace’sfriend”? Grafton was to protest again and again that Wilkes was only a casualacquaintance; Junius ignored him and went on repeating his charge; that Graftonhad stabbed his friend in the back. Subsequent investigation by historiansindicates that Grafton was telling the truth. But Junius never let the truthspoil a good accusation.What so alarmed the government – and the King – was that Wilkes’s imprisonmenthad made him potentially the most dangerous man in England. Junius went on toaccuse Grafton of fleeing London for two nights during the Wilkes riots andleaving the city to be defended by two of his incompetent underlings. Graftonhad apparently spent those two nights with his mistress, Nancy Parsons, andJunius jeered at her “faded beauty” – although he later pretended to be shockedwhen Grafton broke with her and married someone else, declaring: “His basenessto this woman is beyond description or belief”. When Grafton married, Juniussneered at him as a reformed rake who had tired of debauchery.Junius’s next letter to Grafton reached new heights of malice: “Let me bepermitted to consider your character and conduct”, he wrote ominously, “merelyas a subject of curious speculation”. And after calling him lazy, dishonest, andinconsistent, he added generously: “For the sake of your mistress, the lovershall be spared. I will not lead her into public, as you have done, nor will Iinsult the memory of her departed beauty. Her sex, which alone made her amiablein your eyes” – he is implying that Grafton will mount anything that wears askirt – “makes her respectable in mine”.He went on to give what he claimed to be a sympathetic account of Grafton’sancestors – “those of your Grace . . . left no distressing examples of virtue” –and of his own career – “grave and plausible enough to be thought fit forbusiness; too young for treachery”. But, he claimed, Grafton lost no time instabbing his patron William Pitt in the back, then grabbing power underRockingham and betraying his friend Wilkes. Like Dr Goebbels, Junius felt thatthe best way to make people believe a lie was to repeat it.After more than two centuries these insults make us smile. But if we try to putourselves in the place of his victims, we can see that they must have feltchoked with hopeless rage. Junius was not a man so much as a scorpion. When oneangry victim challenged Junius to a duel, Junius declined politely: “You wouldfight, but others would assassinate”. He was probably right. The sheer maliceand unfairness of his attacks would have led some of his victims to make sure hewas stabbed in the dark.In December 1769 Junius shocked everyone, including his own supporters, bylaunching an attack on the King himself. His success in evading exposure hadobviously given him the confidence to risk imprisonment. In earlier letters hehad been careful to speak of the King with the deepest respect, referring to himin a letter to Grafton as “an amiable, accomplished prince”. Now he addressedthe King directly, reminding him of one of his earliest utterances when he cameto the throne: “I glory in the name of Briton”. The King undoubtedly meant thathe regarded himself as a Briton rather than a German; Junius pretended to thinkthat he was deliberately making a distinction between Britons and Englishmen, toemphasize his affection for the Scots: “While the natives of Scotland are not inactual rebellion, they are undoubtedly entitled to protection; nor do I mean tocondemn the policy of giving some encouragement to the novelty of theiraffections”.He patronizingly told the King that he attributed his blunders to inexperience.He went on to defend Wilkes and to describe the King’s campaign against him asmean and ridiculous. After taking swipes at the King for oppressing the Irishand the Americans, he warned him against the “fawning treachery” of the Scots.Finally, he told him condescendingly that “the affections of your subjects maystill be recovered” but that this would mean ceasing to be driven by pettyresentments. The King, wrote Junius, should face his subjects like a gentlemanand “tell them you have been fatally deceived” by crooked ministers. He ended ona note of warning that sounded dangerously like sedition. The people were loyalto the House of Hanover, he wrote, because they expected justice. The House ofStuart – to which Bonnie Prince Charlie belonged – was “only contemptible”, butarmed with royal power it would become formidable. “The prince who imitatestheir conduct should be warned by their example” (i.e., by King Charles losinghis head), “and while he plumes himself upon the security of his title to thecrown, should remember that, as it was acquired by one revolution, it may belost by another”.That made everyone gasp. The novelist Horace Walpole – son of a former PrimeMinister – described it as “the most daring insult ever offered to a prince butin times of open rebellion”. The printer, Woodfall, was arrested on a charge ofseditious libel. The jury refused to convict, and he was released on payment ofcosts. Recognizing his own danger, Junius warned Woodfall to take every possibleprecaution, as “I would not survive a discovery three days”.How had he survived discovery for so long? By an elabourate system ofconcealment. It was easy to get his letters to the Public Advertiser – he couldsend them by messenger or by post. But communications from the newspaper werealtogether more dangerous. Many people wrote to Junius and sent him “sensitive”information. Junius had letters addressed to him, via the printer, under variouspseudonyms at various coffeehouses (there were literally hundreds), and theprinter would signal that a letter was waiting by inserting a codedadvertisement in the newspaper. Junius frequently changed his poste restanteaddress at short notice, informing Woodfall with messages like: “Change to theSomerset Coffee House, and let no mortal know the alteration”. And he obviouslyspent some time worrying about what would happen if Woodfall became careless: “Iam persuaded that you are too honest a man to contribute to my destruction”.Junius also corresponded with Wilkes, who was released from jail in 1770 andpromptly returned to Parliament; Wilkes made a few tactful attempts to persuadeJunius to reveal his identity but respected his determination to have noconfidantes.In fact, Junius was beginning to feel tired; the sheer strain of taking onopponent after opponent, like a masked swordsman, was obviously beginning totell. Besides, when Grafton resigned in 1770 – undoubtedly rattled by Junius’sinsults – and Wilkes was released in the same year, Junius had achieved hisbasic purpose. The King refused to be stampeded into making more concessions tothe Libertarian Party and appointed the efficient and good-natured Lord North ashis First Minister Junius had earlier attacked Lord North: “It may be candid tosuppose that he has hitherto voluntarily concealed his talents; intending,perhaps, to astonish the world when we least expect it”. But he proved wrong,and Lord North developed into an excellent administrator.Junius wrote his last public letter in January 1772. When, a year later, HenryWoodfall did his best to induce Junius to return to the fray with hints in thePublic Advertiser, Junius replied: “If I were to write again I must be as sillyas any of the horned cattle that run mad through the City . . . The cause andthe public – both are given up”. In fact, the world had heard its last of Junius– although his collected letters, in book form, achieved considerablepopularity. In this collection Junius wrote: “I am the sole depository of my ownsecret, and it shall perish with me”. And as far as we know, he kept his word.So who was Junius? In the days of Rockingham’s Prime Ministership, the chiefsuspect was the brilliant Irishman Edmund Burke, who was passionately liberal –although by no means radical, like Wilkes. He was a friend of Dr Johnson, OliverGoldsmith, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and David Garrick (the most famous actor of histime). Like Wilkes, he wanted to curb the corrupt practices in the royal courtand so was detested by the King. He argued strongly against the King’s policiesin America, suggesting – correctly – that they would lead to revolution, andafter the Boston tea party he argued for the repeal of the tea tax. If Burke hadbeen listened to, America might well still be a British colony. He was laterhorrified by the French Revolution and became one of its most passionateopponents, thus endearing himself to all his former enemies.Burke was brilliant enough to have written the Junius letters. But he was also aman of immense integrity. So when he wrote to a friend, Charles Townshend, “Inow give you my word and honour that I am not the author of Junius”, we may takeit to be the truth.In the nineteenth century book after book about Junius appeared; speculationsabout his identity became as popular as speculations about the identity of Jackthe Ripper did a century later. (In his edition of the Junius letters, ProfessorJohn Cannon offers a “short list” of sixty-one names.) An obvious possibility isWilkes himself; but the exchange of letters between Wilkes and Junius that latercame to light makes it clear that this is out of the question.One writer announced confidently that Junius was George III himself, avertingrevolution by giving his subjects a chance to let off steam. Another writeridentified Junius as the historian Edward Gibbon, resting his case upon thesheer absence of evidence, which, the writer claimed, only went to prove how farthe historian had gone to conceal his guilty secret. Another staked the claim ofLord George Sackville, the military commander who had been dismissed after thebattle of Minden in favour of the Marquis of Granby; certainly, Junius’s attackson Granby make this plausible, if unlikely. (Sackville was a warm supporter ofthe King.) Lord Chesterfield, the author of the famous Letters to His Son, isanother candidate; but his health at the time was so poor – he was half-blindand bedridden – that it is virtually impossible that he was Junius. Perhaps theunlikeliest nominee was Thomas Paine, the author of The Rights of Man (1791), apolemic directed at Burke. At the time of the Junius letters, Paine was stillstruggling to make a start in life – as a grocer, a tobacconist, a schoolmaster,and an exciseman – and still had a number of years to go before he learned towrite; it was not until 1774 that Benjamin Franklin persuaded him to emigrate toAmerica.All this seems to suggest that Junius was one of the lesserknown names of theperiod. Charles Everett, the editor of the 1927 edition of the letters, devotesa long introduction to proving that Junius was Lord Shelburne, a member of theopposition and later Prime Minister; the historian Sir Lewis Namier destroyedthat case in a brief review in which he pointed out that Shelburne was on theContinent in the summer of 1771 when Woodfall received two private letters fromJunius that had to have been written in London. Shelburne’s private secretary,Laughlin Macleane, has been strongly suggested by two recent academics, one ofwhom has claimed to have a statement, signed by Shelburne, identifying Macleaneas Junius. The chief problem here is that Macleane was attacked by Junius, whomade fun of his stammer. This could have been a deliberate attempt to mislead;but Junius did not use his own name in this attack but another of hispseudonyms, Vindex. And since no one but Woodfall knew that Vindex was Junius,this seems to dispose of Macleane – whether or not Shelburne believed hissecretary to be Junius. Besides, Macleane was an ardent Scottish patriot, andJunius clearly loathed the Scots, losing no opportunity to jeer about theircorruption, stupidity, and cowardice.This brings us to the chief suspect: Sir Philip Francis, who was at the time atwenty-eight-year-old senior civil servant in the War Office. Francis came undersuspicion in 1812, when the private letters of Junius to Woodfall were publishedin a new edition. They revealed that Junius used various other pseudonyms,including Vindex and Veteran. These letters pay close attention to the affairsof the War Office and indicate that Junius knew far more about it than anyoutsider could learn.In 1772, the year the Junius letters ceased, Francis went to India, where heclashed with Warren Hastings – the chief servant of the East India Company,which virtually governed India. On his return to England, he entered Parliamentas a Liberal, was knighted, and pursued Hastings with considerablevindictiveness, being largely instrumental in having him impeached forcorruption and exceeding his powers.In 1813, when he was seventy-three, Francis was identified as Junius in a bookby a man named John Taylor. He flatly denied it, calling the accusation “sillyand malignant”. Yet when he married again in the following year, he gave hiswife the Junius letters as a wedding present. He also gave her Taylor’s book onthe mystery of Junius. His wife took the hint; she had no doubt that he wasJunius. And Francis was aware of this. He had only, she remarked, to deny it,and she would have given up the idea; but he never did.Professor Cannon has no doubt whatever that Francis was Junius. He points outthat in 1772 – before Francis was posted to India at the huge salary of £10,000a year – Junius changed his pseudonym to Veteran. In 1771 Christopher D’Oyly, afriend of Francis, told him he intended to resign as Deputy Secretary of War; itis obvious from their correspondence that both disliked their chief, LordBarrington. Francis hoped to succeed D’Oyly but was passed over in favour of aman named Chamier. “Veteran” was soon writing to his printer: “Having nothingbetter to do, I propose to entertain myself and the public with torturing thatbloody wretch Barrington. He has just appointed a French broker his deputy. Ihear from all sides it is looked upon as a most impudent insult to the army. Becareful not to have it known to come from me. Such an insignificant creature isnot worth the generous rage of Junius”. In which case, why bother with suchsmall fry?In March 1772 Francis resigned his post. Junius wrote to the printer: “Theenclosed is fact, and I wish it could be printed tomorrow. The proceedings ofthis wretch are unaccountable. There must be some mystery in it, which I hopewill soon be discovered to his confusion. Next to the Duke of Grafton, I verilybelieve that the blackest heart in the kingdom belongs to Lord Barrington”. The“enclosed” declared: “I desire you will inform the public that the worthy LordBarrington, not contented with having driven Mr D’Oyly out of the War Office,has at last contrived to expel Mr Francis”.Handwriting evidence also links Francis and Junius. In 1771 a Miss Giles in Bathwas the recipient of some polite verses, and the handwriting on the cover wasthat of Junius. In 1870 a handwriting expert, Charles Chabot, identified theverses as being written by Francis’s cousin, Richard Tilman. Francis’s secondwife later produced copies of the verses in her husband’s handwriting, sayingthat he had given them to her as examples of his own early verses. In lettersdiscovered in the late nineteenth century, Francis’s authorship was confirmed byhis cousin.This raises an obvious question: Surely we have only to compare the handwritingof Junius with that of Francis to have our solution? But it is not as simple asthat. Junius must have known that unless he went to considerable lengths todisguise his handwriting, it could be his downfall. It was only after carefulstudy that Charles Chabot concluded that the handwriting of Junius was adisguised version of Francis’s.Another piece of evidence emerged in 1969, when French research revealed that aFrench ambassadorial report sent to Louis XVI in the 1770s attributed theletters to one Thaddeus Fitzpatrick, a man-about-town. Now in fact, we know thisis impossible because Fitzpatrick died in 1771, while Junius was still writing.But the report declares that Fitzpatrick obtained his information from hisfriend Philip Francis, a clerk in the War Office.Fitzpatrick had quarreled with the actor David Garrick and with Lord ChiefJustice Mansfield, two men who were savaged by Junius. So there is a strong caseto be made for Fitzpatrick being a collabourator of Junius. This does notcontradict Junius’s assertion that he was “the sole depository of his ownsecret”, since this was made in the year after Fitzpatrick’s death.Wherever the French ambassador obtained his information – information that seemsto have been denied to his British colleagues – it certainly has the ring ofplausibility. One of the reasons that posterity has found the Junius problem sofascinating is that he seems to be a solitary outsider figure, a man with atruly awesome gift for savage invective and the cut and thrust of polemic, whosucceeded, like the Scarlet Pimpernel, in keeping his light hidden under abushel. It is a fascinating and romantic conception, but the major objection toit is that it is too romantic. Scarlet Pimpernels exist only in the imaginationof novelists.What seems far more plausible is that a middle-aged man-about-town, who nursespowerful grudges against people he actually knows, should decide to deliver somesharp rebukes under the cloak of anonymity and should take into his confidence asarcastic and disaffected young clerk from the War Office who can provide insideinformation. (One of Francis’s jobs was to report speeches in the House ofLords, so he had the opportunity to overhear much political gossip.) The pictureof two men chuckling and egging one another on is somehow more believable thanthe picture of a solitary misanthrope nursing his own secret. Moreover, ifThaddeus Fitzpatrick was the initiator of the project, this would also explainwhy the later Junius letters – those that followed his death in 1771 – show afalling off in quality. The rear end of the pantomime horse found himself sadlymissing his partner.This could also explain Francis’s curious attitude toward the book that accusedhim of being Junius. More than forty years after the smoke of battle had clearedand most of his victims were dead – including Grafton himself – surely therecould have been no harm in acknowledging that he was Junius? But if this meantacknowledging that he was merely a half of Junius – and the lesser half at that– then it would obviously be far better to keep silent and allow hiscontemporaries – and posterity – to give him the full credit, while continuingto deny it in a manner that convinced nobody. It was a way of having his cakeand eating it.Certainly, everything we know of Francis indicates that he could have beenJunius (or half-Junius). Cannon describes him as “a man of fierce animosities,harsh and sarcastic”. He quarreled with most of his friends and benefactors,says his biographer Herman Merivale, with all “those who wished well to him,defended him, showered benefits on him”. All “appear . . . in his writtenrecords, branded with some unfriendly or contemptuous notice, some insinuated orpronounced aspersion”. Francis broke with two of his former patrons, Henry Foxand John Calcraft, and when they quarreled, made his typically stinging andungenerous assessment of them: “There was not virtue enough in either of them tojustify their quarreling. If either of them had common honesty he could neverhave been the friend of the other”. The phrase has the typical Junian ring.Dining with Francis in the last year of his life, Cannon reports, thephilosopher Sir James Mackintosh was led to comment, “The vigorous hatreds whichseemed to keep Francis alive were very amusing”.In other words, Francis had a streak of paranoia. And this is how Cannonsummarizes Junius: “Junius believed . . . that it was necessary to save theconstitution from violation, but the desperate plot to destroy the liberties ofthe subject existed only in his own mind”.There is not enough space here to describe the affair of the impeachment ofWarren Hastings and Francis’s part in it; but it confirms that Francis was a manwho, like Junius, was a good hater with little generosity.Finally, in the 1950s, a Swedish philologist, Alvar-Ellegard, undertook acomputer analysis of the writing of Junius and of forty of his contemporaries,looking for recurrent words, tricks of style, and so on. Ellegard began by beinga skeptic about Francis; he ended by being totally convinced that he was Junius:“The statement that Sir Philip Francis was Junius may henceforth be allowed tostand without a question mark”.But does the identity of Junius matter? The answer must be yes, for he appearedat a vital moment in history. When George III came to the throne, Britishpolitics was notoriously corrupt; it was taken for granted that a man went intothe House of Commons to make his fortune. He expected to take money in exchangefor favours. It was not even regarded as reprehensible – merely as normal andnatural. The King himself spent his vast “privy purse” – more than a millionpounds – in bribing Members of Parliament. (At least he was not, like some ofhis European counterparts, an absolute monarch who could merely order them tovote as he pleased.) Junius lost no opportunity to jeer at this corruption.Newspapers had begun in the reign of Queen Anne (1702–14), but they were littlemore than entertainment. Junius changed all that. His outrageous lettersrevealed that you did not have to be a King or a Member of Parliament to exertpressure on the government. Under Queen Elizabeth or Charles I, such attackswould have been regarded as high treason; there would have been torture andexecutions by the dozen. Woodfall’s trial and acquittal (1770) revealed thateven Parliament lacked the power to silence criticism.Newspapers began to report Parliamentary debates and laid themselves open toprosecution. In 1771 a newspaper referred to a Member of Parliament, ColonelGeorge Onslow, as “the little scoundrel” and “that paltry, insignificantinsect”. When he complained, the House ordered the arrest of the printers. Theprinters fought back, arrested the men sent to arrest them, and hauled them infront of the Lord Mayor and two aldermen (one of whom was Wilkes, recently outof jail). When the Lord Mayor countermanded the arrest order, Parliament orderedthat he be committed to the Tower of London. His supporters rose up and rioted;they hissed the King, invaded Parliament, and attacked the carriages of MPs. TheLord Mayor was hastily released. And the newspapers took advantage of thistriumph to resume their reports of Parliamentary debates.Parliament itself was forced to order publication of its debates in full – thefirst “Hansard” (named for Luke Hansard, the publisher) appeared in 1774. Fromthen on, a free press was taken for granted, and the opinions of the peoplebecame as important as the opinions of the King and his ministers. Bribery andcorruption became the exception rather than the rule.Junius, of course, cannot take all the credit for this revolution; Wilkes hadstarted it with his North Briton article, which in turn was inspired by Pitt andhis brother-in-law. But Junius added yeast to the mixture; he stirred up theissues and raised a spirit of rebellion that looked, at one point, as if itwould lead to a revolution like the one that swept France two decades later.It is difficult to feel much sympathy for Junius as a man; he was obviously athoroughly unpleasant character: mean, envious, and paranoid. His rage was notgenerous but vindictive. But his formidable literary talent, comparable to thatof Swift, changed the course of British history, creating a spirit of freedomthat went on to change the course of world history. It is impossible to think ofany historical figure of comparable influence whose identity has remainedunknown. But then, as Junius himself remarked smugly: “The mystery of Juniusincreases his importance”."},{"pageContent":"30 Fedor KuzmichDid the Tsar Die an Unknown Monk?In 1836 a sixty-year-old beggar named Fedor Kuzmich was arrested as a vagrantnear the town of Krasnophinsk, in the province of Perm, Russia, and wassentenced to twenty blows of the knout (whip). Then he was sent to Siberia –Russia’s penal colony. There, at Nerchinsk, near Tomsk, he became a hermit andacquired a reputation for saintliness.Fedor Kuzmich impressed all who saw him. He was tall and broad-shouldered, andof majestic appearance, producing in everyone a sense of awe and veneration. Hisvoice, too, seems to have been that of an educated man, and his speech wasgentle and deliberate. In spite of his gentleness, however, there were timeswhen he became impatient and imperious, and the peasants who approached him feltthe urge to fall to their knees.Kuzmich always turned aside inquiries about his early life. But occasionally, hemade some remark that suggested he had fought in the Russian Army againstNapoléon; he spoke of the campaign of 1812 and of the victorious entry intoParis of the Russians and their allies on 31 March 1814. The meticulous tidinessof his cell suggested army training.Kuzmich had remarkable powers as a healer, and people came to see him from allover Siberia. And according to his biographer, Schilder (author of a pamphletthat became immensely popular in the 1890s), two former servants from the Tsar’spalace were among these visitors – they had been exiled to Siberia, and when oneof them fell ill, his companion decided to go and see the healer, to ask if hecould help his sick comrade. According to Schilder, the man entered the cellalone, leaving a guide – probably a monk – outside; and when he saw the hermit,he felt obliged, like so many others, to fall to his knees. The old man raisedhim to his feet and began to speak; with astonishment, the man recognized thevoice of Tsar Alexander I. And as he stared at the white-bearded features, herecognized the face of his former master. He fell down in a swoon. The guideoutside heard his cry and came in; Fedor Kuzmich told him gently, “Take him backhome. And when he regains his senses, warn him not to tell anybody what he saw.Tell him that his friend will recover”. Kuzmich proved to be right.The story that Alexander had been recognized by one of his former servants soonspread all over Russia and was the subject of some official correspondence.Alexander’s biographer, Maurice Paleologue, described (in The Enigmatic Tsar,1938) how an old soldier who had been sent to the prison of Nerchinsk saw thehermit and instantly stiffened to attention, saying, “It’s our beloved TsarAlexander Pavlovich”!Fedor Kuzmich died in 1864 at the age of eighty-seven – precisely the ageAlexander I would have been if he had lived.Is it conceivable that a modern Tsar of Russia, the man who defeated Napoléon,should have quietly vanished and become a hermit? It is true that Ivan theTerrible abdicated in his mid-thirties and retired to a monastery; his subjectshad to go and beg him to return. But that was in 1564, in a Russia that wasstill virtually medieval, not in the enlightened nineteenth century. Tounderstand how it might be possible, we need to know a little of Russia’sappallingly bloody and violent history.The first absolute Tsar was Ivan the Terrible, who came to the throne in 1547and who was a paranoid maniac. He began his reign by having his chief advisertorn apart by his hunting dogs – Ivan was in his teens at the time. He thenembarked on a career of rape, murder, and torture – he regarded every woman inMoscow as a member of his private harem. Marriage seemed to reform him, but whenhis wife died, he became more paranoid than ever and went on to perpetrate someof the most appalling cruelties in history. While besieging the city ofNovgorod, he had a timber wall built around it so that no one could escape. Whenthe city fell, he directed a massacre that went on for five days; husbands andwives were forced to watch one another being tortured; mothers saw their babiesill treated before they themselves were roasted alive. Sixty thousand peoplewere executed. When he besieged Weden, in Livonia, hundreds of citizenspreferred to blow themselves up in a castle rather than fall into his hands; hehad all the remaining townsfolk tortured to death.Ivan was the worst of the Tsars, but only just. Even rulers we like to think ofas “enlightened” – Peter the Great, Catherine the Great – were capable ofordering mass executions and torture. Peter the Great’s niece earned herself thetitle of Anna the Bloody, while Catherine’s son Paul – the child of her firstlover, Saltykov – was a madman who oppressed the peasantry in a way that madethem feel Ivan the Terrible was back. (Since 1649 – the year Charles I wasexecuted in England – Russian peasants were not allowed to leave their owners’estates and were merely “property”.)By 1801 the paranoid Tsar Paul was living in seclusion in a newly built palacethat was surrounded by canals and had imposed a nine o’clock curfew on StPetersburg – whose reaction to it was much as it would have been in London orParis. On March 23 the regiment of his son Alexander was guarding the palace.Alexander had suffered greatly from his father’s arbitrary despotism and hadimbibed liberal ideas from Europe; he agreed with his father’s chief adviser,Count Pahlen, that Paul had to be deposed. He is supposed to have insisted thatPaul’s life should be spared, but few historians believe that he meant it. Agroup of conspirators was admitted to the palace after dark and entered theTsar’s bedroom; he was ordered to abdicate, then strangled with a scarf. Thepeople of Russia went mad with joy when Alexander became their Tsar; they feltthat a nightmare was over.It certainly looked as if it was. The handsome, charming young Tsar met everyday with a group of liberal friends to discuss over coffee the way to regeneratehis country through freedom of the individual. He quickly made peace with theEnglish – to the disgust of Napoléon. He had no doubt that the first major stepwas the abolition of serfdom; but that was easier said than done. His ministerSperansky, the son of a village priest, was asked to draft a constitution for ademocratic Russia; but even he advised against freeing the serfs at one blow.Alexander had to be contented with a decree that allowed anyone to own land, aright that had previously been restricted to the nobility. He also made adetermined effort to increase the number of schools and universities. He allowedstudents to travel abroad, lifted the ban on the import of foreign books, andclosed down the secret police department.A first step toward the liberation of the serfs was left in suspension whileRussia went to war with Persia over Russia’s annexation of Georgia – a warRussia eventually won. But Alexander’s chief problem, of course, was Napoléon,with whom his father, Paul, had been on friendly terms. In 1805 Alexander joinedEngland, Austria, and Sweden in an alliance against Napoléon. Britain defeatedNapoléon’s fleet at Trafalgar, but the Russians and Austrians were defeated byNapoléon at Austerlitz. A series of treaties with Napoléon followed, andAlexander became Napoléon’s ally under the Treaty of Tilsit (1807). Alexanderwent on to fight successful wars against Turkey and Sweden, acquiring Bessarabiaand Finland. The starry-eyed liberal was becoming a conquering hero.By 1812 it was obvious that Napoléon and Alexander disliked each other too muchto remain allies; in June Napoléon’s Grand Army, strengthened by Italians,Poles, Swiss, Dutch, and Germans, invaded Russia. It looked like the end forAlexander. Smolensk fell; the Russians were defeated at Borodino; inmid-September the French entered Moscow. The next day the city burst intoflames. Alexander declined to make terms, and a month later, Napoléon began hisdisastrous retreat. Besieged by the Russians and by the Russian winter, theFrench troops died in droves; Napoléon fled to Paris, leaving behind half amillion corpses. The Prussians now deserted Napoléon and joined the Russians.And although Napoléon raised another army and had some remarkable victories, hecould not prevent the allies from entering Paris in March 1814. In April,Napoléon abdicated and was exiled to Elba.Alexander had defeated the “Corsican monster”; he was adored by all hissubjects. If history were predictable, he would have completed his reforms andbecome the most popular monarch in Europe. Unfortunately, Alexander’s ten yearsof war had turned him into a realist and made him repent of the liberaldelusions of his youth. Under the influence of a dubious visionary named Juliede Krüdener, he dreamed up an idea called the Holy Alliance, in which the headsof Europe would unite under Christian principles of faith and justice; Britishstatesman Castlereagh called it “sublime mysticism and nonsense”. Yet it wasdeeply typical of Alexander. He had always struck those who knew him well as aself-divided man, and it is said – although it is not clear with how much truth– that he never ceased to reproach himself for the murder of his father.Alexander was a famous charmer, as well as a man of sentiment; but the continualexercise of his charm must have made him wonder sometimes whether he was a manor a mouse. To begin with, he continued to live up to his liberal pledges,conferring a constitution on Poland and emancipating the serfs in the Balticprovinces. But in Russia itself, he took care to maintain the status quo. Hebegan to tighten the screws on education, placing conservatives in charge ofuniversities. Censorship was introduced and liberal professors were purged.One of Alexander’s chief problems was the army. Understandably, he felt that ahuge standing army was necessary. But this was enormously expensive. He devisedwhat he considered a brilliant solution to the problem: military colonies. Localpeasants had to maintain the army units, and the soldiers had to work the landlike peasants. These units were a combination of barracks, collective farms, andconcentration camps. They were the most hated feature of Alexander’s reign.Yet, oddly enough, he encouraged the flowering of literature that was takingplace, becoming the personal patron – and in some ways the jailer – of the greatromantic poet Alexander Pushkin. (One reason for this may have been his desireto get Pushkin’s lovely wife into bed – Alexander, like most of the RussianTsars, lost no opportunity to seduce a pretty girl.) Under Alexander, Russianliterature began to develop into one of the great literatures of the world.It was this combination of freedom and repression that nurtured the Decembristrevolution that would break out three weeks after his death.15[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2236954] Young officerswho had imbibed liberal ideas in Europe joined together in 1816 to form aliterary discussion group called the Faithful Sons of the Fatherland. It struckthem as outrageous that Russia should be drifting back into despotism, and theybegan to talk revolution. In 1820 Alexander’s own Semyonovsky regiment mutiniedagainst a harsh commander; Alexander proceeded to post its officers to otherparts of Russia. Alexander soon became aware that his officers were conspiringagainst him, yet he seemed oddly indifferent and disillusioned. In hismid-forties, he felt the irony of the situation: a liberal Tsar who hadconquered Napoléon, he had become a symbol of oppression to the very officerswho had once regarded him as Russia’s brightest hope. For many years, hismarriage to the beautiful Empress Elizabeth had been a marriage in name only;they were childless, and he took a succession of mistresses. Life seemedcuriously empty. When told of the proliferation of secret societies he saidwearily, “I myself have shared and encouraged these errors and delusions . . . Ihave no right to punish them”. A stronger and more ruthless man would have hadall the conspirators arrested and tried; Alexander had no stomach for abloodbath. He began to speak longingly of abdicating, of becoming a privatecitizen in Switzerland, or a botanist on the Rhine.When informed of the death of his child by his Polish mistress, Marie Naryshkin,he burst into tears in front of his officers. A few days later, he began totravel feverishly all over Russia and covered three thousand miles in fourmonths – an achievement that arouses no astonishment nearly two centuries laterbut which, in those days of bumpy carriages and roads full of potholes, was aconsiderable feat. Back in St Petersburg in November 1824, he witnessed a majordisaster: the river Neva flooded half the city. When he heard a man cryingdesperately, “It’s a punishment for our sins”, he replied, “No, it’s apunishment for my sins”.Revolt was everywhere. Pushkin said, “Holy Russia is becoming uninhabitable”.The Tsar’s favourite aide-de-camp died, and the Empress fell ill; Alexander feltthat his life was falling apart. And when the Empress decided to try torecuperate in Taganrog, on the Sea of Azov, the Emperor announced that he wouldgo with her. People were puzzled about the choice of Taganrog, which was not ahealth resort but a small fortress town in wild and swampy country. Why did shenot choose Italy?Before the Emperor set out from the capital, he attended a service at amonastery, then spent some time with an old hermit who was greatly revered. Theyhad a long talk, and when Alexander left he remarked, “I have heard manysermons, but none has moved me as much as that old monk. How sorry I am not tohave known him sooner”.He went to Taganrog, and the Empress – whose illness prevented her from hurrying– arrived ten days later. For a month they lived simply and peacefully together,and it seemed that their love had achieved an Indian summer. Then Alexander wasagain seized by his wanderlust and set out on a tour of the Crimea. When hereturned to Taganrog on 16 November, he was feverish.And, according to the history books, he died there on 1 December 1825. Foureyewitnesses vouch for it: the Empress herself, his aide-de-camp, PrinceVolkonsky, his personal physician, the Englishman Sir James Wylie, and the courtphysician, Tarassov. So why should we not accept this as the truth?To begin with, because the diaries and letters of the witnesses contradict oneanother; for example, one says he is getting steadily worse, while anotherstates that he is feeling much better and is gay and smiling. One thing that iscertain is that the Tsar consistently refused all medicines during his lastillness.23 November 1825, seems to have been the crucial day. In the morning, aftersleeping well, the Tsar sent for his wife and remained in conversation with herfor about six hours. They were evidently discussing something of considerableimport. She wrote to her mother: “When you think you have arranged everythingfor the best, there comes an unexpected trial which makes it impossible for youto enjoy the happiness surrounding you”. Happiness, when her husband wasseriously ill? Does it not sound, rather, as if she is now certain that he isrecovering and that after their reconciliation, she is now looking forward to anew and intimate relation with her husband – and then, suddenly, some newobstacle has arisen that has dashed her hopes? Could it be that her husband hasconfided to her that he sees this illness as an opportunity to put into practicehis scheme of “disappearing”?Moreover, after writing this letter, there is a sudden gap in her diary.Paleologue suggests that the diary entries were destroyed by Tsar Nicholas I –Alexander’s younger brother – when he came to the throne. This is plausible,since Nicholas I is known to have destroyed many papers belonging to his olderbrother, as well as the Empress’s diary. But if the Empress had just been toldby her husband that he intended to disappear, this would be a still betterexplanation; it is surely unlikely that she would have continued to keep herdiary, with the incriminating evidence.Another curious incident occurred. Prince Volkonsky recorded in his diary thatAlexander had suggested that his illness should be made known to his youngerbrother, the Grand Duke Constantine, who was heir to the throne. (In fact, hedeclined it and allowed Nicholas to take over.) Volkonsky gave the date for thisrequest as 21 November – then amended it to 23 November, the day of the Tsar’slong talk with his wife. It may have been a genuine error. Or it may havereflected a desire to support the story that the Tsar began to deteriorate on 23November. That he was not in an enfeebled state is proved by the fact that afterhis six-hour talk with his wife, he then wrote a long letter to his mother, theDowager Empress Marie – a highly dominant woman – which has since disappeared.Nicholas I later destroyed the diary of the Tsar’s mother, as well as all papersrelating to Alexander’s last years. The evidence is purely circumstantial, butit certainly fits the hypothesis that 23 November was the day on which Alexandertold his wife that he intended to abdicate; the day on which he relayed thisnews to his mother and to his aide-de-camp and physicians – with instructions tofalsify their diaries.Four days later the parish priest of Taganrog, Father Fedotov, arrived to giveAlexander Communion. Four days after that, Alexander died. Is it credible thathe failed to ask the priest to come again? We would expect the opposite from aman of his religious and mystical tendencies – that is, that when he believed hewas dying, he would have kept the priest by him most of the time. Neither werethere any last rites, such as all the previous Tsars had received. Instead,Alexander apparently died without any of the comforts of religion – which soundsas absurd as a pope dying without the final sacrament.Ten doctors signed the autopsy report on the day after the Tsar’s death. Thisreport provides the most positive evidence that the corpse was not that of theTsar and that another corpse had been found during the thirty-two hours that hadelapsed since his death. Alexander is reported to have died of malaria, whichcauses the spleen to hypertrophy. But the spleen of the corpse was quite normal.Examination of the brain revealed that the man had suffered from syphilis. ButAlexander, says Paleologue, was known to be immune to syphilis. He had had manymistresses, and his favourite mistress, Marie Naryshkin, had many lovers. Hispromiscuity must have led him to consult his physicians about the possibility ofvenereal disease on several occasions; medical reports show that he had alwaysremained immune.The back and loins of the corpse were brownish-purple and red; this might beexpected of a peasant who took no care of his skin – or who had been recentlyflogged – but hardly of a Tsar.But where could the corpse have been obtained? There is no difficulty inanswering this question if we recall that Taganrog was a garrison town full ofsoldiers. Maurice Paleologue (who was the French ambassador at the court ofNicholas II, the last of the Tsars) reports that there is some evidence (heagrees that it is “faint”, because such matters were kept secret) that the headphysician of the military hospital, Dr Alexandrovitch, happened to have in hishands the body of a soldier who was roughly the same height and size as theTsar. If the body was that of a soldier – possibly a Tatar – it could explainwhy the skin of the loins and back was purple; soldiers were often beaten.Oddly enough, Dr Tarassov, the royal surgeon, later declared that he had notsigned the autopsy report. Yet the report is signed by Tarassov. Why didTarassov think he had not signed it? Was it because he did not wish to put hisname to a document he knew to be false? On the other hand, an unsigned autopsyreport would confirm suspicions if any question of the Tsar’s “survival” arose,and it would therefore be logical for someone to forge Tarassov’s signature.It is also known that when the Tsar’s remains were exposed to public view – asthey had to be by custom – in the church at Taganrog, everyone who looked at theface said the same thing: “Is that the Tsar? How he has changed”.Another curious event occurred when the coffin was on its way back to StPetersburg – or rather, to the summer palace in Tsarskoe Selo – in the followingMarch. (In the freezing Russian winter, the body was perfectly preserved, as ifit had been kept in a deep freeze.) When the coffin reached Babino, fifty milesfrom its destination, the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna came – alone – to seeit. She ordered the coffin to be opened, took a long look at the body, and thenleft. It seems odd that she should have made the journey to Babino when shecould just as easily have seen the body in St Petersburg. It is recorded thatshe had recently received “a very grave confidence” from Princess Volkonsky,wife of the Tsar’s aide-de-camp. If that confidence was that the corpse was notthat of the Tsar, it would certainly explain her visit in midwinter. If weassume that the letter of 23 November had simply told her that Alexander haddecided to abdicate, and the next news she received was of his death, then itbecomes understandable that she was anxious to find out as quickly as possiblewhether it was true that her son was still alive. She did not want to see thebody in the presence of other people.Alexander was taken to the summer palace in Tsarskoe Selo, although it mighthave been expected that he would lie in state in St Petersburg so that hissubjects could see him for the last time. Instead, only the royal family filedpast the coffin in the chapel. As the Dowager Empress did so, she made thecurious remark, “Yes, that is my dear son Alexander” and kissed the brow of thecorpse. The body was then taken to the Peter and Paul Fortress and placed in atomb.Forty years later the new Tsar, Alexander II, heard the rumors that the hermitFedor Kuzmich, who had died in the previous year, was actually Tsar Alexander I.He ordered the tomb to be opened. This was done at night, under the direction ofthe minister of the imperial court, Count Adlersberg. The coffin proved to beempty. The tomb was then resealed without the coffin. Paleologue records thatthe tomb was opened again in the reign of Tsar Alexander III and that the coffinwas missing. In contradiction to this, the historian R. D. Charques records, ina footnote in his Short History of Russia (1956), that the coffin was openedagain by the Bolsheviks in the 1920s and found to be empty.But in his introduction to Tolstoy’s Death of Ivan Ilyich (which contains hisstory “Fedor Kuzmich”), Tolstoy’s translator, Aylmer Maude, states that in 1927the Soviet government had the imperial tombs opened and that that of Alexander Icontained only a bar of lead. This sounds altogether more likely. It suggeststhat Paleologue’s account is the correct one and that Charques wrote coffin whenhe meant tomb. In fact, a completely empty coffin would not be placed in thetomb, since it would be evident to those who lifted it that it was empty;something would almost certainly be placed inside to give it weight, and thatsomething might well be a bar of lead. When the coffin was found to be empty byCount Adlersberg, this might well have been left behind in the tomb.Tolstoy was intrigued by the story of Fedor Kuzmich and, as already noted,sketched out a story – unfinished at the time of his death – about it. Tolstoy’s“Fedor Kuzmich” purports to be the diary of Alexander I. The protagonistdescribes himself as “the greatest of criminals”, the murderer of hundreds ofthousands of people as well as of his own father. In Taganrog, he says, hereceived a letter from his minister, Arakcheyev, describing the assassination ofArakcheyev’s voluptuous mistress; this, he says, filled him with lustfulthoughts. Early the next morning he walked out alone, heard the sound of drumsand flutes, and realized that a soldier was being made to run the gauntlet –that is, to run halfnaked between lines of colleagues who would beat him withrods. The thought of the murdered girl and of a soldier being beaten with rods“merged into one stimulating sensation”. He then realized that the soldier whowas being beaten bore a striking resemblance to himself; it was a man namedStrumenski, who was sometimes jokingly called Alexander II. He had been in theTsar’s old regiment and was now being punished for attempted desertion. Two dayslater the Tsar made inquiries and learned that Strumenski was dying. It was whenhis chief of staff was telling him about various conspiracies that the desire toabdicate again came upon him with tremendous force, and he realized that thedeath of Strumenski would provide him with the opportunity he needed. And when,the following day, he cut himself badly while shaving, and collapsed on thefloor, he decided that the time had come to put his plan into operation.Tolstoy’s version assumes that Alexander decided to vanish on impulse inTaganrog; Paleologue suspects that he chose Taganrog because he had alreadyplanned his disappearance.Oddly enough, Paleologue doubts whether Fedor Kuzmich was Alexander I – he citesa story to the effect that an English lord picked up the Tsar in his yacht andthat Alexander died as a monk in Palestine. This is, in a sense, more logicalthan the notion that he became a wanderer in Russia, where he would have beeneasily recognized.Many historians, including Charques, dismiss the notion that Alexander Isurvived his “death” in Taganrog. In The Court of Russia in the NineteenthCentury (1908), E. A. Brayley Hodgetts cites the report of Sir James Wylie, theTsar’s English doctor, who examined the body and diagnosed that the death wasdue to “bilious remittent fever”. But if Alexander “disappeared”, then Wylie wasundoubtedly part of the conspiracy. And the doubts about the disappearancetheory must be balanced against the evidence of the empty tomb and against thewhole strange story of Alexander’s final illness and death. It now seemsunlikely that anyone will ever prove that Alexander I arranged his owndisappearance. But the reason that it is unlikely – that all the relevantdiaries and letters have mysteriously vanished – suggests that it is true."},{"pageContent":"31 The Loch Ness MonsterLoch Ness, the largest of British lakes, is twenty-two miles long and about amile wide; at its greatest depth, it is 950 feet deep. It is part of the GreatGlen, which runs like a deep crack right across Scotland, from one coast to theother; it opened up between 300 and 400 million years ago as a result ofearthquakes, then was deepened by glaciers. At the southern end of the lochthere is the small town of Fort Augustus; at the northern end, Inverness. Untilthe eighteenth century, the loch was practically inaccessible, except by windingtrackways; it was not until 1731 that General Wade began work on the road thatruns from Fort Augustus up the south side of the loch (although Fort Augustuswas not so christened until 1742). But this steep road, which makes a longdetour inland, was obviously not the shortest distance between Fort Augustus andInverness; the most direct route would run along the northern shore. In theearly 1930s a road was finally hacked and blasted out of this northern shore,and vast quantities of rock were dumped down the steep sides of Loch Ness.The road had only just been completed in April 1933, and it was on the 14th ofthat month that Mr and Mrs John Mackay, proprietors of the Drumnadrochit Hotel,were returning home from a trip to Inverness. It was about three in theafternoon when Mrs Mackay pointed and said, “What’s that, John”? The water inthe middle of the loch was in a state of commotion; at first she thought it wastwo ducks fighting, then realized that the area of disturbance was too wide. Asher husband pulled up they saw some large animal in the middle of the surgingwater; then as they watched the creature swam towards Aldourie pier on the otherside of the loch. For a moment they glimpsed two black humps, which rose andfell in an undulating manner; then the creature made a half-turn and sank fromsight.The Mackays made no attempt to publicize their story, but gossip about thesighting reached a young water bailiff, Alex Campbell, who also happened to belocal correspondent for the Inverness Courier; he called on the Mackays, and hisreport went into the Courier on 2 May, more than two weeks after the sightingoccurred. The editor is said to have remarked: “If it’s as big as they say, it’snot a creature it’s a monster”. And so the “Loch Ness Monster” acquired itsname.This was not, strictly speaking, the first account of the monster to appear inprint. This distinction belongs to a Life of St Columba dating from about AD565. This tells (in vol. 6, book 11, chap. 27) how the saint arrived at a ferryon the banks of the loch and found some men preparing to bury a comrade who hadbeen bitten to death by a water monster while he was swimming. The saint orderedone of his own followers to swim across the loch. The monster heard thesplashing and swam towards him, at which the saint made the sign of the crossand commanded the creature to go away; the terrified monster obeyed . . .Other reportings down the centuries are more difficult to pin down; in his bookon the monster, Nicholas Witchell mentions a number of references to the “beast”or “water kelpie” (fairy) of Loch Ness in old books between 1600 and 1800. Andafter Commander Rupert Gould published a book on the monster in 1934, a Dr D.Mackenzie of Balnain wrote to Gould claiming to have seen it in 1871 or 1872,looking rather like an upturned boat but moving at great speed, “wriggling andchurning up the water”. Alex Campbell, the water bailiff, reported that acrofter named Alexander MacDonald had seen the monster in 1802 and reported itto one of Campbell’s ancestors. But hearsay reports like this inevitably ledsceptics to suspect that local people, particularly hoteliers, had a financialinterest in promoting the monster, so that by the mid-1930s “Nessie” (as she wassoon christened in the area) had become something of a joke. In fact the first“modern” report of the monster had occurred in 1930; the Northern Chroniclereported that three young men who were out in a boat fishing on 22 July of thatyear, close to Dores, on the southern shore, saw a loud commotion in the waterabout 600 yards away, and some large creature swimming towards them just belowthe surface; it turned away when it was about 300 yards away. The young mencommented that it was “certainly not a basking shark or a seal”.That summer of 1933 was one of the hottest on record, and by the end of thesummer the Loch Ness monster was known to readers all over the British Isles; itwas still to become a world-wide sensation.By now the monster had also been sighted on land. On a peaceful summerafternoon, 22 July 1933, Mr and Mrs George Spicer were on their way back toLondon after a holiday in the Highlands. At about four o’clock they were drivingalong the southern road from Inverness to Fort William (the original GeneralWade road) and were on the mid-portion between Dores and Foyers. About twohundred yards ahead of them they saw a trunk-like object apparently stretchingacross the road. Then they saw that it was in motion, and that they were lookingat a long neck. This was soon followed by a grey body, about five feet high (MrSpicer said later “It was horrible – an abomination”) which moved across theroad in jerks. Because they were on a slope, they could not see whether it hadlegs or not, and by the time their car had reached the top of the slope it hadvanished into the undergrowth opposite. It seemed to be carrying something onits back. They saw no tail, and the drawing that Commander Gould made laterunder their direction justifies Mr Spicer’s description of a “huge snail with along neck”. When Gould heard of this sighting he thought it was a hoax; butafter he had interviewed the Spicers in London he had no doubt that they weretelling the truth. The Spicers still seemed shaken and upset. It was latersuggested the object over the monster’s shoulder could have been a dead sheep.In 1971 Nicholas Witchell interviewed Mrs Margaret Cameron, who claimed to haveseen the monster on land when she was a teenager, during the First World War;she said, “It had a huge body and its movement as it came out of the trees waslike a caterpillar”. She also described it as being about twenty feet long, andsaid that it had two short, round feet at the front, and that it lurched fromside to side as it entered the water. She and her friends felt so sick and upsetthat they were unable to eat their tea afterwards. Witchell also interviewed aman called Jock Forbes, who claimed to have seen the monster in 1919, when hewas twelve; it was a stormy night, and he and his father were in a pony and trapwhen the pony shied, and they saw something large crossing the road ahead ofthem, then heard a splash as it plunged into the loch.In November 1933 “Nessie” was photographed for the first time. Hugh Gray, anemployee of the British Aluminium Company, was walking on a wooded bluff, fiftyfeet above the loch, near Foyers. He had seen the monster on a previousoccasion, and was now carrying a camera. It was Sunday 12 November 1933, a sunnymorning, and Gray sat down for a moment to look out over the loch. As he did sohe saw the monster rising up out of the water, about two hundred yards away. Heraised his camera and snapped it while it was two or three feet above thesurface of the water. It is not the clearest of all photographs – it is easy tofocus attention on the dark shadow and to overlook the vague, greyish bulk ofthe creature rising from the water above it. This was only one of five shots;the others seem to have been even less satisfactory. Gray was so ambivalentabout the sighting – afraid of being subjected to derision – that he left thefilm in his camera for two weeks, when his brother took it to be developed. Itappeared in the Scottish Daily Record and the London Daily Sketch on 6 December1933, together with a statement from the Kodak film company that the negativehad not been retouched. But Professor Graham Kerr, a zoologist at GlasgowUniversity, declared that he found it utterly unconvincing as a photograph ofany living thing. It was the beginning of the “debunking” of the monster, inwhich major zoologists were to be prominent for many decades to come.And the sightings continued. The day after Hugh Gray had snapped the monster, DrJ. Kirton and his wife were walking down the hill behind the Invermoriston Hotelwhen they saw the monster swimming away from them. They saw a rounded back witha protuberance in the middle, “like the rear view of a duck in a pond”. Gouldlists this as the twenty-sixth sighting of 1933. A week later, on the 20th ofNovember, the monster was seen lying motionless in the water for some tenminutes by a Miss N. Simpson, near Altsigh; she judged its length to be about 30feet. Then she saw it swim underwater to the centre of the loch “at about thespeed of an outboard motor boat”.On 12 December 1933 a firm of Scottish film producers, Irvine, Clayton and Hay,managed to film the monster in motion for a few seconds; unfortunately, the filmshows little but a long dark shadow moving through the water.The most famous photograph of the monster was taken in the following April, 1934– the celebrated “surgeon’s photograph”. On 1 April 1934 Robert Kenneth Wilson,Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, was driving northward with a friend;they had leased a wildfowl shoot near Inverness, and meant to go to it and takesome photographs of the birds. Wilson had borrowed a camera with a telephotolens. It was early in the morning about seven and they stopped the car on asmall promontory two miles north of Invermoriston. As they stood watching thesurface they noticed the signs of “considerable commotion” that seem to heraldthe arrival of the monster, and the friend, Maurice Chambers, shouted, “My God,it’s the monster”. Wilson rushed to the car, came back with the camera, andmanaged to expose four plates in two minutes in such a hurry that he did noteven look at what he was photographing. The serpentine head, not unlike anelephant’s trunk, then withdrew gently into the water. Unsure as to whether hehad captured anything, Wilson hurried to Inverness and took the plates to achemist to be developed. They were ready later that day. Two proved to be blank;one showed the head about to vanish into the water. But the fourth wasexcellent, showing the dinosaur-like neck and tiny head.Wilson sold the copyright of the photograph to the Daily Mail and it appeared on21 April 1934, creating a sensation. It also aroused the usual roars of derisionfrom the scientific establishment, who branded the photograph a fake, andpointed out that the “surgeon” (who had withheld his identity) could be aninvention of the perpetrator of the fraud. In fact, Wilson soon allowed himselfto be identified, and his name appeared in Commander Gould’s book The Loch NessMonster and Others, which came out later the same year, with the “surgeon’sphotograph” as a frontispiece. (The fact that the photograph was taken on 1April may have increased the general scepticism.) Many years later anothermonster-investigator, Tim Dinsdale, held the photograph at arm’s length andnoticed something that convinced him of its authenticity. When viewed from adistance, a faint concentric circle of rings is visible around the monster,while there is another circle in the background, as if some other part of thebody is just below the surface. No one, Dinsdale pointed out, would take thetrouble to fake a detail that is almost invisible to the eye. Another piece ofevidence in favour of its authenticity emerged in 1972, when the photograph wassubjected to the computer-enhancement process at NASA; the improved pictureshowed signs of whiskers hanging down from the lower jaw.In July 1934 a team of fourteen men was hired by Sir Edward Mountain, at a wageof £2 per week per man, to spend five weeks standing on the shores of the loch,armed with cameras. Five promising photographs were taken; four of them onlyshowed a dark wake, which could have been caused by a boat; the fifth showed ahead disappearing in a splash of spray. After the watchers had been paid off,Captain James Frazer, who had been in charge of the expedition, succeeded inshooting several feet of film from a position just above Castle Urquart. Itshowed an object like an upturned, flat-bottomed boat, about fifteen feet long;it disappeared in a spume of spray. Zoologists who viewed the film said that thecreature was a seal. Captain Frazer later admitted that he had to endure a greatdeal of ridicule.Sightings continued, and more photographs were taken; but the general public hadceased to be deeply interested in the monster. After the initial excitement,most people were willing to accept the view of sceptics that the monster hadbeen a cynical invention of people involved in the Highland tourist business; ifso, it had certainly succeeded, for Loch Ness hotels were crowded throughout thesummer. One of the most interesting sightings of 1934 went virtually unnoticed.On 26 May Brother Richard Horan, of St Benedict’s Abbey, was working in theabbey boathouse when he heard a noise in the water, and saw the monster lookingat him from a distance of about thirty yards. It had a graceful neck with abroad white stripe down its front, and a muzzle like a seal’s. Three otherpeople corroborated his sighting. In the December of the following year, a MissRena Mackenzie also saw the monster fairly close, and noted that its head seemedtiny, and that the underside of its throat was white. A man named John Maclean,who saw the monster in July 1938, saw the head and neck only twenty yards away,and said that it was obviously in the act of swallowing food, opening andclosing its mouth, and tossing back its head “in exactly the same manner that acormorant does after it has swallowed a fish”. When the creature dived Macleanand his wife saw two humps. They described it as being about eighteen feet long,and said that at close quarters its skin was dark brown and “like that of ahorse when wet and glistening”. Each of these sightings enables us to form aclearer picture of the monster. And in July 1958 the water bailiff Alex Campbellhad a sighting which confirmed something he had believed for many years – thatthere must be more than one of the creatures; he saw one lying quietly near StBenedict’s Abbey while another (visible as a large black hump) headed across theloch, churning the surface of the water. (Many accounts indicate that theanimals can move at high speed.)During the Second World War interest in the monster (or monsters) waned,although sightings continued to be reported. In 1943 Commander Russell Flint, incharge of a motor launch passing through Loch Ness on its way to Swansea,reported a tremendous jolt that convinced the crew that they had struck somefloating debris. In fact, they saw the monster disappearing in a flurry ofwater. His signal to the Admiralty, reporting that he had sustained damage tothe starboard bow after a collision with the Loch Ness monster, earned him inresponse “a bit of a blast”.In November 1950 the Daily Herald ran a story headed “The Secret of Loch Ness”,alleging that dozens of eight-foot-diameter mines had been anchored on the floorof the loch since 1918, some at a depth of a mile. (The Herald stated that atits greatest depth, the loch is seven miles deep.) The story apparently had someslight basis in fact; mines had been laid in 1918 by HMS Welbeck – Hugh Gray,who later took the first monster photograph, was on board – but when a vesselwent to collect them in 1922, only the anchors remained. The mines, which weredesigned to have a life of only a few years, were probably at the bottom.Certainly none of the photographs looks in the least like an eight-foot mine,even one with horns.In the following year another monster photograph was taken by a woodsman namedLachlan Stuart. He was about to milk a cow early on 14 July 1951 when he sawsomething moving fast down the loch, so fast that he at first thought it was aspeedboat. He grabbed his camera, rushed down the hill, and snapped the monsterwhen it was only fifty yards offshore. The result was a photograph showing threedistinct humps.Four years later a bank manager named Peter Macnab was on his way back from aholiday in the north of Scotland, and pulled up his car just above UrquhartCastle. It was a calm, warm afternoon – 29 July 1955 – and he saw a movement inthe still water near the castle; he hastily raised his camera, and took aphotograph which has joined the “surgeon’s photograph” and the Lachlan Stuartphotograph as one of the classic views of the monster. But he was so anxious toavoid ridicule that he released the picture only three years later, in 1958.Before that happened, interest in the case had been revived by the best book onit so far – More Than a Legend, published in 1957. The author was ConstanceWhyte, wife of the manager of the Caledonian canal, who became interested in themonster after she was asked to write an article about it for a small localmagazine. Mrs Whyte interviewed every witness she could find, and produced thefirst overall survey of the evidence since Rupert Gould’s book of 1934. MoreThan a Legend aroused widespread interest, the author was deluged withcorrespondence, and once again the Loch Ness monster was news. What Mrs Whytehad done, with her careful research, was to refute the idea that the monster wasa joke, or the invention of the Scottish Tourist Board. No one who reads herbook can end with the slightest doubt that the monster really exists, and thatit shows itself with a fair degree of frequency.The immediate result was a new generation of “monster-hunters”. One of these,Frank Searle, was a manager for a firm of fruiterers in London; he boughtConstance Whyte’s book, and in 1958 decided to camp by Loch Ness. From then onhe returned again and again. In June 1965 he was parked in a lay-by nearInvermoriston and chatting to some hitch-hikers when he saw a dark object breakthe surface, and realized he had at last seen the monster. His excitement was sogreat that in 1969 he gave up his job and pitched his tent by Loch Ness, wherehe was to remain for the next four years. In August 1971 he saw the tail atclose quarters as the monster dived; his impression was of an alligator’s tail,“seven feet long, dark and nobbly on top, smooth dirty white underneath”. InNovember 1971 he got his first photograph of the monster – a dark hump in aswirl of water; he admitted that it was “inconclusive”. But in the followingfive years he obtained at least ten of the best pictures of the monster taken sofar, including one showing the swanlike neck rising out of the water, andanother showing both the neck and one of the humps; these were published in hisNessie: Seven Years in Search of the Monster in 1976. During that time his tenthad become a “Mecca for visitors” – mostly directed to him by the ScottishTourist Board – and in 1975 he estimated that he had seen twenty-five thousandin eight months. On 7 June 1974, together with a girl visitor from Quebec, hehad a memorable sighting. As they approached a barbed-wire fence near Foyers,they noticed a splashing sound. They crept up and peered over the fence, “andsaw two of the strangest little creatures I’ve ever seen. They were about twofeet in length, dark grey in colour, something like the skin of a baby elephant,small heads with black protruding eyes, long necks and plump bodies. They hadsnake like tails which were wrapped along their sides, and on each side of thebody, two stump-like appendages”. When he tried to get through the fence thesmall creatures “scuttled away with a kind of crab-like motion” and weresubmerged in the loch within seconds.But in his book The Loch Ness Story – perhaps the best comprehensive account ofthe hunt for the monster – Nicholas Witchell comments: “It is a regrettable factwhich can easily be proved that these 1972 photographs have been tampered with.Mr Searle has also produced another series identical with the original shots inall respects except that an extra hump has been added to them by some process ofsuper-imposition or by rephotography”. And he adds: “Because of the highlysuspicious content of some of Mr Searle’s photographs and the inconsistencies ofthe facts surrounding the taking of them, it is not possible to accept them asbeing authentic photographs of animate objects in Loch Ness”.In 1959 an aeronautical engineer named Tim Dinsdale read an article about themonster in a magazine called Everybody’s, and was intrigued. He spent most ofthat winter reading everything he could find; it was in the following Februarythat (as already described) he looked at the surgeon’s photograph, and noticedthe circle of ripples that convinced him that it was genuine. In April that yearDinsdale went off to Loch Ness to hunt the monster. But after five days he hadstill seen nothing. On the day before he was due to return home he wasapproaching his hotel in Foyers when he saw something out in the loch; hisbinoculars showed a hump. He snatched his 16-mm ciné-camera and began to film asthe creature swam away. Then, almost out of film, he drove down to the water’sedge; by the time he got there the creature had vanished. But Dinsdale had fiftyfeet of film showing the monster in motion. When shown on television it arousedwidespread interest and – as Witchell says – heralded a new phase in the saga ofthe monster.That June the first scientific expedition to Loch Ness embarked on a month-longinvestigation, with thirty student volunteers and a Marconi echo-sounder, aswell as a large collection of cameras. A ten-foot hump was sighted in July, andthe echo-sounder tracked some large object as it dived from the surface to adepth of sixty feet and back up again. The expedition also discovered largeshoals of char at a depth of a hundred feet – an answer to sceptics who saidthat the loch did not contain enough fish to support a monster; the team’sfinding was that there was enough fish to support several.But Dr Denys Tucker, of the British Museum of Natural History, who had organizedthis expedition, did not lead it as he had intended to; in June he was dismissedfrom his job – as he believed, because he had publicly expressed his belief inthe existence of the monster.Dinsdale became a close friend of Torquil MacLeod, who had seen the monsteralmost out of the water in February 1960. MacLeod had watched it for nineminutes, and admitted being “appalled by its size”, which he estimated atbetween 40 and 60 feet. It had a long neck, like an elephant’s trunk, which keptmoving from side to side and up and down, and “paddles” at the rear and front.In August 1960 MacLeod had another sighting from the shore, while a family in amotor yacht belonging to a company director, R.H. Lowrie, saw the monster atclose quarters for about a quarter of an hour, taking a few photographs. At onepoint they thought the monster was heading straight for them and about tocollide; but it veered away and disappeared.It was also in August 1960 that Sir Peter Scott, founder of the Wildfowl Trust,and Richard Fitter of the Fauna Preservation Society approached the Member ofParliament David James and asked for his help in trying to get governmentassistance for a “flat-out attempt to find what exactly is in Loch Ness”. InApril 1961 a panel decided that there was a prima facie case for investigatingthe loch. The result was the formation of the Bureau for Investigating the LochNess Phenomena, a registered charity. In October 1961 two powerful searchlightsscanned the loch every night for two weeks, and on one occasion caught aneight-foot “finger like object” standing out of the water. In 1962 another teamused sonar, and picked up several “large objects”; one of these sonar recordingspreceded an appearance of the monster on the surface.In 1966 Tim Dinsdale’s film was subjected to analysis by Air Force Intelligence,which reported that the object filmed was certainly not a boat or a submarine,and by NASA’s computer-enhancement experts, who discovered that two other partsof the body also broke the surface besides the main hump.In August 1962 another “monster-hunter”, F.W. (“Ted”) Holiday, parked his van byLoch Ness, on the southern shore opposite Urquhart Castle. As darkness fell hehad a feeling that “Loch Ness is not a water by which to linger”. Two nightslater, on a perfectly still night, he heard the crash of waves breaking on thestony beach, although there was no sound of a boat engine. Two days later he hadhis first sighting of the monster. On a hill close to the spot where Dinsdalehad taken his 1961 film, he suddenly saw a black and glistening object risethree feet out of the water; then it dived like “a diving hippopotamus”. Hecould still see the shape of the animal just below the surface. He judged it tobe about 45 feet long. Then a man on a nearby pier started hammering, and thecreature vanished.Every year from then on Holiday returned to the loch; but in 1963 and 1964 hewas unlucky. Then in 1965 he saw it on two occasions; on the first he saw it(looking like an upturned boat) from three different positions as he raced hiscar along the loch to get a better view. But he had already reached a conclusionabout the nature of the monster, that it was simply a giant version of thecommon garden slug, an ancestor of the squid and octopus. In his book The GreatOrm of Loch Ness he argued that the monster is a type of Tullimonstrumgregarium, a creature looking a little like a submarine with a broad tail. Healso came to believe that these monsters were once far more plentiful in theBritish Isles, that they used to be known as “worms” (or “orms”), and that theygave rise to the legend of dragons. A photograph in the book shows the Worm’sHead peninsula in South Wales, and argues that it is so called because itresembles the “orm” of legend and of Loch Ness.In 1963 Holiday interviewed two fishermen who had seen the monster at closerange, only 20 or 30 yards away. One said that the head reminded him of abulldog, that it was wide and very ugly. The neck was fringed by what lookedlike coarse black hair. In a letter to Dinsdale, Holiday remarked: “When peopleare confronted by this fantastic animal at close quarters they seemed to bestunned. There is something strange about Nessie that has nothing to do withsize or appearance. Odd, isn’t it”? He was intrigued by the number of people whohad a feeling of horror when they saw the monster. Why were dragons and “orms”always linked with powers of evil in medieval mythology? He also began to feelincreasingly that it was more than coincidence that the monsters were so hard tophotograph: he once had his finger on the button when the head submerged. Eitherthe monsters had some telepathic awareness of human observation or they wereassociated with some kind of Jungian “synchronicity”, or meaningful coincidence.Holiday, who was a fishing correspondent, had also had a number of sightings ofUFOs (or Flying Saucers), and one or two close brushes with “poltergeists” (or“banging ghosts”). And he was intrigued to learn that Boleskine House, nearFoyers, had been tenanted by the notorious “magician” Aleister Crowley in theearly years of the twentieth century, and that Crowley had started to performthere a lengthy magical ritual by a certain Abramelin the Mage. Crowley himselfclaimed that the house was filled with shadowy spirits while he was performingthe ritual (which takes many months), and that they drove a coachman to drinkand a clairvoyant to become a prostitute. Crowley failed to complete the ritual,and, according to Holiday “misfortune stalked him” from then on. Although henever says so in so many words, Holiday seemed to entertain the suspicion thatthe monster may have been conjured up by Crowley: certainly he thought it acoincidence that a creature associated with evil should be seen so often fromFoyers, near Boleskine House. He also thought it odd when American studentsexploring the cemetery near Boleskine found a tapestry and a conch shell beneatha grave slab. The tapestry – probably Turkish in origin – had “worm likecreatures” embroidered on it, and its freedom from mildew suggested that it hadbeen hidden recently. Holiday suspected that it had been used in some magicalceremony, and that the ceremony had been hastily abandoned when someone walkedinto the churchyard. It looked as if black magic is still practised nearBoleskine House.Soon after this Holiday went to have dinner with a friend near Loch Ness, andmet an American called Dr Dee, who was in England looking up his family tree. DrDee said that he had discovered that he had a celebrated Elizabethan ancestor ofthe same name. It was another coincidence: John Dee, the Elizabethan “magician”,had published the ritual of Abramelin the Mage.In a letter to me in 1971 Ted Holiday described a further coincidence. Lookingacross the loch, he found himself looking at the word DEE in large yellowletters. Bulldozers engaged in road-widening had scraped away the soil runningdown to the loch, and the top half of the “letters” was formed by the yellowsubsoil. The bottom half of the letters was formed by the reflection of the tophalf in the perfectly still water.In fact Holiday was coming to a very strange conclusion about lake monsters; itarose from some investigations he had undertaken in Ireland in 1968, where moremonsters had been sighted in lochs (or “loughs”) in Galway. The sightingssounded very much like those of “Nessie”, and the witnesses were ofunimpeachable reputation – on one occasion, two priests. Yet after weeks ofcareful observation, and even an attempt to “net” a monster in Lough Nahooin,Holiday had failed to obtain the slightest bit of evidence for the monsters.What puzzled him was that these Irish lakes were too small to support afifteen-foot monster, still less a colony of them. He began to wonder whetherthe peiste (as the Irish called the creature) was a thing of flesh and blood.Jung had suggested that UFOs are a “projection” from the human unconscious,modern man’s attempt to recreate lost religious symbols. Could it be, Holidaywondered, that the lake monsters are also some kind of “projection”?By 1971 Holiday had abandoned the notion that the lake monsters are simply“prehistoric survivals”. He was coming round to the admittedly eccentric viewthat there is some influence at work that actively prevents the final solutionof the mystery, just as in the case of Unidentified Flying Objects. And sometime in 1972 this view seemed to be confirmed when he read a newspapercontroversy between an “exorcist”, the Rev. Donald Omand, and some opponent whothought the Loch Ness monster was simply an unidentified animal. Omand hadinherited “second sight” from Highland ancestors, and had no doubt of the realexistence of powers of evil – or at least of mischief; he often performedexorcisms to get rid of them. He had caught his first glimpse of a lake monsterin Loch Long in Ross-shire in 1967. In June 1968, in a boat in Norway’s Fjord ofthe Trolls, he saw another, which came straight towards them; the Norwegiancaptain who was with him told him not to be afraid: “It will not hurt us – theynever do”. And in fact the monster dived before it reached their boat. But theCaptain, Jan Andersen, was convinced that the monsters were basically evil, thatin some way they could do harm to men’s characters (or, as Omand would havesaid, their souls). In 1972 Omand attended a psychiatric conference at which aneminent Swedish psychiatrist read a paper on the monster of Lake Storsjön, andsaid that he was convinced that the monsters had a malevolent effect on humanbeings, especially those who hunted them or saw them regularly. He thought theirinfluence could cause domestic tragedies and moral degeneration. So Omand beganto consider the theory that perhaps lake monsters are not real creatures, but“projections” of something from the prehistoric past.Holiday wrote to Omand, and the odd result was that in June 1973 Holiday andDonald Omand rowed out into the middle of Loch Ness, and Omand performed anexorcism of the loch. Holiday said they both felt oddly exhausted when it wasover. And his suspicion that he was stirring up dangerous forces seemed to beconfirmed two days later when he went to stay the night with a retired WingCommander named Carey. Holiday was telling Mrs Carey about a Swedish journalistcalled Jan-Ove Sundberg who had been wandering through the woods behind Foyerswhen he had seen a strange craft in a clearing, and some odd-looking men; thecraft had taken off at a great speed, and after his return to Sweden, Sundberghad been plagued by “men in black” – people claiming to be officials who oftenseem to harass UFO “contactees”.Holiday said he intended to go and look at the place where the “UFO” had landed,and Mrs Carey warned him against it. At this moment there was a rushing soundlike a tornado outside the window and a series of violent thuds; a beam of lightcame in through the window, and focused on Holiday’s forehead. A moment later,all was still. The odd thing was that Wing Commander Carey, who had been pouringa drink only a few feet away from his wife, saw and heard nothing. The nextmorning, as Holiday was walking towards the loch he saw a man dressed entirelyin black – including helmet and goggles – standing nearby; he walked past him,turned his head, and was astonished to find that the man had vanished. He rushedto the road and looked in both directions; there was nowhere the man could havegone. One year later, close to the same spot, Holiday had a heart attack; as hewas being carried away he looked over the side of the stretcher and saw thatthey were just passing the exact spot where he had seen the “man in black”. Fiveyears later, Holiday died of a heart attack.Perhaps a year before his death, Ted Holiday sent me the typescript of his bookThe Goblin Universe, in which he attempted to justify the rather strange viewshe had gradually developed since starting his hunt for the Loch Ness monster. Hehad already discussed them in his second book The Dragon and the Disc, in whichhe linked UFOs (“discs”) and “worms” as symbols of good and evil. Then, to mysurprise, he changed his mind about publishing the book.There were, I suspect, two reasons. The team of investigators from the Academyof Applied Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, led by DrRobert H. Rines, had taken some remarkable underwater photographs in 1972 and1975; one of the 1972 photographs showed very clearly an object like a largeflipper, perhaps eight feet long, while a 1975 photograph showed very clearly along-necked creature and its front flipper; this was particularly impressivebecause the sonar evidence – waves of sound reflected back from the creature –made it clear that this was not some freak of the light or piece of floatingwreckage or lake-weed. By the time he was thinking about publishing The GoblinUniverse, Holiday was probably wondering whether the book would be contradictedby some new evidence that would establish the physical reality of the monsterbeyond all doubt. Apart from this, the argument of The Goblin Universe was notquite as rigorous as it might be – he was attempting to explain why his viewshad changed so startlingly since 1962, and spent a great deal of time dwellingon “the paranormal”. At all events, he decided not to publish the book, andinstead wrote another typescript confined to lake monsters. (The Goblin Universewas recently published in America.)This account of Holiday’s activities may seem to be something of a digression;yet it illustrates the immense frustration experienced by monster-hunters in the1970s and 1980s. When Gould wrote his book in 1934 the solution of the problemseemed close; then it receded. Constance Whyte’s book revived interest in themystery, and when the Loch Ness Phenomena Investigation Bureau began toco-operate with the team from the Academy of Applied Science, and to use all thelatest scientific equipment, it began to look as if the mystery was about to besolved once and for all. Yet at the time of this writing – eleven years afterthat remarkable underwater picture of the monster – there has still been nomajor advance. Nicholas Witchell triumphantly concludes his book The Loch NessStory.(1975) with a chapter entitled “The Solution”, in which he describes hisexcitement when Rines telephoned him from America to describe the colourphotograph of the monster; it contains the sentence: “With the officialratification of the discovery of the animals in Loch Ness, the world will loseone of its most popular mysteries”. And he declares that it would be ignoble nowto gloat about the short-sightedness of the scientific establishment for itssceptical attitude towards Loch Ness.It is now clear that Witchell was premature. Most people still regard thequestion of the monster’s existence as an open one, and the majority ofscientists still regard the whole thing as something of a joke. In 1976 RoyMackal, a director of the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau and Professor ofBiochemistry at the University of Chicago, published the most balanced andthoroughgoing scientific assessment so far, The Monsters of Loch Ness. He turnsa highly critical eye on the evidence, yet nevertheless concludes that it is nowproven that “a population of moderate-sized, piscivorous aquatic animals isinhabiting Loch Ness”. If the scientific establishment was willing to change itsmind, this book should have changed it; yet it seems to have made no realimpact.One thing seems clear: that Holiday’s pessimism about the monster wasunjustified; even at the time he was writing The Dragon and the Disc, Rines wastaking the best underwater photographs of the monster so far. So there seemsreason to believe that science will finally solve the problem of establishingits existence beyond all doubt. The problems of capturing the monster either onfilm or in nets are epitomized in the following description by Dennis Stacy, ofSan Antonio, Texas, of his own encounter with “Nessie”.> In 1972 I went to the Loch with the express purpose of looking for Nessie. The> idea was to camp along the shoreline for about two weeks and see what was to> be seen. I had a very distinct feeling of confidence that if I went to the> Loch I would see Nessie. I met some students on vacation from Oxford and> stayed with them just above Drumnadrochit. Every day I would take my camera> down to the shoreline and have a good look around. Except for the day it was> cold and drizzly and all of us went for a walk in the pinewoods there. A girl> student and myself soon wandered off on our own from the others and made it> down to the lochside. While we had been under the pines, the sky cleared> remarkably and the wind died down. By the time we reached the loch, it was> completely still and mirror-like. About three quarters of a mile across the> loch, nearly under Crowley/Page’s Boleskine, was Nessie, showing about six> feet of neck and head above the water. We had jumped up on the little low rock> wall skirting the road. We both saw it at the same time and nearly caused each> other to tumble over the side by grabbing the other’s shoulders and pointing> and saying, Look! Do you see what I see?> > And my camera, a 35mm, was miles away. My companion, however, had a little> small, cheap camera, and the presence of mind to take a shot. All that was> visible in the picture was a white wake, about a hundred feet in length, left> by Nessie (or whatever), and which showed up clearly against the dark> reflection of the trees on the other side in the water.> > Nessie herself? The head was definitely angular, as described. Some say like a> horse, with the very pronounced wedge-shape. In my own experience, I liken it> to the shape of a rattlesnake’s head, a square snout running back in a flare> to the jaws. The length of neck out of the water, including the head, was five> or six feet. The impression it gave, in the sense that spiders and snakes seem> to exude their own peculiar aura, was one not so much of danger as power. I> mean it was really cutting a wake through the water, raising a little wavelet> on either side of the neck. At times the head was lowered down and forward,> and would sweep a small angle from side to side, as if feeding, by lowering> the bottom part of the jaw just into the water. But it was really too far away> to be absolutely certain of this last manoeuver; the head, however, could be> very plainly seen swinging from side to side.> > It was swimming thusly when we first saw it and after no more than a minute,> simply sank lower and lower in the water, much in the same way a person comes> down from a round of water-skiing, or a submarine submerges. (Letter to the> author, 20 Sept 1980.)> > Holiday might point out that some points in this narrative seem to support hisown quasi-Jungian views. Dennis Stacy expected to see the monster. But he didnot see it while he was patrolling the lake with his camera; it happenedaccidentally on a day he had decided to take off from his vigil. It certainlysounds as if the monster is playing some Jungian game of hide-and-seek. Yet allof us have experienced that same feeling that certain days are lucky or unlucky– everything seems to go right or everything seems to go wrong – and commonsense tells us that this is purely subjective; an attitude of pessimism makes uscareless and therefore accident-prone; an attitude of optimism awakens a newlevel of vigilance that anticipates problems.What seems perfectly clear from Stacy’s narrative (and many others quoted in theforegoing pages) is that the creatures of Loch Ness appear above the surfacefairly frequently, particularly on calm days. If science can devise methods ofdetecting the presence of aeroplanes or jet-propelled missiles in the skies, andof submarines under the sea, it should surely be a simple matter to design asystem that would detect all objects that move on the surface of Loch Ness on acalm day, and to film them? In these days of laser beams and electronicsurveillance, it seems absurd that we should have to wait for chance sightingsof the monster, like the one described above. It should also be obvious thatattempts to “hunt” it with motor launches, submarines, helicopters andsearchlights are self-defeating, since they create exactly the kind ofdisturbance that drives the creature(s) to hide in the depths of the loch.When the “monster” is finally identified and classified it will undoubtedly besomething of an anticlimax, and Loch Ness will probably lose most of its touristindustry at a blow. Half the fascination of the monster lies in the notion thatit is terrifying and dangerous. In fact all the evidence suggests that like thatother legendary marauder the “killer” whale, it will turn out to be shy, amiableand quite harmless to man.Postscript to “The Loch Ness Monster” In March 1994 it was revealed that one of the most famous photographs of theLoch Ness Monster, the so-called “surgeon’s photograph”, was a hoax. Asdescribed in the above article, the photograph was taken in April 1934 (the 19th– not, as stated above, the 1st) by a eminent Harley Street gynaecologistColonel Robert Wilson, who claimed he was driving towards Inverness when afriend who was in the car shouted: “My God, it’s the monster” and Wilson tookfour photographs with a plate camera.The true story, apparently, begins several months earlier, and concerns aself-styled big game hunter and self-publicist called Marmaduke ArundelWetherell. He had been hired to track down the monster by The Daily Mail. On 18December 1933, Wetherell went to Scotland with a Daily Mail photographer, andforty-eight hours after arriving, claimed that he had found two footprints ofthe monster on the south shore near Fort Augustus. The “spoor” was, he declared,“less than a few hours old”. It was “a four fingered beast, and it has feet orpads about eight inches across, a very powerful soft-footed animal about twentyfeet long”.Plaster casts were taken of the footprints and sent to the Natural HistoryMuseum, but on 4 January it was announced that the footprints were those of ayoung hippo. It was probable, said the expert, that the foot was in usesomewhere as an umbrella stand. Understandably, Wetherell was upset by the galeof derision that greeted this announcement. The Loch Ness story ceased to befront-page news.And then, three months later, came the “surgeon’s photograph”, and the laughterdied away.What no one knew is that the photograph was also the work of Duke Wetherell.Colonel Robert Wilson was the friend of a man called Maurice Chambers, inassociation with whom he leased a wildfowl shoot on the Beauly Firth, nearInverness. And Chambers was also a friend of Duke Wetherell.Another important clue was never revealed to the public – that Colonel Wilsonwas extremely fond of a practical joke.The true story of the “surgeon’s photograph” began to emerge in December, 1975,when a diary story in The Sunday Telegraph reported that Wetherell’s son Ianclaimed he and his father had fabricated a photograph of the Loch Ness Monster.The article did not specify which photograph, but it named Maurice Chambers as acoconspirator.David Martin, a zoologist with the Loch Ness and Morar Scientific Project, andAlistair Boyd, a fellow researcher, recalled reading that Chambers was a friendof Duke Wetherell.At the time of the diary piece, Ian Wetherell was sixty-three and running aChelsea pub. But when Martin and Boyd arrived at the pub eighteen years later,he was dead.The trail then led to Duke Wetherell’s stepson, living on the south coast and inpoor health. Christian Spurling was then close to ninety, and he was willing totell the whole story.When Duke Wetherell returned from Scotland to his home in Twickenham in January1934, he was furious with The Daily Mail, which had made it clear what itthought of his hippopotamus footprints. “All right”, he told his son Ian, “We’llgive them their monster”.Ian, twenty-one, was sent out to buy the raw materials – a toy submarine andsome tins of plastic wood. His step-brother Christian, the son of a marinepainter, was a keen model maker. He received a message from Wetherell saying“can you make me a monster”?Spurling made a small monster of plastic wood with a long neck and a head like adinosaur. The neck was built over the conning tower of the toy submarine,leaving a space for the clockwork key. A piece of lead was soldered underneathto prevent it from capsizing. The model was tested out on the local pond, andthen Duke Wetherell and his son returned to Loch Ness, found a quiet day, andfloated the “monster” out into the shallows. It was Ian who took thephotographs.What Wetherell now needed was someone “respectable” who would be willing toclaim he had taken the photographs.Chambers’ friend Colonel Robert Wilson entered into the spirit of the thing,took the four photographic plates to a chemist shop in Inverness, and announcedthat he had photographed the Loch Ness Monster.In the storm of publicity that followed, the British Medical Association toldColonel Wilson that the story was likely to bring his profession into disrepute,whereupon Wilson began to drop hints that he could not talk to anyone else abouthis sighting because the companion who had shouted: “My God, it’s the monster”was a married woman with whom he was having an affair.Wilson died in Australia in 1969, and Duke Wetherell and Chambers died in themid-1950s. Christian Spurling died in November 1993, after recording the story.As to the toy submarine, it is presumably still somewhere in Loch Ness – whenthey had photographed “the monster” they heard a water bailiff approaching, andDuke Wetherell put his foot out and sank it.An equally interesting development in the Loch Ness story came to light in April1999, through another “hunter” of strange anomalies called Erik Beckjord.As mentioned in the article above, one of the most eminent investigators of theLoch Ness Monster was the aeronautical engineer Tim Dinsdale, who becamefascinated after reading an article about the monster in a magazine calledEverybody’s Weekly. Dinsdale filmed some of the best-known footage of themonster, and became widely known for his theory that it was some kind ofdinosaur – a plesiosaurus. This was in 1959.But twenty-four years later, Erik Beckjord learned from Dinsdale himself that heno longer believed his own theory.Beckjord describes how he was on his way to a canal-barge holiday with hisgirlfriend Kathy Quint when he stopped in Reading, where Tim Dinsdale lived.They went for a drink in a nearby pub, and Dinsale confided to Beckjord that hiswife had her reservations about his fame as a monster hunter.The problem, it seemed, was that Dinsdale had become totally convinced that theLoch Ness Monster was a ghost. Ted Holiday, he admitted, had been right allalong.He told Beckjord how, through many long nights watching the Loch, he hadexperienced a number of paranormal (or abnormal) happenings and becameincreasingly certain that he was dealing with some aspect of the supernatural.Apparently what convinced him beyond doubt was a night when he anchored hissmall cruiser off Boleskine House, where the magician Aleister Crowley hadperformed the occult ritual of Abrahamelin the Mage seventy years earlier, andthat, according to Dinsdale’s account, “he endured a series of ghosts, ghoulies,‘demons,’ crawling into his boat and coming at him. They never harmed himphysically, but they finally killed off the plesiosaur idea for him”. He wasabsolutely certain that these were not fatigue-hallucinations, but real events.He now realized he was faced with a dilemma. A large part of his income camefrom his books and lectures on the monster. His audiences would simply not wantto hear his theory that the monster was somehow “supernatural”. Financially,this would be a disaster. He would also be labelled a “nut”. Altogether, itwould be better to keep silent.So, according to Beckjord, Dinsdale hid his knowledge from his publishers andhis audiences, but at least he confided in a number of researchers.When, in the mid-1980s, Beckjord pressed him to make plans for his estate,Dinsdale said it was all taken care of. Beckjord himself became totallyconvinced that the Loch Ness Monster was somehow paranormal, and found that hewas shunned by traditional researchers at Loch Ness. In 1987, Beckjord attendedthe International Society of Cryptozoology in Edinburgh, and was not evenallowed to speak at the main conference. However, he showed a 16mm film afterthe sessions were over and many people agreed that it showed a white,shape-shifting thing that was not a reptile. Tim Dinsdale was there and saw thefilm, but said nothing to Beckjord. But Dr Jack Gibson, co-sponsor of themeeting, told Beckjord in a voice that could be overheard by Dinsdale that thefilm was “the most important he had ever seen of Nessie”.Six months later, Dinsdale died at the age of sixty-seven."},{"pageContent":"32 The Man in the Iron MaskOn 19 November 1703 a masked prisoner died in the Bastille after a briefillness. He had been imprisoned for thirty-four years, and even the king’sLieutenant in the Bastille, Etienne du Jonca, did not know his identity. He madea note in his journal: “I have since learnt that they called him M. deMarchiel”. The unknown prisoner was buried the day after his death, under thename of Marchioly, and was quickly forgotten.He became famous nearly half a century later, as a result of a book by Voltaire,The Century of Louis XIV, in which Voltaire finally exposed the mystery of the“man in the iron mask”. According to Voltaire, a few months after the death ofCardinal Mazarin (which occurred in 1661), a young prisoner wearing an iron mask– or rather, a mask whose chin was composed of steel springs, so he could eatwithout removing it – was taken to the prison on the Ile Sainte Marguerite.Orders were given to kill him if he removed the mask. This prisoner, “ofmajestic height . . . of a graceful and noble figure”, was allowed to haveanything he desired. His greatest pleasure was fine linen and laces. He wasobviously a man of high rank, for the governor seldom sat down in his presence.Even the doctor who attended him was never allowed to see his face. The strangerdied in 1704, said Voltaire (getting the date wrong by a year), and the strangething is that when first he was incarcerated on the Isle of St Marguerite noperson of any rank disappeared in Europe. According to Voltaire, the mysteriousprisoner once scratched something on a plate, which he threw out of a window ofhis prison. It was picked up by a fisherman, who took it to the prison governor.“Have you read what is written on it”? asked the governor. The fishermanconfessed that he was unable to read. “You are lucky”, said the governor . . .Voltaire’s story created a sensation. There had been rumours about a maskedprisoner, but no one had ever dared to speak about them openly. In fact a ratherabsurd novel called The Iron Mask, by the Chevalier de Mouhy, had been bannedfive years earlier, although its story took place in Spain and it bore noresemblance to the true story of the masked prisoner.But who was the masked prisoner, and what had he done? Twenty years later, inQuestions on the Encyclopedia, Voltaire revealed the answer or what he believedto be the answer. To understand his story, we must know a little of Frenchhistory. King Louis XIII was rumoured to be impotent, and was in any case on badterms with his wife, Anne of Austria. Anne was far closer to the king’s greatminister Cardinal Mazarin; politically they were hand in glove, and it is fairlycertain that he was her lover; she may even have secretly married him after thedeath of the king. This then was Voltaire’s theory: that Anne of Austria boreMazarin a son, and that this happened before the birth of Louis XIV; the child,naturally, was kept secret from the king. So Louis XIV had an elder brother, whomight have challenged his right to the throne. Which is why Louis kept hisbrother in prison, his face concealed by a mask, in case the family resemblancegave him away . . .Nearly a century after Voltaire’s “revelation”, in 1847, Alexandre Dumaspublished his famous novel The Man in the Iron Mask, one of the many sequels toThe Three Musketeers. This became by far the most famous account of the mystery,and was the basis of the popular Hollywood film. According to Dumas, the unknownprisoner was the twin brother of Louis XIV. This was not Dumas’s own theory; itwas first put forward in a work called Memoires of the Duc de Richelieu,published in London in 1790. This work claimed that Louis XIV was born at noon,and that his twin brother arrived at 8.30 in the evening, while his father wasat supper. The younger twin was hidden away, so as not to cause problems withthe succession. But these Memoirs are in fact a forgery by the Duc’s secretary,the Abbé Soulavie, so this story is probably an invention.In his introduction to an English translation of Dumas’s novel the literarycritic Sidney Dark writes:> Other wilder theories have identified the prisoner with the Duke of Monmouth,> the illegitimate son of Charles II, with a certain Armenian Patriarch, with> Fouquet, the ambitious minister of Louis XIV in his youth, who is one of the> central figures in Dumas’s novel, and, wildest guess of all, with Molière. It> is said that after the successful production of Molière’s famous comedy> Tartuffe the Jesuits persuaded Louis XIV to order his disappearance. All these> guesses are romantic and fantastic. Serious historians now hold that the Man> in the Iron Mask was an Italian called Matthiolo, a minister of the Duke of> Mantua, who aroused the enmity of Louis XIV through some obscure intrigues.> > Sidney Dark was not quite correct. The man that many scholars thought was themasked prisoner was Ercole Mattioli, who was born in 1640, and was Secretary ofState to the Duke of Mantua. The “obscure intrigue” that aroused the wrath ofLouis XIV was a piece of double-dealing. In 1632 France had bought a strongholdin Italy called Pinerolo, or Pignerol. Thirty years or so later, Louis thoughthe saw a chance to acquire another useful piece of Italian territory by the samemeans: the town and citadel of Casale, near Turin, which belonged to the Duke ofMantua. Apparently the Duke was financially embarrassed and might be willing tosell. But negotiations had to be carried out with great caution, for Louis wasquarrelling with Spain, and the Duke of Mantua was surrounded by friends ofSpain. In fact Mattioli allowed news of the proposed deal to leak out to Louis’senemies, with the result that it fell through. Louis was furious, but there wasnot much he could do about it while Mattioli was on Italian territory. First ofall, Mattioli had to be kept in the dark about the king’s anger. Next he had tobe lured to Pignerol, apparently to conclude the deal. The moment he was onFrench territory he was arrested, and thrown into goal in the fortress ofPignerol, which was in the charge of a governor named Saint-Mars. The wholething was kept secret; Mattioli simply “disappeared”, and remained in prisonuntil his death; no one knows quite when this was, but the likeliest guess isthat it was about fifteen years later, in 1694.Mattioli is certainly a likely candidate – we may recall that Etienne du Jonca,the King’s Lieutenant in the Bastille, said that the masked prisoner was knownas “M. Marchiel”; and we know he was buried as “Marchiolly”. But if Mattioli wasthe man in the mask, then why did the king go to such lengths to keep hisidentity secret, especially after he was transferred to the Island of StMarguerite, then to the Bastille? It is true that Mattioli was kidnapped inItaly, which might cause diplomatic problems. But in that pragmatic age, no onewould have bothered much about Mattioli after he was imprisoned. And why hideMattioli’s face? Not many people would recognize it.Then what about the twin brother theory, which is still by far the most popularsolution to the mystery? In fact this was exploded half a century before Dumaswrote his novel. After the fall of the Bastille during the French Revolution,its archives were published under the title The Bastille Unveiled. The chairmanof the commission that investigated the archives, a certain M. Charpentier,studied every document he could lay his hands on relating to the man in the ironmask. Other royal archives were also at his disposal, and he found there was nota scrap of evidence that Anne of Austria had given birth either to anillegitimate son or to twins.But Charpentier did uncover a few interesting facts about the “ancientprisoner”, as well as one curious legend. The legend was that the man in themask was the illegitimate son of Anne of Austria by the Duke of Buckingham, thehandsome, daredevil minister of James I and Charles I. Buckingham had risen topower as the favourite of the homosexual James I, but also acquired a stronginfluence over Charles I. It is known that he did his best to seduce Anne ofAustria when he was in France in 1626, but a matter of some doubt whether hesucceeded – it would not be easy for two people as well known as they were tofind an opportunity for adultery. But according to the legend recorded by M.Charpentier, Anne bore the Duke a son in 1626 who bore a remarkable familyresemblance to her later child Louis XIV, born twelve years later – hence theneed to keep him masked . . .This legend had one strong point in its favour. It originated with a certainMadame de Saint-Quentin, who was the mistress of the Marquis de Louvois, LouisXIV’s war minister. And if (as is practically certain) she heard it from theMarquis, then surely there must be a certain amount of truth in it? That istrue; but the opposite may also be true. Perhaps the Marquis told her the storythat Louis wanted people to believe – a story that was close enough to the truthto seem probable, but that would mislead the curious. In any case, this storyalso has one major drawback. If the man in the iron mask was born in 1626, thenhe would have been about seventy-three at the time of his death. But other cluesabout the prisoner suggest that he was at least ten years younger than that.Voltaire says he was young and graceful. But by 1669 – the date at which theBastille archives revealed that the former prisoner had first been incarcerated– a man born in 1626 would have been forty-three – almost an old man in theEurope of that period.At least Charpentier was able to find a few useful clues from the archives. Theprisoner had been in Pignerol, like Mattioli, as well as on the island of StMarguerite – also like Mattioli. But it was not Mattioli. For other archivematerial revealed that when Saint-Mars, the prison governor of Pignerol, wasgiven another appointment at nearby Exiles in 1681 the “ancient prisoner” wentwith him, while Mattioli stayed behind. And as more archive material came tolight, it was discovered that various letters between the minister of war andSaint-Mars were in the file. And, more important, there were letters from theking. These proved beyond all doubt that the name of the man in the iron maskwas Eustache Dauger. In July 1669 the Marquis de Louvois (the father of the onewho told his mistress the fairy tale about the Duke of Buckingham) wrote toSaint-Mars:> The King has commanded that I am to have the man named Eustache Dauger sent to> Pignerol. It is of the utmost importance . . . that he should be securely> guarded and that he should in no way give information about himself nor send> any letters . . . You must on no account listen to what he may want to say to> you, always threatening to kill him if he opens his mouth . . .> > And the archive contained two letters from the king himself that underlined thesame point. They make one thing very plain: that Eustache Dauger knew someastonishing secret, and that the king was quite determined that no one elseshould know it. Then why not execute Dauger? Possibly because Louis XIV was notas ruthless and cruel as that; possibly because he had a certain affection forDauger. Possibly even because the king was hoping that Dauger might one dayreveal some great secret . . .It was a historian called Jules Lair who first advanced the theory that the manin the mask was Eustache Dauger; he did this in a life of the finance ministerNicholas Fouquet, who was also condemned to life imprisonment by the king.Fouquet, born in 1615, had been a protégé of Cardinal Richelieu, and whenMazarin – Richelieu’s ally and successor – died in 1661 everyone expectedFouquet to become the king’s chief minister. But the young king – he was onlytwenty-three – was sick of Fouquet, who had become immensely wealthy as a resultof his office. He may also have been jealous of Fouquet, who had tried to seduceLouise de la Vallière, the officer’s daughter who became the king’s mistress.The king appointed Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a shopkeeper’s son, assistant toFouquet, and Colbert soon reported that Fouquet was handing the king falsifiedaccounts every afternoon. Fouquet made the mistake of inviting the king to hischâteau and entertaining him with extravagant magnificence, a magnificence theking knew was bought with public money. Fouquet was arrested, tried, andsentenced to life imprisonment in the fortress of Pignerol. And in 1675 the“ancient prisoner”, Eustache Dauger, was allowed to become Fouquet’s valet.There can have been only two possible reasons. Either Fouquet already knewDauger’s secret of the “ancient prisoner”, or it did not matter if he found out,since he himself would never be released.But who was Eustache Dauger, and what had he done? The first question provedslightly easier to answer than the second. In the late 1920s the historianMaurice Duvivier set out to track him down. The doctor who had attended him inthe Bastille had mentioned his age as about sixty. That meant he must have beenborn in the late 1630s. Duvivier searched the records tirelessly for a Dauger –or D’Auger, or Danger, or Oger, or Daugé – who might fit the bill. Eventually hefound one in the records of the Bibliothèque Nationale, a man called Oger deCavoye, a member of the minor gentry of Picardy. Eustache Oger (also speltDauger) de Cavoye was the son of François de Cavoye, the captain of CardinalRichelieu’s musketeers, and he was born on 30 August 1637. He was one of sixbrothers, four of whom died in battle. The fifth, Louis Dauger de Cavoye, hadbecome one of Louis XIV’s most trusted officials. But Eustache seems to havebeen the ne’er-do-well of the family. And the more Duvivier studied him, themore certain he became that he was the man in the iron mask.Eustache’s father, François de Cavoye, went to court to seek his fortune about1620. Like Dumas’s D’Artagnan, he soon achieved celebrity for his courage.(D’Artagnan was in fact a real person, and he escorted Fouquet to Pignerolprison.) He married a young widow, Marie de Sérignan, and became the captain ofthe cardinal’s guard in 1630. Marie was extremely popular in her own right, andbecame a friend of Richelieu and of the king, and a maid of honour to the queen.So her sons were brought up at court, and the young Eustache was a playmate ofthe young Louis XIV – which seems to explain why Louis was unwilling to have himexecuted. François de Cavoye was killed at the siege of Bapaume in 1641, but hiswidow’s position ensured that the children continued to be favoured at court.But four of the brothers were to die in the army. Eustache, who was also asoldier, had served in seven campaigns by the time he was twenty-one.In 1659, when he was twenty-two, Eustache Dauger seems to have been involved inan extremely strange incident. He was present on the Good Friday of that year ata black mass in the Castle of Roissy, in which a pig was christened and eaten.The scandal was tremendous, and a number of careers were ruined, but Eustacheseems to have escaped punishment, probably because of the respect in which hismother was held at Court. But six years later he was involved in another scandalwhich forced him to resign his commission. There was some sort of quarrel with apage-boy outside the old castle of St Germain; one account (by the Ducd’Enghien) says that the page was drunk, and that he managed to strike the Ducde Foix with his pike as he staggered past him. A quarrel flared, and “a mancalled Cavoye” killed the page. This was regarded as an act of sacrilege, sincethe place was sanctified by the king’s presence. The Duc de Foix escapedunpunished, but Cavoye was forced to sell his commission. That the Cavoyereferred to was Eustache Dauger is proved by the fact that he also ceased to bea guards officer in 1665, while his two surviving brothers Louis and Armandcontinued to serve the king.Soon after the murder of the page, Eustache’s mother died, and in her willdeclared that Louis Dauger, not his elder brother Eustache, should be the headof the family. She had apparently made this will fourteen months before themurder of the page, so we can only conclude that she already regarded Eustacheas a scapegrace. She left him a pension for life of a thousand livres a year.Eustache seems to have been financially secure, and he and his brother Louisshared rooms in the Rue de Bourbon, not far from the Charity Hospital. But in1668 Louis Dauger found himself in serious trouble. He had been trying to seducea lady named Sidonia de Courcelles, whose husband objected. Louis fought a duelwith him, and was arrested. The war minister Louvois was also interested inSidonia, and he tried hard to get Louis sentenced to death. The finance ministerColbert saved him; but Louis spent the next four years in the Bastille. When heemerged he continued to rise in the world. But by then his brother Eustache wasin Pignerol.Why? What had Eustache done? Duvivier’s theory is that he had played some partin the infamous “affair of the poisons”, or rather, in a curtain-raiser to itthat occurred in 1668. The “affair of the poisons” began in 1673, when thepolice chief, Nicolas de la Reynie, heard rumours of wealthy ladies who wereadmitting in the confessional that they had poisoned their husbands. It took LaReynie four years to uncover an incredible “poisons ring” run by fortune-tellersand priests who practised the black mass. Many ladies of the court wereinvolved, and so (this came as a deep shock to the king) was Madame deMontespan, the king’s mistress. Her aim was to secure the king’s love and toweaken the influence of her rival Louise de la Vallière, and she took part in ablack mass, allowing her naked belly to be used as the altar, while a priestnamed Guibourg slit the throat of a baby. In another ceremony to concoct a lovepotion for the king, drops of a woman’s menstrual blood were mixed with a man’ssperm – the latter obtained by getting a man to masturbate into a holy chalice.All this so horrified the king that he ordered it to be investigated in theutmost secrecy in a room lit only by candles, known as the Chambre Ardente(lighted room) – and that no hint of it should be allowed to reach the public.Most of the leading figures in the affair of the poisons were burned alive. Mmede Montespan was disgraced.In 1668, five years before La Reynie heard the first hints about the poisonring, there had been another “poison scare” in Paris, and a “sorcerer” named LeSage and his assistant, the Abbé Mariette, were charged with witchcraft. Therewas much talk about love potions, black masses, and ladies of the court. Thename of Madame de Montespan was mentioned for the first time, but hastilysuppressed. Le Sage was sentenced to the galleys for life, while the AbbéMariette, who had influential relatives, escaped with nine years’ banishment.Now in the later affair of the poisons, the Abbé Guibourg admitted that he hadbeen paid to say a black mass at the home of the Duchesse d’Orléans by a surgeonwho lived in the St-Germain quarter, near the Charity Hospital, with hisbrother. This is where Eustache Dauger and his brother lived in 1668. Andanother piece of evidence from the Chambre Ardente trial referred to a surgeoncalled d’Auger, who supplied “drugs”. Duvivier speculates that this “surgeon”d’Auger was Eustache, and that it was his involvement in the Le Sage-Marietteaffair that led to his banishment. Evidence showed that Eustache Dauger had beenarrested at Dunkirk by special order of the king; he was apparently about toflee to England. So Duvivier could be right. Eustache Dauger could be thesurgeon d’Auger involved in the sorcery case. But that still fails to explainwhy the king should conduct the whole affair with such secrecy. After all, theAbbé Mariette was banished, and so had plenty of opportunity to open his mouthabout any sinister secrets he knew about the king and Dauger. Somehow Duvivier’stheory that Dauger’s crime was sorcery or selling poisons fails to carryconviction.There is another and rather more interesting possibility that links Dauger withthe mystery of Rennes-le-Château (see Chapter 44). In his book The Holy Bloodand the Holy Grail, Henry Lincoln states that Fouquet, the disgraced financeminister, may have been the man in the iron mask. This as we know is impossible;Fouquet died in 1680, twenty-three years before the “ancient prisoner”. ButLincoln also points out that in 1656 Fouquet’s brother Louis was sent to Rome tosee the painter Poussin, and that he wrote Fouquet a curious letter about somesecret which would give him “through M. Poussin, advantages which even kingswould have great pains to draw from him”. This secret is assumed to be somethingto do with the hidden treasure of Rennes-le-Château. Poussin’s painting TheShepherds of Arcady, which contains important keys to the mystery, was acquiredby Louis XIV and kept in his private rooms where no one could see it. Is itpossible that Fouquet knew the secret of Rennes-le-Château, and that the kinghad him imprisoned in Pignerol – where he was not allowed to speak to anyone –to try to force him to disclose the secret? There is yet another possibilitylinked with Rennes-le-Château. Lincoln reveals that an important part of themystery concerns a secret order called the Priory of Sion, whose aim is torestore the Merovingian dynasty to the throne of France. In the seventeenthcentury the Merovingians – descendants of King Merovech – were the house ofLorraine. The younger brother of Louis XIII, Gaston d’Orléans, was married tothe Duke of Lorraine’s sister, and there was an attempt to depose Louis and putGaston in his place – which would have meant that Gaston’s Merovingiandescendants would have been once more on the throne of France. The attemptfailed, but it was still possible that Gaston’s heirs would succeed to thethrone, since Louis XIII was childless. Then, as we know, Anne of Austriaastonished everyone by conceiving the child who became Louis XIV . . .Lincoln writes: “According to both contemporary and later writers, the child’strue father was Cardinal Richelieu, or perhaps a ‘stud’ employed by Richelieu .. .”And who could such a “stud” have been? The obvious candidate is Richelieu’shandsome young captain of musketeers, François Dauger de Cavoye. There are manystories about the conception of Louis XIV – how, for example, Richelieu plottedto bring the king and his queen together, and how Louis took refuge with Anne ofAustria during a thunderstorm, as a result of which the child was conceived. Itis of course possible that Louis XIV was conceived as a result of one singleencounter between the king and queen, but far more likely that Richelieuarranged the encounter so that Louis would have reason to believe the child washis own . . .Several writers mention the resemblance between Louis Dauger de Cavoye,Eustache’s younger brother, and Louis XIV. This would be understandable if thetwo were, in fact, half-brothers.And so at last we have a theory that seems to explain the mystery of the man inthe mask. François de Cavoye was the “stud” who made sure that an heir to thethrone was born, thus frustrating the aspirations of the Merovingians (and thePriory of Sion). Eustache and Louis Dauger both knew that the king was reallytheir half-brother; this is why Louis became a royal favourite after his releasefrom the Bastille. He could be relied upon to keep a secret. But thene’er-do-well Eustache was a different story. After his downfall, hisresignation from the guards, and the arrest and imprisonment of his brother, hebegan to talk too much. Perhaps he tried some form of blackmail on the king:release my brother or else . . . That would certainly explain why Louis had himwhisked away to Pignerol and kept incommunicado, and why he later made sure thatthe “ancient prisoner” always accompanied the governor Saint-Mars when he movedto another prison. It is also conceivable that Eustache became involved with thePriory of Sion and the plot to place a Merovingian on the throne of France –after all, what better reason could there be for replacing the king thanrevealing that he was not the true son of Louis XIII? Fouquet probably knew thesecret already, since he also seems to have had connection with the Priory.(Lincoln speculates that this is why Fouquet was arrested and tried; Louis triedhard to have Fouquet sentenced to death, but the court refused.) That is whyEustache was allowed to become Fouquet’s valet. But when another oldacquaintance of Dauger’s, the Duc de Lauzun, was imprisoned in Pignerol after anescapade, he and Dauger were carefully kept apart.This theory could explain many things. It could explain, for example, why thewar minister Louvois (who undoubtedly knew the secret) told his mistress thatthe masked prisoner was the son of the Duke of Buckingham and Anne of Austria.It was not too far from the truth; it explained why the king should want to keepthe prisoner’s existence a secret; but it made the prisoner the illegitimatechild rather than the king. It would also explain why Dauger was obliged to weara mask when other people were around: like his brother, he probably resembledthe king. It is almost impossible to imagine why a man should be obliged to weara mask unless his face itself is an important key to his secret.It must be admitted that there is also one strong objection to this theory. WhenKing Louis XV was finally told the secret of the man in the mask by his regent,the Duc d’Orléans, he is reported to have exclaimed, “If he were still alive Iwould give him his freedom”. Would the king really have thought it unimportantthat his grandfather was the son of Richelieu’s captain of musketeers? Perhaps;after all, his own throne was now secure. But there is another story of Louis XVthat casts rather more doubt on the theory. When the Duc de Choiseul asked himabout the mysterious prisoner he refused to say anything except: “Allconjectures which have been made hitherto are false”. Then he added a bafflingafterthought: “If you knew all about it, you would see that it has very littleinterest”. If this comment is true – and not simply an attempt to allay theduke’s curiosity – then it suggests that all the thousands of pages that havebeen written about the man in the iron mask are “much ado about nothing”."},{"pageContent":"33 The Mystery of the Mary CelesteOn a calm afternoon of 5 December 1872 the English ship Dei Gratia sighted atwo-masted brig pursuing an erratic course in the North Atlantic, midway betweenthe Azores and the coast of Portugal. As they came closer they could see thatshe was sailing with only her jib and foretop mast staysail set; moreover, thejib was set to port, while the vessel was on a starboard tack – a sure sign toany sailor that the ship was out of control. Captain Morehouse of the Dei Gratiasignalled the mysterious vessel, but received no answer. The sea was runninghigh after recent squalls, and it took a full two hours before Morehouse couldget close enough to read the name of the vessel. It was the Mary Celeste.Morehouse knew this American ship and its master, Captain Benjamin SpoonerBriggs. Less than a month ago both vessels had been loading cargo onneighbouring piers on New York’s East River. The Mary Celeste had set sail forGenoa with a cargo of crude alcohol on 5 November, ten days before the DeiGratia had sailed for Gibraltar; yet now, a month later, she was drifting inmid-Atlantic with no sign of life.Morehouse sent three men to investigate, led by his first mate Oliver Deveau, aman of great physical strength and courage. As they clambered aboard they sawthat the ship’s decks were deserted; a search below revealed that there was nota living soul on board. But the lifeboat was missing, indicating that CaptainBriggs had decided to abandon ship.There was a great deal of water below decks; two sails had been blown away, andthe lower foretop sails were hanging by their corners. Yet the ship seemedseaworthy, and was certainly in no danger of sinking. Then why had the crewabandoned her? Further research revealed that the binnacle, the box containingthe ship’s compass, had been smashed, and the compass itself was broken. Twocargo hatches had been ripped off, and one of the casks of crude alcohol hadbeen stoved in. Both forward and aft storage lockers contained a plentifulsupply of food and water.The seamen’s chests were still in the crew’s quarters, an indication of thehaste in which the ship had been deserted. But a search of the captain’s cabinrevealed that the navigation instruments and navigation log were missing. Thelast entry in the general log was dated 25 November; it meant that the MaryCeleste had sailed without crew for at least nine days, and that she was nowsome 700 miles north-east of her last recorded position.Apart from Captain Briggs and a crew of seven, the Mary Celeste had also sailedwith Brigg’s wife Sarah and his two-year old daughter Sophia Matilda. Faced withthe mystery of why they had abandoned ship for no obvious reason, Morehouseexperienced a certain superstitious alarm when Deveau suggested that two of theDei Gratia’s crew should sail the Mary Celeste to Gibraltar; it was the prospectof £5,000 salvage money that finally made him agree to Deveau’s scheme.Both ships arrived in Gibraltar harbour six days later. And instead of thewelcome he expected, Deveau was greeted by an English bureaucrat who nailed anorder of immediate arrest to the Mary Celeste’s mainmast. The date significantlywas Friday the 13th.From the beginning the Mary Celeste had been an unlucky ship. She was registeredoriginally as the Amazon, and her first captain had died within forty-eighthours. On her maiden voyage she had hit a fishing weir off the coast of Maine,and damaged her hull. While this was being repaired a fire had broken outamidships. Later, while sailing through the Straits of Dover, she hit anotherbrig, which sank. This had occurred under her third captain; her fourthaccidentally ran the ship aground on Cape Brenton Island and wrecked her.The Amazon was salvaged, and passed through the hands of three more ownersbefore she was bought by J.H. Winchester, the founder of a successful shippingline which still operates in New York. Winchester discovered that the brig –which had now been renamed Mary Celeste – had dry rot in her timbers, and he hadthe bottom rebuilt with copper lining and the deck cabin lengthened. Theserepairs had ensured that the ship was in excellent condition before she hadsailed for Genoa under the experienced Captain Briggs – this helped to explainwhy she had survived so long in the wintry Atlantic after the crew had taken tothe lifeboat.British officials at Gibraltar seemed to suspect either mutiny or some Yankeeplot – the latter theory based on the fact that Captain Morehouse and CaptainBriggs had been friends, and had apparently dined together the day before theMary Celeste had sailed from New York. But at the inquiry that followed, theidea of mutiny seemed to have gained favour. To back this theory the Court ofInquiry was shown an axe-mark on one of the ship’s rails, scoring on her hullthat was described as a crude attempt to make the ship look as if she had hitrocks, and a stained sword that was found beneath the captain’s bunk. All this,it was claimed, pointed to the crew getting drunk, killing the master and hisfamily, and escaping in the ship’s boat.The Americans were insulted by what they felt was a slur on the honour of the USMerchant Navy, and indignantly denied this story. They pointed out that Briggswas not only known to be a fair man who was not likely to provoke his crew tomutiny, but also that he ran a dry ship; the only alcohol on the Mary Celestewas the cargo. And even a thirsty sailor would not be likely to drink more thana mouthful of crude alcohol – it would cause severe stomach pains and eventualblindness. Besides, if the crew had mutinied, why should they leave behind theirsea-chests together with such items as family photographs, razors and sea-boots?The British Admiralty remained unconvinced, but had to admit that if thealternative theory was correct, and Briggs and Morehouse had decided to make afalse claim for salvage, Briggs would actually have lost by the deal – he waspart-owner of the ship, and his share of any salvage would have come to afraction of what he could have made by selling his share in the normal way.In March 1873 the court was finally forced to admit that it was unable to decidewhy the Mary Celeste had been abandoned, the first time in its history that ithad failed to come to a definite conclusion. The Dei Gratia’s owners wereawarded one-fifth of the value of the Mary Celeste and her cargo. The brigherself was returned to her owner, who lost no time in selling her the momentshe got back to New York.During the next eleven years the Mary Celeste had many owners, but broughtlittle profit to any of them. Sailors were convinced she was unlucky. Her lastowner, Captain Gilman C. Parker, ran her aground on a reef in the West Indiesand made a claim for insurance. The insurers became suspicious, and Parker andhis associates were brought to trial. At that time the penalty for deliberatelyscuttling a ship on the high seas was death by hanging; but the judge, mindfulof the Mary Celeste’s previous record of bad luck, allowed the men to bereleased on a technicality. Within eight months Captain Parker was dead, one ofthe associates had gone mad, and another had committed suicide. The Mary Celesteherself had been left to break up on the reef.Over the next decade or so, as no new evidence came to light, interest in thestory waned. During the trial, when fraud was still suspected, a careful watchhad been kept on the major ports of England and America. But there was no signof any of the missing crew.In the year 1882 a 23-year-old newly qualified doctor named Arthur Doyle movedto Southsea, a suburb of Portsmouth, and screwed up his nameplate. And duringthe long weeks of waiting for patients he whiled away the time writing shortstories. It was in the autumn of 1882 that he began a story: “In the month ofDecember 1873, the British ship Dei Gratia steered into Gibraltar, having in towa derelict brigantine Marie Celeste, which had been picked up in the latitude38°40´, longitude 70°15´ west”.For such a short sentence, this contains a remarkable number of inaccuracies.The year was actually 1872; the Dei Gratia did not tow the Marie Celeste, thelatter came under its own sail; the latitude and longitude are wrong; and theship was called plain English Mary, not Marie. All the same, when “J. HabakukJephson’s Statement” was published in the Cornhill magazine in 1884 it caused asensation, launching Arthur Doyle’s career as a writer – he was soon using thename A. Conan Doyle. Most people took it for the truth, and from then on it waswidely accepted that the Mary Celeste had been taken over by a kind of BlackPower leader with a hatred of Whites. Mr Solly Flood, the chief investigator inthe Mary Celeste case, was so indignant that he sent a telegram to the CentralNews Agency denouncing J. Habakuk Jephson as a fraud and a liar. From then onthe Cornhill was willing to publish most of Conan Doyle’s stories at thirtyguineas a time instead of the three guineas he had been paid so far.Doyle’s story was the signal for a new interest in the mystery, and over thenext few years there were a number of hoax accounts of the last days of the MaryCeleste. They told all kinds of stories from straightforward mutinies to massaccidents – such as everyone falling into the sea when a platform made to watcha swimming race gave way, or the finding of another derelict carrying goldbullion, which tempted Captain Briggs to leave his own ship drifting while heescaped in the other one. One author argued that all the crew had been draggedthrough the ship’s portholes at night by a ravenous giant squid, while CharlesFort, the eminent paranormal researcher, suggested the crew had been snatchedaway by the same strange force that causes rains of frogs and live fish. Fortadded, “I have a collection of yarns, by highly individualized liars, or artistswho scorned, in any particular, to imitate one another; who told, thirty, forty,or fifty years later, of having been members of this crew”. Even today the MaryCeleste often sails unsuspectingly into TV serials and Sci-Fi movies to becomeinvolved in time warps or attacked by aliens in UFOs.In fact, a careful study of the facts reveals that the solution of thisparticular mystery is obvious.The man most responsible for the perpetuation of the myth about the Mary Celestewas Conan Doyle: it was he who insisted that the ship’s boats were still intact.This small inaccuracy made an otherwise simple problem virtually insoluble.In fact, once we know that the boat was missing, we at least know one thing forcertain: that the crew abandoned ship, apparently in great haste – the wheel wasnot lashed, an indication that the ship was abandoned in a hurry. The questionthen presents itself: what could have caused everyone on board to abandon theship in such a hurry?Captain James Briggs, the brother of the Mary Celeste’s skipper, was convincedthat the clue lay in the last entry in the log, for the morning of 25 November1872: it stated that the wind had dropped after a night of heavy squalls. JamesBriggs believed the ship may have become becalmed in the Azores, and started todrift towards the dangerous rocks of Santa Maria Island. The gash-marks foundalong the side of the Mary Celeste – which the British investigators had claimedwere deliberately made by the ship’s mutinous crew – may have been made when sheactually rubbed against a submerged rock, convincing the crew that she was aboutto sink.Oliver Deveau proposed that during the storms some water had found its way frombetween decks into the hold, giving the impression that the ship was leaking.Another popular explanation is that a waterspout hit the Mary Celeste. Theatmospheric pressure inside a waterspout is low; this could have caused thehatch-covers to blow open and forced bilge water into the pump well; this wouldhave made it look as if the ship had taken on six to eight feet of water and wassinking fast.There are basic objections to all these three answers. If the ship scrapeddangerous rocks off Santa Maria Island, then the lifeboat would have been closeenough to land on the Island. Since no survivors were found and no wreckage fromthe lifeboat, this seems unlikely.Oliver Deveau’s theory has a great deal more in its favour. There have oftenbeen panics at sea. When Captain Cook’s Endeavour was in difficulties off thecoast of eastern Australia the ship’s carpenter was sent to take a reading ofthe water in the hold. He made a mistake, and the resulting hysteria might haveended with the crew leaving the ship if Cook had not been able to control thepanic. On another occasion a ship which was carrying a hold full of timberdumped the whole lot into the sea off Newfoundland, before anyone realized thatit would be next to impossible to sink a ship full of wood. But it seemsunlikely that a captain of Briggs’s known efficiency would allow some simplemisreading to cause a panic.The objection to the waterspout theory is that, apart from the open hatches, theship was completely undamaged. If a waterspout was big enough to cause such apanic, it would surely have caused far more havoc.In any case, the real mystery is why, if the crew left the Mary Celeste in thelifeboat, they made no attempt to get back on board when they saw that the shipwas in no danger of sinking.Only one explanation covers all the facts. Briggs had never shipped crudealcohol before, and being a typical New England puritan, undoubtedly mistrustedit. The change in temperature between New York and the Azores would have causedcasks of alcohol to sweat and leak. The night of storms, in which the barrelswould have been shaken violently, would have caused vapour to form inside thecasks, slowly building up pressure until the lids of two or three blew off. Theexplosion, though basically harmless, might have blown the hatches off the cargohold on to the deck in the positions in which Deveau later found them. Convincedthat the whole ship was about to explode, Briggs ordered everyone into thelifeboat. In his haste, he failed to take the one simple precaution that wouldhave saved their lives – to secure the lifeboat to the Mary Celeste by a fewhundred yards of cable. The sea was fairly calm when the boat was lowered, as weknow from the last entry in the log, but the evidence of the torn sailsindicates that the ship then encountered severe gales. We may conjecture thatthe rising wind blew the Mary Celeste into the distance, while the crew in thelifeboat rowed frantically in a futile effort to catch up. The remainder of thestory is tragically obvious."},{"pageContent":"34 Glenn MillerThe Strange Disappearance of a BandleaderOn 24 December 1944, an official press release stated that “Major Alton GlennMiller, Director of the famous United States Army Air Force Band, which has beenplaying in Paris, is reported missing while on a flight from London to Paris.The plane in which he was a passenger left England on 15 December and no traceof it has been found since its takeoff”.Glenn Miller’s rise to fame and wealth had not been an easy one. Born inClarinda, Iowa, in March 1904, he learned to play the trombone at thirteen andhelped to pay his way at the University of Colorado by playing with local dancebands. He joined Ben Pollack’s band at the age of twenty and over the next tenyears became known in New York as an arranger as well as a trombonist, playingwith Red Nichols, Smith Ballew, and the Dorsey brothers. A dance orchestra heorganized for Ray Noble in 1934 became popular through its broadcasts, butMiller’s own orchestra, organized in 1937, was a failure. A second orchestra,organized in the following year, did little better.The breakthrough came in March 1939, when the band played at the Glen IslandCasino in a suburb of New York and the audience was overwhelmed with enthusiasmat this new, distinctive, Glenn Miller sound, with its smooth, almost syrupy,brass. Radio broadcasts spread the fever across the country, and Miller was soona rich man. Although he lacked the sheer inventive genius of other jazzmen ofthe period – Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie, for example – the“seamless and rich” perfection of numbers like “Moonlight Serenade” made him thefavourite of the American middle classes, while “hot” numbers like “In the Mood”and “Tuxedo Junction” made him popular with a younger generation that waslearning to jive. He went to Hollywood and made two classic films, OrchestraWives (1941) and Sun Valley Serenade (1942). During this period he became afriend of actor David Niven – a friendship that, as we shall see, plays an oddpart in the mystery of Glenn Miller’s disappearance.In 1942, as a patriotic gesture, Miller joined the air force. He soon assembledanother band and was assigned to entertaining the troops abroad. He was sent toLondon. David Niven had also joined up – but in the British Army. Since he was afamous show-business personality, he was also given an important post inarmed-forces entertainment, and one of his jobs was to organize Glenn Miller’stours. He was, in effect, Miller’s boss. The man actually in charge oforganizing the details of Miller’s tours – hotel and travel arrangements – wasLieutenant Don Haynes, Miller’s former booking agent, now also in the U.S. AirForce.In November 1944 Niven organized a six-week tour for Miller’s band, starting onSaturday, 16 December. The band was due to fly to Paris on that day. But on 12December, as Don Haynes and Miller were walking back to their London hotel,Miller told Haynes – according to Haynes’s later story – that he wanted to go aday early because he had a social engagement. Haynes said he would book Milleron a flight from RAF Bovingdon, northwest of London, the usual takeoff point forContinental flights.The following day, Wednesday, 13 December, Haynes claims he left Miller inLondon and drove back to Bedford, where the band was housed in billets, toarrange their flight. The following morning, he claims, he ran intoLieutenant-Colonel Norman Baessell, who was special assistant to the stationcommander at RAF Milton Ernest, near Bedford. Baessell mentioned that he wouldbe flying to Paris the next day – Thursday – and offered Haynes a lift. Haynesdeclined, saying he would be flying with the band on Saturday, but mentionedthat Glenn Miller would like a lift. Haynes telephoned Miller, who accepted theoffer; Haynes went to London to collect him and took him back to RAF MiltonErnest.The next morning Haynes collected Miller and Baessell and took them to thenearby airfield, Twinwood Farm. At about 1:40, their plane arrived – a smallAmerican prop-driven plane called a Norseman, piloted by Flight Officer John R.S. Morgan. In spite of appalling weather conditions, they took off five minuteslater – and vanished.We now know what happened to the plane. It flew across the channel toward Dieppebut began to experience engine trouble; the pilot was forced to ditch in the seaonly six miles west of Le Touquet, which is some distance north of Dieppe. Theplane was located in 1973 and examined by an independent diver seven yearslater. Its propeller was missing. This suggested a leak in the hydraulic system,which failed to adjust the blades to the required speed; the propeller“oversped” and probably fell off.Now as strange as it sounds, no one at the time seems to have realized what hadhappened. On Monday (the flight was delayed by bad weather) the band arrived atOrly Airport, near Paris, and Haynes was puzzled when Miller failed to turn upto meet them. Haynes spent the rest of Monday, and the whole of the followingday, searching Paris – which had recently been liberated – for the bandleader.He finally contacted General Ray Barker, who was in charge of all U.S. militarypersonnel in Paris. Two days later, when the band played its first Parisengagement, the audience was simply told that “Major Miller could not be withthe band”. Miller’s death was announced three days later.That was the story. But Miller’s wife, Helen – the childhood sweetheart whom hehad married – didn’t want to believe it. To begin with, she hoped that he hadbeen taken prisoner. And when, after the end of the war, it became clear thatthis was a forlorn hope, she began instituting inquiries that involved searchingwar cemeteries, hoping that at least she could find a grave that she couldvisit. In February 1946 a certain Colonel Donnell wrote in answer to her inquiryto tell her that her husband had not been flying in one of the passenger planesbut in a combat aircraft not designed for passengers. This aircraft, he said,was cleared to fly from Abbotts Ripton Field, near Huntington, to Bordeaux. NowBordeaux is long way short of Paris, and Helen Miller must have found herselfwondering whether her husband was supposed to walk the extra distance. Ofcourse, the Norseman could have been intended to land at Paris and then go on toBordeaux; but if so, the clearance would have said as much. The letter concludedby telling her firmly that no further information was available.The rumor that there had been some sort of cover-up in the case led variousresearchers to try to track down the official documents. One of these, an ex-RAFofficer named John Edwards, dismissed the cover-up theory and set out to provethat Glenn Miller had been on board the Norseman when it crashed. It was simply,he thought, a matter of getting the official form – called a 201 – aboutMiller’s death from the Washington file where it must be kept. But he found itto be a less simple task than he expected. The Records Office in Washingtondenied all knowledge of the file. The National Personnel Records Center in StLouis said they thought the records had been lost in a fire. It began to dawn onEdwards that somebody had a reason for sitting on the evidence.Another RAF man, Squadron Leader Jack Taylor, decided to have a try. Hesucceeded in obtaining the MACR (Missing Air Crew Report) but found that thesignature was illegible and the typed details so blurred as to be almostunreadable. Two other documents he succeeded in obtaining showed only that nokind of search for Glenn Miller had been instituted at the time. This in itselfseemed odd, for the Allies were by then in control of most of France, and therewould have been nothing to prevent a thorough search for the famous bandleader.It was Taylor who approached another ex-RAF pilot named Wilbur Wright, who hadbecome a highly successful novelist and therefore had time to spare. It was truethat, by 1986, most of the witnesses were dead; but Wright reasoned that itought to be straightforward enough to obtain whatever records existed. If therewas any difficulty, he could invoke the Freedom of Information Act. And soWilbur Wright took a deep breath and wrote to the United States Air ForceInspection and Safety Center in Norton, California, for the accident report onthe missing plane. The reply stated that they had no record of an accidentinvolving a Norseman on that date. A second letter drew from them the reply thatno Norseman airplanes had been reported missing in December 1944. But Wright hada way of checking this – a document called the Cumulative Loss Listing. And thistold him that there had been no fewer than eight Norseman airplanes lost inDecember 1944.Wright began to smell a rat. And when letters to the Washington Records Office,the Army Casualty Division, and the Air Force History department met withsimilar blanks, one thing at least became obvious. This was not vagueness orincompetence; he was being deliberately stonewalled. Another letter to theCasualty Division in Alexandria, Virginia, brought a fascinating revelation.They admitted plaintively that they had been trying for years to obtain theGlenn Miller file from Washington and had been totally ignored.Over the next month or so Wright kept up a furious barrage of letters to variousagencies. He even wrote directly to President Reagan, asking him to intervene.He secured one grudging admission from Military Reference, admitting that therewere several documents in the Miller file and listing them. But the WashingtonRecords Office continued to insist that all documents had been lost or mislaid.In January 1987 Wright telephoned the records office and demanded to talk to the“top man”. He was put through to a Mr George Chalou, and he explained that hewas a professional author and wanted to see the Glenn Miller burial file. Headded that he had written repeatedly and got nowhere and that the CasualtyDivision people in Alexandria complained that Washington would not give them thefile. “Right”!, said Mr Chalou, “and there’s no way they’ll get them backeither. Those files have been under lock and key for years, and that’s howthey’ll stay”. Wilbur Wright, who was recording the conversation, stared at thephone in dumbstruck astonishment. At last he had an admission that the file wasbeing kept under wraps.He went on to mention that he had written to Ronald Reagan – but did not mentionthat so far he had received no reply. That drew a gasp of “You didn’t!” followedby a demand for Wright’s telephone number. But there was no return telephonecall – only more letters assuring Wright that he had now received all theinformation that was available. But further pressure elicited the reply that themissing file had now been found and that when Wright came to visit the office,he would see the “original MACR”. That confirmed what Wright had alreadydeduced: that the MACR obtained by Squadron Leader Jack Taylor was a fake.The Washington Records Office then decided to send the file to the CasualtyDivision in Virginia, assuring them that it had only just been located. Virginiawrote to Wright telling him that they had now mailed him a copy of the missingfile. And eventually, weeks later, the file finally arrived.This – as might be expected – included no astounding revelations; if it had,presumably it would not have been sent. But it confirmed one thing: the MissingAir Crew Report obtained by Taylor was not the original; close study revealedthat it had been altered. Moreover, only page 1 had been included; page 2, whichshould have contained the signature, was missing. And when, with his usualincredible persistence, Wright obtained the missing page – which turned up inthe pilot’s Burial File – it had no signature. The later “signed” version was afabrication. So why had the original unsigned version not been given to Taylor –or released soon after the accident? Obviously, because it had not been signed,and this would have caused suspicion. Because Captain Ralph S. Cramer, whoshould have signed it, must have known that he would have been putting hissignature to something that was untrue, he preferred not to.All this, Wright realized, sounded inconclusive; perhaps Cramer was in a hurryand forgot to sign it; perhaps the Washington Records Office genuinely mislaidthe file. But there was one other piece of evidence that Wilbur Wright felt wasfar more striking: the actor David Niven had been a friend of Miller’s sincethey had met in Hollywood in the early 1940s. As mentioned earlier, he wasMiller’s “boss” when Miller came to London as a member of the U.S. Air Force,and he arranged that final tour, which was never made. Yet in his bestsellingautobiography, The Moon’s a Balloon, Niven did not even mention Glenn Miller.And he also failed to say anything about him to his biographer, Sheridan Morley.There is an equally odd omission in Niven’s autobiography. He was in Paris atthe time of Miller’s disappearance, arranging a tour for Marlene Dietrich,another old friend – in fact, she, Niven, and Miller met for dinner wheneverthey could. The Battle of the Bulge – in which the Germans tried to relaunch theoffensive against the Allies – began on the day after Miller “disappeared”, andMarlene Dietrich (who was, of course, German, and could have been shot as atraitor if captured) had to be hastily evacuated to Paris. Niven made a franticphone call to a colleague in England, Colonel Hignett, to try to borrow a squadof “rough-necks” (commandos) to go and rescue Miss Dietrich. Hignett had torefuse, since all his men were on red alert. Then why did Niven fail to mentionthis important episode in his autobiography? He mentions the period but says hewas elsewhere, at a place called Spa, two hundred miles from Paris. And abiography of Marlene Dietrich confirms that she and Niven were together on theday before Miller “disappeared” and that she was “rescued” from the Germanadvance and returned to Paris.Wright’s conclusion was that Niven knew exactly what had happened to GlennMiller and that whatever it was, it was not a drowning accident off Le Touquet.But if Miller was not on the Norseman when it crashed, where was he? Presumablyin Paris, where he was supposed to be – and with Niven and Marlene Dietrich.Assuming that that was correct, and that Miller flew to Paris – either onThursday (the 14th) from Bovingdon, or on the following day – then what happenedto him in Paris that led to a coverup?Wright’s lengthy investigation – far too lengthy to describe in detail – led himto study many possible scenarios. He lists these in his book Millergate (1990).Miller’s brother Herb was convinced that Glenn never left England but that hedied of cancer. This obviously raises the question of why a cover-up would havebeen necessary. There is nothing disgraceful about dying of cancer.Another theory studied by Wright was that Miller’s plane was shot down by Germanfighters. But the weather over the Continent on 15 December was so bad that allplanes were grounded. Moreover, the Luftwaffe records make no mention of a planebeing shot down over the Channel. Oddly enough, Wright’s investigations revealedthat the weather over Twinwood Airfield was still good and not, as Haynesclaimed, appalling. The inference was that Haynes had invented the appallingweather to make his story more convincing.Another rumor alleged that Miller had been taken prisoner and died in aprisoner-of-war camp. Wright dismisses this theory, pointing out that theGermans would have announced the capture of Glenn Miller to undermine Alliedmorale.A more promising lead was connected with Lieutenant-Colonel Normal Baessell, whoproved to have an extremely dubious reputation as a drug smuggler. Wrightinvestigated a rumor that Baessell had been smuggling drugs to an airstrip innorthern France on that fatal flight, that Glenn Miller had objected, and thatBaessell had shot him and concealed the body; on their way back, the planecrashed. Wright’s research revealed that Baessell was certainly a swashbucklingcharacter, macho and aggressive, who would have been perfectly capable of drugsmuggling. But there is not the slightest piece of confirmatory evidence thatthis is what happened.One of the most interesting stories was told by a man named Dennis Cottam, whohad gone to Paris in 1954 to pick up a car. In a place called Fred’s Bar, notfar from the Hotel Olympiades in Montmartre, where the Miller band had stayed,Cottam was told by the bartender, “You English think Glenn Miller died in theChannel on 15 December 1944, yet he was drinking in here that same evening”. Hetold Cottam that if he wanted confirmation of this story, he should go to ablue-painted door on the other side of the street and ask the lady there aboutGlenn Miller. The door turned out to be that of a brothel, and the Madame theretold Cottam that in 1944 her boyfriend had been a Provost Marshall Captain andthat he had told her that he saw and identified the body of Glenn Miller. Butwhy was he killed? Cottam wanted to know. “Because he knew too much about theBlack Market”.That was certainly interesting. But would Black Marketeers really kill a famousbandleader who had only been in Paris for twenty-four hours or so – scarcelyenough time to learn much about the Black Market?Interviews with researcher John Edwards also brought some interesting insights.He obtained a tape made by a BBC engineer named Teddy Gower, who claimed that hehad flown to Paris (Orly) with Glenn Miller from Bovingdon on Thursday, 14December, the day Miller had actually wanted to fly. Don Haynes had admittedthat Miller wanted to fly to Orly on the 14th, and that he (Haynes) had promisedto arrange a flight from Bovingdon, the usual airfield for Continental flights.Yet, according to Haynes, he had changed his mind and accepted Baessell’s offerto give Miller a lift to Paris on the following day, Friday.But why should Miller prefer a “lift” in a small plane (Miller hated smallplanes) on Friday to a comfortable trip in a larger Dakota on Thursday? Wrighthad already found many inconsistencies in Haynes’s story that led him to believethat he was lying. For example, Haynes claimed that he had driven back toBedford on the Wednesday afternoon in thick fog, when Wright was able to uncoverevidence that he and Glenn Miller had spent that evening at the Milroy Club witha group of officers and a girl singer. This, and much other evidence, convincedWright that Haynes was closely involved in the cover-up. Miller had flown toParis on the Thursday in a Dakota and had probably been met by David Niven, whowas certainly in Paris that day.John Edwards had another rather odd story to tell Wilbur Wright. Because of thepublicity given to his search for Glenn Miller, he had received many letters.One of these was from a World War II veteran who claimed that he had not onlyknown Major Glenn Miller but had been with Miller in a military hospital inColumbus, Ohio, when the bandleader died of head injuries. That sounded soabsurd that Edwards had not even followed up the story but had thrown the letterinto the wastebasket.Edwards also told Wright about an American doctor named David Pecora who claimedto have been present at the time Glenn Miller died. With his usual incrediblepersistence, Wright finally succeeded in tracing Pecora. The result wasdisappointing – Pecora agreed that he had been in France at the time but said hehad no knowledge of Glenn Miller.Nevertheless, this false lead was to prove productive. Tracking down Pecora hadinvolved much letter writing to New Jersey, the state where Miller had livedbefore he joined the U.S. Air Force, Wright decided to write to the StateRegistrar in New Jersey, asking if they had any record of the death of a MajorAlton Glenn Miller; he gave all the necessary family details, including placeand date of birth. But by accident he gave Miller’s state of birth as Ohioinstead of Iowa. He was astonished to receive a letter confirming that AltonGlenn Miller had died in Ohio in December 1944. A telephone call to theregistrar in New Jersey confirmed that Alton Glenn Miller, later a resident ofNew Jersey, had died in Ohio. At this point, Wilbur Wright made a mistake.Instead of asking for further details of where Miller died, he told the woman onthe other end of the telephone, “You realize we are talking about the GlennMiller who vanished in Europe in 1944”? After a long silence, the woman said,“We’ll call you back”. In fact, she called back two days later to say that thetypist had made an error. They had sent him Glenn Miller’s place of birthinstead of his place of death.Wright was baffled. How could they confuse a place of birth in 1904 with a placeof death in 1944? What’s more, Wright said to the woman, Miller was born inIowa, not Ohio. “It was a typing error”, the woman insisted. “And anyway, Ohio,Iowa – it’s the same state”. Samuel Goldwyn is known to have confused the two,but it sounded strange coming from an employee of a State Registrar.There was, Wright discovered, another oddity that needed explaining. In 1949Helen Miller, who had moved to Pasadena, California, had purchased a six-graveburial plot in nearby Altadena. But the family consisted of only herself and theson and daughter she and Glenn had adopted; there were also her parents, whowere, in due course, buried in the plot. Who was the extra grave for? Thecemetery authorities were asked to deny that Glenn Miller was buried in theplot; it took them fifteen months to do so. They also sent Wilbur Wright’s“confidential” inquiry to Glenn Miller’s adopted son, Steve, whose response wasto write an angry letter to Glenn’s brother, Herb – who had replied to Wright’sinquiries – saying: “Get this guy off our backs”.Then what did happen to Glenn Miller? By far the most persistent rumor Wrightencountered was that Miller had received a fatal blow on the head in a brawl ina brothel in Pigalle, Paris. (Pigalle is known as the prostitute’s area.) In a1976 newspaper article, John Edwards speculated that Miller was murdered inParis on the Monday that the band finally arrived. The article summarized, “MrEdwards believes that Miller, who was a bit of a lad with the ladies, died of afractured skull”.Wright was originally skeptical about this story, because he was able todisprove some of the other details given by Edwards – for example, his assertionthat a Lieutenant-Colonel Corrigan was able to confirm the “murder”. Wrighttraced Corrigan, who denied it. Edwards also claimed that an American doctor inParis had signed the death certificate; this was presumably Dr Pecora, whodenied all knowledge of Miller’s death. Yet the sheer persistence of the story –which surfaced in Paris as early as 1948 – suggested that it could be true. Andit certainly fits in with the rest of the information that Wilbur Wrightaccumulated.This, then, is the outline of Wright’s scenario of what happened to GlennMiller:Miller decided to go to Paris two days before the band in order to do some“socializing” – which included buying female companionship. He had arranged tomeet his old friend David Niven, who would be there on 14 December to arrangeMarlene Dietrich’s tour. Niven’s autobiography makes it clear that he was notaverse to female companionship either, having been a flatmate of Errol Flynn.Niven probably met Miller off the Dakota that brought him from Bovingdon onThursday, 15 December. Two days later Niven had to rush off to rescue MarleneDietrich from becoming a victim of the Battle of the Bulge, but the two of themreturned to Paris two days later and may well have joined Miller for a meal.Miller went to a brothel in Pigalle, became involved in some kind of brawl, andwas struck on the head. When Don Haynes arrived at Orly, he was puzzled thatMiller wasn’t there to meet him. He claims that he spent two days searching forMiller in Paris, but (as Wright points out) that would not have been necessary.He must have known where Miller was staying and checked there – probablydiscovering that Miller had been missing all night.The badly injured Miller was located; it seemed clear that he might die. Howcould his death by violence be explained without a scandal? The cover-up began.Miller was flown to a military hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Meanwhile, thedisappearance of the Norseman provided the perfect opportunity for explaininghis nonappearance at the Paris concerts. When the disappearance of the Norsemanwas announced nine days after it had happened, Glenn Miller was already dead inOhio. He was probably buried there. His wife, Helen, was informed that he haddied in the Norseman, but she did not believe it. And eventually, the militaryauthorities decided to tell her what had happened – presumably before shepurchased the six-grave plot in Altadena.Some time thereafter, Glenn Miller was transferred from his unmarked grave inOhio to his resting place in Altadena. Helen joined him there in 1966. Hisfriend Niven, one of the few who knew the secret, maintained an entirelyuncharacteristic silence about Miller for the rest of his life, not evenmentioning him to his second wife. Don Haynes later published his diaries, whichappeared to confirm his story that Miller had flown to Paris from Twinwood onthe morning of Friday, 15 December, in exceptionally bad weather. Wright’sinvestigations revealed that the weather was reasonable on that date but thatthe airfield was closed.Glenn Miller’s records are as popular as ever, and their smooth, seamless soundis still one of the delights of the swing era. Perhaps, after all, Niven andHaynes were right when they decided that, as far as posterity was concerned,Miller had died in a mysterious airplane accident rather than in an undignifiedbrawl in a Paris brothel."},{"pageContent":"35 The Missing LinkThe Unsolved Mystery of Human EvolutionOne day in 1908, an amateur archaeologist named Charles Dawson, who made hisliving as a solicitor, was walking along a farm road near Piltdown Common inEast Sussex, England, when he noted some peculiar brown flints that had beenused to mend the road. When he learned that they had been found in a gravel bedon the farm, he went along to take a look at it. Two workmen were digging, andDawson asked them if they had found any fossils; they said no. But when Dawsonreturned later, one of them handed him a piece of a human skull. Three yearslater, in the same place, Dawson found another piece.In the following year, 1912, Dawson decided to show the pieces to his friend, DrArthur Smith Woodward, the keeper of the Department of Geology at the BritishMuseum, and during that summer, Smith Woodward came to look at the site,bringing another geologist, the French priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (whowas to become famous four years after his death, in 1955, for his book ThePhenomenon of Man). They quickly discovered what Dawson described as a “humanmandible” (lower jaw) with two molar teeth. Prehistoric animal bones andprimitive human tools in the same gravel pit seemed to date the jaw as beingabout half a million years old. Part of a human skull also turned up in the pit.This was a matter of great excitement, for man himself is only about half amillion years old. At any rate, the sudden expansion of the brain that hasbecome known as “the brain explosion” began – for reasons no one understands –half a million years ago. (The “first man”, Homo erectus, dates back about oneand a quarter million years but had a brain the size of an ape’s.) What was sostartling about this find was that the jaw was definitely apelike, yet it fitthe cranium. They had apparently discovered something that science had beenseeking for almost half a century – what Charles Darwin had called “the MissingLink”, the definitive proof that man is descended from the ape.It’s hard for us to understand the scandal that had been caused by thepublication of Darwin’s Origin of Species in November 1859. Most of us take thenotion of evolution for granted and regard biblical fundamentalism as an absurdjoke. In 1859 Darwin’s conclusions seemed to shake the foundations ofChristianity, and therefore the foundations of British society. The firstedition of the book actually sold out on its first day. And in spite of thecaution with which he had phrased his conclusions – that all species emergethrough natural selection due to the survival of the fittest – Darwin was soonbeing accused of atheism and downright wickedness. In 1859 most British peopleaccepted that the account of creation in Genesis was entirely factual, and mostaccepted Archbishop Usher’s estimate of the date of creation (worked out fromthe Bible) as 4004 BC.Admittedly, Sir Charles Lyell had disproved this almost thirty years before inhis Principles of Geology, in which he showed that the earth must be millions ofyears old. But somehow, this did not bother the Church too much – after all, ifGod created the rocks, he may well have created them with million-year-oldfossils, in much the same way that you might stock a new library with old books.But Darwin was saying that man was not the “Lord of Creation”, merely alatecomer descended from the ape. In a speech in Parliament, Disraeli made thefamous comment that in the controversy about whether man was an ape or an angel,he was on the side of the angels.The historic battle – evolutionism’s equivalent of the Battle of Hastings – tookplace in Oxford on 30 June 1860, and the two leading debaters were Bishop SamuelWilberforce – known as “Soapy Sam” because of his unctuous manner – and“Darwin’s bulldog”, biologist Thomas Henry Huxley. After Soapy Sam had given ahumorous and satirical account of the theory of evolution, he turned politely toHuxley and “begged to know, was it through his grandfather or his grandmotherthat he claimed his descent from a monkey”? He sat down to roars of laughter andapplause.It is reported that Huxley slapped his knee and whispered to his neighbour, “TheLord hath delivered him into my hands”. Huxley rose to his feet and spokequietly and gravely, explaining Darwin’s theory in plain and simple language. Heconcluded by saying, “I would not be ashamed to have a monkey for my ancestor,but I would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used his great gifts toobscure the truth”. The applause that followed was as thunderous as the applausethat had followed Wilberforce’s attack. One woman fainted. And Wilberforce wasso stunned that he declined the opportunity to have a final say.Eleven years later, in 1871, Darwin declared his belief that archaeology wouldturn up the proof of his theory in “the Missing Link”. Darwinians were eager tohave the honour of fulfilling that prophecy. And in 1912 it looked as if CharlesDawson had succeeded triumphantly.Other finds followed. Teilhard de Chardin found a human canine in the debristhat had been thrown out of the pit; it fit the skull. An elephant bone shapedinto a club – the earliest known weapon – was also found. And when, in 1915,another “Piltdown cranium” was found two miles away, even the doubters wereconvinced. This “proved” beyond all doubt that man was the descendant of an ape.Dawson had only a year longer to live; he died in 1916, at the age of fifty-two,in a glow of celebrity. Woodward had christened his discovery Eoanthropusdawsoni – Dawsonian dawn man. And in due course a statue of Dawson was erectednear the gravel pit.The problem was that Dawson’s dawn man did not seem to fit into the emergingpicture of human evolution. For example, Neanderthal man, which had beendiscovered in 1857, had a receding jaw; so did the much older Heidelberg man,discovered in 1907 (and also dated at about half a million years old). So didJava man, discovered in 1891. But these all looked much more humanoid, lessapelike, than dawn man. In short, Piltdown dawn man was far too late to be theMissing Link.The bubble finally burst in 1953, when the Piltdown skull was subjected to thelatest scientific tests at the British Museum by Dr Kenneth Oakley. Theseincluded fluorine analysis. (Fluorine accumulates in buried bones, so the oldera bone, the more fluorine it contains.) The Piltdown skull proved to be a mere50,000 years old, while the jawbone proved to be that of a chimpanzee; both hadbeen stained with iron sulphate and pigment. The Piltdown skull, which hadfigured in so many books on the evolution of man, was a hoax. But who wasresponsible for it?The obvious suspect was Dawson himself. Evidence began to accumulate that he wasnot as honest as everyone had supposed. Dr J. S. Weiner, the author of a bookentitled The Piltdown Problem (1955), went down to Sussex, and in a cabinet offossils belonging to a contemporary of Dawson’s, Harry Morris, found a flintdescribed on its accompanying card as “stained by C. Dawson with intent todefraud”. In fact, Dawson is known to have stained the bones with bichromate topreserve them – or at least that is the reason he gave Woodward. Localhistorians had criticized Dawson for basing his History of Hastings Castle,without acknowledgment, on an earlier history. And there was a story that he hadbought a house that was being considered for the site of the headquarters of theSussex Archaeological Society by using his membership to snatch it from underthe society members’ noses. Whoever “salted” the gravel pit with primitivetools, and bones of hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and deer, had access to this kindof material. And the same person placed the second “Piltdown skull” two milesaway to silence the skeptics. Dawson was certainly in a position to do thesethings.On the other hand, Francis Vere, author of The Piltdown Fantasy, is convincedthat Dawson did not have sufficient knowledge to carry out the fraud – forexample, enough knowledge of dentistry to grind down the teeth. He believes thatthe hoaxer was one of the many local amateur geologists – like Harry Morris (whois known to have been an embittered man).But why was it done? If Dawson did it, then the reason may have been either thedesire for personal aggrandizement or the desire to prove Darwin right once andfor all. Fifty years after the publication of The Origin of Species, the worldwas still full of fundamentalists who could not accept Darwinism. In 1925 aschoolteacher named John Scopes was put on trial in Dayton, Tennessee, forteaching his pupils the theory of evolution. Scopes was found guilty and fined$100.In a pamphlet entitled Lessons of Piltdown (published by the Evolution ProtestMovement in 1959), Francis Vere even suggests that Teilhard de Chardin couldhave been responsible for the Piltdown hoax. Vere’s protest is also directed atthe notion that man is descended from the ape, and he suggests that what thescientists ought to be trying to explain is the “gift to Man from God – themind”. Vere’s protest is in the spirit of the complaint of Samuel Butler –another anti-Darwinian – who claimed that the theory of natural selection had“banished God from the universe”. Bernard Shaw took up his protest in thepreface to Back to Methuselah, in which he argued that the failure of Darwinismlies in its rigid determinism, its failure to recognize the part played inevolution by the will of the individual.What, in fact, has happened since the 1950s is that the objections of historianslike Vere – and even of the townsfolk of Dayton – have been justified by newdiscoveries that prove, once and for all, that there is no connection betweenhuman beings and apes. Some ninety million years ago, in the age that succeededthe dinosaurs (who lived from about 250 to 150 million years ago), the ancestorof both the apes and man was a tiny insect-eating creature that resembled amouse or shrew and that lived in the steaming forests that covered the earth. Atabout this time, these creatures felt confident enough to emerge from theundergrowth and take to the trees, where they ate seeds and tender leaves and anew development called fruit, rather than insects. It was probably as aconsequence of living in trees that the “mouse” developed a “hand” with a thumband four fingers, rather than a paw with all the digits side by side. Many ofthese creatures were exterminated by their cousins the rodents, who had onemajor advantage – their teeth never stopped growing and so never wore down. Butthey survived in Africa – or rather, in the vast continent that included Africaand South America, before they drifted apart forty million years ago. By thistime, the tree shrew had turned into a monkey – so in that sense, man isdescended from a monkey.For some reason, monkeys had their eyes in front of their heads, rather than oneither side, as rodents have. This enabled them to develop depth perception,which in time would mean that they could handle tools. (If you try driving a carwith one eye closed, you will find it far more difficult to judge your distancefrom the hedge.) As the earth became dryer, and the lush African forests becamesavannahs, the primates split into two lines, the apes and the monkeys. Theearliest ape seems to have been a creature we call Aegyptopithecus, which livedabout twenty-eight million years ago. Then came Dryopithecus, a baboonlikecreature, which spread out of Africa and across Europe. About fifteen millionyears ago, one line of Dryopithecus took to the trees and became the ancestor ofthe modern ape – the kind we encounter in the Tarzan stories.Next came the ape we call Ramapithecus, found in 1934 in northern India. Thiswas so humanlike that paleontologist G. E. Lewis classified it as a hominid.Ramapithecus seems to date back between eight and fourteen million years and hasa claim to be the “first man”.In 1924, in the part of Africa now called Botswana, miners who were blastingrock discovered fossil bones near a railway station known as Taungs; furtherinvestigation revealed the skull of a child; it still had milk teeth and thuswas reckoned to be about six years old. The brain case was much smaller thanthat of a human child, yet the teeth were definitely human. Professor RaymondDart concluded that this was one of the earliest “true men” yet discovered andcalled it. Australopithecus africanus, or southern ape man. This creature was ameat eater and is nowadays referred to as a “Dartian”. Another type ofAustralopithecus was discovered some time later, a vegetarian with a more robustbuild; he was labeled Australopithecus robustus.Dart’s fellow scientists were unwilling to accept that his meat-eating ape-manwas an important link in the evolutionary chain, but discoveries made by thepaleontologist Robert Broom in the second half of the 1930s left no doubt thatthe “Dartians” were a truly human species that had originated in Africa. Somedated as far back as three million years ago, others a mere three-quarters of amillion years. The “Dartians” seem to have given way to the creature we callHomo erectus, the immediate predecessor of Homo sapiens, while robustus seems tohave died out.At some of the australopithecine sites, Dart found baboon skulls with a kind ofdouble depression in the back. And the discovery of antelope front-leg bones(humeri) at these sites suggested to Dart that these early ape-men had used thebones as clubs. It led him to publish, in 1949, a highly controversial paperentitled. “The Predatory Transition from Ape to Man”, which argued that humanintelligence had developed through the use of weapons. Wielding a club, Dartmaintained, requires a certain degree of coordination between the hand and theeye. In short, Dart was suggesting that man evolved because he was thedescendant of some primitive killer ape, while his more peaceful brothers stayedin the trees and developed into modern gorillas, orangutans, and so on. Dartianman went on to develop tools – stones with their edges chipped off to makeprimitive axes, which could be used to extract marrow from bones – about twomillion years ago.Dart’s version of human evolution was popularized in 1961 by theplaywright-turned-anthropologist Robert Ardrey, in a book entitled AfricanGenesis. This, briefly, is how Ardrey sees human development: About fifteenmillion years ago, in the Miocene era, Africa was still covered with lushforests. Twelve million years ago the rains stopped, and the Miocene gave way tothe long droughts of the Pliocene era. At some point in the Pliocene era, ourhuman ancestors descended from the trees to take their chance on the savannahs.These became the two types of Australopithecus – the meat-eating “Dartians” andthe vegetarian robustus. During this period, Ardrey believes, the “Dartians”learned to use weapons like bone clubs.Then, about a million years ago, the rains came, and the Pleistocene era began.It was the bad weather, Ardrey thinks, that led man to develop his intelligence.Pebble tools made their appearance. So did hand axes. The gentle robustusvanished as rains gave way to periodic droughts, but “Dartian” man, the“bad-weather animal”, survived. And because his chief evolutionary advantage washis aggression, his killer instinct, he gradually became the most dominantspecies on earth. This, Ardrey suggests, is why his greatest problem in ourmodern world is that he will exterminate his own species.It is a gloomy picture, and it can hardly hold any comfort for antievolutionistswho are pleased that we are not descended from the ape. But it is notnecessarily the last word. Richard Leakey, son of the eminent anthropologistLouis Leakey (whom Ardrey quotes extensively), has argued that all the evidenceshows that our primitive ancestors were peaceable creatures and that it was notuntil he began to create cities – with their overcrowding and other problems –that man became cruel and destructive. And the Finnish paleontologist BjörnKurtén developed his own views in a book entitled – significantly – Not from theApes (1972). This, in summary, is his view:Our tree-living Ramapithecine ancestors of about fifteen million years ago (inthe Miocene era) were furry creatures about the size of a modern-dayfive-year-old child; but they had forward-looking eyes and human teeth. Kurténsuggests that these highly social creatures developed a “call system” – ofwarnings and so on – that developed into language. They became capable of“simple thought processes”.With the coming of the droughts – and the savannahs – of the Pliocene era, thesecreatures came down from the trees – not because they were driven down butbecause the savannahs offered a richer way of life. The baboons descended fromthe trees at about the same time. But the baboons remained four-leggedherbivores, while the manlike primates became two-legged carnivores. Theirupright posture allowed them to see farther into the distance – an advantage forhunters. The need for periods of violent activity – chasing small animals forexample – led to the gradual loss of fur.Since the wandering life was hard on women and small children, the band wasinclined to find itself a semipermanent home. The men went hunting while thewomen remained behind. Family life developed, and two-parent families became thenucleus of the population. Sex played an increasingly important part in theirlives, instead of being a “sideshow” (Ardrey’s phrase), as it is for animals inthe wild. Thinner fur made skin contact more sensuous. Because they walkedupright, face-to-face mating gradually replaced sex from the rear. Lips becamefuller and female breasts developed. (Kurtén acknowledges that he owes this ideato Desmond Morris’s Naked Ape.) And at this point, Kurtén agrees that theability to manipulate weapons caused a development of intelligence. Somethingvery like speech evolved from the “monkey chatter”.Homo erectus came into being about two or three million years ago and coexistedwith Dartian man. But while Dartian man had a brain size of about 500 cc, thebrain of Homo erectus slowly developed until it reached 1,000 cc around 400,000years ago. There it stopped, and Homo erectus gradually faded out.But about half a million years ago a new species, Homo sapiens, came on thescene – no one quite knows how. (One scientist, Allan Wilson, has even suggestedthat Homo sapiens developed from Homo erectus in Australia.) What we do know isthat his brain developed from Homo erectus’s 1,000 cc to modern man’s 1,800 ccin such a short period (in evolutionary terms) that scientists speak of “thebrain explosion”.What caused this brain explosion? We now know enough about evolution to knowthat things do not just “happen”. Evolution is not “natural”; the shark hasremained unchanged for 150 million years. Kurtén has nothing much to suggest,except to point out the obvious – that our evolutionary capacities are drawn outof us by changes in the environment (like the bad weather of the Pleistocene).But as far as we know, there have been no such changes in the past half millionyears, except a succession of ice ages. It is possible, of course, that these“pressured” man into developing his brain; but it seems more likely that theywould favour the development of fur or hair. Ardrey even suggests thepossibility that the brain explosion may have been connected with a huge meteorthat exploded over the Indian Ocean about seventy thousand years ago (itsremains, called tektites, can still be found scattered over twenty millionsquare miles) and caused a reversal in the earth’s magnetic field. He suggeststhat if the earth had no magnetic field for a brief intervening period, a rainof cosmic rays may have caused genetic changes in human beings.Another anthropologist, Otto Kiss Maerth, devoted a book entitled The BeginningWas the End (1971) to the theory that human evolution was due to cannibalism –discoveries near Peking in 1929 seemed to show that the ape-men of six hundredthousand years ago ate the brains of their enemies. Maerth suggests that eatingbrains stimulates both the intelligence and the sexual instinct and that thisexplains the brain explosion. The objection to this theory is that there is notenough widespread evidence for cannibalism and the eating of brains to accountfor human evolution.Ardrey has a more plausible basic hypothesis, which he calls “the huntinghypothesis” – the notion that men had to learn social cooperation because theyhad to learn to hunt together. But Ardrey had originally suggested that Dartianman became a carnivore during the Pleistocene era (in the past million years),when droughts made vegetation scarce. When Louis Leakey discovered evidence atFort Ternan, in Kenya, that Ramapithecus was a meat eater nearly fifteen millionyears ago, that view was undermined; yet it only increased Ardrey’s convictionthat the “hunting hypothesis” explains human evolution. What he failed toexplain was why wolves and other animals who hunt in packs have not evolved tothe human level.In fact, this problem has almost certainly been solved by an experimentalpsychologist named Nicholas Humphrey, who studied the brains of mountaingorillas in Rwanda, in central Africa, and wondered why they had such largebrains when their lives are so crudely simple – eating, sleeping, and moving onto new feeding grounds. The answer came as he observed the gorillas closely andnoticed their incredible sensitivity to one another’s feelings. The mostimportant thing in a gorilla’s life is its relation to other gorillas. Agorilla’s family life is the equivalent of a university education; it learns toreact delicately to the moods, feelings, and reactions of other gorillas. IfHumphrey is correct, then the size of the brain has something to do with thecomplexity of social relations.The “Humphrey theory” of evolution, then, would run like this: As man becameincreasingly successful because of his prowess as a hunter, his numbersincreased, and social intercourse with other groups became increasinglyimportant. As sensitivity and cooperation became survival factors, the brainflourished.Yet the “hunting hypothesis” may pave the way to the next step in the argument.If Kurtén is correct in his belief that Dartian man ceased to be a wanderer inthe Pliocene era and began to leave the women and children behind while he wenthunting, then this would apply even more so to Homo sapiens during the greatdroughts and ice ages of the Pleistocene. Most anthropologists seem to recognizethat sex played a basic part in human evolution – from Kurtén and Morris toMaerth, with his brain-eating theory. As Ardrey points out, sex is a sideshow inthe world of nature. Wild animals only become interested in it when the femaleexperiences her periodic cycle. But at some point in his evolution, human sexualdesire became independent of that cycle, and man began to have sex at all timesexcept when the female was menstruating. It seems logical to explain this interms of the hunting hypothesis. If a hunter had been away from home for weeks,then he would expect to make love to his mate when he returned, whether she was“in heat” or not. Some females would naturally object to this; but they wouldhave fewer offspring than the females who had no such objection – or swallowedtheir dislike – and eventually, the objectors would die out.What no one seems to have recognized so far is the importance of sex as an“internal” factor in evolution. When an animal has nothing else to do, it liesdown and yawns. When a man has nothing else to do, his thoughts turn as often asnot to sex. If there is a pretty girl in the vicinity, he may begin to brood onseduction – even if he happens to have a wife already. If he is too shy orotherwise inhibited, then he may simply daydream about sex. From being a“sideshow”, sex has become one of the central interests of human existence.Now if we imagine Stone Age hunters in a period of scarcity, we can see thatthey may have had to have spent longer and longer periods away from the womenand children of the tribe; a hunting expedition might have lasted a month orlonger. Back at home, women were now permanently receptive and were consequentlybeginning to develop the sexual characteristics males found exciting – largerbreasts, full lips, rounded buttocks. When the males came back from a longexpedition, some skinny adolescent girls had suddenly begun to change intodesirable women. The presence of these unattached females must have introducedan element of competition and excitement. Young men now had good reason forwanting to become successful hunters and fighters – it gave them the pick of thegirls.We note another interesting thing about human beings: that from babyhood onwardthey have a tendency to idealize possible mates. Little boys fall in love withthe prettiest girl in the class and daydream of being cowboys who rescue herfrom a band of marauding Indians. We do not know, of course, whether dogs andcats experience these emotions, but it seems unlikely. As far as we can see, itseems to have been sex that taught human beings to use the imagination.This means that, to a large extent, sex provides us with goals and objectives,even when there are no other stimuli. It is an “internal” factor in evolution, apsychological drive that operates most of the time. It could be the factor thatexplains why man became an “evolutionary animal”, an animal who went on strivingeven when he had a full belly.Kurtén seems to skirt these ideas when he remarks: “Another semi-solution [tothe problem of evolution] was the idea of an inner force of evolution, the élanvital, which would automatically carry us forward to new heights of nobility andspirituality. Unfortunately there is no evidence whatever for the existence ofsuch a force”. But sex is precisely such a force, as Goethe recognized when hewrote: “The eternal feminine draws us upwards and on”.In the previous paragraph Kurtén had dismissed another possibility: that byimproving themselves, human beings produce better offspring. This is known as“the inheritance of acquired characteristics” and is a theory of evolution thatwas suggested by Darwin’s predecessor, Lamarck. The simplest illustration of thedifference between the two theories is the problem of how the giraffe came tohave a long neck. According to Darwin, food shortages due to drought caused theoriginal short-necked giraffes to become extinct. But the giraffes who, bychance, happened to have longer necks, were able to reach the leaves on higherbranches and so survived. And eventually, all giraffes had long necks. Lamarck’sview was that when food became scarce, giraffes had to make strenuous efforts toreach higher branches, and these efforts gradually lengthened their necks.The discovery of the genes (by Mendel) made it look as if Darwin was right andLamarck wrong. For genetics seemed to prove that, even if a giraffe couldstretch its neck by effort, it could not transmit this long neck to itschildren, whose genes would ensure that they had short necks.In the twentieth century some biologists wondered whether perhaps genes do notmutate at random but in some way that is useful to the organism. But this theorywas disproved by the study of bacteria, which showed that genes always mutate atrandom. At least, healthy and well-nourished bacteria mutate at random, And thatis as one would expect. Why should they want to change if they are comfortableand well fed?But in the late 1980s Dr John Cairns of Harvard decided to study starvingbacteria and concluded that some of them could deliberately mutate to utilize anew food source. His results have been confirmed by Professor Barry Hall at theUniversity of Rochester, New York. When he deliberately starved his bacteria ofan amino acid essential to their survival, some of them mutated so they couldmanufacture the missing acid, until whole colonies of the mutated bacteria cameinto existence. It seems, then, that Lamarck was probably right after all. As,incidentally, was Samuel Butler, who objected to Darwin on precisely thesegrounds (see chapter 23).But even on a more down-to-earth level, the rigidly Darwinian view isquestionable. We all know that efforts made by parents can be passed on to theirchildren – that, for example, parents who have educated themselves can pass ontheir love of learning to their children. The truth is – as Kurtén recognizes –that the brain has a huge dormant capacity, which can be awakened by the rightstimuli. Man had developed a “modern size” brain long before he had books andmusic and philosophy to put in it.Kurtén also recognizes this when he says that our ancestors may have come downfrom the trees not because there was no longer enough food in the forests butbecause they were excited by the possibilities of the wide savannahs. Again, heis recognizing an evolutionary force, a craving for adventure, for a fuller andricher mode of existence. Not from the Apes is devoted to the thesis that man’suniqueness may date back as far as thirty-five million years, when our lineagesplit off from that of our cousins the apes. In the beginning, that split mayhave been due to natural selection and survival of the fittest. But in the pasthalf million years or so – perhaps far longer than that – the evolutionary urgeseems to have acquired its own momentum, so that even a convinced Darwinian likeSir Julian Huxley (grandson of T. H. Huxley) can state that man has finallybecome “the managing director of evolution”.We can see, then, that the whole Missing Link controversy was based on simplemisunderstanding. Darwin appeared to be saying that man is merely a moreintelligent ape and that his intelligence developed by chance. That clearlyimplies that individual effort counts for nothing. We struggle because we haveto struggle; that is part of the rat race. But our “higher aspirations” are somuch nonsense. We are mere apes.Human evolution proves the contrary. Man has become an evolutionary animal, ananimal who expects to change. Striving has become his second nature – a strivingbased upon his intense romanticism, the same romanticism that made the Greeksromanticize Helen of Troy, that made the troubadours romanticize their chosen“lady”, that made Malory romanticize Queen Guinevere and Isolde. And there isevery reason to expect our evolution to continue. The dormant capacity thatchanged Dartian man into modern man lies inside our heads. The brain developedthrough social intercourse and cooperation, but its excess size meant dormantcapacity. In other words, Homo sapiens developed a modern brain but had verylittle use for it.Brain physiologists tell us that, in spite of science, philosophy, art, andtechnology, modern man still only uses one-fifth of his brain capacity. When helearns to use the other four-fifths, there is every reason to believe that hewill be as different from modern man as you and I are from our australopithecineancestors."},{"pageContent":"36 Where is the Mona Lisa?The answer to the above question may seem self-evident: in the Louvre. But thematter is not quite as straightforward as it looks.The Mona Lisa is better known on the continent of Europe as “La Gioconda”, orthe smiling woman – the word means the same as the old English “jocund”. It waspainted, as everyone knows, by the great Italian artist Leonardo, who was bornin the little town of Vinci, near Florence, in 1452. Mona Lisa (Mona is shortfor Madonna) was a young married woman who was about twenty-four when Leonardomet her. She was the wife of a man twenty years her senior, the wealthyFrancesco del Giocondo, and when Leonardo started to paint her around 1500 shehad just lost a child. Leonardo’s biographer Vasari says that her husband had tohire jesters and musicians to make her smile during the early sittings.For some reason Leonardo became obsessed with her, and went on painting her forseveral years, always dissatisfied with his work. This has given rise to storiesthat he was in love with her, and even that she became his mistress; but thisseems unlikely. Leonardo was homosexual, and took a poor view of sex, writingwith Swiftian disgust: “The act of coitus and the members that serve it are sohideous that, if it were not for the beauty of faces . . . the human specieswould lose its humanity”. Yet there was something about Madonna Lisa that madehim strive to capture her expression for at least six years – possibly more. Hisbiographer Antonia Vallentin says she fascinated him more than any other womanhe met in his life. He gave the unfinished portrait to Mona Lisa’s husband whenhe left Florence in 1505, but still continued to work on it at intervals when hereturned.In his Lives of the Painters, Giorgio Vasari says that Leonardo worked at theMona Lisa for four years and left it unfinished. “This work is now in thepossession of Francis, king of France, at Fontainebleau . . .” And this, weassume, is the famous portrait now in the Louvre. Yet this raises a puzzlingquestion. Leonardo gave the portrait to the man who had commissioned it, MonaLisa’s husband, in 1505, and a mere forty or so years later, when Vasari waswriting, it is in the possession of Francis I of France. Surely the Giacondofamily would not part with a masterpiece so easily? Besides, the Louvre pictureis quite obviously finished . . .There is another interesting clue. In 1584 a historian of art, Giovanni PaoloLomazzo, published a book on painting, sculpture and architecture, in which herefers to “the Gioconda and the Mona Lisa”, as if they were two seperatepaintings. The book is dedicated to Don Carlos Emanuele, the Grand Duke ofSavoy, who was a great admirer of Leonardo – so it hardly seems likely that thiswas a slip of the pen . . .Two Giocondas? Then where is the other one? And, more important, who is thissecond Gioconda?The answer to the first question is, oddly enough: in the Louvre. Theworld-famous painting, which has been reproduced more often than any otherpainting in history, is almost certainly not the Mona Lisa that we have beentalking about.Then where is the painting of the woman who so obsessed Leonardo that he couldnot finish her portrait? There is evidence to show that this original Mona Lisawas brought from Italy in the mid-eighteenth century, and went into the statelyhome of a nobleman in Somerset. Just before the First World War it wasdiscovered by the art connoisseur Hugh Blaker in Bath, and he picked it up for afew guineas, and took it to his studio in Isleworth. Hence it became known asthe Isleworth Mona Lisa. It was bigger than the Louvre painting, and – moreimportant – was unfinished; the background has only been lightly touched in.Blaker was much impressed by it. The girl was younger and prettier than theLouvre Mona Lisa. And Blaker felt that this new Mona Lisa corresponded much moreclosely to Vasari’s description than the Louvre painting. Vasari rhapsodizedabout its delicate realism:> The eyes had that lustre and watery sheen which is always seen in real life,> and around them were those touches of red and the lashes which cannot be> represented without the greatest subtlety . . . The nose with its beautiful> nostrils, rosy and tender, seemed to be alive. The opening of the mouth,> united by the red of the lips to the flesh tones of the face, seemed not to be> coloured, but to be living flesh.> > Sir Kenneth Clark, quoting this passage in his book on Leonardo, asks: “Whowould recognise the submarine goddess of the Louvre”? To which Blaker would havereplied: “Ah, precisely”. But the description does fit the Isleworth Mona Lisa.There is another point that seems to establish beyond all doubt that Blaker’spicture is Leonardo’s Mona Lisa. The painter Raphael saw it in Leonardo’s studioabout 1504, and later made a sketch of it. This sketch shows two Grecian columnson either side – columns that can be found in the Isleworth Mona Lisa, but notin the Louvre painting.Blaker believes that the Isleworth Mona Lisa is a far more beautiful work, andmany art experts have agreed with him. It is true that the Louvre painting hasmany admirers; Walter Pater wrote a celebrated “purple passage” about it in TheRenaissance beginning “She is older than the rocks among which she sits; likethe vampire, she has been dead many times . . .”, and W. B. Yeats thought thisso beautiful that he divided it into lines of free verse and printed it as apoem in his Oxford Book of Modern Verse. On the other hand, the connoisseurBernard Berenson wrote about it: “What I really saw in the figure of Mona Lisawas the estranging image of woman beyond the reach of my sympathy or the ken ofmy interest . . . watchful, sly, secure, with a smile of anticipatedsatisfaction and a pervading air of hostile superiority . . .” He felt thebeauty of the Louvre Mona Lisa had been sacrificed to technique. No one couldsay this of the far more fresh and lively Isleworth Mona Lisa.But if the lady in the Louvre is not Leonardo’s Lisa del Giocondo, then who isshe? Here the most important clue is to be found in a document by AntonioBeatis, secretary to the Cardinal of Aragon. When Leonardo went to the court ofFrancis I in 1517 he was visited by the cardinal, and the secretary noted downthe conversation. The cardinal was shown works by Leonardo, including St John,the Madonna with St Anne, and “the portrait of a certain Florentine lady,painted from life at the instance of the late Magnifico Giuliano de Medici . ..”In her biography of Leonardo, Antonia Vallentin speculates that this work wasthe Mona Lisa, and asks: “Did Giuliano [de Medici] love Mona Lisa in hergirlhood . . . did he think with longing of her now she was married to Messerdel Giocondo, and had he commissioned Leonardo to paint her portrait”? But thisdelightful romantic bubble is shattered by a mere consideration of dates.Giuliano de Medici, brother of Lorenzo the Magnificent, master of Florence, wasmurdered in Florence cathedral in 1478. The plotters – mostly rival bankers –hoped to kill Lorenzo too, but Lorenzo was too quick for them. All this happenedin the year before Mona Lisa was born.Then who was the lady that Leonardo painted at the orders of Giuliano de Medici?Almost certainly the answer is Costanza d’Avalos, Giuliano’s mistress, a lady ofsuch pleasant disposition that she was known as “the smiling one” – la Gioconda. . .And so it would seem that the painting in the Louvre has been labelled “the MonaLisa” by a simple misunderstanding. Its subject is obviously a woman in herthirties not, like Mona Lisa del Giocondo, in her twenties. Leonardo took itwith him to France, and it went into the collection of Francis I, and eventuallyinto the Louvre. The unfinished Mona Lisa stayed in Italy, was brought toEngland, and was purchased by Hugh Blaker in 1914. In 1962 it was purchased forsome vast but undisclosed sum – undoubtedly amounting to millions – by a Swisssyndicate headed by the art-collector Dr Henry F. Pulitzer, and Pulitzer hassince written a short book, Where is the Mona Lisa?, setting out the claims ofhis own painting to be that of Madonna Lisa del Giocondo. Pulitzer’s contentionis simple. There are two Giocondas – for Madonna Lisa had a perfect right tocall herself by her husband’s name, with a feminine ending. But there is onlyone Mona Lisa. And that is not in the Louvre but in London."},{"pageContent":"37 “The Most Mysterious Manuscript in the World”The Voynich ManuscriptIt was in 1912 that an American dealer in rare books, Wilfred Voynich, heard ofa mysterious work that had been discovered in an old chest in the Jesuit schoolof Mondragone, in Frascati, Italy, and succeeded in buying it for an undisclosedsum. It was an octavo volume, six by nine inches, with 204 pages; it hadoriginally another 28 pages, but these are lost. It is written in cipher, whichat first glance looks like ordinary medieval writing. And the pages are coveredwith strange little drawings of female nudes, astronomical diagrams, and allkinds of strange plants in many colours.There was a letter accompanying the manuscript, dated 19 August 1666, andwritten by Joannes Marcus Marci, the rector of Prague University. It wasaddressed to the famous Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher – remembered todaymainly for some interesting experiments in animal hypnosis – and stated that thebook had been bought for 600 ducats by the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II ofPrague. Kircher was an expert on cryptography, having published a book on thesubject in 1663, in which he claimed to have solved the riddle of hieroglyphics.This in itself may be taken to indicate that Kircher was inclined to indulge inwishful thinking, since we know that it would be another century and a halfbefore Champollion succeeded in reading hieroglyphics. Kircher had apparentlyalready attempted to decipher a few pages of the book, sent to him by itsprevious owner, who had devoted his whole life to trying to decode it. Now hesent him the whole manuscript.We do not know how the manuscript came to be in Prague, but the likeliestpossibility is that it was taken there from England by the famous Elizabethan“magician” Dr John Dee, who went there in 1584; one writer speculates that Deemay have obtained it from the Duke of Northumberland, who had pillagedmonasteries at the behest of Henry VIII. The English writer Sir Thomas Brownesaid later that Dee’s son Arthur had spoken about “a book containing nothing buthieroglyphics” which he had studied in Prague. Marci believed the mysteriousbook to be by the thirteenth-century monk and scientist Roger Bacon.The Voynich manuscript (as it came to be known) is a baffling mystery because itlooks so straightforward; with its drawings of plants it looks like an ordinarymedieval “herbal”, a book describing how to extract healing drugs from plants.One would expect astronomical or astrological diagrams in a herbal, because theplants were often supposed to be gathered by the full moon, or when the stars orplanets were in a certain position.Kircher obviously had no success with the manuscript; he finally deposited it inthe Jesuit College in Rome, whence it came into the hands of the Jesuits ofFrascati.Voynich was fairly certain that the manuscript would not remain a mystery oncemodern scholars had a chance to study it. So he distributed photostats to anyonewho was interested. The first problem, of course, was to determine what languageit was in – Latin, Middle English, perhaps even Langue d’Oc. This should havebeen an easy task, since the plants were labelled, albeit in some sort of code.But most of the plants proved to be imaginary. Certain constellations could berecognized among the astronomical diagrams but again, it proved impossible totranslate their names out of code. Cryptanalysts tried the familiar method oflooking for the most frequent symbols and equating them with the most commonlyused letters of the alphabet; they had no difficulty recognizing 29 individualletters or symbols, but every attempt to translate these into a known languagewas a failure. What made it so infuriating was that the writing didn’t look likea code; it looked as if someone had sat down and written it as fluently as hismother tongue. Many scholars, cryptanalysts, linguists, astronomers, experts onBacon, offered to help; the Vatican Library offered to throw open its archivesto the researchers. Still the manuscript refused to yield up its secret – oreven one of its secrets.Then in 1921 a professor of philosophy from the University of Pennsylvania,William Romaine Newbold, announced that he had solved the code; he explained hisdiscovery before a meeting of the American Philosophical Society inPhiladelphia. What he had done, he explained, was to start by translating thesymbols into Roman letters, reducing them in the process from 29 to 17. Usingthe Latin conmuto (or commuto: to change) as a key word, he then went on toproduce no less than four more versions of the text, the last of which was(according to Newbold) a straightforward Latin text mixed up into anagrams.These merely had to be unscrambled and the result was a scientific treatisewhich revealed that Roger Bacon was one of the greatest intellects of all time.This had, of course, always been suspected. It was Bacon who had inspiredColumbus to seek out America by a passage in his Opus Majus in which hesuggested that the Indies could be reached by sailing westward from Spain. Inthe days of alchemy and a dogmatic and muddled science derived from Aristotle,Bacon advocated learning from nature by experiment and observation, and wasthrown into prison for his pains. In rejecting the authority of Aristotle he wasalso by implication rejecting the authority of the Church. In his City of God,St Augustine had warned Christians to shun science and intellectual inquiry as adanger to salvation. Roger Bacon, like his Elizabethan namesake Francis, couldsee that such an attitude was tantamount to intellectual suicide. Yet when allthis is said, it has to be admitted that Bacon was very much a man of his time,and that the Opus Majus is full of statements that a modern scientist wouldregard as gross errors and superstitions.But if Newbold was correct, Bacon was one of the greatest scientists beforeNewton. He had made a microscope and examined biological cells and spermatozoa –these were the tadpole-drawings in the margins – and had made a telescope longbefore Galileo; he had even recognized the Andromeda nebula as a spiral galaxy.Newbold translated a caption to what he claimed to be a sketch of the nebula:“In a concave mirror I saw a star in the form of a snail . . . between the navelof Pegasus, the girdle of Andromeda and the head of Cassiopeia”. (It is knownthat Bacon understood how to use a concave mirror as a burning-glass.) Newbolddeclared that he had no idea of what he would find by looking in the regionindicated, and was surprised to find that the “snail” was the Andromeda nebula.But in The Codebreakers cipher expert David Kahn has pointed out one of thebasic flaws in Newbold’s system. Newbold’s method depended on “doubling up” theletters of a word, so that, for example, “oritur” became or-ri-it-tu-ur, andthis text was solved with the aid of the key word “conmuto” and the addition ofa q. But how would this process be carried out in reverse – in other words, whenBacon was turning his original text into a cipher? Kahn says: “Many one-wayciphers have been devised; it is possible to put messages into cipher, but notto get them back out. Newbold’s seemed to be the only example extant of thereverse situation”.Newbold died in 1926, only sixty years old; two years later his friend Roland G.Kent published the results of Newbold’s labours in The Cipher of Roger Bacon. Itwas widely accepted – for example, by the eminent cultural historian ÉtienneGilson.But one scholar who had been studying Newbold’s system was far from convinced.He was Dr John M. Manly, a philologist who headed the department of English atChicago University, and who had become assistant to the great Herbert OsborneYardley – described as the greatest codebreaker in history – when US MilitaryIntelligence set up a cryptanalysis department in 1917. Manly had produced thedefinitive edition of Chaucer in eight volumes, comparing more than eightyversions of the medieval manuscript of the Canterbury Tales. One of his mostremarkable feats was the deciphering of a letter found in the baggage of aGerman spy named Lothar Witzke, who was captured in Nogales, Mexico, in 1918. Inthree days of non-stop application Manly had solved the twelve-step officialtransposition cipher, with multiple horizontal shiftings of three and fourletter groups finally laid out in a vertical transcription. In a military courthe was able to read aloud a message from the German minister in Mexicobeginning: “The bearer of this is a subject of the empire who travels as aRussian under the name of Pablo Waberski. He is a German secret agent . . .” Itwas the spy’s death warrant (although President Wilson commuted it to lifeimprisonment).Now Manly studied Newbold’s Cipher of Roger Bacon, and concluded that in spiteof his undoubted integrity, Newbold had been deceiving himself. The weak pointof the cipher was the anagramming process. Most sentences can be anagrammed intoa dozen other sentences, a method by which admirers of Francis Bacon have had nodifficulty proving that he wrote the plays of Shakespeare (see chapter 51). Witha sentence involving more than a hundred letters, there is simply no way ofguaranteeing that some particular rearrangement provides the only solution –David Kahn points out that the words “Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is withthee” can be anagrammed in thousands of different ways.Newbold had also made certain “shorthand signs” a basic part of his system ofinterpretation. When Manly looked at these through a powerful magnifying glasshe found out that they were not “shorthand” at all, only places where the inkhad peeled off the vellum. By the time he had pointed out dozens of cases inwhich Newbold had allowed his interpretation to be influenced by his owntwentieth-century assumptions, Manly had totally demolished Newbold’s claim tohave solved “the cipher of Roger Bacon”.Since that time, 1931, there have been many attempts to decipher the Voynichmanuscript. In 1933 a cancer specialist, Dr Leonell C. Strong, published his ownfragments of translation, and proved to his own satisfaction that the work was aherbal by an English scholar, Anthony Ascham; he even published a recipe for acontraceptive which apparently works. But Strong failed to explain the method bywhich he arrived at his translations, so they have never achieved wideacceptance.William F. Friedman, who organized a whole group of specialists to work on theproblem in the last year of the Second World War, was frustrated by the end ofthe war and the disbandment of his group. But Friedman pointed out that theVoynich manuscript differs from other codes in one basic respect. The inventorof a code attempts to frustrate would-be cryptanalysts by trying to removerepetitions that would give him away (for example, a repeated group of threeletters would almost certainly be “and” or “the”). The Voynich manuscriptactually has far more repetitions than an ordinary text. This led Friedman tohypothesize that the text is in some artificial language which, because of aneed for simplicity, would inevitably have more repetitions than a highlycomplex “natural” language. But this presupposes that Roger Bacon (or whoeverwrote the manuscript) was so anxious to conceal his meaning that he went to fargreater lengths than even a code-expert would consider reasonable. And for athirteenth-century monk, who had little reason to fear code-breakers, this seemsunlikely . . .And this, of course, is the very heart of the mystery. We do not know when themanuscript was written, or by whom, or in what language, but even if we knew theanswers to these questions it is difficult to think of any good reason forinventing such a baffling code. The earliest ciphers in the Vatican archive datefrom 1326 (when Roger Bacon was a boy) and these are merely “coded” namesrelating to the struggle between Ghibellines and Guelphs. These wererespectively supporters of the Holy Roman Emperor and the pope; the Ghibellinesare called Egyptians and the Guelphs Children of Israel. (It is easy to guesswhat side the inventor of the code was on.) The earliest Western “substitution”cipher dates from 1401. The first treatise on codes, the Polygraphia of JohannesTrithemius, was not printed until 1518, two years after the death of its author.So it is hard to imagine why Roger Bacon or anyone within a century of his deathshould have gone to so much trouble to invent a code of such apparentsophistication when something much simpler would have sufficed.Kahn offers one clue to why the author of a herbal (which is what the Voynichmanuscript looks most like) should want to conceal his meaning when he speaks ofone of the earliest encipherments, a tiny cuneiform tablet dating from about1500 BC. “It contains the earliest known formula for the making of glazes forpottery. The scribe, jealously guarding his professional secret, used cuneiformsigns . . . in their least common values”. The author of the Voynich manuscriptmay have been a highly skilled professional herbalist who wrote down his secretsfor his own use and those of his pupils, and was determined to keep them out ofthe hands of rivals.This view would have struck the antiquarian bookseller Hans Kraus as altogethertoo commonplace. When Ethel Voynich died at the age of ninety-six, in 1960,Kraus purchased the manuscript from her executors and put it up for sale at$160,000; he explained that he thought that it could contain information thatmight provide new insights into the record of man, and that if it could bedeciphered it might be worth a million dollars. No one took it at that price,and Kraus finally gave it to Yale University in 1969, where it now lies,awaiting the inspiration of some master-cryptographer."},{"pageContent":"38 Joan NorkotThe Case of the Bleeding CorpseWhen Sir John Mainard, known as “a gentleman of great note and judgment of thelaw”, died in 1690, there was found among his papers an account of an incrediblecase in which a woman’s corpse accused her murderers. The whole document wasprinted in The Gentleman’s Magazine of July 1851, a copy having been taken by alawyer named Hunt. The events it describes are so extraordinary that themagazine took the precaution of heading it: “Singular Instance of Superstition”.Yet Mainard’s account makes it clear that the event was witnessed by a crowd ofpeople standing in a graveyard, including two clergymen.The trial in which the evidence was heard took place at Hereford Assizes inHerefordshire in “the fourth year of the reign of King Charles I” (1629), morethan sixty years before Mainard’s death. Mainard’s account is printed in full inthe Reverend Montague Summers’s The Vampire in Europe (1929). An account writtenby Valentine Dyall in Unsolved Mysteries (1954)16[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2237172] is also basedon the court records, which it admits are “tantalizingly scanty”. The accounthas an irritating lack of dates, and even of names, but the general outline isclear enough.There had been, it seems, some trouble between Arthur Norkot and his wife, Joan,one suggestion being that he suspected her of infidelity. It may have beensimply overcrowding that caused their disagreements, for Joan lived in atwo-room cottage with her husband and baby, as well as with her mother-in-law,Mary Norkot, and her sister and brother-in-law, Agnes and John Okeman.One morning Joan was found dead in her bed, with her throat cut; the baby waslying – unharmed – beside her. A bloodstained knife was sticking in the barefloorboards.Her husband had been away from home that night, according to the relatives. Hehad gone to visit friends near Tewkesbury. The others swore that it wasimpossible that Joan Norkot could have been murdered, for anyone entering thecottage would have had to pass through the room in which they slept beforeentering her bedroom.At the inquest that followed, it was admitted that there had been “a great dealof trouble” between husband and wife and that Joan had been in “a sour temperwith some despondency” before she went to bed. But when the knife was tried inthe small hole in the floor that its point had made, it was observed that itshandle pointed toward the door and that it was some feet from the bed. If Joanhad thrown the knife down after cutting her throat, surely the handle would havebeen pointing toward the bed? In spite of this, a verdict of felo-de-se(suicide) was returned, and Joan was duly buried, presumably in unhallowedground.It may have been the knife evidence that caused unpleasant rumors to circulate(Mainard merely says “observations of divers circumstances”). The coroner wasasked to reopen the case and agreed to a reinvestigation. The body was exhumed,and it was found that the neck was broken. Clearly, the woman could not havebroken her own neck. It was noted, moreover, that there was more blood on thefloor of the room than on the bed, which seemed odd if Joan had cut her throatin bed. Moreover, Arthur Norkot’s alibi collapsed when his friends in Tewkesburydeclared that they had not seen him for three years. Altogether, the evidenceagainst the accused was so strong that the prosecution decided not to mentionthe strangest and most incredible piece of evidence at their trial. But for somereason, the jury did not think it was conclusive, and the four were acquitted.The judge, a man named Harvey, was incredulous and “let fall his opinion that itwere better an appeal were brought than so foul a murder should escapeunpunished”.This could only be done in the name of Joan Norkot’s baby. Accordingly, the fourwere retried in front of Justice Harvey. And it was at this retrial that anameless clergyman – the minister of the parish – presented the evidence thatthe corpse had accused her murderers. The incredulous judge asked if anyone elsehad seen it, and the old man replied, “I believe the whole company saw it”.What had happened, it seemed, was this: Thirty days after she was buried, thebody of Joan Norkot was taken from the grave and the coffin placed beside it,almost certainly on trestles. It must have been an unpleasant sight, since thesevered jugular vein would have drained her of most of her blood. Then, inaccordance with an ancient superstition, each of the accused was asked to touchthe body. According to the superstition, if a corpse is touched by its murderer,the wounds will bleed afresh. Mrs Okeman fell to her knees and prayed to God togrant proof of their innocence. Then, like the others, she was asked to touchthe corpse.The clergyman deposed the following:> The appellers did touch the dead body, whereupon the brow of the dead, which> was all a livid or carrion colour . . . began to have a dew or gentle sweat,> which reached down in drops upon the face, and the brow turned and changed to> a lively and fresh colour, and the dead opened one of her eyes and shut it> again, and this opening the eye was done several times. She likewise thrust> out the ring- or marriage finger three times and pulled it in again, and the> finger dropt blood from it on to the grass.> > It was at this point that the judge expressed his doubts, and the clergyman thenturned to his brother, the minister of the next parish, who had also beenpresent. The brother repeated the evidence: that the brow had begun to perspire,that its colour had changed from livid (i.e., a bruised colour) to fresh andnormal, that the eye had opened, and that the finger had three times made apointing motion. (This seems to have been taken to imply that only three of thefour accused were guilty.)What followed was a repetition of the main evidence that had already beenpresented at the first trial. The body of Joan Norkot lay “in a composed manner”in the bed, the bedclothes undisturbed and her baby beside her. This in itselfwas evidence enough to convict someone of murder, for it was obviouslyimpossible that she could cut her throat elsewhere in the room – the floor washeavily bloodstained – then lie down and carefully cover herself up. Moreover,the broken neck seemed to indicate that considerable force had been used againsther. It is just about possible for a person to break her own neck but not to cuther throat afterwards. It is equally impossible to cut the throat first and thenbreak the neck.What had happened, quite clearly; was that the husband and wife had quarreledviolently and that he had ended with his hands around her throat. She had fallenand struck her head against something, breaking her neck. Now in a panic – forthe death was almost certainly accidental – Arthur Norkot conferred with hismother and sister about what could be done, with his brother-in-law, JohnOkeman, an unwilling participant. To hide the bruises on Joan’s throat and herbroken neck, the solution seemed to be to cut her throat. But they were in sucha panic that they did this on the floor of the room instead of in the bed. ThenJoan Norkot was arranged in her bed and the baby – who had probably sleptthrough it all – placed beside her. Someone left a bloodstained fingerprint andthumbprint on her hand. (Chief Justice Hyde, who heard the case, seems to havebeen so inexperienced in such matters that he had to ask how they coulddistinguish the prints of the left hand from those of the right.) And as theywere leaving the room, someone tossed the bloodstained knife – which probablylay near the door – back into the room, so it stuck in the floor a few feet fromthe bed. Then Arthur Norkot hastily washed off his bloodstains and took hisleave, instructing his mother to “find” the body the next morning and explainthat her son was away in Tewkesbury.It is clear that the attempt to make the murder look like suicide was so bungledthat a moderately intelligent investigator could have seen through it rightaway. But in 1629 scientific crime investigation was unknown. It would be almostanother two centuries before Britain even had a police force. If someone wassuspected of a crime, the standard method of “investigation” was to torture himuntil he either confessed or died. No one, it seemed, felt that the evidenceagainst the Norkot family was sufficiently strong for an accusation.This brings us to the most difficult question of all. Did the corpse really“revive” and accuse the criminals? Any reader who has studied chapter 42 in thisvolume may concede that the evidence for the “survival” of the human personalityis at least plausible. It would even seem that spirits can, under certaincircumstances, “possess” the living and cause unexplained movements of materialobjects (“poltergeist” effects). And in one extraordinary case, the spirit of amurder victim seems to have returned to accuse her killer (see chapter 5). Itseems just as conceivable that Joan Norkot was momentarily able to “repossess”her old body in order to accuse her attackers. But it must be immediatelyadmitted that there are no other known examples in the history of paranormalresearch.In his Unsolved Mysteries, Valentine Dyall suggests a commonsense solution: thatthe two doctors who presided over the exhumation decided to shock the suspectsinto a public confession. A tiny pouch of some dark red fluid was stuck to herleft hand and a fine thread attached to its stopper. The thread was passedthrough the wedding ring. Another thread was tied to one of the eyelashes. Thenboth threads were attached to the coffin handles. When the “touching test” wassuggested, each doctor (standing on either side of the coffin) pulled on athread. The eyelid twitched, the ring-finger jerked, and the “blood” wasreleased so that it ran down the side of the corpse and out of a crack in thebottom of the badly made coffin. The bleeding wound “proved” that Joan had beenmurdered by someone who had just touched her. The evidence states that someoneput his finger into the blood and testified that it was real; but this, Dyallsuggests, would obviously have been one of the doctors themselves.It might be just possible, although one would think that in broad daylight thethreads would surely have been visible. And what about the evidence of bothclergymen that the face lost its “dead” colour and seemed to come to life? Pureimagination? That is also possible – except that they claimed that this was thefirst thing that happened, before the eye opened or the finger twitched. Theimagination theory would be more acceptable if the face had “come to life” afterthe corpse “winked”.Whatever the explanation, the evidence of the two clergymen convinced the court.Arthur Norkot, together with his mother and sister, was sentenced to death. Forreasons that Sir John Mainard (who was Sergeant Mainard when he took part in thetrial) does not explain, the jury decided to acquit Norkot’s brother-in-law,John Okeman. When sentenced, all three repeated, “I did not do it”. In fact,Agnes Okeman was reprieved when she was discovered to be pregnant. Mary and JohnNorkot were hanged. Mainard concludes: “I inquired if they confessed anything atexecution, but they did not, as I was told”."},{"pageContent":"39 The Oera Linda BookThe Forgotten History of a Lost ContinentIn 1876 there appeared in London a bewildering work entitled the Oera Linda Bookand subtitled From a Manuscript of the Thirteenth Century. It was published byTrubner and Co., one of the most respectable names in publishing, so there couldbe no suggestion that it was a hoax. And the fact that the original text inFrisian (the language of Friesland, a part of northern Holland) was publishedopposite the English translation offered scholars the opportunity to check forthemselves. Yet if the claims of the Oera Linda Book were true, then the historyof the ancient world had to be completely rewritten. It suggested that in thethird millennium BC, at about the time the Great Pyramid and the originalStonehenge were built, there was a great island continent in northern Europethat was inhabited by a highly civilized race. In 2193 BC this island wasdestroyed, like the legendary Atlantis, by some immense catastrophe. But enoughof its inhabitants escaped to carry their civilization elsewhere – includingancient Egypt and Crete. In fact, the Oera Linda Book suggested that thelegendary King Minos of Crete (creator of the Labyrinth) was a Frisian and thatthe same ancient civilization gave democracy to Athens.All this seemed so extraordinary and so confusing that the first reaction ofDutch and German scholars was to suggest that the book was a forgery. Yet theyseem to have agreed that it was not a modern forgery and that it was probably acentury to a century and a half old. But that would date it roughly to the1730s. And it is hard to imagine why anyone would have wanted to forge such adocument in the 1730s. A century later, in the Romantic era, there would havebeen some point in creating this mysterious narrative with its marvelous hintsof a golden age in the remote past. But it is virtually impossible to imaginewhy, in that rather dull era of Frederick the Great and the Prince ofOrange-Nassau (dull, at any rate, from the literary point of view), anyoneshould have bothered. It is true that a famous forgery of “ancient” Gaelicpoetry – the works of “Ossian”, actually written by James MacPherson – becameimmensely popular in England and on the Continent in the 1760s; but if the OeraLinda Book was inspired by MacPherson’s Ossian, why did the forger put it in adrawer and forget about it until 1848, when it finally saw the light of day?According to its Introduction, written in 1871, the Oera Linda Book had beenpreserved in the Linden (or Linda) family from “time immemorial” and was writtenin a peculiar script that looked a little like Greek. It began with a letterfrom one “Liko oera Linda”, dated AD 803, in which he begged his son to preservethe book “with body and soul”, since it contained the history of their peoples.The manuscript was inherited by a certain C. Over de Linden – a modernizedversion of Oera Linda – in 1848, and a learned professor named Verwijs asked ifhe could look at it. He immediately recognized its language as ancient Fries, aform of Dutch. The manuscript examined by Verwijs had been copied in 1256 onpaper manufactured from cotton and written in a black ink that did not containiron (which eventually turns brown).According to the Introduction (by Dr J. O. Ottema), the Oera Linda Book recordsthe history of the people of a large island called Atland, which was roughly onthe same latitude as the British Isles, in what is now the North Sea (in otherwords, off the coast of modern Holland). Dr Ottema seems to think that Atland isPlato’s Atlantis,17[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2237351] which mostcommentators have placed somewhere in the mid-Atlantic. But since Plato saysonly that it was “beyond the Pillars of Hercules” (what is now Gibraltar),Ottema could be correct.According to the Oera Linda Book, Atland had an excellent climate and anabundance of food. And since its rulers were wise and deeply religious, it was apeaceful and contented land. Its legendary founder was a half-mythical womannamed Frya – obviously a version of the Nordic Freya, the moon goddess, whosename means “a lady”. (In the same way, frey means “a lord”.) Its peopleworshiped one God, under the (to us) unpronounceable name of Wr-alda. Frya wasone of three sisters, the other two being named Lyda and Finda. Lyda wasdark-skinned and became the founder of the black races; Finda was yellow-skinnedand became the founder of the yellow races. Frya was white.All of this is obviously legend. But the Oera Linda Book then goes on todescribe historical events.In the year 2193 BC, a great catastrophe of some sort struck Atland, and it wasoverwhelmed by the sea. Logic suggests that the same catastrophe must havestruck the British Isles, since they were so close; but if Atland was as low andflat as Holland, we can understand why it was submerged. (The Dogger Bank, whereAtland would have been situated, is the shallowest area of the North Sea.)According to Plato, Atlantis had been destroyed in a great catastrophe more thannine thousand years earlier. But one modern authority, Professor A. G.Galanopoulos, has argued that all the figures associated with Atlantis (whichwere recorded by Egyptian priests) were about ten times too great – for example,Plato says that the moat around the royal city was ten thousand stades (morethan a thousand miles) long, which would make the royal city about three hundredtimes larger than Greater London or Los Angeles. If we divide nine thousandyears by ten, we get nine hundred. The Egyptian priests told the Athenianlawgiver Solon about Atlantis around 600 BC, which would make the date for thedestruction of Atlantis about 1500 BC (nine hundred years earlier). This isroughly the date of the explosion of the volcano of Santorini (north of Crete)that devastated most of the Mediterranean, and Galanopoulos argues that theisland of Santorini was Atlantis. The only problem is that Plato placed Atlantisbeyond the Pillars of Hercules – in which case, Atland is certainly a contender.Another reason for the relative neglect of the Oera Linda Book is that itsnarrative seems so unfamiliar and its names are so strange; in this respect itresembles the Book of Mormon or that extraordinary work entitled Oahspe, whichwas “dictated” to an American medium named J. B. Newbrough at roughly the sametime the Oera Linda Book was published. But these two documents claim some kindof “divine” origin, while the Oera Linda Book purports to be a historicaldocument.Nevertheless, the people mentioned in it are not pure invention. A later bookspeaks at length about a warrior named Friso, an officer of Alexander the Great(born 356 BC), who is described in other Nordic chronicles. (The Oera Linda Bookalso speaks at length of Alexander the Great.) These chronicles state that Frisocame from India. The Oera Linda Book says that Friso was descended from aFrisian colony that settled in the Punjab about 1550 BC; moreover, the Greekgeographer Strabo mentions this strange “Indian” tribe, referring to them by thename Germania. The Oera Linda Book even mentions Ulysses and recounts how hewent in search of a sacred lamp – a priestess had foretold that if he could findit, he would become king of all Italy. After an unsuccessful attempt to buy thelamp from its priestess-custodian, the “Earth Mother” (using treasures lootedfrom Troy), he sailed to a place named Walhallagara (which sounds oddly likeValhalla) and had a love affair with a priestess named Kalip (obviouslyCalypso), with whom he stayed for several years “to the scandal of all who knewit”. From Kalip he obtained a sacred lamp of the kind he wanted, but it did himno good, for he was shipwrecked and had to be picked up, naked and destitute, byanother ship.This fragment of Greek history, tossed into the Oera Linda Book is interestingfor two reasons. It dates this adventure of Ulysses about 1188, which is aboutfifty years later than modern archaeology would date the fall of Troy (seechapter 23). But the Oera Linda Book could be correct. And it states that thenymph Calypso was actually a burgtmaagd (a word meaning “borough maid” –literally, a virgin priestess in charge of vestal virgins). This is consistentwith the central claim of the Oera Linda Book: that after the “deluge”, theFrisians sailed the globe and became the founders of Mediterranean civilization,as well as settling in India. It is obvious why scholars have ignored the book.To take it seriously would mean virtually rewriting ancient history. If, forexample, we accept that Calypso’s island, Walhallagara, was the island ofWalcheren, in the North Sea (as the commentary on the Oera Linda Book claims itwas), then Ulysses sailed right out of the Mediterranean. It is certainlysimpler to accept Homer’s version of the story.After nearly a century of neglect, the Oera Linda Book was rediscovered by anEnglish scholar named Robert Scrutton. In his fascinating book The OtherAtlantis, Scrutton tells how, in 1967, he and his wife – a “sensitive” withstrong psychometric powers18[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2237518] – were walkingover Dartmoor when she experienced a terrifying vision of a flood: great greenwaves higher than the hills pouring across the land.Eight years later he found legends of a great deluge in ancient poetry known asthe Welsh Triads (which also speak of King Arthur). The Triads explain that longbefore the Kmry (the Welsh) came to Britain, there was a great flood thatdepopulated the entire island. One ship survived, and those who sailed in itsettled in the “Summer Land” peninsula (which Scrutton identifies as the Crimea– still called Krym – in the Black Sea). These peoples decided to seek otherlands, because their peninsula was subject to flooding. One portion went toItaly and the other across Germany and France and into Britain. (In fact, thisaccount does not contradict the little we know about the mysterious peoplecalled the Celts, whose origin is unknown.) So the Kmry came back to Britain –probably around 600 BC – and brought their Druidic religion, which involvedhuman sacrifice.Scrutton went on to uncover many other legends concerning a great catastrophe inancient Welsh poetry and in the Icelandic Eddas (where it was known asRagnarok). It is worth mentioning that Ignatius Donnelly, whose book Atlantis:The Antediluvian World19[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2237720] caused asensation in 1882, went on to write another classic, Ragnarok: The Age of Fireand Ice in the following year; in this volume he attempted to study catastrophelegends of the northern hemisphere and created a remarkable theory ofcontinental drift that later proved to be totally accurate.Scrutton’s research led him to rediscover the Oera Linda Book and to becomeabsorbed in its strange yet credible account of ancient history. The firstquestion he asked himself was: what was the precise nature of the catastrophethat destroyed Atland and depopulated Britain? In The Other Atlantis (1977) hesuggests that it was a giant meteor or asteroid that struck the earth somewherein the region of the North Pole; the force of the explosion had the effect oftilting the earth’s axis into a more upright position, so lands that hadformerly had long, hot summers now developed arctic conditions. The Greeks havetheir legends of the Hyperboreans, a people who live in idyllic conditions inthe far north, and Scrutton identifies these with the Atlanders.This projectile, Scrutton suggests, produced the crater known as the ArcticOcean – which, he claims, would look like one of the enormous craters of themoon if its water was drained away. Many stones and rocks that modern scientistsbelieve were moved by glaciers were actually, Scrutton suggests, hurled by theexplosion. But this part of his theory is open to a simple objection. Theopening section of the Oera Linda Book says that during the whole summer beforethe flood “the sun had been hid behind the clouds, as if unwilling to look uponthe earth”. There was perpetual calm, and “a damp mist hung like a wet sail overthe houses and marshes”. Then, “in the midst of this stillness, the earth beganto tremble as if she was dying. The mountains opened to vomit forth fire andflames”.That seems clearly to be a description of a volcanic catastrophe of the kindthat is supposed to have destroyed Atlantis, not a tidal wave caused by ameteor. Does this mean that the meteor theory must be abandoned? Notnecessarily. A meteor that struck in the region of the North Pole wouldcertainly have produced a tidal wave, but if the polar cap itself was coveredwith ice, it may not have been great enough to cause a tidal wave that wouldsubmerge Britain and Atland. But the volcanic activity that would almostcertainly follow such an impact could produce a mighty tidal wave, like the onecaused by the explosion of Santorini (and later of Krakatoa).Scrutton also mentions a description in the Finnish epic the Kalevala of a timewhen the sun vanished from the sky and the world became frozen and barren, andquotes a modern introduction that places this at a period when the Magyars(Hungarians) and the Finns were still united – at least three thousand yearsago.Scrutton believes that the “maps of the ancient sea kings” described byProfessor Charles Hapgood (and discussed in chapter 49) confirm his view of thecatastrophe that destroyed Atland. Once again, there is an objection. Coresamples taken in Queen Maud Land (in the Antarctic) show that the last time theSouth Pole was unfrozen was around 4000 BC So the great maritime civilizationthat Hapgood believes was responsible for the “ancient maps” must haveflourished before then.This, of course, does not rule out a catastrophe some two thousand years later –perhaps the civilization of Atland lasted for two thousand years, like that ofthe Egyptians. But if Hapgood is correct, and his great maritime civilizationexisted more than six thousand years ago and then was either forgotten ordestroyed in a great catastrophe, it certainly becomes difficult to reconcilethe two theories.There is, however, one way of reconciling them that is no bolder – or moreabsurd – than the theories themselves. Hapgood believed that the ancient mapswere evidence of a worldwide maritime civilization that existed long beforeAlexander the Great. Let us, then, posit the existence of such a civilizationthat began sometime after the last great ice age – say, around 10,000 BC. Sixthousand years later this civilization is highly developed in the Antarctic andin Atland. In other parts of the world – like the Middle East – it is lesshighly developed, although there are already cities, and the plow has beendeveloped. For unknown reasons – no one knows what causes ice ages – the coldreturns, and the Antarctic civilization freezes up, so its peoples are forced togo elsewhere – notably to Egypt. The Atland civilization, being in moretemperate latitudes, is not affected. Then, in 2192 BC, comes the “greatcatastrophe” that tilted the earth’s axis. Now, like the inhabitants of theSouth Pole, the Atlanders are also forced to move – and of course they movesouth, to regions that have not been affected by the great catastrophe – likeIndia and the Mediterranean. If this scenario is correct, then both Hapgood andScrutton could be right.One thing seems clear: that the ancient maps prove the existence of a greatmaritime civilization that flourished before Alexander the Great. Like the maps,the Oera Linda Book also points to the existence of such a civilization. Even ifthe Oera Linda Book proved to be a forgery, the evidence of the maps would beunaffected. But at the present time, there is no evidence that it is a forgery.In this case, it deserves to be reprinted in a modern edition and carefullystudied by historians – as well as read by the general public for itsfascinating tales of murder and battle. If it proves to be genuine, the OeraLinda Book could revolutionize our view of world history."},{"pageContent":"40 The “People of the Secret”Early in 1883 a book called Esoteric Buddhism caused an immediate sensation, andquickly went into a second edition. It was by a slender, balding little mancalled Alfred Percy Sinnett, editor of India’s most influential newspaper thePioneer. What caused the excitement was Sinnett’s claim, on the very first page,that he had obtained his information from “hidden masters”, men who lived in thehigh mountains of Tibet and who were virtually immortal. Coming from the editorof a newspaper that was regarded as the mouthpiece of the British government inIndia, this could not be dismissed as “occultist” lunacy. Such a man deservedserious attention when he declared:> For reasons that will appear as the present explanations proceed, the very> considerable block of hitherto secret teaching this volume contains, has been> conveyed to me, not only without conditions of the usual kind, but to the> express end that I might convey it in my turn to the world at large.> > Many people took Sinnett very seriously indeed. The poet W.B. Yeats read thebook and handed it to his friend Charles Johnston, who was so impressed that herushed off to London for permission to set up a Dublin branch of theTheosophical Society, the publisher of Sinnett’s book.It was almost three years later that the general public learned how Sinnett hadobtained his “hitherto secret teaching”, and the sceptics felt confirmed intheir cynicism. In October 1880 Sinnett and his wife had played host to thatremarkable lady Madame Blavatsky, who told him that most of her knowledge hadbeen obtained from her “secret Masters” who lived in the Himalayas. Sheconvinced Sinnett of her genuineness by a series of minor miracles. On a picnic,when an unexpected guest had turned up, she ordered another guest to dig in thehillside with a table knife; he unearthed a cup and saucer of the same patternas the rest of the china. When a woman remarked casually that she wished shecould find a lost brooch Madame Blavatsky told the other guests to go and searchin the garden; the missing brooch was found in a flower-bed wrapped in paper.And when Sinnett expressed his desire to correspond directly with the “Masters”Madame Blavatsky promised to do what she could, and a few days later Sinnettfound lying in his desk the first of what were to become known as “the Mahatmaletters”. It was from this series of letters that Sinnett obtained his knowledgeof “esoteric Buddhism”.Unfortunately, this information about the Mahatma letters was revealed in areport on Theosophy published by the Society for Psychical Research towards theend of 1885, and the rest of the report was damning. It was the result of aninvestigation by a young man named Richard Hodgson, who had talked to MadameBlavatsky’s housekeepers and learned that most of the “miracles” werefraudulent; their most convincing demonstration was to cause a letter –addressed to Hodgson and referring to the conversation they had only just had –to fall out of the air above his head. Hodgson’s report had the effect oftotally destroying Madame Blavatsky’s credibility, and demolishing the myth ofthe “hidden Masters” in Tibet.Having said all this, it is necessary to admit that there are still a number ofthings to be said in Madame Blavatsky’s favour. The evidence of many observersshows that she was undoubtedly a genuine “spirit medium”. ConstanceWachtmeister, a countess who became Madame Blavatsky’s factotum in 1884, foundit at first a little unnerving. She was sharing a room (divided by a screen)with Madame Blavatsky, and as soon as Madame was asleep the raps would begin,continuing at intervals of ten minutes until about 6 a.m. A lamp was burning byMadame Blavatsky’s bed; on one of the first nights the countess was kept awakeand slipped behind the screen to extinguish it. She had only just got back intobed when the lamp was relit. Madame Blavatsky was obviously asleep, and in anycase the countess would have heard the scrape of a match or tinder box. Threetimes she extinguished it; three times it promptly relit itself. The raps alsocontinued. The third time she put it out, she saw a disembodied brown handturning up the wick. She woke Madame Blavatsky, who looked pale and shaken, andexplained that she had been “with the Masters” and that it was dangerous toawaken her suddenly.Charles Johnston describes how he sat watching HPB (as her admirers called her),tapping her fingers idly on a table-top. Then she raised her hand a foot or soabove the table and continued the tapping movement; the sounds continued to comefrom the table. Then she turned towards Johnston, and began to send the “astraltaps” on to the back of his hand. “I could both feel and hear them. It wassomething like taking sparks from the prime conductor of an electric machine;or, better still, perhaps, it was like spurting quicksilver through yourfingers”.It is of course possible that all this was fraudulent; but it seems unlikely. Ifwe can accept the hypothesis that there are genuine mediums that is, mediums whoeither possess, or are possessed by, certain “magical” powers then it seemsfairly certain that Madame Blavatsky was such a person. And if we can acceptthat there are genuine mediums, then the next question is whether their powersare the result of some mysterious activity of the unconscious mind, or whetherthey involve some external force – some emanation of the “collectiveunconscious”, or even “spirits”. Most students of the paranormal end up byconceding (however reluctantly) that there does seem to be some external force,although understandably many of them find it impossible to concede the existenceof spirits.The psychiatrist Wilson Van Dusen, who studied hundreds of patients sufferingfrom hallucinations in the Mendocino State Hospital, reached the remarkableconclusion that the nature of the hallucinations had been accurately describedby the eighteenth-century mystic Emanuel Swedenborg. They seemed to fall intotwo types, which he calls “higher order” and “lower order”. Lower-orderhallucinations seemed to be stupid and repetitive; they “are similar to drunkenbums at a bar who like to tease and torment just for the fun of it”. Buthigher-order hallucinations seemed “more likely to be symbolic, religious,supportive, genuinely instructive”. A gas-fitter experienced a higher-orderhallucination of a beautiful woman who showed him thousands of symbols. VanDusen was able to hold a dialogue with this “woman”, with the help of thepatient, and after the conversation the patient asked for just one clue to whatthey had been talking about.If we can accept this much, then we can also see that Madame Blavatsky’s “secretmasters” may not have been her own invention. She told Constance Wachtmeisterthat the raps that resounded from above her bed were a “psychic telegraph” thatlinked her to the Masters, who watched over her body while she slept. If we arewilling to concede that the Masters may have been what Swedenborg calls“angels”, or what Van Dusen calls higher-order hallucinations, then it suddenlyceases to be self-evident that HPB was an old fraud. We have at least toconsider the hypothesis that something was going on which is slightly morecomplicated.Madame Blavatsky was not the inventor of the idea of secret masters; the notionis part of an ancient “occult” tradition. The composer Cyril Scott, who was alsoan “occultist”, writes in his Outline of Modern Occultism (1935) of the basictenets of “Occult science”:> Firstly, the occultist holds that Man is in process of evolving from> comparative imperfection to much higher states of physical and spiritual> evolution. Secondly, that the evolutionary process in all its phases is> directed by a Great Hierarchy of Intelligences who have themselves reached> these higher states.> > Now, many modern thinkers would agree that man is involved in an evolutionaryprocess that involves his mind as well as his body, and many would insist thatthe process is not entirely a matter of Darwinian mechanisms (see, for example,the contributors to Arthur Koestler’s Beyond Reductionism). But it is clearly avery long step from this kind of evolutionism to the belief that theevolutionary process is being directed by “higher intelligences”.Such a step was, in fact, taken (on purely scientific grounds) by thecybernetician David Foster, in his book The Intelligent Universe. Foster’s basicassertion is simply that, to the eye of the cyberneticist, evolution seems tosuggest some intelligent intervention. Cybernetics is basically the science ofmaking machines behave as if they are intelligent – as does, for example, amodern washing machine, which performs a number of complex processes, heatingwater up to a certain temperature, washing the clothes for a certain period,rinsing them, spin-drying, etc. But these processes are “programmed” into themachine, and can be selected by merely turning a dial, or inserting a kind ofplastic biscuit – each of whose edges contains a different programme – into aslot. An acorn could be regarded as a device containing the programme for anoak-tree. But to the eye of a cybernetician the acorn, like the plastic biscuit,suggests some form of programming. Could an acorn be programmed solely byDarwinian natural selection? Foster points out that one basic rule aboutcomputer-programming is that the intelligence that does the programming must beof a higher, more complex, order than the programme itself. Similarly, in orderto drive a car or use an electric typewriter my mind must work faster than themachine; if the machine goes faster than my mind, the result will be disaster orconfusion. In cybernetics, blue light could be a programme for red light, butnot vice versa on the same principle that Dickens can create Mr Pickwick, but aMr Pickwick could not create a Dickens. And Foster argues that the energiesinvolved in programming DNA would need to be higher than any form of energyfound on earth. He argues that the process would require energies of the sameorder as cosmic rays. Such an argument obviously implies that the complexity oflife on earth can only be accounted for by some intelligence “out there”.We may reject this argument, pointing out that “instinct” may create acomplexity that looks like superintelligence. Mathematical prodigies, who canwork out problems of bewildering complexity within seconds, are often ofotherwise low intelligence. There is no evolutionary necessity for the humanbrain to work out such problems; so why has the brain developed such a power?The physiologist would reply: as a kind of by-product, just as a simplecalculating device like an abacus could be used to multiply numbers far beyondthe grasp of the human imagination. But those who believe that evolution isbasically purposive use such examples as mathematical prodigies to argue thatthe evolution of man’s higher faculties cannot be explained in purely Darwinianterms.Since Madame Blavatsky (who died in 1891) there have been many “occultists” (Iuse the word in its broadest sense, as meaning those who are interested in theparanormal) who have believed that they were in contact with higherintelligences. Alice Bailey became an active member of the Theosophical Societyafter the death of Madame Blavatsky, and was convinced she was in touch withSinnett’s “Mahatma” (it means “great soul”) Koot Hoomi. In 1919, disgusted bythe power struggles within the society, she founded her own group, and produceda large number of books dictated by an entity called “the Tibetan”.The Rev. Stainton Moses, an early member of the Society for Psychical Research,used “automatic writing” to produce large quantities of a script that waspublished after his death under the title Spirit Teachings. Although Mosespublished extracts from these in Light, he was too embarrassed to admit thatsome of the “spirits” who dictated them claimed to be Plato, Aristotle and halfa dozen Old Testament prophets. Yet there was strong evidence that these scriptswere not simply the product of his own unconscious mind. On one occasion Mosesasked the “spirit” if it would go to the bookcase, select the last book but oneon the second shelf, and read out the last paragraph on page 94. The spirit didthis correctly. Moses was still not convinced, so the spirit selected its ownbook. It dictated a passage about Pope, then told Moses precisely where to findit; when Moses took the book off the shelf, it opened at the right page. Thespirit dictated these passages while the books remained closed on the shelf.In 1963 two Americans, Jane Roberts and her husband Rob, began experimentingwith an ouija board, inspired to some extent by “Patience Worth” (see chapter62). Various personalities identified themselves and gave messages; then after awhile a character who identified himself as “Seth” began to come through:> It was immediately apparent that the board’s messages had suddenly increased> in scope and quality. We found ourselves dealing with a personality who was of> superior intelligence, a personality with a distinctive humor, one who always> displayed outstanding psychological insight and knowledge that was certainly> beyond our own conscious abilities.> > “Seth” went on to dictate a number of books, with titles like The Seth Materialand Seth Speaks, which achieved tremendous popularity. They certainlydemonstrate that Seth, whether an aspect of Jane Roberts’s unconscious mind or agenuine “spirit”, was of a high level of intelligence. Yet when Jane Robertsproduced a book that purported to be the after-death journal of the philosopherWilliam James, it was difficult to take it seriously. James’s works are notedfor their vigour and clarity of style; Jane Roberts’s “communicator” writes likean undergraduate:> Yet, what a rambunctious nationalistic romp, and it was matched with almost> missionary fervour by the psychologists, out to root from man’s soul all of> those inconsistencies and passions that were buried there; and to leash these> as well for the splendid pursuits of progress, industry and the physical> manipulation of nature for man’s use.> > There is a clumsiness here that is quite unlike James’s swift-moving, colloquialprose. “And to leash these as well . . .” is simply not William James; he wouldsimply have said “And to harness these . . .”Yet Seth himself often says things of immense and profound importance – forexample, his emphasis (in The Nature of Personal Reality) on the importance ofthe conscious mind and conscious decision.> I quite realise that many of my statements will contradict the beliefs of> those of you who accept the idea that the conscious mind is relatively> powerless, and that the answers to problems lie hidden beneath – i.e., in the> “unconscious”. Obviously the conscious mind is a phenomenon, not a thing. It> is ever-changing. It can be concentrated or turned by the ego in literally> endless directions. It can view outward reality or turn inward, observing its> own contents . . . It is far more flexible than you give it credit for.> > Comments like these are so opposed to our familiar dogmas about the unconsciousand the “solar plexus” that they make an impact of startling freshness. This isnot the usual diffuse verbiage of “inspirational” writing, but the communicationof a vision into the powers of the mind. If Seth is an aspect of Jane Roberts,then she is a philosopher of considerable insight.The experience of the Londoner Tony Neate is typical of the “psychic” who findshimself “in communication” with Van Dusen’s “higher order hallucinations”. In1950, at the age of twenty, he began as a skeptic playing with a primitive formof ouija board, a glass on a polished table-top; the glass flew off the tablewith such violence that it knocked a man over backward. He began to practisepsychometry – receiving “pictures” from objects that are held in the hand – andfound that his visions of the history of such objects were often accurate. Oneday when he was practising psychometry he went into a trance, and “spirits”spoke through him. A “spirit” who claimed to be Freud quoted a German bookgiving the exact page; Tony Neate was able to track down the book in the LondonLibrary and found the quotation accurate. A spirit who claimed to be the singerMelba told of a concert she had given in Brussels; again, the statement wasfound to be accurate.Then, during the Christmas of 1955, Tony Neate found himself tuned in to acharacter who called himself Helio-Arcanophus (H-A for short), who claimed to bean inhabitant of Atlantis – the name means high priest of the sun. Tony Neateand his associates founded a society called the Atlanteans, and they moved intoa farm complex in West Malvern. The writer Annie Wilson spent some time there,and her book about her experiences, Where There’s Love, makes it clear that,like Seth, “H-A” has many important and some original things to say. Readingthese utterances, it is natural for the skeptic to assume that they originate inthe unconscious mind of Tony Neate. But if that is the case, then how can weexplain the Freud quotation and the information obtained from “Melba”? And if weare willing to admit that this information was obtained “paranormally” or thatany information can be obtained paranormally, as in the case of the Glastonburyscripts (see Time in Disarray) then it is obviously possible that the sameapplies to the utterances of Seth and Helio-Arcanophus.Not all “occult teachings” claim to originate with disembodied entities; othersare accompanied by the claim that they have been preserved down the ages bysecret societies or brotherhoods. George Gurdjieff, one of the most originalthinkers of the twentieth century, spent much of his youth in search of acertain “Sarmoung Brotherhood”, and claimed to have received his basic teachingsfrom a monastic brotherhood in the northern Himalayas. The essence ofGurdjieff’s teaching consists in the notion that ordinary consciousness is aform of “sleep”, that nearly all human activities are entirely “mechanical”, andthat if man wishes to cease to be mechanical he has to make a tremendous effortof will. But books like In Search of the Miraculous (by Gurdjieff’s leadingfollower P.D. Ouspensky) make it clear that behind Gurdjieff’s “psychological”teachings lay a highly complex cosmological system, which has no obviousrelevance to the psychological teachings, and which it seems unlikely thatGurdjieff invented himself.This cosmology is further elabourated in the four-volume work of another leadingGurdjieff follower, J.G. Bennett, The Dramatic Universe, which is founded on theassertion that “there is a class of cosmic essences called Demiurges that isresponsible for maintaining the universal order”, and that these DemiurgicIntelligences “work upon time scales far exceeding the span of a human life”.Bennett calls the universe “dramatic” to underline his sense of the importanceof free will; because the universe is not dead and predetermined, the finaloutcome is uncertain. “The key to the whole scheme is will-time or Hyparxis.This is the region in which the will is free to make decisions that introducesomething new and uncaused into the world process”. The demiurges have fargreater power than man to introduce something new and uncaused into the worldprocess; but they are not infallible. Although their main task is “to guide theevolution of the world from its first lifeless beginning”, they have “guided theprocess by experiment and trial, sometimes making mistakes and retracing theirsteps, sometimes making great leaps forward, as when life came out of the oceanand land creatures began”. Bennett adds that Gurdjieff calls the demiurges“angels”, “but this had so many meanings that it is best avoided”.The existence of a secret tradition of hidden teachings is hinted at in IdriesShah’s book The Sufis, and it was in a review of this book in the London EveningNews that its literary editor, Edward Campbell, wrote:> For many centuries there has been a strange legend in the East. It suggests> that in some hidden centre, perhaps in the Highlands of Central Asia, there> exists a colony of men possessing exceptional powers. This centre acts, in> some respects at least, as the secret government of the world.> > Some aspects of this legend came to the West during the Crusades; the idea was> renewed in Rosicrucian guise in 1614; it was restated with variations last> century by Mme Blavatsky and the French diplomat Jacoliot; was suggested again> by the English author Talbot Mundy, and most recently by the Mongolian> traveller Ossendowski in 1918.> > In the mysterious Shangri-la of this legend, certain men, evolved beyond the> ordinary human situation, act as the regents of powers beyond this planet.> > Through lower echelons – who mingle unsuspected in ordinary walks of life,> both East and West – they act at critical stages of history, contriving> results necessary to keep the whole evolution of the earth in step with events> in the solar system.> > And in his book The People of the Secret (1983), Campbell (under the punningpseudonym Ernest Scott) goes on to suggest that “in the first quarter of the20th century, Western science had not only reached a critical stage but animpasse and that, simultaneously, material possibly capable of resolving thatsituation appeared unobtrusively from the East”. He goes on to suggest that“this interpretation derives from a source superior to, and qualitativelydifferent from, ordinary intellect”, and that “similar ‘intervention’ occurs atcritical points in human history and has done so in all cultures and all ages ina form appropriate to the moment”. Campbell refers to the sources of thisinfluence as “the Tradition”, and suggests that between 1920 and 1950 part ofthe intention appears to have been to “reveal publicly the mechanism of theTradition’s own operation”. And he mentions that two men who were in contactwith “the Tradition” were J.G. Bennett and Rodney Collin, both followers ofGurdjieff.Campbell goes on to suggest a close analogy between the human organism and acivilized culture.> A sperm cell originates a new individual. Suppose a conscious man originates a> new culture. Suppose that within life there are a few men, unsuspected and> hidden, who are able to process conscious energy and are therefore in touch> with the pattern of conscious energy outside life. (In J.G. Bennett’s> terminology this would correspond to the Demiurgic level.) Such conscious men> would be to a human culture as a sperm cell is to tissue cells in the human> body.> > Campbell then sketches out the “cultural systems” outlined by Rodney Collin inhis book The Theory of Celestial Influence (Chapter XVI): Aurignacian man,Magdalenian man, Middle and Far Eastern Man (Egypt, Sumer, Ancient India),Graeco-Roman Man, Early Christian Man, Mediaeval Christian Man, Renaissance Man,Modern Man. In this scheme Egypt gave birth to the world of the Greeks, and theGreeks transmitted the “energy of fertilization” to Rome via the philosophy ofthe Stoics and Epicureans. “Again a period of dazzling achievement seeminglyfrom nowhere”. Early Christianity sprang out of Rome, but by the eighth centuryhad fossilized into the corrupt church of the mediaeval papacy. The nextculture, according to Campbell, is the medieval church, which originated inCluny, whose Gothic cathedral “encapsulated all the Gothic cathedrals to come”.“In each of these there was a suggestion of a whole unseen cosmology; each anencyclopedia in stone containing, for those who could read . . . a summary ofthe Plan and Purpose of evolution”. Campbell clearly agrees with the author ofThe Mystery of the Cathedrals (see chapter 17) that Gothic cathedrals werealchemical textbooks. The medieval masons were exponents of “the Tradition”.Campbell also notes that this was also the period of “esoteric building inIslam”, and mentions the joint mission from Cluny and Chartres to Saracen Spain,which returned with knowledge of logarithms, algebra and alchemy.This was the preparation for the next major stage: the Renaissance. AndRenaissance culture finally gave way to the modern epoch around themid-nineteenth century – Campbell mentions 1859, the year of The Origin ofSpecies. Our modern age, Campbell suggests, reached the peak of its developmentabout 1935 with road and air transport and radio and cinema – and indeed, we cansee that these developments transformed the mental outlook of the human racejust as the invention of printing did in the Renaissance. The modern epoch maywell continue for another six or seven hundred years; but the new epoch thatwill replace it will struggle into being long before our own period comes to anend.Campbell’s starting point, then, is the “Demiurgic intelligences” of J.G.Bennett. He assumes that these are a reality, and that their activities can beseen in human history. From the point of view of this “Hidden Directorate”,early Christianity took the wrong turning. He sees the mission of Jesus as anevent of universal significance, an attempt to introduce certain energies intothe evolutionary process – the energies of a selfless love. Campbell suggeststhat the Early Fathers “rejected the wisdom component within which lay thetechniques of developing consciousness”. They reasoned that nothing is necessaryfor spiritual evolution except the Christ. The “heretic” Arius feltinstinctively that this was a mistake. His heresy consisted of the assertionthat the Son was not the equal of the Father – a dim recognition that Jesus hadbeen “sent” into history at a particular time for a particular purpose. When theCouncil of Nicaea rejected this view in AD 325, they turned their back on the“Demiurgic Tradition”. “Yet”, says Campbell,> Demiurgic responsibility for evolution remained. The Demiurges were still> obligated to achieve evolutionary gains, in harmony with growth beyond the> earth. Their agents, the Hidden Directorate on earth, were still required to> contrive the social environment which would provide the necessary> opportunities. The mandate of both is to raise the level of consciousness of> mankind in general and of suitable individuals exceptionally. Mankind in the> West had subconsciously decided that this was no longer necessary.> > The coming of Mohammed once again allowed the Demiurges a foothold. A “school”for the oral transmission of his ideas formed around him. “This inner group of90 took an oath of fidelity and are said to have adopted the name Sufi”. (Amoment later, Campbell confuses the issue by stating that this is not to saythat Sufism derives from Mohammedanism, and that the Sufic tradition actuallygoes back through Plato, Hippocrates, Pythagoras and Hermes Trismegistos. Butthe main thrust of his argument is clear.) In due course the Arabs invadedSpain, and planted the seeds that would become the Renaissance.Campbell’s chapter on “Rome, Christianity and Islam” contains a clear example ofwhat he means by Demiurgic intervention in human history. The monasteries ofwestern Europe, which preserved learning during the Dark Ages, were too remoteand inaccessible to serve as real cultural centres. But St Patrick’s conversionof Ireland – beginning in AD 432 – caused “the rebirth of Celtic culture by a‘shock’ from Christianity”. Ireland became a centre of learning – so much sothat in 550 a ship had to be chartered to carry scholars from Gaul to Cork.Celtic Christianity valued pagan literature. St Columba and his pupil Columbanusdirected the missionary flow back to Europe, and Columbanus founded more than ahundred monasteries. Rome finally brought the Celtic Church to heel in 664 atthe Synod of Whitby, but the impulse could not be destroyed. Two Celtic monkswere established as dispensers of wisdom at the court of Charlemagne. Campbellmakes the fascinating suggestion that the Celtic Church obtained some of itswisdom through “psychokinetic techniques”. Psychokinesis is the term invented bystudents of parapsychology for “mind over matter”, and Campbell suggestselsewhere in the book that this is the basic secret of alchemy; it is not quiteclear how he believes the Celtic Church used these techniques.In the ninth century, says Campbell, schools of initiates began to flourish inCórdoba and Toledo, and their efforts were to have far-reaching influences,which can still be traced in the world today. The doctor Al Razi and the scholarAvicenna, both Persians, were only two of an immense number of scholars who“provided the raw material for the coming injection of intellect into Europe”.Among these intellectual impulses were the schools of thought that would laterbecome known as Freemasonry and Illuminism, “impulses which at their seventhharmonic were to encompass the French Revolution”.The next five chapter of The People of the Secret are an interpretation ofEuropean history from the “interventionist” point of view. They consider theKabbalah, the Tarot and alchemy as vehicles of “the Tradition”, and study thehistorical significance of Catharism, the rise of the Troubadors, and thelegends of King Arthur. Again and again, Campbell traces the original seed ofthese movements back to their Sufic origins.In the chapter on Gurdjieff, Campbell comments:> Since the early 1950s, a great deal of hitherto unknown material has become> available, and in the nature of things this cannot have happened by accident.> If it has leaked, it is because those in charge of it have decided to “leak”> it.> > Separately, the various hints amount to little. Taken together, they suggest> for the first time the nature of the organisation, long suspected but never> identified, which is concerned with injecting developmental possibilities into> the historical process at certain critical points.> > On the basis of internal evidence, it may be legitimate to suggest that this> organisation is the expression of one of the Centres inferred by J.G. Bennett> as directing the evolution of the whole human race. In The Dramatic Universe,> the Centres of Transformation are the four hypothetical regions where, 35,000> to 40,000 years ago, the human mind was endowed with creativity and man became> Homo sapiens sapiens. Twelve thousand years ago, these Centres withdrew for> some 80 generations to prepare for the debut of modern man. The suggestion is> that one of these, immediately responsible for the West, has decided to come,> partially at least, into the open in the second half of the 20th century. It> may be that the intellectual development of the West is now at such a stage> that the parent can only guide the offspring further by taking it into its> confidence.> > Campbell mentions that attempts by Gurdjieff’s pupils to make contact with themonasteries or other teaching centres where Gurdjieff gained his “occult”knowledge were all unsuccessful.> In the 1930s it is believed that Ouspensky made contact with the Mevlevi> (Order of Dervishes) and asked them to send someone to England. This they> declined to do, but indicated that they were prepared to receive a> representative from him. One of Ouspensky’s senior pupils was ready to leave> for the East in 1939 when War broke out and the project was abandoned.> > But in 1961 a journalist seeking material for an article on Sufi practices “wasunaccountably introduced to every facility for getting material . . . Thisjournalist, Omar Burke, found himself allowed to visit a secret Dervishcommunity whose location has been identified as Kunji Zagh (“Raven’s Corner’) inBaluchistan”. Burke then wrote up his findings in an article in Blackwood’sMagazine in December 1961. It was seen by a member of a London Gurdjieff groupwho realized that one trail to Gurdjieff’s source was being openly revealed in amagazine. But when the London group made contact with the “source” they weretold that it would be pointless to come to Baluchistan because the current focusof activity was in England.Campbell argues that Gurdjieff’s “source” was the Sufic tradition. What isimplied, presumably, by the comment about the “current focus” in London is thatthis is to be found in the group run by Idries Shah, author of the book TheSufis. Bennett had in fact handed over his own teaching centre at Coombe Springsto Shah. In his autobiography Witness Bennett describes how in 1962 he was toldby an old friend about Idries Shah, who had come to England from Afghanistan toseek out followers of Gurdjieff and “complete their teaching”. At a meeting withShah his first impressions were unfavourable.> He was restless, smoked incessantly, talked too much, and seemed too intent on> making a good impression. Halfway through the evening our attitude completely> changed. We recognised that he was not only an unusually gifted man, but that> he had the indefinable something that marks the man who has seriously worked> upon himself.> > Shah, he says, did not claim to be a teacher, but he claimed to have been sentby his own teacher, and that “he had the support of the ‘Guardians of theTradition’”. He goes on to quote a document Shah gave him, “Declaration of thePeople of the Tradition”, which stated that a “secret, special, superior form ofknowledge” really exists, and could be transmitted> to the people to whom this material is addressed . . . This knowledge is> concentrated, administered and presided over by three forms of individual . .> . They have been called an “Invisible Hierarchy” because normally they are not> in communication or contact with ordinary human beings: certainly not in> two-way communication with them.> > Bennett then goes on to tell how he was persuaded by Shah to hand over CoombeSprings, with no strings attached, and a note of bitterness creeps in when hedescribes how Shah sold the house for £100,000 only a year later. Yet it remainsclear that in spite of a certain personal animosity towards Shah, Bennett stilldoes not discount the possibility that he is precisely what he says he is.In any case, Campbell’s thesis does not stand or fall by whether the reader iswilling to accept Idries Shah as a representative of “the secret people”. It wasBennett himself who invented the phrase “the Hidden Directorate” in The DramaticUniverse. Campbell summarizes the thesis of his book:> The script for the long human story was written by intelligences much greater> than man’s own . . . Responsibility for this process on Earth lies with an> Intelligence which has been called The Hidden Directorate. This may correspond> to the level symbolised in occult legend as an Individual (eg “The Regent” or> “The Ancient of Days”, etc). It is to be equated either with the Demiurgic> level or with the level immediately below.> > Side by side with action on humanity-in-the-mass, the Executive and its> subordinates are concerned with local attempts to raise the conscious level of> individual men exceptionally.> > Such specially selected ordinary individuals may aspire to qualify for> participation in the work of the Executive. The process by which they may so> qualify is the Magnum Opus – the “Great Work”. This is equivalent to a> vertical ascent to a higher level as opposed to a gradual rise with the> evolutionary tide.> > In 1857 an American schoolmistress and authoress, Delia Bacon, produced hercontroversial work Philosophy of the Plays of Shakespeare Unfolded (see chapter51) in which she suggested that “Shakespeare” was actually a group ofElizabethan scholars, probably led by Francis Bacon, whose aim was to expressnew ideas that would otherwise have led to torture and imprisonment. The bookwas received with derision, and Delia Bacon went insane and died soon after.Campbell expresses the same theory at two points in The People of the Secret,and skeptics will undoubtedly feel that his whole thesis deserves the samereception as Delia Bacon’s. The commonsense objection is that men whorepresented turning-points in human history – Mohammed, Cosimo de’ Medici,Darwin, Einstein – were obviously not members of some “Hidden Directorate”. Andif no “hidden directorate” is needed to explain their existence or their impacton history, then why bother to entertain such an unnecessary hypothesis?On the other hand, cultural historians have often observed how certain ideasseem to be “in the air” at certain times, and the Germans coined a word toexpress this phenomenon, the Zeitgeist. Every major discovery and inventionseems to have been made by at least two people at the same time (evolution,photography, relativity, sound-recording, television). The biologist RupertSheldrake has even produced a theory (“morphic resonance”) arguing that once anydifficult process has been achieved, from crystallization of a new substance tothe creation of a new idea, it “spreads” like a wave on the surface of a pond,facilitating the process wherever it occurs. Again, Jung’s idea of synchronicity(see chapter 54) suggests some connection between the mind and the world ofphysical matter which finds no support in the western philosophy of science.Such ideas indicate a movement away from the “dead” universe ofnineteenth-century science and towards the ”intelligent universe” posited by DrDavid Foster. It could be argued that a “hidden directorate”, responsible forevolution, is only a logical extension of this idea.Campbell mentions Yeats’s book A Vision as an example of a work inspired by “theTradition”. This work is a “system” of human types, expressed in terms of thephases of the moon, and was produced by Yeats’s wife Georgie through automaticwriting. Yeats’s “communicators” also sketched out their own vision of history,which has much in common with that advanced in People of the Secret. But whenYeats offered to “spend what remained of life explaining and piecing together”this complex system, he received the reply: “No, we have come to give youmetaphors for poetry”. Even if the “Hidden Directorate” is accepted only on thislevel, it remains a fascinating and fruitful hypothesis."},{"pageContent":"41 PoltergeistsThe poltergeist or “noisy ghost” is one of the most baffling phenomena in thewhole realm of the paranormal. There are thousands of people who do not believein ghosts, but who will reluctantly admit that the evidence for the poltergeistis too strong to ignore. The favourite theory of such skeptics is that thepoltergeist is some unexplained freak of the human mind.If the poltergeist is a “ghost” or spirit, as its name implies, then its chiefcharacteristic is as a spirit of mischief. Poltergeists cause objects to flythrough the air, doors to open and close, pools of water to appear from nowhere.And they are by no means a rarity; at this very moment some case of poltergeistactivity is probably going on within a dozen miles of the reader of this book.(I know of a case that is going on within a dozen miles of me as I write this.)One of the earliest known cases was recorded in a chronicle called the AnnalesFuldenses and dates back to AD 858. It took place in a farmhouse at Bingen, onthe Rhine; the chronicle describes an “evil spirit” that threw stones, and madethe walls shake as if men were striking them with hammers. Stone-throwing is oneof the most typical of poltergeist activities. The poltergeist also caused fires– another of their favourite activities (although, for some reason, they seldomdo serious damage) – in this case burning the farmer’s crops soon after theywere gathered in. It also developed a voice – a much rarer feature inpoltergeist cases – and denounced the man for various sins, includingfornication and adultery. Priests sent by the Bishop of Mainz apparently failedto exorcise it; in fact, it is virtually impossible to get rid of a poltergeistby exorcism ceremonies.It was only after the formation of the Society for Psychical Research in 1882that the poltergeist was carefully studied. Then it was observed that in themajority of cases there were adolescent children present in the houses wheresuch occurrences took place; it seemed a reasonable assumption that the childrenwere somehow the “cause” of the outbreak. And in the age of Freud the mostwidely held theory was that the poltergeist is some kind of “unconscious”manifestation of adolescent sexual energies; but no one has so far offered atheory as to exactly how this can occur.In England one of the most spectacular cases is also one of the earliest to bethoroughly recorded: the so-called “phantom drummer of Tedworth”. It took placein the home of a magistrate called John Mompesson in March 1661. The wholehousehold was kept awake all night by loud drumming noises. The magistrate hadbeen responsible for the arrest of a vagrant named William Drury, who attractedattention in the street by beating a drum. Mompesson had the drum confiscated,in spite of Drury’s appeals. Drury escaped from custody – he was being held forpossessing forged papers – without his drum. It was after this that thedisturbances in Mompesson’s household began, and continued for two years. The“spirit” also slammed doors, made panting noises like a dog, and scratchingnoises like huge rats, as well as purring noises like a cat. It also developed avoice and shouted, “A witch, a witch”! It emptied ashes and chamberpots into thechildren’s beds, and caused various objects to fly through the air. In 1663Drury, who was in prison for stealing a pig, admitted to a visitor that he wassomehow responsible for the disturbances, and said they would continue untilMompesson gave him satisfaction for taking away his drum. But the phenomenafinally seem to have faded away.A famous poltergeist haunting took place in the home of the Rev. Samuel Wesley –grandfather of the founder of Methodism – at his rectory at Epworth inLincolnshire. “Old Jeffrey”, as the family came to call it, kept the familyawake on the night of 1 December 1716 with appalling groans, and – a few nightslater – with loud knocking noises. It also produced sounds of footsteps walkingalong the corridors and in empty rooms. The “focus” of the disturbances seemedto be nineteen-year-old Hetty Wesley, who was usually asleep when thedisturbances began, and who trembled in her sleep. As usual, the disturbancesgradually faded away.The famous case of the “Cock Lane” ghost ended with an innocent man going toprison for two years. The “focus” of the disturbances was ten-year-old ElizabethParsons, daughter of a clerk called Richard Parsons. The Parsons family had twolodgers: a retired innkeeper named William Kent and his common-law wife FannyLynes, whose sister Elizabeth had been Kent’s previous wife. (This was why theycould not marry, the law preventing a man from marrying his deceased wife’ssister.) One night when Kent was away Fanny Lynes asked the ten-year-old girl tosleep with her to keep her company; they were kept awake by scratching andrapping noises from behind the wainscot. Soon after this Fanny Lynes died ofsmallpox, and Kent moved elsewhere. The strange rappings continued, and aclergyman named Moore tried to communicate with the “spirit”, using a code ofone rap for yes, two for no. By this means the “spirit” identified itself asFanny Lynes, and accused her ex-“husband” of poisoning her with arsenic.Parsons was unfortunately unaware that poltergeists tell lies more often thannot. And he was not displeased to hear that Kent was a murderer, for he wasnursing a grudge against him. Kent had lent him money which he had failed torepay, and was now suing him. So Parsons overlooked the fact that the knockingsbegan before the death of Fanny Lynes, and made no attempt to keep therevelations secret.In due course, Kent heard that he was being accused of murder by a “spirit”, andcame to the house in Cock Lane, to hear for himself. When the raps accused himof murder he shouted angrily, “Thou art a lying spirit”.The “ghost” became famous. But when a committee – including Dr Johnson – came toinvestigate, it preferred to remain silent, convincing Johnson that it was afraud. Then Kent decided to prosecute for libel. The burden of proof lay onElizabeth’s father who was for legal purposes the accuser. There was anothertest, and Elizabeth was told that if the ghost did not manifest itself thistime, her mother and father would be thrown into prison; naturally, she madesure something happened. But servants peering through a crack saw that she wasmaking the raps with a wooden board. She was denounced as a fake. At the trialParsons was sentenced to two years in prison, as well as to stand three times inthe pillory. His wife received a year; a woman who had often “communicated” withthe spirit received six months. Even the parson was fined £588 – a huge sum forthose days. But when Parsons was standing in the pillory the crowd wasdistinctly sympathetic and took up a collection for him – an unusual gesture inthat age of cruelty, when crowds enjoyed pelting the malefactor in the pillory,sometimes even killing him. Regrettably, we know nothing of what happened to anyof the protagonists after the trial. But it is very clear that the unfortunateParsons family suffered a great injustice. Many witnesses testified earlier thatit would have been impossible for Elizabeth to have faked the rapping noises.One of America’s most famous cases occurred on the farm of a Tennessee farmernamed John Bell; the case of the “Bell witch” is also unusual – in fact,virtually unique – in that the poltergeist ended by causing the death of itsvictim, Bell himself. Bell had nine children, one of whom, Betsy, was a girl oftwelve; she was almost certainly the “focus”. The disturbances began in 1817with scratching noises from the walls, and occasional knocks. Then invisiblehands pulled bedclothes off the beds, and there were choking noises that seemedto come from a human throat. Then stones were thrown and furniture moved. The“spirit” frequently slapped Betsy, and her cheek would redden after the soundsof the blow; it also pulled her hair. After about a year the poltergeistdeveloped a voice – a strange asthmatic croak. (Poltergeist voices seldom soundlike human voices – it is as if the “entity” is having to master an unfamiliarmedium). It made remarks like “I can’t stand the smell of a nigger”. After itsmanifestations Betsy was usually exhausted – she was obviously the source of itsenergy.Then John Bell began to be attacked; his jaw became stiff and his tongueswelled. The poltergeist, which had now developed a normal voice, identifieditself as an Indian, then as a witch called Old Kate Batts. (It used severalvoices.) It also declared that it would torment John Bell until he died, whichit then proceeded to do. It pulled off his shoes, hit him in the face, andcaused him to have violent physical convulsions. All this continued until oneday in 1820 he was found in a deep stupor. The “witch” claimed that she hadgiven “old Jack” a dose of a medicine that would kill him. And when Bell did infact die the witch filled the house with shrieks of triumph. Then thedisturbances abated. One day in 1821, as the family was eating supper, there wasa loud noise in the chimney, and an object like a cannonball rolled out from thefireplace and turned into smoke. The witch’s voice cried: “I am going and willbe gone for seven years”. But she stayed away for good.One expert on poltergeists, Nandor Fodor, has suggested that the explanation ofthe Bell witch lies in an incestuous attack made on Betsy by her father, andthat the poltergeist is a “personality fragment” that has somehow broken free ofthe rest of the personality. There is no real evidence for either of theseclaims.Another famous American case took place in the home of the Rev. Eliakim Phelpsin 1850. This poltergeist began by scattering furniture around and makingcurious dummies out of stuffed clothes. They were extremely lifelike and wereconstructed in a few minutes. Then the poltergeist entered the stone-throwingstage (most disturbances seem to go through a number of definite phases),breaking seventy-one windowpanes. Paper burst into flames and all kinds ofobjects were smashed. The twelve-year-old boy, Harry, was snatched up into theair, and on one occasion tied to a tree. His elder sister Anna, sixteen, waspinched and slapped. But when mother and children went off to Pennsylvania forthe winter the disturbances ceased.It was in fact a series of poltergeist disturbances that started theextraordinary nineteenth-century craze known as Spiritualism, which began withtypical knocking noises in the home of the Fox family in Hydesville, New YorkState, in 1848; two daughters – Margaret, fifteen, and Kate, twelve – wereobviously the “focuses”. A neighbour who questioned the “spirit” (with the usualcode one knock for yes, two for no) was told that it was a peddler who had beenmurdered in the house. (Many years later, human bones and a peddler’s box werefound buried in the cellar.) The notoriety of the case caused many otherAmericans to take up “spiritualism”, sitting around a table in the dark withclasped hands, and asking for spirits to “manifest” themselves. The Hydesville“spirit” finally delivered a message announcing a new era in spiritcommunication. And in fact spiritualism swept across the United States, thenacross Europe.In the early 1850s a French educator named Léon-Denizard-Hyppolyte Rivail becameinterested in the new spiritualist craze; when two daughters of a friend provedto be proficient in “automatic writing” Rivail asked the “spirits” all kinds ofquestions, and received unusually constructive and serious answers. In duecourse these were published in The Spirits’ Book, which Rivail published underthe pseudonym of Allan Kardec. It became for a while a kind of Bible ofSpiritualism, although there was later a split within the movement, manyinfluential Spiritualists rejecting Kardec’s belief in reincarnation.In Paris in 1860 there had been a series of violent disturbances in a house inthe Rue des Noyers – the usual window-smashing and furniture-throwing. Rivailrequested to speak to the “spirit” responsible, and an entity that claimed to bea long-dead rag and bone man declared that it had used the “electrical energy”of a servant girl in the house to cause the disturbances. The girl, it said, wasquite unaware of this – in fact, she was the most terrified of them all. He hadbeen doing these things merely to amuse himself.“Kardec” was convinced that poltergeists are “earth-bound spirits” – that is,dead people who for various reasons have been unable to advance beyond thepurely material plane.One of the most remarkable American cases of the nineteenth century was recordedin a book called The Great Amherst Mystery by Walter Hubbell, a stage magicianwho moved into the house of the Teed family in Amherst, Nova Scotia, in 1869 toinvestigate a poltergeist that concentrated its attention on aneighteen-year-old girl named Esther Cox. The disturbances had begun in theprevious year, when Esther’s boy-friend, Bob MacNeal, had tried to order herinto the woods at gunpoint, presumably to rape her; when interrupted he fled andnever returned. Soon after this Esther and her sister Jane were kept awake bymouse-like rustling noises, and a cardboard box leapt into the air. Two nightslater, Esther’s body seemed to swell like a balloon, but returned to normalafter a sound like a thunder-clap. Bedclothes were thrown around the room.Esther’s pillow inflated like a balloon. In front of many witnesses, writingappeared on the wall saying, “Esther, you are mine to kill”. Esther oftencomplained of an “electric feeling” running through her body. When thepoltergeist got into its stride small fires broke out, objects flew around theroom, furniture moved, and Esther turned into a kind of human magnet, to whichknives and other metal objects stuck firmly. Hubbell succeeded in communicatingwith the “spirits”, who were able to prove their authenticity by telling him thenumber inside his watch and the date of coins in his pockets. When a barn burneddown Esther was accused of arson and sentenced to four months in prison. Whenshe came out again the manifestations stopped.The Society for Psychical Research was founded in 1882 to investigate “psychicalphenomena” scientifically. One of its most influential members, Frank Podmore,author of a valuable two-volume history of Spiritualism, was firmly convincedthe poltergeists were usually fakes, caused by stone-throwing children, althoughhe was willing to admit that a well-known case at Durweston, on ViscountPortman’s estate, was probably genuine. Podmore later had a lengthycorrespondence with Andrew Lang, who found Podmore’s skepticism too wholesale;Lang is generally conceded to have won this controversy.In 1990 the famous criminologist Cesare Lombroso investigated a case ofpoltergeist haunting in a wine shop in Turin. As Lombroso stood in the winecellar bottles gently rose from the shelves and exploded on the floor. At firstLombroso suspected that the proprietor’s wife was the cause of the disturbances,but they continued while she was away. Lombroso’s suspicions then focused on athirteen-year-old waiter. When this boy was dismissed the haunting stopped.So it was fairly clear to the early investigators that poltergeist phenomenawere connected, more often than not, with some particular person, usually anadolescent. (The word poltergeist was seldom used in the early days of psychicalresearch, although it had been used to describe various cases by Mrs CatherineCrowe in her best-seller The Night Side of Nature in 1848.) But it was not untilthe late 1940s that the “unconscious mind” theory became popular. Nandor Fodorput forward his theory that poltergeists are “personality fragments” in TheJournal of Clinical Psychopathology in 1945. Frank Harvey’s play The Poltergeisthad a successful West End run in 1946; it was based on a case that had takenplace at Pitmilly House, Boarshill, near Fife, in which £50 worth of fire damagehad been caused – Harvey transferred it to a Dartmoor vicarage. His playpopularized the “unconscious mind” theory, which had first been put forwardabout 1930 by Dr Alfred Winterstein, in discussing the case of the Austrianmedium Frieda Weisl; the latter’s husband described how, when they were firstmarried, ornaments would fly off the mantelpiece when she had an orgasm. TheCountess Zoe Wassilko-Serecki had reached similar conclusions when she examineda young Rumanian girl named Eleanore Zugun, who was continually slapped andpunched by a poltergeist – bite-marks that appeared on her were often damp withsaliva. By the end of the 1940s the “unconscious mind” theory was generallyaccepted by those psychical investigators who were willing to believe that thepoltergeist was not a fraud. This theory was summarized by BBC investigatorBrian Branston in his book Beyond Belief (1976):> I believe that, on the evidence, we may claim as a working hypothesis that> poltergeist phenomena are produced unconsciously by an individual whose psyche> is disturbed, that the disturbed psyche reacts on the oldest part of the> brain, the brain stem, which by means unknown to science produced the commonly> recognisable poltergeist phenomena. And these phenomena are the overt cry for> help: as the poem says . . . “I was not . . . waving but drowning”.> > Yet Branston’s own theory has been contradicted by a case he has cited earlierin the chapter on poltergeists – one that took place at Northfleet in Kent.Branston records that “spooks so upset the various tenants that the housefinally became empty. Previous tenants named Maxted had young children, and theusual poltergeist phenomena had taken place – mouse-like scratching noises, thenthe bedclothes pulled off the bed, ornaments disappearing and reappearing, andso on. When Mrs Maxted saw the ghost of a six-year-old girl they decided to moveout. The next tenants had no children; they heard strange noises in thebedrooms, and smelt an unpleasant, rotting smell, but it was only after a yearthat they woke up to find one end of the bed rising up into the air, whilebeside the bed stood a pinkish-orange phantom, partly transparent, of a womanwith no head. They also moved out. But even when the house was empty the nextdoor tenants were able to hear thumping noises, and were alarmed when their ownbed began to vibrate. So here, it seems, is a case where the “poltergeist”remained in the house throughout two tenancies, and stayed on when the house wasempty.A similar case was investigated by the present writer.20[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2237877] It took placein the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, in the home of the Pritchard family.Furniture moved, ornaments flew around, green foam gushed out of the taps, thehouse was shaken by thunderous crashes. A “ghost” – apparently a monk dressed inblack – was also seen. But the “haunting” began when the eldest son, Phillip,reached the age of fifteen, and lasted a few days. When his younger sister Dianewas fourteen the disturbances began again, and were this time more violent.(Diane had been away on holiday during the first outbreak.) Practically everybreakable object in the house was smashed, Diane was thrown repeatedly out ofbed and attacked by moving furniture, and a crucifix flew off the wall and stuckto her back, making a red mark. Then, as before, the manifestations faded. Dianeherself was aware that the entity was somehow using her energy, and also feltintuitively that it meant her no real harm.Cases like these suggest that the poltergeist is not a manifestation of theunconscious mind of an unhappy teenager but – as Kardec stated – an actualentity or “spirit”, which remains associated with some place, but which can onlymanifest itself through the surplus energy of a human being – not necessarily ateenager.This was the conclusion reached by Guy Lyon Playfair, a paranormal-investigatorwho went to Rio de Janeiro in the early 1960s. Brazil, unlike England andFrance, remained faithful to Allan Kardec’s version of spiritualism, and his twoworks, The Spirits’ Book and The Medium’s Book, became the basic scriptures ofBrazil’s most influential religion, “spiritism”. He investigated a poltergeistfor the Brazilian Institute for Psycho-biophysical Research, and began to acceptthe Brazilian belief that poltergeists are spirits, and that they can becontrolled by witch doctors, who may send them to haunt someone they dislike.One young girl named Maria was continually attacked by a poltergeist which triedto suffocate her and set her clothes on fire. A medium relayed a message sayingthat Maria had been a witch in a previous existence, through whom many peoplehad suffered, and now she was paying for it. Maria committed suicide with poisonat thirteen. Playfair’s books. The Flying Cow and The Indefinite Boundarypresent highly convincing evidence that most poltergeist disturbances are due to“spirits”.In 1977 Playfair and his fellow SPR member Maurice Grosse went to investigate apoltergeist at Enfield in north London. The case is described in detail in aclassic book This House is Haunted. There were four children in the Harperfamily, aged respectively thirteen, eleven, ten and seven; it was a one-parentfamily, and there was considerable psychological tension. The disturbances beganwith vibrating beds and moving furniture. Playfair tried holding a chair inposition with wire; the wire was snapped. A medium who came to the house saidthat there were several entities, and that eleven-year-old Janet was the“focus”. Playfair and Grosse finally established communication with the entityby means of a code of raps; it stated that it had been a previous tenant of thehouse thirty years ago and was now dead. It began to write messages in pencil.Eventually it developed a strange, harsh voice, identifying itself as JoeWatson. On another occasion the entity called itself Bill Haylock, and claimedthat it had come from a nearby graveyard in Durant’s Park. One of its standardreplies to questions (such as “Do you know you are dead”?) was “Fuck off”. BillHaylock was later identified as a local resident, now deceased. Finally, in1978, a Dutch clairvoyant, Dono Gmelig-Meyling, spent some time in the house,and somehow put an end to the “haunting”. He reported going on an “astral trip”,and meeting a 24-year-old girl who was somehow involved in the case. MauriceGrosse’s daughter Janet, who was the right age, had been killed in a motor-cyclecrash in 1976. Playfair speculates that it was Janet who drew her father’sattention to the case, putting it into the head of a neighbour to ring the DailyMirror, and into the head of a Daily Mirror journalist to contact the Societyfor Psychical Research. (Kardec insisted that our minds are far more influencedby “spirits” than we realize.) But the energy required by the poltergeist orpoltergeists was undoubtedly supplied by the children, primarily by JanetHarper. (Playfair commented at one stage that half the contents of the localgraveyard seemed to be haunting the house.)The view that poltergeists are “spirits” who make use of some form of humanenergy remains highly unfashionable among psychical investigators, who preferthe more “scientific” theory of Fodor. Yet the case of the phantom drummer ofTedworth seems to support Playfair’s view that poltergeist phenomena can becaused by “witchcraft”; and witches have traditionally claimed to perform their“magic” through the use of spirits. One thing is certain: that Podmore’s viewthat poltergeists are usually due to deliberate fraud is untenable in the faceof the evidence. Skeptics point out that most “psychical phenomena” areintermittent, and that they are so much the exception that they may safely beignored. But there have been literally thousands of cases of poltergeistphenomena, and they continue to occur with a regularity that makes them easy torecord and investigate. No one who considers the phenomenon open-mindedly canfail to be convinced that the poltergeist is a reality that defies “purelyscientific” explanation."},{"pageContent":"42 Possession by the DeadMyth or Reality?In 1924 the National Psychological Institute in Los Angeles published a bookwith the arresting title Thirty Years Among the Dead, by Carl A. Wickland. Itwas not, as one might have supposed, the memoirs of a mortuary attendant but anaccount by a respectable doctor of medicine of his psychological research intoSpiritualism. Inevitably, it aroused a great deal of scorn among the medicalfraternity, one fortunate result being that first editions are still fairly easyto find in the “occult” sections of secondhand bookshops. Yet this is hardlyfair to a work that proves, on closer examination, to be a sober and factualaccount of Dr Wickland’s theory that a great deal of mental illness is caused by“spirit possession”.Wickland, born in Leiden (Sweden) in 1861, had emigrated to Chicago, where heearned his medical degree; he became a member of the National Association forthe Advancement of Science and a medical adviser to the Los Angeles branch ofthe National Psychological Institute. It seems likely that he decided to burnhis boats and publish his book because at age sixty-three he was on the verge ofretirement anyway, and ridicule would make no difference.Ridicule was inevitable. Twelve years before Wickland had been born, in 1849,the movement called Spiritualism had been launched in the Corinthian Hall inRochester, New York, and within a few years, the new “religion” had swept acrossthe Christian world.It had all started two years earlier in the small town of Hydesville, wherestrange banging and rapping noises had kept the Fox family awake all night. MrsFox asked the unseen knocker whether it was a spirit, and if so, to make tworaps; she was answered by two thunderous bangs. Later “communications” in a codeof raps seemed to establish that the knocker was the ghost of a peddler who hadbeen murdered by a previous tenant and buried in the basement. (The previoustenant denied it indignantly, but more than half a century later, human boneswere unearthed in the basement, behind a makeshift wall.) The raps and bangsturned into typical poltergeist phenomena, which followed the two teenagesisters, Kate and Margaretta, even when they were separated. In the Fox home,bloodcurdling groaning noises and sounds like a body being dragged across thefloor made James Fox’s hair turn white. Eventually, a “spirit” spelled out amessage to the effect that “this truth” must be proclaimed to the world, whichled to the launch of the Spiritualist movement in November 1849.Suddenly, hundreds of “mediums” discovered that they could communicate withspirits; some “physical mediums” could even cause them to “materialize”.Scientists were furious and denounced the movement as a revival of medievalsuperstition; even the foundation of the Society for Psychical Research inLondon in 1882 – by serious-minded scientists, philosophers, and statesmen –failed to provide Spiritualism with an air of respectability.So even as late as 1924 Wickland was inviting ridicule with a title like ThirtyYears Among the Dead. Yet the book’s opening chapters soon make it clear thathis interest sprang from medical curiosity and was that of a medical man ratherthan a “believer”.It all began, he explained, with a patient whom he calls Mrs Bl –, who began topractice automatic writing and who soon began to have fits of derangement inwhich she used vile language and claimed she was an actress; she had to becommitted to an asylum. Another woman, “an artist and lady of refinement”,became convinced that she was a damned soul and knelt in the mud to pray at thetop of her voice. Yet another woman, who owned a millinery shop, posed in herwindow in her nightclothes, declaring that she was Napoleon, and had to beremoved by the police.At this time (in the mid-1890s) it was generally believed that mental illnesscould be explained in purely physical terms; many a head physician in a mentalhome was appointed because he had a working knowledge of brain anatomy. Freudhimself was an early convert to this theory (known as organicism), hisprofessor, Dr Theodore Meynert, being one of its chief advocates. (Meynert laterturned his back on Freud when the latter returned from Paris espousing a new“psychological” explanation of neurosis based on the idea of the unconsciousmind.) In America, the favourite theory of mental illness was that it was due topoisons in the system resulting from such causes as infected tonsils or decayedteeth. But Wickland was intrigued by the case of a youth named Frank James who,after a fall from a motorcycle at the age of ten, changed from an affectionate,obedient boy to a juvenile delinquent who spent many terms in reformatories andjails. Declared hopelessly insane, James succeeded in escaping from the criminalasylum and during his recapture was hit on the head with a club. On awakening,he had once again reverted to his earlier personality – gentle and good-natured.This convinced Wickland of the inadequacy of the “toxemia” theory. And while hewas still a medical student, his marriage to a woman who proved to be anexcellent “medium” soon provided him with evidence of an alternative theory. Oneday Wickland was dissecting a leg in medical school, and on his return home, wasalarmed when his wife, Anna, seemed to be about to faint. He placed his hand onher shoulder and was startled when she drew herself up and said threateningly,“What do you mean by cutting me”? After a few questions it became clear that hewas speaking to the spirit of the owner of the leg he had been dissecting.Wickland guided Anna to a chair, and the spirit objected that he had no right totouch “him”. When Wickland replied that he was touching his wife, it retorted,“What are you talking about? I am no woman – I’m a man”. Eventually, Wicklandreasoned the spirit into recognizing that it was dead and that dissecting itsold body would do it no harm. When it asked for a chew of tobacco or a pipe,Wickland had to explain that his wife was a nonsmoker. (The next day he observedthat the teeth of the corpse were heavily stained with tobacco.) More detailedexplanation finally convinced the man that he was dead, and he left.This showed Wickland that a “ghost” may believe that it is still alive,particularly if death came unexpectedly. He also encountered a case that seemedto demonstrate that spirits did not need to manifest themselves through a“medium”. When he was alone one day, dissecting a female corpse, he thought heheard a distant voice shout, “Don’t murder me”! A newspaper on the floor made arustling noise, as if it was being crushed. Some days later, at a séance, aspirit who gave her name as Minnie Morgan claimed that it was she who hadshouted “Don’t murder me”! and crushed the newspaper. Minnie also had to beconvinced that she was no longer alive.At séances, entities who spoke through his wife later explained to Wickland thatsuch “homeless spirits” – those who are unaware that they are dead – areattracted by the warmth of the “human aura” – a kind of energy sphere that issupposed to surround the human body – and, under certain circumstances, mayattach themselves to the owner of the sphere as a kind of mental parasite. Ineffect, such spirits are in a state of sleep, in which dreams and reality areconfused, and, as in sleep, the dreamer is unaware that he is dreaming.In one case – of a female musician who had suffered a nervous breakdown – thewoman spoke in a “wild gibberish” of English and Spanish (a language of whichshe was ignorant). Eventually, Wickland succeeded in learning that she waspossessed by three spirits: a girl named Mary, and two rival lovers. One hadmurdered Mary, then the two men had killed each other in a fight; the threespirits were unaware that they were dead and had found themselves able to“possess” the musician, who was psychically weakened. (Wickland’s experience wasthat people who are insane or on the verge of a nervous breakdown are vulnerableto these psychic parasites.) Before the woman was finally cured, another spirit– that of a little girl who had been killed in the San Francisco earthquake –was “removed” from her (by a mild shock treatment involving static electricitygenerated by a Wimshurst machine, which Wickland found highly effective in“dislodging” these uninvited visitors).Wickland’s book contains so many cases in its 460-odd pages that it isimpossible to summarize. But one typical case will illustrate why he was soconvinced that he was dealing with real spirits and not with some strange formof hysteria on the part of his wife. In 1904, at a seance in Chicago, MrsWickland began to clutch her throat and cry out, “Take the rope away. I am inthe dark”! When the “spirit” had been soothed into speaking normally, shedeclared that she was a sixteen-year-old girl named Minnie Harmening, who hadcommitted suicide by hanging herself in a Chicago suburb called Palatine(Wickland misheard it as Palestine). She had, she said, encountered the spiritof a big man with a black beard in the barn, and he had “hypnotized” her andmade her hang herself.Wickland and his wife were on a visit to Chicago at that time and had not heardof what had become known as the Harmening suicide, which had taken place sixweeks earlier. The girl’s suicide had baffled her family because it had beenwithout apparent cause (although, Wickland adds, “the girl had always beenpeculiar”, implying that she was mentally deficient). Moreover, there were somesuspicious circumstances – the clothes around the neck had been torn, and therewere scratches on her throat. The suicide had taken place – as the girl had said– in Palatine, Cook County, Illinois.The spirit appeared again at the next séance and in reply to questions,explained that as soon as she had kicked the box away, she “came to her senses”and clawed at her clothes, tearing them as she tried to loosen the rope.Wickland cites many such cases in which he was able to corroborate the evidenceof “spirits”. But what is obviously of chief interest in this case is that thegirl claimed to have been “hypnotized” (she may simply mean strongly influenced)by a black-bearded spirit and induced to kill herself. That is to say, she had,in effect, been “possessed” by the black-bearded spirit.Unfortunately, Wickland was not generally concerned with the kind ofcorroboration he provides in this case, with the result that his book is seldommentioned by modern scientific investigators of the paranormal. (Wickland’s ownexcuse is that the spirits were usually in such a state of confusion that theycould not give precise names and dates.) What he might have done is illustratedby his friend F. Lee Howard, a congregational minister, who attended a sessionin which the Wicklands were attempting to treat the daughter of one of Howard’sfriends. Howard questioned a “possessing spirit”, which declared itself to bethat of a suicide victim, and he obtained the name and date. A check with thecoroner’s records confirmed that such a person had committed suicide on thegiven date. In another case, a reader of Wickland’s book wrote to say that thedetails given by one of the spirits convinced him that it was his father’scousin.Another objection raised by modern researchers is that Wickland is often naïveand that he is inclined to mistake mental illness for “spirit possession”. Forexample, the case of Frank James, the boy who became a juvenile delinquent aftera fall from a motorcycle, would nowadays be explained in terms of the science of“split-brain physiology”. This is based upon the recognition that when thecorpus callosum, the knot of nerves joining the two cerebral hemispheres of thebrain, is severed – as it is sometimes to cure epilepsy – the patient turns intotwo different people, each of whom resides in a separate hemisphere of thebrain. (See also chapter 25.) The normal “everyday self”, the person one thinksof as “me”, lives in the left hemisphere and is basically a logical andpractical person, the one who copes with daily chores. The person who lives inthe right is a stranger and seems to be altogether more intuitive andinstinctive; he seems more concerned with what goes on inside us. You could saythat the left-brain self is objective, the right brain subjective; one is, ineffect, a scientist and the other an artist. Most of us are unaware of this“other” (right-brain) self, even though we are connected to it by the corpuscallosum. In split-brain patients, the “other self” can be studied by directingstimuli to the left eye (actually, the left visual field) or the left side ofthe body; for some odd reason, the left side of the body is connected to theright brain, and vice versa.In a well-known case of the 1870s, a French youth named Louis Vivé was bitten bya viper and became paralyzed in both legs for three years; during this time hewas quiet and well behaved. One day he had a “hysterico-epileptic” attack,followed by a fifteen-hour sleep; when he woke up, the well-behaved youth hadgiven way to a violent, aggressive, and dishonest delinquent. But, unlike FrankJames, Vivé’s two personalities continued to alternate. This new “criminal” selfhad a speech defect and was paralyzed down the right side of his body. Afterreceiving a conviction for theft, Vivé was sent to an asylum at Rochefort, wheretwo doctors became interested in his case. At this time there was considerableinterest in the influence of magnets and of various metals on physical ailmentslike paralysis, and the doctors tried stroking his right side with steel. It hadthe effect of transferring the paralysis to the left side and restoring thepatient to his previous quiet and well-behaved personality. All his memories ofthe “criminal” period vanished, and he could recall only his “own” earlier self– although his “other self” could be brought back by hypnosis.Here it seems clear that the “criminal” Vivé was a condition associated with hisright brain – hence the speech disorder. (Speech is controlled by the left sideof the brain). Another well-known case of “dual personality”, that of ClaraFowler (described by Dr Morton Prince in his book Dissociation of a Personality– Prince calls her Christine Beauchamp) seems to illustrate the same point. Anold friend of Clara’s father made a sexual advance that so upset her that shebegan to suffer from depression and nervous exhaustion. When Prince placed herunder hypnosis, another personality emerged, a mischievous child who calledherself Sally. From then on, Sally would frequently “take over” the body andplay practical jokes, such as going for a long walk in the countryside, thenvacating the body and leaving Clara to walk home. Typically, Sally had a badstutter, suggesting that, like Vivé’s alter ego, she was associated with theright brain. (It has been noted that left-handed people who have been forced tolearn to write with the right hand often develop a stutter.)But while it is tempting to explain Wickland’s cases in terms of“multiple-personality disorder” and split-brain physiology, it proves inpractise to be an impossible enterprise; we can see that, in the case of theMinnie Harmening suicide, no amount of split-brain physiology can explain howMrs Wickland was able to describe a case of which she had no knowledge.In fact, Wickland’s findings had been anticipated by half a century. In 1855 aFrench educator named Léon Denizard Hyppolyte Rivail was introduced to asomnambule – a person who “channeled” trance communications when hypnotized –named Celina Bequet, through whom the spirit of the famous hypnotist FranzMesmer was alleged to speak. Accepting without question that he was in touchwith the spirits of the dead – a reasonable assumption under the circumstances –Rivail asked hundreds of questions about life after death and published theresult in an influential work entitled The Spirits’ Book. (He used the pseudonymAllan Kardec, suggested to him by “spirits”.)According to The Spirits’ Book, man consists of body, “aura”, intelligent soul,and spiritual soul. The aim of human life, according to the spirits, isevolution, and this comes about through reincarnation – rebirth into new bodies.People who die suddenly, or are unprepared for death by reason of wasted lives,are often unaware that they are dead and become homeless, wanderers on theearth, attracted by human beings of like mind, and sharing their lives andexperiences. They are able, to some extent, to influence these like-mindedpeople and to make them do their will through suggestion. Some “low spirits” areactivated by malice; others are merely mischievous and can use energy drawn fromhuman beings to cause physical disturbances – these are known as poltergeists.When Kardec asked, “Do spirits influence our thoughts and actions”? the answerwas, “Their influence upon [human beings] is greater than you suppose, for it isvery often they who direct both”. Asked about possession, the “spirit” explainedthat a spirit cannot actually take over another person’s body, since thatbelongs to its owner; but a spirit can assimilate itself to a person who has thesame defects and qualities as himself and may dominate such a person. In short,such spirits could be described as “mind parasites”.According to Wickland, one of the most famous murders of the early twentiethcentury was due to “spirit influence”. On the night of 25 June 1906, a wealthyyoung rake named Harry Thaw sat beside his wife on the roof of Madison SquareGarden, watching a new revue. Before her marriage, Mrs Thaw had been EvelynNesbit, a beautiful model and showgirl, whom Thaw had persuaded to accompany himto Europe. Thaw was addicted to flogging, and on one occasion, he whipped Evelynso severely that she was confined to bed for two weeks. When she admitted to himthat she had been seduced at the age of fifteen by Stanford White, the architectof Madison Square Garden, Thaw had become almost insane with jealousy. On thenight of 25 June, as they were leaving the roof show, Thaw saw White sittingalone at a table, walked up to him, and shot him three times with a pistol.At Thaw’s murder trial, Evelyn gave lurid details of her seduction by thearchitect (who was more than thirty years her senior), describing how he hadtaken her virginity after getting her drunk on champagne. (“When I came to Ifound myself in the bed, naked except for an abbreviated pink undergarment”.)21[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2238093] The jury wasunable to reach an agreement. At the second trial, Thaw was found not guilty byreason of insanity and confined to an asylum, from which he escaped in 1913;later that year a jury found him to be sane and authorized his release.Three weeks after the murder, on 15 July 1906, Mrs Wickland fell to the floorduring the course of a séance and when moved to a chair, shouted in a brusquevoice, “Waiter, bring me a drink”! Asked where she thought she was, she replied,“In Madison Square Roof Garden, of course”. Then she began to tremble,explaining that she could see “dead people”, and rushed about the room. As soonas this spirit ceased to “possess” Mrs Wickland, another spirit took over,exulting, “I killed the dog”! But this was not Harry Thaw; in reply to questionsthe spirit said that his name was Johnson and that he had caused Thaw to shootStanford White because “he had trifled too long with our daughters”. (In fact,White was a famous seducer of chorus girls, keeping a special apartment for thatpurpose; but then, Thaw shared his taste.) Next, a spirit who claimed to beThaw’s father appeared, begging the people present to “save my boy”. (Thawsenior had been dead for some years, and Thaw’s mother was overindulgent.) Hewent on to explain that Thaw had been obsessed by “vengeful spirits” when hekilled White and that his son was a “psychic sensitive”.There is nothing in the two books on the case, or in Evelyn Nesbit’s book, TheUntold Story, to suggest that Thaw may have been psychic. But Evelyn’s bookmakes it clear that Thaw was mentally little more than a child. One accountstates: “Had Thaw been a poor man, he probably would have been in an asylum”. Athis trial, evidence was presented of insanity in his family – in fact, his elderbrother, Horace, had died in an asylum. Evelyn Nesbit’s accounts of his violenttantrums – for example, if a waiter dared to try and brush crumbs off thetablecloth he would jerk the cloth away, hurling the dishes to the floor – makeit clear that he was mentally disturbed. (The tantrums would vanish with equalsuddenness, and Thaw’s face would dissolve into a charming and sunny smile.)While this does not support the case for “obsession” by vengeful spirits, itdoes support Wickland’s contention that Thaw was the type of person whose mindwas open to invasion because he was “not all there”.There is one small piece of evidence that suggests that the “spirit” of Thaw’sfather was what he claimed to be. He begged Wickland to “write to my wife and myattorney, Mr Olcott”, and in fact, Judge Olcott was Thaw’s attorney, a fact thatwas unknown to the Wicklands.The classic study of “possession”, Possession, Demoniacal and Other (1921), isby a Tübingen professor, T. K. Oesterreich. Oesterreich totally discounts the“spirit” explanation, insisting that possession is always a case of hysteria ormental illness. He will not even accept the hypothesis of multiple personality,since he cannot believe that the human personality can “split”. One of his mostimpressive pieces of evidence for the hysteria theory is a lengthy account ofthe famous case of “Achille”, described by the psychiatrist Pierre Janet.Achille, a moderately successful businessman, came from a peasant background andmarried early. In the winter of 1890, when he was thirty-three, Achille returnedfrom a business trip in a depressed condition, then suddenly went dumb. One dayhe sent for his wife and child, embraced them despairingly, then went into acataleptic state for two days. When he awoke he was suffering from delusions; heseemed to think he was in Hell and that demons were burning him and cutting himin pieces. The room, he said, was full of imps, and he was possessed by a devil.After a number of suicide attempts he was sent to the Salpêtrière Hospital inParis, under the care of the famous physician Charcot. The latter placed Janetin charge of the case.Janet watched with interest as Achille displayed all the signs of demoniacalpossession, as described in the Middle Ages: in a deep voice he cursed God, thenin a shrill voice protested that the Devil had forced him to do it.At first all of Janet’s efforts to communicate were a failure; Achille refusedto listen to him and resisted all of the doctor’s attempts to hypnotize him.Janet saw the solution when he observed that Achille was extremely absentminded– he compared him to someone searching for an umbrella that he holds in hishand. While Achille was raving, Janet quietly inserted a pencil in his hand,then tried ordering him, in a whisper, to make writing movements. The pencilwrote: “I won’t”. “Who are you”? asked Janet, and the pencil wrote: “The Devil”.“I shan’t believe you”, Janet replied, “unless you can give me proof. Can youmake Achille raise his left arm without knowing it”? “Of course”, came theanswer – and Achille raised his arm. “Why are you doing that”? Janet askedAchille in his normal voice, and Achille looked at his raised arm withastonishment.The demon went on to demonstrate his powers by making Achille dance, stick outhis tongue, and kiss a piece of paper. Finally, Janet asked him if he could putAchille into a deep sleep. Moments later, Achille was in a trance. Now Janet wasable to question him about the cause of his illness. He quickly learned thatAchille had been unfaithful to his wife while away on his business trip and thatdeep and intense guilt had caused the depression and other symptoms. Now that hewas able to induce hallucinations, Janet made Achille believe that his wife wasin the room and had forgiven him for his infidelity. (It is not quite clear fromJanet’s account whether the wife actually came to the hospital.) After this,Achille’s psychological problems soon cleared up.This is certainly a remarkable case. Yet as a refutation of the “spirit” theory,it is obviously open to one serious objection. According to Wickland, peoplesuffering from nervous traumas or states of intense guilt and misery are morelikely to become “obsessed” by spirits than normal healthy persons. Wicklandwould point out that Achille may have been genuinely “obsessed” by a mischievousspirit and that as soon as Janet had made him feel that he was forgiven, thespirit was “driven out”.In her introduction to Oesterreich’s Possession, Anita Gregory, an investigatorof the paranormal, has some harsh words to say about Wickland and his ThirtyYears Among the Dead. She points out that there is a basic sameness to all hiscases – he always has to convince a spirit that it is dead – and his account ofhow the spirits of Madame Blavatsky and Mary Baker Eddy expressed contrition fortheir false doctrines is almost laughable. She also points out thatOesterreich’s rationalism is often crude and unconvincing and that he deals withsubtleties by ignoring them.Perhaps the most obvious example of Oesterreich’s failure to allow facts tospeak for themselves is in his account of one of the most famous of all cases of“possession”, that of “the Watseka wonder”, a girl named Lurancy Vennum. In July1877 thirteen-year-old Lurancy, of Watseka, Illinois, had a fit, after which shebecame prone to trances. In these trances she became a medium, and a number ofdisagreeable personalities manifested themselves through her. On 11 February1878, placed under hypnosis by a local doctor, Lurancy stated that there was aspirit in the room named Mary Roff, and a Mrs Roff who was also presentexclaimed, “That’s my daughter”. Mary had died twelve years earlier, at the ageof eighteen. Lurancy then stated that Mary was going to be allowed to take overher body for the next three months.The next day Lurancy claimed to be Mary Roff. She asked to be taken back to theRoff’s home, and on the way there, she recognized their previous home, in whichthey had lived while she was alive and which was unknown to Lurancy. She alsorecognized Mary Roff’s sister, who was standing at the window. And during thenext few weeks, “Mary” showed a precise and detailed knowledge of the Roffhousehold and of Mary’s past, recognizing old acquaintances and toys andrecalling long-forgotten incidents. On 21 May, the day she had declared she hadto leave, she took a tearful farewell of her family, and on the way home,“became” Lurancy again. The case was investigated by Richard Hodgson, one of themost skeptical members of the Society for Psychical Research, who was convincedof its genuineness.Readers of Hodgson’s account of the “Watseka wonder” will find it very hard tofind loopholes; Mary provided such detailed proof of her knowledge of her earlyyears, and of the family background – recognizing unhesitatingly anyone Mary hadknown – that the notion of trickery or delusion becomes untenable; it is perhapsthe single most convincing case of “possession” in the history of psychicalresearch. But Oesterreich merely quotes William James’s summary of the case(from The Principles of Psychology), making no attempt to analyze it and passingon quickly to other matters – in spite of the fact that James himself had spokenof “the plausibility of the spiritualistic interpretation of the phenomenon”.And Anita Gregory concludes her introduction by admitting that she is unable todeclare that all the people in Oesterreich’s book are frauds, dupes, lunatics,and psychopaths, ending with the words: “So I shall conclude . . . that thephenomena described by Oesterreich are very much in need of an explanation”.Oesterreich’s pièce de résistance is a long account of the famous case of the“devils of Loudun”, which, in 1952, was made the subject of a full-length studyby Aldous Huxley. In 1633 Urbain Grandier, the parish priest of the small Frenchtown of Loudun, was charged with bewitching the nuns in a local convent andcausing them to be possessed by demons, so that they screamed blasphemies andobscenities and writhed about on the floor displaying their private parts.Grandier had become notorious for his immoralities – he had impregnated two ofhis penitents and seduced many others – and had made many enemies. Inquisitorsclaimed to find “devil’s marks” on his body, and in a trial that was a travestyof justice, he was found guilty and sentenced to be burned alive. Even undertorture, and later at the stake, Grandier maintained his innocence. His deathmade no difference, and the nuns continued to be possessed by “demons” for manyyears.Oesterreich, like Aldous Huxley, takes the view that all this could be explainedsimply in terms of hysteria, while another authority, Rossell Hope Robbins, goeseven further in his Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology and attributes themanifestations to outright imposture. But a careful reading of Huxley’s own bookmakes either of these explanations seem implausible. It is easy to see howsex-starved nuns could deceive themselves into believing that they werepossessed by devils – the Mother Superior of the convent, Sister Jeanne desAnges, admits in her autobiography that she made no real attempt to combat thepossession because she enjoyed the sexual stirrings aroused in her by thedemons.But it is far more difficult to understand what then happened to the exorciststhemselves. Brother Lactance, who had overseen the torture, became “possessed”and died insane within a month; five years later Brother Tranquille died ofexhaustion after months of battling against the “invaders” of his psyche, andwas amazed to witness his body writhing on the ground and hear himself utteringblasphemies that he was powerless to prevent. Brother Lucas, another ofGrandier’s persecutors, met the same fate. The “witch pricker”, Dr Mannouri,also died in delirium. Brother Jean-Joseph Surin, a genuinely saintly man, whowas called to Loudun to try and exorcise the nuns after Grandier’s execution,himself fell victim to the “devils” and became periodically insane fortwenty-five years.It is difficult to believe that ordinary hysteria could produce such results.Surin described in a letter how the “alien spirit” was united to his own,“constituting a second me, as though I had two souls”. Considering these facts,the skeptical Anita Gregory admits that “one is probably not justified inassuming that . . . the Loudun pandemonium [was] necessarily nothing butcollective delusion”. And bearing in mind Kardec’s comment that “a spirit doesnot enter into a body as you enter into a house . . . he assimilates himself toa [person] who has the same defects and the same qualities as himself”, thehypothesis that the Loudun “pandemonium” was caused by Wickland’s earthboundspirits seems, on the whole, more plausible than the religious-hysteria theory.It is difficult to draw a clear dividing line between “possession” andpoltergeist manifestations. Poltergeists are “noisy ghosts” who cause objects tofly through the air, and scientific observation of dozens of cases hasestablished their reality beyond all doubt. The most widely held current view isthat they are a form of ‘spontaneous psychokinesis” (mind over matter) caused bythe unconscious mind of an emotionally disturbed adolescent, but this theoryfails to explain how the unconscious mind can cause heavy objects to fly throughthe air. (In labouratory experiments, “psychics” have so far failed to move anyobject larger than a compass needle.) According to Kardec’s “informants”,poltergeists are earthbound spirits who are, under certain conditions, able todraw energy from the living and make use of negative energies “exuded” by theemotionally disturbed and the sexually frustrated.In the Amherst case of 1878, poltergeist phenomena began to occur in the home ofan unmarried girl named Esther Cox, who lived with her sister and her sister’shusband, Daniel Teed. After an attempt at abduction and rape, Esther’s boyfriendhad hastily left the area, and Esther was deeply upset. A few days later,rustling noises – sounding like a mouse – came from a box under her bed; a fewnights after that, following a hysterical fit, Esther’s body began to swell likea balloon. There were then two loud bangs, and she ceased swelling and fellasleep. All of this was repeated a few days later; the bedclothes also flew offthe bed, and the pillow inflated. As the family stood around the bed, there wasa scratching noise above it, and an invisible hand or claw traced on the plasterthe words: Esther, you are mine to kill. At a later stage of the manifestation,Esther turned into a human magnet – knives stuck to her – and some iron spokesin her lap became too hot to touch. When spontaneous fires broke out, Esther wasaccused of causing them and sentenced to four months in jail. By the time shewas released, the manifestations had ceased.Ten years later, in 1889, a farm in Quebec province run by a man named GeorgeDagg became the scene of equally bizarre poltergeist manifestations: milk pansoverturned, small fires started, windows smashed, and water poured on the floor.In this case, the “focus” (or the person who seemed to be causing it) was ayoung girl named Dinah McLean, an orphan. The poltergeist often attacked Dinah,making her scream; like Esther Cox, she also seemed to be able to hear it,although no one else could. Later, it began to talk in a gruff voice, utteringviolent obscenities and alleging that it was the Devil. But after some dialoguewith George Dagg – during which it admitted to causing the fires and throwingstones – it declared its willingness to leave the following Sunday. Crowds ofneighbours gathered, and the poltergeist talked freely, seeming to have anintimate knowledge of their lives. (The Fox poltergeist had also been able tosupply all kinds of personal information to the neighbours.) It also allegedthat it was not the “Devil” of the previous day but an angel sent by God; but itproceeded to contradict itself and then lost its temper and used foul language.Finally, it declared that it would leave the following morning after takingleave of the village children. The next morning, the children rushed in from theyard to say that they had just seen a beautiful man in white, who had picked uptwo of them – Mary and Johnny – in his arms and declared that Johnny was a finelittle fellow, then put them down and ascended into the sky. After this, themanifestations ceased.In both these cases, the poltergeist masqueraded as some kind of demonic entitybut was clearly nothing of the sort – an observation that seems to suggest thatpoltergeists, like the devils of Loudun, are probably also “earthbound spirits”.Another investigator who came to believe that “possession” was due to spiritswas Max Freedom Long, an American schoolmaster who arrived in Hawaii in 1917, atthe age of twenty-seven, and began to make a study of its native “magicians”,the kahunas or “keepers of the secret” – the last representatives of the ancientHuna religion. According to Huna belief, Long discovered, man has three“selves”: the “low self”, the “middle self”, and the “high self”. The low selfis basically emotional and corresponds roughly to Freud’s unconscious mind. Themiddle self is our ordinary, everyday consciousness. The high self might becalled the superconscious mind and can foresee the future. After death, thethree selves may become separated, and it is the low self that sometimes becomesa poltergeist, and the middle self may become a “ghost”. In his book describingthese investigations – offputtingly entitled The Secret Science Behind Miracles– Long also discusses the phenomenon of multiple personality and expresses theview that this is often due to “possession”, either by a low self or a middleself or a combination of the two. He describes the case of a California girlwith a secondary personality that took over the body for years at a time. Whendoctors tried to amalgamate the two under hypnosis, a third personalityappeared, who told them that the girl should be left as she was, with twospirits sharing the body. This third personality warned that if they persisted,it would withdraw and leave them with a corpse; Long believed this third personto be the girl’s “high self”.Two more eminent American investigators came to accept the possibility of“possession”. The philosopher William James was converted from his earlyskepticism to a belief in “spirits” through the medium-ship of Mrs LeonorePiper, whose “control”, Phinuit, was able to tell him all kinds of things thathe could not possibly have learned by normal means. James was to agree that if amedium could be “possessed” by a spirit, then it was possible that other peoplemight be and that this could explain cases of “demoniacal possession”.James’s close friend, Professor James Hyslop, was another skeptic who was“converted” by Mrs Piper. But he had a more practical reason for becomingconvinced of the reality of “possession”. When Hyslop was president of theAmerican Society for Psychical Research in 1907, he was visited by a goldsmithnamed Frederick Thompson, who believed that he had become “possessed” by thespirit of a painter named Robert Swain Gifford, whom he had met on a fewoccasions. After Gifford’s death, Thompson had begun to hear Gifford’s voiceurging him to draw and paint – something he had never done before – and althoughhe had no artistic training, Thompson began to paint in Gifford’s style. Whatconvinced Hyslop was that Thompson painted accurate pictures of places that hehad never seen but that Gifford had. Some of these proved to be identical toGifford’s final sketches – which Thompson had never seen – and when Hyslopvisited the New England swamps and coastal regions, he recognized them as thesubject of these sketches.Hyslop consulted a neurologist, Dr Titus Bull, about Thompson. And Bull himselfwent on to conclude that many cases of mental illness really involved“possession”. In one case, the patient, who had suffered a head injury, claimedthat he had been “taken over” by the spirit of a painter named Josef Selleny,who had been a friend of the Emperor Maximilian and who was “forcing” him topaint. (Wickland, as we know, believed that such accidents as head injuriescould provide opportunity for alien “entities” to invade.)Lengthy research by Bull’s assistant, Helen Lambert, finally uncovered theexistence of a real Josef Selleny (the encyclopedias mistakenly spelled hisfirst name Joseph, but the patient spelled it correctly), who had, indeed, beena friend of the Emperor Maximilian. A medium who worked with Dr Bull was able toreveal that the patient was being possessed by several “entities”, one of whomseized possession of her body and grabbed Bull by the throat.Eventually, the various entities were dislodged or persuaded to go away. MrsLambert’s account, later published in her book A General Survey of PsychicPhenomena, sounds remarkably like many cases described by Carl Wickland. The fewavailable cases make it clear that Bull’s name deserves a distinguished place inthe annals of psychical research; unfortunately, most of his records have beenlost.Clearly, views like those of William James and Titus Bull will find noacceptance with the majority of doctors and scientists. Yet in recent years,belief in “possession” as a cause of some mental illness has received supportfrom two eminent psychiatrists, Adam Crabtree and Ralph Allison. In his bookMultiple Man (1986), Crabtree asserts that he has come to accept, merely as aconvenient working hypothesis, the notion that certain multiple personalitiesare “possessed” by spirits, inviting us to believe that he is waiting forsomeone to suggest an alternative psychological theory that will cover all thefacts. But the cases he describes make it virtually impossible to imagine such ahypothesis.Crabtree’s first experience with “possession” involved a young patient namedSarah Worthington, who was in a condition of suicidal depression. In asemitrance state, Sarah spoke in a completely different voice, which soundedlike that of an older woman used to exercising authority. This “voice”identified herself as Sarah’s grandmother and explained that she wanted to “helpSarah”. It began to emerge that the grandmother also had a problem: many yearsearlier, she had left her seven-year-old son alone in the house, then rushedback when she heard that the neighbourhood was on fire. Her son had, in fact,been removed to a safe place by neighbours, but she had spent a traumatic hoursearching for him. Later, her indifference to her daughter, Sarah’s mother (shegreatly preferred her son), had created psychological problems, which had beeninherited by Sarah. Now the grandmother believed that she was trying to helpSarah, who had always felt rejected; in fact, her presence was troubling thegirl, who was intuitively aware that she had been “invaded”. The case soundsoddly similar to many described by Carl Wickland. But in this case, it wasunnecessary to persuade the “spirit” to go away; when Sarah realized that theobscure inner presence she felt was her grandmother, she came to accept it, andall her suicidal impulses vanished.In another case, a girl named Susan was convinced that she was “possessed” byher dead father, who had been killed in a car crash. He had always been sexuallyobsessed with her, creeping into her bedroom when she was asleep to fondle hergenitals; her unconscious knowledge of what was going on made her contemptuousof him. But the close rapport between them meant that when he died, he had foundrefuge in his daughter’s body, unaware that he was dead. When Crabtree was ableto persuade him to leave her, her problems vanished.But from the point of view of “demoniacal possession”, perhaps the mostinteresting case in Crabtree’s book is that of a history professor whom he callsArt. About to be married for the second time, Art was experiencing strangefeelings of reluctance, as if “under great pressure from some inner force thathe could not control”. A censorious inner voice would criticize anyone whom heliked. Art’s own theory was that some negative aspect of his personality hadunconsciously assimilated the critical attitudes of his mother, Veronica, whowas now living in Detroit. When Crabtree placed Art in a light trance, he wasable to open a dialogue with the “mother”, and she told him, “Art is mine andhis life is mine . . . I have to make sure Art knows how kooky all these friendsof his are”.Art’s description of his mother revealed that she was sexually obsessed with herson. Until he was in his late teens, she would call him into her bed when herhusband had left for work and arouse him into a state of sexual excitement thatshe refused to satisfy. Oddly enough, the Veronica who “possessed” Art was alsoaware of herself as “Veronica who lived in Detroit”, and she described the lifeof her alter ego as drab and dull. Crabtree suggested that life might becomemore interesting if she spent more time with “Veronica in Detroit”, and theentity agreed to try it. When Art’s mother had an operation to remove acancerous growth, the entity realized that it had been robbing her of vitalityby concentrating on Art and began spending less time with Art. The realVeronica’s life now underwent a remarkable transformation, and she began seeingmore of people and enjoying herself. Art, surprisingly enough, found he missedthe censorious inner voice and recognized how much he had encouraged it, usingit as an excuse for not making his own decisions. As he faced this fact, hisproblems vanished.Here we may assume either that Art himself was suffering from delusions – areasonable enough hypothesis, under the circumstances – or that, in some oddway, his mother was somehow “possessing” him from a distance, in spite of thefact that she was still alive. This, admittedly, sounds farfetched – until wetake into account the mother’s transformation after her operation. And if Art’smother was somehow “in two places at once”, the implications are very strangeindeed.Can one person “possess” another? In Frederic Myers’s classic Phantasms of theLiving, there is an interesting account of a girl who was convinced that a manshe scarcely knew was taking control of her dreams and trying to force her intosexual slavery (see chapter 60). If this is possible, and if disembodied“spirits” exist, then it would seem to follow that, under certain circumstances,“possession” by a spirit is a possibility.Although Crabtree claims to treat the notion of “possession” merely as a workinghypothesis, it can be seen that his work lends support to the views expressed byWickland. This is even more so in the case of the California psychiatrist RalphAllison, whose Minds in Many Pieces (1980) is a major work in the field ofmultiple personality disorder (usually shortened to MPD). Allison had beenpracticing for almost a decade when he encountered his first case of MPD – awoman named Janette who had tried to kill her husband and children. A colleagueadvised Allison that he thought Janette was a case of MPD, and when Allisoninduced her to relax deeply and asked if he could speak to the “other person”, awoman with a harsh, grating voice emerged and identified herself as Lydia. Atone point, Janette had been raped in the hospital by several orderlies; now, asLydia mentioned her interest in “drinking, dancing, fucking”, and placed herselfin a provocative position, Allison began to suspect that the orderlies may nothave been entirely to blame. Eventually, a third personality named Karen emerged– a balanced, sensible woman – and with her help, Allison was able to cureJanette. (He came to call such personalities “the inner self-helper”.)In this case, the basic hypothesis of multiple personality covered the facts;that a traumatic childhood had caused the “prime personality” to withdraw fromthe problems of life, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand. ButAllison’s next patient, a girl named Carrie, forced him to take the “possession”hypothesis seriously. Carrie was another “multiple” with a history of childhoodtraumas, including a gang rape. Even without hypnosis, an alter ego named Wandaemerged and talked to Allison. But it seemed clear that Wanda was notresponsible for the suicidal impulses Carrie was experiencing. When told that a“psychic” claimed that Carrie was possessed by the spirit of a drug addict whohad died of an overdose in New York in 1968, Allison decided to “give theconcept of spirit possession a try”. Under deep hypnosis, Carrie agreed that thedrug addict was influencing her life, and Allison’s makeshift “exorcism” –performed with a swinging crystal ball on a chain – apparently succeeded.Unfortunately, it failed to dislodge two other personalities, and Carrieeventually committed suicide.Yet Allison continued to reject the notion of “spirit possession” until heencountered a girl named Elise, who revealed several personalities underhypnosis. Most of these were able to describe their history – what traumas hadcaused them to be “born”. But one of them claimed to be a man named Dennis, whoexplained that he had entered Elise’s body when she was experimenting with blackmagic as a teenager and that he enjoyed remaining there because he enjoyedhaving sex with another of Elise’s personalities, a girl named Shannon. The sexwas not, as might be supposed, a bodiless intercourse between two “spirits”;when Shannon took over Elise’s body and had sex with a man, Dennis would enterthe man’s body. And although Elise and Shannon shared the same body, Dennis wasnot interested in having sex with Elise, only with Shannon. Eventually, with thehelp of another “inner self-helper”, Elise was cured. It was this case thatfinally convinced Allison that multiple personality may sometimes be a case ofspirit possession.Another case confirmed this. In curing a girl named Sophia (by “integrating” hervarious personalities), Allison discovered that two personalities remained “leftover”. Under hypnosis, Sophia was regressed to birth and described how thedoctor who had been her mother’s lover had suffocated two triplets at birth buthad been interrupted before he could dispose of the third – Sophia. The othertwo children had then moved into Sophia’s body. Armed with this knowledge,Allison was able to rid Sophia of her two sisters and cure her.Allison concluded that there were many possible causes of multiple personality,such as compulsive neurosis and violent traumas. But he also listed “possession”by another living person – as in the case of “Art” and his mother – possessionby a dead person – as in Dr Bull’s case of the painter Gifford – and possessionby a “nonhuman spirit”. By this he was referring to what would once have beencalled “demoniacal possession”. In a paper on multiple personality, theparapsychologist Stanley Krippner reveals that an increasing number ofpsychiatrists accept the “spirit hypothesis”.What, then, is to be made of this bewildering mass of evidence about“possession”, which most doctors would dismiss as childish fantasy? Belief inpossession depends, clearly, on the prior assumption that “spirits” actuallyexist and that what happens at séances, for example, is genuine “possession” bythe dead. This is doubted by many eminent parapsychologists and even by somemediums themselves; they prefer to believe that all that is involved in suchcases is telepathy and some form of extrasensory perception (ESP). But, as wehave seen, William James himself was finally convinced by Mrs Piper. So wasRichard Hodgson, who had her shadowed by private detectives to see how sheacquired her information – and who learned nothing whatever. But he wasstaggered when Mrs Piper told him about a girl named Jessie, to whom he had beenengaged in Australia and who had subsequently died; Mrs Piper’s “control”,Phinuit, was able to report to Hodgson a conversation with Jessie about which noone else knew.Hyslop himself was inclined to believe that that mediumship was a matter of“super ESP” until he was finally convinced by William James – many years afterJames’s death. Hyslop received a letter from an Irish medium, telling him that aspirit who called himself William James (and of whom the medium had never heard)had asked him to contact Hyslop and remind him of the “red pajamas”. James hadonce agreed with Hyslop that whichever of them died first should try tocommunicate with the other. At first, the message about red pajamas meantnothing to Hyslop. Then he suddenly remembered. When he and James had visitedParis as young men, their luggage had failed to arrive, and Hyslop had beenforced to go out and buy some pajamas. All he had been able to find at shortnotice was a bright red pair, and James had teased him for days about his poortaste in pajamas. It was this message that finally convinced Hyslop of thesurvival of the dead.If, like Hyslop, we can accept the notion of “survival”, and if, like Kardec, wecan accept that spirits can, under certain conditions, share the human brain,then it is hard to see why we should not also accept that they can influencepeople’s actions – that is, “possess” them. It is important to note that“spiritualists” are in general agreement that such “possession” is rare, sinceit is impossible for a spirit actually to dislodge the incumbent, or even toshare the body, unless there is a close affinity between “possessor” and“possessed”.The Loudun case seems to provide support for this view. Kardec states thatpoltergeists can only manifest themselves by stealing human energy, particularlysexual energy. Sister Jeanne’s autobiography makes it clear that her own sexualfrustrations alone could have provided a host of “entities” with the necessaryenergy. And by the time a dozen or so nuns were writhing on the floor and makingsuggestions that caused even hardened roués to blush, the convent must have beenawash with sexual energy. Most cases of possession in nunneries seem to involvethe same feverish sexuality. Two decades before the Loudun case,fourteen-year-old Madeleine de Demandolx de la Palud was seduced by BrotherLouis Gaufridi, twenty years her senior; the liaison was broken up and she wassent to a nunnery at Aix-en-Provence. Two years later Madeleine began to seedevils and smashed a crucifix. Her hysteria soon spread to the other nuns;Madeleine accused Gaufridi not only of seducing her but of introducing her tovarious diabolic practices. Gaufridi was asked to try and exorcise the demons,and when he failed, was put in prison.At his trial, Madeleine declared that her allegations were all imaginings, afterwhich she began to move her hips back and forth in a lascivious manner. Thejudge chose to disbelieve her; Gaufridi was tortured until he “confessed”, thenwas burned at the stake.It is important to realize that fornication among the clergy was a commonplaceoccurrence in the seventeenth century and that seduction of nuns by theirconfessors was far from rare. In 1625 a French orphan named Madeleine Bavent wasseduced by a Franciscan priest, appropriately named Bonnetemps. In the followingyear she entered a convent run by Brother Pierre David, who secretly belonged tothe Illuminati – a sect that believed that the Holy Spirit could do no harm andthat therefore, sex was perfectly acceptable among priests. David apparentlyinsisted that Madeleine should strip to the waist as he administered communion;other nuns, she later claimed, strolled around naked. She claimed that she andDavid never engaged in actual intercourse – only mutual masturbation – and thatwhen David died in 1628, his successor, Brother Mathurin Picard, continued tocaress her genitals during confession.It was after Picard’s death in 1642 (when Madeleine was thirty-five) that thenuns began to manifest the usual signs of possession: writhing on the ground,contorting their bodies, and making howling noises like animals, as they allegedthey were being ravished by demons. Fourteen of the fifty-two nuns exhibitedthese symptoms, and all put the blame on Madeleine.Madeleine then told the full story of David, Picard, and the latter’s assistant,Brother Boulle. She claimed that Picard and Boulle had indulged in various“magical” acts involving communion wafers and menstrual blood and eventually in“sabbats”, in which a Black Mass was recited. The priests had draped theirerections with consecrated wafers with a hole cut in the middle and “thusarrayed gave themselves to the women present” – Madeleine being favoured five orsix times.Madeleine was accused of being a witch and was discharged from the order;Picard’s corpse was dug up, excommunicated, and tossed onto a refuse heap. Thisled the priest’s brother to create a scandal, and the result was a trial thatended with Boulle being tortured and burned alive, together with another priestnamed Duval. Madeleine, confined in a convent and brutally treated, made severalsuicide attempts and finally died at the age of forty. The nuns were alldispersed to other convents.Madeleine’s descriptions of sabbats and Black Masses sound like pure invention.But half a century later the notorious chambre ardente (“lighted chamber”)affair revealed that many priests did, in fact, take part in such practices.When Louis XIV was informed by his chief of police that many women were askingfor absolution for murdering their husbands, he ordered an investigation. Itrevealed that an international poisoning ring, organized by men of influence,existed. A number of fortune-tellers provided their clients with poisons andlove philters, while priests performed Black Masses involving the sacrifice ofbabies and magical ceremonies in which they copulated with women on altars.These facts duly emerged in secret sessions of the “lighted chamber”, and wererecorded in detail. (The king later ordered all records to be destroyed, but theofficial transcript was overlooked.) One hundred and four of the accused weresentenced, thirty-six of them to death, while two of the fortune-tellers wereburned alive. It is difficult for us to understand why the Church was involvedin this wave of demonology – the likeliest explanation is thatseventeenth-century rationalism was undermining its authority and that theprotest against this authority took the form of licentiousness and black magic.Whatever the explanation, the chambre ardente transcripts leave no doubt that itreally happened.One interesting question remains: whether, as Ralph Allison believes, there issuch a thing as possession by “nonhuman” entities – i.e., whether some form of“demoniacal possession” is a reality. Of all these cases involving “possession”,the Loudun affair remains the most puzzling. Even if we can accept Wickland’sbelief that human beings can be influenced by “earthbound spirits”, it isdifficult to understand how five of the exorcists became victims of the demonicpossession and four actually died of it. None of the patients described byWickland, Crabtree, or Allison was driven to this extreme.One possible clue is provided by a curious little book that appeared in CapeTown, South Africa, in 1972. It is entitled Who Are the Dead?, and the author islisted as Helen Quartermaine – which is not, apparently, her real name.The author’s view, briefly, is that in addition to the physical body, all humanbeings possess a “personality body” – also known as the psyche – which is madeof a finer matter than the physical body. This personality body permeates thephysical body – the author uses the image of a ball of wool soaked in water toillustrate how the personality body “imbues” the physical body. The points ofcontact between the two bodies, she says, are the seven endocrine glands, alsoknown as the seven chakras of Hinduism.So far, Helen Quartermaine is simply echoing the “occult tradition”, in whichthe personality body is sometimes called the astral body. (Occult tradition alsorecognizes the human “aura”, or etheric body, which might be regarded as its“life field” – the equivalent of a magnet’s magnetic field.) But she goes on tomake some far more startling assertions. Our problem, she says, is to keep thesethree “bodies” in alignment. In most people the two “higher bodies” tend to jutout of the right side. This lopsidedness means that the left side is unprotectedand can easily be “invaded” by other disembodied personalities. When people getangry or upset, she explains, the personality receives a shock and is displacedsideways. And it may remain this way for a long time. Life force drains awayinto the physical body, and the result is serious depletion. She goes on to say:“Considering the endless list of trifling incidences which can cause a person tobe malpositioned within his three bodies . . . it follows that all of us playhost to our dead, by leaving the door of our physical bodies open to admit them.Worse follows, however, for we must also leave ourselves open to their mental,physical and emotional sicknesses”.She goes on to describe how the dead may attach themselves to those they love.Thus far she is in basic agreement with Wickland. But she then states:“Sometimes, of course, the motivating force is quite the opposite, and hatebecomes the destroying power. There are many well-known cases of revengestriking from beyond the grave”.Ms Quartermaine next cites the case of Barbara Graham, executed in the gaschamber at San Quentin in June 1953 for her part in the murder of an elderlywidow, Mabel Monahan, in the course of robbery. By 1953 Barbara, then thirty,had become a gangster’s moll as well as an alcoholic and drug addict. On 9 Marchshe agreed to help the gang enter Mrs Monahan’s house in Burbank, California, byknocking on the door and asking to use the phone to contact a garage. Her fouraccomplices, Jack Santo, Baxter Shorter, Emmett Perkins, and John L. True,rushed into the house behind her and tied up the sixty-three-year-old widowwhile they searched the house for the fortune she was supposed to be guardingfor the owner of a gambling casino. What actually happened is uncertain; thebody of the woman, strangled with a strip of bedsheet, was found three dayslater by the gardener; her head, wrapped in a pillowcase, had been battered by aheavy blunt instrument.The case was puzzling, since the victim’s purse contained $500, and $10,000worth of jewelry was untouched. But after questioning various underworldfigures, the police called on Baxter Shorter, who – under a promise of completeimmunity – told them that Santo, Perkins, True, and Barbara Graham had beeninvolved. (A man named William Upshaw had also agreed to take part but hadbacked out.) Barbara, he said, had rung the doorbell, and when the old ladyopened the door, True and Perkins had rushed in. When Shorter finally went in tosee what was taking them so long, he saw Barbara pistol-whipping Mrs Monahan.Santo had tied the pillowcase around her head and Perkins had strangled her. Asearch of the house failed to reveal the gambler’s hoard, and they leftempty-handed.Shorter’s story was accepted and he was released. But he was soon kidnapped byPerkins – who was still free – and murdered. Later, Perkins, Santo, and BarbaraGraham were arrested in a motel. Barbara denied that she was present in theMonahan home; whether or not this was true, it is certain that many people incourt did not believe that she had done the beating, as True alleged. But themain evidence against her was that she had attempted to bribe a fellow prisoner– in fact, a police officer – to provide her with an alibi for $2,500. She hadalso told the policeman that Shorter had been “well taken care of”.Barbara Graham was tried, together with Santo and Perkins (her lover). Mainly onTrue’s evidence, she was found guilty. She died in the gas chamber on the sameday as Santo and Perkins (who had been sentenced to death for a second time forthe murder of a whole family committed during the course of robbery).Helen Quartermaine states:> [Barbara Graham] swore she was innocent, but when the verdict found her guilty> she pledged herself to see that all the men concerned with her conviction> would also, like herself, die prematurely.

Santo and Perkins died the sameday, not “at a later date”. John True died in January, not February, 1958, whena Dutch freighter rammed a small craft in a fog. William Upshaw was not the manwho informed the police on Barbara Graham – but he certainly died when he droveinto a road obstruction in California. The “other informer” – Shorter – had diedlong before Barbara Graham.Helen Quartermaine is convinced that these deaths were actually caused byBarbara Graham’s “personality body”, out for revenge. Wickland, as we have seen,believed that such influence is possible and that Harry Thaw killed StanfordWhite under the influence of an entity – or entities – seeking revenge. HelenQuartermaine argues that the kind of lapse of attention that caused WilliamUpshaw to drive his car into an obstruction, or that caused the Dutch freighterin the fog to run down the boat carrying divers (including John True), couldeasily be induced by a “vengeful spirit”.John True and William Upshaw were responsible for the death sentence that sentBarbara Graham to the gas chamber. The Loudun inquisitors were responsible forthe torture of Urbain Grandier and for his agonizing death at the stake. HelenQuartermaine would undoubtedly regard the possession of the Loudun inquisitorsas the revenge of Urbain Grandier on his tormentors.Whether plausible or not, the suggestion may be regarded as a disturbingfootnote to Wickland’s Thirty Years Among the Dead."},{"pageContent":"43 Psychometry“Telescope into the Past”In the winter of 1921 members of the Metapsychic Institute in Paris met togetherto test a clairvoyant. Someone produced a letter and asked someone to pass it toher; before it could reach her it was grabbed by a novelist called PascalForthunny, who said scathingly: “It can’t be difficult to invent something thatapplies to anybody”. He then closed his eyes and pronounced solemnly: “Ah yes, Isee a crime, a murder . . .” When he had finished the man who had brought theletter said: “That was written by Henri Landru”. Landru was the “Bluebeard” whowas then on trial for the murders of eleven women. The sceptic Forthunny haddiscovered that he possessed the curious ability known as psychometry – theability to “sense” the history of an object by holding it in the hand.According to the man who invented the word – an American doctor named JosephRodes Buchanan – it is an ability we all possess, although most of us haveunconsciously suppressed it. Buchanan – who was a professor of medicine inKentucky – came to suspect the existence of such a faculty in 1841, when he meta bishop named Leonidas Polk, who claimed that he could always detect brass whenhe touched it – even in the dark – because it produced a peculiar taste in hismouth. Buchanan was interested in the science known as phrenology – the notionthat the “bumps” on our skulls reveal our characters – and he was interested todiscover that Polk seemed to have a highly developed “bump” of sensibility. Sohe decided to perform a scientific test on students who had a similar bump.Various metals were wrapped in paper, and Buchanan was delighted to discoverthat many of his students could detect brass, iron, lead and so on by merelypressing their fingertips against the paper. They could also distinguishsubstances like salt, sugar, pepper and vinegar.Buchanan concluded that the answer lay in some “nerve aura” in the fingertips,which can detect different metals exactly as we could distinguish them bytouching them with the tip of the tongue. This appeared to be confirmed by hisobservation that it seemed to work better when the hands are damp withperspiration – for after all, a damp skin is more “sensitive” than a dry skin.But this explanation began to seem inadequate when he discovered that one of hisbest “sensitives” – a man named Charles Inman – could sense the contents ofsealed letters, and the character of the writers. Buchanan’s explanation wasthat the “nerve aura” of the writer had left some kind of trace on the letter,and Inman was able to pick up this trace through his own nerve aura. In otherwords, Inman’s “sensitivity” was abnormally developed, in much the same way as abloodhound’s sense of smell. But that theory also broke down when he discoveredthat Inman displayed the same insight when presented with photographs –daguerreotypes – in sealed envelopes. Even the argument that the photograph hadbeen in contact with the “sitter”, and had therefore picked up something of his“nerve aura”, ceased to be convincing when Buchanan discovered that newspaperphotographs worked as well as daguerreotypes.The professor of geology at Boston University, William Denton, read Buchanan’soriginal paper on psychometry – the word means “soul measurement” – and decidedto try it himself. His sister Anne was “highly impressible”, and she proved tobe an even better psychometrist than Inman; she was not only able to describethe character of letter-writers; she was even able to describe their physicalappearance and surroundings.This led Denton to ask himself whether, if a writer’s image and surroundingscould be “impressed” on a letter, “why could not rocks receive impressions ofsurrounding objects, some of which they have been in the immediate neighbourhoodof for years”. So in 1853 Denton began testing his “sensitives” with geologicaland archaeological specimens, “and was delighted to find that without possessingany previous knowledge of the specimen, or even seeing it, the history of itstime passed before the gaze of the seer like a grand panoramic view”. When hehanded his sister a piece of volcanic lava from Hawaii, she was shaken to see“an ocean of fire pouring over a precipice and boiling as it pours”.Significantly, she also saw the sea with ships on it, and Denton knew that thelava had been ejected during an eruption in 1840, when the American navy hadbeen in Hawaii. A fragment of bone found in a piece of limestone evoked apicture of a prehistoric beach with dinosaurs. A fragment of Indian potterybrought a vision of Red Indians. A meteorite fragment brought visions of emptyspace, with the stars looking abnormally large and bright. A fragment of rockfrom Niagara brought a vision of a boiling torrent hurling up spray (which shethought was steam). A piece of stalactite brought an image of pieces of rockhanging down like icicles. To make doubly sure that his sensitives were notsomehow picking up unconscious hints or recognizing the specimens, Dentonwrapped them in thick paper. He also discovered that when he tried the samespecimen a second time – perhaps a month later – it produced the same result,although the picture was never identical.In one of his most interesting experiments he showed his wife a fragment ofRoman tile which came from a villa that had belonged to the orator Cicero. Shedescribed a Roman villa and lines of soldiers; she also saw the owner of thevilla, a genial, fleshy man with an air of command. Denton was disappointed;Cicero had been tall and thin. But by the time Denton came to write the secondvolume of The Soul of Things he had discovered that the villa had also belongedto the dictator Sulla, and that Sulla did fit his wife’s description.Another impressive “hit” was the “vision” induced by a piece of volcanic rockfrom Pompeii. Mrs Denton had no idea what it was, and was not allowed to see it;but she had a vivid impression of the eruption of Vesuvius and the crowdsfleeing from Pompeii. Denton’s son Sherman had an even more detailed vision ofancient Pompeii, complete with many archaeological details – such as an image ofa boat with a “swan’s neck” – which proved to be historically accurate.Denton was immensely excited; he believed that he and Buchanan had discovered aso far unknown human faculty, a kind of “telescope into the past” that wouldenable us to relive great scenes of history. In effect, everything that had everhappened to the world was preserved on a kind of “newsreel” (although this wasnot, of course, an image that occurred to Denton) and could be replayed at will.But while the evidence for the psychometric faculty is undoubtedly beyonddispute, Denton was not aware of how far it can be deceptive. The third volumeof The Soul of Things, published in 1888, contains “visions” of various planetsthat we now know to be preposterous. Venus has giant trees like toadstools andanimals that sound as if they were invented by Hieronymus Bosch; Mars has asummery temperature (in fact it would be freezing) and is peopled withfour-fingered men with blue eyes and yellow hair; Jupiter also has blue-eyedblondes with plaits down to their waists and the ability to float like balloons.Denton’s son Sherman (who was responsible for most of these extraordinarydescriptions) had clearly developed the faculty that Jung calls “activeimagination”, and was unable to distinguish it from his genuine psychometricabilities.What impresses the modern reader about Denton’s Soul of Things and Buchanan’sManual of Psychometry (optimistically sub-titled The Dawn of a New Civilization)is their thoroughly scientific approach. This also impressed theircontemporaries at first. Unfortunately, the period when they were conductingtheir experiments was also the period when the new craze known as Spiritualismwas spreading across America and Europe. It had started with curious poltergeistmanifestations in the home of the Fox family in New York state (see chapter 41)in the late 1840s. By 1860 it was a world-wide phenomenon. Scientists wereappalled, and most of them dismissed it as sheer delusion. Anything that seemedremotely connected with the “supernatural” became the object of the sameskepticism, and the researches of Buchanan and Denton never attracted theattention they deserved. Denton died in 1883, Buchanan in 1900, both in relativeobscurity.The next major experiments in psychometry were made by Dr Gustav Pagenstecher, aGerman who moved to Mexico City in the 1880s, and who regarded himself as ahard-headed materialist. Some time after the First World War, Pagenstecher wastreating the insomnia of a patient called Maria Reyes de Zierold by hypnosis.One day, as she lay in a hypnotic trance, she told him that her daughter waslistening at the door. Pagenstecher opened the door and found the daughterthere. He began testing Maria for paranormal abilities and discovered that whileunder hypnosis she could share his own sensations; if he put sugar or salt onhis tongue she could taste it; if he held a lighted match near his fingers shefelt the heat of the flame. Then he began testing her for psychometricabilities. Like Denton’s subjects, she could describe where some specimen camefrom. Holding a sea-shell, she described an underwater scene; holding a piece ofmeteorite, she described hurtling through space and down through the earth’satmosphere. (“I am horrified! My God”!) Dr Walter Franklin Prince, who testedher on behalf of the American Society for Psychical Research, handed her what hethought was a “sea bean” which he had found on the beach. She described atropical forest. Professional botanists confirmed that the “bean” was a nut froma tree that grew in the tropical forest, and that was often carried down to thesea by the rivers.Another eminent experimenter of the 1920s was Dr Eugene Osty, director of theMetapsychical Institute at which the novelist Pascal Fortunny correctlyidentified the letter from the mass murderer Landru. In his classic workSupernormal Faculties in Man, Osty described many experiments in psychometrywith various “sensitives”. In 1921 he was handed a photograph of a sealed glasscapsule containing some liquid; it had been found near the great temple atBaalbek. One of his best psychics, a Mme Moral, held the photograph in her hand– it was so blurred it could have been of anything – and said immediately thatit reminded her of “a place with dead people”, and of one old man in particular.She “saw” a vast place, like an enormous church, then went on to describe theman, who was obviously a high priest. The capsule in the photograph containedthe blood of a man who had been sacrificed in some distant land, and had beenplaced in the priest’s grave as a memento.At the time Osty himself had no idea what the photograph represented, and wassurprised when the engineer who had found it was able to confirm that it hadbeen discovered in a rich tomb in the Bekaa valley.This story raises again the central problem about psychometry. Buchanan’soriginal hypothesis – that it was simply a matter of “nerve aura”, so thepsychometrist could be regarded as a kind of human bloodhound – ceases to beplausible if the information can be picked up from a photograph, which could notbe expected to retain any kind of “scent”. Even Denton’s assumption that everyobject somehow “photographs” its surroundings seems dubious. In that case apiece of Roman pavement could only have “photographed” a limited area, and MrsDenton’s view of Roman legionaries would have been simply of hairy legs toweringup above her.The likeliest hypothesis is that the faculty involved is what is traditionallyknown as “clairvoyance”, a peculiar ability to “know” what is going on in someother place or at some other time. But Bishop Polk’s ability to distinguishbrass in the dark is obviously not clairvoyance. Here, as in so many other areasof the “paranormal”, it is practically impossible to draw neat dividing lines.Many modern psychometrists – like Gerard Croiset, Peter Hurkos and SuzannePadfield – have been able use their faculty to help the police solve crimes:Suzanne Padfield was even able to help the Moscow police catch a child-murdererwithout leaving her home in Dorset. But it is significant that Croiset dislikedbeing called a psychometrist or clairvoyant, and preferred the more ambiguousword “paragnost” – meaning simply the ability to “know” what lies beyond thenormal limits of the senses."},{"pageContent":"44 Rennes-le-ChâteauThe Treasure of Béranger SaunièreThe mystery of Rennes-le-Château is the riddle of a poor priest who discovered asecret that made him a millionaire and which profoundly shocked the priest towhom he confided it on his deathbed.In June 1885 a new curé came to the little village of Rennes-le-Château, on theFrench side of the Pyrenees; he was 33-year-old Béranger Saunière, and he wasreturning to the area in which he had been brought up. His early account bookssurvive, and they show that he was very poor – the income on which he supportedhimself and his housekeeper was the equivalent of six pounds sterling a year.It was six years later that Saunière decided to restore the church altar, astone slab cemented into the wall and supported at the other end by two squareVisigothic pillars. One of these proved to be hollow, and inside it Saunièrefound four parchments in wooden tubes. Two were genealogies of local families;the other two were texts from the New Testament, but written without the usualspaces between the letters. It seemed fairly obvious that these were in somesort of code – in fact, the code of the shorter text was straightforward.Saunière only had to write down the letters that were raised above the others,and he had a message that read: “A Dagobert II roi et à Sion est ce trésor et ilest la mort”: to Dagobert II, king, and to Sion belongs this treasure, and he isthere dead. (The final phrase “et il est la mort” could also be translated “andit is death” – meaning, perhaps, “it is death to interfere with it”.) So thesesecret messages were about a treasure. Dagobert was a seventh-century Frenchking of the Merovingian dynasty. The author of these parchments was almostcertainly a predecessor of Saunière, a priest named Antoine Bigou, who had beenthe cure of Rennes-le-Château at the time of the French Revolution.Saunière took the parchments to the Bishop of Carcassonne, MonseigneurFélix-Arsène Billard, and the bishop was sufficiently intrigued to send Saunièreto Paris to consult with various scholars and experts in cryptography. Amongthese were the Abbé Bieil, director of St Sulpice. Bieil’s nephew was abrilliant young man named Emile Hoffet, who was a student of linguistics.Although Hoffet was training for the priesthood, he was in touch with many“occultists” who flourished in Paris in the 1890s, an era which had seen arevival of interest in ritual magic; Hoffet introduced Saunière to a circle ofdistinguished artists, which included the poet Mallarmé, the dramatistMaeterlinck and the composer Claude Debussy. It was probably Debussy whointroduced Saunière to the famous soprano Emma Calvé, and the relationship thatdeveloped between them may have been more than friendship – Saunière was a manwho loved women and food.Before he left Paris, Saunière visited the Louvre and purchased reproductions ofthree paintings, including Nicolas Poussin’s Les Bergers d’Arcadie – theShepherds of Arcady – which shows three shepherds standing by a tomb on whichare carved the words “Et in Arcadia Ego” – usually translated as “I [Death] amalso in Arcadia”.When Saunière returned to Rennes-le-Château three weeks later he was hot on thetrail of the “treasure”. He brought in three young men to raise the stone slabset in the floor in front of the altar, and discovered that its underside wascarved with a picture of mounted knights; it dated from about the time of KingDagobert. When his helpers dug farther down they discovered two skeletons, and –according to one of them who survived into the 1960s – a pot of “worthlessmedallions”. Saunière then sent them away, locked the church doors, and spentthe evening there alone.Now Saunière, accompanied by his housekeeper – a young peasant girl named MarieDenarnaud – began to spend his days wandering around the district with a sack onhis back, returning each evening with stones which he used to construct a grottoin his garden. Whether this was the only purpose of his explorations is notknown. He also committed a rather curious piece of vandalism on a grave in thechurchyard. It belonged to Marie, Marquise de Blanchefort, whose headstone hadbeen designed by the same Abbé Bigou who had concealed the parchments in thecolumn. Saunière obliterated the inscriptions on the stone that covered thegrave, and removed the headstone completely. However, he was unaware that bothinscriptions had already been recorded in a little book by a local antiquary.The inscription on the gravestone is shown opposite:The vertical inscriptions on either side of the gravestone are easy to read: amixture of Greek and Latin letters carries the inscription Et in Arcadio Ego –linking it with the Poussin painting. The central inscription: “Reddis RegisCellis Arcis” may be read: “At royal Reddis, in the cave of the fortress”.“Reddis” is one of the ancient names for Rennes-le-Château, which was also knownto the Romans as Aereda.The inscription on the headstone has many odd features. In the first line, the iof ci (ci gît means “here lies”) has been carved as a capital T. The M of Mariehas been left at the end of the first line. The “e” of “noble” is in the lowercase. The word following “negre” should read “Dables” not “Darles”, so shouldhave an R, not a B. Altogether there are eight of these anomalies in theinscription, making up two sets of four, one in capital letters and one in lowercase. The capitals are TMRO, while the lower case are three e’s and a p. Onlyone word can be formed of the capitals: MORT – death. Only one word can beformed of the lower-case letters: epée – sword. In fact these two words provedto be the “keyword” to decipher the longer of the two parchments found in thepillar . . .[images/00003.jpg] Whether Saunière deciphered it alone, or whether his obliging friends at StSulpice unknowingly handed him the vital clues, may never be known. All that isknown is that shortly after this Saunière began spending money at a remarkablerate. He contacted a Paris bank, who sent a representative to Rennes-le-Châteausolely to attend to Saunière’s business. Then he built a public road to replacethe dirt track that had run to the village, and also had a water supply pipedin. He built a pleasant villa with a garden that had fountains and shady walks.To house his library he built a gothic tower perched on the edge of themountainside. He began to collect rare china, antiques and precious fabrics. Hebegan to entertain distinguished visitors, like Emma Calvé and the Secretary ofState for Culture. One of his visitors was recognized as the Archduke Johann vonHabsburg, cousin of Franz- Josef, Emperor of Austria. His guests were given thevery best of food and wine (and it may be significant that Saunière eventuallydied of cirrhosis of the liver).Understandably, Saunière’s superiors were curious about his wealth and wanted toknow where it came from. Saunière told them coolly that he was not at liberty todivulge the source of his wealth – some of it came from rich penitents who hadsworn him to secrecy. He had also been paid well for saying masses for the soulsof the dead. The old bishop decided to mind his own business, but a new onelater revealed a pertinacious curiosity, and when Saunière declined to satisfyit, ordered his transfer to another parish. Saunière declined to be transferred.A new priest was appointed to Rennes-le-Château, but the villagers stillcontinued to treat Saunière as their spiritual pastor. Eventually, in 1917,Saunière suffered a stroke, and died at the age of sixty-four. A priest from aneighbouring parish who was called to his deathbed emerged looking pale andshaken, and a local account, doubtless exaggerated, says that he “never smiledagain”.His housekeeper, Marie Denarnaud, lived on until 1953 in considerable affluence.When after the Second World War the French government issued new currency, anddemanded to know the source of any large sums (the aim being to trap tax-evadersand profiteers) she burned piles of ten-franc notes in the garden, and lived forthe remainder of her life on the proceeds of the sale of Saunière’s villa. Shewas evidently determined not to betray Saunière’s secret. Just before her deathshe confided to the purchaser of the villa that she would tell him a secret thatwould make him both rich and powerful; but she died after a stroke that left herspeechless.The obvious solution to the mystery is that Saunière discovered the treasurementioned in the parchment, and somehow turned it into modern currency. In whichcase the mystery is simply what clues he found in the parchment, and how hefollowed them up to discover the concealed hoard.Henry Lincoln, a modern investigator, became fascinated by the problem afterreading a book called Le Trésor Maudit [The Accursed Treasure], by Gérard deSède, in 1969. He made many visits to Rennes-le-Château, and eventually made aprogramme for BBC television called “The Lost Treasure of Jerusalem . . .?”Lincoln went to Paris to see Gérard de Sède, and before the programme was madede Sède had presented him with the solution of the “long cipher” from theVisigothic column. De Sède claimed that this had been broken with the help ofFrench army experts who had used a computer. Lincoln suspected that this wasuntrue, and British Intelligence confirmed his suspicion that the code could nothave been broken by computer.The code was unbelievably complex – so complex that Lincoln does not evenattempt to explain it in the book he later wrote on the mystery. Cracking itinvolved a technique known to cipher experts as the Vigenère process, whichinvolves writing out the alphabet twenty-six times in a square, with the firstline beginning with A, the second with B, the third with C, and so on. Then thekey word Mort Epée is placed over the whole message in this case, of the longerof the two parchments and the letters are transformed by a simple process usingthe Vigenère table. But the new text is still meaningless. The next step is tomove each letter one letter farther down the alphabet. It is still meaningless.The next step is to use a new key word on the jumble. This new key word is theentire text of the headstone beginning “Ci gît noble Maria” etc, and to takefrom the gravestone the two lots of letters “P.S” and “Prae cum” (Latin for“before” and “with”). This new “keyword” is applied backward to the text, endingwith “P.S.” and “Prae cum”. Then all the letters are moved two spaces down thealphabet. Next, the text is divided into two groups of 64, and these are laidout on two chessboards, and the knight makes a series of knight’s moves on thechessboards. Then the letter contained in each square of this series is writtendown. And now at last the message emerges – although it still looks quiteabsurd. The message runs: BERGERE PAS DE TENTATION QUE POUSSIN TENIERS GARDENTLE CLEF PAX DCLXXXI PAR LA CROIX ET CE CHEVAL DE DIEU J´ACHEVE CE DAEMON DEGARDIEN A MIDI POMMES BLEUES. This may be translated: SHEPHERDESS WITHOUTTEMPTATION TO WHICH POUSSIN AND TENIERS HOLD THE KEY PEACE 681 WITH THE CROSSAND THIS HORSE OF GOD I REACH THIS DAEMON GUARDIAN AT MIDDAY BLUE APPLES.This message, we must presume, led Saunière to the treasure. Which raises theinteresting question: how did he succeed in deciphering the message? True, hehad the all-important “key words” from the grave of Marie de Blanchefort. Buteven if he also knew about the Vigenère table and the knight’s moves, that wouldstill make the decipherment an unbelievably complex task for an ordinary parishpriest without training in cryptography. Leaving aside for the moment the actualmeaning of the message, who handed Saunière the thread that guided him throughthis complex labyrinth?Lincoln concluded, logically, that there must be someone who had already knownsome of the basic answers to the mystery or, more likely, some group ororganization. This, presumably, was the organization from which his owninformant, Gérard de Sède, had received his own information. This guess seemedto be supported by the number of books and pamphlets about Saunière andRennes-le-Château that had appeared since 1956. Many of these were under obviouspseudonyms like “Anthony the Hermit”. They proved to be available in theBibliothèque Nationale, although some of them were curiously difficult to gethold of and one of them was constantly engaged for three months. And it was inthe Bibliothèque Nationale that Lincoln found one of his most vital clues: anumber of miscellaneous items gathered together in stiff covers under the titleDossiers secrets. And one of these documents spoke about a secret order calledthe Priory of Sion. We may recall that the shorter of the two documents Saunièrefound in the pillar ended with the letters P.S., while the longer document – theone containing the “shepherdess” message – is signed with the letters NO-ISwhich back to front reads “Sion”. According to this document, the Grand Mastersof this secret order included the alchemist Nicolas Flamel (who is reputed tohave made gold), Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo – and ClaudeDebussy. Saunière had met Debussy in Paris. This then could explain where he hadreceived the key to the code.And what exactly was the Priory of Sion? It was, according to the SecretDossiers, the inner hierarchy of the order of “warrior monks” called the KnightsTemplars. In the year AD 1118, after the first Crusade had opened the Holy Landto Christian pilgrims, a knight called Hugues de Payens conceived the apparentlyabsurd idea of policing the dangerous roads of the Holy Land with a small bandof knights. They were successful beyond all expectation, and were granted a wingof Solomon’s temple on Mount Sion in Jerusalem as their headquarters. Asgrateful pilgrims left them legacies they became immensely wealthy – they werealso virtually the bankers of the Holy Land. Their downfall came two centurieslater when the French king Philip the Fair (Philippe le Bel) had them allarrested in one sudden swoop – it was 13 October 1307 – and accused them of allkinds of horrible blasphemies and indecencies. Dozens of them were tortured andexecuted, and in 1312 the order was dissolved. Philip had gained his chiefobjective – to lay his hands on their wealth – but he was unsuccessful in hisattempt to seize the treasures of one of their major strongholds, Bezu, which isnear Rennes-le-Château . . .Mount Sion is just outside Jerusalem, and Jerusalem is often referred to as Sionin the scriptures. According to the Secret Dossiers, the Order of Sion (as itwas at first called) was the secret society that originally created theTemplars, and it was unaffected by the latter’s downfall in 1307. And what wasthe purpose of the Priory? It was apparently to restore the Merovingians – thedynasty founded by King Clovis at the beginning of the sixth century AD – to thethrone of France. Later Merovingian kings were distinctly feeble – in fact, theybecame known as “the feeble kings” (rois fainéants) – and left most of the workto their major-domos (or Mayors of the Palace). In AD 679 one of thesemajor-domos organized the murder of King Dagobert II – a lance was driventhrough his eye while he was asleep – and in due course the major-domos becamekings: they were known as the Carolingians.According to the Secret Dossiers, Dagobert’s son Sigisbert fled south toLanguedoc, and inherited the title duke of Razés and count of Rhedae from hisuncle. Rhedae is another old name for Rennes-le-Château (which was then a largetown), and Razés is the name of the county (or comté) in which Rennes issituated. And three centuries later, another descendant of Dagobert, Godfrey deBouillon, led the First Crusade and freed Jerusalem from the Moslems.It seems rather a strange ambition – to restore to the throne of France adynasty known as “the feeble kings”. Why should anyone bother? It seems asirrelevant and absurd as wanting to restore the Tudors or Stuarts to the Englishthrone. And what connection could there be between this curious aspiration andthe “treasure” that made Saunière a rich man? As Lincoln pursued his researches,he found himself drawn into an increasingly bewildering labyrinth of mystery andrumour.To begin with, Gérard de Sède told him, while he was preparing the originaltelevision programme, that the tomb shown in Poussin’s painting had now beendiscovered. It was at a place called Arques, a few miles east ofRennes-le-Château. The tomb is close to the Château of Arques, and is in fact anexact duplicate of the tomb in Poussin’s painting. One can even seeRennes-le-Château in the background of the painting. The first vertical line ofthe tombstone inscription on Marie de Blanchefort’s grave reads “Et in Arc”. Thecentral inscription reads “At royal Reddis in the caves of the fortress”. Anodd-looking circle surrounds the letters P.S. which starts before the P andcurls back so that it ends before the S. The letter before P is O. The letterbefore S is R. O and R together spell “or”, the French for gold. The messageseems to be saying that the gold is at Royal Reddis in the caves of thefortress. Why royal Reddis? Because it is associated with the Merovingian lineof kings . . .So we can being to see why the coded message on the parchment said that Poussinheld the key; it was presumably to this painting it was referring. But themessage also mentioned the painter Teniers, a Flemish artist who was acontemporary of Poussin. What part does he play in the mystery? Lincolndiscovered that there is a copy of Poussin’s Shepherds of Arcady at ShugboroughHall, in Staffordshire – a bas relief which is a reversed mirror image of thepainting. But also at Shugborough Hall there is a painting of St Anthony byTeniers. The temptation of St Anthony was one of Teniers’s favourite subjects.But this one is different – it simply shows St Anthony in meditation: notemptation. And in the background there is a shepherdess. “Shepherdess, notemptation, that Poussin and Teniers hold the key . . .” Shugborough Hall is theseat of the earls of Lichfield, and Lincoln discovered that it had been a hotbedof masonic activity in the seventeenth century. In 1715 one of the earls helpedhis cousin when he escaped from Newgate prison. The cousin was called CharlesRadclyffe, and he is listed in the Secret Dossiers as one of the Grand Mastersof the Priory of Sion. The offence for which Radclyffe was imprisoned was,significantly, aiding the Old Pretender in his attempt on the throne of England.Radclyffe became the secretary of the Young Pretender in France – and presumablyGrand Master of the Priory of Sion – and was executed after Culloden in 1746. Sothere could be good reasons why more clues to the Rennes-le-Château mystery areto be found at Shugborough Hall. Unfortunately, Lincoln found himself unable todecipher these clues.What precisely is the treasure of Rennes-le-Château? The obvious guess is thatit is the treasure of the Templars of Bezu, which Philippe le Bel failed to layhis hands on. And this could well be correct. But there is another clue that iscontained in the longer of the two coded parchments. In the middle of themessage there are twelve letters raised above the others; these have to bediscarded before the decoding process begins. But in addition there are eightsmall letters that occur at random throughout the text, and these spell thewords Rex Mundi, King of the World. This links the message with a religious sectcalled the Cathars, which might be regarded as an early form of Protestantism.The Cathars or “Pure Ones” held a belief that was derived from a much older sectcalled the Manichees: that everything to do with the world of matter is evil,and everything to do with the world of spirit is good. They believed that thisworld was not created by God but by a “demiurge” or demon, who is the King ofthis world. Although they accepted salvation through Christ, they did notbelieve that he was crucified on the cross. This sect of early puritans becameso powerful in the Languedoc – where Rennes-le-Château is situated – that thepope called a crusade against them, and in 1209 a huge army invaded Languedocand murdered thousands of people. The last stand of the Languedoc Catharsoccurred in 1244; the Cathars took refuge in the citadel of Montségur, situatedon a mountain-top. After a ten-month siege they surrendered, and were offeredlenient terms by the besiegers – all who renounced their faith could go free.Heretics who refused to surrender would be burned alive. They were given twoweeks to think about it; at the end of that time two hundred heretics weredragged down the mountain (about two hundred family members were spared) andburnt on a huge pyre. But during those two weeks four men escaped from thecitadel carrying the “treasure” of the Cathars – two months earlier another twoCathars had escaped with more “treasure”. These were not caught.So Saunière’s treasure may have been that of the Cathars of Montségur. Butsurely this cannot have been very substantial – after all, six men scramblingdown a steep mountain-side cannot carry much gold and silver. It is, of course,conceivable that they were carrying some other form of treasure – the holyobjects of the Cathars. But if that is so, what were these holy objects?For completeness we should mention yet another treasure associated with thearea: the treasure of the Visigoths (or Western Goths), the German “barbarians”who played an important part in the downfall of Rome. In Dagobert’s timeRennes-le-Château was a Visigoth bastion, and Dagobert was married to a Visigothprincess. In their triumphant march across Europe the Visigoths accumulated vasttreasures, which seem to have included some of the treasures from the Temple atJerusalem, removed after the Roman emperor Titus took Jerusalem in AD 69. Muchof this treasure was never recovered.But for Henry Lincoln the Priory of Sion materials in the Secret Dossiers wereleading to another and far stranger line of ènquiry. After his first televisionprogramme on Rennes-le-Château (he went on to make three) he received a curiousletter from an Anglican priest which claimed that the treasure did not involvegold or precious stones. It consisted of “incontrovertible proof” that theCrucifixion was a fraud, and that Jesus was still alive as late as AD 45. (Thedate of the crucifixion is usually assumed to be about AD 33.) Lincoln went tosee the priest, who declined to go into detail. But he admitted that hisinformation came from an Anglican scholar named Canon Alfred Leslie Lilley.Lilley had maintained contacts with Catholic scholars based at St Sulpice, andhad been acquainted with Emile Hoffet, the trainee priest who had introducedSaunière to Debussy and others.And it gradually became clear that this was in fact the “great secret” of thePriory of Sion. The real founder of the Merovingian dynasty was not thelegendary King Merovech (or Merovée), but Jesus himself, and this was why thedescendants of the Merovingians felt that they had a right to the throne ofFrance. In the course of his investigations Lincoln had encountered repeatedmentions of the Holy Grail or “Sangreal”. One legend asserted that it was in thepossession of the Templars, another that it was the “treasure” carried downMontségur by the four Cathars. But “sang real” also means “royal blood”. TheGrail was supposed to be the cup from which Jesus drank at the last supper, andGlastonbury legends assert that it was taken there by Joseph of Arimathea. Intwo of the Gospels, Jesus is described as being a descendant of King David, andtherefore of royal blood; the notice “The King of the Jews” displayed above thecross is generally assumed to be sarcasm, but it may have referred to a claimactually made by the close followers of Jesus.It was in a book, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982), co-authored byMichael Baigent and Richard Lee, that Lincoln finally revealed this astonishingtheory. It is difficult to discover from the book how far this is his owndeduction from the evidence, and how far he received the information fromsources like Gérard de Sède, or from M. Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair, whoclaims to be a lineal descendant of Dagobert II, and the chief Merovingianpretender to the throne of modern France. But the theory itself isstraightforward enough. It is that Jesus did not die on the cross – that thesponge that was proffered to him contained a drug. Lincoln points out that Jesusseems to have taken only a few hours to die, while most people took days, evenweeks. His death forestalled the breaking of his legs – an act of mercy thatprevented a crucified man from supporting himself on his nailed feet, andensured his swift suffocation as his weight dragged on his arms. The sponge wasoffered in the nick of time. The theory also involves the assumption that Jesuswas married, and that his wife was probably Mary Magdalene, who may have beenidentical with Mary the sister of Martha and of Lazarus. According to thetheory, Jesus left Palestine and came to Languedoc, although he may have endedhis life at the siege of Masada in AD 74. The hillside tomb depicted by Poussincould well be the actual tomb of Jesus.Whether or not there is historical evidence for this theory, there is certainlyevidence that this is the belief held by the Priory of Sion and by Saunièrehimself. He built himself a tower to house his library and called it the Magdalatower (Magdala being the name of the village from which Magdalene came). Hecalled his house the Villa Bethania, after Bethany, the home of the other Mary,and the place from which two of the disciples fetch the ass on which Jesus ridesinto Jerusalem. Lincoln suggests that the man who provided the ass was Lazarus,and that it was all part of a carefully laid plan which would involve the falsecrucifixion.There is a curious and baffling piece of evidence concerning Nicolas Poussin. In1656 Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV’s Minister of Finance, dispatched his youngerbrother Louis to Rome on a mission that involved a visit to Poussin. On 17 AprilLouis wrote Nicolas a letter commenting that Poussin had displayed “overwhelmingjoy” on receiving the letter Fouquet had sent him. It then goes on:> He and I have planned certain things of which in a little while I shall be> able to inform you fully; things which will give you, through M. Poussin,> advantages which kings would have great difficulty in obtaining from him, and> which, according to what he says, no one in the world will ever retrieve in> centuries to come; and, furthermore, it would be achieved without much expense> and could even turn to profit, and they are matters so difficult to enquire> into that nothing on earth at the present time could bring a greater fortune> nor perhaps ever its equal . . .> > The comment about “advantages which kings would have great difficulty inobtaining (or drawing) from him” is fairly clearly a reference to Louis XIV. Itlooks as if Fouquet is involved in some interesting plot behind Louis’s back.Five years later Fouquet was arrested on vague charges of misappropriation offunds, and finally sentenced to life imprisonment. (One theory suggests that hewas the Man in the Iron Mask.) Louis XIV went to great trouble to obtain thepainting of the Shepherds of Arcady – which is also engraved on Poussin’s tomb –yet instead of placing it on display, kept it in his private apartments.Let us then see if we can begin to piece together the basic outline of thisincredibly complicated story. It begins with Jesus, who is alleged to havearranged his own crucifixion and subsequent “resurrection”, presumably with theaim of “creating faith” and establishing Christianity. Whether or not this istrue, we are invited to believe that the Merovingian dynasty believed that itwas descended directly from Jesus.When Dagobert was murdered the Church endorsed the regicide; Pepin the Short,first of the Carolingians, repaid the pope by taking an army to Italy,inflicting defeats on the pope’s enemies the Lombards, and handing over thecaptured territory, which became the basis of the Papal States. So theMerovingians came to regard themselves as the enemies of the Church of Rome. Asecret society called the Priory of Sion was formed, with the object of placingthe Merovingians back on the throne of France. It held some important sacredobject – possibly the Grail, possibly some “incontrovertible proof” of thedescent of the Merovingians from Jesus. Its secret password was probably thephrase “Et in Arcadia Ego”. In the twelfth century the Knights Templars becamethe military arm of this secret society – which means, presumably, that theyshared the secret about the crucifixion – a secret, we must bear in mind, thatcould have undermined the foundations of the Catholic Church, which was foundedupon the notion of the Vicarious Atonement. No crucifixion, no atonement, noChurch . . .The oddest aspect of the destruction of the Templars was the accusations ofblasphemy and worship of demons. But if the Templars did possess this knowledge,then they were dangerous, both to the Church and to the State (i.e., to thekings of France). There is also much historical evidence of a close alliancebetween the Templars and the Cathars. The Cathars gave large amounts of land tothe Templars, and Bertrand de Blanchefort, fourth Grand Master of the Templars,came of a Cathar family. Bertrand’s descendants fought besides the Cathars ofLanguedoc against the invaders who were sent by the pope to stamp out Catharism.By the sixteenth century the Merovingians were represented by the house ofLorraine (which became Habsburg-Lorraine – so the Habsburgs were alsoMerovingians). They tried hard to depose the ruling house of Valois, butalthough they finally succeeded in bringing about their extinction, they hadexhausted themselves in the process and had no eligible candidate to putforward. When Louis XIII died there was another determined attempt by theconspirators to prevent Louis XIV coming to the throne; but this again failed.(Readers who wish to study this historical aspect in more detail are recommendedto read Lincoln’s fascinating book.)The story of Fouquet’s downfall seems to suggest that he was hoping to use thesecret of the Priory of Sion to overthrow the king. It is not clear how Poussinwas associated with the mystery, but he was presumably a member of the Priory,and was asked to encode its major secret – probably that of the“incontrovertible evidence”, or of the Grail – in his picture The Shepherds ofArcady. Lincoln argues that the painting embodies some secret geometry involvinga pentagram which would enable the “treasure” to be located. King Louis’sinterest in the painting suggests that he hoped to find the treasure first.During the early years of Louis’s reign the Grand Master of the Priory was,according to the Secret Dossiers, a German minister named Johann ValentinAndreae; and this introduces an interesting new complication. Andreae isbelieved to have been the author of a curious work called The Fama Fraternitasof the Worthy Order of the Rosy Cross, published in 1614. This claimed that anascetic called Christian Rosenkreuz, who lived to be 106, had spent his wholelife in a search for occult wisdom, and had founded an order called theBrotherhood of the Rosy Cross, or Rosicrucians. He lay buried in a secret tombfor 120 years, surrounded by lighted candles, before a brother found the tomb.Now, anyone who wished to become party to this secret wisdom only had to maketheir interest known and they would be contacted . . . Many people publishedpamphlets announcing their desire to be initiated but (as far as is known) noneof them was ever contacted. Two more Rosicrucian works were published, andscholarship has established that the author of the third of these, The ChemicalWedding of Christian Rosenkreuz, was Andreae. Rosicrucianism exerted a powerfulinfluence on the minds of scholars and occultists in the seventeenth, eighteenthand nineteenth centuries. Now, according to Lincoln’s sources, Andreae isrevealed as a Grand Master of the Priory (twenty years after publication of theFama), and we are apparently to assume that the Priory of Sion became closelyidentified with the Rosicrucians, and later with the various Masonic lodges.Lincoln writes:> It was in the eighteenth century, however, that the Merovingian bloodline> probably came closest to the realisation of its objectives. By virtue of its> intermarriage with the Habsburgs, the house of Lorraine had actually acquired> the throne of Austria, the Holy Roman Empire. When Marie Antoinette, daughter> of François de Lorraine, became queen of France, the throne of France, too,> was only a generation or so away. Had not the French Revolution intervened,> the house of Habsburg-Lorraine might well, by the early 1800s, have been on> its way to establishing dominion all over Europe.> > With the Revolution, these hopes evaporated. And for some reason the AbbéAntoine Bigou, the priest of Rennes-le-Château and confessor of the Blanchefortfamily (of which, we may recall, one member had been a Master of the Templars)felt that both he and the secret of Rennes-le-Château were in danger. Why is notclear – the sans-culottes could hardly kill every priest in France. Possibly hethought they had been betrayed or were likely to be. At all events, he went tothe trouble of writing the two coded parchments and concealing them, togetherwith the two genealogical tables, in the Visigothic pillar. We do not know whatthe two tables contained – perhaps the line of descent from Jesus down to theliving members of the Priory of Sion. (According to Lincoln’s informant, M.Plantard, the Merovingian Pretender, they are now in a London bank vault.) ThenBigou fled to Spain, where he soon died.So the scene was set for Saunière’s appearance nearly a century later, and forhis discovery of the parchments. What happened then? Saunière went to Paris, andcontacted the very person – Emile Hoffet – who was able to put him in touch withthe modern Priory of Sion. The Priory may well have lost touch with the secretsof Rennes-le-Château, if Bigou had hidden the “treasure”, and so would have beendelighted to see him. We must assume that Saunière accepted the“incontrovertible proof” that Jesus had not died on the cross but had founded aroyal dynasty, and became a member of the Priory. He then returned toRennes-le-Château, and used the knowledge he had gained – presumably fromDebussy – to find the “treasure”. Those excursions in the area, when he claimedto have been collecting stones for a grotto, must have been part of thetreasure-hunt. He found his “treasure”, and became a rich man. But we know thatmuch of his money came from the Habsburg family – at one point he was accused ofbeing an Austrian spy because he was being paid by the Habsburgs – but that someof it was paid to him by the Abbé Henri Boudet, curé of nearby Rennes-les-Bains.Boudet also passed on money to the Bishop of Carcassonne. It would seem, then,that Boudet too was a member of the Priory of Sion.When Saunière died, after enjoying his new-found wealth for less than a quarterof a century, he shocked the priest who administered the final rites byadmitting that he was not, in the strict sense of the word, a Christian. He haddropped hints to the same effect in the restorations in his church: the devilinside the door (Rex Mundi) – Asmodeus, the legendary guardian of Solomon’streasure – and many baffling touches in the tableau of the crucifixion, such asa money bag at the foot of the cross. Over the door he had inscribed the wordsTERRIBILIS ST LOCUS ISTE: this place is terrible. The words are from thededicatory mass sung for new churches, and “terrible” here means“awe-inspiring”; but it still seems odd that Saunière should have chosen themfor the motto of his church, seen immediately before the visitor encounters its“demon guardian”.Lincoln seems to feel that the solution to the mystery of Saunière’s wealth isthat it came from the Priory of Sion. But this is disputed by other writers.Brian Innes, who conducted a four-part investigation of the mystery in amagazine called The Unexplained in 1980, points out that quantities of gold havebeen found in the area. In 1645 a shepherd boy called Ignace Paris was executedfor theft; he was in possession of gold coins, and claimed that he had foundthese after falling down a ravine and finding his way into a cave full oftreasure. Innes says that more recently a slab of gold weighing nearly 45 lb hasbeen found near Rennes-le-Château, made from fused Arab (or Crusader) coins, andthat in 1928 the remains of a large gold statue were found in a hut on the edgeof a stream that flows below the village.In their book The Holy Grail Revealed: The Real Secret of Rennes-le-Château,Patricia and Lionel Fanthorpe also argue strongly that Saunière found realtreasure, not merely some ancient secret. Yet they are also inclined to agreewith Lincoln that there was also some “object” referred to as the Grail whichcould confer power on those who owned it: they compare it to the Ring of Powerin Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, and even suggest in one place, that it might beof “extra-terrestrial origin”, linking Rennes-le-Château with the “ancientastronaut” theories of Erich von Däniken.None of the theories can provide a complete solution to the mystery ofRennes-le-Château, but on the whole Lincoln comes closest to it. For thetwentieth-century reader, the notion that Jesus survived the crucifixion andfounded a dynasty is not particularly “terrible”. Yet we can see that forNicolas Poussin and Louis Fouquet this notion would have seemed hair-raising, akind of spiritual dynamite, sufficient to undermine sixteen centuries ofChristianity and the authority of the pope. Even for Saunière, living at the endof the skeptical nineteenth century, it must have seemed quite startling.Is it likely that we shall ever get to the bottom of the mystery? It is wellwithin the realms of possibility. Presumably the Priory of Sion knows preciselywhat Saunière found near Rennes-le-Château in the hillside tomb or the oldfortress, and its increasing tendency to “go public” may mean that we shallsooner or later be told the whole story. But even if that does not happen, thesolution could still lie in the message on the second parchment – in solving thepuzzle contained in Poussin and Teniers, in working out the meaning of “Peace681” (which could refer to the year 1799, since Templar Freemasons dated thecalender from the year 1118), the horse of God, the demon of the guardian atnoon, and the blue apples. But whoever discovers the secret can be reasonablycertain of one thing: that the treasure itself will be missing.Postscript to Rennes-le-Château Publication of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail in 1982 created a sensation.Suddenly, the little village of Rennes-le-Château became famous, and busloads oftourists arrived every summer – some of them guided by Henry Lincoln himself.Lincoln came to feel that an important part of the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateaulay in the landscape itself.Looking at the code discovered in the parchment, Lincoln noted the phrase:“Poussin holds the key . . .” and, as we have seen, the actual tomb shown inPoussin’s painting was discovered in the area of Rennes-le-Chateau at nearbyArques. And in fact, the tomb, although it had no Latin inscription, wasotherwise identical, even to the stone on which the shepherd in the painting isresting his foot.Lincoln had not only noticed that there was a hidden pentagram in one of theparchments, but that there was something odd about the geometry of Poussin’spainting. He showed it to Professor Christopher Cornford, of the Royal Collegeof Art, and Cornford not only agreed with him that there was a pentagram hiddenin the painting, but that the structure was based on the Golden Section, ageometrical division much used in ancient times. (This is also known by theGreek letter phi, and is basically a way of dividing a line in such a ratio thatthe smaller part is to the greater as the greater is to the whole line – and innumerical terms equals 1.618.) What makes the Golden Section so important isthat nature, for some odd reason, is using it all the time, from spiralseashells to spiral nebulae. It is present in the petal arrangements around theheads of flowers, and in the human body. And for some reason, when used in thedivisions of a painting, it produces an oddly pleasing effect.Now the pentagram is one of the most ancient magical symbols. And the reason isalmost certainly that it was associated with the planet Venus.If we imagine the earth as the centre of the solar system (as the ancientsbelieved it was) it becomes obvious that there will be moments when every planetwill be “eclipsed” by the sun, when the sun comes between the planet and theearth. Mercury, for example, is “eclipsed” three times, and if we draw linesbetween these three points in the heavens, they form an irregular triangle. Marsis “eclipsed” four times, and the figure is an irregular rectangle. In fact, allthe planets make irregular figures – except Venus. And this makes a regularpentagram or pentacle.Now in writing a book called From Atlantis to the Sphinx I had concluded thatastronomy is far, far older than we might imagine. There is even evidence thatit dates back more than a hundred thousand years, to Neanderthal Man. And intheir book Hamlet’s Mill George Santillana and Hertha von Dechend havedemonstrated very clearly that the precession of the equinoxes – that apparentslow backward movement of the constellations, due to a slight wobble on theearth’s axis, which takes almost twenty-six thousand years to complete its cycle– was known to every major civilization of the ancient world. This admittedlysounds absurd, since it would seem to involve many centuries of closeobservation of the heavens. But Santillana and Dechend leave little doubt thatit was so.The implication is that the pentagram symbolizing Venus has been sacred for manythousands of years.Now Lincoln also discovered the pentagram in the geometry of Rennes-le-Chateau.When he looked at an ordnance survey map of Rennes-le-Chateau region, one thingwas immediately obvious: that three of its key sites – Rennes, the TemplarChateau of Bezu, and the Blanchefort chateau – formed three points of atriangle. And all were on hilltops.When Lincoln drew the triangle on his map, and proceeded to measure its lines,he received a surprise. It was a precise isosceles triangle, that is, with twosides exactly equal. With Bezu at the appex of the triangle, the lines from Bezuto Blanchefort, and from Bezu to Rennes-le-Chateau, were equal.This could not be an accident. At some remote point in time, someone hadobserved that the three hilltops made a precise triangle, and in due course theyhad been chosen as part of a secret pattern.Now Lincoln found himself wondering if, by any remote chance, there were twomore hilltops which would form the rest of the pentagram. Of course, he feltthat would be asking too much . . .Yet when he studied the map, he was staggered to find that there were indeed twosuch hilltops, in precisely the right places. The eastern one was called LaSoulane, and the western one Serre de Lauzet. And when the five hilltops werejoined up on the map, they formed an exact pentacle.This was obviously an amazing natural freak. But there was one more surprise tocome. When Lincoln looked for the centre of the map, he found that it was markedby another hill, called La Pique.Admittedly, although the summit of La Pique looked on the map like the deadcentre, it was actually two hundred and fifty yards to the south east of centre.But that was to be expected. After all, this was not a man-made landscape. Itwas incredible enough that La Pique fell at the centre of the pentacle.So this was the basic secret of Rennes-le-Chateau: that it was part of a sacredlandscape. Perhaps this is why Rennes-le-Chateau was chosen by the MerovingianKing Dagobert as his home (and explains why his son Sigisbert fled there afterhis father’s murder). The royal blood of the Merovingians was associated with amagic landscape.The implication is that the goddess to whom the Rennes-le-Chateau “Temple” wasoriginally dedicated was Venus, and explains why Mary Magdalen – who wasidentified with Venus in the Middle Ages – figures so largely in the area.In other words, the whole area of Rennes-le-Chateau was regarded as sacredbecause of its geometry. At the centre of its landscape lay a natural pentagram.That being so, it seems inevitable that in the Christian era, churches would bebuilt so as to conform to this geometrical pattern. And in fact, an enthusiastnamed David Wood studied the map of the area, and quickly discovered that aprecise circle could be drawn through five churches, includingRennes-le-Chateau, connected by a pentacular geometry. His book Genisis containssome remarkable insights into the geometry of the area, which Lincoln (whointroduces the book) acknowledges to be remarkable. However, Lincoln – probablyin common with most readers of the book – is unable to agree with Wood’sexplanation of the mystery, which involves a super-race who came from Syrius200,000 years ago, and became the gods of Ancient Egypt. Such speculations,while fascinating, are obviously unproven and unprovable.But one interesting discovery made by David Wood – and accepted by Lincoln – isthat the geometry of the Rennes-le-Chateau area is, incredibly, measured inEnglish miles, not in kilometres. Lincoln argues effectively that the kilometre(which is supposed to be one ten millionth of the distance from the North Poleto the Equator) is a slipshod and meaningless measurement, and that the worldwould be better off to return to miles.Equally controversial are the speculations contained in a book called The Tombof God (1996) by Richard Andrews and Paul Schellenberger, whose geometricalconstructions leave them to locate the tomb of Jesus at the foot of a mountainnear Rennes-le-Chateau, and who are convinced that Saunière was murdered. But aBBC television programme about the book seemed to demonstrate that the BBC’sattitude to Rennes-le-Chateau had changed since Lincoln’s three programmes, andthat they had become hard line skeptics.What was certainly most absurd was the programme’s attempt to demonstrate thatthe Priory of Sion story, and the whole Rennes-le-Château affair, was a hoaxthat has now been exploded. For even if it could be demonstrated that PierrePlantard, who claims to be a Merovingian descendant of Dagobert, was animposter, the mystery of Saunière and his fortune would remain as baffling asever.Then where did that wealth come from? The answer is almost certainly: not fromany hidden treasure but from the Priory of Sion – that is, from moderndescendants of the Merovingians, particularly the house of Hapsburg in Austria.Andrews and Schellenberger (whose book is excellently researched, even if itsconclusions seem dubious) produce evidence that Henri Boudet, the priest ofnearby Rennes-les-Bains, was Saunière’s paymaster, and that he passed on sumslike three and a half million gold francs to Saunière’s housekeeper MarieDenardaud, and seven and a half million to Bishop Bellard, who appointedSaunière to Rennes-le-Château. It seems clear that there were many other peoplein the secret.As to Pierre Plantard, who seems to have given Lincoln the basic informationthat enabled him to solve the mystery of the parchments, the case against himhas been laid out by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince in a book called The TemplarRevelation. Plantard came to prominence in occupied Paris in 1942 as the GrandMaster of a quasi-Masonic order called The Order of Alpha-Galates, which was“markedly uncritical” of the Nazis. In fact, the Nazis seemed to approve of it.But then, they would; part of Himmler’s job was to establish that the Germanshad a noble origin in the remote days of the Norse sagas, and to create a modernmystical order with its roots in the Aryan past. Pierre Plantard, whom Picknettand Prince describe as “a one-time draftsman for a stove-fitting firm, whoallegedly had difficulty paying the rent from time to time”, then changed hisname to Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair and later played an important part inbringing about the return to power of General de Gaulle in 1958. From 1956, thePriory of Sion had been depositing “enigmatic documents” in the BibliothequeNationale. The implication was that these documents had been concocted as partof the “hoax”. In fact, Lincoln’s books The Holy Place and Key to the SacredPattern make it clear that there is no reason whatever for believing that thePriory of Sion is some kind of hoax or that Pierre Plantard is not exactly whathe says he is.On the other hand, it is necessary to admit that the BBC may have been justifiedin its negative attitude towards The Tomb of God by Andrews and Schellenberger.As already noted, their theory suggests that Jesus is buried at the foot of amountain near Rennes-le-Chateau. They find all kinds of geometrical figures inSaunière’s parchments, then use these as a map to locate the “tomb of God”. Theyadd the word “sum” (am) to “et in Arcadia ego”. to make an anagram that reads “Itouch the tomb of God, Jesus” They suggest that the “blue apples” referred to inSaunière’s parchment are grapes, and that they symbolize the body of Jesus. Thepuzzling phrase “horse of God” they seem to think refers to a railway engine,and an important part in their argument is played by a railway line that wasbuilt in the 1870s. Finally they suggest that Saunière and his two fellowpriests were murdered, for reasons they fail to make clear.Another theory cited by Picknett and Prince holds that the tomb of Jesus issituated under the public toilet in Rennes-le-Chateau.Henry Lincoln’s most powerful argument concerns the actual measurements of theearth. He mentions a remarkable book called Historical Metrology (1953) by amaster engineer named A.E. Berriman, an incredibly erudite volume coveringancient Egypt, Babylon, Sumer, China, India, Persia and many other cultures,which begins with the question: “Was the earth measured in remote antiquity”?,and sets out to demonstrate that indeed it was. It argues that ancient weightsand measures were derived from measuring the earth – which, of course, meansthat ancient people had already measured the earth.The book must have struck Berriman’s contemporaries as hopelessly eccentric. Hesays that one measure was a fraction of the earth’s circumference, that ameasure of land area (the acre) was based on a decimal fraction of the square ofthe earth’s radius, and that certain weights were based on the density of waterand of gold. It sounds almost as if Berriman is positing the existence of someancient civilization which vanished without a trace, except for these ancientmeasures.In the last analysis, one of the most interesting things Lincoln has done, withhis thirty-year investigation of Rennes-le-Chateau, is to demonstrate theexistence of some ancient science of earth measurement. Since medieval times,this science seems to have been in the custody of the Church, and we mustnaturally suspect the involvement of the Templars. But Lincoln is inclined tobelieve that it may be far older even than that – dating back to the age of themegaliths.Berriman seems to be making the same point in Historical Metrology. Hisargument, as noted above, is that prehistoric measurement was geodetic in origin– that is, was derived from the size of the earth.One of his most powerful arguments occurs at the beginning of his first chapter.He points out that although the Greeks did not know the size of the earth, theearth’s polar circumference happens to be precisely 216,000 Greek stade, orstadia. The Greek stade is 600 Greek feet, and the Greek foot is .15 longer thanthe British foot.If we want to find out how many Greek stade there are to one degree of theearth’s circumference, we divide 216,000 by the 360 degrees in a circle. And theanswer, significantly turns out to be 600 – the same as the number of feet inthe stade.If we then divide by 60 – to get the number of stade in one minute of thecircumference – we get 10 stade.And if we go further, and divide again by 60, to find the number of Greek feetin one second of the earth’s circumference, we see that it is precisely 100.This simply cannot be chance. Distances do not normally work out in neat roundfigures. It is obvious (a) that the Greeks took their stade from someone else,and (b) that someone else knew the exact size of the earth.Berriman is full of these puzzling facts – for example, that the area of thegreat bath of Mohenjo Daro, in the Indus Valley, is a hundred square yards.As to this “English connection”, Lincoln has an amusing but fascinatingspeculation. Early in his investigation into Rennes-le-Chateau, he went to theBibliotheque Nationale with Gerard de Sede, and de Sede suggested he shouldrequest a book called Le Vraie Langue Celtique (The True Celtic Tongue) by theAbbe Henri Boudet, who was, as we have noted, priest of nearby Rennes-les-Bains,and a close friend of Saunière.Lincoln was able to obtain Boudet’s book, and found it baffling as well asfunny. Boudet seemed to think that the original language of mankind before theTower of Babel was English, or rather Celtic. This part of the book Lincolndescribes as “linguistic tomfoolery”. And since Boudet was known to be anintelligent man, Lincoln suspects he had his tongue in his cheek. But the volumethen turns into something far more interesting. Boudet goes on to discuss thecomplex megalithic structures of the area. The subtitle of the book is “TheCromlech of Rennes-les-Bains” – a cromlech is a megalith made up of large flatstones resting on two upright stones, rather like a huge dining table.It looks as if Boudet’s job was simply to hint at the mystery of the whole area,and imply that it dates back to megalithic times. But Lincoln is also inclinedto suspect that his intention is to tell his reader that one major key to thesecret of the area lies in English – perhaps in English measures, such as theEnglish mile. And is Boudet also hinting that the original measures of mankindare English – such as the mile?Let me try to summarize the conclusions of this postscript.The Rennes-le-Chateau area appears to be an enormous sacred site centred on anatural pentacle. Lincoln believes it has been sacred for at least a thousandyears, for the “temple” – consisting of churches, castles and villages – musthave been designed at least a thousand years ago.But the pentacular structure of the mountains of the area can only be seen fromthe air or from a good map. And we know that there were no good maps a thousandyears ago, except portolans, the maps sailors used to navigate from port toport. And we will see in the section on the “Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings” thatProfessor Charles Hapgood believed that some of the portolans may date back tothe age when there was no ice covering Antarctica – at least 5.000 BC, andperhaps earlier.A.E. Berriman’s conclusions about the Greek stade point in the same direction.If the ancient Greeks – before Eratosthenes, about 200 BC – did not know thesize of the earth, then how is it possible that the Greek stade should be a veryprecise measure of the earth’s polar circumference? Someone knew the size of theearth. That “someone” may have been the ancient Egyptians, or perhaps even theSumerians, whose civilization dates from around 4,000 BC. But then, neither theEgyptians nor the Sumerians had any means of measuring the size of the earth soprecisely. Was the earth, in fact, measured by some much earlier civilization,dating back long before the Egyptians or the Sumerians? In our book The AtlantisBlueprint, Rand Flem-Ath and I have argued that Antartica was Atlantis and thata great civilization existed in Atlantis – as Plato suggests – as long ago as10,500 BC.But even if a “worldwide maritime civilization” existed at that time, as Hapgoodsuggests, it would still have been virtually impossible to measure the earth’spolar circumference except by the rather inaccurate geometrical means used byEratosthenes. (See Chapter on the Ancient Sea Kings.)Erik van Daniken would undoubtedly argue that the earth was measured fromspacecraft in ancient times. Rand Flem-Ath and I (CW) are both inclined tosuspect that the real answer lies in the notion that civilization may be tens ofthousands of years older than anyone suspects.If that is so, then the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau may stretch back muchfurther than the Templars or the Merovingians and have its origin in some remoteperiod of prehistory."},{"pageContent":"45 Did Robin Hood Really Exist?Next to King Arthur, Robin Hood is the most famous of British heroes, and heshares with King Arthur the indignity of having his existence doubted by modernscholarship. The folklorist Lord Raglan concluded that he was really a Celticgod, while in The God of the Witches Margaret Murray argues that his name meansRobin of the Hood, and that he was probably the devil (or horned god) in ancientwitchcraft festivals. Yet there is also convincing evidence that Robin was areal person, and that – as the ballads declare – he plundered the king’s deer inSherwood Forest and had a long-standing feud with the Sheriff of Nottingham.The first literary reference to Robin Hood occurs in William Langland’s PiersPlowman, dating from around 1377. Langland makes a priest remark that he couldnot say his paternoster without making mistakes, but “I know rhymes of RobynHood and Randolf Earl of Chester”. So there were already ballads of Robin Hoodby that date. In 1510 Wynkyn de Worde, one of the earliest printers, brought outA Lytell Geste of Robyn Hood, which did for Robin Hood what Malory had done forKing Arthur in the middle of the previous century. And by the time he appears inSir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe (1847) Robin had become the boon-companion and allyof Richard the Lion Heart, the heroic outlaw of the woods. All that was neededthen was for some folklorist to notice how often Robin Hood’s name is associatedwith folk festivals, like the Hobby Horse ceremony which takes place on May Dayin Padstow, Cornwall,22[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2238275] to suggestthat Robin Hood was really Robin Wood, and that his name is derived from theNorse god Woden . . . In fact he appears as Robin Wood in T.H.White’s Sword inthe Stone, in which he becomes a contemporary of King Arthur, who (if he everexisted) was said to have died about AD 540.Those who assume there is no smoke without fire are inclined to believe thatRobin Hood was a real outlaw who at some time lived in Sherwood Forest, and whobecame so popular during his own lifetime that, like Billy the Kid, he soonbecame the subject of tales and ballads. Yet it seems unlikely that he wasaround as early as Richard the Lion Heart (1157–99), or he would surely havebeen mentioned in manuscripts before Piers Plowman two centuries later. In hisChronicle of Scotland, written about 1420, Andrew Wyntoun refers to Robin Hoodand Little John for the year 1283, which sounds altogether more likely – about acentury before Piers Plowman.And where precisely did he operate? One important clue is that there is a smallfishing town called Robin Hood’s Bay in Yorkshire, not far from Whitby, and thatup on the nearby moors there are two tumuli (or barrows) called Robin Hood’sButts. Another is that in medieval England the forest of Barnsdale in Yorkshirejoined Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire. A sixteenth-century life of RobinHood among the Sloane Manuscripts says he was born in Locksley, in Yorkshire,about 1160. The Chronicle of Scotland associates Robin with “Barnysale”presumably Barnsdale. So the evidence suggests that he was a Yorkshireman.Later legends declare that he was “Sir Robin of Locksley”, or even the Earl ofHuntingdon. But it is clear from the earlier ballads that he was a yeoman – afarmer who owns his own land – and that this is partly why he became such ahero: not because he was a nobleman, but because he was a representative of thepeople. (A small tenant farmer would be only one stage above a landlesspeasant.)One of the most important clues to Robin’s identity emerged in themid-nineteenth century, when the Historic Documents Commission was cataloguingthousands of documents which represented eight centuries of British history. Itwas in 1852 that the antiquary Joseph Hunter claimed that he had stumbled upon aman who sounded as if he might be the original Robin Hood. His name in fact wasRobert, and he was the son of Adam Hood, a forester in the service of the Earlde Warenne. (Robin was simply a diminutive of Robert – not, in those days, aname in its own right.) He was born about 1280, and on 25 January 1316 RobertHood and his wife Matilda paid two shillings for permission to take a piece ofthe earl’s waste ground in “Bickhill” (or Bitch-hill) in Wakefield. It wasmerely the size of a kitchen garden – thirty feet long by sixteen feet wide. Therent for this was sixpence a year. The Manor Court Roll for 1357 shows a house“formerly the property of Robert Hode” on the site – so by that time Robert Hoodwas presumably dead.Now, 1316 was midway through the reign of Edward the Second, the foppish,homosexual king who was finally murdered – by having a red-hot spit insertedinto his entrails – in September 1327. After his coronation (in 1307) hedismissed his father’s ministers and judges and made his lover, Piers Gaveston,Earl of Cornwall – to the fury of his barons. It was the most powerful of these,Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, who forced Edward to accept the rule of twenty-eightbarons (called Ordainers), and who finally executed Piers Gaveston in 1312.Edward’s lack of attention to affairs of state allowed the Scots – against whomhis father Edward I had fought so successfully – to throw off their Englishmasters. Edward II was defeated at Bannockburn in 1314, two years before RobinHood hired the piece of waste ground and set up home with his wife Matilda. Soit is understandable that when the Earl of Warenne was ordered by the king toraise a troop to fight the Scots Robert Hood failed to oblige, and the recordsshow that he was accordingly fined. But when a second muster was raised in 1317Hood’s name was not listed among those fined – which led J.W.Walker, a modernhistorian, to conclude that this time Robin Hood joined the army. Five yearslater it was the Earl of Lancaster who raised the army, to fight against theking. Again, Hood’s name is not among those fined, so it again seems that heanswered the summons. Lancaster’s army was defeated at Boroughbridge, andLancaster was captured and beheaded. The quarrel had been about Edward’s newfavourites, the Despensers, father and son, whom he had been forced to banish;now he was able to recall them.Many of Lancaster’s supporters were declared outlaws, and Walker discovered adocument that stated that a “building of five rooms” on Bichhill, Wakefield, wasamong the property confiscated. Walker believes that this was Robert Hood’shome, and that the outlaw now took refuge in the nearby forest of Barnsdale,where he soon became a highly successful robber.Now, it must be understood that if Robert Hood was the legendary Robin, and hetook refuge in the forest, living off the deer population, he was riskinghorrible penalties. When William the Conqueror brought the Normans to England hedeclared that the forests – which covered a third of the land – were his ownproperty; any peasant who killed deer risked being literally flayed alive. UnderWilliam the Saxons suffered as much as countries occupied by the Nazis in theSecond World War. Two and a half centuries later the Normans regarded themselvesas Englishmen, and the French language had ceased to be used in England, but thelaws were still harsh. The “forest laws” had been mitigated, so a man could nolonger have his hands or his lips sliced off for poaching a deer; but thepenalty was still a heavy fine, a year’s imprisonment, and sureties for hisfuture good behaviour. If he could not find guarantors he had to “abjure therealm” – quit the kingdom for ever.The battle of Boroughbridge was fought on 16 March 1322, near the Ure river inYorkshire; dismounted men-at-arms and archers drove back the cavalry, thenanother royalist army moved up behind the rebels and forced them to surrender.Lancaster was captured and tried; evidence revealed that he had beencontemplating an alliance with the king’s old enemy Robert the Bruce. Lancaster– the king’s cousin – was beheaded. And Robin Hood, deprived of his home, becamean outlaw in the king’s forest.But if Walker is correct in identifying Robert Hood of Wakefield as Robin Hood,he was not an outlaw for long. In the spring of the following year the king madea progress through the north of England, reaching York on 1 May. From 16 May to21 May he stayed at Rothwell, between Wakefield and Leeds, and spent three dayshunting at Plumpton Park in Knaresborough Forest. And the Lytell Geste makesthis visit a part of the story of Robin Hood, describing how the king “came toPlumpton Park/And failed [missed] many of his deer”. Where the king wasaccustomed to seeing herds of deer, now he could find only one deer “that boreany good horn”. Which made the king swear by the Trinity “I wish I could lay myhands on Robin Hood”:I wolde I had Robyn HodeWith eyen I myght hym se. So, according to this ballad, one of the foresters suggested that the kingshould disguise himself as an abbot, riding through the greenwood with a band ofmonks. The ruse was successful; Robin and his men stopped the “abbot”, butrecognized him as the king. And the king thereupon found Robin so likable thathe invited him to join the royal household as a vadlet, a gentleman of the royalbedchamber. The king continued on his travels until February 1324, when hereturned to Westminster. The royal household accounts for April record paymentof the past month’s wages to Robyn Hod and twenty-eight others. The first recordof a payment to Robyn Hod is in the previous June. The ballad tells us thatafter being a servant of the king for somewhat over a year Robin asked theking’s permission to return to Barnsdale. And the household accounts forNovember 1324 record that Robyn Hod, formerly one of the “porteurs” (gentlemenof the bedchamber) had been given five shillings “because he is no longer ableto work”. The ballad says that Robin asked the king’s leave to return toBarnsdale, and was given permission to stay for seven days. But he neverreturned; instead he regrouped his merry men, and lived on in the greenwood foranother twenty-two years. If this is based on fact, then he died about 1346, inhis mid-sixties.The king’s fortunes took a downward turn after Robin’s departure. He hadrecalled the banished Despensers, and the younger of the two had become his“favourite” – to the disgust of his queen, who had already had to contend withPiers Gaveston. She was a Frenchwoman, daughter of Philip the Fair. Now shebegan to take a romantic interest in an unpleasant and ambitious young baroncalled Roger de Mortimer, who had been thrown into the Tower for his oppositionto the Despensers. Queen Isabella became his mistress, and it was probably shewho plotted Mortimer’s escape. He fled to Paris, and was joined there byIsabella, who was on a mission for the king. They landed at Orwell, in Suffolk,with an army of almost three thousand. When the king heard the news he fled, andwas captured, and imprisoned in Berkeley Castle. He was forced to abdicate, andhis son (aged fifteen) was crowned Edward III. On the night of 21 September 1327horrible screams rang through the castle. The next morning it was announced thatthe king had died “of natural causes”. There were no marks on the body, but itis said that his features were still contorted with agony. A chronicle of somethirty years later states that three assassins entered his cell when he wasasleep, and held down the upper half of his body with a table. Then a horn wasinserted into the anal orifice, and a red-hot iron bar was used to burn out theking’s insides.Mortimer and Isabella ruled England as regents for four years; then the youngking asserted himself, had Mortimer seized in Nottingham Castle, and had himexecuted as a traitor at Tyburn. The loss of her lover almost drove the queenmad. But she was restored to favour, and lived on for another twenty-eightyears.It is of course conceivable that the Robin Hood who lived in Edward’s reign hadno connection with the legendary outlaw of Sherwood Forest; one reference book(Who’s Who In History) says that he was alive in 1230, in the reign of HenryIII, on the grounds that records show that the Sheriff of Yorkshire sold hispossessions in that year (for 32s 6d) when he became an outlaw; but the samereference book admits that the Robyn Hode of Wakefield is also a good contender.There is something to be said for this earlier dating, for it would give moretime for the legend of Robin Hood to spread throughout England. But there isalso a great deal to be said for Robin Hood of Wakefield. If he became an outlawin 1322, as a result of the Lancaster rebellion, then he spent only one year inSherwood Forest before the king pardoned him. The story of his pardon by thehomosexual king certainly rings true – as does his appointment as a gentleman ofthe bedchamber. It is natural to speculate that he may have found that hisduties in the bedchamber involved more than he had bargained for, although atthis time the king’s favourite was the younger Hugh le Despenser (executed byMortimer and Isabella in 1326). So he returned to the greenwood, and became ahero of legend. We do not know whether he became the arch-enemy of the Sheriffof Nottingham, but the sheriff – who would be the equivalent of a modern ChiefConstable – would have been responsible for law and order in Nottinghamshire andsouth Yorkshire, and would certainly have resented a band of outlaws who livedoff the king’s deer. One chronicle states that Robin also had a retreat in whatbecame known as Robin Hood’s Bay, and ships in which he could escape to sea. (Heis also said to have operated as far afield as Cumberland.) If a concertedattempt had been made to flush him out, it would probably have succeeded. Butmost of the peasants and tenant farmers would have been on Robin’s side. Therehad been a time when the forests of England were common land, and half-starvedpeasantry must have felt it was highly unreasonable that thousands of squaremiles of forest should be reserved for the king’s hunting, when the king couldnot make use of a fraction of that area.But there could be another reason that Robin was allowed to operate without toomuch opposition. When he was at court he must surely have met thefourteen-year-old boy who would become Edward III, and Edward would be ofexactly the right age to look with admiration on a famous outlaw. This is onlyspeculation, but it could undoubtedly explain why Robin was allowed to becomethe legendary bane of authority in the last decades of his life.Authority has its own ways of striking back. According to the Sloane Manuscript,Robin fell ill, and went to his cousin, the Prioress of Kirklees, to be bled –the standard procedure for treating any illness in those days. She decided toavenge the many churchmen he had robbed, and allowed him to bleed to death.Another account says that she betrayed him at the request of her lover, SirRoger de Doncaster. Still another source states that the man responsible forRobin’s death was a monk who was called in to attend him, and who decided thatthe outlaw would be better dead. He was buried in the grounds of the nunnery,within a bowshot of its walls. Grafton’s Chronicle (1562) says he was buriedunder an inscribed stone, and a century later another chronicle reported thathis tomb, with a plain cross on a flat stone, could be seen in the cemetery; in1665 Dr Nathaniel Johnstone made a drawing of it; Gough’s Sepulchral Monumentsalso has an engraving of the tombstone. In the early nineteenth century navviesbuilding a railway broke up the stone – it is said they believed its chips to bea cure for toothache. So the last trace of the real existence of Robin Hooddisappeared. But by that time the grave of the prioress had been discoveredamong the ruins of the nunnery, and it bore some resemblance to the tomb ofRobin Hood. It also mentioned her name – Elizabeth Stainton.The real significance of Robin Hood is that he lived in a century when thepeasants were beginning to feel an increasing resentment about their condition –a resentment that expressed itself in the revolutionary doctrines of John Ball,and which exploded in the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, only a short time afterRobin is first mentioned in print by Langland. The Peasants’ Revolt is generallyconsidered to mark the end of the Middle Ages; but it is in the ballads of RobinHood that we can see that the state of mind known as the Middle Ages is comingto an end."},{"pageContent":"46 The Mystery Death of Mary RogersThe mysterious death of the “cigar girl” Mary Rogers, which caused a sensationin New York in the summer of 1841, would hardly cause a raised eyebrow in thesame city today. That the mystery has never been forgotten is largely the workof Edgar Allan Poe, who transformed it into a classic detective story. Half acentury after the death of the cigar girl, information came to light thatsuggested that Poe’s “guess” had been at least partly correct – and that led onewriter to suggest that Poe himself may have committed the murder.Mary Cecilia Rogers was born in New York in 1820; her mother, who became a widowwhen the child was five, supported herself by running a boarding-house in NassauStreet. Mary grew up into a tall, very beautiful young woman with jet-blackhair. This led a cigar-store owner named John Anderson, whose shop was onBroadway, to offer her a job as a salesgirl. In 1840 this was regarded as animaginative piece of business enterprise, for New York was even more “Victorian”than London, and young unmarried girls did not exhibit themselves behind shopcounters, particularly in shops frequented exclusively by young men. Mary’smother objected to the idea, but her daughter’s enthusiasm finally won her over.She drew many new customers to the shop, although – as Thomas Duke is careful tonote in his Celebrated Criminal Cases of America (1910) – “the girl’s conductwas apparently a model of modest decorum, and while she was lavish in hersmiles, she did not hesitate to repel all undue advances”.She had been working in the store about ten months when one day in January 1841she failed to appear. Her mother had no idea where she was, and according toDuke, “Mr Anderson was unable to account for her absence”. The police searchedfor her and the newspapers reported her disappearance. Six days later shereappeared, looking tired and rather ill, and explained that she had beenvisiting relatives in the country. Her mother and her employer apparentlycorroborated the story. But when a rumour began to circulate that she had beenseen during her absence with a tall, handsome naval officer Mary abruptly gaveup her job – only a few days after returning – and was no longer seen onBroadway. A month later she announced her engagement to one of her mother’sboarders, a clerk called Daniel Payne.Five months later, on Sunday 25 July 1841, Mary knocked on her fiancé’s door at10 a.m. and announced that she was going to see her aunt in Bleecker Street;Payne said that he would call for her that evening. Payne also spent the dayaway from home, but when a violent thunderstorm came on towards evening hedecided not to call for Mary, but to let her stay the night with her aunt. MrsRogers apparently approved. But when Mary failed to return home the followingday she began to worry. When Payne returned from work and learned that Mary wasstill away, he rushed to see the aunt in Bleecker Street – a Mrs Downing – andwas even more alarmed when she told him that she had not seen Mary in the pastforty-eight hours.It was two days later on Wednesday morning that three men in a sailing-boat sawa body in the water off Castle Point, Hoboken. It was Mary, and according to theNew York Tribune “it was obvious that she had been horribly outraged andmurdered”. She was fully clothed, although her clothes were torn, and thepetticoat was missing. A piece of lace from the bottom of the dress was embeddedso deeply in the throat that it had almost disappeared. An autopsy performedalmost immediately led to the conclusion that she had been “brutally violated”.Oddly enough, Daniel Payne did not go to view the corpse, although he hadearlier searched for her all over New York, including Hoboken. But after beinginterrogated by the police, Payne was released.A week passed without any fresh clues, and a large reward was offered. Then thecoroner received a letter from some anonymous man – who said he had not comeforward before from “motives of perhaps criminal prudence” – and who claimed tohave seen Mary Rogers on the Sunday afternoon of her disappearance. She had, thewriter said, stepped out of a boat with six rough-looking characters, and gonewith them into the woods, laughing merrily and apparently under no kind ofconstraint. Soon afterwards a boat with three well-dressed men had come ashore,and one of these accosted two men walking on the beach and asked if they hadseen a young woman and six men recently. They said that they had, and that shehad appeared to go with them willingly. At this the trio turned their boat andheaded back for New York.In fact, the two men came forward and corroborated this story. But although theyboth knew Mary Rogers by sight, neither of them could swear that the girl theyhad seen was definitely Mary.The next important piece of information came from a stagecoach-driver namedAdams, who said he had seen Mary arrive on the Hoboken ferry with a well-dressedman of dark complexion, and that they had gone to a roadhouse called “NickMullen’s”. This tavern was kept by a Mrs Loss, who told the police that thecouple had “taken refreshment” there, then gone off into the woods. Some timelater she had heard a scream from the woods; but since the place “was a resortof questionable characters” she had thought no more of it.Two months after the murder, on 25 September, children playing in the woodsfound the missing petticoat in a thicket; they also found a white silk scarf, aparasol and a handkerchief marked “M.R.” Daniel Payne was to commit suicide inthis spot soon after.A gambler named Joseph Morse, who lived in Nassau Street, was arrested andapparently charged with the murder; there was evidence that he had been seenwith Mary Rogers on the evening she disappeared. The following day, he had fledfrom New York. But Morse was released when he was able to prove that he had beenat Staten Island with another young lady on the Sunday afternoon. One odd storyin the Tribune declared that Morse believed that the young lady was Mary Rogers,and that when he heard of the disappearance he assumed she had committed suicidebecause of the way he had treated her – he had tried to seduce her in his room.He was relieved to learn that the girl with whom he had spent the afternoon wasstill alive.In the following year, 1842, Poe’s “Mystery of Marie Roget” was published inthree parts in Snowden’s Ladies’ Companion. But for anyone looking for asolution of the Mary Rogers mystery, it should be treated with extreme caution.Poe argues that Mary Rogers was not murdered by a gang but by a singleindividual. His original view seems to have been that the motive was rape; laterhe heard the rumour that Mary had died as a result of an abortion, and made afew hasty alterations in his story to accommodate this notion. He argues thatthe signs of a struggle in the woods, and the battered state of her face,indicate that she was killed by an individual – a gang would have been able tooverpower her easily. He also speaks of a strip from the girl’s skirt that hadbeen wound around the waist to afford a kind of handle for carrying the body;but the evidence of two witnesses who dragged the body out of the water makes nomention of this “handle”. In spite of this, there can be no doubt that Poe’sobjections to the gang theory carry a great deal of weight.In an issue of a magazine called The Unexplained (No. 152) Grahame Fuller andIan Knight suggest that Poe himself may have been the killer of Mary Rogers. Awitness thought he had seen her with a tall, well-dressed man of swarthycomplexion on the afternoon she died; the authors point out that Poe had anolive complexion and was always well dressed. But Poe was only five feet eightinches tall – hardly a “tall man”. They also argue that Poe may have killed MaryRogers in a fit of “alcoholic insanity”. In 1841 Poe’s wife Virginia was dyingof tuberculosis and he was under considerable stress; he wrote later: “I becameinsane, with long intervals of horrible sanity. During these fits ofunconsciousness I drank, God only knows how often or how much”. Yet none ofPoe’s biographers have ever suggested that he was a violent person – on thecontrary, most emphasize his gentleness and courtesy. There have been plenty ofalcoholic men of genius, a few of whom – like Ben Jonson or Caravaggio – havekilled men in duels or quarrels; but there is not a single example of one whohas ever committed a murder. Besides, no witness suggested that the man who wasseen with Mary Rogers was blind drunk. On the whole, the notion of Poe as ademonic killer, writing “The Mystery of Marie Roget” to boast about his crime,must be relegated to the realm of fantasy.What was not known to Poe in 1842 is that Mary’s employer, John Anderson, hadbeen questioned by the police as a suspect; like all the others, he wasreleased. But fifty years later – in December 1891 – new evidence was to emerge.By that time Anderson had been dead ten years; he became a millionaire, and diedin Paris. Apparently he had told friends that he had experienced “many unhappydays and nights in regard to her” (Mary Rogers), and had been in touch with herspirit. His heirs contested his estate, and in 1891 his daughter tried to breakher father’s will on the grounds that when he signed it he was mentallyincompetent. The case was settled out of court, and the records destroyed. But alawyer named Samuel Copp Worthen, who had been closely associated withAnderson’s daughter Laura Appleton, knew that his firm had kept a copy of thetestimony in the Supreme Court of New York in 1891, and he made it his businessto read it. He finally described what he had learned in the periodical AmericanLiterature in 1948. It revealed that Anderson had been questioned by the policeabout the death of Mary Rogers, and that this had preyed on his mind, so that helater declined to stand as a candidate for mayor of New York, in case someonerevealed his secret.The most significant part of the testimony was the assertion that Anderson hadadmitted to paying for an abortion for Mary Rogers and had got “in some troubleover it”. But he had insisted that he had not “had anything, directly, himself,to do with her problems”.This would obviously explain Mary’s week-long disappearance from the cigarstore, and the fact that she looked tired and ill when she returned. It probablyalso explains why she decided to leave the store a week later – not because ofgossip about the naval officer, but because she needed more time to convalesce.Worthen’s theory is that in the six months after leaving the cigar store Maryagain got herself pregnant, and once more appealed to Anderson for help. Whenshe left home that Sunday morning she intended to go to Hoboken for an abortion.(In fact, there was a story that Mrs Loss, the tavern-owner, had admitted on herdeathbed that Mary Rogers had died during an abortion; there is no hard evidencefor this confession, but it is known that the District Attorney was inclined tothe abortion theory of Mary’s death.) She died during the abortion, and her bodywas dumped in the river to protect the abortionist – the dark-skinned man withwhom she was seen on the ferry – and Mrs Loss’s family.How does this theory fit the known facts? The answer is: very well indeed,particularly if we make the natural assumption that the father of the secondunborn child was Daniel Payne – for it seems unlikely that Mary agreed to marryhim, then continued her affair with her former lover. (Nothing is known aboutthis former lover, but Anderson is obviously a suspect.) We must assume, then,that Payne knew perfectly well that Mary was on her way to Hoboken to have anillegal operation. We may also probably assume that the pregnancy was still inits early stages, and that Mary anticipated very little trouble – after all, shehad recovered from the earlier abortion in a week, though it still left herfeeling ill. Mary’s mother was probably also in the secret. Duke comments: “Itwas generally believed at the time that the murdered girl’s mother knew moreabout her daughter’s mysterious admirer than she chose to tell”.What of the evidence about the gang? It is possible, of course, that a younggirl was actually seen entering the woods with a gang of men, and that this wasnothing to do with Mary Rogers. But it far more probable that the anonymousletter claiming that Mary had entered the woods with six ruffians was sent byMrs Loss or one of her friends – it came from Hoboken. Then all she had to dowas to persuade two of her relatives or friends to claim that they were the menon the beach, and that they had seen Mary enter the woods and seen the boat withthree men that landed shortly afterwards . . . The result would be a perfect redherring, directing the attention of the police away from her own abortionparlour.What of the petticoat found later in the woods? This, significantly enough, wasfound by Mrs Loss’s children. We may assume that the petticoat, the umbrella andthe handkerchief were left behind in Mrs Loss’s roadhouse when Mary’s body wasdragged to the water in the middle of the night, and were later planted in thewoods, in a place where the bushes were broken, to suggest evidence of astruggle.And what of the evidence that Mary had been raped? This, apparently, was thecoroner’s report; we do not know whether she was examined by a doctor or if sowhat the doctor concluded. What we do know is that Mary’s body was alreadydecomposing, and that because of the hot July weather it was buried within a fewhours of being taken out of the water; so any inquest would have been performedin haste. In 1841 the science of legal medicine was in its infancy, and it isdoubtful whether anyone took a vaginal swab and examined it under a microscopefor spermatozoa. What was probably taken for evidence of rape was actuallyevidence of an abortion that had gone wrong.Duke reports that Daniel Payne committed suicide “at the same spot in the woodswhere his sweetheart was probably slain”. Other writers on the case havequestioned this (notably Charles E. Pearce in Unsolved Murder Mysteries, 1924).But Payne’s suicide would certainly be consistent with the theory that he wasthe father of the unborn child.It is a disappointing – if obvious – solution to one of the great “murdermysteries”, that Mary Rogers died in the course of an abortion. Why is it notmore generally known? Partly because Poe himself obscured the truth. In the 1850edition of Poe’s works published in the year after his death “Marie Roget”appeared with a footnote that stated:> It may not be improper to record . . . that the confessions of two persons> (one of them the Madame Dulac of the narrative [Mrs Loss]) made at different> periods long subsequent to the publication confessed, in full, not only the> general conclusion but absolutely all the chief hypothetical details by which> the conclusion was attained.> > But this is obviously impossible. Mrs Loss only seems to have confessed thatMary had died in the course of an abortion in her tavern. Poe’s theory was thatshe was murdered by a man “in a passion” who then dragged her body to theseashore. The likely truth seems to be that she died of an air embolism, andthat the abortionist, with the aid of Mrs Loss, made the death look like murderby tying a strip of cloth round her throat; the two of them then probablycarried it to the water. Poe’s “Marie Roget”, far from being an amazinglyaccurate reconstruction of the murder, is simply a bad guess. Poe may not havebeen a murderer, but he was undoubtedly a liar."},{"pageContent":"47 “Saint-Germain the Deathless”He is still regarded by many “occultists” as one of the most exciting andmysterious figures in the history of magic; some even believe that he is stillalive. But everyone who has written about him has ended by wondering whether thesecrets of “Saint-Germain the deathless” are a matter of mystery or merely ofmystification. Since the enormous dossier on him collected at the orders ofNapoleon III was destroyed by fire during the Commune, the question must remainunanswered. “Thus”, says one historian, “once again an ‘accident’ upheld theancient law which decrees that the life of an adept must always be surrounded bymystery”.When the Comte de Saint-Germain (he admitted the name was false) first appearedin France about 1756 he looked about fifty years old. He was a brilliantconversationalist, spoke many languages, possessed a knowledge of medicine, andwas a first-rate experimental chemist. He was a small man, who dressed in blackvelvet with a white satin cravat (a sign of self-restraint in those days ofmagnificent male wardrobes), and whose manners were meticulously correct. He wasobviously wealthy – he wore many diamonds and he had numerous servants. Theseseem to have been extremely well trained. When a sceptic said to one of them:“Your master is a liar” the man replied: “I know that better than you. He tellseveryone that he is four thousand years old. But I have been in his service onlya hundred years, and when I came the count told me that he was three thousandyears old. Whether he has added nine hundred years by error, or whether he islying, I do not know”. Another servant – his valet – was asked about some pointof ancient history and replied: “Perhaps the count forgets that I have been inhis service only five hundred years”.It sounds as if he was an accomplished leg-puller, or perhaps merely acharlatan; but if so, it is not clear what he hoped to gain. He seems to havebeen wealthy; he was an accomplished violinist, a skilful painter, and had awide knowledge of music and painting – apparently he could identify mostpaintings at a glance. In Historical Mysteries, Andrew Lang suggests that he wasthe son of the ex-queen of Spain, Marie de Neuberg, who lived in Bayonne afterthe death of her husband Charles II. Marie’s lover was the finance minister,Count Andanero, and Lang thinks it possible that Saint-Germain was his son.Before going to France, Saint-Germain had been in Vienna. He had met the Marshalde Belle-Isle, who had contracted some illness while campaigning in Germany;Saint-Germain cured him, and the marshal brought him back with him to Paris.Soon after, he cured a lady of the court of mushroom poisoning, and became afriend of Madame de Pompadour, mistress of Louis XV. The ladies of the courtfound him intriguing. Countess von Gergy, whose husband had been ambassador toVenice around 1710, thought she recollected his name, and asked him if hisfather had been there; Saint-Germain replied – typically – that he himself hadbeen there at the time. “Impossible” said the countess; the man she had knownhad been at least forty-five at the time. Saint-Germain smiled mysteriously. “Iam very old”. He then added various details about Venice, which convinced thecountess that he knew what he was talking about. “You must be a devil”!exclaimed the countess, at which Saint-Germain began to tremble as if he hadcramp and hurriedly left the room.A decade earlier, Saint-Germain had been in London, and in 1745 was arrested asa spy of the Young Pretender, who was just marching on Derby. Horace Walpolenoted in a letter:> . . . the other day they seized an odd man who goes by the name of Count> Saint-Germain. He has been here these two years and will not tell who he is,> or whence . . . He sings, plays on the violin wonderfully, composes, is mad,> and not very sensible. He is called an Italian, a Spaniard, a Pole; a somebody> that married a great fortune in Mexico, and ran away with her jewels to> Constantinople; a priest, a fiddler, a vast nobleman. The Prince of Wales has> had unsatisfied curiosity about him, but in vain . . .> > No one knows where he was between 1745 and 1755. But by the late 1750s he wasthe talk of Paris. Madame du Hausset, a femme de chambre of Madame de Pompadour,wrote:> A man who was as amazing as a witch came often . . . This was the Count de> Saint-Germain, who wished to make people believe that he lived for several> centuries. One day Madame said to him, while at her toilet, “What sort of man> was Francis I . . .”? “A good sort of fellow”, said Saint-Germain, “too fiery> – I could have given him a useful piece of advice but he would not have> listened”. He then described, in very general terms, the beauty of Mary Stuart> and La Reine Margot. “You seem to have seen them all . . .” “Sometimes”, said> Saint-Germain, “I amuse myself, not by making people believe, but by letting> them believe that I have lived from time immemorial”. Then Madame de Pompadour> asked him about Madame de Gergy, who thought she had known Saint-Germain in> Venice fifty years ago. “It may be so”, said Saint-Germain, “But I admit that> even more possibly the respected lady is in her dotage”.> > It seems clear from this that Saint-Germain treated the tales of his great ageas a joke, and made no real attempt to impose them on Madame de Pompadour. Theking’s foreign minister, the Duc de Choiseul, further confused the issue byhiring an impostor to impersonate Saint-Germain in the salons of Paris, and todiscredit him by making absurd claims – such as claiming to have been a closefriend of Saint Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary, and making remarks like “Ialways knew Christ would come to a bad end”.So what do we actually know of the life of Saint-Germain? An autograph letter of1735 proves that he was in The Hague in November of that year, but does not tellus why. Saint-Germain would then be about twenty-five years old. We know he wasin England from 1743 to about 1745, and was arrested as a spy. The story givenin Mrs Cooper-Oakley’s book on him is that someone who was jealous of him(because of a rivalry about a lady) planted a treasonable letter in his pocket,then had him arrested; he was able to prove his innocence.By 1755 he was wealthy and was living in Vienna, where he was taken up by theMarshal de Belle-Isle and brought to Paris, where – as already noted – hisconversation and his wide culture soon made him a favourite of the salons. Heclaimed to live off some food or elixir which he made himself, and would sitthrough dinners without eating. In fact his greatest interest seems to have beenchemistry, and he had apparently discovered some process for dyeing silk andleather. He told the king that he could remove flaws from diamonds, and went offwith a stone worth six thousand francs. A month later he returned the stoneflawless, and a jeweller valued it at ten thousand francs. In all probabilitySaint-Germain simply substituted another stone, and gained the king’s gratitudeat the low price of four thousand francs. The result was that the king set up alabouratory at the Trianon, and installed Saint-Germain in apartments at thecastle of Chambord, to work on his dyeing processes – the king hoped these wouldeventually bring large sums to the royal treasury, which badly neededreplenishing. He became so much a familiar of Louis that the Duc de Choiseulwrote indignantly: “It is strange that the King is so often allowed to be almostalone with this man, though when he goes out he is surrounded by guards. . . .”He also referred to Saint-Germain as “the son of a Portuguese Jew”.In 1760 the king apparently sent Saint-Germain on a diplomatic mission toHolland – although this was kept secret from his ministers; Saint-Germain’smission was to investigate overtures of peace with England – the king was hopingto persuade England to abandon her ally Prussia. Saint-Germain found himselfstaying in the same hotel as that other amusing adventurer Casanova, who wastrying to negotiate a loan for France. They already knew one another, andCasanova was convinced that Saint-Germain was a charlatan. He says of him in hisMemoirs:> This extraordinary man, intended by nature to be the king of impostors and> quacks, would say in an easy and assured manner that he was three hundred> years old, that he knew the secrets of universal medicine, that he possessed a> mastery over nature, that he could melt diamonds. . . . Notwithstanding his> boastings, his bare-faced lies and his manifold eccentricities, I cannot say I> thought him offensive.> > Nevertheless, Casanova seized the opportunity to destroy Saint-Germain’s creditby producing a bogus “cabalistic” oracle warning against him. Meanwhile the Ducde Choiseul had got wind of the plot – he was against making peace – and sentorders for Saint-Germain to be arrested and conveyed to the Bastille. But theDutch Ambassador decided to drop a word in Saint-Germain’s ear, and he took thenext boat to London. Louis was too embarrassed to admit that he and Belle-Islehad been behind Saint-Germain’s mission.Saint-Germain’s enemies had succeeded in bringing about his downfall – althoughthere can be no doubt that his own tactlessness and naivety also played theirpart; he buttonholed the most unsuitable people and told them about his mission.In England he met the German ambassador, and may have hoped to go and joinFrederick the Great in Saxony; the ambassador wrote in haste to the Prussiansecretary of state begging him to do his best to hinder Saint-Germain’s journey,on the grounds that he was dangerously impetuous, and might fascinate the kingand persuade him to undertake “many disastrous measures”. He seems to have hadno doubt of Saint-Germain’s power to fascinate. Saint-Germain was apparentlyobliged to return secretly to Holland, where he purchased an estate, callinghimself Count Surmount – he seems to have been short of cash, for he paid onlypart of the purchase price. The French ambassador described him as “completelydiscredited”. But he had found himself a new patron – or dupe – in Cobenzl,minister in the Austrian Netherlands, who wanted to exploit Saint-Germain’schemical processes in factories at Tournai. Cobenzl told Kaunitz, the Austrianchancellor, of all kinds of “miracles”, such as turning base metals into gold,dyeing silks and other materials all kinds of glorious colours, and tanningskins to produce marvellously soft leather. Cobenzl seemed positively infatuatedwith Saint-Germain, although he added: “The only thing I can reproach him withis frequent boasting about his talents and origins.” And although Cobenzl latercame to take a dim view of the “genius’s” character, he never doubted thetremendous commercial value of his processes. The factories in Tournai were setup, and Saint-Germain managed to pocket a hundred thousand gulden for secrets hehad promised to give gratis. Even so, he vanished without parting with all thepromised secrets. But the factories in Tournai apparently did well – from whichwe may infer that Saint-Germain’s “processes” were genuine enough.Saint-Germain’s movements during the next decade are unknown, but he himselfclaimed to have been twice to India, and to have been involved in theRusso-Turkish war in the Mediterranean (1768–74). He certainly went to StPetersburg and became a friend of Count Alexei Orlov, commander of the Russianexpedition to the Archipelago. His favourite beverage, tea made from sennapods(a mild laxative), became known as Russian tea and was supplied in bulk to theRussian navy. For reasons that are not clear, he was raised to the rank of aRussian general. In 1774 he was living at Schwabach, in Anspach, and foundhimself a new patron, Charles Alexander, margrave of Brandenburg. The margravewas duly impressed when he went with Saint-Germain to meet Orlov and saw thelatter embrace him with great warmth. Soon Saint-Germain was the margrave’sguest in his castle at Triersdorf, living quietly and continuing hisexperiments. He was now calling himself Count Tzarogy. But one day his desire toimpress and astonish led him to tell his host that he was really Prince Rakoczyof Transylvania. But when the margrave visited Italy in the following year, andbegan to tell stories about his astonishing guest, he learned that the lastthree sons of the royal house of Transylvania were dead, and that his guestsounded like the notorious trickster Saint-Germain, who was really the son of atax-collector of San Germano. Gemmingen, the Anspach minister who was sent toconfront Saint-Germain, reported that “Prince Rakoczy” did not deny that hecalled himself Saint-Germain. He had had occasion to use many aliases to avoidhis enemies; but he had never disgraced any of the names he bore. This on thewhole was true, and the margrave had to admit that his guest had always behavedquietly and modestly, and never tried to part him from large sums of money. Allthe same, he was disillusioned, and declined to see Saint-Germain again. So in1776, in his mid-sixties, Saint-Germain once again took to the road. He visitedLeipzig, Dresden, Berlin and Hamburg, then went to Berlin hoping to seeFrederick the Great; but the king had no wish to make the acquaintance of adiscredited adventurer.Finally, Saint-Germain found another patron, Prince Charles of Hesse-Cassel, whowas cool and uninterested to begin with, but gradually succumbed toSaint-Germain’s charm and enthusiasm. Prince Charles was not disposed to doubtany of Saint-Germain’s stories, including that he was Prince Rakoczy, that hehad been brought up in the household of the last of the Medici, and that he wasnow eighty-eight years old. He set Saint-Germain up in a factory in Eckenforde,in Schleswig-Holstein, and there the adventurer lived out his last yearsquietly, suffering periodically from depression and rheumatism, and dying inFebruary 1784, to the grief of Prince Charles, who described him as “one of thegreatest sages who ever lived”.No sooner was Saint-Germain dead than rumours that he was still alive began tocirculate. A journal published in the following year said he was expected toreturn soon. Madame de Genlis was convinced she had seen him in Vienna in 1821.In 1836 a volume of Souvenirs by the Countess d’Adhémar, who claimed to befamiliar with the court at Versailles in the last days of the monarchy, claimedthat she had seen Saint-Germain as late as 1793, and that he had warned herabout the death of Marie Antoinette. He told her she would see him five timesmore, “and do not wish for a sixth”, and she claims that she saw him five timesbetween then and 1820. But G.B. Volz, who conducted an investigation of the lifeof Saint-Germain in the 1920s, asserts that the countess never existed and thatthe Souvenirs are a forgery. In 1845 Franz Graffer declares in his Memoirs thathe had seen Saint-Germain, and that he had announced that he would appear in theHimalayas towards the turn of the century – a claim that in due course ledMadame Blavatsky to include him among her “Secret Masters” in Tibet, and toquote him with respect in The Secret Doctrine. But again, the Memoirs of FranzGraffer are thought to be a forgery. On the other hand, Madame Blavatsky went tothe trouble of visiting the then Countess d’Adhémar in 1885, and MrsCooper-Oakley, whose book on Saint-Germain appeared in 1912, discovered thatthere were still documents about him in the possession of the d’Adhémar family.As late as January 1972, a young man called Richard Chanfray appeared on Frenchtelevision claiming to be Saint-Germain, and apparently transformed lead intogold, using only a camping stove.When all the claims and counter-claims have been taken into account, what can wesay of the “man of mystery”? First – regretfully – that he cannot be takenseriously as a mage or a secret Master. Whether the Prussian ambassador inDresden is correct when he says “inordinate vanity is the mainspring of hismechanism”, there can be no doubt that Saint-Germain was a vain man who talkedtoo much – too many contemporaries make this comment for it to be untrue. But aman may be vain and talkative, and still possess genius (Bernard Shaw being theexample who immediately springs to mind). It is also perfectly clear thatSaint-Germain was a genuine enthusiast, with an extraordinary range of talents.He himself never claimed to be a “mage”, or a student of occultism. In fact, heinsisted that he was a materialist whose chief desire was to benefit humanity.Diderot and D’Alembert would no doubt have found him an ideal contributor totheir Encyclopedia.The real mystery about Saint-Germain is that he was a man of genius, and at thesame time a charlatan. He had what we would now call a strongly developed senseof publicity, a desire to intrigue and fascinate. And this in itself argues thathe was not what he claimed to be. He was undoubtedly not the last survivingmember of the Transylvanian royal family – precise details are known about itslast three surviving members. But this desire to pose as a king in exilesuggests that Saint-Germain was born in fairly humble circumstances, and that hespent a great deal of his childhood and youth daydreaming about fame and glory.The annals of charlatanism are full of Walter Mittys and Billy Liars, but it isdifficult to recollect a swindler who was really born in a palace or a statelyhome. We may probably assume, then, that Saint-Germain was not the bastard sonof the Queen of Spain. But it seems equally clear that he managed to acquirehimself a good education, and that chemistry was the love of his life. Indifferent circumstances he might have become a Lavoisier or Robert Boyle orMichael Faraday. His natural brilliance made him contemptuous of theintelligence of his fellow-men, and when he claimed to be three hundred yearsold, or dropped hints about his acquaintance with Francis I, he probably toldhimself that he was poking fun at human stupidity.The only real mystery is where he acquired the money to pose as a prince. Sincehe seems to have been an honest man (if we except the little affair of theTournai factory), the answer, presumably, is that he was able to turn hischemical researches to commercial use. It is a disappointing conclusion that theMan of Mystery, the Secret Master, was merely a brilliant industrial chemist.But it is the only theory that corresponds to the facts as we know them."},{"pageContent":"48 The Miracles of Saint-MédardThe strange events that took place in the little Paris churchyard ofSaint-Médard between 1727 and 1732 sound so incredible, so preposterous, thatthe modern reader is tempted to dismiss them as pure invention. This would be amistake, for an impressive mass of documents, including accounts by doctors,magistrates and other respectable public figures, attests to their genuineness.The miracles undoubtedly took place. But no doctor, philosopher or scientist haseven begun to explain them.They began with the burial of François de Pâris, the Deacon of Paris, in May1727. François was only thirty-seven years old, yet he was revered as a holyman, with powers of healing. He was a follower of Bishop Cornelius Jansen, whotaught that men can be saved only by divine grace, not by their own efforts. TheDeacon had no doubt whatever that his own healing powers came from God.Great crowds followed his coffin, many weeping. It was laid in a tomb behind thehigh altar of Saint-Médard. Then the congregation filed past, laying theirflowers on the corpse. A father supported his son, a cripple, as he leaned overthe coffin. Suddenly, the child went into convulsions; he seemed to be having afit. Several people helped to drag him, writhing, to a quiet corner of thechurch. Suddenly the convulsions stopped. The boy opened his eyes, lookingaround in bewilderment, and then slowly stood up. A look of incredulous joycrossed his face; then to the astonishment of the spectators he began to danceup and down, singing and laughing. His father found it impossible to believe,for the boy was using his withered right leg, which had virtually no muscles.Later it was claimed that the leg had become as strong and normal as the other.The news spread. Within hours cripples, lepers, hunchbacks and blind men wererushing to the church. At first few “respectable” people believed the stories ofmiraculous cures – the majority of the Deacon’s followers were poor people. Therich preferred to leave their spiritual affairs in the hands of the Jesuits, whowere more cultivated and worldly. But it soon became clear that ignorance andcredulity could not be used as a blanket explanation for all the stories ofmarvels. Deformed limbs, it was said, were being straightened; hideous growthsand cancers were disappearing without trace; horrible sores and wounds werehealing instantly.The Jesuits declared that the miracles were either a fraud or the work of theDevil; the result was that most of the better-off people in Paris flatly refusedto believe that anything unusual was taking place in the churchyard ofSaint-Médard. But a few men of intellect were drawn by curiosity, and theyinvariably returned from the churchyard profoundly shaken. Sometimes theyrecorded their testimony in print: some, such as one Philippe Hecquet, attemptedto explain the events by natural causes. Others, such as the Benedictine BernardLouis de la Taste, attacked the people who performed the miracles on theologicalgrounds, but were unable to expose any deception or error by them, or any erroron the part of the witnesses. The accumulation of written testimony was suchthat David Hume, one of the greatest of philosophers, wrote in An enquiryconcerning human understanding (1758):> There surely never was a greater number of miracles ascribed to one person . .> . But what is more extraordinary; many of the miracles were immediately proved> upon the spot, before judges of unquestioned integrity, attested by witnesses> of credit and distinction, in a learned age. . . . Where shall we find such a> number of circumstances, agreeing to the corroboration of one fact?> > One of those who investigated the happenings was a lawyer named Louis Adrien dePaige. When he told his friend, the magistrate Louis-Basile Carré de Montgéron,what he had seen the magistrate assured him patronizingly that he had been takenin by conjuring tricks – the kind of “miracles” performed by tricksters atfairgrounds. But he finally agreed to go with Paige to the churchyard, if onlyfor the pleasure of pointing out how the lawyer had been deceived. They wentthere on the morning of 7 September 1731. And de Montgéron left the churchyard achanged man – he even endured prison rather than deny what he had seen that day.The first thing the magistrate saw when he entered the churchyard was a numberof women writhing on the ground, twisting themselves into the most startlingshapes, sometimes bending backward until the backs of their heads touched theirheels. These ladies were all wearing a long cloth undergarment that fastenedaround the ankles. M.Paige explained that this was now obligatory for all womenwho wished to avail themselves of the Deacon’s miraculous powers. In the earlydays, when women had stood on their heads or bent their bodies convulsively,prurient young men had begun to frequent the churchyard to view the spectacle.However, there was no lack of male devotees of the deceased Abbé to assist inthe activities of the churchyard. Montgéron was shocked to see that some of thewomen and girls were being sadistically beaten – at least, that is what at firstappeared to be going on. Men were striking them with heavy pieces of wood andiron. Other women lay on the ground, apparently crushed under immensely heavyweights. One girl was naked to the waist: a man was gripping her nipples with apair of iron tongs and twisting them violently. Paige explained that none ofthese women felt any pain; on the contrary, many begged for more blows. And anincredible number of them were cured of deformities or diseases by this violenttreatment.In another part of the churchyard, they saw an attractive pink-cheeked girl ofabout nineteen, who was sitting at a trestle table and eating. That seemednormal enough until Montgéron looked more closely at the food on the plate, andrealized from its appearance as well as from the smell that reached him that itwas human excrement. In between mouthfuls of this sickening fare she drank ayellow liquid, which Paige explained was urine. The girl had come to thechurchyard to be cured of what we would now call a neurosis: she had to wash herhands hundreds of times a day, and was so fastidious about her food that shewould taste nothing that had been touched by another human hand. The Deacon hadindeed cured her. Within days she was eating excrement and drinking urine, anddid so with every sign of enjoyment. Such cases might not be remarkable inasylums; but what was more extraordinary – indeed, preposterous – was that afterone of these meals she opened her mouth as if to be sick, and milk came pouringout. Monsieur Paige had collected a cupful; it was apparently perfectly ordinarycow’s milk.After staggering away from the eater of excrement, Montgéron had to endure aworse ordeal. In another part of the churchyard a number of women hadvolunteered to cleanse suppurating wounds and boils by sucking them clean.Trying hard to prevent himself vomiting, Montgéron watched as someone unwound adirty bandage from the leg of a small girl; the smell was horrible. The leg wasa festering mass of sores, some so deep that the bone was visible. The woman whohad volunteered to clean it was one of the convulsionnaires – she had beenmiraculously cured and converted by her bodily contortions, and God had nowchosen her to demonstrate how easily human beings’ disgust can be overcome. Yeteven she blenched as she saw and smelt the gangrened leg. She cast her eyes upto heaven, prayed silently for a moment, then bent her head and began to lap,swallowing the septic matter. When she moved her face farther down the child’sleg Montgéron could see that the wound was now clean. Paige assured him that thegirl would almost certainly be cured when the treatment was complete.What Montgéron saw next finally shattered his resistance and convinced him thathe was witnessing something of profound significance. A sixteen-year-old girlnamed Gabrielle Moler had arrived, and the interest she excited made Montgéronaware that, even among this crowd of miraculous freaks, she was a celebrity. Sheremoved her cloak and lay on the ground, her skirt modestly round her ankles.Four men, each holding a pointed iron bar, stood over her. When the girl smiledat them they lunged down at her, driving their rods into her stomach. Montgéronhad to be restrained from interfering as the rods went through the girl’s dressand into her stomach. He looked for signs of blood staining her dress. But nonecame, and the girl looked calm and serene. Next the bars were jammed under herchin, forcing her head back. It seemed inevitable that they would penetratethrough to her mouth; yet when the points were removed the flesh was unbroken.The men took up sharp-edged shovels, placed them against a breast, and thenpushed with all their might; the girl went on smiling gently. The breast,trapped between shovels, should have been cut off, but it seemed impervious tothe assault. Then the cutting edge of a shovel was placed against her throat,and the man wielding it did his best to cut off her head; he did not seem to beable even to dent her neck.Dazed, Montgéron watched as the girl was beaten with a great iron truncheonshaped like a pestle. A stone weighing half a hundredweight (25 kilograms) wasraised above her body and dropped repeatedly from a height of several feet.Finally, Montgéron watched her kneel in front of a blazing fire, and plunge herhead into it. He could feel the heat from where he stood; yet her hair andeyebrows were not even singed. When she picked up a blazing chunk of coal andproceeded to eat it Montgéron could stand no more and left.But he went back repeatedly, until he had enough materials for the first volumeof an amazing book. He presented it to the king, Louis XV, who was so shockedand indignant that he had Montgéron thrown into prison. Yet Montgéron felt hehad to “bear witness”, and was to publish two more volumes following hisrelease, full of precise scientific testimony concerning the miracles.In the year following Montgéron’s imprisonment, 1732, the Paris authoritiesdecided that the scandal was becoming unbearable and closed down the churchyard.But the convulsionnaires had discovered that they could perform their miraclesanywhere, and they continued for many years. A hardened skeptic, the scientistLa Condamine, was as startled as Montgéron when, in 1759, he watched a girlnamed Sister Françoise being crucified on a wooden cross, nailed by the handsand feet over a period of several hours, and stabbed in the side with a spear.He noticed that all this obviously hurt the girl, and her wounds bled when thenails were removed; but she seemed none the worse for an ordeal that would havekilled most people.So what can we say of the miracles from the standpoint of the twentieth century?Some writers believe it was a kind of self-hypnosis. But while this couldexplain the excrement-eater and the woman who sucked festering wounds, it isless plausible in explaining Gabrielle Moler’s feats of endurance. These remindus rather of descriptions of ceremonies of dervishes and fakirs: for example,J.G.Bennett in his autobiography Witness describes watching a dervish ritual inwhich a razor-sharp sword was placed across the belly of a naked man, and twoheavy men jumped up and down on it – all without even marking the flesh. Whatseems to be at work here is some power of “mind over matter”, deeper than merehypnosis, which is not yet understood but obviously merits serious attention.It would be absurd to stop looking for scientific explanations of the miraclesof Saint-Médard. But let us not in the meantime deceive ourselves by acceptingsuperficial “skeptical” explanations."},{"pageContent":"49 The Sea Kings of 6000 BCThe Maps That Contradict the History BooksIn 1966 Charles Hapgood, a professor of the history of science, caused somethingof a scandal when he published a book entitled Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings.For what Professor Hapgood was arguing, with a logic that was difficult tofault, was that civilization may be far, far older than historians nowrecognize: that as long as twelve thousand years ago, when man was still awandering hunter, ancient seafarers may have been sailing across the Atlantic.These conclusions were not the outcome of wild speculation, they were thelogical result of the study of old maps that had been available for centuries.The story began in 1956, when a cartographer named M. I. Walters, at the U.S.Navy Hydrographic Office, found himself looking at a copy of a strange map thathad been presented to the Office by a Turkish naval officer. It was obviouslyvery old – in fact, it was dated 919 in the Muslim calendar, which is AD 1513 byChristian reckoning. It was basically a map of the Atlantic Ocean, showing asmall part of North Africa, from what is now Morocco to the Ivory Coast, and allof South America. These were in their correct longitudes, a remarkable – infact, almost unbelievable – achievement for those days, when most maps werelaughably crude. (One of the most famous medieval maps shows Italy joined toSpain; another shows the British Isles shaped like a teapot.) It was also, for1513, an astonishingly accurate map of South America. And what was even moresurprising was that it apparently showed Antarctica, which was not discovereduntil 1818. Oddly enough, it also showed the mid-Atlantic ridge, which seems anunbelievable piece of knowledge for any period before the invention of sonardepth soundings – unless, of course, it had been observed while it was stillabove water.The original mapmaker had been a Turkish pirate named Piri Re’is (Re’is means“admiral”), who had been beheaded in 1554. He had been the nephew of a famouspirate, Kemal Re’is, and had held a high post, equivalent to the governorship ofEgypt. Piri Re’is had made the interesting statement that he had based his mapon twenty old maps, one of them made by Christopher Columbus and others from thegreat library of Alexandria, destroyed by invading Arabs in AD 640.In fact, the Piri Re’is map had been known since 1929, when it had beendiscovered in the Topkapi Palace museum in Istanbul, and there was already acopy in the Library of Congress. But thus far, no one had paid much attention toit. Walters decided to try and remedy that and showed the map to his friend,Captain Arlington H. Mallery, a navigator who was devoting his retirement tostudying old maps. Mallery was allowed to borrow the map, and when he brought itback, he had some startling – indeed, incredible – comments. Mallery agreed thatthe land shown to the south was Antarctica; what was more, the map hadapparently been made before the Antarctic continent was covered with ice. Butthat seemed absurd. The coast of Antarctica had certainly been covered with icein the time of Alexander the Great; the last time men could have seen it withoutice was many thousands of years ago, long before the earliest known maritimecivilizations. And that could only mean one of two things: either that ships hadsailed the seas at a time when, according to historians, our ancestors wereliving in caves, or – what sounded equally outrageous – that there had once beena flourishing civilization on Antarctica itself, whose men made maps that werecopied down through the ages, up to the time of Alexander the Great.These suggestions caused considerable controversy, which came to Hapgood’sattention. He was interested because it sounded as if the Piri Re’is map mightsupport some of the conclusions he had drawn about the movements of the earth’scrust – and would publish in a book entitled Earth’s Shifting Crust in 1958.Hapgood’s starting point had been the puzzle of the great ice ages, which arestill unexplained by science. Hapgood’s own suggestion was that, for someunknown reason, the amount of sunlight varies from age to age. Ice caps formunevenly at the poles, and this lack of balance affects the rotation of theearth – just as an off-balance wheel begins to vibrate as it spins. This,Hapgood suggested, causes masses of ice to dislodge, as well as the tectonicplates to which they are stuck. And the movement of these plates causes acatastrophic shake-up of the earth’s crust. Hapgood estimated that the last suchcatastrophic movement took place between ten and fifteen thousand years ago.Before that, he suggested, Antarctica was 2,500 miles closer to the equator thanit is today and had a temperate climate. Albert Einstein wrote an introductionto the book, in which he declared that Hapgood’s theories deserved carefulattention.When Hapgood learned of Mallery’s views on the Piri Re’is map, he decided that,instead of arguing about whether it was genuine, it would be more sensible tosubject it to careful, detailed study. He therefore assembled a group ofstudents at Keene State College in New Hampshire and set them the task ofstudying a number of ancient maps, including that of Piri Re’is.Hapgood’s first surprise was that the maps known as portolans – those used byseafarers in the Middle Ages (the word means “from port to port”) – had beenknown to scholars for centuries and that no one had paid much attention to them,even though some showed, for example, that Cuba had been known before Columbus“discovered” it in 1492. His next surprise was that these portolans were oftenas accurate as modern maps. It seemed odd that land-based mapmakers should havebeen content with crudities when their marine counterparts were sosophisticated.Hapgood also noted that A. E. Nordenskiold, a leading scholar whose study ofearly maps had appeared in 1889, believed that the portolans of the fifteenthand sixteenth centuries were based on far older maps that dated back centuriesbefore Christ. One of Nordenskiold’s main reasons for this belief was that thegreat geographer and astronomer Ptolemy, who was active in Alexandria around AD150, made maps that were less accurate than these medieval portolans, eventhough he had the greatest library in the world at his disposal. Was it likelythat ordinary medieval seamen, working by rule of thumb, could surpass Ptolemyunless they had some ancient maps to guide them?The arguments Hapgood uses to support this thesis, based on the research of hisstudents, are too long and too technical to describe at length here. But onething that was obvious was that although Piri had combined the twenty maps headmitted using to the best of his ability, he had often allowed them to overlap– or fail to overlap. He had shown the Amazon river twice but had left out anine-hundred-mile stretch of the coastline. The problem was to try to understandhow these errors had come about.One error could be pinned down to the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes, the firstman to calculate the size of the earth with accuracy. He knew that on June 21the sun at midday was reflected in a certain well in Syene, on the Nile, andthat towers did not cast a shadow. But in Alexandria, they did. He had only tomeasure the length of the shadow of a tower in Alexandria at midday on June 21to calculate the angle of the sun’s rays. This proved to be 7 degrees. Since heknew the distance from Syene to Alexandria, he could easily work out how manymiles were required for 360 degrees. Due to a miscalculation of distance,Eratosthenes increased the circumference of the earth by about 4½ degrees; butit was an amazingly accurate calculation for 240 BC. Hapgood discovered that ifhe allowed for this 4½ degree error, Piri’s map became even more accurate. Thiswas an additional piece of evidence that Piri’s map was based on ancient Greekmodels.Another problem is the obvious one known to all geographers – that the earth isa sphere, and a map that is flat is bound to distort it. Today mapmakers use a“projection” based on division into latitude and longitude. But the oldmapmakers, it seemed, used a simpler method. They chose a centre, drew a circlearound it, then subdivided this into sixteen segments, much like dividing a cakeinto sixteen slices. Along the outer edge of every “slice” they drew varioussquares – a complicated method, but one that worked well enough. The originalcentre of the Piri Re’is map was actually off the map, but calculation indicatedthat it had to be in Egypt. At first, Alexandria seemed the obvious place. Butmore careful calculation showed that the place had to be further north. When itturned out to be Syene, Hapgood knew he was on the right track.But this in itself, Hapgood realized, had some interesting implications. Whenthe geographers of Alexandria made their maps – which included Eratosthenes’s 4½degree error – it is unlikely that they sailed off to visit the various placesthey were mapping. They presumably used older maps. And those older maps musthave been incredibly accurate – without the 4½ degree error. This suggests thatthe older mapmakers possessed a more accurate and advanced mapmaking sciencethan the Greeks.In fact, there is one interesting piece of evidence that this is so. Toward theend of the second century BC the Greek grammarian Agatharchides of Cnidus, whowas a tutor to one of the Ptolemy kings of Egypt, was told that, according toancient tradition, one side of the base of the Great Pyramid – built around 2500BC – was precisely one-eighth of a minute of a degree in length – that is, itwas that part of the earth’s circumference. (A minute is a sixtieth of adegree.) The pyramid’s base is just over 230 meters. If 230 is multiplied by 8,then by 60, then by 360, the result is just under foty thousand kilometers, orjust under twenty-five thousand miles – a remarkably accurate estimate of thelength of the equator. Now it is possible, of course, that whoever designed thepyramid chose the length of its base at random and that some later geographer,after Eratosthenes, worked out that it was an eighth of a minute. But ourknowledge of the ancient Egyptians, and the importance they attached to sacredgeometry, suggests that they knew exactly what they were doing – and that theyknew the circumference of the earth in 2500 BC.When Napoléon invaded Egypt in 1798, one of the learned men he took along withhim, Edmé François Jomard, studied the Great Pyramid carefully and made someimportant discoveries: The four sides of the pyramid point to the four points ofthe compass – north, south, east, and west – with incredible accuracy. Thepyramid is ten miles from Cairo, which is at the base of the Nile Delta – socalled because it is a triangle of streams running into the sea – and ifdiagonals are drawn from the pyramid, they neatly enclose the delta. Moreover, aline drawn from exactly halfway along the north face slices the delta into twoexact halves. All of these facts indicate that the ancient Egyptians had someextremely precise method of measuring long distances and did not do it by roughguesswork.The French meter is supposed to be precisely one ten-millionth of the distancefrom equator to pole. Jomard’s study of the pyramid convinced him that theEgyptians had also used a measure based on the earth’s size – in this case, 1divided by 216,000.All of this is staggering. How could a fairly primitive agriculturalcivilization know the size of the earth? What is equally hard to understand iswhy this knowledge had to be rediscovered by Eratosthenes more than two thousandyears later – until we recall that until Columbus sailed to America, there was ageneral belief that the earth is flat. Knowledge can be lost very easily.Hapgood made another interesting discovery from his study of the Piri Re’is map:that the original maps from which it was drawn must have used a slightlydifferent length for the degree of latitude than the degree of longitude. Why?Well, presumably because if you are trying to project the surface of a sphereonto a flat sheet of paper, the lines of longitude get shorter as they drawtoward the poles, while the lines of latitude (since they run parallel acrossthe globe) are less affected. The first European to use this projection methodwas Gerardus Mercator, in 1569. It looked as if the ancient mapmakers hadalready used the same method.Hapgood concluded that the “evident knowledge of longitude implies a peopleunknown to us, a nation of seafarers, with instruments for finding longitudeundreamed of by the Greeks.”What was equally impressive was Hapgood’s confirmation of Mallery’s conclusionthat the coast of Queen Maud Land, on the Antarctic continent, had been drawnwithout the ice sheets. In 1949 an expedition mounted by Norway, Britain, andSweden was able to establish the outline of the land under the ice by varioussophisticated techniques for taking depth soundings through the ice caps. Thisindicated that Piri Re’is probably based his map on some original map of theAntarctic before the Ice Age – which, as we recall, Hapgood had placed (inEarth’s Shifting Crust) between ten and fifteen thousand years ago.The Piri Re’is map was not the only one examined by Hapgood and his students.Hapgood asked the Library of Congress to allow him to look at all the old mapsof the period and was startled to find hundreds of them laid out for hisinspection. It was a 1531 map by one Oronteus Finaeus that filled him with aconviction that he had made a discovery equal in importance to the Piri Re’ismap. It showed the South Pole – which was amazing enough for a date nearly threecenturies before its official discovery. What was positively staggering was thatit was a map of the whole polar cap, as if drawn from the air, showing aremarkable resemblance to the pole as we know it today. And again, all theevidence suggested that it had been made in the days before the pole was coveredwith ice – it, too, showed the coast of Queen Maud Land and mountain ranges nowunder the ice, as well as rivers flowing into the sea. Certain mistakes on themap reappeared in all other contemporary maps, suggesting that all of them hadbeen based on some old map, possibly dating back to Alexander the Great. But the1949 core samples left no doubt that the Antarctic was covered with ice at thetime of Alexander the Great (356–23 BC). So the original maps must have beenmuch older.How much older? The core samples showed that the last warm period in theAntarctic ended six thousand years ago, or around 4000 BC, so the “Antarcticcivilization” posited by Hapgood must have flourished before this. Now this, initself, is not particularly astonishing. Man was fishing ten thousand years agoand began to farm soon after that. Jericho, the oldest market town so fardiscovered, was fortified between eight and ten thousand years ago, and itsinhabitants used polished limestone dishes because they had not yet learned tobake pottery. On the other hand, writing was not invented until about 3500 BC,in Sumeria. Domestication of camels and donkeys was to cause an expansion intrade about five hundred years later. So the Oronteus Finaeus map suggested thatsome kind of writing – because it is hard to conceive of a map without “labels”– must have existed nearly three thousand years earlier. Besides, mapmaking is asophisticated science requiring, among other things, some knowledge of geometry– and the earliest knowledge of geometry seems to date from Babylon about 1500BC, nearly five thousand years later than the “Antarctic civilization.”A Turkish Hadji Ahmed map of 1550 (fourteen years before the birth ofShakespeare) shows the world from a northern “projection,” as if hovering overthe North Pole. Again, the accuracy is incredible. But what may be its mostinteresting feature is that Alaska and Siberia seem to be joined. Since thisprojection shows a heart-shaped globe, with Alaska on one side of the “dimple”and Siberia on the other, this could merely indicate that the map-maker did nothave enough space to show the Bering Strait which divides the continents. Ifthis is not so, the consequences are staggering: we know that a land bridge didexist in the remote past, but it may have been as long as 12,000 years ago.Other early portolans were equally remarkable for their accuracy. The “DulcertPortolano” of 1339, for example, shows that the cartographer had preciseknowledge of an area from Galway to the Don Basin in Russia. Others showed theAegean dotted with islands that do not now exist – they were presumably drownedby melting ice; an accurately drawn map of southern Great Britain, but withoutScotland and with indications of glaciers; and a Sweden still partiallyglaciated.Perhaps the most interesting piece of evidence uncovered by Hapgood is a map ofChina that he found in Needham’s Science and Civilisation in China, dating fromAD 1137 and carved in stone. Hapgood’s studies of Piri Re’is and other Europeanportolans had made him familiar with the “longitude error” mentioned above; nowhe was astonished to find it on this map of China. If he was correct, then theChinese had also known the “original” maps on which Piri Re’is’s map was based.And this, of course, suggested the staggering idea that some worldwide seafaringcivilization had existed before Alexander the Great and that it had disappearedwhile the civilization of Mesopotamia was still primitive and illiterate. Thisis the suggestion that Hapgood – shunning all academic caution – outlines in hisbook’s last chapter, “A Civilisation That Vanished.” He points out that we hadto wait for the eighteenth century to develop an accurate method of measuringlongitude and the circumference of the earth, and until the nineteenth for theexploration of the Arctic and Antarctic. According to Hapgood: “The mapsindicate that some ancient people did all these things.” And this civilizationdisappeared, either in some catastrophe or over a long period of time, and wassimply forgotten. If it existed in Antarctica – and possibly the Arctic – thenits disappearance is easily explained by the return of the ice cap about sixthousand years ago.And what does all this mean? Hapgood was content simply to postulate a maritimecivilization that sailed the seven seas when, according to historians, the onlyseafarers were fishermen who hugged the coasts of the Mediterranean. But otherswere anxious to dot the is and cross the ts. They saw his “advanced civilizationof the Ice Age” as a proof of the real existence of Atlantis, supposedlydestroyed in some great prehistoric catastrophe, while others seized upon it asproof that the earth had been visited by “spacemen” at some remote epoch in thepast. The “ancient astronaut” theory (see chapter 14) was popularized in bookslike The Morning of the Magicians (1960) by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier,and Chariots of the Gods? (1957) by Erich von Däniken. All these speculations –popularized in the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey – had the same effect on thescientists of the 1960s that the Spiritualist explosion of the 1860s had ontheir nineteenth-century predecessors. Serious inquiry was underminded by “guiltby association.” Hapgood ceased to be taken seriously, even by a minority of hisfellow academics.In 1979 a revised edition of Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings: Evidence of AdvancedCivilisation in the Ice Age made reviewers aware that Hapgood did not deserve tobe tarred with the same brush as von Däniken. It is perfectly conceivable thatsome of his arguments may prove to be false and that the mistakes of unskilledmapmakers may explain the extra islands in the Aegean, the missing upper half ofEngland, the mid-Atlantic ridge, and even the land bridge across the BeringStrait. But his main argument remains unaffected. Portolans of the Middle Agesshow Antarctica long before it was explored, and the skill with which they aredrawn suggests that they are based on far older maps. Perhaps the resemblancebetween the Chinese map of 1137 and the portolans is coincidence, and there wasno “worldwide maritime civilization.” But at the very least, there must havebeen some fairly sophisticated civilization long before the so-called birth ofcivilization in Mesopotamia or China – perhaps buried beneath Antarctic ice.Hapgood is inclined to undermine his own case with specious arguments. Forexample, he points out that in Gulliver’s Travels (1726), Swift gives astrangely accurate description of the two moons of Mars, which were notdiscovered for another century and a half. Hapgood suggests that Swift wasrelying on “some ancient source,” when the true explanation is probably thecurious serendipity that can be found so often in the history of art andliterature. (I point out in my book Starseekers that in Eureka, Poe anticipatedthe Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe, as well as the discovery thatatoms can be broken down into positive and negative particles.) In other words,we are dealing with something closer to Jung’s “synchronicity.”To be fair to von Däniken and The Morning of the Magicians, it must also beadmitted that Hapgood’s carefully argued analysis of the portolans does offersome support for the “ancient astronaut” theory. The Oronteus Finaeus map doeslook as if it has been based on an aerial view. So does the 1550 Hadji Ahmed mapof the world seen from above the North Pole. Moreover, it is still difficult tosee how the lines and the vast drawings on the desert floor at Nazca could havebeen drawn by people who were unable to look down on them from the air –although primitive balloons would have been as effective as spacecraft for thatpurpose.But the theories that have appealed to Hapgood’s findings for support (includingthose based on the Oera Linda Book, discussed in chapter 39) cannot be regardedas evidence either for or against his findings. All that is quite certain isthat Hapgood’s evidence for an ancient maritime civilization that preceded anyof those we know is virtually incontrovertible."},{"pageContent":"50 Sea MonstersUnknown Giants of the DeepOn 10 October 1848, the Times of London carried the following report: “When theDaedalus, frigate, Captain M’Quhae, which arrived on the 4th inst., was on herpassage from the East Indies between the Cape of Good Hope and St. Helena, hercaptain, and most of her officers and crew, at four o’clock one afternoon, saw asea serpent”.The report brought a flood of angry letters from naval men who felt that theTimes was failing in its duty to the public by printing such rubbish.Understandably, the public took a different view, and newspapers all over thecountry seized upon the story. A conference was hastily called at the Admiralty,which concluded that an immediate investigation was required.The first step was to contact Captain Peter M’Quhae, to find out whether thereany substance to the story. To the embarrassment of Admiral Sir W. Gage, who wasin charge of the investigation, M’Quhae replied that despite certain glaringinaccuracies, the Times story was essentially correct: he had indeed seen a seamonster. He had noted the event in the ship’s log and had planned to report theincident through normal channels.His story was as follows: At five o’clock on 6 August 1848, while the Daedaluswas between the Cape of Good Hope and St. Helena, one of the midshipmen reporteda strange creature swimming slowly toward them off the starboard bow. Most ofthe crew were at supper, and there were only seven men on deck, including thecaptain, the watch officer, and the ship’s navigator. All of them witnessed whatM’Quhae described as “an enormous serpent” – judged to be about 100 feet long –as it swam in a straight line past the frigate, apparently oblivious to itsexistence. The captain judged it to be travelling at around twelve to fifteenmiles an hour and described how it had remained within the range of theirspyglasses for nearly twenty minutes. Although the afternoon was showery anddull, M’Quhae stated that it was still bright enough to see the creature clearlyand that it swam close enough that “had it been a man of my acquaintance Ishould have easily recognized his features with the naked eye”.He described the large, distinctly snakelike head projecting just above thewaves on a neck about fifteen inches thick, followed by sixty feet or so ofserpentine back, which crested above the surface of the water. The colour wasuniformly dark brown, apart from the throat, which was a yellowish white. ToM’Quhae it seemed to slip through the water effortlessly, without the aid offins or the undulatory swimming typical of snakes and eels. This odd fact may beexplained by a mane of hair or seaweed that ran along its back and that may haveobscured its means of propulsion. At no point did the creature open its mouth toreveal “large jagged teeth” (as the Times had reported). The witnesses had allagreed that it appeared neither frightened nor threatening but rather that itwas traveling forward “on some determined purpose”. M’Quhae had made a sketch ofthe creature which, at the admiral’s request, he converted into a larger drawingto accompany his statement.To the credit of the Admiralty, it quickly made the controversial reportpublicly available. On 13 October the Times printed the report in full, andfifteen days later the Illustrated London News printed several pictures of the“Daedalus sea serpent” based on M’Quhae’s drawing. The “purposeful” sea monsterbecame a subject of sometimes heated national debate.The other six witnesses named by M’Quhae backed his version of events, but itwas clear from the outset that there was some difference of opinion on details.The magazine Zoologist published an extract from the journal of the watchofficer, Lieutenant Edgar Drummond, covering the day of the sighting. Drummondhad judged the head to be about ten feet long – rather large for a sixteen-inchneck to support. He estimated the visible part of the body at about twenty feetlong, and although he mentioned that the captain claimed to see another twentyfeet of tail just beneath the surface, this still came short of M’Quhae’sestimate of sixty feet of wave-cresting body. Drummond also disagreed about whathis captain referred to as a “mane” on the creature’s back, preferring todescribe it as some sort of dorsal fin.Few skeptics were rude enough to accuse the witnesses of being downright liars,but many hinted that this was their view. One wrote to the Times asking whyM’Quhae did not order his men to put about and give chase to the creature.Another, perhaps with tongue in cheek, demanded why he had not fired a broadsideat it.A more useful contribution to the discussion was a letter in the LiteraryGazette that pointed out that the description of the Daedalus monster wasremarkably like that of a sea serpent described by the Danish Bishop Pontoppidanin his influential zoological study, A Natural History of Norway (1753). Itcontinued: “One might fancy the gallant Captain had read the old Dane, and wascopying him, when he tells of the dark brown colour and white about the throat,and the neck clothed as if by a horse’s mane or a bunch of sea-weed, the exactwords of the historian”. Through all this M’Quhae maintained a dignifiedsilence. It took the intervention of one of Europe’s leading men of science topersuade him to comment.Sir Richard Owen, curator of the Hunterian Museum, an anatomist, naturalist, andpaleontologist of immense reputation, came forward to lead the crusade ofDaedalus sea-serpent debunkers. Owen was considered by many people to be thegreatest living authority on zoology. Pugnaciously conservative, he would laterbecome Darwin’s most bitter and most venomous opponent.Owen began by sending the Times a copy of a lengthy letter he had written to afriend who had inquired whether the Daedalus sea serpent might not be a survivalof the Saurian age – one of the most popular theories that had emerged duringthe controversy. Owen dismissed M’Quhae’s suggestion that the creature was agiant sea snake, implying that the captain should leave scientific deductions tothe experts. After a careful consideration of M’Quhae’s statement, Owen came tothe conclusion that the creature was almost certainly a mammal of some sort, and– since his analysis was based on the preconceived idea that the sighting was ofsome species already known to science – he went on to suggest one that might fitthe bill: the Phoca proboscidea or sea elephant. (The level of Owen’s expertiseon sea serpents may be judged from his remark that alligators are oftenencountered by vessels at sea; in fact, alligators are relatively weak swimmersand cannot even live in turbulent stretches of river.)The sea elephant is, in fact, an enormous seal (it may grow to twenty feet inlength) that is native to the seas around Antarctica. Owen’s suggestion was thatone of these creatures might have been swept north on an iceberg, from which itwould swim periodically to eat fish. When the ice melted, it would have beenforced to swim until its strength gave out. Perhaps, he wrote, it was dying whenthe Daedalus encountered it, thus explaining its lack of interest in them. Inhis opinion, what M’Quhae had mistaken as a forty-foot stretch of semisubmergedreptilian body was, in fact, the turbulence its horizontal tail made as it swamalong in a straight line. The “mane” that the captain noted was, Owen pointedout, typical of bull sea elephants – also known as Anderson’s sea lions. He thenwent on to deny the existence of all sea serpents on the grounds that sciencehad found no evidence of them and concluded with the assertion: “A larger bodyof evidence from eye-witnesses might be got together in proof of ghosts than ofsea-serpents”.In a letter to the Times M’Quhae replied, a little testily, that the creatureseen that day had not been a sea elephant, which he would have quicklyrecognized, or for that matter a seal of any kind. As an experienced sailor hewas quite capable of telling the difference between water turbulence and thepassage of a large, solid body. He also insisted that he had not heard of theaccount of a sea serpent given by Bishop Pontoppidan until it had been mentionedby the Literary Gazette correspondent and that therefore it could not haveinfluenced him to embroider the account of what he had seen.Finally, he ended by stating categorically that there had been no hystericalexcitement among the witnesses and that he himself was certain that no kind ofoptical illusion could have misled them about the details given in the report.His statement, he concluded, would stand as it was “until some more fortunateopportunity shall occur of making a closer acquaintance with the ‘great unknown’– in the present instance assuredly no ghost”. The letter was his final word onthe controversy, and its general tone was one of a man sick to death of thewhole subject.Ten years after the Daedalus sighting, a Captain Frederic Smith wrote to theTimes describing how his lookout on the Pekin had sighted what they took to be asea serpent with a “huge head and neck, covered with a long shaggy-looking kindof mane”, but that had proved to be a twenty-foot length of seaweed. The letterended by concluding that the Daedalus serpent was almost certainly a piece ofseaweed as well. This drew a reply from an officer of the Daedalus in which hestated that the “serpent” was “beyond all question a living animal, movingrapidly through the water”. He went on to describe how they had observed it atclose quarters for some time. Again, the circumstantial details of the reportare impressive.At least the British Admiralty indicated their belated support for M’Quhae’sstory by placing his report in their official records, the first such claimedsighting to be dignified in this way.In fact, there had been dozens of sightings of sea serpents before 1848 –Bernard Huevelmans’s book In the Wake of the Sea Serpents (1968) lists about 150between 1639 and 1848. The 1639 sighting is secondhand, but there are dozens ofother reports that are as circumstantial as M’Quhae’s. For example, CaptainGeorge Little, of the frigate Boston, described how, in May 1740, he was lyingin Broad Bay, off Maine, when “I discovered a large Serpent or monster comingdown the Bay, on the surface of the water”. A cutter full of armed men went offto take a closer look, but “when within a hundred feet . . . the serpent dove.He was not less than from 45 to 50 feet in length; the largest diameter of hisbody, I should judge, 15 inches; his head nearly the size of a man, which hecarried four or five feet above the water. He wore every appearance of a commonblack snake”.Huevelmans quotes 587 sightings between 1639 and 1966. One of the 1966 sightingswas made by two Englishmen, John Ridgeway and Chay Blyth. Ridgeway wrote in AFighting Chance:> I was shocked to full wakefulness by a swishing noise to starboard. I looked> out into the water and suddenly saw the writhing, twisting shape of a great> creature. It was outlined by the phosphorescence in the sea as if a string of> neon lights were hanging from it. It was an enormous size, some thirty-five> feet or more long, and it came towards me quite fast. . . . It headed straight> at me and disappeared right beneath me. . . . I was frozen with terror at this> apparition.> > And Huevelmans concludes his chapter – and his sightings – with a report by twovacationers near Skegness in eastern England, who saw “something like the LochNess monster” a hundred yards out to sea: “It had a head like a serpent and sixor seven pointed humps trailing behind”.Huevelmans goes on to quote Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as saying that if one okapihad been shot in Africa, its existence might be doubted. If ten men shoot anokapi, the evidence would be strong. If fifty men shoot one, “it would becomeconvincing”. So 587 sightings – even if some are dismissed as fraud or genuinemistakes – undoubtedly deserve to be classified as convincing. Huevelmans thenanalyses the sightings and classifies them into seven basic types: the“super-otter”, with a flat head and long, otterlike body; the many-humpedserpent, with its row of regular humps; the many-finned serpent, with pointedprojections along both sides; the merhorse, a creature with a mane; thelong-necked serpent, with a long, slender neck like a prehistoric diplodocus;and the “super-eels”, which resemble giant snakes. He toys with a classificationcalled the “Father-of-all-the-turtles” – looking, as one might suppose, like agiant turtle – but finally dismisses it as suspect and doubtful. The first fivehe believes to be mammals, while the super-eel – on the evidence of bodyfragments – seems to be a fish.Bishop Pontoppidan, whom we have already encountered, was not the first todescribe the sea serpent. As early as 1539 a Swedish bishop named Olaf Mansson(Latinized as Olaus Magnus) published in Venice a map of the north that clearlyshowed two sea serpents. And in a History of the Goths, Swedes, and Vandals,published in 1555, he describes a “serpent 200 feet long and 20 feet thick” thatlives in the sea caves off Bergen. This story, accompanied by terrifyingpictures of serpents devouring ships, was cited by many subsequentencyclopedists. Two hundred years later Bishop Pontoppidan devoted a chapter ofhis Natural History of Norway to various monsters, including the sea serpent,the kraken, and the mermaid. In the case of the sea serpent he took the troubleto obtain a firsthand account by one Captain Lorenz von Ferry, who ordered aboat to pursue the creature, and was able to describe in some detail thehorselike head with a white mane and black eyes, and the many coils or folds –he thought there were seven or eight, with about a fathom (six feet) betweeneach fold.The main interest of Pontoppidan’s comments at this juncture is that his bookaroused considerable skepticism in Britain when it was translated in 1765 andthat a Captain (later Admiral) Charles Douglas, who tried to find out what hecould about such monsters, took a distinctly skeptical view of the evidence ofsome witnesses. Oddly enough, he recorded that while many Norwegians believed inthe existence of “Stoor worms” (sea worms), they were inclined to dismiss thekraken, a giant octopus, as a myth. And it continued to be dismissed as a mythuntil its existence was finally accepted by science in the 1970s. The legends ofthe kraken – a vast octopoid monster that sometimes attacked swimmers, ships,and even coastal villages – can be traced back as far as the ancient Romanscholar Pliny, who described a “polyp” with thirty-foot-long arms that climbedashore to steal fish being salted at Carteia in Spain and that was killed onlyafter a violent encounter. Yet it should be noted that just about every seagoingculture in the world has had its equivalent of the kraken myth.By comparison, Bishop Pontoppidan’s kraken seemed relatively harmless. He notesthat local fishermen had discovered that there was a certain place off the coastof Norway where the recorded depth of eighty to one hundred fathoms would attimes diminish to twenty or thirty fathoms, and that during these times the seaaround would become turbid and muddy and the fishing in the area spectacularlyabundant. This, they believed, was due to the kraken, a vast tentacled beast amile and a half in circumference, which swam up from the seabed and attractedthe fish by venting its excrement. The monster posed no danger to men providedthey removed their boats from the area before it came to the surface. Thiskraken seemed to be curiously passive – it looked like a group of surfacingislands interconnected by a weedlike substance and surrounded by waving “horns”,some “as high and as large as the masts of middle-siz’d vessels”. After eatingits fill of the fish “beached” on its immense bulk, it would sink to the bottomagain.By the end of the eighteenth century science had dismissed such creatures asmythical. But the large number of nineteenth-century sightings of sea serpentsoff the coast of America began to erode the skepticism, while huge sucker marksfound on sperm whales, and fragments of enormous tentacles found in theirstomachs, made it clear that the giant squid was no myth either.In November 1861 crewmen on the French gunboat Alecton saw a giant squid nearTenerife and tried to harpoon it. The creature was clearly dying, since theywere able to slip a noose around it; but it broke in two as they tried to heaveit aboard. The squid was about twenty-four feet long, and the mouth measuredeighteen inches across. The Alecton arrived at Tenerife with enough of themonster to leave no possible doubt of its existence, and an account of it wasread before the French Academy of Sciences on 30, December 1861. Yet a zoologistnamed Arthur Mangin still expressed disbelief and wanted to know why thecreature had not simply dove below the surface. It was more likely, he thought,that everybody concerned in the report was a liar.But in the 1870s so many giant squids expired on the beaches of Newfoundland andLabrador that it became impossible to doubt their existence. And in 1896 anenormous though mutilated corpse was washed up on the beach in St. Augustine,Florida, and photographed and examined by Dr DeWitt Webb. It took four horses,six men, and a block and tackle to move the six- or seven- ton bulk farther upthe beach. The experts decided that it was a dead whale. But seventy-five yearslater, scientific examination of the few pieces that had been preserveddemonstrated that it was a giant octopus (not a squid) that must have been about200 feet across – big enough that its bulk would have occupied most of PicadillyCircus or Times Square.Fortunately, actual encounters with such monsters have been rare. But some ofthe most vivid accounts date from the Second World War. On 25, March 1941 in aremote part of the South Atlantic, the Allied vessel Britannia was attacked by aGerman raider flying the Japanese flag. The Germans fired on the vessel untilshe was ablaze, then gave the crew five minutes to abandon ship before they sankher. Because the Britannia had an insufficient number of lifeboats, many of thecrew found themselves clinging to fragile rubber rafts in the open ocean,hundreds of miles from land and well off the normal shipping lanes. One of thesewas overloaded with twelve exhausted men, among whom were Lieutenants Rolandsonand Davidson of the Royal Navy and Lieutenant R. E. Grimani Cox of the IndianArmy, who survived to give an account of their experiences.They had no food or water and no shelter from the sun. To avoid swamping theraft they had to take turns hanging precariously from its sides, where they hadno defense against the attacks of Portuguese men-of-war, which Cox laterdescribed as “stinging like a million bees”. By the second day some of the menhad become delirious; on the third the sharks started to close in. For threedays the wounded and thirst-maddened survivors were picked off one by one. Then,to the sailors’ joy, the circling sharks suddenly disappeared.One of the survivors gazed into the ocean depths and saw, to his horror, a hugeshape surfacing beneath them. An enormous tentacled creature surfaced besidethem and flailed its “arms” over the raft. It grabbed an Indian sailor, “hugginghim like a bear”, and dragged him into the sea. Satisfied with its prey it movedoff but later renewed its attack. Lieutenant Cox’s arm was badly mauled by agrasping tentacle, but this time the sailors managed to fight it off. Severaldays later Cox, Rolandson, and Davidson, the only survivors of the originaltwelve, were rescued by a Spanish ship.When, in 1943, Cox was examined by the British biologist, Dr John L.Cloudsley-Thompson, the latter observed a number of circular scars on Cox’s armshowing that disks of skin and flesh, each measuring about one and a quarterinches in diameter, had at some time been savagely gouged out of it. InCloudsley-Thompson’s opinion the injuries closely resembled those made by theserrated suckers of a squid; and from their size he deduced that the squid inquestion would have had to have been approximately twenty-three feet long.Richard Owen and his fellow skeptics would have regarded this as a monster ofunprecedented proportions, but the only surprise for Cloudsley-Thompson was thata giant squid so “small” could abduct a full-grown man.Another account of a giant squid also dates from the war years. J. D. Starkeydescribes how he would lower a cluster of electric bulbs over the side of anAdmiralty trawler to attract fish, which could then be easily caught. One nightin the Indian Ocean he found himself gazing at a “green unwinking eye”. Shininga powerful torch into the water, Starkey saw tentacles two feet thick. He walkedthe length of the ship, studying the monster, with its parrotlike beak, andrealized that it had to be more than 175 feet long. The squid remained there forabout fifteen minutes; then “as its valve opened fully . . . without any visibleeffort it zoomed into the night”.The major problem, as far as science is concerned, is that it seems virtuallyimpossible to study sea monsters in their natural habitat. Like the notoriousLoch Ness monster, they seem oddly shy. One student of “lake monsters”, the lateTed Holiday, even came to believe that some of them must be regarded asparanormal phenomena – a conclusion he reached because of his observation thatsome of the lakes in which monsters have been observed are too small to supporta large creature. Holiday’s encounters with the Loch Ness monster also developedin him a conviction that it seemed to have a sixth sense about when it couldshow itself without danger of being photographed.Another “monster watcher” – Tony “Doc” Shiels – reached a similar conclusion. In1975 and 1976 there were many sightings of a sea monster off Falmouth, inCornwall; it was christened “Morgawr”, meaning “Cornish giant”. Shiels succeededin taking an excellent photograph of Morgawr, which had the same“plesiosaur-like” shape as the Loch Ness monster – a long neck and a bulky bodywith “humps” on the back. Shiels subsequently went to Loch Ness and immediatelysucceeded in snapping two photographs of the monster. But his book Monstrum,subtitled A Wisard’s Tale, makes it clear that he believes that his ownmonster-sightings have involved some kind of encounter with the world of theparanormal.This need not imply that creatures like Morgawr and “Nessie” are ghosts, asHoliday was at one point inclined to believe. It may merely imply that theypossess highly developed telepathic powers that have enabled them, thus far, toavoid the monster-hunters with considerable success. Which in turn may implythat those who wish to study them must also possess such powers.The mystery of the underwater monsters is still far from solved. But at leastthere is now enough evidence to make it clear that Olaus Magnus and BishopPontoppidan deserve an apology."},{"pageContent":"51 Who Was Shakespeare?Early in 1616, a respectable middle-class gentleman of Stratford-upon-Avondecided it was time to make his will; a few months later in April he died,apparently after a drinking bout with two old friends from London, theplaywrights Ben Jonson and Michael Drayton. And then, for a considerable time,he was more or less forgotten. Within seven years of his death, a monument waserected to him in the parish church. In 1656 the antiquary Sir William Dugdale,who was interested in coats of arms, reproduced an inaccurate sketch of it inhis Antiquities of Warwickshire. It showed a gentleman with a droopingmoustache, whose hands rested on a woolsack – a symbol of trade. Few people inStratford seemed to be aware that this mournful-looking tradesman was a famousactor-playwright who had performed before Queen Elizabeth.More than a century later, in the 1770s, a clergyman named James Wilmot retiredto his native Warwickshire, and devoted his declining years to the study of histwo favourite writers, Francis Bacon and William Shakespeare. Since the villageof which he was now the rector – Barton-on-the-Heath – was only half a dozenmiles from Stratford, he began making inquiries to find out if any stories andtraditions of the great actor-playwright now survived in his native town.Apparently no one knew of any. But from the study of Shakespeare’s plays, Wilmothad concluded that he must have been a man of wide learning, and must thereforehave possessed a considerable library. Over the course of many years he madediligent inquiries in the area, investigating small private libraries for fiftymiles around. He found nothing whatever – not a single volume that might havebelonged to Shakespeare. And finally he was struck by an astonishing conviction:that the man called Shakespeare was not the author of the plays attributed tohim. The man who possessed all the qualifications for writing them was his otherfavourite author, Francis Bacon.Wilmot was apparently so overwhelmed by this realization – for by this time,Shakespeare was becoming recognized as one of the greatest of Englishplaywrights – that he decided to keep his strange convictions to himself. Butalmost thirty years later, when he was eighty, some of his caution hadevaporated. And when he was visited by an Ipswich Quaker in 1803 Wilmot finallyrevealed his embarrassing secret. The Quaker, James Cowell, was researchingShakespeare’s life because he had agreed to read a paper about him to his localphilosophical society, and no standard biography had yet been published. Cowellwas shaken, but more than half convinced. Two years later he read his paper onShakespeare, and told his astonished fellow-townsmen about the remarkable oldvicar and his alarming theories. The Ipswich philosophers were apparently“thrown into confusion”. Perhaps Wilmot heard about their reaction; at allevents, he left instructions in his will that all his Shakespeare papers shouldbe burnt, and this was duly carried out. And Cowell’s lecture lay undiscovereduntil more than a century later, when an eminent Shakespearian scholar describedWilmot in The Times Literary Supplement as “The first Baconian”.23[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2238474] ProfessorAllardyce Nicoll did not intend it as a compliment, for he regarded theproponents of the Baconian theory of Shakespeare’s authorship as cranks.And why should anyone reach such an apparently eccentric conclusion? Why shouldthe gentleman of Stratford-upon-Avon not be the author of Hamlet and Lear, justas most people assumed he was? In fact the notion is not quite as absurd as itsounds. The most baffling thing about Shakespeare is the lack of actualconnection between the “gentleman of Stratford” and the author of the plays.Shakespeare went to London in his twenties; within a few years he was asuccessful actor and playwright, and by the time he reached his mid-thirties (in1601) he was one of the most popular writers of the time. The author ofCoriolanus and The Tempest must have known he possessed genius – he says as muchin sonnet 55, beginning:> > Not marble, nor the gilded monuments> > > > Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rime.> > > > And when he returned to Stratford in his mid-forties he had become a wealthy manthrough the use of his talents. Is it conceivable that he did not even bother totake a single printed copy of any of his works with him – there were many extant– and that he even left behind in London the library he must have accumulatedover the years? Of course, he may have done so – but in that case, what happenedto them? Why are they not mentioned in his will?Shakespeare scholars reply that in Elizabethan times acting was not regarded asa particularly respectable profession – hardly more so than pimping – and thatShakespeare may have preferred to keep it to himself. This is true. But writers,then as now, were regarded as a cut above most other professions, andShakespeare was also the author of the sonnets, The Rape of Lucrece and Venusand Adonis. The sonnets appeared in 1609, two years before he retired toStratford – surely he would have taken a few copies with him to distribute tohis friends and family? Surely he would have made sure that copies of his workswent to his beloved daughter Susanna to whom he left most of his estate in thewill, and to her husband, the distinguished physician Dr John Hall, who waslater to refuse a knighthood from Charles I? Again, the scholars reply that hemay well have done so, and that Shakespeare’s books simply vanished over thenext fifty years or so – by which time admirers were beginning to show aninterest in the playwright. It could be true, but it sounds somehow unlikely.The Rev. Wilmot had another reason for doubting that the gentleman of Stratfordwrote the plays. They seem to reveal a man of wide learning and experience: aknowledge of medicine, law, botany and foreign countries, as well as of courtlife. Where would a butcher’s son from Stratford have the opportunity of gainingsuch knowledge? Francis Bacon, on the other hand – philosopher, essayist andLord Chancellor – was known as one of the most erudite men of his time. . . .For Wilmot one of the main problems was that Shakespeare’s reputation hadincreased so much since his death that it was difficult to sort out the truthfrom the later legends. Until 1660 – when the theatres opened again after thePuritan interregnum – he remained half forgotten (although his collected playshad appeared in 1623). There was a Shakespeare revival during the Restoration,but his plays were “adapted” and almost totally rewritten. John Aubrey’s BriefLives (1682) has an extremely “brief” life of Shakespeare – a mere two pages –in which he says that Shakespeare was a butcher’s son, and that he would makedramatic speeches when he had to kill a calf. By that time the Stratford vicarJohn Ward had noted in his diaries (1661–3) the legend about Shakespeare dyingafter a drinking bout with Jonson and Drayton. By 1670 Shakespeare’s reputationwith the playgoing public was as high as it had been in 1600, and unscrupulousbooksellers were getting rid of all kinds of old plays by declaring they were byShakespeare. The “Shakespeare boom” was largely the work of Sir WilliamDavenant, who was reputed to be Shakespeare’s godson – perhaps his son – and whodevoted much of his life to reviving the reputation of his idol. The first Lifeof Shakespeare appeared in 1709, as the introduction to Nicholas Rowe’ssix-volume edition of Shakespeare; Rowe obtained much of his information fromthe actor Thomas Betterton, another worshipper of the bard, who had made apilgrimage to Stratford to collect stories and traditions in about 1708. It wasRowe who first printed the story about how Shakespeare fled from Stratford afterbeing caught poaching the deer of Sir Thomas Lucy. From then on the legendsmultiplied: stories of carousing in Warwickshire villages – notably “drunkenBidford” – of rhymes about fellow-townsmen, of holding horses’ heads outside thetheatre when he first came to London, of his love affairs, his appearancesbefore Queen Elizabeth and King James, and dozens more. In 1769 Shakespeare wasnow regarded with such reverence that the burghers of Stratford decided to holdbicentenary celebrations, and asked the famous actor David Garrick to takecharge of the Jubilee. (They were, in fact, five years too late – Shakespearewas born in 1564 – but no one seemed to mind this.) Shakespeare had alreadybecome a source of income to the tradesmen of Stratford. Rain spoiled thecelebrations, and Garrick lost a small fortune; nevertheless, the Jubilee may besaid to have established the “Shakespeare Industry” as Stratford’s chief sourceof income.But in the same year, 1769, Herbert Lawrence, a friend of Garrick’s, publishedan amusing allegory called The Life and Adventures of Common Sense whichdescribes how a plausible rogue and habitual thief named Shakespeare stole someof the attributes of Wisdom, Genius and Humour and used them to write plays. Itwas not meant to be a serious accusation, but it seemed to demonstrate a mildlysatirical attitude to the Shakespeare Industry. Soon after this the Rev. JamesWilmot moved to Barton-on-the-Heath and began those researches that led him toconclude that Shakespeare’s real name was Francis Bacon. But when the QuakerJames Cowell imparted these conclusions to the Ipswich Philosophical Society in1803 he swore them to silence about the name of their author, and they seem tohave kept their word.The absurd episode of the Ireland forgeries demonstrates the extent to which“Bardolatry” (as Shaw was to call it) had gained a foothold by the 1790s. SamuelIreland, a prosperous author of travel books, worshipped Shakespeare, andallowed various tradesmen of Stratford to sell him a large number of Shakespearerelics, including a goblet carved from the mulberry tree planted inShakespeare’s garden and the chair on which Shakespeare sat in his courtingdays. Ireland’s youngest son William craved his father’s affection, and beganforging small Shakespeare items, such as a mortgage deed. His father’s greed ledhim finally to forge whole Shakespeare plays which for a while fooled manyexperts. The bubble finally burst in 1796, when Ireland’s play Vortigern waspresented at Drury Lane; at the line: “And when this solemn mockery is ended”the audience burst into boos and jeers. When William finally confessed to theforgeries his father flatly refused to believe him, remaining convinced thatsuch “works of genius” were beyond the powers of his untalented son. In theprevious century there had been a far more sensible and balanced attitude –Samuel Pepys thought Twelfth Night “but a silly play” and A Midsummer Night’sDream “the most insipid, ridiculous play that I ever saw in my life”. By themid-nineteenth century, Shakespeare was regarded as a godlike genius whosefeeblest lines were regarded as beyond criticism. Matthew Arnold expressed thisattitude of mindless worship in a sonnet that began:> > Others abide our question. Thou art free.> > > > We ask and ask: Thou smilest and art still,> > > > Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill> > > > That to the stars uncrowns his majesty . . . etc.> > > > It was probably this kind of uncritical veneration that lay at the root of thevarious heresies that began to spring up in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1848the American consul at Vera Cruz, Joseph C. Hart, wrote a book on The Romance ofYachting in which he paused to reflect: “Ah, Shakespeare – Immortal Bard – whowere you”? And in the next thirty-five pages, Hart digresses from yachting tosuggest the theory that the Stratford actor was merely a hack who inserted bawdylines into plays that had been written by starving poets. In 1857 William HenrySmith published Bacon and Shakespeare in which he pointed out that nothing weknow about Shakespeare indicates that he could be the author of the plays, whileBacon had all the necessary qualifications.He had already been anticipated by a brilliant and attractive American lady,Delia Bacon, who had started life as a schoolteacher, then become an author andlecturer. Her special subjects were history and literature, and her study ofShakespeare convinced her – for the reasons we have already discussed – that theretired actor of Stratford was an unlikely author for the plays. She becameconvinced that the evidence for Bacon’s authorship lay in England, probably inthe tomb itself. She gained the support of that eminent Bostonian Ralph WaldoEmerson, and of a New York banker who admired Bacon, Charles Butler. She sailedfor England in the spring of 1853, armed with an introduction to Carlyle fromEmerson. Carlyle took to her at once and gave her support; so did NathanielHawthorne, who was American consul in Liverpool. She spent three years living inlodgings and writing her book to prove that Bacon was Shakespeare. Thepublishers Chapman and Hall sent her a rejection note declining to have any partin “an attack on one of the most sacred beliefs of the nation and indeed of allnations” – a phrase that expresses the almost religious bigotry that had becometypical of the British attitude to Shakespeare. In 1856 she moved to Stratfordand charmed the clerk of the church into allowing her to spend some time lockedalone in the church; but at the last minute her nerve failed her – or perhapsshe was merely demoralized at the thought of trying to rip up the floor of thechurch and dig down seventeen feet, the reputed depth of the grave.In 1857, Delia Bacon finally brought out her Philosophy of the Plays ofShakespeare Unfolded. (Hawthorne, with whom she had quarrelled, paid for it.)But it proved to be a confused and confusing book – it is not even clear whetherher “suspect” is Bacon, Raleigh, Spenser, Sidney or the Earl of Oxford. Her mainthesis was obviously absurd – that a group of enlightened scholars concocted theplays, using the Stratford actor as a “front”, in order to express convictionsthat might otherwise have led to imprisonment and torture. Reviewers wereunderstandably scathing. After so many years of effort, Delia was shattered, andher mind gave way soon after. A nephew found her in a lunatic asylum, and tookher back to New England, where she died at the age of forty-eight.Delia Bacon’s success was greater than she lived to realize; she had raised thequestion of Shakespeare’s authorship, and now many others took it up, includingEmerson, Whitman, Oliver Wendell Holmes and Henry James senior. In England theprime minister, Lord Palmerston, read William Henry Smith’s book and became aBaconian.In 1867 there came to light one of the most interesting and convincing pieces ofevidence connecting Bacon and Shakespeare. A librarian commissioned by the Dukeof Northumberland to examine manuscripts in Northumberland House came upon afolio volume consisting of twenty-two sheets folded double. It seemed clear thatit had belonged to Francis Bacon – at least, it contained mostly copies of workswritten by him. Nine pieces remained in the folder, and there were probablymore. The cover, headed “Mr ffrauncis Bacon”, also has the word “Nevill” writtentwice at the top. Just below this are the words “Ne vele velis”, the familymotto of Bacon’s nephew Sir Henry Nevill. The script contains two different setsof handwriting, probably those of amanuenses – presumably Bacon’s. The covercontains a list which seems to be a table of contents – since it mentions anumber of pieces which are actually in the folder, such as four essays by Bacon,“Philipp against monsieur” – a letter from Sir Philip Sidney dissuading theQueen from marrying the Duke of Anjou, “Speeches for Lord Essex at the tylt” –speeches by Bacon written for the Earl of Essex, and “Loycester’s Common Wealth”– an incomplete copy of Leicester’s Commonwealth. But the cover also lists itemsthat were no longer in the folio, including Nashe’s banned play The Isle ofDogs, and “Richard the Second” and “Richard the Third”. And immediately abovethese Shakespeare titles: “By Mr ffrauncis William Shakespeare”.In fact this evidence is less powerful than it looks at first. “Richard theSecond”, while not actually banned, was something of a “sensitive” play, andShakespeare had been obliged to omit some lines from the first quarto edition of1597 (which is also the likeliest date for the Northumberland manuscript). WhenEssex rebelled in 1601 he paid for a special performance of Richard II, hopingthat a play about a king who was deposed might inspire Londoners to join hisinsurrection. (It was unsuccessful, and he was executed.) The “sensitive” linesabout deposition were restored in an edition after Queen Elizabeth’s death.Richard III was about the same sensitive subject, and may also have beenregarded as dubious. As a Privy Councillor of the queen, and her legal adviser,it was Bacon’s job to study “sensitive” works – he had also read a work by DrHayward on Richard II which had “much incensed Queen Elizabeth”; Dr Hayward wascommitted to the Tower for treason, but Bacon told the queen the book washarmless.So we may assume that the Northumberland folder originally contained several“banned” works on which Bacon had been asked to give an opinion. A closer lookat the cover shows that the name “Mr ffrauncis Bacon” and “Mr ffrauncis” hasbeen doodled several times perhaps by Bacon himself; Shakespeare’s name has alsobeen doodled repeatedly. But a close examination of the manuscript shows that itis quite untrue to claim that someone has doodled “Mr ffrauncis WilliamShakespeare”. “ffrauncis” and “William Shakespeare” are on different levels, andthe surname Bacon is written directly below “Mr ffrauncis” (with the phrase“your sovereign” written upside down between them). “William Shakespeare” iswritten directly above the titles of his two plays and obviously refers to them.So, regretfully, the Northumberland MS must be abandoned as a proof that therewas a closer connection between Bacon and Shakespeare than is generallysupposed; all it proves is that Bacon had read Richard II and Richard III in thecourse of his duties as the queen’s adviser.Thirty-one years after Delia Bacon’s book there appeared the most influential ofall the works of the “Shakespeare heretics”, Ignatius Donnelly’s The GreatCryptogram, Francis Bacon’s Cipher in the So-called Shakespeare Plays. Donnellywas an American congressman, famous for Atlantis: the Antediluvian World, whichis still regarded as a sourcebook by those who believe in the existence ofPlato’s sunken continent. But in the vast two-volume work on Bacon he tried toprove that Bacon had hidden ciphers about himself in the plays of Shakespeare,to prove his own authorship. (Bacon was in reality fascinated by ciphers.) Afteryears of studying the plays and trying out every possible key to the cipher hefinally began to perceive such obscure messages as: “Seas ill said that More lowor Shak’st spur never writ a word of them”, meaning, according to Donnelly:“Cecil said that Marlowe or Shakespeare never writ a word of them.” The bookinspired thousands of cranks to seek for “ciphers” in Shakespeare and otherfamous authors, and provoked a few wits and satirists to demonstrate that almostany sentence can be rearranged to produce astonishing messages – Ronald Knoxwrote a delightful essay proving by this method that Queen Victoria was the realauthor of In Memoriam, describing herself, for example, as “Alf’s pen-poet”.Another Baconian who was convinced that Bacon concealed his identity undervarious ciphers and anagrams was Dr Orville W. Owen of Detroit, who finallyextracted a long message in blank verse from the plays, and found that itordered him to cut up all the works of Bacon and Shakespeare into separate pagesand stick them around the outside of a wheel. Owen used two wheels, and athousand-foot strip of canvas that passed around them, with the pages stuck onto it. By incredibly complex reasoning, he extracted more codes from thisdismembered text, and used it to extract the information that Bacon was reallythe son of Queen Elizabeth and her lover the Earl of Leicester; Hamlet waswritten as a personal attack on his mother, who retaliated by sending Bacon toexile in France. . . . The cipher also revealed that the Queen had finally beenstrangled by her chief minister Robert Cecil. The deciphered material alsoinformed Owen that Bacon had concealed vital manuscripts proving his authorshipin various boxes hidden near a castle at the confluence of the rivers Severn andWye. Owen and a band of faithful followers spent fifteen years searching thecountryside in the region of Chepstow (where there is a ruined castle). They dugdozens of holes and tunnels around the castle, and even under the river Wye, buteventually had to admit defeat. Another party hired boatmen to take them up anddown the river, looking for hidden flights of steps that might lead to secretchambers. To the armchair student of human eccentricity, it all soundsmarvellously funny; but the people who wasted their fortunes and their lives onthis wild-goose chase must have felt that it was closer to tragedy.In fact, anyone who takes the trouble to read a biography of Francis Bacon willsee why it is impossible that he could have written Shakespeare’s plays. Theircharacters are utterly different. The author of A Midsummer Night’s Dream andTwelfth Night is obviously a kindly and good-natured human being; it is easy tounderstand why his friends referred to him as “gentle Shakespeare”. No one wouldhave called Bacon gentle. He was a man of immense intelligence who waspermanently dissatisfied with himself and with his lot in life. He was driven bythe most superficial kind of ambition: “political power is what I want, powerover men and affairs”. He was a calculating, rather heartless man who believedthat successful men should learn how to “work” their friends by discoveringtheir weaknesses. His father died before he had time to make provision for himin his will, and Bacon found himself practically penniless at the age ofnineteen. His uncle Lord Burghley (William Cecil) was Lord Treasurer, and couldeasily have procured his nephew advancement; but he preferred to help his sonRobert. Bacon became a lawyer. Then he decided to pay court to the Queen’sfavourite, the accomplished and dashing Earl of Essex; with charm and flatteryhe had soon gained the earl’s friendship. Essex frequently gave him money –Bacon was a spendthrift – and tried hard to persuade the Queen to grant himvarious offices. When she passed over Bacon in favour of another candidate forMaster of the Rolls, Essex soothed his protégé’s disappointment by presentinghim with a large estate. In 1596 Essex captured Cadiz, and became one of themost popular men in England. But – to Bacon’s alarm – he began to overreachhimself. After an unsuccessful expedition against the Irish, Essex waspolitically ruined. He tried to foment a rebellion, and was arrested and put ontrial. Everyone recognized that he was guilty of hot temper rather than a desireto overthrow the Queen, and it seemed likely that his punishment would not beheavy. At this point Bacon betrayed his friend; he delivered a brilliant speechin which he accused Essex of treason, and declared that, “as a friend”, he knewEssex meant to seize the throne. Essex was sentenced to death and executed.It is impossible to exonerate Bacon. He did it to gain favour with the Queen andfurther his own career; in return for sending Essex to his death he receivedtwelve hundred pounds. But not the advancement he hoped for. Elizabethdistrusted him.When Elizabeth died Bacon set out to flatter James I, and succeeded. He wasknighted, and became Attorney-General in 1613. Five years later he finallyreached the climax of his ambition, was ennobled and became Lord Chancellor.Three years later he was impeached for accepting bribes; he admitted his guiltand was banned from office and fined £40,000. He devoted the last five years ofhis life to writing.Bacon is a baffling character, a strange mixture of greatness and pettiness. Hewas the most intelligent man of his time, and in some ways one of the nastiest.It would be difficult to conceive a character more totally unlike Shakespeare’s.The dramatist had genius; yet in a sense was not particularly intelligent. Hewrote as naturally as a bird sings. The pessimism in which he frequentlyindulges is the pessimism of a child who has just lost a favourite toy, not thegloomy cynicism of the brilliant intellectual who despises his own craving forsuccess. It is as impossible that Bacon could have written Shakespeare as thatSchopenhauer could have written Alice in Wonderland.Bacon was only the first of many candidates. In 1891 an archivist named JamesGreenstreet wrote a series of articles in The Genealogist suggesting thatShakespeare was the Earl of Derby, William Stanley. In 1599 a Jesuit spy hadtold a correspondent on the continent that the earl was not available to takepart in a plot against the Queen because he was “busy in penning comedies forthe common players”. Greenstreet died soon after publishing the articles, butthe theory was revived fifteen years later by an American, Robert Frazer, in abook called The Silent Shakespeare. A later exponent of the theory, ProfessorAbel Lefranc, wrote four large volumes whose purpose was to prove thatShakespeare was thoroughly familiar with France and the French. He also pointedout that the plot of Measure for Measure was based on a real-life story fromParis in which there was a distinct similarity between the names of thecharacters and Shakespeare’s inventions.The dramatist Christopher Marlowe was another candidate, advanced in 1895 in anovel called It Was Marlowe by a San Francisco attorney, William G. Ziegler. Itwas not taken seriously, but the theory was revived in 1955 by an Americanscholar, Calvin Hoffman, in The Murder of the Man Who Was Shakespeare. Marlowebecame famous with his first play, Tamburlaine, in 1587, when he was onlytwenty-three, and he probably collabourated with Shakespeare on Henry VI. In1593 he was murdered in a quarrel about how much he owed towards a bill in atavern; his murderer was acquitted. At the time of his murder Marlowe was inserious trouble; his fellow-playwright Thomas Kyd had been charged with atheism,and alleged that the papers found in his room actually belonged to Marlowe. Kydwas tortured but released, and seems to have died not long after. Marlowe had apowerful protector, Sir Thomas Walsingham, the cousin of the queen’s spy-masterSir Francis Walsingham. At the time of his death he was due to stand trial, andmight well have been executed. Hoffman’s theory is that Marlowe was spiritedaway to Europe, and that another man was killed in his place and buried in hisgrave. And Marlowe went on to write the plays of Shakespeare. Hoffman’s chiefargument is that an analytical method invented by Dr Thomas Corwin Meadenhall –it involves noting the average length (in letters) of an author’s words –demonstrated that Bacon could not have written Shakespeare, but that Marlowecould.But once again a reading of the works of the two men reveals that they werequite different in character. One of the most basic differences was that Marlowewas homosexual, and Shakespeare was clearly not. The Shakespeare scholar Dr A.L.Rowse has pointed out that one major difference between the work of Marlowe andthat of Shakespeare is that Shakespeare is fond of bawdy jokes and sexual doubleentendres, while Marlowe’s work shows the prudery that is often characteristicof homosexuals – the distaste for crude smut. This observation leaves CalvinHoffman’s case with very little support.Around 1914 an elementary schoolmaster named John Thomas Looney (an unfortunatename, but pronounced Loney) became convinced that the Stratford actor could nothave written the plays, and began a systematic search for an Elizabethan whopossessed the right qualifications. He deduced the character of the author fromhis work, then made a list of the basic requirements of such a person: he endedwith a list of seventeen. By 1920 he had decided that only one man fitted thepicture: Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford. His book ShakespeareIdentified is generally agreed to be as absorbing as a detective story, but his“unfortunate name” prevented it being taken seriously by the general public.(Other writers on the Shakespeare problem included S.E. Silliman, who supportedMarlowe’s case, and George Battey, who believed Shakespeare was Daniel Defoe.)But although his book was soon forgotten, the theory was taken up by anotherAmerican scholar, Charlton Ogburn, whose huge tome The Mysterious WilliamShakespeare (1984) is, in spite of its size, immensely readable. But althoughOgburn argues convincingly that Oxford was a fine lyric poet who might well havewritten “Hark, hark the lark” and “Full fathom five”, he has an almostimpossible task convincing the reader that late plays like A Winter’s Tale, Learand The Tempest were written before 1604, the year Oxford died. Looney overcamethat problem by suggesting that these plays were written by other people –Raleigh being the author of The Tempest and Fletcher of Henry VIII; Ogburnargues vigorously that they were all written much earlier than supposed; but hisarguments will leave most people as unconvinced as Looney’s did.One of the minor problems of Shakespeare scholarship is the identity of the ladycalled Anne Whateley, to whom, according to an entry in the Bishop ofWorcester’s register, Shakespeare was due to be married in November 1582; alicence was issued to William Shakespeare just before his marriage to AnneHathaway. “Whateley” could have been a slip of the pen on the part of the clerk,but surely he would not have written “of Temple Grafton” when he should havewritten “Shottery”? Says Sir Sidney Lee: “He was doubtless another of thenumerous William Shakespeare’s who abounded in the diocese of Worcester”. Thisview is disputed by William Ross, a Scottish architect, who became convincedthat Anne was the true author of Shakespeare’s plays. In The Story of AnneWhateley and William Shaxpere (1939), Ross tells a touching story of how in 1581the seventeen-year-old Shakespeare, employed in his father’s business, called ata nunnery in Temple Grafton, near Stratford, and became acquainted with a nuncalled Anne Whateley, who fell in love with him. She began to write sonnets tohim, the first of which began “From fairest creatures we desire increase”. Butafter she had given him thirty-two sonnets, the youth confessed that he washaving a love affair with an older woman, Anne Hathaway, and in sonnet 33 shebecomes the “basest cloud” that hides the face of the sun. When Anne Hathawaybecame pregnant Shakespeare experienced revulsion, and persuaded Anne Whateleyto marry him; but the Hathaway family stepped in and took legal steps to force“Shaxpere” to marry Anne Hathaway. Anne is of course the “dark Lady”, for whomAnne Whateley began to experience a tormented, ambivalent kind of love. In fact,according to Ross, Anne Whateley eventually wrote about Shakespeare’s desertion– to London – from Anne Hathaway’s point of view, the result being A Lover’sComplaint, a triumph of identification of one woman with another.But how did a girl who had spent most of her life in a nunnery become such anexcellent craftsman? The answer, according to Ross, is that she was also thecollabourator of one of the major poets of the age, Edmund Spenser. Spenser metAnne Whateley about 1576, when Shakespeare was only twelve, and fell in lovewith her. Spenser’s first major poem, The Shephearde’s Calender, appeared threeyears later, and, according to Ross, “the surmise that she collabourated in itis not an improbable one”. And she then went on to write Spenser’s mostcelebrated work, The Faerie Queene. A few years later she also dashed offMarlowe’s Hero and Leander. In fact, “a perusal of the plays attributed toMarlowe makes it quite evident that their real author was Anne Whateley. Theseplays . . . were preliminary efforts, written when she was acquiring proficiencyin the technique of the theatre. Her full achievement as a creative artist wasreserved for Shakespeare alone.” The question of whether she was alsoresponsible for the bawdy passages is not explored, but we may probably assumethat these vulgar touches were added by the Stratford actor.The reader of Anne Whateley and William Shaxpere may experience a suddensuspicion that the author is pulling his leg, and that the book is intended as asatire on the whole anti-Shakespeare industry. This would be unfounded. WilliamRoss presented the present writer with a copy in 1963, when he wasseventy-three, and it was perfectly clear from his accompanying letter that hewas totally sincere, and that since publishing the book in 1939 he had beenworking assiduously on his theory and accumulating more evidence. And it wasalso clear that nothing would convince him that the different styles of TheFaerie Queene, Hero and Leander and King Lear indicate the presence of threedifferent authors.This seems to be the major problem with most of the anti-Shakespearians. Theyexamine the problem through a magnifying glass, and cannot see the wood for thetrees. And most of them are so lacking in any faculty of literary criticism thatthey cannot tell a good poem from a bad one. Most of them can be highlyconvincing for a few pages at a time, but the whole argument is always less thanthe sum of its parts. Neither Bacon nor Derby nor Oxford nor Marlowe nor evenAnne Whateley finally emerge as a more convincing candidate than the Stratfordactor.But what of the Stratford actor? It seems, to put it mildly, unlikely that a manwhose father was illiterate and whose children were illiterate, and who couldnot even be bothered to keep copies of his own books in the house, should havewritten Hamlet and Othello. We may reject all the other candidates as absurd;but at the end of the day we still find ourselves facing the same problems thatmade the Rev. James Wilmot conclude that, whoever wrote the plays and sonnets,it was not William Shakespeare."},{"pageContent":"52 The Skull of DoomThe Strange Tale of the Crystal Skull> For the past twenty years the weirdest gem in the world has belonged to a lady> who keeps it on a velvet cloth on a sideboard in her house. It is a fearsome> skull, weighing 11 pounds 7 ounces (5.19 kilograms), carved of pure quartz> crystal, and its owner believes it comes from a lost civilization. Its eyes> are prisms and it is said, the future appears in them. It has been called the> “skull of doom”.That passage from Arthur C. Clarke’s television series “Mysterious World” mayserve as an introduction to one of the most interesting mysteries of thetwentieth century. The skull belonged to an explorer and adventurer named Albert(“Mike”) Mitchell-Hedges, born in 1882. On his death in 1959 it passed into thepossession of his ward, Anna Mitchell-Hedges, born in 1910, who claimed to havediscovered it in a “lost city” in South America – the Mayan city of Lubaantun,in British Honduras. According to her own account: “I did see the skull first –or I saw something shining and called my father – it was his expedition, and weall helped to carefully move the stones. [Lubaantun means ‘place of fallenstones’.] I was let pick it up because I had seen it first”. It was found,apparently, underneath the altar in the ruins of a Mayan temple. The date shegives – 1924 – conflicts with an earlier account in which she is said to havediscovered it on her seventeenth birthday, which would have been three yearslater. What she found was the upper part of the skull; the jaw, she says, wasfound three months later under rubble twenty-five feet away.Mitchell-Hedges, according to Anna, felt that the skull belonged to the localIndians, descendants of the ancient Mayas, and he gave it to them. But when heprepared to leave for England in the rainy season of 1927, the grateful Indiansreturned it to him as a present for his kindness to them.The ancient Mayas are themselves something of a mystery. Their earliest historyseems to date back to 1500 BC, but their great “classic” period extends roughlyfrom AD 700 to 900. During this period they developed a high level ofcivilization, with writing, sophisticated mathematics, a calendar, andimpressive sculptures. Then, with startling suddenness, Mayan civilizationcollapsed – no one knows why. Disease and earthquakes have been suggested, yetthere is no evidence for either. Neither is there evidence of violence. It seemsthat the Mayas simply abandoned their cities and melted away into remote places.And their great civilization reverted to a far more primitive level. Theirpartially deciphered writings offer no clue to the mystery.Mitchell-Hedges believed that there was a connection between the Mayas and thelegendary continent of Atlantis, which is said to have vanished beneath thewaves of the Atlantic Ocean in prehistoric times. Another explorer, ColonelPercy Fawcett, believed that he had evidence that survivors from Atlantis hadreached South America and that the evidence lay in Brazil. Fawcett vanishedwithout a trace on an expedition to Brazil in 1924. Mitchell-Hedges believedthat the survivors had come ashore farther north, in the Yucatán Peninsula ofCentral America, and one of the objects of his expedition to Honduras was tolook for proof of this theory. He never found it, but he did find clues to thelost treasures of Sir Henry Morgan, a pirate who had captured Panama (withconsiderable brutality) in the seventeenth century.What, in fact, do we know about the “skull of doom”? Remarkably little. It ismade from a single block of rock crystal, or clear quartz. Mitchell-Hedgesdeclared that it was probably 3,600 years old, but that would take it back athousand years before the earliest date suggested for the Mayas. He alsosuggested that it must have taken 150 years to create, by the grinding andpolishing of rock with sand. In Chariots of the Gods? Erich von Däniken has(predictably) taken an even bolder line, explaining (mistakenly) that “nowhereon the skull is there a clue showing that a tool known to us was used!” andsuggesting that it was created by the “Ancient Astronauts” who (according to vonDäniken) built the Great Pyramid. A modern crystal expert, Frank Dorland, hassaid that he could make a similar skull in three years, but that would be withthe aid of modern technology.Inevitably, the experts are divided on the subject of the skull’s origin. Mostseem to agree that it was probably carved in Mexico, from rock crystal found inMexico or Calaveras County, California, and that it could have been manufacturedin the past five hundred years. But if that date is correct, then it runscounter to the claim of Mitchell-Hedges that it was found in a Mayan temple thathad been abandoned for a thousand years. The Aztecs – the likeliestmanufacturers of the skull – founded their capital, Tenochtitlan, around AD1325.Regrettably, this is also the view of practically everybody who has looked intothe matter. Mike Mitchell-Hedges was undoubtedly a very remarkable man, andAnna’s total devotion to him is understandable. When he met her in Toronto in1917, she was a seven-year-old orphan by the name of Anna Le Guillon and was inthe charge of some men who intended to put her into an orphanage.Mitchell-Hedges was touched by her plight and adopted her, a decision, as shelater said, that neither of them had reason to regret.But for all his kindness and erratic brilliance as an explorer, Mitchell-Hedgeswas not another Captain Scott or Colonel Fawcett; his character was altogethercloser to that of the swashbuckling Sir Henry Morgan. He was a man with a keensense of humor, and he enjoyed telling – and even printing – tongue in cheektall stories. His life of adventure was inspired by his childhood reading ofRider Haggard stories and Arthur Conan Doyle’s Lost World, and his own books –with titles like Land of Wonder and Fear and Battles with Giant Fish – reflectthe character of a man who was, in some respects, an overgrown schoolboy. He wasnot so much a liar as an Elizabethan adventurer born out of his time.It has been suggested that Mitchell-Hedges brought the crystal skull from Londonto Lubaantun and “planted” it under the altar for his adopted daughter to findon her seventeenth (or fourteenth) birthday, something of which he would havebeen perfectly capable.Yet his autobiography, Danger My Ally (1954), suggests that all was not asstraightforward as Anna’s account suggets. You would expect a man who had madesuch an important find to describe it in some detail; instead, he dismisses itin a few lines, explaining; “How the skull came into my possession I have reasonfor not revealing”. But why not, if Anna’s story about its discovery isaccurate? After all, it would reflect credit on his adopted daughter. He alsodescribes at length far less important artifacts he found in Lubaantun. Strangerstill, he has removed all reference to the skull from the American edition ofthe book. There can be only one reason for this: he does not want to be caughtin a lie but is still not willing to tell the truth.Anna Mitchell-Hedges stuck firmly to the Lubaantun story. Daily Expressjournalist Donald Seaman has described how he heard it directly from her ownlips. In 1962 Seaman, who was writing a book about espionage, came upon aphotograph of the recently convicted spy Gordon Lonsdale that showed him posingwith two middle-aged women. Careful research revealed that one of the women wasAnna Mitchell-Hedges. Curious to know what she was doing with a spy, Seamancontacted her at her home in Reading and went to see her, accompanied byphotographer Robert Girling.Anna Mitchell-Hedges proved to be a stout, formidable-looking woman in herfifties, and when they arrived she was still attired in her dressing gown. Thestory behind the photograph proved to be innocent enough; it had been taken at ahistoric castle, where she and her friend had fallen into conversation with theman who later proved to be at the centre of the Portland spy case; a passingcommercial photographer had snapped them, extracted payment from AnnaMitchell-Hedges, and later forwarded the photograph to her. She hadn’t seenLonsdale since that time.Perhaps feeling guilty that she had brought them to Reading on a wild goosechase, she asked them if they would like to see the “skull of doom”. Neither hadever heard of it, but they politely said yes. She asked them to follow her andled them to the master bedroom, where she groped around under the bed. Seaman,who was expecting to see an object the size of an egg, was surprised when shebrought out something that might have been a large cabbage, wrapped innewspapers. They accompanied her back to the sitting room, where she unwrappedit on the table.Both Seaman and Girling stared with amazement at the magnificent and bizarreobject that lay on the table. The life-size human skull seemed to be made ofpolished diamond – in the dim light it had a greenish hue, as if lit from theinside or from underneath. Its lower jaw moved like that of a human jaw, addinga gruesome touch of realism. They agreed later that neither had seen anything atonce so beautiful and so oddly disquieting. This, Anna Mitchell-Hedges toldthem, was the “skull of doom”, found in a Mayan temple in 1927. It had receivedits nickname from the local natives, who were convinced that it had magicalpowers and should be treated with the respect due to a supernatural being. Ithad become the focus of a number of legends about people who encounteredmisfortune after showing it insufficient respect.She went on to tell them that in 1927 her father had been looking for thetreasure buried by the pirate Henry Morgan in 1671. They had learned that in thearea of the Mayan city of Lubaantun, in British Honduras, natives had names likeHawkins and Morgan. Her father was also convinced that the remains of the lostcivilization of Atlantis were in the same area. But the skull was the onlyancient artifact he had found.Now that her father was dead (he died in 1959), Anna wanted to return toHonduras to look for the treasure, and in order to raise the money, she waswilling to sell the skull, as well as a drinking mug that had been presented toKing Charles II by Nell Gwyn (and that had been authenticated by scholars).“How much is the skull worth?” asked Seaman.“Probably about a quarter of a million”.“My God! Aren’t you afraid to keep it in the house?”“I think I could deal with any burglars”. Anna Mitchell-Hedges opened herdressing gown, and revealed a Colt 45 revolver strapped to her waist.There was some talk about the possibility of the Daily Express helping tofinance the expedition to Lubaantun and allowing Seaman to go along to report onit. To his great regret, the proposal was turned down by the editor. But DonaldSeaman has never forgotten that menacingly beautiful object that seemed to glowwith its own light.But, as we have seen, the Lubaantun story remains dubious. Norman Hammond, anarchaeologist who also excavated Lubaantun, failed to mention the crystal skullin his book on Lubaantun, and he explained to Joe Nickell, a skepticalinvestigator (who figures in the introduction to this book) that this wasbecause the crystal skull had nothing to do with the site. “Rock crystal is notfound naturally in the Maya area” he writes and goes on to mention that thenearest places where it has been found are Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, and theValley of Mexico, where some other small crystal skulls – of Aztec manufacture –have been found. He adds that as far as the documentary evidence shows, AnnaMitchell-Hedges was never in Lubaantun. This seems to be verified by others onthe expedition. (Hammond is also on record as saying, “I have always thoughtthat it is most likely a memento mori [something designed to remind us that wemust all die] of sixteenth- to eighteenth-century origin. While a Renaissanceorigin is not improbable, given the sheer size of the rock crystal blockinvolved, manufacture in Quing-dynasty China for a European client cannot beruled out”.)When we learn that Mitchell-Hedges himself was caught in a lie – his assertionthat he served with the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa and fought at theBattle of Laredo – and that he lost a libel suit against the Daily Express,which claimed in 1928 that he had staged a fake robbery for the sake ofpublicity, it begins to look as if the whole crystal skull story must bedismissed as pure invention. In fact, the first reference to the skull occurs ina journal entitled “Man – A Monthly Record of Anthropological Science” in 1936,in which two experts compare the skull with another in the British Museum andrefer to the former as “the Burney skull”.The Burney referred to is Sydney Burney, an art dealer, and Sotheby’s recordsshow that he put the skull up for auction in late 1943; but since no one bidmore than £340 for it, Burney decided to keep it. It was then, apparently, soldto Mitchell-Hedges in 1944 for £400.When Nickell asked Anna Mitchell-Hedges about this story, he was told thatMitchell-Hedges had left the skull with Burney as security for a loan to financean expedition and that Burney had no right to offer it for sale. But there isnot a scrap of evidence to prove that the skull was in the possession ofMitchell-Hedges before 1944. Moreover, a letter from Sydney Burney, dated 21March 1933 to someone at the American Museum of Natural History declares thatbefore he (Burney) became its owner, the skull had been in the possession of thecollector from whom Burney bought it, and before that, in the collection of anEnglishman.So it would seem almost certain that Mitchell-Hedges invented his story offinding the skull in a Mayan temple and that his daughter has continued tosupport this false version out of an understandable sense of gratitude andloyalty to her adopted father. Presumably this also applies to Mitchell-Hedges’sclaim that the skull had been used to “will someone to death” (AnnaMitchell-Hedges explained that this should be regarded as an expression of hissense of humor) and to various other claims about the skull’s supernaturalpowers – like the newspaper report of a cameraman who fled in terror from thedarkroom when his enlarging bulb exploded as he was trying to enlarge aphotograph of the skull.It all sounds rather disappointing – particularly when we learn that traces of“mechanical grinding” have been found on the teeth. The consensus seems to bethat the “mystery” surrounding the “skull of doom” is a hoax.Yet such a view would be premature. To begin with, the other – and far less“perfect” – crystal skull, which is in possession of the British Museum (andsits at the top of the stairs in the Museum of Man, near Piccadilly Circus inLondon), is generally accepted as genuine, and it also shows traces ofmechanical grinding. The Mexican Indians used a grinding wheel driven by astring stretched across a bow. It seems relatively certain that both skullsoriginated in Mexico. The Museum of Man skull was bought at Tiffany’s, the NewYork jeweler, in 1898 and cost £120.In 1963 Anna Mitchell-Hedges allowed the aforementioned scholar and crystalexpert, Frank Dorland, to borrow the skull and take it to California for tests;he studied it for seven years. One of his most important conclusions was thatthe skull could well be as old as twelve thousand years, although more recentwork has undoubtedly been done on it. Dorland sent the skull to the labouratoryof the Hewlett-Packard Electronics company, which manufactures crystaloscillators. They suggested that the skull had taken a very long time tomanufacture – perhaps three hundred years (twice as long as Mitchell-Hedges’sestimate.) If this is correct, then it seems probably – almost certain – that itwas a religious object, created on the orders of priests and kept in a temple.In that case, its purpose would be connected with divination. It would be kepton an altar – probably covered up (like the crystal balls of clairvoyants) – andexposed for certain ceremonies, probably lit from underneath.Dorland also reported that he was told by friends of Mitchell-Hedges that theskull was brought back from the Holy Land by the Knights Templars during theCrusades and that it was kept in their Inner Sanctum in London until it finallyfound its way on to the antiques market.This is in many ways more plausible than the Mayan temple story. The Templars,founded in 1118 by Hugh de Payens of Champagne, was a religious order whosemembers swore to devote their lives to the defense of the Holy Land and itsChristian pilgrims. Their success was extraordinary and their wealth becamelegendary. This led to their downfall, for their money was coveted by KingPhilip IV of France, who organized a mass arrest of Templars on 13 October 1307.They were accused of black magic, of blasphemy, of renouncing Christ, and ofsexual perversions. One of the major accusations was that they worshiped thedemon Baphomet in the form of a stuffed head or a human skull and that the cordsthey wore around their robes were hallowed by being wrapped around this skull.Some of the lesser accusations against the Templars are acknowledged to be trueby scholars, among them the belief that they practiced ritual magic. Hundreds ofTemplars were executed; yet the king never succeeded in laying his hands ontheir fabled “treasures”. Nothing seems less likely than that the “skull”worshiped by the Templars was an ordinary human skull, and the Mitchell-Hedgesskull would certainly be a perfect candidate for the mysterious talisman.And what of its “mystical” properties? Anna Mitchell-Hedges declared that AdrianConan Doyle, son of Arthur, was unable to bear the skull and disliked even beingin the same room with it. She said he could tell when it was around, even whenit was not visible. Such assertions as these are usually dismissed as typicalattempts at legend building. But Frank Dorland himself concluded, after sevenyears of contact with the skull, that it had mystical properties. He describedhearing sounds of “high-pitched silver bells, very quiet but very noticeable”and sounds like an “a capella choir”. And staring into the skull, he saw imagesof “other skulls, high mountains, fingers and faces”. He stated that the firstnight he kept the skull in his house, he heard the sound of prowling junglecats.This, of course, could be pure autosuggestion. But what happened after a visitfrom “satanist” Anton LaVey could not be dismissed in this way. LaVey called onDorland with the editor of an Oakland newspaper; he claimed that the skull wascreated by Satan and was thus the property of his church. (LaVey has a keensense of humor as well as of publicity.) LaVey ended by playing at some lengthon Dorland’s organ, so that when he left, it was too late to return the skull tothe safe deposit box where it was kept. That night, once again, there were manystrange sounds that kept Dorland and his wife awake. But when they got up toinvestigate, they found nothing. The next morning they found that many of theirbelongings had been displaced, and a crystal rod used as a telephone dialer hadleapt thirty-five feet to the front door.Dorland’s theory is not that the skull itself possesses a “spirit” (orpoltergeist) but that it had absorbed something from LaVey’s presence – thatperhaps La Vey’s “vibes” and those of the skull conflicted, producing physicaleffects. This theory is not as farfetched as it sounds. Clairvoyants usecrystals because they claim they can absorb living energies; they keep themcovered with black velvet because these energies escape when exposed todaylight. Since the time of the oldest known magical beliefs, crystals have beenheld in special esteem because of their powers.Oddly enough, there is now some kind of scientific backing for this notion. Fora decade or more the biologist Rupert Sheldrake has been arguing that learningamong human beings and animals is “transmitted” by a process that he callsmorphic resonance. The most famous story illustrating this process is of themonkeys on Kojima Island, off the coast of Japan, that learned to wash theirpotatoes in the sea because the salt improved the taste; subsequently, assertszoologist Lyall Watson (in Lifetide), monkeys on other islands, with noconnection with the original group, began doing the same thing. Morphicresonance might thus be regarded as a kind of telepathy, and Sheldrake believesthat it plays an active part in evolution.The strange thing is that this phenomenon applies not only to living creaturesbut to crystals as well. Some new chemicals are extremely difficult tocrystallize in the labouratory. But once they have been crystallized anywhere inthe world, the process suddenly becomes faster in all labouratories. At first itwas suspected that this was because scientists were carrying traces of thecrystal in their hair or clothes when they visited other labouratories; but thistheory had to be discounted. It seems that crystals, like living creatures, can“learn” by morphic resonance. So the notion that they can absorb living energiesand radiate them again is less outlandish than it seems.It seems probable that we shall never know the truth about the “skull of doom”,but its resemblance to the British Museum skull suggests that it was probably ofAztec manufacture. What we know of the Aztecs – and their religion of humansacrifice – suggests that it was created as some kind of religious object,possibly used for scrying (short for descrying) – that is, for purposes ofdivination, as a modern clairvoyant uses a crystal ball. But for whateverpurpose it was created, most of those who have seen it seem to agree that it isone of the most beautiful man-made objects in the world."},{"pageContent":"53 Spontaneous Human CombustionOn the evening of Sunday 1 July 1951 Mrs Mary Reeser, aged seventy-seven, seemedslightly depressed as she sat in her overstuffed armchair and smoked acigarette. At about 9 pm her landlady, Mrs Pansy Carpenter, called in to saygoodnight. Mrs Reeser showed no disposition to go to bed yet; it was a hotevening in St Petersburg, Florida.At five the next morning, Mrs Carpenter awoke to a smell of smoke; assuming itwas a water pump that had been overheating, she went to the garage and turned itoff. She was awakened again at eight by a telegraph boy with a telegram for MrsReeser; Mrs Carpenter signed for it and took it up to Mrs Reeser’s room. To hersurprise, the doorknob was hot. She shouted for help, and two decorators workingacross the street came in. One of them placed a cloth over the doorknob andturned it; a blast of hot air met him as the door opened. Yet the place seemedempty, and at first they could see no sign of fire. Then they noticed ablackened circle on the carpet where the armchair had stood. Only a few springsnow remained. In the midst of them there was a human skull, “charred to the sizeof a baseball”, and a fragment of liver attached to a backbone. There was also afoot encased in a satin slipper; it had been burnt down to the ankle.Mrs Reeser was a victim of a baffling phenomenon called spontaneous humancombustion; there are hundreds of recorded cases. Yet in their standard textbookForensic Medicine, Drs S. A. Smith and F. S. Fiddes assert flatly: “Spontaneouscombustion of the human body cannot occur, and no good purpose can be served bydiscussing it”. This is a typical example of the kind of wishful thinking inwhich scientists are prone to indulge when they confront a fact that fallsoutside the range of their experience. In the same way the great chemistLavoisier denied the possibility of meteorites.The example of Mrs Reeser is worth citing because it is mentioned by ProfessorJohn Taylor in his book Science and the Supernatural, a book whose chief purposeis to debunk the whole idea of the “paranormal”, which, according to ProfessorTaylor, tends to “crumble to nothing” as it is scientifically appraised. Yet hethen proceeds to admit that there are instances that seem “reasonably wellvalidated”, and proceeds to cite the case of Mrs Reeser.Twenty-nine years later, in October 1980, a case of spontaneous combustion wasobserved at close quarters when a naval airwoman named Jeanna Winchester wasdriving with a friend, Leslie Scott, along Seaboard Avenue in Jacksonville,Florida. Suddenly, Jeanna Winchester burst into yellow flames, and screamed,“Get me out of here”. Her companion tried to beat out the flames with her hands,and the car ran into a telegraph pole. When Jeanna Winchester was examined itwas found that 20 per cent of her body was covered with burns. But JeannaWinchester survived.Michael Harrison’s book on spontaneous combustion, Fire From Heaven (1976),cites dozens of cases; they make it clear that the chief mystery of spontaneouscombustion is that it seldom spreads beyond the person concerned. On Whit Monday1725, in Rheims, Nicole Millet, the wife of the landlord of the Lion d’Or, wasfound burnt to death in an unburnt armchair, and her husband was accused of hermurder. But a young surgeon, Claude-Nicholas Le Cat, succeeded in persuading thecourt that spontaneous human combustion does occur, and Millet was acquitted –the verdict was that his wife had died “by a visitation of God”. The caseinspired a Frenchman called Jonas Dupont to gather together all the evidence hecould find for spontaneous combustion, which he published in a book De IncendiisCorporis Humani Spontaneis, printed in Leyden in 1763.Another famous case of this period was that of Countess Cornelia di Bandi, ofCesena, aged sixty-two, who was found on the floor of her bedroom by her maid.Her stockinged legs were untouched, and between them lay her head, half burnt.The rest of the body was reduced to ashes, and the air was full of floatingsoot. The bed was undamaged and the sheets had been thrown back, as if she hadgot out – perhaps to open a window – and then been quickly consumed as she stoodupright, so the head had fallen between the legs. Unlike the wife of innkeeperMillet, the countess had not been a heavy drinker. (One of the most populartheories of spontaneous combustion at this period was that it was due to largequantities of alcohol in the body.)Two nineteenth-century novelists used spontaneous combustion to dispose ofunwanted characters. Captain Marryat borrowed details from a Times report of1832 to describe the death of the mother of his hero Jacob Faithful (in thenovel of the same name), who is reduced to “a sort of unctuous pitchy cinder” inher bed. Twenty years later, in 1852, Dickens put an end to his drunkenrag-and-bone dealer Krook in Bleak House by means of spontaneous combustion –Krook is charred to a cinder that looks like a burnt log. G.H. Lewes, GeorgeEliot’s lover, took issue with Dickens and declared that spontaneous combustionwas impossible, so in his preface to Bleak House Dickens contradicts Lewes andcites thirty examples from press reports. Yet at the end of his article on Krookin The Dickens Encyclopedia (1924), Arthur L. Hayward states dogmatically: “Thepossibility of spontaneous combustion in human beings has been finallydisproved”. He fails to explain what experiments have “finally disproved” it.Harrison’s book, which gathers together the result of many studies, leaves nopossible doubt of the reality of spontaneous combustion. But what causes it? Atpresent it must be confessed that the phenomenon baffles medical knowledge. ButHarrison offers some interesting clues. He speaks of the researches of anAmerican doctor, Mayne R. Coe junior, who was interested in the subject oftelekinesis – mind over matter. Coe was able to move aluminium strips pivoted onthe points of needles by moving his hand over them – this was obviously due tosome natural physical “magnetism”. He began various yoga exercises in an attemptto develop his bioelectricity; sitting one day in an easy-chair, he felt apowerful current passing downward from his head throughout his body; he thoughtit was of high voltage but low amperage. He suspended a cardboard box from theceiling on a length of string, and found that he could cause it to move from adistance – when the room was dry, from as much as eight feet. He then chargedhis body with 35,000 volts DC, using an electric current, and found that hecould move the box in exactly the same way. This seemed to prove that he was infact generating a high voltage current with his mental exercises. He also wentup in an aeroplane to an altitude of 21,000 feet, where the air was extremelydry, and produced electric sparks after he had charged his body to 35,000 volts.Coe theorized that this could explain the phenomenon of levitation – when theyogi’s body floats off the ground – with the positively charged human bodyrepelling the negatively charged earth.Harrison also cites cases of human “batteries” and magnets people (usuallychildren) who have developed a powerful electric charge. In 1877 Caroline Clareof London, Ontario, turned into a human magnet, who attracted metal objects andcould give a powerful electric shock to as many as twenty people holding hands.She was suffering from adolescent depressions at the time. Frank McKinistry ofJoplin, Missouri, developed a magnetic force which caused his feet to stick tothe earth. In 1895 fourteen-year-old Jennie Morgan of Sedalia, Missouri,generated a charge sufficient to knock a grown man on his back, and when shetouched a pump handle sparks flew from her fingertips. It is also worth notingthat many teenagers who became the focus of “poltergeist effects” (see chapter41) developed magnetic or electrical properties; in 1846 a French girl namedAngélique Cottin became a kind of human electric battery; objects that touchedher flew off violently, and a heavy oak loom began to dance when she came nearit. On the other hand, Esther Cox, the “focus” of the disturbances at GreatAmherst in Nova Scotia, developed a magnetism that made cutlery fly to her andstick fast. It seems that there must be two kinds of charges, positive andnegative.According to Dr Coe, each human muscle cell is a battery, and a cubic inch coulddevelop 400,000 volts. (The inventor Nicola Tesla used to demonstrate that thehuman body can take immense electrical charges – enough to light up neon tubes –provided the amperage is kept very low.)But this seems unlikely to explain spontaneous combustion: the whole point ofTesla’s experiments was that he did not burst into flame. It is high amperagethat can cause “burn-ups”. (If two 12-volt car batteries are connected by thinwire, the wire will melt; even thick wire becomes hot.) And this could begin toexplain why the surroundings of victims of spontaneous combustion are undamaged;they are non-conductors.Victims of spontaneous combustion tend to be the old and the young. On 27 August1938, the 22-year-old Phyllis Newcombe was dancing vigorously in Chelmsford,Essex, when her body glowed with a blue light which turned into flames; she diedwithin minutes. In October of the same year a girl called Maybelle Andrews wasdancing in a Soho nightclub with her boy-friend, Billy Clifford, when flameserupted from her back, chest and shoulders. Her boy-friend, who was badly burnedtrying to put her out, said that there were no flames in the room – the flamesseemed to come from the girl herself. She died on the way to hospital. In suchcases it seems just conceivable that the activity of dancing built up some kindof static electricity. Michael Harrison even points out that “ritual dancing” isused by primitive tribes to build up emotional tension in religious ceremonies,and suggests that this is what has happened here.Michael Harrison also points out some curious geographical links. On 13 March1966 three men were “spontaneously combusted” at the same time. John Greeley,helmsman of the SS Ulrich, was burnt to a cinder some miles west of Land’s End;George Turner, a lorry-driver, was found burnt at the wheel of his lorry atUpton-by-Chester – the lorry overturned in a ditch; in Nijmegen, Holland,eighteen-year-old Willem ten Bruik died at the wheel of his car. As usual insuch cases, the surroundings of all three were undamaged. Harrison points outthat the three men were at the points of an equilateral triangle whose sideswere 340 miles long. Is it conceivable that the earth itself discharged energyin a triangular pattern?Another investigator, Larry Arnold, put forward his own theory in the magazineFrontiers of Science (January 1982): that so-called “ley lines” – lines of“earth force” may be involved. The man who “discovered” ley lines, AlfredWatkins, noted how frequently places called “Brent” occur on them (brent beingan old English form of “burnt”). Other “ley-hunters” have suggested thatmegalithic stone circles are placed at crucial points on ley lines – often atcrossing-points of several leys. It is again interesting to note how many stonecircles are associated with the idea of dancing – for example, the Merry Maidensin Cornwall; Stonehenge itself was known as “the Giants’ Dance”. It has beensuggested that ritual dances occurred at these sites, so that the dancers wouldsomehow interact with the earth energy (or “telluric force”).Larry Arnold drew a dozen or so major leys on a map of England, then set out tofind if they were associated with mystery fires. He claims that one400-mile-long “fire-leyne” (as he calls them) passed through five towns whereten mysterious blazes had concurred. He also notes several cases of spontaneouscombustion occurring on this “leyne”. He cites four cases which occurred on itbetween 1852 and 1908.Harrison believes that spontaneous combustion is basically a “mental freak”,where the mind somehow influences the body to build up immense charges. Theanswer could lie in either of the two theories, or in a combination of the two."},{"pageContent":"54 Synchronicity or “Mere Coincidence”?The Sunday Times journalist Godfrey Smith was thinking of writing somethingabout the “saga of lost manuscripts” – Carlyle’s manuscript of The FrenchRevolution, burnt by a careless maid, T.E. Lawrence’s Seven Pillars of Wisdom,left in a taxi, Hemingway’s suitcase full of early manuscripts, stolen from atrain – and decided to call on the literary agent Hilary Rubinstein, atreasure-house of similar stories. But before he could introduce the subjectinto the conversation a girl sitting with them – the wife of the novelistNicholas Mosley – mentioned that her husband was upset because he had just hadthe first 150 pages of his new novel stolen from his car. Smith remarked in hisSunday Times column: “We are back in what J. W. Dunne called serial time, andArthur Koestler called synchronicity, and some of us still call coincidence . ..”It was Jung in fact who coined the word “synchronicity” for meaningfulcoincidence. But Arthur Koestler was equally intrigued by the subject, anddiscussed it in a book called The Roots of Coincidence in 1972. In the followingyear he wrote an article about coincidence in The Sunday Times and appealed toreaders for examples. Many of these were utilized in his book The Challenge ofChance (1973), co-authored by Sir Alister Hardy and Robert Harvie. He beginswith a section called “The Library Angel”, describing coincidences involved withbooks. In 1972 Koestler had been asked to write about the chess championshipbetween Boris Spassky and Bobbie Fischer, so he went to the London Library tolook up books on chess and books on Iceland. He decided to start with chess andthe first book that caught his eye was entitled Chess in Iceland by WilliardFiske.He then tells of how Dame Rebecca West was trying to check up on an episoderelated by one of the accused in one of the Nuremberg war-crimes trials, and howshe discovered to her annoyance that the trials are published in the form ofabstracts under arbitrary headings and are therefore useless to a researcher.After an hour of fruitless searching she approached a librarian and said: “Ican’t find it . . .”, and casually took a volume off the shelf and opened it. Itopened at the page she had been searching for.This anecdote is particularly interesting because it involved an apparently“random” action, a casual reaching out without logical purpose. The word“synchronicity” was coined by Jung in connection with the I Ching, the ChineseBook of Changes, which the Chinese consult as an “oracle”. The method of“consulting” the I Ching consists of throwing down three coins at random half adozen times and noting whether there are more heads or tails. Two or three tailsgives a line with a break in the middle, thus three heads gives an unbrokenline. The six lines, placed on top of one another, form a “hexagram”:[images/00004.jpg] The above hexagram is number 58, “The Joyous – Lake”, with a “Judgement:”: “TheJoyous, Success – Perseverance is favourable”. But from the logical point ofview it is obviously impossible to explain how throwing down coins at random canprovide an answer – even if the question has been very clearly and preciselyformulated in the mind before the coins are thrown.The experience of Rebecca West can provide a glimmering of an answer. She waslooking for a particular passage. We may assume that some unconscious faculty of“extra-sensory perception” guided her to the right place before she began tospeak to the librarian, and then guided her hand as she casually reached out.But could it also cause the book to open in the right place? This would seem torequire something more than “ESP”, something for which Horace Walpole coined theword “serendipity”, “the faculty of making happy and unexpected discoveries bychance”. And what of the “chance” that caused the librarian to be standing inthe right place at that moment? We have here such a complex situation that it isdifficult to conceive of some purely “passive” faculty – a kind of intuition –capable of accounting for it. Unless we wish to fall back on “coincidence”, wehave to think in terms of some faculty capable to some extent of “engineering” asituation as well as merely taking advantage of it. And the use of the I Chingalso seems to presuppose the use of such a faculty in causing the coins to fallin a certain order.For most of his life Jung was unwilling even to conceive of such a possibility –at least publicly. (He was, in fact, using the I Ching as an oracle from theearly 1920s.)In 1944, when he was sixty-eight years old, Jung slipped on an icy road andbroke his ankle; this led to a severe heart attack. While hovering between lifeand death, Jung experienced curious visions, in one of which he was hoveringabove the earth, out in space, then saw a kind of Hindu temple inside a meteor.“Night after night I floated in a state of purest bliss”. He was convinced thatif he recovered his doctor would have to die – and in fact the doctor died asJung started to recover. The result of these strange experiences was that Jungceased to be concerned about whether his contemporaries regarded him as a mysticrather than a scientist, and he ceased to make a secret of his lifelong interestin “the occult”. In 1949 he wrote his influential introduction to RichardWilhelm’s edition of the I Ching, in which he speaks about the “acausalconnecting principle” called synchronicity; in the following year he wrote hispaper On Synchronicity, later expanded into a book. Unfortunately, Jung’sfundamental premise in both these seminal works is basically nonsensical.Western science, he says, is based on the principle of causality, but modernphysics is shaking this principle to its foundations; we now know that naturallaws are merely statistical truths, and that therefore we must allow forexceptions. This is, of course, untrue. The philosopher Hume had argued thatcausality is not a basic law of the universe; a pan of water usually boils whenwe put it on a fire, but it might freeze. Kant later used this argument todemonstrate that the stuff of the universe is basically “mental”. We can now seethat these arguments were fallacious. It is true that a pan of water mightfreeze when placed on a fire, if the atmospheric pressure were suddenlyincreased a thousandfold. But this would not be a defiance of the law ofcausality, merely a change in some of the basic conditions of the experiment.And by the same argument, we can see that modern physics has not demonstratedthat the laws of nature are “statistical”, and that once in a billion times theymight be “broken”. A law of nature cannot be broken except for some very good“legal” reason.So Jung’s talk about an “acausal connecting principle” may be dismissed asverbal mystification, designed to throw dust in the eyes of scientists who wouldotherwise accuse him of becoming superstitious in his old age. The example Junggives of synchronicity makes this clear. He tells how, on 1 April 1949, they hadfish for lunch, and someone mentioned the custom of making an “April fish”(i.e., April fool) of someone. In the afternoon a patient showed him pictures offish which she had painted. In the evening he was shown a piece of embroiderywith fish-like monsters on it. The next morning another patient told him of adream of a fish. At this time Jung was studying the fish symbol in history, andbefore this string of coincidences began had made a note of a Latin quotationabout fish. It is, says Jung, very natural to feel that this is a case of“meaningful coincidence” – i.e., that there is an “acausal connection”. But ifthe coincidence is “meaningful”, then there must be a causal connection – evenif (as Jung is implying) it is not one that would be recognized by science. Jungis in fact suggesting that there is some hidden connection between the mind andnature.Jung was not the first to consider this possibility. The Austrian biologist PaulKammerer – who committed suicide after being accused of faking some of hisexperiments – was fascinated by odd coincidences, and wrote a book, The Law ofSeries, about it. The book contains a hundred samples of coincidence. Forexample, in 1915 his wife was reading about a character called Mrs Rohan in anovel; on the tram soon after she saw a man who resembled her friend PrinceRohan; that evening Prince Rohan dropped in to see them. In the tram she hadheard someone ask the man who looked like Rohan whether he knew the village ofWeissenbach on Lake Attersee; when she got off the tram she walked into adelicatessen shop, and the assistant asked her if she knew Weissenbach on LakeAttersee . . .Kammerer’s theory was that events do happen in “clusters”, which are natural butnot “causal”. He thought of it as some unknown mathematical law – a “law ofseriality”. In short, “absurd” coincidences are a law of nature. He spent hisdays carefully noting all kinds of things – the age, sex and dress of peoplewalking past him in a park or sitting on a tram – and observed the typical“clustering”.Jung offers one of the most amusing examples of “clustering” in his book onsynchronicity – it was originally told by the scientist Camille Flammarion inhis book The Unknown. The poet Emile Deschamps was given a piece of plum puddingby a certain M. Fortgibu when he was at boarding-school – the dish was thenalmost unknown in France, but Fortgibu had just returned from England. Ten yearslater Deschamps saw plum pudding in the window of a Paris restaurant and went into ask if he could have some. He was told that unfortunately the pudding hadbeen ordered by someone else – M. Fortgibu, who was sitting there, and whooffered to share it. Years later he attended a party at which there was to beplum pudding, and he told the story about M. Fortgibu. As they sat eating plumpudding the door opened and a servant announced “Monsieur Fortgibu”. In walkedFortgibu, who had been invited to another apartment in the same building, andhad mistaken the door.This seems to be a good example of Kammerer’s seriality; if there is any“meaning” in the coincidence, it is not apparent. But another example given byFlammarion is a different matter. When he was writing a book a gust of windcarried the pages out of the window; at the same moment it began to rain. Hedecided there would be no point in going to get them. A few days later thechapter arrived from his printer. It seemed the porter of the printing officehad walked past, seen the pages on the ground, and assumed he had dropped themhimself; so he gathered them together, sorted them, and delivered them to theprinter. What was the subject of the chapter? The wind . . .So it would seem there are two types of coincidence: serial “clusterings”, whichare purely “mechanical”, and synchronicities, which might seem to imply that themind itself has been able to influence the laws of nature – as when Rebecca Westsnatched the book at random off the shelf.Koestler gives an even stranger example of synchronicity. The writer PearlBinder was planning a satirical novel in association with two collabourators.They invented a situation in which camps for the homeless had been set up inHyde Park. They decided to have a refugee Viennese professor, a broken-down oldman with a Hungarian-sounding name – such as Horvath-Nadoly. Two days later theyread in the newspaper that a homeless foreign old man had been found wanderingalone at night in Hyde Park, and had given his name as Horvath-Nadoly. Here allthree collabourators had contributed to the impossible coincidence. So if it isto be regarded as “meaningful” rather than an example of “serial clustering”,then it has to be supposed that all three participated in some odd form oftelepathy and/or precognition; i.e., that called upon to “invent” a situation atrandom, their unconscious minds preferred to cheat by supplying them withdetails about a real person – just as, asked to invent a name on the spur of themoment, we shall probably choose a name we have just seen or heard . . .This “unconscious” explanation – preferred by Jung – can explain dozens ofcurious coincidences involving literature. In 1898 a novelist named MorganRobertson wrote a book about a ship called the Titan, “the safest vessel in theworld”, which hit an iceberg on her maiden voyage across the Atlantic; fourteenyears later his story came to life in the tragic maiden voyage of the Titanic.Moreover, the editor W. T. Stead had written a story about a ship that sank, andconcluded: “This is exactly what might take place, and what will take place, ifliners are sent to sea short of boats”. Like the liner in Morgan Robertson’snovel, the Titanic did not have enough boats. And W. T. Stead was one of thosewho drowned.In 1885 a playwright named Arthur Law wrote a play about a man called RobertGolding, the sole survivor of the shipwreck of a vessel called the Caroline. Afew days after it was staged, Law read an account of the sinking of a shipcalled the Caroline; the sole survivor was called Robert Golding.In 1972 a wrter named James Rusk published a pornographic novel called BlackAbductor under a pseudonym; its plot was so similar to the true story of thekidnapping of heiress Patty Hearst in 1974 by the “Symbionese Liberation Army” –even to the name of the victim, Patricia – that the FBI later interrogated Ruskto find if he had been involved in the kidnapping plot. He had not; it was again“pure coincidence”.In the month preceding the Allied invasion of Normandy – D-Day – the DailyTelegraph crossword puzzle gave most of the codewords for the operation: Utah,Mulberry, Neptune and Overlord (the last being the name of the whole operation).MI5 was called to investigate, but found that the compiler of the crosswords wasa schoolmaster named Dawe who had no idea of how the words had come into hishead.To explain “synchronistic” events, Jung was inclined to refer to a phrase of theFrench psychologist Pierre Janet, abaissement du niveau mental, “lowering of themental threshold”, by which Janet meant a certain lowering of the vital forces –such as we experience when we are tired or discouraged and which is theprecondition for neurosis. Jung believed that when the mental threshold islowered “the tone of the unconscious is heightened, thereby creating a gradientfor the unconscious to flow towards the conscious”. The conscious then comesunder the influence of what Jung calls the “archetypes” or “primordial images”.These images belong to the “collective unconscious”, and might be – for example– of a “great mother”, a hero-god, a devil-figure, or an image of incarnatewisdom. Jung thought that when the archetype is activated odd coincidences arelikely to happen.Jung worked out his idea of synchronicity with the aid of the physicist WolfgangPauli. Pauli himself seemed to have some odd power of causing coincidences.Whenever he touched some piece of experimental apparatus it tended to break. Oneday in Göttingen a complicated apparatus for studying atomic events collapsedwithout warning, and Professor J. Franck is said to have remarked: “Pauli mustbe around somewhere”. He wrote to Pauli, and received a reply saying that at thetime of the accident his train had been standing in the station at Göttingen, onits way to Copenhagen. Pauli, understandably, was intrigued by Jung’s ideasabout synchronicity, and Jung’s book on the subject was published together witha paper by Pauli on archetypal ideas in the work of Kepler – Kepler hadapparently stumbled on the idea of archetypes three centuries earlier, althoughhe meant something closer to Plato’s “ideas”. Pauli had created a hypothesiscalled “the exclusion principle”, which says that only one electron at a timecan occupy any “planetary orbit” inside an atom. He gave no physical reason forthis notion; it simply seemed to him to have a pleasing mathematical symmetry,rather like Avogadro’s hypothesis that equal volumes of gases will have equalnumbers of molecules. In his own essay on Kepler in The Encyclopedia ofPhilosophy, Koestler tried to show that Kepler had arrived at his correctresults about the solar system through completely nonsensical ideas about theBlessed Trinity and other such notions, the implication being that creativeminds have some instinct or intuition that shows them scientific truths, on someprinciple of symmetry or beauty, rather than through logical reasoning. And thisin itself implies that there is some strange basic affinity between mind andnature, and that mind is not some accidental product that has no “right” to bein the universe. It was this intuition that drew Jung and Pauli together.More to the point is a passage in the writing of the medieval “magician”Albertus Magnus:> A certain power to alter things indwells in the human soul and subordinates> the other things to her, particularly when she is swept into a great excess of> love or hate or the like. When therefore the soul of man falls into a great> excess of any passion, it can be proved by experiment that the [excess] binds> things together [magically] and alters them in the way it wants. Whoever would> learn the secret of doing and undoing these things must know that everyone can> influence everything magically if he falls into a great excess.> > That is to say, a psychological state can somehow affect the physical world. ButAlbertus’s “great excess” is clearly the opposite of Jung’s “lowering of themental threshold”. One is a lowering of vitality, the other an intensificationof it.Some of the concepts of “split-brain physiology” – a science developed afterJung’s death in 1961 – may be able to throw a useful light on these problems.The brain is divided into two hemispheres, rather like a walnut. Brainphysiology has established that the left cerebral hemisphere is concerned withour conscious objectives – language, logic, calculation – while the right dealswith intuition, pattern-recognition and insight. The remarkable discovery madeby Roger Sperry was that when the bridge of nerves – called the corpus callosum– which connects the two halves is severed to prevent epilepsy the patient turnsinto two people. One split-brain patient tried to hit his wife with one handwhile the other held it back. The person I call “me” lives in the lefthemisphere; the person who lives in the other half – the “intuitive self” – is astranger. When a female patient was shown an indecent picture with her rightbrain, she blushed; asked why she was blushing, she replied: “I don’t know”.The right-brain “stranger” is an artist; the left-brain “me” is a scientist.There is some interesting evidence that it is this right-brain “stranger” who isinvolved in so-called “extra-sensory perception” – telepathy, dowsing, “secondsight” – and that his main problem is somehow to communicate the things he knowsto the logical self, which is too preoccupied in its own practical purposes topay attention to the “still, small voice” of the “other self”.The “stranger” can at times “take over”. When the English boxer Freddie Millsfought Gus Lesnevitch in 1946 he was knocked down in the second round andconcussed. He remembered nothing more until he heard the referee announcing thetenth round. But in the intervening seven rounds he had boxed brilliantlyagainst the much heavier Lesnevitch, and was ahead on points. As soon as he“recovered” consciousness he began to lose. His “other self” had taken over whenhe was knocked down in the second round. Here is an example where a “lowering ofthe mental threshold” produced positive results.If, then, we credit the “other person” with some kind of “extra-sensoryperception”, it would be possible to explain such phenomena as the activities of“the library angel” – for example, how Rebecca West located the trial she waslooking for by reaching out casually. It knows where the trial is located, butit cannot communicate its knowledge to the left brain, which is obsessivelysearching through the catalogues. Then a librarian approaches, and it sees itschance as he stops near the book. She is prompted to go and complain to thelibrarian – a relatively easy task, since she is seething with exasperation –and then the “other self” reaches out for the book and, with that intuitiveskill that we see in great sportsmen, opens it at the right place . . . (Itwould be interesting to know if Rebecca West reached out with her left hand –for the left side of the body is controlled by the right brain, and vice versa.)And how does the ESP hypothesis apply to another story told by Rebecca West andquoted by Koestler? Again she was in the London Library, and had asked anassistant for Gounod’s Memoirs. As she was waiting she was approached by anAmerican who had recognized her, and who wanted to know if it was true that shepossessed some lithographs by the artist Delpeche. She said she did, and theywere still talking when the assistant returned with the book. She opened itcasually, and found herself looking at a passage in which Gounod describes howkind Delpeche had been to his mother.Now here, we can see, the chain of coincidences had been set in motion – by herrequest for the book – before the stranger came and asked her about Delpeche; sowe cannot accuse her “other self” of engineering the whole situation. What wecan suppose is that the “other self” was somehow aware that the Gounod Memoirscontained a reference to the artist they were speaking about at that verymoment, and drew her attention to it by causing her to open the book in theright place . . .Why? One possible answer is self-evident. Modern man has become a“split-brainer”; for the most part, he lives in the left brain. This means thathe is only aware of half his identity. Whenever he is reminded of that otherhalf – for example, when music or poetry produce a sudden “warm glow”, or whensome smell reminds him vividly of childhood – he experiences the strange senseof wild elation that G.K. Chesterton called “absurd good news”. The more hefeels “trapped” in his left-brain self by fatigue, discouragement, foreboding –the more he actually cuts himself off from that deep inner sense of purpose andwell-being. If he had some instant method of re-establishing contact with thisinner power – Abraham Maslow called such contacts “peak experiences” – his lifewould be transformed. It must be irritating for that “other self” to see theleft-brain self plunging itself into states of gloom and boredom that arecompletely unnecessary, and so wasting its life – both their lives. So, as afruitful hypothesis, we might regard “synchronicities” – like the one involvingGounod’s Memoirs – as attempts by the “other self” to remind the left-brainpersonality of its existence, and to rescue it from its sense of “contingency” –the feeling that Proust describes, of feeling “mediocre, accidental, mortal”.There is, unfortunately, another type of synchronicity that cannot be explainedon the ESP hypothesis and this is the very type that Jung originally set out toexplain. ESP cannot explain how the I Ching could produce a “meaningful” answerto a question (if, of course, it actually does so). Common sense tells us thatthe throwing down of coins can only produce a chance result, unless the coinsare somehow “interfered with” as they fall. The Chinese believe that the I Chingis some kind of living entity – presumably a supernatural one – and we mayassume that this entity answers the question by causing the coins to fall in acertain way. The Western psychologist, rejecting the supernatural explanation,can only fall back on the notion that the unconscious mind – the “other self” –can somehow influence the fall of the coins by some form of psychokinesis, “mindover matter”. And while this may be more or less satisfactory in explaining howthe I Ching works, it still fails to explain, for example, the fishsynchronicities that Jung found so intriguing: the Latin inscription about afish, the mention of “April fish”, the patient who had painted fish, theembroidery with fish-like monsters, the other patient with the dream of a fish.Psychokinesis can hardly explain this series of coincidences.This is true also of a type of “cluster” coincidence described by Koestler. Adoctor wrote to him commenting that if a patient with some rare and unusualcomplaint turns up at a surgery, he could be fairly certain that a similar casewould turn up later during the same surgery, and that if a patient with acertain name – say, Donnell – should ring him, then another patient calledDonnell would be almost certain to turn up at the surgery. Another lettermentioned similar “clusters” of various types: a dentist noting how often he had“runs” of patients with the same kind of extraction problem, an eye specialistnoting how often he had runs of patients with the same eye problem, even atypewriter-repairer noticing how often he had runs of the same make of machinefor repair, or runs of different machines with the identical problem.Obviously there can be no “explanation” for such oddities unless a mathematiciandiscovers some completely new law of seriality. But again, we can note that suchcoincidences tend to produce in us much the same effect as more personalexperiences of “serendipity” – a sense that perhaps the universe is lessmeaningless and inscrutable than we assume. And this – as every reader of Jung’sbook will agree – is what Jung felt about synchronicity. In fact, a hostilecritic might object that Jung – who was the son of a parson – is trying tointroduce God by the back door. All his attempts to argue in favour of a“scientific” principle of synchronicity are unconvincing because the words“acausal connecting principle” involve a contradiction in terms – unless, thatis, he is willing to admit that it is “pure chance”, in which case he hasundermined his own argument. A coincidence is either “meaningful” or it is not;and if it is meaningful, then it is not a coincidence.In the last analysis, accepting or rejecting “synchronicity” is a matter ofindividual temperament. I personally am inclined to accept it because my ownexperience of “coincidences” inclines me to the belief that they are often“meaningful”. On the morning when I was about to begin the article on Joan ofArc in the present book, I noticed in my library a bound series of theInternational History Magazine, and decided to spend half an hour lookingthrough it in case it contained material for this book. I opened the firstvolume at random, and found myself looking at an article on Joan of Arc, whoseeditorial introduction raised the question of whether she survived her“execution”. In fact, the article proved to be useless: the author made nomention of the controversy about the Dame des Armoires. Does this not in itselfsuggest that the coincidence was “non-meaningful”? Not necessarily. I have citedelsewhere (see chapter 57) Jacques Vallee’s interesting theory aboutsynchronicity. When he was researching a cult that used the name of the prophetMelchizedek he spent a great deal of time looking up every reference toMelchizedek he could find. In Los Angeles he asked a woman taxi-driver for areceipt: it was signed M. Melchizedek. A check with the Los Angeles telephonedirectory revealed that there was only one Melchizedek in the whole area.Vallee points out that there are two ways in which a librarian can storeinformation. One is to place it in alphabetical order on shelves. But computerscientists have discovered that there is a simpler and quicker method. Theyprefer to store information as it arrives – the equivalent of a librarianputting books on the shelves side by side as they come into the library – andhaving a keyword or algorithm that will retrieve it. (In a library, theequivalent might be as follows: as each new book comes into the library, somekind of “beeping” mechanism is attached to its spine; each beeper is adjusted torespond to a certain number code, like a telephone. When the librarian requiresa certain book, he dials the number on his pocket beeper, and then goes straightto the book that is beeping.)Vallee suggests that “the world might be organised more like a randomised database than a sequential library”. It was as if he had stuck on the universalnotice-board a note saying; “Wanted, Melchidezeks”, and some earnest librarianhad said: “How about this one?” “No, that’s no good – that’s just a taxi driver. . .”This picture, like Jung’s, suggests that there is some mutual interactionbetween the mind and the universe, and that the key to “retrieving information”is to be in the right state of mind: a state of deep interest or excitement:Albertus Magnus’s “excess of passion”.Another personal example. I was led to write the present article partly by the“Joan of Arc coincidence”, partly by another coincidence that happened a day ortwo later. I had received in the post a copy of the biography of the Americannovelist Ayn Rand by Barbara Branden. I was reading this in bed the next daywhen the post arrived. This included a paperback novel sent to me by an Americanreader, with a letter enclosed. The letter began: “In Barbara Branden’s recentbiography of Ayn Rand you are mentioned in a footnote . . .”Half an hour later, about to go to my study, I noticed a newspaper clipping thatmy wife had left for me outside the door. I asked her “What’s this?”, and shesaid: “It’s an article that mentions Hemingway – I thought it might interestyou.” In fact it was the article about coincidence and lost manuscripts byGodfrey Smith, quoted at the beginning of the present article.As it happened, I decided not to write the coincidence article immediately; Ihad planned first of all to write a piece about the disappearance of MaryRogers. I took Poe’s short stories from my bookshelf and opened it at “TheMystery of Marie Roget”. The opening paragraph reads: “There are few persons,even among the calmest thinkers, who have not occasionally been startled into avague yet thrilling half-credence in the supernatural, by coincidences of soseemingly marvellous a character that, as mere coincidences, the intellect hasbeen unable to receive them.” It confirmed my decision to write this article.As if to underline this point, a further coincidence occurred after I hadwritten the preceding sentence, which happened to be at the end of a day’s work.About to leave my study, I noticed among an untidy pile of books a title I hadno recollection of seeing before: You Are Sentenced to Life by W.D. Chesney,published by a private press in California; it was a book about life afterdeath. I had obviously bought it a long time ago and had never – as far as Iknow – even glanced into it. I decided it was time to remedy this. Later in theafternoon, I spent an hour glancing through it, reading a section here andthere; then, just before closing it, I decided to glance at the very end. Thetop of the last page was headed: ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK, and was a reprint of aletter from Grace Hooper Pettipher, “Instructor within the Order ofMelchizedek”, requesting a copy of another book published by the same press. Idoubt whether, in two thousand or so books in my study, there is anotherreference to Melchizedek; but I had to stumble upon this one after writing aboutMelchizedek in an article about synchronicity.It is my own experience that coincidences like this seem to happen when I am in“good form” – when I am feeling alert, cheerful and optimistic, and not when Iam feeling tired, bored or gloomy. This leads me to formulate my own hypothesisabout synchronicity as follows. As a writer, I am at my best when I feel alertand purposeful; at these times I feel a sense of “hidden meanings” lurkingbehind the apparently impassive face of everyday reality. But this is not trueonly for writers; it applies to all human beings. We are all at our best whenthe imagination is awake, and we can sense the presence of that “other self”,the intuitive part of us. When we are tired or discouraged we feel “stranded” inleft-brain consciousness. We feel, as William James says, that “our fires aredamped, our draughts are checked”. We can be jarred out of this state by asudden crisis, or any pleasant stimulus, but more often than not these fail topresent themselves. It must be irritating for “the other self” to find itspartner so dull and sluggish, allowing valuable time and opportunity to leakaway by default. A “synchronicity” can snap us into a sudden state of alertnessand awareness. And if the “other self” can, by the use of its peculiar powers,bring about a synchronicity, then there is still time to prevent us from wastingyet another day of our brief lives.The Melchizedek coincidence seems to me of another kind, designed to confirmthat we are on “the right track”. When in the late 1960s I first turned myattention to the field of the paranormal, and began writing a book called TheOccult, such coincidences became commonplace. I have described in that book howI needed a reference from some alchemical text. I knew that the book containingthe reference was in one of the books facing my desk; but it was towards the endof the day, and I was feeling tired and lazy. Besides, I had forgotten where tofind the reference, and my heart sank at the prospect of a fruitless searchthrough half a dozen volumes . . . Conscience finally triumphed and I heavedmyself to my feet, crossed the room, and took a book off the shelf. As I did sothe next book fell off the shelf; it landed on the floor, open, at the passage Iwas looking for. And I felt that curious flash of gratitude and delight that wealways experience in these moments, as if some invisible guardian angel haspolitely tendered his help.Now, a book falling off a shelf and opening at the right page is obviouslycloser to the procedure of the I Ching than, for example, Mrs Kammerer’s chainof coincidences about Prince Rohan and Lake Attersee, or Flammarion’s storyabout M. Fortgibu. Yet it seems equally obvious that, in a basic sense, there isa family resemblance between them. The problem arises if we attempt some kind ofclassification. When Rebecca West reached out and found the right book, thissounds like ESP. But a book falling off a shelf at the right page obviouslyinvolves some extra element besides ESP – something closer to psychokinesis. Butneither ESP nor psychokinesis can begin to explain Mrs Kammerer’s chain ofcoincidences; and in the case of M. Fortgibu and the plum pudding, it becomesabsurd. We seem to be dealing with the mysterious entity that Charles Fortcalled “the cosmic joker”, and any respectable parapsychologist is bound to drawback in horror at the very idea.But even if synchronicity declines to fit into any of our scientific theories,this is no reason to refuse to believe in its existence. Science still has noidea of how or why the universe began, of the nature of time, or of what liesbeyond the outermost limit of the stars. In fact, science continues to use termslike space, time and motion as if they were comprehensible to the humanintellect; no one accuses Cantor of being an occultist or mystic because hedevised a mathematics of infinity. Science continues to grow and develop inspite of its uneasy metaphysical foundations.From the purely practical point of view, the chief problem of human existence isindividual lack of purpose. In those curious moments of relaxation or suddenhappiness that we all experience at intervals, we can see that it is stupid tolose purpose and direction, and that if only we could learn to summon thisinsight at will, this fatal tendency to forgetfulness could be permanentlyeradicated, and life would be transformed. It is obvious in such moments that ifwe could train ourselves to behave as if there were hidden meanings lurkingbehind the blank face of the present, the problem would be solved. If“synchronicities” can produce that sense of meaning and purpose, then it isobviously sensible for us to behave as if they were meaningful coincidences, andto ignore the question of their scientific validity."},{"pageContent":"55 Time in DisarrayTime Slips and PrecognitionsThe late Ivan T. Sanderson, the eminent naturalist and scientist, once had acurious experience of Paris. But it was the Paris not of today, but of fivecenturies ago; and, to make the story still more paradoxical, it happened inHaiti.Before beginning his account (in More “Things”), Sanderson is careful to notethat he has never taken any interest in “the occult” – not because he activelydisbelieves in it, but because “I have only one life to lead . . . and I’ve beenfar too busy trying to catch up with the more pragmatic facts of it”.Sanderson and his wife were living in a small village named Pont Beudet inHaiti; together with his assistant Frederick G. Allsop, he was engaged in abiological survey. One beautiful evening the three of them decided to drive toLake Azuey in their ancient Rolls-Royce. Taking a short cut down an old dirtroad, they drove into a squashy mass of mud, and went in up to their axles. Theygot out and began to walk. They walked through most of the night until they wereexhausted. They encountered a car with an American doctor on his way to a case,but he had no room for three of them; he promised to try and pick them up on hisway back. They plodded on in the moonlight. Then:> . . . suddenly, on looking up from the dusty ground I perceived absolutely> clearly in the now brilliant moonlight, and casting shadows appropriate to> their positions, three-storied houses of various shapes and sizes lining both> sides of the road. These houses hung out over the road, which certainly> appeared to be muddy with patches of large cobblestones. The houses were of (I> would say) about the Elizabethan period of England, but for some reason I knew> they were in Paris! They had pent roofs, some with dormer windows, gabled> timbered porticos, and small windows with tiny leaded panes. Here and there,> there were dull reddish lights burning behind them, as if from candles. There> were iron-frame lanterns hanging from timbers jutting from some houses and> they were all swaying together as if in a wind, but there was not the faintest> movement of air about us. I could go on and on describing this scene as it was> so vivid: in fact, I could draw it. But that is not the main point.> > I was marvelling at this, and looking about me, when my wife came to a dead> stop and gave a gasp. I ran smack into her. Then she went speechless for a> time while I begged to know what was wrong. Finally she took my hand and,> pointing, described to me exactly what I was seeing. At which point, I became> speechless.> > Finally pulling myself together, I blurted out something like “What do you> think’s happened?” but my wife’s reply startled me even more. I remember it> only too well: she said, “How did we get to Paris five hundred years ago?”> > We stood marvelling at what we apparently both now saw, picking out individual> items, pointing, questioning each other as to details, and so forth.> Curiously, we found ourselves swaying back and forth, and began to feel very> weak, so I called out to Fred, whose white shirt was fast disappearing ahead.> > I don’t remember what happened then but we tried to run towards him and,> feeling dizzy, sat down on what we were convinced was a tall, rough curbstone.> Fred came running back asking what was wrong but at first we did not know what> to say. He was the “keeper” of the cigarettes, of which we had about half a> dozen left, and he sat down beside us and gave us each one. By the time the> flame from his lighter had cleared from my eyes, so had fifteenth-century> Paris, and there was nothing before me but the endless and damned thorn bushes> and cactus and bare earth. My wife also “came back” after looking into the> flame. Fred had seen nothing, and was completely mystified by our subsequent> babble, but he was not sceptical and insisted that we just sit and wait for> the truck . . .> > When eventually they arrived back home they were surprised to find that theirservant woman had a hot meal waiting for them, and a large bowl of hot water, inwhich she insisted on washing Mrs Sanderson’s feet; the head man had preparedhot baths for Sanderson and Fred Allsop. They would not explain how they knewthat Sanderson and his companions would be back at dawn. But one of the youngmen in the village later said to Sanderson: “You saw things, didn’t you? Youdon’t believe it, but you could always see things if you wanted to.”Sanderson had obviously experienced a kind of “time slip” into the past, andthere are dozens – perhaps hundreds – of other recorded examples, the mostfamous undoubtedly being that of the two English ladies, Eleanor Jourdain andCharlotte Moberly, who in August 1901, walking in the gardens at Versailles,found themselves back in Versailles in 1789, just before the downfall of LouisXVI. Ten years later, their book describing their experience caused a sensationbecause it was so obvious that the two ladies – principals of an Oxford college– were of unquestioned integrity. Professor C.E.M. Joad, speaking about their“adventure”, used the phrase “the undoubted queerness of time”. But he made noattempt to explain the mechanism of “time slips”.In my book Mysteries I record an equally remarkable example, taken directly fromthe person concerned, Mrs Jane O’Neill of Cambridge. In 1973 she was the firstperson to arrive at the scene of a serious accident, and helped injuredpassengers out of the wrecked bus. Later she began to suffer from insomnia, andthe doctor told her this was due to shock. On holiday with a friend in Norfolk,she began experiencing “visions” – sudden vivid pictures that lasted just a fewseconds. After one of these she told her friend, “I have just seen you in thegalleys”, and the friend replied: “That’s not surprising. My ancestors wereHuguenots and were punished by being sent to the galleys.”But the most remarkable event took place on a visit to Fotheringay church. Shestood for some time in front of the picture of the Crucifixion behind the altar.Later, when she commented on it back in the hotel room, her friend asked: “Whatpicture?” A year later, when they revisited the church, the inside seemed quitedifferent from the first visit, and there was no picture behind the altar. Shewrote to Joan Forman, an expert on “time slips”, and through her contacted anantiquarian who was able to tell her that what she had seen had been the churchas it had been before it had been pulled down in 1553.Both Sanderson and Jane O’Neill were convinced that what they were looking atwas real, not a hallucination, although the Sandersons felt dizzy when theytried to run. One of Jane O’Neill’s “visions” was of two figures walking besidea lake, “and I knew, though I don’t know why, that one of them was MargaretRoper”, the daughter of Sir Thomas More. Sanderson and his wife “knew” that theywere looking at fifteenth-century Paris. So it seems clear that the vision wasnot some simple objective hallucination, like a mirage in the desert, but wasdue to some extent to their own minds. Sanderson and his wife presumably sharedit because of some telepathic rapport of the kind that often develops betweenmarried couples. But this fails to explain why they saw Paris in Haiti. (Haitiwas, of course, French, but not until the eighteenth century.)In the mid-nineteenth century a theory of “time slips” was developed by twoAmerican professors, Joseph Rodes Buchanan and William Denton. Through hisexperiments with his students,24[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2238621] Buchanan cameto believe that human beings possess a faculty for “reading” the history ofobjects; he called this “psychometry” (see chapter 43). Denton tested his ownstudents with all kinds of geological specimens, and found that the “sensitive”ones among them saw “mental pictures” that were closely related to the objectthey were holding (and which Denton wrapped in thick brown paper, so they couldhave no idea of what it was). A piece of lava brought “visions” of an explodingvolcano; a fragment of meteor conjured up visions of outer space; a piece ofdinosaur tooth brought visions of primeval forests. Denton was convinced thatall human beings possess this faculty, which he described as “a telescope intothe past”.But while the “time slips” described by Sanderson and Jane O’Neill obviouslyhave much in common with “psychometric” visions, they were unquestionably farmore than mental pictures or impressions. Yet this is not to say that they werenot mental pictures. After her experience of the accident, Jane O’Neill kept on“seeing” the injuries of the passengers; such visions are known as “eideticimagery”. The scientist Nicola Tesla possessed it to such an extent that hecould construct a dynamo in his mind and actually watch it running. Afterexperimenting all day with images of the sun, Isaac Newton found that he couldproduce a visual hallucination of the sun by simply imagining it. Like thestrange abilities of calculating prodigies (see chapter 26), this seems to be afaculty that all human beings possess, but that most of us never learn how touse. We may speculate that Jane O’Neill’s traumatic experience activated thisdormant faculty, and that it somehow continued to operate spasmodically in thesucceeding months. If the image of the sixteenth-century church was some kind of“eidetic image” floating in front of her eyes, there is no reason why she shouldhave recognized it as a hallucination unless she tried to touch the pictureabove the altar; most of us accept the evidence of our senses without question.The same argument probably applies to the experience of Miss Moberly and MissJourdain at Versailles. They saw men and women dressed in the style of Louis XVI(and assumed it was a rehearsal for a costume drama) but naturally, they did nottry to touch them, or even to speak to them. (Being English, they would haverequired an introduction!)Another “time slip” collected by Joan Forman offers us a further clue. MrsTurrell-Clarke, of Wisley-cum-Pyrford in Surrey, was cycling along the modernroad there on her way to evensong when the road suddenly became a field path,and she seemed to be walking along it. She was wearing a nun’s robes, and shesaw a man dressed in the peasant dress of the thirteenth century, who stoodaside to allow her to pass. A month later, sitting in the village church, shesuddenly saw the church change to its original state, with earth floor, stonealtar, lancet windows, and brown-habited monks intoning the same plainsong chantthat was at present being sung by the choir in the “modern” church. At thismoment Mrs Turrell-Clarke felt she was at the back of the church, watching theproceedings. So it seems clear that what happened was that her viewpointchanged, and she found herself looking through someone else’s eyes – the eyes ofa lady walking along the road and the eyes of a woman standing at the back ofthe church. When Jane O’Neill found herself looking at Sir Thomas More’sdaughter walking by a lake she wondered whether there might be some “family”connection, since her own unmarried name was Moore. She may even have suspectedthat she had somehow slipped back into a previous incarnation. Again, it seemsclear that she was seeing the scene through someone else’s eyes – which explainshow she knew that she was looking at Margaret Roper. And since the Sandersonsknew they were looking at fifteenth-century Paris, we may assume that they werealso looking through “someone else’s eyes”.The late T.C. Lethbridge, a retired Cambridge don who devoted the last years ofhis life to studying the paranormal, came to the interesting conclusion that“ghosts” are in fact a kind of “tape recording”: that powerful emotions can“imprint” themselves on some sort of magnetic field, and that these “recordings”can be “picked up” by a person who is sensitive to them – for example, by a gooddowser. (Dowsing involves sensitivity to the electromagnetic field of water.)Lethbridge himself, for example, experienced a strange feeling of foreboding anddepression in a spot where the body of a suicide was concealed in a hollow tree.Joan Forman has also expressed her conviction that time slips “have someconnection with the human electromagnetic field”. She herself was standing inthe courtyard of Haddon Hall in Derbyshire when she saw a group of four childrenplaying on the steps and yelling with laughter. When she took a step forward thegroup vanished, but she later recognized one of the girls in an ancestralpainting that hung on the walls. She also cites the experience of a Norwichteacher, Mrs Anne May, who was leaning against a monolith at the Clava Cairns,near Inverness, when she “saw” a group of men in shaggy tunics andcross-gartered trousers, dragging one of the monoliths over the turf; when agroup of tourists walked into the glade the figures vanished; apparently Mrs Mayhad caught a glimpse of the original bronze-age builders of the monolithiccircle. Joan Forman believes that the contact with the monolith was the “triggerfactor” that caused Mrs May to see her vision, and that in her own case it wasthe spot she was standing on.Most students of the paranormal would admit another possibility: the notion thatwhat is being “contacted” is the mind of someone who lived in the distant past.In 1907 the architect Frederick Bligh Bond was appointed by the Church ofEngland to take charge of the excavations at Glastonbury Abbey. What hisemployers did not know was that Bond was interested in spiritualism. Togetherwith a friend named Bartlett, Bond attempted “automatic writing”, the aim beingto learn where to start digging in the abbey grounds. When they asked aboutGlastonbury the pencil – which they were both holding – wrote: “All knowledge iseternal and is available to mental sympathy”. And soon a communicator who signedhimself Gulielmus Monachus – William the Monk – began giving extremely detailedinstructions on where to excavate, and as a result Bond unearthed two chapels,each of precisely the dimensions given by William the Monk. Another“communicator”, Johannes, made the following interesting remark:> Why cling I to that which is not? It is I, and it is not I, butt parte of me> which dwelleth in the past and is bound to that whych my carnal self loved and> called “home” these many years. Yet I, Johannes, amm of many partes, and ye> better parte doeth other things . . . only that part which remembereth> clingeth like memory to what it seeth yet.> > Bond’s downfall came when he wrote a book describing how he had obtained theinformation that had made his excavations so successful; the Church of Englanddismissed him. But the book, Gate of Remembrance, remains an astonishing proofthat a twentieth-century mind can apparently attain some kind of direct accessto the past. “All knowledge is eternal and is available to mental sympathy”. Andthe comments of Johannes seem to imply that a “parte of me which dwelleth in thepast . . . clingeth like memory to what it seeth yet”. It seems, therefore,remotely possible that some “time slips” may involve contact with a mind “whichdwelleth in the past”.Many writers describing time slips mention an odd sense of “crossing athreshold”. When Miss Jourdain returned alone to Versailles a few months afterher “adventure” with Miss Moberly she suddenly felt “as if I had crossed a lineand was in a circle of influence”, and saw oddly dressed labourers in brighttunics. A girl named Louisa Hand told Joan Forman how, when she was a child, shehad entered her grandmother’s cottage, and been puzzled to find herself in aplace with older furniture. Thinking she had entered the wrong place, she wentout to check, then went back in; still the room was different. But when she wentin a third time things had returned to normal. She also mentioned the sensationof “crossing a threshold”, and of a feeling of silence associated with it.It would seem, then, that the “psychometric” theory of Buchanan and Denton couldaccount for the time-slip phenomenon. But this is far from the truth. It is alsopossible to “slip” the other way, into the future. Joan Forman cites the case ofa teacher from Holt, Norfolk, who while involved in a “traffic contretemps” inthe town noticed that a launderette that had been under construction was nowfinished and in use. He told his wife, who went there the next day with a bag ofsoiled laundry, and found that the place was still half-finished. The teacherhad seen the shop as it would be in six weeks’ time.Most of the cases of “future visions” cited in The Mask of Time are involvedwith dreams. In 1927 J.W. Dunne’s book An Experiment With Time, with its studyof “precognitive dreams”, caused a sensation. Dunne described a number ofoccasions on which he had dreamt of events that he would read about later in thenewspapers. T.C. Lethbridge later had much the same experience; he carefullyobserved his dreams, and noticed how often he dreamt of some trivial event ofthe next day; for example, he woke up dreaming of the face of a man he did notknow; the face seemed to be enclosed in a kind of frame, and the man was makingmovements with his hands in the area of his chin, as if soaping his face priorto shaving. The next day, driving along a country road, he saw the face of theman of his dream; he was behind the windscreen of an oncoming car – the “frame”– and his hands were moving on the steering wheel, which was directly under hischin. Joan Forman cites many similar cases. All tend to have the same “trivial”quality, as if the glimpse of the future is some kind of freak accident. Oneschoolteacher, lying in bed with a high temperature, had an odd hallucinationinvolving hedgehogs walking round the bedroom floor, and building a high nestwith sticks and straw. Three months later he was packing ceramic figures made byhis pottery class to take them to the kiln; he packed them in a kind of layerednest, with straw between the layers. Several ceramic hedgehogs were on the flooraround his feet. Suddenly he recognized his hallucination. Just before he beganthe packing operation, he experienced a feeling of “a peculiar mechanicalinevitability”.An Oxford scientist, Michael Shallis, has written a book on the nature oftime,25 [CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2238802] in thecourse of which he mentions two of his own odd experiences of “prevision”. As atwelve-year-old boy he went into the house one day and called out to ask hismother what they were having for dinner. As he did so he experienced a feelingof déja vu, and knew that his mother would reply that they were having salad fordinner which she did.This kind of “prevision” is fairly common. Joan Forman quotes a letter shereceived from a man who often knew with absolute certainty that a cricketerwould be bowled out before the ball left the bowler’s hand; he comments thatthis often annoyed the batsman, who felt that he had somehow caused it. Oneexplanation for such an ability might be some kind of unconscious “computer”that swiftly assessed the whole situation – the stance of the batsman, the skillof the bowler – and “saw” that the loss of the wicket was inevitable. Butanother experience cited by Shallis suggests that the problem is rather morecomplex than this.> A few years ago I was teaching a student physics in an upstairs lecture room.> I had reached the part of the tutorial where we were discussing radioactive> half lives and I was again swamped with the deja-vu feeling. I knew I was> going to suggest that I needed to show him some examples from a certain book> in my office and then go and collect it. I resisted saying this to him, but> the feeling it had all happened before was strong. I was determined to break> the pattern of the event. I turned to my student and asked him if we had done> this work before, believing that he might be sharing the experience. He looked> puzzled and replied no. I struggled to avoid continuing the experience. I> resolved not to go and fetch the book. Having made that resolution I turned> again to the student and said: “I think I had better show you some examples of> these. I will just pop down to my room and get a book”. My awareness of the> experience itself did not make it go away, even when I tried not to repeat its> pre-set pattern.> > There is an alarming implication in the words “repeat its pre-set pattern”. Isit possible that we do what we “have” to do, whether we want to or not, and thatour sense of free will is a delusion? Shallis goes on to say:> There is an element of precognition itself in the experience, because the> situation is so “familiar” that one knows what will happen next. It is> different from precognition, however, in that it is familiar; one is in a> sense reliving a part of one’s life, not predicting or sensing a remote event.> > J.W. Dunne’s explanation for such experiences involves what he calls “serialtime”. Basically, he is suggesting that there are several “times”. When we say“time flows”, it means we are measuring it against something. That somethingmust be another kind of time, “time number two”. And this in turn could bemeasured against “time number three”. We also have several “selves”. Self numberone is stuck in time number one; but we have another self which is not thephysical body, which can rise above self number one and foresee the future.In his book Man and Time, J.B. Priestley tells a story that seems to illustratethe difference between the two selves. A young mother dreamed that on a campingholiday she left her young son by the river while she went off to get the soap,and that when she came back he was drowned. On a camping holiday some time latershe was about to go off and get the soap when she suddenly recognized the sceneof her dream; so she tucked the baby under her arm before she went off to thetent . . .The implication here is important. We do possess a degree of free will, but itis hard to exercise in the material world of “time number one”. It is likeswimming against the current. Our human problem is not to remain stuck in “timenumber one”, the material world, with its repetitious futility, but to learn tospend as much time as possible in the mental world, the world of “time numbertwo”.Priestley argues that Dunne is making things unnecessarily complicated inarguing for an infinite number of selves; according to Priestley, there are onlythree. Self number one is simply involved in living; it might say, for example:“I feel depressed.” Self number two says: “I know self number one is depressed.”Self three says: “I know self two knows self one is depressed. But then, selfone is a self-indulgent idiot.” Self one experiences; self two is conscious ofexperience; self three passes judgment on the experience. Priestley gives anexample; in a plane accident, self one was hurled out of his seat; self two knewthere was about to be an accident. Self three thought: “Now I shall know whatit’s like to be fried alive.” It “does not really care; it is as if it goesalong with the other two just for the ride.”This is perhaps one of the most interesting and important observations to arisefrom these speculations about the nature of time; the experience of what seemsto be a “higher self”. In his important book A Drug-Taker’s Notes, R.H. Warddescribes his experience under dental gas:> . . . I passed, after the first few inhalations of the gas, directly into a> state of consciousness already far more complete than the fullest degree of> ordinary waking consciousness, and that I then passed progressively upwards .> . . into finer and finer degrees of heightened awareness. But although one> must write of it in terms of time, time had no place in the experience. In one> sense it lasted far longer than the short period between inhaling the gas and> “coming round”, lasted indeed for an eternity, and in another sense it took no> time at all.> > Ward’s observation here emphasizes that the nature of time is essentiallymental. It might almost be said that the sense of time is produced by the stressbetween the physical world and the “higher self”, and that when this stressvanishes there is a sense of timelessness. The stress vanishes as a result of awithdrawal inward, as if towards another level of reality inside us, an innerworld with its own reality. Ward says that when he later tried to recall theessence of his experience he found himself repeating “Within and within andwithin . . .” like a recurring decimal.He also quotes from the experience of a friend he calls A, who was on his wayback from the station when he experienced mild indigestion. The thought occurredto him> It belongs only to my body and is real only to the physical not-self. There is> no need for the self to feel it . . . Even as I thought this the pain> disappeared; that is, it was in some way left behind . . . the sensation of> “rising up within” began . . . First there is the indescribable sensation in> the spine, as of something mounting up, a sensation which is partly pleasure> and partly pleasure and partly awe . . . This is accompanied by an> extraordinary feeling of bodily lightness, of well-being and effortlessness .> . . Everything was becoming “more”, everything was going up to another level.> > Here it sounds as if A’s “self number three” had decided to actively intervene,and the result was a sense of leaving the pain behind.If there is any general conclusion to be drawn from these experiences of the“undoubted queerness of time”, it is this: that we are somehow mistaken in ournatural and very understandable assumption that the physical world is the basicand perhaps the only reality. Experiences of “time slips” and of precognitionsuggests that when the mind can slip into another “gear” it escapes its normalenslavement to time, and achieves a state of serene detachment “above” time.The puzzling thing about such a notion is its implication that time is somehowunreal, or at least less real than we take it to be. Common sense and scienceare in agreement that the future cannot be predicted with any precision becauseit has not yet happened. Every “cause” in the world of the present moment couldhave many different effects. When a gas is heated its molecules begin to movefaster, and an increasing number of collisions will occur. Each of thesecollisions causes the molecules to change course, and so leads to a differentset of collisions. So it would be virtually impossible to determine whichmolecules will be colliding with others in ten minutes’ time; everything dependsupon chance. In the same way, the five billion or so people in the world at thepresent moment will interact in unpredictable ways, and will determine what ishappening in a week from now. In the case of the gas molecules, a sufficientlycomplex computer could in theory predict what will be happening a week from now;but no computer could make similar predictions about people.Experiences of time slips and of precognition contradict this assertion. Theyclearly imply that in some sense the future is to some extent predetermined, asif it had already happened. This is, in fact, precisely what the materialistwould assert. Free will is an illusion; therefore human beings obey mechanicallaws. Yet apparently this cannot be entirely true, or Priestley’s mother wouldnot have been able to prevent her baby from drowning. In fact, the veryexistence of precognition means that the future cannot be entirely determined,for to know the future in advance is to be able, to some extent, to alter it.Even though Michael Shallis obeyed his compulsion to go to look for the book, hehad nevertheless made an effort not to do so – thereby revealing that he was notcompletely “determined”. (And, presumably, he would have been able to overcomethe compulsion if he had felt strongly enough about it – for example, if hissense of déja-vu had warned him that he would meet with a serious accident onhis way to his office.)It is a disconcerting thought: that life is somehow basically “scripted”. Butwhat seems to be more important is the recognition that, with the right kind ofeffort, we can depart from the “script”. Priestley takes issue with ProfessorGilbert Ryle’s view – in The Concept of Mind – that man is merely a living body,not a body controlled by a self or soul. Ryle calls this view “the ghost in themachine”. Experiences of “time in disarray” seems to support Priestley andcontradict Ryle: in fact, to confirm the view that we have at least three“selves” as distinct from the physical body, and that the third of these selvescorresponds roughly to what Kant (and Husserl) meant by the “transcendentalego”, or “the self that presides over consciousness”."},{"pageContent":"56 The Great Tunguska ExplosionOn 30 June 1908 the inhabitants of Nizhne-Karelinsk, a small village in centralSiberia, saw a bluish-white streak of fire cut vertically across the sky to thenorth-west. What began as a bright point of light lengthened over a period oftenminutes until it seemed to split the sky in two. When it reached the ground itshattered to form a monstrous cloud of black smoke. Seconds later there was aterrific roaring detonation that made the buildings tremble. Assuming that theDay of Judgment had arrived, many of the villagers fell on their knees. Thereaction was not entirely absurd; in fact, they had witnessed the greatestnatural disaster in the earth’s recorded history. If the object that caused whatis now known as “the Great Siberian Explosion” had arrived a few hours earlieror later it might have landed in more heavily populated regions, and causedmillions of deaths.As it later turned out, the village of Nizhne-Karelinsk had been over 200 milesaway from the “impact point”, and yet the explosion had been enough to shakedebris from their roofs. A Trans-Siberian express train stopped because thedriver was convinced that it was derailed; and seismographs in the town ofIrkutsk indicated a crash of earthquake proportions. Both the train and the townwere over 800 miles from the explosion.Whatever it was that struck the Tunguska region of the Siberian forestland hadexploded with a force never before imagined. Its shock-wave travelled around theglobe twice before it died out, and its general effect on the weather in thenorthern hemisphere was far-reaching. During the rest of June it was quitepossible to read the small print in the London Times at midnight. There werephotographs of Stockholm taken at one o’clock in the morning by natural light,and a photograph of the Russian town of Navrochat taken at midnight looks like abright summer afternoon.For some months the world was treated to spectacular dawns and sunsets, asimpressive as those that had been seen after the great Krakatoa eruption in1883. From this, as well as the various reports of unusual cloud formations overfollowing months, it is fair to guess that the event had thrown a good deal ofdust into the atmosphere, as happens with violent volcanic eruptions and,notably, atomic explosions.Perhaps the strangest aspect of the Great Siberian Explosion was that no onepaid much attention to it. Reports of the falling object were published inSiberian newspapers but did not spread any further. Meteorologists speculatedabout the strange weather, but no one came close to guessing its real cause.It was not until the Great War had been fought, and the Russian Revolution hadoverthrown the tsarist regime that the extraordinary events of that June dayfinally reached the general public. In 1921, as part of Lenin’s general plan toplace the USSR at the forefront of world science, the Soviet Academy of Sciencescommissioned Leonid Kulik to investigate meteorite falls on Soviet territory. Itwas Kulik who stumbled upon the few brief reports in ten-year-old Siberiannewspapers that finally led him to suspect that something extraordinary hadhappened in central Siberia in the summer of 1908.Leonid found the reports confusing and contradictory. None of them seemed toagree quite where the object had exploded. Some even claimed that the “meteor”had later been found. But when his researchers began to collect eyewitnessreports of the event Kulik became convinced that whatever had exploded in theTunguska forest was certainly not a normal meteorite.These reports described how the ground had opened up to release a great pillarof fire and smoke which burned brighter than the sun. Distant huts were blowndown and reindeer herds scattered. A man ploughing in an open field felt hisshirt burning on his back, and others described being badly sunburnt on one sideof the face but not the other. Many people claimed to have been made temporarilydeaf by the noise, or to have suffered long-term effects of shock. Yet, almostunbelievably, not a single person had been killed or seriously injured. Whateverit was that produced the explosion had landed in one of the few places on earthwhere its catastrophic effect was minimized. A few hours later, and it couldhave obliterated St Petersburg, London or New York. Even if it had landed in thesea, tidal waves might have destroyed whole coastal regions. That day the humanrace had escaped the greatest disaster in its history, and had not even beenaware of it.Finally Kulik discovered that a local meteorologist had made an estimate of thepoint of impact, and in 1927 he was given the necessary backing by the Academyof Sciences to find the point where the “great meteorite” had fallen.The great Siberian forest is one of the least accessible places on earth. Eventoday it remains largely unexplored, and there are whole areas that have onlyever been surveyed from the air. What settlements there are can be found alongthe banks of its mighty rivers, some of them miles in width. The winters areferociously cold, and in the summer the ground becomes boggy, and the air isfilled with the hum of mosquitoes. Kulik was faced with an almost impossibletask: to travel by horse and raft with no idea of exactly where to look or whatto look for.In March 1927 he set off accompanied by two local guides who had witnessed theevent, and after many setbacks arrived on the banks of the Mekirta river inApril. The Mekirta is the closest river to the impact point, and in 1927 formeda boundary between untouched forest and almost total devastation.On that first day Kulik stood on a low hill and surveyed the destruction causedby the Tunguska explosion. For as far as he could see to the north – perhaps adozen miles – there was not one full-grown tree left standing. Every one hadbeen flattened by the blast, and they lay like a slaughtered regiment, allpointing towards him. Yet it was obvious that what he was looking at was only afraction of the devastation, since all the trees were facing in the samedirection as far as the horizon. The blast must have been far greater than eventhe wildest reports had suggested.Kulik wanted to explore the devastation; his two guides were terrified, andrefused to go on. So Kulik was forced to return with them, and it was not untilJune that he managed to return with two new companions.The expedition followed the line of broken trees for several days until theycame to a natural amphitheatre in the hills, and pitched camp there. They spentthe next few days surveying the surrounding area, and Kulik reached theconclusion that “the cauldron” as he called it, was the centre of the blast. Allaround, the fallen trees faced away from it, and yet, incredibly, some treesactually remained standing although stripped and charred, at the very centre ofthe explosion.The full extent of the desolation was now apparent; from the river to itscentral point was a distance of thirty-seven miles. So the blast had flattenedmore than four thousand square miles of forest.Still working on the supposition that the explosion had been caused by a largemeteorite, Kulik began searching the area for its remains. He thought he hadachieved his object when he discovered a number of pits filled with water – henaturally assumed that they had been made by fragments of the explodingmeteorite. Yet when the holes were drained they were found to be empty. One evenhad a tree-stump at the bottom, proving it had not been made by a blast.Kulik was to make four expeditions to the area of the explosion, and until hisdeath he remained convinced that it had been caused by an unusually largemeteorite. Yet he never found the iron or rock fragments that would provide himwith the evidence he needed. In fact, he never succeeded in proving thatanything had even struck the ground. There was evidence of two blast waves – theoriginal explosion and the ballistic wave – and even of brief flash fire; butthere was no crater.The new evidence only deepened the riddle. An aerial survey in 1938 showed thatonly 770 square miles of forest had been flattened, and that at the very pointwhere the crater should have been the original trees were still standing. Thatsuggested the vagaries of an exploding bomb, rather than that of the impact of agiant meteor – like the one that made the 600-foot-deep crater at Winslow,Arizona.Even the way that the object fell to earth was disputed. Over seven hundredeyewitnesses claimed that it changed course as it fell, saying that it wasoriginally moving towards Lake Baikal before it swerved. Falling heavenly bodieshave never been known to do this, nor is it possible to explain how it couldhave happened in terms of physical dynamics.Another curious puzzle about the explosion was its effect on the trees andinsect life in the blast area. Trees that had survived the explosion had eitherstopped growing, or were shooting up at a greatly accelerated rate. Laterstudies revealed new species of ants and other insects which are peculiar to theTunguska blast region.It was not until some years after Kulik’s death in a German prisoner-of-war campthat scientists began to see similarities between the Tunguska event and anothereven more catastrophic explosion: the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki withthermonuclear devices.Our knowledge of the atom bomb enables us to clear up many of the mysteries thatbaffled Kulik. The reason there was no crater was that the explosion had takenplace above the ground, as with an atomic bomb. The standing trees at thecentral point of the explosion confirmed this; at both Nagasaki and Hiroshima,buildings directly beneath the blast remained standing, because the blast spreadsideways. Genetic mutations in the flora and fauna around the Japanese citiesare like those witnessed in Siberia, while blisters found on dogs and reindeerin the Tunguska area can now be recognized as radiation burns.Atomic explosions produce disturbances in the earth’s magnetic field, and eventoday the area around the Tunguska explosion has been described as “magneticchaos”. It seems clear that an electro-magnetic “hurricane” of incrediblestrength has ruptured the earth’s magnetic field in this area.Eye-witness accounts of the cloud produced by the explosion again support theview that it was some kind of atomic device; it had the typical shape of theatomic “mushroom cloud”. Unfortunately, the one conclusive piece of evidence forthe “atom bomb” theory is lacking: by the time the area’s radiation levels weretested, more than fifty years later, they were normal.Later investigators also learned that Kulik had been mistaken in his theoryabout the water-filled holes; they were not caused by meteorite fragments but bywinter ice forcing its way to the surface through expansion, then melting insummer. Kulik’s immense labours to drain the holes had been a waste of time.Unfortunately, none of the new evidence that has been uncovered by Russian – andeven American – expeditions has thrown any light on the cause of the explosion.UFO enthusiasts favour the theory that the object was an alien space craft,powered by atomic motors, which went out of control as it struck the earth’satmosphere. It has even been suggested that such a space craft might have headedtowards Lake Baikal because it was in need of fresh water to cool its nuclearreactors; before it could reach its objective the reactors superheated andexploded.The scientific establishment is naturally inclined to discount this theory aspure fantasy. But some of its own hypotheses seem equally fantastic. A.A.Jackson and M.P. Ryan of the University of Texas have suggested that theexplosion was caused by a miniature black hole – a kind of whirlpool in spacecaused by the total collapse of the particles inside the atom. They calculatedthat their black hole would have passed straight through the earth and come outon the other side, and the Russians were sufficiently impressed by the theory toresearch local newspapers in Iceland and Newfoundland for June 1980; but therewas no sign of the Tunguska-like catastrophe that should have occurred ifJackson and Ryan were correct.Other American scientists suggested that the explosion was caused by antimatter,a hypothetical type of matter whose particles contain the opposite electriccharge to those of normal matter. In contact with normal matter, anti-matterwould explode and simply disappear. Only atomic radiation would be left behind.But there is even less evidence to support this theory than there is for theblack-hole explanation.Slightly more plausible – but still highly improbable – is the theory of theEnglish scientist Frank Whipple that the earth had been struck by a comet.Astronomers still have no idea where comets originate, or how they are formed.The two chief objections to the comet theory are that it would be unlikely toproduce a “nuclear” explosion, and that it would have been observed byastronomers long before it reached the earth. Supporters of the comet theoryhave pointed out that a comet coming in from the direction of the sun might bevery hard to detect, and that the explosion of a comet might produce an effectsimilar to that of solar flares, which produce radio-activity. But none of the120 observatories questioned by the Russians have any record of a comet on thetrajectory of the Tunguska object.More recently, it has been pointed out that the Tunguska event took place on 30June and that on that same day each year the earth’s orbit crosses that of ameteor stream called Beta Taurids, producing a “meteor shower”. If one of thesemeteors had been exceptionally large, it could have survived burning up in theearth’s atmosphere, and as its super-heated exterior reacted against its frozeninterior, it would have shattered like molten glass suddenly plunged intofreezing water. If this theory is correct, then it seems that Kulik was rightafter all. But that only reminds us that Kulik was unable to find the slightestshred of evidence for his theory. Eight decades after it took place, it seemsincreasingly unlikely that the mystery of the Tunguska explosion will ever besolved.Postscript to The Great Tunguska Explosion Since this article was written, new research has suggested that the “Tunguskaobject” was almost certainly a small comet or meteor, and not, as some havesuggested, an exploding space craft, or even a miniature black hole. A cometseems less likely than a meteor, since comets travel relatively slowly, andwould surely have been seen approaching the earth. Professor Alexis Zolotov (theleader of the 1959 expedition to Tunguska) calculated that, whatever the objectwas, it was about 130 feet in diameter, and exploded about three miles above theground with a force of 40 megatons, 2,000 times greater than the atomic bomb atHiroshima."},{"pageContent":"57 Unidentified Flying Objects“Flying Saucers” have undoubtedly been the great mystery of the era thatfollowed the Second World War, and theories to explain them have ranged from thebelief that they are superior beings from another planet (or another dimension)to the suggestion that they are some kind of supernatural occurrence, allied toghosts. Among intellectuals the most popular theory is that of Jung, whosuggested that UFOs (unidentified flying objects) are “projections” of theunconscious mind, which is a polite, scientific way of saying that they have nomore objective reality than the pink elephants of a dipsomaniac. But most ofthese Jungians choose to ignore – or are unaware of – Jung’s later retraction ofthis view; he told his niece not long before his death that he had come toaccept that UFOs are real objects.The story of modern sightings began on 24 June 1947 when a businessman namedKenneth Arnold was flying his private plane near Mount Rainier in WashingtonState; against the background of the mountain, he saw nine shining discstravelling very fast – he estimated their speed at a thousand miles an hour, farbeyond the speed of which any aircraft was capable at that time. Arnold saidthey were flying in formation, like geese, and that they wove in and out of themountain peaks; he later compared their flight to a “saucer skipped across thewater”. So UFOs came to be referred to as “flying saucers”.Arnold’s story was widely reported in the American Press, for he had a goodreputation and was taken seriously – he had been out searching for the wreckageof a lost plane at the time he made the sighting, and obviously had no reason toinvent such a story. Four days later, two pilots and two intelligence officerssaw a bright light performing “impossible manoeuvres” over Maxwell Air ForceBase in Montgomery, Alabama, and in Nevada on the same day another pilot saw aformation of “unidentified flying objects”. As these and other sightings werereported the Press began to give prominence to stories of flying saucers, and bythe end of that year there had been hundreds of sightings – a number that soongrew into thousands.In January of the following year, 1948, an “unidentified object” was spotted inthe sky above Godman Air Force Base in Kentucky. Three F-51 Mustangs werediverted from a training exercise to investigate, and one of these, flown byCaptain Thomas Mantell, had soon outdistanced the other two. The radio towerreceived a call: “I see something above and ahead of me – I’m still climbing.”“What is it?” “It looks metallic and is tremendous in size”. Then he announced:“It’s above me and I’m gaining on it. I’m going to twenty thousand feet”. Butthese were the last words Mantell spoke. Later that day the remains of his planewere found ninety miles away from the base.The story was a sensation – “airman destroyed by flying saucer”. The Air Forceannounced that what Mantell had mistaken for a flying saucer was actually theplanet Venus – a story that seemed, to put it mildly, unlikely. But then, theAir Force had shown the same confidence ten days after Arnold’s originalsighting when it had announced that Arnold had been “hallucinating”.It was obvious that the newspaper publicity was causing a certain amount ofhysteria, and that many people thought they had seen flying saucers when theyhad only seen weather balloons or aircraft tail-lights. But was it conceivablethat thousands of people – in fact, millions – could all be mistaken? For by1966, a Gallup Poll revealed that five million Americans had seen flyingsaucers. And some of these sightings were at close quarters. A few days afterArnold’s original sighting, the SS Llandovery Castle sailed from Mombasa enroute to Cape Town. At about eleven one evening a Mrs A.M. King, of Nairobi, wason deck with another woman when they saw what appeared to be a bright starapproaching the ship. Then a searchlight switched on, illuminating the sea aboutfifty yards from the ship. They saw an object made of steel and “shaped like acigar cut at the rear end”. It was about four times as big as the ship, and wastravelling in the same direction; soon it vanished at a great speed, flamesissuing from the “flattened” end.Yet in spite of an increasing number of reports of this type, and thousands of“sky sightings”, the Air Force continued to insist that UFO sightings werehoaxes, mistakes or downright lies. An official investigation, known as “ProjectSign”, began in September 1947, and later became known as “Project Blue Book”.One of its advisers was the astronomer J. Allen Hynek, who began as a skeptic,but was soon convinced by the obvious truthfulness of witnesses that UFOs were areality. But the Air Force remained adamantly skeptical. By the mid-1960s thebelief that it was involved in a cover-up became so persistent that in 1965 theAir Force itself ordered that a new scientific panel should be set up; Edward U.Condon, a well-known physicist, was appointed head of this panel, and it wassponsored by the University of Colorado. But when the panel issued its report in1969 it was obvious that the scientists of the University of Colorado hadreached the same conclusion as the Air Force investigators – one newspaperheadline summarized the findings of the 965-page report in the headline: “FlyingSaucers Do Not Exist – Official”.One basic problem was that many of the sightings were too preposterous to betaken seriously; the whole field of investigation had become a happyhunting-ground for cranks. In a book called Flying Saucers Have Landed aPolish-American named George Adamski claimed that in 1952 he and a number ofother saucer enthusiasts drove into the California desert – their route dictatedby Adamski’s “hunches” – and saw a huge cigar-shaped object in the sky. With acamera, Adamski wandered off alone, and saw a flying saucer land half a mileaway. He hurried to the spot, and found a flying saucer, and a small man withshoulder-length blond hair, who identified himself in sign language as aninhabitant of the planet Venus. Then he flew off in his space craft. His friendshad witnessed the encounter from a distance, and later signed notarizedstatements to this effect. In a second book, Inside the Space Ships, Adamskitold how he had been taken for a trip in a flying saucer – called a “scout ship”– with his Venusian acquaintance, plus a man from Mars and a man from Saturn. Onthis occasion they flew into space and went on board the mother ship. On anotheroccasion Adamski was taken to the moon, where he saw rich vegetation, includingtrees, and four-legged furry animals. He was also shown live pictures of Venuson a television screen, and saw that it had cities, mountains, rivers and lakes.Adamski died in 1965, four years before the moon landings, but three years aftera space probe – Mariner II – had swept past Venus and revealed that it has anatmosphere of sulphuric acid gas, and that the surface is too hot to supportlife. But such small setbacks left Adamski unmoved – he was always able to claimthat a mere space probe was less reliable than real Venusians – and he spent thefinal years of his life happily lecturing to audience of UFO enthusiasts allover the world.Adamski’s friend Dr George Hunt Williamson, who had been one of the witnesses ofAdamski’s original “contact”, achieved a similar celebrity. In a book called TheSaucers Speak, he told of how he had originally made contact with theinhabitants of flying saucers by means of automatic writing, and how later, aradio operator (whom he calls Mr R.) was able to establish direct contact. The“space men” were from the planet Mars, which they called Masar, and theyexplained that the earth was in grave danger of destroying itself. “Good andevil forces are working now. Organization is important for the salvation of yourworld.” These space intelligences had been observing the earth for seventy-fivethousand years, and were now prepared to save the world by revealing all kindsof astonishing secrets about Life, God and the Creator’s place in the DivineScheme. In a book called Secret Places of the Lion Williamson revealed some ofthese secrets – he claimed he had found them in a great library in a lost cityhigh in the mountains of Peru, where a Master teacher, a survivor of the Elders,still lives and works. (This Master is thousands of years old – he lived onearth in the days when giants still roamed the planet.) This library (the authorthanks one of the monks for translating its ancient records) reveals that theStar People came to earth eighteen million years ago (long before man appeared),and ever since then have been helping man to evolve. Their records are held intombs and secret chambers, and one of their spaceships is at present hidden inthe base of the Great Pyramid, which was built 24,000 years ago (and not a mere4,500, as Egyptologists believe). These Star People were continuallyreincarnated as the great leaders and prophets of mankind, so Tiyi, the wife ofthe pharaoh Amenhotep III, later became the Queen of Sheba, Nefertiti, QueenGuinevere (wife of King Arthur) and Joan of Arc, while the Egyptian crown princeSeti became Isaiah, Aristotle, the apostle John and Leonardo da Vinci. TheSecret Places of the Lion is a history of earth according to the ancientrecords, and is admittedly excellent value as historical entertainment. But thereader could be forgiven for thinking that Williamson decided that if Adamskicould get away with it, then so could he . . .In 1960 there appeared in France an extraordinary book called Morning of theMagicians, by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier; it became an instantbest-seller, and was translated into many languages. It discussed various“mysteries” – alchemy, astrology, black magic, mysterious ancient artifacts andthe Great Pyramid – but its main argument is that much “lost knowledge” wasbrought to our planet by visitors from outer space. It discusses, for example,the so-called Piri Reis maps, dating to the sixteenth century, which showAntarctica (although it was not discovered until three centuries later), andalso show a land bridge between Siberia and Alaska – a bridge that vanishedthousands of years ago, giving way to the Bering Strait – and argues that suchmaps prove that the earth must have been surveyed from the air more than twothousand years ago. It is also full of inaccuracies – for example, describingPiri Reis (who was a Turkish pirate who was beheaded in 1554) as an Americannaval officer of the nineteenth century. But it caused widespread excitement,and seemed to justify the increasing number of “ufologists” who believed thatthe “saucers” had been appearing for centuries, and that they are even describedin the Bible (as the fiery chariots of the prophet Ezekiel, for example).But it was in 1967 that the “ancient astronaut theory” finally reached aworldwide audience, in the form of a book called Memories of the Future,translated into English as Chariots of the Gods? (One newspaper serialized itunder the headline “Was God an Astronaut?”) Its author, Erich von Däniken,borrowed liberally – and without acknowledgement – from predecessors likeWilliamson, Bergier and Pauwels, but presented his own “evidence” with a certainindividual panache. His argument consists basically of the assertion thatvarious ancient monuments – the Great Pyramid (naturally), the Easter Islandstatues, the Mexican pyramids, the megaliths of Carnac and Stonehenge – musthave been erected with the aid of space men, because their technology would havebeen beyond the skills of the builders to whom they are attributed. It is fullof misinformation – for example, he manages to multiply the weight of the GreatPyramid by five, and cites “legends” from the Epic of Gilgamesh which are simplynot to be found in that work. Most of his major arguments proved to be faulty.He insists that the Easter Island statues were too big to be erected by natives;but the explorer Thor Heyerdahl persuaded modern Easter Islanders to carve anderect a similar statute in a few weeks. He asserts that the pyramids had to bebuilt by ancient astronauts because the Egyptians had no rope – but pyramidtexts show the use of rope. What Däniken claimed to be a picture of a man takingoff in a space ship on the Palenque funerary tablet in Guatemala was shown byscholars to be a typical Mayan religious inscription, full of their basicsymbols – birds, serpents and so on. He cites the mysterious Nazca lines on theplains of Peru as examples of structures that could only be understood when seenfrom the air, and suggests that they were giant runways for space craft – heeven has a photograph of an aircraft “parking bay”. But the lines are drawn onthe pebbly surface of the desert, and would be instantly blown away if anaircraft tried to land on them. The “parking bay” turned out to be a detail fromthe leg of a bird – its knee – and was hardly large enough to park a bicycle.Däniken insisted that this was a mistake made by an editor; but he has allowedit to stand in subsequent editions of his book.The mistake about the desert surface seems typical of Däniken’s cavalierattitude to facts. Another can be found in Gold of the Gods, where Dänikenoffers a photograph of a skeleton carved out of stone, and wants to know howancient sculptors knew about skeletons in the days before x-rays – overlookingthe fact that every graveyard was full of them. It is also in Gold of the Godsthat Däniken claims to have been taken into an underground city where heexamined a secret library with books made of metal leaves. His companion, hesaid, was an explorer named Juan Moricz. When Moricz flatly denied the wholestory Däniken hastened to concede that he had invented the underground library,but insisted that in Germany authors of popular non-fiction works are permittedto use certain “effects” – that is, to tell lies – provided they are merelyincidental and do not touch the facts . . . And in spite of theseembarrassments, Däniken continued to publish more books, each one of which, heclaimed, helped to establish his astronaut theory beyond all possible doubt.Understandably, then, the increasing flood of books by “ufologists” aroused mostserious investigators to fury or derision.Yet there were notable exceptions. J. Allen Hynek, as we have already observed,was part of Project Blue Book, and the evidence he studied finally convinced himthat, no matter how many cranks, simpletons and downright liars managed toobscure the facts, these facts unequivocally indicated the real existence offlying saucers, and even of “space men”. It was Hynek who coined the phrase“close encounters of the third kind” meaning encounters with grounded saucersand “humanoids” and he begins his chapter on such encounters (in The UFOExperience, A Scientific Enquiry): “We come now to the most bizarre andseemingly incredible aspect of the entire UFOs phenomenon. To be frank, I wouldgladly omit this part if I could without offense to scientific integrity . . .”And he goes on to consider a number of cases which, although they soundpreposterous, were too well-authenticated to be dismissed. One typical case willsuffice.On 11 August 1955 a flying saucer was seen to land in farming country nearKelly-Hopkinsville, Kentucky. An hour later members of the Sutton family werealerted by the barking of the dog to the presence of an intruder near theirfarmhouse, and saw “a small ‘glowing’ man with extremely large eyes, his armsextended over his head”. The two Sutton men fired at him with a rifle andshotgun, and there was a sound “as if I’d shot into a bucket”, and the “spaceman” turned and hurried off. When another visitor appeared at the window therifle was again fired and they ran outside to see if the creature had been hit.As one of them stopped under a low portion of the roof a claw-like hand reacheddown from it and touched his hair. More shots were fired at the creature on theroof, and although it was hit directly it floated down to the ground and hurriedaway. For the next three hours the eleven occupants of the house remained behindbolted doors, frequently seeing the “space men” at the windows. Finally, theyall bolted out of the house, piled into two cars, and drove to the nearestpolice station. Police could find no signs of the spacemen, but as soon as theywere gone the creatures reappeared. The next day a police artist got witnessesto describe what they had seen; the pictures that emerged was of tiny creatureswith round heads and saucer-like eyes, and arms twice as long as their legs.The family was subjected to a great deal of harassment as a result of theirstory; but serious investigators who questioned them had no doubt whatever thatthey were telling the truth.Perhaps the most famous case of a “close encounter of the third kind” was thatof Barney and Betty Hill. In September 1961 they were returning through NewHampshire from a holiday in Canada when they saw a flying saucer apparently inthe process of landing. Two hours later they found themselves thirty-five milesfrom this spot, with no recollection of what had happened in the meantime.Eventually they consulted an expert in amnesia, Dr Benjamin Simon, who placedthem under hypnosis; the Hills then described – independently – what hadhappened. They had been taken aboard the “saucer” by a number of uniformed menwho looked more or less human (Barney said they reminded him of red-haired,round-faced Irishmen), subjected to a number of medical tests or experiments –skin and nail shavings were taken, and Betty Hill had a needle inserted into hernavel – then they were hypnotized and told to forget everything that hadhappened. Allen Hynek himself was later present when Barney Hill was placedunder hypnosis, and was allowed to question him. He ended by being convinced ofthe genuineness of the experience.What has been called the “ultimate in contact stories” happened to AntonioVillas-Boas, a 23-year-old Brazilian farmer. On 15 October 1957, Villas-Boasclaims that he was ploughing his fields when an egg-shaped UFO descended infront of his tractor. He tried to run away, but was grabbed by “humanoids” intight grey overalls and helmets, and carried into the saucer. The space mencommunicated with sounds like yelps or barks. Villas-Boas was stripped naked andwashed, then a blood sample was taken. After this a beautiful naked woman –about 4 foot 6 inches tall – came into the room. She soon induced Villas-Boas tomake love to her, although he says that she had an off-putting way of gruntingat intervals that made him feel he was having intercourse with an animal.Villas-Boas’s story would be an obvious candidate for the “hoax” category butfor one thing. Dr Olavo T. Fontes examined him soon after the “encounter”, andfound that Villas-Boas had been subjected to a very high dose of radiation. Andat the point on his chin where he claimed the needle had been inserted for theblood sample the doctor found two small marks. Villas-Boas’s story is documentedwith convincing details in The Humanoids, edited by Charles Bowen.Like Hynek, the journalist John Keel was also mildly skeptical about flyingsaucers until he tried the unusual expedient of studying the subject instead ofpassing a priori judgements. In 1952 he prepared a radio documentary on thingsseen in the sky, and came to believe that – even then – there had been too manysightings of flying saucers to dismiss them as mistakes or lies. In 1953, inEgypt, he saw his first UFO, a metallic disc with a revolving rim, hovering overthe Aswan dam in daylight. Yet even so, it was not until 1966 that he decided toundertake a careful study of the subject, and subscribed to a press-cuttingbureau. What then staggered him was the sheer number of the sightings – he oftenreceived 150 clippings in a day. (In those days press clippings were only a fewpence each; twenty years later, at about a pound each, the experiment would bebeyond the resources of most journalists.) Moreover, it soon became clear thateven these were only a small percentage of the total, and that thousands ofsightings were going unrecorded. (This is in fact the chief disadvantage of anarticle like this one; it cannot even begin to convey the sheer volume of thesightings. Any skeptic should try the experience of reading, say, a hundredcases, one after the other, to realize that the “delusion” theory fails to holdwater.) What also fascinated Keel was that so many witnesses who had seen UFOsfrom their cars had later seen them over their homes; this suggested that the“space men” were not merely alien scientists or explorers, engaged in routinesurveying work.In the following year, 1967, Keel was driving along the Long Island Expresswaywhen he saw a sphere of light in the sky, pursuing a course parallel to his own.When he reached Huntington he found that cars were parked along the roads, anddozens of people were staring at four lights that were bobbing and weaving inthe sky; the light that had followed Keel joined the other four. Keel was infact on his way to interview a scientist, Phillip Burckhardt, who had seen a UFOhovering above some trees close to his home on the previous evening, and hadexamined it through binoculars; he had seen that it was a silvery discilluminated by rectangular lights that blinked on and off. The nearby SuffolkAir Force Base seemed to know nothing about it.Like Hynek, Keel was impressed by the witnesses he interviewed; most wereordinary people who had no obvious reason for inventing a story about UFOs. Hisstudy of the actual literature convinced him that it was 98 per cent nonsense;but most individual witnesses were obviously telling the truth. Keel had soonaccumulated enough cases to fill a 2000-page typescript; this had to be severelytruncated before it was published under the title UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse.As his investigation progressed, Keel became increasingly convinced that UFOshad been around for thousands of years, and that many biblical accounts of fierychariots or fireballs are probably descriptions of them. In 1883 a Mexicanastronomer named Jose Bonilla photographed 143 circular objects that movedacross the solar disc. In 1878 a Texas farmer named John Martin saw a largecircular object flying overhead, and actually used the word “saucer” in anewspaper interview about it. In 1897 people all over American began sightinghuge airships – cigar-shaped craft. (This was before the man-made airship hadbeen invented.) Dozens of other early “UFO” sightings have been chronicled innewspaper reports or pamphlets; Chapter 26 of Charles Fort’s Book of the Damned– written thirty years before the UFO craze – is devoted to strange objects andlights seen in the sky. One of the most convincing sightings was made by theRussian painter Nicholas Roerich (who designed Stravinsky’s Rite of Springballet); in his book Altai Himalaya (1930) he describes how, making his way fromMongolia to India in 1926, he – and the whole party – observed a big shiny discmoving swiftly across the sky. Like so many modern UFOs, this one suddenlychanged direction above their camp. (In many UFO reports, the object seems todefy the laws of momentum by turning at right angles at great speed.) Itvanished over the mountain peaks.Keel was also interested by the parallels between reports of “space men” anddescriptions by people who claim to have had supernatural experiences. The“angel” that instructed Joseph Smith – founder of the Mormons – to go and digfor engraved gold tablets sounds very like the kind of space visitor describedby Adamski and so many others. During the First World War three children playingin meadows near Fatima, Portugal, saw a shining globe of light, and a woman’svoice spoke from it. (Only two of the three heard it, although all saw it,suggesting that it was in their minds rather than in the objective world.)Crowds began to visit the spot every month where the “Lady of the Rosary” (asshe called herself) appeared to the three children – only the children were ableto see and hear her. But on 13 October 1917, when the Lady had announced thatshe would provide a miracle to convince the world, the rainclouds parted, and ahuge silver disc descended towards the crowd of seventy thousand people. Itwhirled and bobbed – exactly like the UFOs Keel had seen – and changed colourthrough the whole spectrum; all watched it for ten minutes before it vanishedinto the clouds again. Many other people in the area saw it from their homes.The heat from the “object” dried the wet clothes of the crowd. Keel cites thisand other “miracles” (such as one that occurred in Heede, Germany), and arguesthat they sound curiously similar to later UFO accounts.There also seemed to be a more sinister aspect to the UFO affair; witnessesbegan to report that “government officials” had called on them and warned themto be silent; these men were usually dressed in black, although sometimes theywore military uniforms. No government department had – apparently – ever heardof them. Albert K. Bender of Bridgeport, Connecticut, suddenly closed down hisInternational Flying Saucer Bureau in 1953, and declared that three dark-skinnedmen with glowing eyes had pressured him into abandoning his researches. Most UFOenthusiasts blamed the government; but when Bender published his full accountten years later it was obvious that something much stranger was involved; thethree men materialized and dematerialized in his apartment, and on one occasionhad transported him to a UFO base in Antarctica. Jacques Vallee, anotherscientist who had become interested in the UFO phenomenon, noted the similaritybetween this story and medieval legends about fairies and “elementals”.When Keel began to investigate sightings in West Virginia of a huge winged manwho seemed to be able to keep up with fast-moving cars, he himself began toencounter vaguely hostile entities. A photographer took his picture in an emptystreet, then ran away. Just after arranging to meet another UFO expert, GrayBarker, a friend revealed that she had been told about the meeting two days agobefore Keel had even thought of it. “Contactees” would ring him up and explainthat they were with someone who wished to speak to him; then he would haveconversations with men who spoke in strange voices. (He sometimes got thefeeling he was speaking to someone in a trance.) Keel would be instructed towrite letters to addresses which upon investigation proved to be non-existent;yet he would receive prompt replies, written in block letters. On one occasion,he stayed at a motel chosen at random, and found a message waiting for him atthe desk. He says (in The Mothman Prophecies): “Someone somewhere was justtrying to prove that they knew every move I was making, listened to all my phonecalls, and could even control my mail. And they were succeeding”. The entitiesalso made many predictions of the assassination of Martin Luther King, of aplanned attack on Robert Kennedy, of an attempt to stab the pope; but theyfrequently seemed to get the dates wrong. Keel concluded that “our little planetseems to be experiencing the interpenetration of forces or entities from someother space-time continuum”.The British expert on UFOs, Brinsley Le Poer Trench (the Earl of Clancarty),reached a similar kind of conclusion on the basis of his investigations. Heexpresses them (in Operation Earth) as follows:> . . . there exist at least two diametrically opposed forces of entities> interested in us. Firstly, those that are the real Sky People who have been> around since time immemorial. Secondly, those that live in an area indigenous> to this planet, though some of us believe they also live in the interior of> the earth. There is obviously a “War in the Heavens” between these two> factions. However, it is not considered that battles are going on in the sense> that humans usually envisage them. It is more of a mental affray for the> domination of the minds of mankind.> > Jacques Vallee, one of the most serious and intelligent writers on the subject,finally came to a similar conclusion. In earlier books like Anatomy of aPhenomenon and Challenge to Science: The UFO Enigma, he studied case reportswith unusual thoroughness (and many statistical tables). In Passport to Magonia(1970) he pointed out that the picture we can form of the world of the UFOoccupants is more like the mediaeval concept of Magonia, a land above theclouds, than some inhabited planet. By 1977 he had come to the strangeconclusion that UFOs are basically “psychic” in nature, a view he expressed in abook called The Invisible College. The invisible college is a group ofscientists who are engaged in the study of UFO phenomena, and who decline to beintimidated by conservative scientific attitudes. Vallee, himself a computerexpert, reached the conclusion that UFO phenomena are a “control system” – thatis, that they are designed to produce a certain specific effect on the humanmind. He explains in Messengers of Deception (1979): that after a yearresearching the similarity between UFO phenomena and psychic phenomena “I couldno longer regard the ‘flying saucers’ as simply some sort of spacecraft ormachine, no matter how exotic its propulsion”. He went back to his computers,and concluded: “The most clear result was that the phenomenon behaved like aconditioning process. The logic of conditioning uses absurdity and confusion toachieve its goal while hiding its mechanism. I began to see a similar structurein the UFO stories”.Absurdity and confusion are certainly one of the most puzzling and irritatingaspects of the UFO stories. Vallee devotes a chapter of The Invisible College tostudying the case of Uri Geller. Geller, the Israeli psychic and “metal-bender”,was “discovered” by the scientist Andrija Puharich. Geller’s powers aroused suchworldwide interest that it seemed inevitable that the first full-length bookabout him would become a bestseller. In fact Puharich’s Uri: A Journal of theMystery of Uri Geller (1974) came close to destroying Puharich’s reputation as aserious investigator. It seems to be full of baffling confusions andpreposterous and inexplicable happenings. Yet it also provides some vital cluesto the mystery of “space intelligences”. In 1952, long before he met Geller,Puharich was studying with a Hindu psychic named Dr Vinod when Vinod went into atrance and began to speak with an English voice; this trance-entity announceditself as a member of “the Nine”, superhuman intelligences who had been studyingthe human race for thousands of years, and whose purpose is to aid humanevolution. Three years later, travelling in Mexico, Puharich met an Americandoctor who also passed on lengthy messages from “space intelligences” – the oddthing being that they were a continuation of the messages that had come throughDr Vinod. When Puharich met Geller in 1971 the “Nine” again entered the story;while Geller was in a trance a voice spoke out of the air above his headexplaining that Geller had been programmed by “space intelligences” from the ageof three – the aim being to prevent the human race from plunging itself intocatastrophe. Puharich goes on to describe UFO sightings, and an endless seriesof baffling events, with objects appearing and disappearing and recorded tapesbeing mysteriously “wiped”. Puharich assured the present writer (CW) that he hadleft out some of the more startling items because they would be simply beyondbelief.After Puharich’s break with Geller, the “Nine” continued to manifest themselvesthrough mediums. The story is told in Prelude to a Landing on Planet Earth byStuart Holroyd, and it is even more confusing than Puharich’s book. The “Nine”finally sent Puharich and his companions on a kind of wild-goose chase aroundthe Middle East and other remote places; the main purpose was apparently to prayfor peace, and the “intelligences” assured them that they had averted appallinginternational catastrophes.In fact, the mention of mediums may provide a key to the mystery. Modernspiritualism began in the mid-nineteenth century, when “spirits” began toexpress themselves through the mediumship of two teenage girls named Fox; soonthousands of “mediums” were causing mysterious rapping noises (one knock foryes, two for no), making trumpets and other musical instruments float throughthe air and apparently play themselves, and producing spirit voices – and evenspirit forms – by going into a trance. No one who has studied the phenomena indepth can believe that they were all fraudulent. Moreover, the theory that theywere somehow produced by the unconscious minds of the participants must also bereluctantly dismissed, since in many cases “spirits” were able to use different“mediums” in order to reveal fragments of the same message – fragments whichinterlocked like a jigsaw puzzle.But what soon becomes equally clear to any student of the subject is that the“spirits” cannot be taken at their own valuation. As often as not, they toldlies. Emanuel Swedenborg, the eighteenth-century visionary, warned that thereare basically two varieties of spirit, a “higher order” and a “lower order”. Apsychiatrist, Wilson Van Dusen, who studied hundreds of cases of hallucinationsat the Mendocino State Hospital in California, noted that “the patients felt asif they had contact with another world or order of beings. Most thought theseother persons were living. All objected to the term ‘hallucination’”. And henoted that the hallucinations seemed to fall into Swedenborg’s two categories:“helpful” spirits (about one-fifth of all cases), and distinctly unhelpfulspirits whose aim seemed to be to cause the patients misery, irritation andanguish.It is, of course, a major step for any normal, rational person to accept thereal existence of disembodied spirits, or “discarnates”. Yet anyone who iswilling to study the evidence patiently and open-mindedly will undoubtedlyarrive at that conclusion. In fact, anyone who has ever tried automatic writingor the ouija board or “table turning” has probably reached the conclusion thatthere are “intelligences” that are capable of manifesting through human beings.But the question of the precise nature of these entities is altogether morebaffling. It seems clear that some can be taken seriously, others not. Many seemto behave like the traditional demons of the Middle Ages, telling whatever liehappens to enter their heads on the spur of the moment. Some of these“intelligences” – known as poltergeists – can even manifest their presence bycausing objects to fly around the room, or causing mysterious bangs and crashes.One interesting characteristic of the poltergeist is that it can cause an objecttravelling at high speed to change direction quite abruptly, in defiance of theNewtonian laws of motion. This also seems to be one of the characteristics ofthe flying saucer.Jacques Vallee was intrigued by the number of cases in which UFOs behaved in amanner that contradicted the notion that they were simply the artifacts of somesuperior civilization; some have dissolved into thin air; some have vanishedinto the earth; some have expanded like balloons, then disappeared. Some“spacemen” seem to have the power of reading thoughts and of predicting eventswhich will occur in the future. Many of them like Puharich’s “Nine” insist thattheir purpose is to prepare the human race for some astonishing event, like alanding of UFOs on earth; but the landing never seems to occur.Yet it may be simplistic to believe that UFOs are simply an up-dated version ofmedieval demons or nineteenth-century “spirit communicators”. Vallee’s belief isthat the phenomenon is “heuristic” that is, is designed to teach us something.Modern science and philosophy have accustomed us to materialistic theories ofthe universe, to the notion that living creatures are a billion-to-one accident,and that the human reality is simply the reality of our bodies and brains. InFlying Saucers, A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies, Jung suggested thatUFOs may be modern man’s response to his craving for religious meanings, andVallee seems to accept at least the basic implication of this theory. Like Jung,he also seems to believe that coincidences may be more than they seem. InMessengers of Deception, he describes his interest in a modern religious cultcalled the Order of Melchizedek, which believes that its basic doctrines havebeen received through extra-terrestrial intelligences. Then, as noted in chapter54, he began collecting all he could find about the biblical prophetMelchizedek. In February 1976 he asked a female taxi-driver in Los Angeles for areceipt; when he looked at the receipt it was signed “M. Melchizedek”. He lookedup Melchizedek in the Los Angeles phone directory; there was only one . . .This leads Vallee to an interesting speculation about the underlying reality ofthe world. He points out that we are confined to our space-time continuum, andall our concepts of knowledge are based on space and time. So in a library our“information retrieval system” is based on alphabetical order. But moderncomputer scientists have developed another method; they “sprinkle the recordsthroughout storage as they arrive, and . . . construct an algorithm forretrieval based on some type of keyword . . .” He concluded: “The Melchizedekincident . . . suggested to me that the world may be organized more like arandomized data base than a sequential library”. In a computer “library”, thestudent enters a request for “microwave” or “headache” and finds twenty articlesthat he never even suspected had existed. Vallee had entered a request forMelchizedek, and some psychic computer had asked: “How about this one?”In The Flying Saucer Vision (1967), the English writer John Michell also takeshis starting-point from Jung. Michell accepts Jung’s view that the UFOphenomenon is somehow connected with the “religious vacuum” in the soul ofmodern man. He associates UFOs with ancient legends about gods who descend inairships, and his conclusions are not dissimilar to those of von Däniken,although rather more convincingly argued. But Michell also has an originalcontribution to make to “ufology”. In his researches he had stumbled upon AlfredWatkins’s book The Old Straight Track (1925), in which Watkins argues that thecountryside is intersected with ancient straight trackways which wereprehistoric trade routes, and that these tracks connect “sacred sites” such aschurches, stone circles, barrows and tumuli. Watkins called these “ley lines”.Michell argues that the ley lines are identical with lines that the Chinese call“dragon paths” or lung mei. The Chinese science of feng shui, or geomancy, isbasically a religious system concerned with the harmony between man and nature;it regards the earth as a living body. Lung mei are lines of force on theearth’s surface, and one of the aims of feng shui is to preserve and concentratethis force, and prevent it from leaking away. Michell was mistaken to state thatlung mei are straight lines, like Watkins’ leys – in fact, the Chinese regardstraight lines with suspicion; the essential quality of lung meis is that theyare crooked. But Michell takes an important step beyond Watkins in regarding leylines as lines of some earth force; he believes that ancient man selected spotsin which there was a high concentration of this force as their sacred sites.Points where two or more ley lines cross have a special significance. Michellalso points out that many sightings of flying saucers occur on ley lines, andparticularly on their points of intersection – for example, Warminster, inWiltshire, where a truly extraordinary number of sightings have been made. In abook called The Undiscovered Country, Stephen Jenkins, another seriousinvestigator of such matters, points out how often crossing-points of ley linesare associated with all kinds of “supernatural” occurrences, from ghosts andpoltergeists to strange visions of phantom armies. Once again we seem to have aninteresting link between UFOs and the “supernatural”.Two more investigators deserve a mention in this context: T.C. Lethbridge andF.W. Holiday. Lethbridge was a retired Cambridge don who became fascinated bydowsing, and the power of the pendulum to detect various substances under theearth. (I have spoken of him at length in my book Mysteries.) Towards the end ofhis life (he died in 1971), Lethbridge became interested in flying saucers, andin a book called Legend of the Sons of God (1972) suggested that UFOs may beassociated with ancient standing stones – in fact, that such stones may havebeen set up in the remote past as “beacons” for ancient space craft. Lethbridgeknew nothing of ley lines, but his own investigations led him to conclusionsthat are remarkably similar to Michell’s.F.W. Holiday was a naturalist and a fishing journalist who became fascinated bythe mystery of the Loch Ness monster (qv) and wrote a book suggesting that itwas a giant slug, or “worm” (using this word in its medieval sense of “dragon”).But after years of study of the phenomenon he found the Loch Ness monster andother lake monsters as elusive as ufologists have found flying saucers. Hebecame increasingly convinced that both flying saucers and lake monsters belongto what he called “the phantom menagerie” (see chapter 19 on The Grey Man of BenMacDhui). This view was expressed in his book The Dragon and the Disc, and inhis posthumous work The Goblin Universe. Like Vallee, Holiday finally becameconvinced that the answer to the UFO enigma lies in “the psychic solution”. Itmust be acknowledged that there is a great deal of evidence that points in thisdirection. On the other hand, it would be premature to discount the possibilitythat they may be spacecraft from another planet or galaxy; this is a matter onwhich it would be foolish not to keep an open mind."},{"pageContent":"58 Vampires: Do They Exist?The problem of the vampire can be stated simply. Any rational person will agreethat the notion that vampires actually exist has to be pure superstition.Blood-drinking supernatural beings do not and cannot exist. There has to be somesimpler, more sensible, explanation. The objection to this view is that a numberof early accounts of vampires have such an air of sobriety and authority that itis difficult to dismiss them as pure fantasy. Here, for example, is aneighteenth-century report known as Visum et Repertum (“Seen and Discovered”),signed by no fewer than five Austrian officers, three of them doctors:> After it had been reported in the village of Medvegia [near Belgrade] that> so-called vampires had killed some people by sucking their blood, I was, by> high decree of a local Honorable Supreme Command, sent there to investigate> the matter thoroughly, along with officers detailed for that purpose and two> subordinate medical officers, and therefore carried out and heard the present> enquiry in the company of the Captain of the Stallath company of haiduks> [Balkan mercenaries and outlaws opposed to Turkish rule], Hadnack Gorschiz,> the standard-bearer and the oldest haiduk of the village. [They reported],> unanimously, as follows. About five years ago, a local haiduk called Arnod> Paole broke his neck in a fall from a hay wagon. This man had, during his> lifetime, often described how, near Gossova in Turkish Serbia, he had been> troubled by a vampire, wherefore he had eaten from the earth of the vampire’s> grave and had smeared himself with the vampire’s blood, in order to be free of> the vexation he had suffered. In twenty or thirty days after his death, some> people complained that they were being bothered by this same Arnod Paole; and> in fact, four people were killed by him. In order to end this evil, they dug> up Arnod Paole forty days after his death – this on the advice of their> Hadnack, who had been present at such events before; and they found that he> was quite complete and undecayed, and that fresh blood had flowed from his> eyes, nose, mouth, and ears; that the shirt, the covering, and the coffin were> completely bloody; that the old nails on his hands and feet, along with the> skin, had fallen off, and that new ones had grown. And since they saw from> this that he was a true vampire, they drove a stake through his heart –> according to their custom – whereupon he gave an audible groan and bled> copiously. Thereupon they burned the body to ashes the same day and threw> these into the grave. These same people also say that all those who have been> tormented and killed by vampires must themselves become vampires. Therefore> they disinterred the above mentioned four people in the same way. Then they> also add that this same Arnod Paole attacked not only people but cattle, and> sucked out their blood. And since some people ate the flesh of such cattle, it> would appear that [this is the reason that] some vampires are again present> here, inasmuch as in a period of three months, seventeen young and old people> died, among them some who, with no previous illness, died in two or at most> three days. In addition, the haiduk Jovitsa reports that his stepdaughter, by> name Stanacka, lay down to sleep fifteen days ago, fresh and healthy, but that> at midnight she started up out of her sleep with a terrible cry, fearful and> trembling, and complained that she had been throttled by the son of a haiduk> by the name of Milloe [who had died nine weeks earlier], whereupon she had> experienced a great pain in the chest, and become worse hour by hour, until> finally she died on the third day. At this, we went the same afternoon to the> graveyard, along with the aforementioned oldest haiduks of the village, in> order to cause the suspicious graves to be opened, and to examine the bodies> in them. Whereby, after all of them had been [exhumed and] dissected, the> following was found:> 1. A woman by the name of Stana, twenty years old, who had died in childbirth> two months ago, after a three-day illness, and who had herself said before her> death that she had painted herself with the blood of a vampire – wherefore> both she and the child, which had died soon after birth and through careless> burial had been half eaten by dogs – must also become vampires. She was quite> complete and undecayed. After the opening of the body there was found in the> cavitate pectoris a quantity of fresh extravascular blood. The vessels of the> arteriae, like the ventriculis cordis, were not, as is usual, filled with> coagulated blood; and the whole viscera – that is, the lung, liver, stomach,> spleen, and intestines – were quite fresh, as they would be in a healthy> person. The uterus was, however, quite enlarged and very inflamed externally,> for the placenta and lochia had remained in place, wherefore the same was in> complete putrefaction. The skin on her hands and feet, along with the old> nails, fell away on their own, but on the other hand completely new nails were> evident, along with a fresh and vivid skin.> > 2. There was a woman by the name of Militsa, sixty years old, who had died> after a three-month sickness and had been buried ninety or so days earlier.

Yet this is no secondhand tale of absurd horrors; the threedoctors were officers in the army of Charles VI, Emperor of Austria – that newlyemerging power that was succeeding the Holy Roman Empire. They were thoroughlyfamiliar with corpses, having been serving in the army that had fought the Turkssince 1714 and that defeated them four years later.A brief sketch of the historical background may clarify the emergence ofvampires in the first half of the eighteenth century. For more than fourcenturies the Turks had dominated eastern Europe, marching in and out ofTransylvania, Walachia, and Hungary and even conquering Constantinople in 1453.Don John of Austria defeated them at the great sea battle of Lepanto (1571), butit was their failure to capture Vienna after a siege in 1683 that caused thebreakup of the Ottoman Empire. During the earlier stages of this war betweenEurope and Turkey, the man whose name has become synonymous with vampirism –Dracula, or Vlad the Impaler – struck blow after blow against the Turks, untilthey killed and beheaded him in 1477.Vlad Tepes (the Impaler), king of Walachia (1456–62, 1476–77), was, as hisnickname implies, a man of sadistic temperament whose greatest pleasure was toimpale his enemies (which meant anyone against whom he had a grudge) on pointedstakes; the stake – driven into the ground – was inserted into the anus (or, inthe case of women, the vagina), and the victim was allowed to impale himselfslowly under his own weight. (Vlad often had the point blunted to make the agonylast longer.) In his own time he was known as Dracula, which means “son of adragon” or “son of the Devil”. It is estimated that Dracula had about onehundred thousand people impaled during the course of his lifetime. When heconquered Brasov, in Transylvania, he had all its inhabitants impaled on poles,then gave a feast among the corpses. When one nobleman held his nose at thestench, Vlad sent for a particularly long pole and had him impaled. When he wasa prisoner in Hungary, Vlad was kept supplied with birds, rats, and toads, whichhe impaled on small stakes. A brave and fearless warrior, he was finally killedin battle – or possibly assassinated by his own soldiers – and his head sent toConstantinople. Four hundred and twenty years later, in 1897, he wasimmortalized by Bram Stoker as the sinister Count Dracula, no longer a sadisticmaniac but a drinker of blood.By the time of the outbreak of vampirism in Medvegia in the early 1730s, Vlad’shereditary enemies, the Turks, had been driven out of Serbia, and the Austrianswere now in Belgrade – which had originally fallen to the troops of Suleiman theMagnificent in 1521. The Austrians soon became aware of a strange superstitionamong the peasantry; they dug up corpses and beheaded them, alleging that theywere vampires, or upirs.Tales of the “living dead” had been current since the days of ancient Greece.The Greeks called the creature a lamia or empusa and seemed to identify it witha witch. Lamias were not blood drinkers but cannibals. The biographerPhilostratus tells a story of the philosopher (and magician) Apollonius ofTyana, who instantly recognized the fiancée of his disciple Menippus as a lamia,and with a few magical words caused the whole wedding feast to disappear intothin air. The girl then admitted that it was her intention to make a meal ofMenippus. (Keats sentimentalizes the story in his poem Lamia; unable to believeany evil of a pretty girl, he makes her a lovelorn snake and Apollonius thecold, rational philosopher who destroys their happiness.)Tales of the “undead” – known as vrykolakas – persisted in Greece down throughthe centuries, and on January 1, 1701, a French botanist named Pitton deTornefort visited the island of Mykonos and was present at a gruesome scene ofdissection. An unnamed peasant, of sullen and quarrelsome disposition, wasmurdered in the fields by persons unknown. Two days after his burial, his ghostwas reported to be wandering around at night, overturning furniture and “playinga thousand roguish tricks”. Ten days after his burial, a mass was said to “driveout the demon” that was believed to be in the corpse, after which the body wasdisinterred and the local butcher given the task of tearing out the heart. Hisknowledge of anatomy seemed to be defective, and he tore open the stomach andrummaged around in the intestines, causing such a vile stench that incense hadto be burned. In the smoke-filled church, people began shouting “vrykolakas” andalleging that some of the smoke poured out of the corpse itself. Even after theheart had been burned at the seashore, the ghost continued to cause havoc untilthe villagers finally burned the corpse on a pyre.De Tornefort took a highly superior attitude about all this, convinced that itwas simply mass hysteria: “I have never viewed anything so pitiable as the stateof this island. Everyone’s head was turned; the wisest people were stricken likethe others”. Although the year was only 1701, de Tornefort’s attitude was thatof a typical French rationalist of the eighteenth century.Twenty years later, after the Turks were driven out of eastern Europe, westernEurope was astonished by these gruesome tales of disinterments – of which theone quoted above is so typical. And now it was no longer possible to take anattitude of amused superiority, since many of the accounts were firsthand. Anaccount of what happened when a man named Peter Plogojowitz was exhumed datesfrom 1725, seven years before the story of the vampires of Medvegia. It isrecounted by another official:> After a subject by the name of Peter Plogojowitz had died, ten weeks past – he> lived in the village of Kisilova, in the Rahm district [of Serbia] – and had> been buried according to the Raetzian custom, it was revealed that in this> same village of Kisilova, within a week, nine people, both young and old, died> also, after suffering a twenty-four-hour illness. And they said publicly,> while they were yet alive, but on their deathbed, that the above-mentioned> Peter Plogojowitz, who had died ten weeks earlier, had come to them in their> sleep, laid himself on them, and throttled them, so that they would have to> give up the ghost. The other subjects were very distressed and strengthened> even more in such beliefs by the fact that the dead Peter Plogojowitz’s wife,> after saying that her husband had come to her and demanded his opanki, or> shoes, had left the village of Kisilova and gone to another. And since with> such people (which they call vampires) various signs are to be seen – that is,> the body undecomposed, the skin, hair, beard, and nails growing – the subjects> resolved unanimously to open the grave of Peter Plogojowitz and see whether> any such above-mentioned signs were to be found on him. To this end they came> here to me, and, telling of these events, asked me and the local pope, or> parish priest, to be present at the viewing. And although I at first> disapproved, telling them that first the praiseworthy administration should be> dutifully and humbly informed, and its exalted opinion about this should be> heard, they did not want to accommodate themselves to this at all but rather> gave this short answer: I could do what I wanted, but if I did not accord them> the viewing and the legal recognition to deal with the body according to their> custom, they would have to leave house and home, because by the time a> gracious resolution was received from Belgrade, perhaps the entire village –> and this was supposed to have happened once before when it was under the Turks> – could be destroyed by such an evil spirit, and they did not want to wait for> this.> > Since I could not hold such people from the resolution they had made, either> with good words or threats, I went to the village of Kisilova, taking along> the Gradisk pope, and viewed the body of Peter Plogojowitz, just exhumed,> finding it, in accordance with thorough truthfulness, that first of all I did> not detect the slightest odor that is otherwise characteristic of the dead,> and the body – except for the nose, which was somehow sunken – was completely> fresh. The hair and the beard – even the nails, of which the old ones had> fallen away – had grown on him; the old skin, which was somewhat whitish, had> peeled away, and a new fresh one had emerged under it. The face, hands, and> feet, and the whole body, were so constituted, that they could not have been> more complete in his lifetime. Not without astonishment, I saw some fresh> blood in his mouth, which according to the common observation, he had sucked> from the people killed by him. In short, all the indications were present (as> remarked above) as such people are supposed to have. After both the pope and I> had seen this spectacle, while the people grew more outraged than distressed,> all the subjects, with great speed, sharpened a stake – in order to pierce the> corpse of the deceased with it – and put this at his heart, whereupon, as he> was pierced, not only did much blood, completely fresh, flow also through his> ears and mouth, but still other wild signs (which I pass by out of high> respect) took place. [He means that the corpse had an erection.] Finally,> according to their usual practice, they burned the aforementioned body, in hoc> casu, to ashes, of which I (now) inform the most laudable administration, and> at the same time would like to request, obediently and humbly, that if a> mistake was made in this matter, such as is to be attributed not to me but to> the rabble, who were beside themselves with fear.> > Imperial Provisor, Gradisk District> > Here again we have a respectable official vouching for the fact that the corpselooked remarkably fresh and had fresh blood in the mouth.Let us consider these accounts in more detail. To begin with, it seems clearthat the vampire is not a physical body that clambers out of its grave – as inDracula – but some sort of ghost or spectral “projection”. In the long accountof the Medvegia vampires signed by Dr. Fluchinger et al., we find that thevampire lies down beside its victim and throttles her; a mark on the girl’sthroat seems to indicate that this is what happened. There is nothing here ofthe Draculalike vampire who sinks his pointed fangs into the victim’s flesh.What the villagers allege is that the body has been taken over by a demonicentity, which attacks the living and somehow drains their vitality. The corpsethat is the home of the demonic entity then flourishes in the grave and evencontinues to grow new skin and nails. The detail of blood in the chest seems alittle puzzling, until, we look again at the account and see that the blood isfound in the breast cavity (cavitate pectoris) of the woman named Stana, whilethe lungs are mentioned separately later in the same sentence; in other words,when the breast was opened up, exposing the heart, fresh blood was found. Thereis no reason, in this particular instance, to suppose that this is the blood ofthe victim; it is presumably the vampire’s own.The many skeptics who have written on the subject of vampires usually producethe same rationalizations. These are typified by the long article on vampirismin Rossell Hope Robbins’s Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology (1959). Hepoints out that there must have been many premature burials and that when thegrave of such an unfortunate was opened, the corpse would be found in acontorted position that suggested that it had come to life. He also points outthat “the existence of maniacs who crave for blood” could have given rise to thelegend of the vampire. The sudden deaths of a large number of people in a spaceof weeks is explained by plague or other unknown forms of illness. Paul Barber,in Vampires, Burial and Death (from which the above translations have beenquoted), takes much the same line, although he admits that the premature burialtheory fails to explain the Medvegia “outbreak”. But he goes on to point outthat different bodies decay at different rates and that therefore, there isnothing surprising in the description of a two-month-old body that remains asfresh as when it was buried.All this is plausible enough. But if we read straight through the accounts byFluchinger and the Gradisk provisor (a steward to a religious house), we seethat these rationalizations simply fail to provide an adequate explanation ofwhat has taken place. It is true that the account of Arnod Paole, the soldierwho became a vampire, is secondhand, having occurred five years before theofficers went to investigate the new outbreak of vampirism. We may thereforedoubt whether he gave an “audible groan” as they drove a stake through hisheart, and all the other details of the hearsay account. But even if we supposethat some plague was really responsible for the deaths of the seventeenvillagers, it is hard to explain why eleven of the corpses were undecayed, whileonly four corpses were decomposed in the manner one might expect.In fact, the real problem with all these debunkers of the vampire theory is thatthey do their debunking piecemeal; that is, they concentrate on some small pointthat they feel they can disprove and then behave as if they have produced atotal explanation that makes any further discussion unnecessary. Those peoplewho – like myself – find their theories inadequate might well agree thatvampires cannot really exist. But they simply cannot agree that the skepticshave proved their point and produced a convincing explanation for the manyhighly detailed stories.Paul Barber also cites an interesting case known as the Shoemaker of Breslau. Hetakes his version from an 1868 collection of Prussian folklore by J. Grasse, butthere is an earlier version of the same story in Henry More’s Antidote AgainstAtheism (1653). This describes how, on September 21, 1591, a well-to-doshoemaker of Breslau, in Silesia – one account gives his name as Weinrichius –cut his throat with a knife and soon after died from the wound. Since suicidewas regarded as a mortal sin, his wife tried to conceal it and announced thather husband had died of a stroke. An old woman was taken into the secret, andshe washed the body and bound up the throat so skillfully that the wound wasinvisible. A priest who came to comfort the widow was taken to view the corpseand noticed nothing suspicious. The shoemaker was buried on the following day,September 22, 1591.Perhaps because of this unseemly haste, and the refusal of the wife to allowneighbours to view the body, a rumor sprang up that the shoemaker had committedsuicide. After this, his ghost began to be seen in the town. Soon it wasclimbing into bed with people and squeezing them so hard that it left the marksof its fingers on their flesh. This finally became such a nuisance that in theyear following the burial, on April 18, 1592, the council ordered the grave tobe opened. The body was complete and undamaged by decay but “blown up like adrum.” The skin had peeled away from the feet, and another had grown, “muchpurer and stronger than the first.” He had a “mole like a rose” on his big toe –which was interpreted as a witch’s mark – and there was no smell of decay,except in the shroud itself. Even the wound in the throat was undecayed. Thecorpse was laid under a gallows, but the ghost continued to appear. By May 7 ithad grown “much fuller of flesh.” Finally, the council ordered that the corpseshould be beheaded and dismembered. When the body was opened up, the heart wasfound to be “as good as that of a freshly slaughtered calf.” Finally, the bodywas burned on a huge bonfire of wood and pitch and the ashes thrown into theriver. After this, the ghost ceased to appear.Barber agrees that “much in this story is implausible” but points out that somany details – notably the description of the body – are so precise as to leaveno doubt “that we are dealing with real events.”But what are these “real events”? Before we comment further, let us consideranother well-known case from the same year, 1592 (which is, of course, more thana century earlier than the famous vampire outbreak we have been discussing).This case has also been discussed by both More and Grasse and concerns analderman of Pentsch (or Pentach) in Silesia named Johannes Cuntze (whose nameMore Latinizes to Cuntius). On his way to dinner with the mayor, Cuntze tried toexamine a loose shoe of a mettlesome horse and received a kick, presumably onthe head. The blow apparently unsettled his reason; he complained that he was agreat sinner and that his body was burning. He also refused to see a priest.This gave rise to all kinds of rumors about him, including that he had made apact with the Devil.As Cuntze was dying, with his son beside the bed, the casement opened and ablack cat jumped into the room and leapt onto Cuntze’s face, scratching himbadly; he died soon after. At his funeral on February 8, 1592, “a great tempestarose”; it continued to rage as he was buried beside the altar of the localchurch.Before he was buried, there were stories that his ghost had appeared andattempted to rape a woman. After the burial the ghost began to behave like amischievous hobgoblin, throwing things about, opening doors, and causing bangingnoises so that “the whole house shaked again.” On the morning after these eventsanimal footprints or hoof marks were found outside in the snow. His widow hadthe maid sleeping in her bed; the ghost of Cuntze appeared and demanded to beallowed to take his proper place beside his wife. And the parson of the parish(who is mentioned as the chronicler of these events) dreamed that Cuntze was“squeezing” him and woke up feeling utterly exhausted. The spirit was also ableto cause a nauseating stench to fill the room.The conclusion is much as in the story of the shoemaker of Breslau. Cuntze wasfinally disinterred on July 20, six months after his burial, and was found to beundecayed, and when a vein in the leg was opened, the blood that ran out was “asfresh as the living.” After having been transported to the bonfire with somedifficulty – his body had apparently become as heavy as a stone – he wasdismembered (the blood was, again, found to be quite fresh) and burned to ashes.In fact, there are even earlier accounts of the walking dead. The French experton vampires, Jean Marigny, remarks:> Well before the eighteenth century, the epoch when the word “vampire” first> appeared, people believed in Europe that the dead were able to rise from their> graves to suck the blood of the living. The oldest chronicles in Latin mention> manifestations of this type, and their authors, instead of employing the word> “vampire” (which did not yet exist) utilized a term just as explicit, the word> sanguisugae (Latin for “leech,” or “bloodsucker”). The oldest of these> chronicles date from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and, contrary to> what one might expect, are not set in remote parts of Europe, but in England> and Scotland.26> [CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2238953]> > Marigny goes on to cite four cases described by the twelfth-century chronicler,William of Newburgh, author of Historia rerum Anglicarum. These are too long tocite here (although they can be found in full in Montague Summers’s The Vampirein Europe). The first, “of the extraordinary happenings when a dead man wanderedabroad out of his grave,” describes a case in Buckinghamshire, recounted to thechronicler by the local archdeacon. It describes how a man returned from thegrave the night after his burial and attacked his wife. When this happened againthe following night, the wife asked various neighbours to spend the night withher, and their shouts drove the ghost away. Then, like Cuntze and Weinrichius,the ghost began to create a general disturbance in town, attacking animals andalarming people. That he was a ghost, and not a physical body, is proved by thecomment that some people could see him while others could not (although they“perceptibly felt his horrible presence”). The archdeacon consulted the bishop,Hugh of Lincoln, whose learned advisers suggested that the body should be dug upand burned to ashes. Hugh of Lincoln felt this would be “undesirable” andinstead wrote out a charter of absolution. When the tomb was opened, the bodyproved to be “uncorrupt,” just as on the day it was buried. The absolution wasplaced on his chest and the grave closed again; after that, the ghost ceased towander abroad.William of Newburgh’s other account sounds slightly more like the traditionalvampire in that the ghost – of a wealthy man who had died at Berwick on Tweed –had an odor of decomposition that affected the air and caused plague. The bodywas exhumed (it is not recorded whether it was undecayed) and burned.The third story concerns a priest, chaplain of a lady of rank, at Melrose Abbey,whose life had been far from blameless; after death, his ghost haunted thecloister and appeared in the bed-chamber of the lady of rank. The body wasexhumed and burned.In the fourth story, a dissolute lord of Alnwick Castle, in Northumberland,spied on his wife’s adultery by lying on top of the “roof” that covered herfour-poster bed. The sight of his wife and her lover “clipping at clicket” soincensed him that he fell down and injured himself, dying a few days laterwithout absolution. He also returned as a ghost to haunt the district, hisstench causing a plague that killed many people. When the corpse was exhumed, itproved to be “gorged and swollen with a frightful corpulence”; when attackedwith a spade, there gushed out such a stream of blood “that they realized thatthis leech had battened on the blood of many poor folk.” The body was crematedand the haunting ceased.These stories have the touches of absurdity that might be expected from anecclesiastical chronicler of that period; yet their similarity to the otherchronicles cited suggests that they have some common basis. The same applies toanother work, De nugis curialum by Walter Map (1193), also cited at length bySummers.All these cases took place long before western Europe heard tales of vampiresfrom former Turkish dominions, and, except in the case of the “leech” ofAlnwick, there is no suggestion of blood drinking. But in most ways, therevenants behave very much like Peter Plogojowitz and the vampires of Medvegia.They haunt the living, climb into bed with people when they are asleep, and thenthrottle them, leaving them drained of energy. And when the bodies aredisinterred, they are found to be undecayed. It seems very clear that there isno basic difference between the vampires of 1732 and the revenants of 1592. Andwhen we look more closely into the accounts of the vampires, we discover thatthey are energy suckers rather than blood suckers. Peter Plogojowitz has freshblood in his mouth, but it is merely a matter of hearsay that he sucked theblood of his victims – the account mentions only throttling. Otherwise, theseearlier revenants behave very much like the paranormal phenomena known aspoltergeists – they throw things and create disturbances.One of the earliest accounts of poltergeist activity can be found in a documentknown as Sigebert’s Chronicle, by one Sigebert of Gembloux (Belgium), whichdates from the ninth century. One passage runs as follows:> There appeared this year [858] in the diocese of Mentz [near Bingen, on the> Rhine] a spirit which revealed himself at first by throwing stones, and> beating against the walls of houses as if with a great mallet. He then> proceeded to speak and reveal secrets, and discovered the authors of several> thefts and other matters likely to breed disturbances in the neighbourhood. At> last he vented his malice upon one particular person, whom he was industrious> in persecuting and making odious to all the neighbours by representing him as> the cause of God’s anger against the whole village. The spirit never forsook> the poor man but tormented him without intermission, burnt all the corn in the> barns, and set every place on fire where he came. The priests attempted to> frighten him away be exorcisms, prayers, and holy water, but the spectre> answered them with a volley of stones which wounded several of them. When the> priests were gone he was heard to bemoan himself and say that he was forced to> take refuge in the cowl of one of the priests, who had injured the daughter of> a man of consequence in the village. He continued in this manner to infest the> village for three years together, and never gave up until he had set every> house on fire.> > The account in another document, the Annales Fuldenses, from which Sigebert ofGembloux condensed this account, mentions that the man the spirit tormented wasa farmer and that the spirit accused him of adultery and of seducing thedaughter of his overseer.Now at this point, oddly enough, we leave the realm of superstition – if thevampire is indeed superstition – and enter that of actuality. For thepoltergeist is undoubtedly one of the best-authenticated of all psychicalphenomena; there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of accounts on record.Poltergeists specialize in mischief and seem to be the juvenile delinquents ofthe psychic world. They drive people to distraction with their pranks, causingobjects to fly through the air (and sometimes change course abruptly inmidflight) and often making a racket that can be heard for miles. Allowing forthe exaggerations of the medieval chronicler, the above case from Sigebert hasthe ring of authenticity. It is true that speaking poltergeists are unusual;nevertheless, there are a number of cases on record (see chapter 41).Generally speaking, poltergeists do no harm; Giraldus Cambrensis remarks of aPembrokeshire poltergeist of A.D. 1191 that it seemed to intend “to deriderather than to do bodily injury.” Again, however, there are a few exceptions.The psychical investigator Guy Lyon Playfair mentions a Brazilian case in whichthe poltergeist drove a girl to suicide by tormenting her. And the poltergeistknown as the “Bell witch,” whose malign activities continued from 1817 to 1821in Robertson County, Tennessee, fixed its attentions on one particular man,farmer John Bell, and – like Sigebert’s poltergeist – “tormented him withoutintermission,” beating him black and blue and finally poisoning him.What exactly is a poltergeist? Writers like Sigebert and Giraldus Cambrensistook the understandable view that it was a spirit. Modern psychical research isinclined to find such a view embarrassing. Frank Podmore, one of the founders ofthe Society for Psychical Research, concluded in 1890 that they are mischievouschildren throwing stones. But conscientious investigators soon realized thatsuch a view was untenable. In the mid-twentieth century they finally came toterms with the poltergeist by deciding that it was an example of “recurrentspontaneous psychokinesis” (RSPK) or “mind over matter”. A few gifted psychicsare able to move small objects, such as pins, compass needles, or scraps ofpaper, by concentrating on them. No one has yet succeeded in doing anything morespectacular with “mind force” – even some thing as modest as throwing a stone.On the other hand, it was soon noticed by investigators that nearly allpoltergeist occurrences seemed to centre around an emotionally disturbedadolescent or one on the point of puberty. If these individuals were somehowcausing the poltergeist effects, then they must be doing so unconsciously. Oneof the strongest advocates of this theory was the Freudian psychiatrist NandorFodor, who was also a distinguished psychical investigator. Fodor argued thatthe Freudian unconscious is to blame for the “spontaneous psychokinesis” andthat the energies involved are the powerful sexual energies of puberty. NeitherFodor nor any other adherent of the theory could explain how the unconsciousmind could cause heavy objects to fly through the air and even cause them topenetrate solid walls. But the theory had a satisfyingly scientific ring and wassoon generally accepted.In the early 1970s, however, one investigator came to have strong doubts aboutthis theory. He was Guy Lyon Playfair, a Cambridge graduate who had gone toteach English in Rio de Janeiro. He became interested in the paranormal after apersonal experience of “psychic surgery” and joined the Brazilian Institute forPsycho Biophysical Research (IBPP). In Brazil, a large proportion of thepopulation are adherents of a religion known as Spiritism, based on the writingsof the Frenchman Allan Kardec, which accepts communication with the dead and theactive role of spirits in human existence. After engaging in a number ofpoltergeist investigations, Playfair was less inclined to dismiss Spiritism asnonsense – in fact, he concluded that Kardec is correct in asserting thatpoltergeists are spirits. His investigations into the Brazilian form of voodoo,known as umbanda, also convinced him that it actually works and that umbandapractitioners often perform their “magic” by means of spirits. The experiencesthat led him to these conclusions are described in his book The Flying Cow.In a book entitled Poltergeist, I have described how my own investigations ledme to conclude that Playfair was correct (see also chapter 41) and how the“spontaneous psychokinesis” theory simply fails to cover all the facts. Afterbeing a convinced adherent of this theory, I found myself forced by the evidenceto accept the embarrassing view that poltergeists are spirits. Since that time Ihave met many psychical researchers – particularly in America – who are at leastwilling to entertain that possibility.The same (as we shall see elsewhere in this volume) applies to the closelyrelated field of “possession”, the notion that human beings may be possessed by“unclean spirits”. The standard view is stated in Aldous Huxley’s well-knownstudy, The Devils of Loudun, in which it is taken for granted that the nuns whowrithed on the ground and uttered appalling blasphemies were in the grip ofsexual hysteria. Here, even more than in the case of the poltergeist, it seemsnatural to assume that we are dealing with psychological illness – and no doubtin many cases this is so. Yet a number of American psychiatrists – among themMorton Prince, Ralph Allison, and Adam Crabtree – have produced studies of“multiple personality” in which they admit that it is difficult to explaincertain cases except in terms of possession by the spirit of a deceased person.(See chapter 42.)Another piece of interesting evidence for this view of possession can be foundin Professor lan Stevenson’s study, Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation. Hedescribes the case of a Hindu boy named Jasbir Lal Jat, who apparently died atthe age of three in 1954. Before he could be buried, he revived – but with a newpersonality completely unlike the old one. This new Jasbir claimed to be a mannamed Sobha Ram, who had died in the village of Vehedi after a fall from a cart.He claimed to be of Brahmim caste and made difficulties about his food. Thefamily dismissed his claims as childish imagination. But when Jasbir was six, aBrahmin woman from Vehedi came to the village, and Jasbir insisted that she washis aunt. She was, in fact, the aunt of a man named Sobha Ram who had died of afall from a cart at precisely the same time Jasbir had revived. Taken to Vehedi,Jasbir showed an intimate knowledge of the place and of Sobha Ram’s relatives,convincing his own father and mother that he was telling the truth. Theconclusion must be that if Jasbir was Sobha Ram, then the “spirit” of the lattertook possession of the vacant body at the moment Jasbir “died”.In his classic work, Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death,Frederic Myers, one of the founding members of the Society for PsychicalResearch, devotes a chapter to “Trance, Possession and Ecstacy”. He begins byacknowledging that when spiritualist “mediums” go into a trance, they are “takenover” by spirits and that this constitutes the phenomenon that was once called“possession”. He adds that in some cases, the spirit messages may be deceptiveand that “they suggest – nor can we absolutely disprove the suggestion – a typeof intelligence inferior to humans, animal-like, and perhaps parasitic”. This isas far as he is willing to go in conceding that possession may occasionally benonbenevolent. But he goes on to cite many cases of what he calls “psychicinvasion” – that is, cases in which someone has seen the “spirit” of anotherperson, often someone who has died at exactly that moment. In other cases, theperson who “appears” is still alive. A Mrs T., living in Adelaide, recounts how,lying in bed but still wide awake, she saw a former lover standing in thebedroom, as well as another man, whom she felt to be a cousin who had “been themeans of leading him astray”. The former lover, who looked very pale, told herthat his father had just died and that he had inherited his property. Becauseher husband was skeptical about this vision, she wrote it down. Some weeks latershe heard that her lover’s father had died at exactly the time of the vision andhad left him his property.Another case, cited in Phantasms of the Living (which Myers co-authored), has aslightly more sinister touch. A nineteen-year-old girl described how she hadbegun having dreams of a man with a mole on the side of his mouth, and how thesefilled her with repugnance. The dreams always began with a feeling of some kindof “influence” coming over her. (In spite of her reticence, it is clear thatthese dreams were of a sexual nature and that the man was forcing her toparticipate in sex acts.) Two years later, at a party in Liverpool, she felt thesame “influence” and turned around to find herself looking into the face of theman with the mole. She was introduced to him, and he insisted that they had metbefore, which she denied. But when he reminded her of a Birmingham musicfestival, she suddenly remembered that she had experienced the same unpleasantsense of “influence” there and had then fainted. After this the man began topursue her and even began talking about the dreams. She felt instinctively thatif she admitted to these, she would be in his power; therefore, she pretendednot to understand. Eventually, she left Liverpool and ceased to see him.Here it seems clear that the man had recognized her as the kind of person overwhom he was able to exercise some psychic “influence” and had somehow invadedher dreams. If we can once concede the possibility of such “invasion”, as wellas the possibility of “spirits”, then the notion of vampires suddenly seems lessabsurd.In a remarkable book entitled Hungry Ghosts, the British journalist Joe Fisherhas described his own strange experience of “spirits”. Fisher had written a bookabout reincarnation, in the course of which he had become convinced of itsreality. One day, after being interviewed on the radio in Toronto (where helives), he received a phone call from a woman who explained that she hadaccidentally become a mouthpiece of “discarnate entities”. She was beinghypnotized in an attempt to cure her of leukemia, and various “spirit guides”had begun speaking through her mouth. (Myers points out that a “spirit” can onlyenter a body when the usual “tenant” is absent, a point to note when consideringthat early accounts of vampires involve attack during sleep.)The first time Fisher went to the woman’s house, a “spirit” named Russell spokethrough her mouth with a reassuring Yorkshire accent and told him that he had afemale “guide”, a Greek girl named Filipa, who had been his mistress in aprevious existence three centuries earlier. This struck Fisher as plausible,since he had always felt some affinity with Greece. He began attending theseances regularly and devoting some time every morning to relaxing and trying tocontact Filipa. Eventually he succeeded; buzzing noises in his ears would besucceeded by a feeling of bliss and communication. Filipa was a sensual littlecreature who liked to be hugged, and Fisher implies that, in some sense, theybecame lovers. It broke up his current love affair; his live-in girlfriend feltshe was no match for a ghost.Other people at the séances were told about their “guides” or guardian angels.One guide was an ex-RAF pilot named Ernest Scott, another an amusing cockneynamed Harry Maddox. Fisher’s disillusionment began when, on a trip back toEngland, he decided to try and verify Ernest Scott’s war stories – having nodoubt whatever that they would prove genuine. The airfield was certainlygenuine; so was the squadron Ernest claimed to have belonged to; thedescriptions of wartime raids were accurate; so were the descriptions of thesquadron’s moves from airfield to airfield. But there had been no Ernest Scottin the squadron, and a long search in the Public Record Office failed to turn uphis name. Fisher went back to Canada in a bitter mood and accused Ernest oflying. Ernest strenuously denied it. Anyway, he said, he was due to reincarnatein another body, so had to leave. The “guide” Russell later told Fisher thatErnest had been reborn in England and gave the name of the parents and date ofbirth. Oddly enough, when Fisher checked on this it proved to be accurate. Heeven contacted the parents, who were intrigued but decided they had no wish toget more deeply involved.With Russell’s approval, Fisher tried to track down the farm in Yorkshire whereRussell claimed he had lived in the nineteenth century. Here again, many of thefacts Russell had given about the Harrogate area proved to be accurate; butagain, the crucial facts were simply wrong. It seemed that Russell was also aliar. And so, upon investigation, was the lovable World War I veteran HarryMaddox. His accounts of World War I battles were accurate; but Harry did notexist.Finally, Fisher took his search to Greece. In spite of his disillusion with theother guides, he had no doubt whatever that Filipa was genuine. She possessed,he states early in the book, “more love, compassion and perspicacity than I hadever known”. The problem was that all his attempts to locate Theros – a villagenear the Turkish border – in atlases or gazetteers had failed. Yet that could bebecause it had been destroyed by the Turks in the past three centuries. But atown called Alexandroupoli, which Filipa had mentioned, still existed. After along and frustrating search for the remains of Theros, Fisher went toAlexandroupoli, a city that he assumed had been founded by Alexander the Great.But a brochure there disillusioned him. Alexandroupoli was a mere two centuriesold; it had not even existed at the time when he and Filipa were supposed tohave been lovers. Like the others, Filipa was a liar and a deceiver.In a chapter entitled “Siren Call of the Hungry Ghosts”, Fisher tries to analyzewhat has happened to him. The answer seems simple. He had been involved withwhat Kardec called “earthbound spirits”, spirits who either do not realize theyare dead or have such a craving to remain on earth that they remain attached toit:> These earthbound spirits or, in Tibetan Buddhist phraseology, pretas or> “hungry ghosts”, are individuals whose minds, at the point of physical death,> have been incapable of disentangling from desire. Thus enslaved, the> personality becomes trapped on the lower planes even as it retains, for a> while, its memory and individuality. Hence the term “lost soul”, a residual> entity that is no more than an astral corpse-in-waiting. It has condemned> itself to perish; it has chosen a “second death”.> > Fisher also quotes Lieutenant Colonel Arthur E. Powell’s book entitled TheAstral Body:> Such spooks are conscienceless, devoid of good impulses, tending towards> disintegration, and consequently can work for evil only, whether we regard> them as prolonging their vitality by vampirising at séances, or polluting the> medium and sitters with astral connections of an altogether undesirable kind.> > And Fisher cites the modern American expert on out-of-the-body journeys, RobertMonroe:> Monroe tells of encountering a zone next to the Earth plane populated by the> “dead”, who couldn’t or wouldn’t realize they were no longer physical beings .> . . The beings he perceived “kept trying to be physical, to do and be what> they had been, to continue being physical one way or another.

And apsychical investigator named Carl Wickland, whose Thirty Years Among the Dead isa classic of Spiritualism (see chapter 42), declared that “these earthboundspirits are the supposed ‘devils’ of all ages; devils of human origin. . . . Theinfluence of these discarnate entities is the cause of many of the inexplicableand obscure events of earth life and of a large part of the world’s misery”.Wickland states that these entities are attracted to the magnetic lightemanating from mortals; they attach themselves to these auras, finding an avenueof expression through influencing, obsessing, or possessing their victims.Such spirits can easily be contacted by means of an Ouija board, a smoothtabletop with letters arranged in a semicircle; the “sitters” place theirfingers on an upturned glass, which moves of its own accord from letter toletter, spelling out words. Anyone who has ever tried it will have noticed thatthe “spirits” seldom tell the truth. G. K. Chesterton devotes several pages ofhis Autobiography to experiments with an Ouija board, and while he concedes thatthe force that moves the glass is, in some sense, “supernatural”, henevertheless concludes: “The only thing I will say with complete confidenceabout that mystic and invisible power is that it tells lies”.This is interesting, because Chesterton became a Roman Catholic convert, and theCatholic church has always been strongly opposed to “Spiritualism”. This is notbecause the Church rejects life after death, but because it is deeply suspiciousof the kind of entities that “come through” at séances, taking the view thatspirits have no reason to hang around the “earth plane”, any more than adultswant to hang around their old childhood schools. Unlike H. G. Wells, JulianHuxley, or other modern rationalists, Chesterton did not reject “spiritcommunication” as a fraud or delusion; but, like Joe Fisher, he was unable toaccept the “spirits” at face value.If we can at once concede the possibility of “psychic invasion”, as well as thepossibility of “spirits”, then the notion of vampires suddenly seems lessabsurd. In The Magus of Strovolos, an American academic, Kyriacos C. Markides,has described his friendship with a modern Cypriot mystic and “magus”, SpyrosSathi, known as Daskalos, who lives in Nicosia. Daskalos, like Myers and Fisher,takes the actual reality of spirits for granted, but he also speaks withoutembarrassment of possession and vampirism.Some of Markides’s stories of Daskalos are so extraordinary that most readerswill suspect him of extreme gullibility. Yet Daskalos’s teachings, as quoted byMarkides, make it clear that he deserves to be classified with suchtwentieth-century teachers as Steiner and Gurdjieff. And Markides offers manyexamples that seem to leave no doubt whatsoever of the genuineness of Daskalos’spsychic powers. He was able to describe Markides’s house in America inremarkable detail, although he had no way of learning such details. On anotheroccasion, when Markides and a friend were searching for Daskalos, Markidesremarked jokingly that perhaps he was visiting a mistress; when they found himand asked where he had been, Daskalos snapped, “Visiting a mistress”, then wenton to say that he had overheard all their “silly conversation”. It becomes clearthat Daskalos takes “possession” for granted, and Markides tells a number ofstories, in some of which he was personally involved.There are, Daskalos claims, three kinds of possession: by ill-disposed humanspirits; by demonic entities; and by elementals (the latter being human thoughtsand desires that have taken on a life of their own). He goes on to describe acase of spirit possession of the first type. Daskalos was approached by theparents of a girl who claimed that she was being haunted by the spirit of herdead fiancé. Although they had lived together, she had refused to allow him topossess her until they were married. He died of tuberculosis, haunted byunfulfilled cravings. “Each night before she would go to bed he wouldsemi-hypnotise her and induce her to keep the window of her room open. He wouldthen enter inside a bat and would come to her. The bat would wedge itself on herneck and draw blood and etheric [energy]”. The local priest told Daskalos how todeal with the situation. He must wait in the next room, and when he heard thebat entering, should go in and quickly shut the window; then, since the batwould attack him, he must stun it with a broom. Then he must wrap the bat in atowel and burn it in a brazier [stove]. Daskalos did this, and as the batburned, the girl screamed and groaned. Then she calmed down and asked, “Why wereyou trying to burn me?” The “haunting” ceased thereafter.Daskalos told another story that has elements of vampirism. On a journey insouthern Greece he had encountered another girl who was being haunted by aformer lover, a shepherd who had been in love with her and had died in a motoraccident. Five years later, when looking for some goats, the girl saw theshepherd – whose name was Loizo – and he followed her, finally making her feelso sleepy that she felt obliged to sit down. He then “hypnotized” her and causedher to experience intense sexual pleasure. When she reported the incident, shewas medically examined and found to be a virgin. But three days later theshepherd came to her bed and made love to her. Medical examination revealed thatshe was no longer a virgin. Daskalos noticed two reddish spots on her neck. Thegirl told him: “He kisses me there, but his kisses are strange. They are likesucking, and I like them”.The doctor who examined the girl believed that she had torn the hymen with herown fingers; Daskalos seems to accept this but believes that Loizo made her dothis.Daskalos claimed that two days later, he saw the shepherd coming into the houseand greeted him. Loizo explained that he had wanted the girl for many years andhad never had sexual relations with a woman – only with animals like donkeys andgoats. Now that he was possessing her, he had no intention of letting her go. Herefused to believe it when Daskalos told him he was dead. Daskalos warned himthat if he persisted in possessing the girl, he would remain “in a narcotisedstate like a vampire”. His arguments finally convinced the shepherd, who agreedto go away.These two cases, taken in conjunction with the others we have considered, offersome interesting clues about the nature of the vampire. According to Daskalos,the “earthbound spirit” of the dead fiancé was able to enter an ordinary bat andthen to suck her blood. This was an expression of his sexual desire, his desireto possess her. There have been many cases of so-called Vampirism in the historyof sex crimes. In the early 1870s an Italian youth named Vincent Verzenimurdered three women and attempted to strangle several more. Verzeni waspossessed by a powerful desire to throttle women (and even birds and animals).After throttling a fourteen-year-old girl named Johanna Motta, he disemboweledher and drank her blood. Verzeni admitted that it gave him keen pleasure tosniff women’s clothing, and “it satisfied me to seize women by the neck and sucktheir blood”. So it is easy to imagine that the earthbound fiancé mentioned byDaskalos should enjoy drinking the girl’s blood. But we can also see that hisdesire to “possess” her was also satisfied in another way – by somehow takingcontrol of her imagination.Again, in the case of Loizo, we can see that the shepherd had entered the girl’sbody and taken possession of her mind so that he could cause her to tear her ownhymen with her fingers. This implies – as we would expect – that the lovemakingwas not on the physical level, since Loizo possessed no body. (Joe Fisher seemsto hint at something similar when he describes his relationship with Filipa.)All of this has interesting implications. The act of lovemaking seems to involvea paradox, since it is an attempt at the mingling of two bodies, an attempt thatis doomed to failure by their separateness. In the Symposium, Plato expressesthe paradox in an amusing myth. Human beings were originally spherical beingswho possessed the characteristics of both sexes. Because their sheer vitalitymade them a challenge to the gods, Zeus decided that they had to be enfeebled.So he sliced them all down the centre, “as you and I might slice an apple”, andturned their faces back to front. And now the separated parts spent their livesin a desperate search for their other half, and they ceased to constitute achallenge to the gods.It is plain that, in its crudest form, the male sexual urge is basically adesire for “possession” and that the act of physical penetration is an act ofaggression. (Most writers on Dracula, for example, have noted that it isbasically a rape fantasy.) As a man holds a woman in his arms, he experiences adesire to absorb her, to blend with her, and the actual penetration is only atoken union. So we might say that a “vampire” like Loizo is able to achieve whatevery lover dreams about: a possession that involves total interpenetration,union of minds.The notion of vampirism that begins to emerge from all this is simple and(provided one can accept the notion of “earthbound spirits”) plausible. Daskalostold Markides that those who commit suicide may become trapped in the “ethericof the gross material world”, unable to move to the higher psychic planes. Aperson who commits suicide dies in “a state of despair and confusion” and “mayvibrate too close to the material world, which will not allow him to find rest”.He becomes a “hungry ghost”, wandering in and out of the minds of human beingslike a man wandering through a deserted city. In all probability, he is unawarethat he is dead. (The wife of Peter Plogojowitz declared that he came to herasking for his shoes; since shoes would obviously be of no use to a ghost, wemust conclude that he was unaware that his feet had “dematerialized”.) Undernormal circumstances, the spirit would be incapable of influencing hisinvoluntary host or of making his presence felt; only if the host happens tovibrate with the same desires, to be “on the same wavelength”, can true“possession” occur.It also seems clear that some human beings have a greater ability than others tosense the presence of these entities; we call such people “psychic”. They may betotally unaware that they are psychic unless some chance event happens to revealit. In a book entitled The Paranormal, the psychologist Stan Gooch has describedhow, at the age of twenty-six, he attended a séance in Coventry with a friendand spontaneously fell into a trance condition. When he awoke, he learned thatseveral “spirits” had spoken through him.It was during this period, Gooch reveals in a later book entitled Creatures fromInner Space, that he had his first experience of a “psychic invasion”. He waslying in bed one Saturday morning with his eyes closed when he felt a movementon the pillow beside his head, as if someone had gently pressed a hand againstit. The movement continued for some time; but when he opened his eyes, he wasalone.Twenty years later, lying half awake in the early morning, he became aware thatsomeone else was in bed with him. He felt that it was a composite of variousgirls he had known: “On this first occasion my conscious interest in thesituation got the better of me, and the succubus [female demon] gradually fadedaway. On subsequent occasions, however, the presence of the entity wasmaintained, until finally we actually made love”. He notes that “from somepoints of view the sex is actually more satisfying than that with a real woman,because in the paranormal encounter archetypal elements are both involved andinvoked”.Oddly enough, Gooch does not believe that his succubus was real; he thinks suchentities are creations of the human mind. He cites cases of hypnotized subjectswho have been able to see and touch hallucinations suggested by the hypnotist,and a book entitled The Story of Ruth, by Dr Morton Schatzman, which describeshow a girl whose father had tried to rape her as a child began to hallucinateher father and believe that he was in the room with her. He seems to believethat his succubus was a similar hallucination. Yet this view seems to becontradicted by other cases he cites in the book.The first of these concerns a policeman, Martin Pryer, who had always been“psychic”. At one point he decided to try practicing the control of hypnagogicimagery – the imagery we experience on the verge of sleep – and soon beganhaving alarming experiences. On one occasion, a strange entity began to cling tohis back like a limpet and held on until he staggered across the room andswitched on the light. On another occasion, he thought that a former girlfriendwas outside the window, and when he asked what she was doing, she replied, “Yousent for me”. Then a female entity seemed to seize him from behind, clinging tohis back; he sensed that it wanted him to make love to her “in a crude andviolent manner”. After some minutes it faded away.Gooch goes on to describe the experiences of an actress friend named Sandy, whowas also “psychic”. One night, she woke up and felt that the spotlight in thecorner of her ceiling had changed into an eye that was watching her. Then shefelt an entity – she felt it was male – lying on top of her and trying to makelove to her. “One part of her was quite willing for the lovemaking to proceed,but another part of her knew that she wanted it to stop.” The entity becameheavier, and another force seemed to be dragging her down through the mattress.She made an effort to imagine that she was pulling herself up through themattress, and the pressure suddenly vanished. But when she went into thebathroom, she discovered that her mouth was rimmed with dark streaks, and whenshe opened it, it proved to be full of dried blood. There was no sign of anosebleed or any other injury that could account for the blood.Guy Playfair has described a similar case in The Flying Cow. A girl namedMarcia, who had a master’s degree in psychology, was on the beach at São Paolowhen she picked up a plaster image of the sea goddess Yemanja, which hadobviously been thrown into the sea as an offering. Against the advice of heraunt, she took it home. After this, she experienced a series of disasters. Shebegan to feel exhausted and lose weight. Her pressure cooker blew up, burningher hands and face, and her oven exploded. She began to experience suicidalimpulses. Then one night, an “entity” entered her bed, and she felt a penisentering her. It happened on several subsequent occasions. In desperation, shewent to consult an umbanda specialist, who urged her to return the statue to thebeach. As soon as she did this, the run of bad luck – and the psychic rapes –ceased.Such cases make it difficult to accept Gooch’s view that these entities are akind of hypnotic hallucination. It seems obvious that he arrived at thatconclusion because his “succubus” seemed to be a blend of previous girlfriends.But according to the “earthbound spirit” hypothesis, we would assume that theentity simply put these ideas into his mind – that is, into his imagination. Hewrites: “In short, this entity, though possessing physical and evenpsychological attributes familiar to me, was none the less essentially its ownindependent self.” And he agrees that the “archetypal elements” were, to someextent, “invoked” – that is, that he himself was conjuring them up. Sandy wasable to free herself from the “psychic invasion” by imagining that she waspulling herself back up through the mattress, indicating that the entity wascontrolling her imagination, not her body.We also note that these “psychic invasions” occurred when all three subjects –Gooch, Martin Pryer, and Sandy – were either asleep or hovering between sleepand waking, and therefore in a trance condition akin to mediumship.The evidence, then, all seems to suggest that the vampire, like the poltergeist,is an “earthbound spirit,” a “hungry ghost” that draws vitality from humanbeings. Daskalos’s remark to Loizo, that “he would remain in a narcotised statelike a vampire,” indicates that such spirits become, in effect, drug addicts whoare unable to progress to a higher level while in the grip of their addiction.One of the few contemporary “vampirologists” is a graduate of the StateUniversity of New York named Stephen Kaplan. In his book Vampires Are . . .(1984) he describes how he became interested in the subject. In the course ofhis studies in anthropology, he noticed that “many of the customs and rituals ofthe primitive cultures we were studying showed striking similarities to vampiremyths and legends.” This led him to suppose that there might be some basis oftruth in vampire legends, and in 1971 he founded the Vampire Research Center onLong Island. As a result of interviews on the radio, he received many calls,most of which were hoaxes. The first real “vampires” he encountered were acouple who liked to taste blood. (In fact, blood is an emetic, so it would beimpossible to drink it in quantity.) The woman used to whip her companion untilhe bled, then lick the cuts. They had formed a small group that would indulge inthese practices. Another woman Kaplan interviewed obtained blood by tradingsexual favours.Without exception, the people Kaplan interviewed were “sexually disturbed”. (InThe Sexual Anomalies and Perversions by Dr Magnus Hirschfeld, there is a sectiondevoted to vampirism, in which it becomes clear that it is related tonecrophilia; Hirschfeld describes, for example, a gravedigger named VictorArdisson who drank animal blood and performed various perverted acts on femalecorpses whom he disinterred.) But Kaplan suggests that genuine vampirism is “thedraining of physical energy from one individual to another, often via theblood”. He speaks of “psychic vampires”, people who seem to drain our physicalenergies. He comments that the process seems to be the reverse of “psychichealing”, whereby the healer is able to transfer energy to the patient.In an article on sexual occultism in the magazine The Unexplained, the occulthistorian Francis King describes the process by which a “magician” can causesexual arousal in a selected victim:> The would-be lover sits as near as possible to his intended victim. He gauges> her breathing by the rise and fall of her breast, and, once he has established> the exact rhythm, begins to breathe in precise unison with her. The sorcerer> continues this for a period of between three and five minutes, and then> contracts the muscles of his anus from five to ten seconds. This, supposedly,> establishes an “astral link” between the two people involved, by bringing into> action the man’s muladhara chakra, the centre of psychic activity that,> according to some occultists, controls the libido. It is situated, they claim,> in a part of the “subtle body” roughly corresponding to the area between the> anus and the genitals. The magician then gradually increases his rate of> breathing until it reaches the rate characteristic of the height of sexual> activity. The “astral link” ensures that the emotions normally associated with> this rapid breathing are communicated to the woman, and she immediately> experiences sexual arousal. The magician then begins a conversation.> > He goes on to theorize that vampirism is a way of draining “psycho-sexualenergy” from the victim.What is being suggested is that a man can establish a telepathic link betweenhimself and a woman he desires and use it to influence her desires. In God Is MyAdventure, Rom Landau tells a story of the philosopher and mystic GeorgeGurdjieff, which seems to indicate that he was also able to do this. One mantold Landau of an occasion when he was lunching with an attractive femalenovelist:> Gurdjieff caught her eye, and we saw distinctly that he began to inhale and to> exhale in a peculiar way. I am too old a hand at such tricks not to have known> that Gurdjieff was employing one of the methods he must have learned in the> East.

I asked her what the matter was, “That man> is uncanny”, she whispered. “Something awful happened”, she continued. “I> ought to be ashamed . . . I looked at your “friend” a moment ago, and he> caught my eye. He looked at me in such a peculiar way that within a second or> so I suddenly felt as though I had been struck right through my sexual centre.> It was beastly!”> > It seems likely that the “man with the mole” described in Phantasms of theLiving possessed the same curious ability and that this explained why the girlhad fainted at the Birmingham music festival; it also seems clear that, havingestablished the “psychic link”, he was able to invade her dreams in the mannerof a “vampire”.Let us, then, attempt an outline of a theory of vampirism that is in accordancewith the various accounts that have been quoted. The story of Arnod Paole, likeso many others, makes it clear that he was not a willing vampire; the Visum etRepertum states that he had been “troubled by a vampire” in Turkey and had eatenearth from the grave to free himself of the affliction. This was not successful,and the earthbound spirit returned after death to vampirize people in Medvegia.If we assume that vampirism is an experience akin to sexual satisfaction, thenthe implication is that Paole’s unquiet spirit became a vampire, much as manysexually abused children grow up to become child abusers. But this view suggeststhat sex itself may be regarded as a form of benevolent vampirism; the act oflovemaking, which has to rest content with an interpenetration of bodies, is anattempt at mutual absorption. In that case, the actions of sex criminals must beseen as a form of nonbenevolent vampirism. (The sex murderer Ted Bundy toldpolice interrogators: “Sometimes I feel like a vampire”.) If we can accept thisview, then it is not difficult to accept that some “earthbound spirits” or“hungry ghosts” also attempt to maintain their link with the world by a form ofpsychic vampirism.Only one question remains: if vampirism is a draining of psychic energy, why doso many accounts mention the drinking of blood? Stephen Kaplan suggests thatgenuine vampirism is “the draining of physical energy from one individual toanother, often via the blood”. The Visum et Repertum mentions that fresh bloodwas flowing from Paole’s eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. Gooch’s friend Sandy foundthat her mouth was full of dried blood after the “psychic attack”, although shehad no injury that might account for it.But why should a “vampire” leave its own blood behind? Is it possible that theblood was Sandy’s own and that the “incubus” (male demon) had the power to drawit from her, like a leech, without breaking the skin? This notion opens up anentirely new realm of speculation about vampires – a realm which, for lack offurther evidence, we must at present leave unexplored."},{"pageContent":"59 Velikovsky’s CometWhen the bulky manuscript of Worlds in Collision landed on the desk of a NewYork editor in 1947 its tattered state left no doubt that it had been rejectedmany times. All the same, the editor was impressed. According to the author,Immanuel Velikovsky, the earth had been almost destroyed about three and a halfthousand years ago by a near-collision with a comet; in the earthquakes andvolcanic eruptions that followed, cities were wiped out and whole countries laidwaste. It was a fascinating and erudite book, and its author – who wasapparently a respectable psychiatrist – had the ability to write a clear andvigorous prose.The editor cautiously recommended it. His superiors were worried; Macmillans wasa reputable publisher with a large textbook list; they could not afford to beaccused of encouraging the lunatic fringe. So they compromised, and offeredVelikovsky a small advance and a contract that gave them the option to publish,but no guarantee that they would do so. A year later they finally decided to goahead, and Worlds in Collision made its belated appearance on 3 April 1950.Within days it had climbed to the top of the best-seller list. When it appearedin England the following September its reputation had preceded it, so that itsold out its first impression even before publication. But by that timeMacmillans’ doubts had been justified; the denunciations of the book were soviolent that they were forced into retreat, and Worlds in Collision had to bepassed on to another publisher. By then Velikovsky had become one of the mostfamous and most vilified men in America.Who was this controversial psychiatrist who also seemed to be an expert onastronomy, geology and world history? Immanuel Velikovsky was a Russian Jew,born in Vitebsk in June 1895 who had studied mathematics in Moscow. He went onto study medicine, qualifying in 1921, then studied psychiatry in Vienna withFreud’s pupil Stekel. In 1924 he moved to Palestine to practise, and becameincreasingly interested in Biblical archaeology. The turning-point in his careerwas a reading of Freud’s Moses and Monotheism (1937). In this book Freudproposes that Moses was not a Jew but an Egyptian, and that he was a follower ofthe monotheistic religion of the Pharaoh Akhnaton (see chapter 11), the king whoreplaced the host of Egyptian gods with one single sun god. Freud proposed thatMoses fled from Egypt after the death of Akhnaton (probably murdered) andimposed his religion on the Jews.The obvious historical objection to this theory is that Moses is supposed tohave lived about a century after the death of Akhnaton; but Freud contested thisview, and moved fearlessly into the arena of historical research. Dazzled by hisboldness, Velikovsky decided to do the same. His researches into Egyptian, Greekand Near Eastern history soon convinced him that much of the accepted dating ishopelessly wrong. But they led him to an even more unorthodox conclusion: thatthe pharaoh Akhnaton was none other than the legendary Oedipus of Greek myth,and that the story arose out of the fact that Akhnaton had murdered his fatherand married his mother.Velikovsky went on to construct a theory beside which even Freud’s heterodoxviews seemed conservative; that the various events that accompanied the plaguesof Egypt – the crossing of the Red Sea, the destruction of the Egyptian armiesby floods, the manna that fell from heaven – were the outcome of some greatcosmic upheaval. And at this point Velikovsky came across exactly what he waslooking for: a papyrus written by an Egyptian sage called Ipuwer, whichcontained an account of events that sounded strangely like the Bible story inExodus.In 1939 Velikovsky moved to the United States, and continued his researches inits libraries. What precisely was the “great catastrophe”? The Austrian HarmsHoerbiger had put forward the theory that the earth has had several moons (seechapter 2), and that the collapse of one of these moons on the earth caused thegreat floods and upheavals recorded in the Bible and in other ancient documents.But Velikovsky came to reject the Hoerbiger theory. There was a far moreexciting clue. Before the second millennium BC – and even later – the planetVenus was not grouped by ancient astronomers with the other planets. That mighthave been because it was so close to the sun that they mistook it for a star –in fact, it is called the morning star. But what if it was because Venus was notin its present position at that time? Velikovsky found tantalizing references inold documents to something that sounded like a near-collision of a comet withthe earth. In legends from Greece to Mexico he found suggestions that thiscatastrophe was somehow linked with Venus. Only one thing puzzled him deeply:that other legends seemed to link the catastrophe with Zeus, the father of thegods, also known as Jupiter. He finally reconciled these stories by reaching theastonishing conclusion that Venus was “born out of Jupiter – forced out by agigantic explosion. Venus began as a comet, and passed so close to Mars that itwas dragged out of its orbit; then it came close to earth, causing the Biblicalcatastrophes; then it finally settled down near the sun as the planet Venus.It sounds like pure lunacy; but Velikovsky argued it with formidable erudition.And, unlike the usual crank, he spent a great deal of time searching forscientific evidence. He needed, for example, a spectroscopic analysis of theatmospheres of Mars and Venus, and he decided to approach the eminent astronomerHarlow Shapley. Shapley had himself become a figure of controversy in 1919 whenhe announced his conclusion that our solar system is not – as had previouslybeen believed – at the centre of the Milky Way, but somewhere much closer to itsedge; perhaps it was the blow to human self-esteem that caused the opposition.At all events, Velikovsky seems to have reasoned that Shapley might besympathetic to his own heterodox ideas. Shapley was polite, but said he was toobusy to read Worlds in Collision; he asked a colleague, a sociologist namedHorace Kallen, if he would read it first. Kallen did so, and was excited; hetold Shapley that it seemed a serious and worthwhile book, and that even if itshould prove to be nonsense, it was still a bold and fascinating thesis. TheMacmillan editor agreed, and Velikovsky got his contract.Three months before its publication, in January 1950, a preview of Worlds inCollision appeared in Harper’s magazine, and aroused widespread interest.Shapley’s reaction was curious. He wrote Macmillans a letter saying that he hadheard that they had decided not to publish the book after all, and that he wasgreatly relieved; he had discussed it with various scientists, and they were allastonished that Macmillan should venture into “the Black Arts”.Macmillans replied defensively that the book was not supposed to be hardscience, but was a controversial theory that scholars ought to know about.Shapley replied tartly that Velikovsky was “complete nonsense”, and that when hehad introduced himself to Shapley in a New York hotel Shapley had looked aroundto see if he had his keeper with him. The book, he said, was “quite possiblyintellectually fraudulent”, a legpull designed to make money, and if Macmillansinsisted on publishing it, then they had better drop Shapley from their list.Macmillans ignored this attempt at blackmail, and published the book in April.No doubt they were astonished to find that they had a best-seller on theirhands. America has a vast audience of “fundamentalists” – people who believethat every word of the Bible is literally true, and are delighted to readanything that seems to offer scientific support for this view. (The sameaudience made Werner Keller’s The Bible as History a best-seller in 1956.) Nowthey rushed to buy this book that seemed to prove that the parting of the RedSea and the destruction of the walls of Jericho had really taken place. So didthousands of ordinary intelligent readers who simply enjoyed an adventure inspeculative thought.Scientists did not share this open-mindedness. One exception was Gordon Atwater,chairman of the astronomy department at New York’s Museum of Natural History; hepublished a review urging that scientists ought to be willing to consider thebook without prejudice; the review resulted in his dismissal. James Putnam, theeditor who accepted Worlds in Collision, was dismissed from Macmillan.Professors deluged Macmillan with letters threatening to boycott their textbooksunless Worlds in Collision was withdrawn. Macmillans failed to show the samecourage that had led them to ignore similar veiled threats from Shapley; theypassed on Velikovsky to the Doubleday corporation, who had no textbookdepartment to worry about, and who were probably unable to believe their luck inbeing handed such a profitable piece of intellectual merchandise. Fred Whipple,Shapley’s successor at Harvard, wrote to Doubleday27[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2239308] telling themthat if they persisted in publishing Velikovsky, he wanted them to take his ownbook Earth, Moon and Planets off their list. (Twenty years later, he denied inprint ever writing such a letter.)Velikovsky himself was rather bewildered by the sheer violence of the reactions;it had taken him thirty years to develop his theory, and he had expectedcontroversy; but this amounted to persecution. He was willing to admit that hecould be wrong about the nature of the catastrophe; but the historical recordsshowed that something had taken place. Why couldn’t they admit that, and thencriticize his theory, instead of treating him as a madman? The only thing to dowas to go on collecting more evidence.And more evidence was produced in intimidating quantities during the remainingtwenty-nine years of Velikovsky’s life; he died on 17 November 1979, at the ageof eighty-four. In 1955 came Earth in Upheaval, in many ways his best book,presenting the scientific evidence for great catastrophes. But again it outragedscientists – this time biologists – by suggesting that there are seriousinadequacies in Darwin’s theory of “gradual evolution”, and arguing that abetter explanation would be the effect of radiation due to “catastrophes” on thegenes. Then came four books in a series that Velikovsky chose to call Ages inChaos, whose main thesis is that historians of the ancient world have made abasic mistake in their dating, and that a period of about six or seven centuriesneeds to be dropped from the chronological record. In Velikovsky’s dating, QueenHatshepsut, generally assumed to have lived about 1500 BC, becomes acontemporary of Solomon more than four centuries later (in fact, Velikovskyidentifies her with the Queen of Sheba), while the pharaoh Rameses II – assumedto live around 1250 BC – becomes a contemporary of Nebuchadnezzar more than sixcenturies later. The great invasion of barbarians known as the Sea Peoples,usually dated about 1200 BC, is placed by Velikovsky in the middle of the fourthcentury BC, about the time of the death of Plato. The arguments contained inAges in Chaos (1953), Oedipus and Akhnaton (1960), Peoples of the Sea (1977) andRameses II and his Time (1978) are of interest to historians rather than toscientists, but, like the earlier works, are totally absorbing to read. Twoother projected volumes, The Dark Age in Greece and The Assyrian Conquest, havenot so far been published. But a third volume of the Worlds in Collision series,Mankind in Amnesia, appeared posthumously in 1982. It expands a short section inWorlds in Collision arguing that catastrophic events produce a kind ofcollective amnesia. It is his most Freudian book, but it reveals that he neverlost that curious ability to produce a state of intellectual excitement in thereader, even when his arguments seem most outrageous.How far does Velikovsky deserve to be taken seriously? Should he be regarded asanother Freud, or merely as another Erich von Däniken? It must be admitted thatthe basic thesis of Worlds in Collision sounds preposterous: that variousBiblical events, like the parting of the Red Sea and the fall of the walls ofJericho, can be explained in terms of an astronomical catastrophe. But it ispossible to entertain doubts about this aspect of Velikovsky’s thesis withoutdismissing the most important part of his theory: that Venus may be far youngerthan the rest of the solar system. Moreover, whether or not Velikovsky iscorrect about the origin of Venus, there can be no doubt whatever that many ofhis controversial insights have been confirmed. Astronomers object that Jupiterwas not likely to be the source of a “comet” because it is too cold andinactive. However, a standard textbook of astronomy – Skilling and Richardson(1947) states “From the fact that Jupiter is 5.2 times as far from the source ofheat as is the earth, it can be seen that it should receive only 1/5.22, or 1/27as much heat as does the earth. The temperature that a planet should have as theresult of this much heat is very low – in the neighbourhood of –140°C”. Butspace probes have since revealed that the surface temperature on Jupiter isaround – 150°C, and that its surface is extremely turbulent, with immenseexplosions. The same textbook of astronomy states that the temperature on thesurface of Venus “may be as high as boiling water”. Velikovsky argued that itshould be much higher, since Venus is so “young” in astronomical terms. Mariner2 revealed that the temperature on the surface of Venus is about 900°C. It alsorevealed the curious fact that Venus rotates backward as compared to all theother planets, an oddity that seems incomprehensible if it was formed at thesame time and evolved through the same process.Russian space probes also revealed that Venus has violent electrical storms.Velikovsky had argued that the planets have powerful magnetic fields, and thattherefore a close brush between the earth and a “comet” would produce quitedefinite effects. The discovery of the Van Allen belts around the earthsupported Velikovsky’s view. There also seem to be close links between therotation of Venus and Earth – Venus turns the same face to earth at eachinferior conjunction, which could have come about through an interlocking oftheir magnetic fields. In the 1950s Velikovsky’s assertion about electromagneticfields in space was treated with contempt – in Fads and Fallacies in the Name ofScience, Martin Gardner remarked dismissively that Velikovsky had inventedforces capable of doing whatever he wanted them to do. His electromagnetictheory also led Velikovsky to predict that Jupiter would be found to emit radiowaves, and that the sun would have an extremely powerful magnetic field. Onecritic (D. Menzel) retorted that Velikovsky’s model of the sun would require animpossible charge of 1019 volts. Since then, Jupiter has been found to emitradio waves, while the sun’s electrical potential has been calculated at about1019 volts. It could be said that many of Velikovsky’s theories are now anaccepted part of astrophysics except, of course, that no one acknowledges thatVelikovsky was the first one to formulate them.Another matter on which Velikovsky seems to have been proved correct is thequestion of the reversal of the earth’s magnetic poles. When molten volcanicrocks cool, or when clay or brick is baked, the magnetic minerals in it aremagnetized in the direction of the earth’s magnetic field. At the turn of thecentury Giuseppe Folgerhaiter examined Etruscan vases, looking for minormagnetic variations, and was astonished to find that there seemed to have been acomplete reversal of the magnetic field around the eighth century BC. Scientistsexplained his findings by declaring that the pots must have been fired upsidedown. But in 1906 Bernard Brunhes found the same complete reversal in certainvolcanic rocks. Further research revealed that there had been at least nine suchreversals in the past 3.6 million years. No one could make any plausiblesuggestion as to why this had happened. Velikovsky’s suggestion was that it wasdue to the close approach of other celestial bodies and that the earth’s brushwith Venus should have produced such a reversal. His critics replied that therehave been no reversals in the past half-million years or so. But since then twomore have been discovered – one 28,000 years ago, the other about 12500 BC, andone of Velikovsky’s bitterest opponents Harold Urey, has come to admit that the“celestial body” theory is the likeliest explanation of pole-reversal. Yet sofar the crucial piece of evidence – volcanic rock revealing a reversal about1450 BC – has not been forthcoming.Those who regard Velikovsky as an innovator comparable to Freud should also beprepared to admit that he had many of Freud’s faults – particularly a tendencyto jump to bold and unorthodox conclusions, and then to stick by them with acertain rigid dogmatism. Yet it must also be admitted that whether or not hisVenus theory proves to be ultimately correct, his “guesses” have often beenamazingly accurate. Like Kepler, who came to all the right conclusions about thesolar system for all the wrong reasons (including the belief that it is somehowmodelled on the Holy Trinity), Velikovsky seems to possess the intuitive geniusof all great innovators. Even one of his most dismissive critics, Carl Sagan,admits: “I find the concatenation of legends which Velikovsky has accumulatedstunning . . . If twenty per cent of the legendary concordances . . . are real,there is something important to be explained”."},{"pageContent":"60 VorticesThe Bridge Between the Natural and the Supernatural?In 1839 a gray-bearded professor read a paper entitled “An Essay on the Figureof the Earth” to the Royal Society in Edinburgh; it exhibited a high order ofmathematical ability, and its author had been awarded a gold medal by EdinburghUniversity. But the professor who read it was not, in fact, its author; theactual author was a boy of fifteen named William Thomson, and he was not allowedto read his own work because it might have embarrassed the learned audience tobe lectured by a fresh-faced teenager. In due course, William Thomson went on tobecome one of the most celebrated scientists of his day, the discoverer of theSecond Law of Thermodynamics (the recognition that the universe is “runningdown”), of “absolute zero”, and of the moving coil galvanometer. He was alsoinstrumental in laying the first trans-atlantic cable and in bringing Bell’stelephone to Britain. At the age of sixty-eight he was made Lord Kelvin, and theabsolute scale of temperature still bears his name.Yet if Kelvin had been asked what he considered his most important achievement,he would undoubtedly have replied: the vortex (or whirlpool) theory of atoms – atheory that has now been totally forgotten. In fact, most of his contemporarieswould have agreed; the 1875 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica carries atwo-page entry on his vortex theory of atoms, written by the eminentmathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell. The idea had come to Kelvin in 1867,in a flash of inspiration, and only a few weeks later, he delivered a paper onhis theory to the same Royal Society in Edinburgh that had listened to his firstpaper twenty-eight years earlier.Kelvin had been a child prodigy; the son of James Thomson, a Belfast professorof mathematics, he had started attending his father’s lectures at the age ofeight and had entered the University of Glasgow (to which his father had moved)at the age of eleven. A trip to Europe at the age of sixteen had introduced himto Fourier’s book on the mathematical theory of heat; from then on, he wasdetermined to become a physicist – or, as they called it in those days, a“natural philosopher”.The dazzling idea that struck him in 1867 seems to have developed from hisobservation of smoke rings. A simple way to create these is to introduce smokeinto a box that has a round hole in one of its sides. If you give the oppositeside of the box a vigorous slap (particularly if that side is made of some softmaterial like toweling), a smoke ring will shoot out of the hole. But if you tryto stop the smoke ring with your hand, it will not dissolve like a bubble, asyou might expect. It will simply bounce off your hand like a rubber ball. If youmake two smoke rings collide head on, they vibrate from the impact like twocharging bulls meeting head on, then bounce away from each other. In short, theybehave like solid objects.In 1803 an English chemist named John Dalton had suggested that matter isfinally made up of tiny hard balls called “atoms”, which are indivisible. He hadborrowed the idea from the Greek philosopher Democritus but had backed it upwith highly convincing evidence. Dalton’s theory had led to a number ofimportant breakthroughs in physics and chemistry, such as the recognition of howatoms fuse together to form molecules – so that two atoms of hydrogen, forexample, combine with one of oxygen to form water.That still left many problems. For example, why are atoms of hydrogen and oxygenquite different? You would think that if the universe were made up of primordialparticles, all those particles would be the same.Kelvin went on to explain that “vortices” of energy can form differentsubstances because there can obviously be many different types of vortices –different sizes, speeds, and so on. Within ten years or so most physicistsaccepted Kelvin’s view that atoms are vortices; it simply seemed to make sense.In 1882 a brilliant twenty-six-year-old Cambridge scientist, J. J. Thomson (norelation to William Thomson), won a prize for a paper on the motion of vortexrings. Yet fifteen years later, Thomson’s discovery of the electron apparentlymade Kelvin’s vortex theory obsolete. Kelvin himself intensely disliked the “newphysics” that arose from the study of the disintegration of radioactiveparticles and declined to believe that atoms could fall apart.The discovery of the electron led to quantum physics, to the theory ofrelativity, and, eventually, to the “discovery” of subelectronic particles likequarks – all of which seemed to make the vortex theory doubly irrelevant.In 1968 a twenty-year-old science student at Kelvin’s old university, Belfast,went to see his professor of zoology, Dr G. Owen. The student’s name was DavidAsh, and he was thinking of transferring from physics and zoology to medicine.He expected some resistance and was startled when his professor showed him to achair and then strode about the room delivering a diatribe on the way young menbelieve everything their elders tell them. All they cared about, he complained,was getting a degree and a good job. Learning for the sheer joy of learning hadvanished.When Ash left the professor’s study, he was fired with sudden determination. Hewould stop thinking about a career and devote himself to real learning – toinventing theories and exploring ideas for the sheer joy of it. Fortunately, hisfather, Dr Michael Ash, was the author of some highly unorthodox theories ofmedicine and raised no serious objection. After a period as a science teacher,Ash became a consultant on nutrition and alternative medicine and devoted allhis spare time to developing his own unorthodox theories of the nature ofmatter, based on an idea that he called “primordial spin” – or vortices. He hadcome across the idea in a physics textbook printed in America in 1904 thatchampioned Kelvin’s “outmoded” idea. In due course, Ash joined forces with ayoung science graduate, Peter Hewitt, to argue these ideas in a book entitledScience of the Gods – which, in spite of its catchpenny title, is a seriousattempt to create a theory of the nature of matter that can transcend theserious limitations of contemporary science.One of the most irritating of these limitations must be obvious to any reader ofthis book: that science seems incapable of dealing with certain fundamentalmysteries of human existence. You and I have no idea of where we were a hundredyears ago and where we shall be a hundred years hence. It is a real question,and it is as important as anything we could ask; yet science regards it as apseudoquestion. Neither can modern science deal with such mysteries asprecognition – glimpses of the future – second sight – glimpses of things thatare happening elsewhere – or out-of-the-body experiences. If it humbly admittedthat these are at present beyond its range, there would be no problem. But itinsists that these problems do not exist, that they are simply a sign of humangullibility and self-deception. Yet anyone who has taken a serious look at theseproblems knows this to be escapist nonsense.In the 1870s a group of British scientists and philosophers decided to form asociety that would study claims about ghosts and life after death; in 1882 itwas launched under the title The Society for Psychical Research. Most of itsmembers – scientists like J. J. Thomson, literary men like Tennyson and MarkTwain, and statesmen like Gladstone – were skeptics but were willing to admitthat there was something here that needed explaining. Lewis Carroll wrote: “Thattrickery will not do as a complete explanation of all the phenomena . . . I ammore than convinced”. He thought that perhaps spirits could be explained as someunknown natural force “allied to electricity”. By the 1890s the Society had madeimportant investigations of ghosts, out-of-the-body experiences, and telepathyand had proved beyond all doubt that – as Carroll suspected – they could not beexplained as trickery. But at that point they got stuck. All their hopes ofturning the “paranormal” into a science melted away like ghosts at cockcrow.And, more than a century later, the position is still unchanged. As far asscience is concerned, the paranormal does not exist – or is, at best, a kind ofcrank fringe activity.That is why David Ash and Peter Hewitt are asking one of the most important andrelevant of all scientific questions: can some new approach provide science andthe paranormal with a common foundation?In the third chapter of their book, they raise the question of “the key to thesupernatural”. Energy, they say, is the prime reality. But is our physicaluniverse the only reality? If matter and light are two forms of energy (asEinstein showed), is it not possible that there are other forms of energy,so-called nonmaterial forms? To anyone interested in the paranormal, the answeris obviously yes. The entity known as the poltergeist has been proved to havethe ability to make solid objects pass through walls (so that, for example, inone case a picture fell out of its frame without either breaking the glass orthe sealed cardboard at the back of the frame). Neither matter nor light canpass through solid walls; ergo, some other form of energy must exist.If, as Kelvin believed, matter is made up of “vortices” or whirlpools, what arethese whirlpools in? Ash replies that the very question is based on amisconception. Before Einstein, scientists believed that light was a vibrationin the “ether” – an unknown fluid that pervades all space. Two physicists namedMichelson and Morley showed that the “ether” does not exist. Light seems to be“pure movement”, not a movement in something. A simple illustration mightclarify this idea. Suppose I toss a book across the room – as I am alwaystossing books from my worktable onto the camp bed that serves as a halfway houseto the bookshelf, while the book is in motion, it remains in every way the samebook; a tiny Martian scientist sitting on it would detect no differencewhatever. Yet its motion is undoubtedly real. You must regard its motion as akind of invisible additive. Now try to imagine this invisible additive on itsown. It is impossible, of course; but that does not prove that it cannot exist.When you look at the night sky you cannot imagine space going on forever; yetcommon sense tells you it does, even beyond the edge of the universe. Ash issuggesting that, just as energy is more “fundamental” than matter, so “puremovement” is more fundamental than energy.So why should energy be restricted to the speed of light? Ash writes: “Ifmovement could have a faster speed, it would give rise to a completely differenttype of energy”. This he calls super-energy. (In fact, physicists have suggestedin recent years the possibility of a particle called the tachyon, which isfaster than light.)According to Ash: “Objects of super-energy would share the same form as thingsin our world, but their substance would be entirely different”. They wouldactually coexist with our physical world but would be, under normalcircumstances, undetectable. And this, Ash suggests, could be the explanation ofghosts, poltergeists, “miracles” (like those of the Hindu guru Sai Baba, who can“materialize” objects out of thin air), precognition, and all other so-calledparanormal phenomena.The skeptic will ask: does Ash’s suggestion bring us any closer to understandingthe paranormal? In a sense, yes, it does. Most scientific theories begin as anattempt to explain some puzzling phenomenon, such as thunder and lightning. Thesuper-energy theory can certainly help to explain a wide variety of “paranormal”phenomena.Let us begin with an extremely simple one: dowsing. A “diviner” can hold aforked twig in his hands and detect underground water. This can be explained inpurely electrical terms. Moving water produces a weak electric field, and men –and animals – seem to have an inbuilt sensitivity to this field – obviously partof our survival mechanism.A Cambridge don named T. C. (“Tom”) Lethbridge, who was also an archaeologist,often used his own dowsing abilities to detect buried objects. He alsodiscovered that a pendulum – a weight on a piece of string – worked just as wellas a dowsing rod – the pendulum would swing in a circle over things he waslooking for. He then made another discovery that sounds absurd but that alldowsers will verify: that he could “ask the pendulum questions” and that itwould reply in the negative or affirmative by swinging back and forth or in acircle. The theory advanced by scientists – like Sir William Barrett – is thatthe unconscious mind knows the answer and causes the muscles to make thependulum move in a circle or a “swing”.During his Cambridge days, Lethbridge used the pendulum to explore a giantCeltic figure cut in a hillside but now buried beneath the turf.28[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2239529] And after hisretirement to an old house in Devon, he continued his investigations into the“power of the pendulum”. Instead of a short pendulum, he tried a pendulum madeof a long piece of string, which he was able to shorten or lengthen by windingit round a stick. His first experiment was to place a silver dish on the floorand then to hold the pendulum over it and carefully unwind the string. When itreached 22 inches, it went into a circular swing. He tried it over copper; thiswent into a circular swing at 30½ inches. He now tried the 30½ -inch pendulum inhis garden and soon unearthed a small copper tube with it.So far, Lethbridge was merely “proving” that different metals caused thependulum to respond at different lengths. He next proved to his satisfactionthat all substances have their characteristic “rate” (length of the pendulumswing): oak (11 inches), mercury (12½ ), grass (16), lead (22 – the same assilver), potatoes (39). Many substances, of course, “share” a rate with others,but Lethbridge found that the weight “circled” a distinct number of times foreach – for example, sixteen times for lead and twenty-two for silver.Now certain that he was on to something of scientific importance, he became moreambitious. One of the strangest and most absurd phenomena connected with thependulum is “map dowsing”. It sounds preposterous, but a good dowser can locatewater by swinging his pendulum over a map. At this point we have to leave“scientific” explanations behind, and fall back on ESP (extrasensory perception)or on the powers of the unconscious mind. Lethbridge reasoned that if thependulum is equally at home with an abstraction like a map, it should be at homewith abstractions in general – love, anger, evolution, death. It ought, forexample, to have a different rate for male and female. He and his wife, Mina,tried throwing stones against a wall; then he tested them with the pendulum.Those Mina had thrown reacted at 29 inches, those Lethbridge had thrown at 22.These, it seemed, were the “rates” for male and female.Other stones – sling stones from an Iron Age fort – showed a reaction at 40inches. Could it be that the stones had been thrown in the course of battle, and40 was the rate for anger? Lethbridge set his pendulum at 40 inches and thoughtof something that annoyed him; it immediately began to swing in a circle.So Lethbridge had established, at least to his own satisfaction, that emotionsand ideas, as well as substances, caused the pendulum to react at a definiterate. The rate for death was 40, and this was also the rate for black, cold,anger, deceit, and sleep – obviously connected ideas. When he drew a circledivided into 40 compartments, and placed each quality or object in itsappropriate compartment, he found that “opposite” qualities occurred where youwould expect to find them: safety at 9, danger at 29, pleasant smells at 7,unpleasant smells at 27, and so on.In a moment of idleness, he tried placing the substances at their appropriatedistance from the centre – sulphur at 7 inches along line 7, chlorine 9 inchesalong line 9, and so on – then joined up the dots with a line – which was, ofcourse, a spiral. Spirals (vortices) seem to play an important part in mostprimitive religions; they are found carved on rocks all over the world. Thevortex obviously embodies some important primitive idea. And now, looking at hisown spiral, it struck Lethbridge that a spiral can go on indefinitely. Whyshould the “dowsing spiral” stop at 40?So Lethbridge proceeded to experiment with the pendulum extended beyond 40inches. And he discovered that every substance now reacted at its “normal” rate,plus 40; sulphur at 43½ , silver at 62, and so on. There was one smalldifference. If he held a 43½ -inch pendulum over a heap of sulphur, it reactedmost strongly slightly to one side of the heap; the same applied to everythingelse he tested. It was as if, in this realm beyond 40, energies were slightlydiffracted, like a stone at the bottom of a fish tank that appears slightly toone side of its proper position.When the pendulum was extended beyond 80, all the same effects occurred again,including the “diffraction effect”. And when it was extended beyond 120, it wasthe same all over again.Lethbridge’s deduction from these observations may sound totally arbitrary,although in his books he makes it sound reasonable enough: that since 40 is the“rate” for death, then the pendulum beyond 40 is reacting to a level of reality“beyond death” and to yet another level at 80, another at 120, and so on,possibly ad infinitum. (He found it impossible to test a pendulum at more than120 inches because it was too long.)One of the oddities that Lethbridge observed is that in “our” world – below 40 –there is no “rate” for time; this is presumably because we are in it, and sotime appears “stationary”, as a stream would to a boat drifting along it. At thesecond level – beyond 40 – time “registers” at 60 inches but – oddly enough –seems to have no forward motion. (I do not profess to understand what he meant.)Then, in the world beyond 80, time disappears again.Lethbridge concluded that many “worlds” coexist on different “vibration rates”.We cannot see the world “beyond 40” because it moves too fast for us, so tospeak, just as you cannot read the name of a station if the train goes throughit too fast. But some people – “psychics” – are better at reading fast-movingwords, so to speak, and keep catching glimpses of the next level of reality.Lethbridge is of interest in this context because he did not begin as anoccultist but as an archaeologist trained in scientific method. The notion of“other realities” forced itself upon him little by little, as a result ofexperiences that he found hard to explain. He always declined to go further thanthe facts would allow, but the facts often forced him to go further than hewanted. Personal experience convinced him, for example, of the reality ofghosts, poltergeists, and what he called “ghouls” – unpleasant sensationsassociated with certain places where tragedies have occurred. Yet he preferredto believe that these could be explained in terms of “tape recording” –“imprints” of human emotions on some kind of electrical field.Lethbridge died in 1971, but he would undoubtedly have approved of David Ash’svortex theory and of the notion that paranormal events can be explained in termsof super-energy (or, as he would have said, higher vibrational rates). He wouldprobably have added that each level of reality has its own level of super-energyand that there is no obvious limit to the number of levels.This notion of levels is fundamental to occultism. Madame Blavatsky taught thatthere are seven levels of reality, the first three of a descending order and thelast three of an ascending order. Earth is situated at the bottom, at levelfour, the “heaviest” and densest of all levels. Yet the sheer density of mattermeans that human beings are capable of greater achievement than on any otherlevel – just as a sculptor can create more permanent works of art out of marblethan out of clay.Another thinker who attempted to bridge the gap between science and theparanormal was Arthur Young, inventor of the Bell helicopter.29[CR%214WW7VXJHH94XSEAEPXY3TVH9YCV3_split_071.html#filepos2239793] In books suchas The Reflexive Universe, Young also speculated that there are “seven levels ofexistence”, which include (in order) subatomic particles, atoms, molecules,plants, animals, humans, and what might be called “true humans”, or human beingswho have moved to the next evolutionary stage. This seventh level is also thatof light.To most scientists, such speculations will sound suspiciously “mystical”. Yetthe most interesting scientific development of the second half of the twentiethcentury has been the recognition by scientists themselves that some of theimplications of relativity physics and quantum theory are “mystical”. Considerthe strange paradox of the “photon that interferes with itself” (for the sake ofbrevity I will quote my own book, Beyond the Occult):> If I shine a beam of light through a pinhole it will form a circle of light on> a screen (or photographic plate). If two pinholes are opened up side by side,> the result – as you might expect – is two overlapping circles of light. But on> the overlapping portions there are a number of dark lines. These are due to> the “interference” of the two beams – the same effect you would get if two> fast streams of traffic shot out on to the same roundabout. Now suppose the> beam is dimmed so only one photon at a time can pass through either of the> holes. When the image finally builds up on the photographic plate you would> expect the interference bands to disappear. Instead, they are there as usual.> But how can one photon at a time interfere with itself? And how does a photon> flying through one hole “know” that the other hole is open? Could it possess> telepathy, as Einstein jokingly suggested? . . . Perhaps the photon splits and> goes through both holes? But a photon detector reveals that this is not so:> only one photon at a time goes through one hole at a time. Yet, oddly enough,> as soon as we begin to “watch” the photons, they cease to interfere, and the> dark bands vanish. The likeliest explanation is that the photon is behaving> like a wave when it is unobserved, and so goes through both holes, and> interferes. The moment we try to watch it, it turns into a hard ball.> > In 1957 a Princeton physicist named Hugh Everett III suggested an apparentlypreposterous idea to explain this apparent paradox. The “wave” we call a quantumis not a real wave. We impose reality on it because our minds work that way. Itis a “wave of possibilities”. (Heisenberg’s famous “uncertainty principle” –that you cannot know both the speed and the position of a photon – and theamusing paradox of Schrödinger’s cat – that a cat in a box can be neither deadnor alive, but in an “intermediate” state – are examples of the same notion.) Ifthe two “holes” can somehow interfere with each other, even though there is onlyone photon, then the two alternative paths of the electron must exist side byside, so to speak. But where? Everett suggested that one of them exists in aparallel “alternative universe”. In these parallel universes (or perhaps theyare just different ways of seeing the same universe), a tossed coin could comedown heads in one and tails in the other. A wave is actually two particles intwo different worlds – or rather, many different worlds, for every “alternative”splits into two more, and so on.Anyone who finds this idea absurd should study Parallel Universes (1988) by thephysicist Fred Alan Wolf, in which the implications of the theory are developedin all their Alice-in-Wonderland complexity. The physicist Sir Fred Hoyle hassuggested that the paradoxes of quantum physics can be explained only if weassume that future possibilities can somehow influence the present and thattherefore, in some very real sense, the future has already taken place – apossibility that is already familiar to all students of precognition – thosesudden flashes of foreknowledge of the future.Clearly, the need to find a deeper foundation that can embrace science and the“paranormal” is one of the most vital notions that has emerged during thetwentieth century. Yet obviously, even this way of expressing it perpetuates themisunderstanding, since it speaks of science and the paranormal as if they wereseparate entities, rather than part of the same whole. The philosopher EdmundHusserl was struggling toward the same insight in his last book, The Crisis inthe European Sciences, when he pointed out that the Greeks had divided realityinto the world of the physically real and the world of ideas. Galileo thentaught scientists how to handle this physical world in terms of mathematics, andsuddenly science was confined to the world of physical reality. And sincescientists declined to admit any other reality, science became oddly lopsided.(This is what Alfred North Whitehead meant when he accused science of“bifurcating” nature, dividing reality into the “solid” realm of physics and the– comparatively unimportant – realm of lived experience, which includes art,religion, and philosophy.) Husserl argued that we have to take a stand against“scientific reality” and rethink science until it can comfortably include thefull range of our human reality. Husserl, of course, was not remotely interestedin the paranormal, and his work is doubly important because it shows how aphilosopher (who began his career with a book on mathematics) can reach the samephilosophical conclusions closely related to those of Lethbridge or David Ashfrom the other end, so to speak.In Science of the Gods, Ash and Hewitt have made a brave attempt to show how thevortex theory can explain many kinds of “psychic phenomena” in scientific terms,from ghosts and miracles to reincarnation and UFOs. It is an exciting andimaginative program that – inevitably – falls short of its objective. But atleast it makes us aware that when Kelvin had his flash of “vision” in 1867 anddeveloped it into the vortex theory of atoms, he may have laid the foundationfor a new and more comprehensive science of reality."},{"pageContent":"61 Who Was Harry Whitecliffe?According to a book published in France in 1978, one of England’s mostextraordinary mass murderers committed suicide in a Berlin gaol in the middle ofthe jazz era. His name was Harry Whitecliffe, and he murdered at least fortywomen. Then why is his name not more widely known – at least to students ofcrime? Because when he was arrested he was masquerading under the name LovachBlume, and his suicide concealed his true identity from the authorities.The full story can be found in a volume called Nouvelles Histoires Magiques –New Tales of Magic – by Louis Pauwels and Guy Breton, published by Editions J’aiLu. In spite of the title – which sounds like fiction – it is in fact a seriesof studies in the paranormal and bizarre; there are chapters on Nostradamus,Rasputin and Eusapia Palladino, and accounts of such well-known mysteries as thedevil’s footprints in Devon (see my chapter 12).According to the chapter “The Two Faces of Harry Whitecliffe”, there appeared inLondon in the early twenties a collection of essays so promising that it soldout in a few days; it consisted of a series of marvellous pastiches of OscarWilde. But its author, Harry Whitecliffe, apparently preferred to shunpublicity; he remained obstinately hidden. Would-be interviewers returnedempty-handed. Then, just as people were beginning to suggest that Whitecliffewas a pseudonym for some well-known writer – Bernard Shaw, perhaps, or the youngT.S. Eliot – Whitecliffe finally consented to appear. He was a handsome youngman of twenty-three, likeable, eccentric and fond of sport. He was alsogenerous; he was said to have ended one convivial evening by casually giving apretty female beggar five hundred pounds. He professed to adore flowers, butonly provided their stems were not more than twenty centimetres long. He was thekind of person the English love, and was soon a celebrity.Meanwhile he continued to write: essays, poetry and plays. One of his comedies,Similia, had four hundred consecutive performances in London before touringEngland. It made him a fortune, which he quickly scattered among his friends. Bythe beginning of 1923 he was one of the “kings of London society”.Then, in September of that year, he vanished. He sold all his possessions, andgave his publisher carte blanche to handle his work. But before the end of theyear he reappeared in Dresden. The theatre there presented Similia with enormoussuccess, the author himself translating it from English into German. It went onto appear in many theatres along the Rhine. He founded a press for publishingmodern poetry, and works on modern painting – Dorian Verlag – whose editions arenow worth a fortune.But he was still something of a man of mystery. Every morning he galloped alongthe banks of the river Elbe until nine o’clock; at ten he went to his office,eating lunch there. At six in the evening, he went to art exhibitions orliterary salons, and met friends. At nine, he returned home and no one knew whathe did for the rest of the evening. And no one liked to ask him.One reason for this regular life was that he was in love – the girl was calledWally von Hammerstein, daughter of aristocratic parents, who were favourablyimpressed with the young writer. Their engagement was to be announced on 4October 1924.But on the previous day Whitecliffe disappeared again. He failed to arrive athis office, and vanished from his flat. The frantic Wally searched Dresden,without success. The police were alerted – discreetly – and pursued diligentinquiries. Their theory was that he had committed suicide. Wally believed he hadeither met with an accident or been the victim of a crime – he often carriedlarge sums of money. As the weeks dragged by her desperation turned to misery;she talked about entering a convent.Then she received a letter. It had been found in the cell of a condemned man whohad committed suicide in Berlin – he had succeeded in opening his veins with thebuckle of his belt. The inscription on the envelope said: “I beg you, monsieurle procureur of the Reich, to forward this letter to its destination withoutopening it.” It was signed: Lovach Blume.Blume was apparently one of the most horrible of murderers, worse than Jack theRipper or Peter Kürten, the Düsseldorf sadist. He had admitted to the court thattried him: “Every ten days I have to kill. I am driven by an irresistible urge,so that until I have killed, I suffer atrociously. But as I disembowel myvictims I feel an indescribable pleasure.” Asked about his past, he declared: “Iam a corpse. Why bother about the past of a corpse”?Blume’s victims were prostitutes and homeless girls picked up on the Berlinstreets. He would take them to a hotel, and kill them as soon as they wereundressed. Then, with a knife like a Malaysian “kriss”, with an ivory handle, hewould perform horrible mutilations, so awful that even doctors found the sightunbearable. These murders continued over a period of six months, during whichthe slum quarters of Berlin lived in fear.Blume was finally arrested by accident, in September 1924. The police thought hewas engaged in drug trafficking, and knocked on the door of a hotel room minutesafter Blume had entered with a prostitute. Blume had just committed histhirty-first murder in Berlin; he was standing naked by the window, and thewoman’s body lay at his feet.He made no resistance, and admitted freely to his crimes – he could only recalltwenty-seven. He declared that he had no fear of death – particularly the wayexecutions were performed in Germany (by decapitation), which he greatlypreferred to the English custom of hanging.This was the man who had committed suicide in his prison cell, and who addresseda long letter to his fiancée, Wally von Hammerstein. He told her that he wascertain the devil existed, because he had met him. He was, he explained, a kindof Jekyll and Hyde, an intelligent, talented man who suddenly became cruel andbloodthirsty. He thought of himself as being like victims of demoniacalpossession. He had left London after committing nine murders, when he suspectedthat Scotland Yard was on his trail. His love for Wally was genuine, he toldher, and had caused him to “die a little”. He had hoped once that she might beable to save him from his demons, but it had proved a vain hope.Wally fainted as she read the letter. And in 1925 she entered a nunnery and tookthe name Marie de Douleurs. There she prays for the salvation of a tortured soul. . .This is the story, as told by Louis Pauwels – a writer who became famous for hiscollabouration with Jacques Bergier on a book called The Morning of theMagicians. Critics pointed out that that book was full of factual errors, and anumber of these can also be found in his article on Whitecliffe. For example, ifthe date of Blume’s arrest is correct – 25 September 1924 – then it took placebefore Whitecliffe vanished from Dresden, on 3 October 1924 . . . But this,presumably, is a slip of the pen.But who was Harry Whitecliffe? According to Pauwels, he told the Berlin courtthat his father was German, his mother Danish, and that he was brought up inAustralia by an uncle who was a butcher. His uncle lived in Sydney. But in a“conversation” between Pauwels and his fellow-author at the end of one chapter,Pauwels states that Whitecliffe was the son of a great English family. But apartfrom the three magistrates who opened the suicide letter – ignoring Blume’s lastwishes – only Wally and her parents knew Whitecliffe’s true identity. The judgesare dead, so are Wally’s parents. Wally is a 75-year-old nun who until now hasnever told anyone of this drama of her youth. We are left to assume that she hasnow told the story to Pauwels.This extraordinary tale aroused the curiosity of a well-known French authoress,Françoise d’Eaubonne, who felt that Whitecliffe deserved a book to himself. Buther letters to the two authors – Pauwels and Breton – went unanswered. Shetherefore contacted the British Society of Theatre Research, and so entered intoa correspondence with the theatre historian John Kennedy Melling. Melling hadnever heard of Whitecliffe, or of a play called Similia. He decided to begin hisresearches by contacting Scotland Yard, to ask whether they have any record ofan unknown sex killer of the early 1920s. Their reply was negative; there was noseries of Ripper-type murders of prostitutes in the early 1920s. He next appliedto J.H.H. Gaute, the possessor of the largest crime library in the BritishIsles; Gaute could also find no trace of such a series of sex crimes in the1920s. Theatrical reference books contained no mention of Harry Whitecliffe, orof his successful comedy Similia. It began to look – as incredible as it sounds– as if Pauwels had simply invented the whole story.Thelma Holland, Oscar Wilde’s daughter-in-law, could find no trace of a volumeof parodies of Wilde among the comprehensive collection of her late husband,Vyvyan Holland. But she had a suggestion to make – to address inquiries to theMitchell Library in Sydney. As an Australian, she felt it was probably Melling’sbest chance of tracking down Harry Whitecliffe.Incredibly, this long shot brought positive results: not about HarryWhitecliffe, but about a German murderer called Blume – not Lovach, but WilhelmBlume. The Argus newspaper for 8 August 1922 contained a story headed “CulturedMurderer”, and sub-titled: “Literary Man’s Series of Crimes”. It was datelinedBerlin, 7 August.> Wilhelm Blume, a man of wide culture and considerable literary gifts, whose> translations of English plays have been produced in Dresden with great> success, has confessed to a series of cold-blooded murders, one of which was> perpetrated at the Hotel Adlon, the best known Berlin hotel.> > The most significant item in the newspaper report is that Blume had founded apublishing house called Dorian Press (Verlag) in Dresden. This is obviously thesame Blume who – according to Pauwels – committed suicide in Berlin.But Wilhelm Blume was not a sex killer. His victims had been postmen, and themotive had been robbery. In Germany postal orders were paid to consignees intheir own homes, so postmen often carried fairly large sums of money. Blume hadsent himself postal orders, then killed the postmen and robbed them – the exactnumber is not stated in the Argus article. The first time he did this he wasinterrupted by his landlady while he was strangling the postman with a noose;and he cut her throat. Then he moved on to Dresden, where in due course heattempted to rob another postman. Armed with two revolvers, he waited for thepostman in the porch of a house. But the tenant of the house arrived so promptlythat he had to flee, shooting one of the policemen. Then his revolvers bothmisfired, and he was caught. Apparently he attempted to commit suicide inprison, but failed. He confessed – as the Argus states – to several murders, andwas presumably executed later in 1922 (although the Argus carries no furtherrecord).It seems plain, then, that the question “Who was Harry Whitecliffe”? should bereworded “Who was Wilhelm Blume”? For Blume and Whitecliffe were obviously thesame person.From the information we possess, we can make a tentative reconstruction of thestory of Blume-Whitecliffe. He sounds like a typical example of a certain typeof killer who is also a confidence man – other examples are Landru, Petiot, the“acid bath murderer” Haigh, and the sex killer Neville Heath. It is an essentialpart of such a man’s personality that he is a fantasist, and that he likes topose as a success, and to talk casually about past triumphs. (Neville Heathcalled himself “Group Captain Rupert Brooke”.) They usually start off as pettyswindlers, then gradually become more ambitious, and graduate to murder. This iswhat Blume seems to have done. In the chaos of postwar Berlin he made a quickfortune by murdering and robbing postmen. Perhaps his last coup made him afortune beyond his expectations, or perhaps the Berlin postal authorities werenow on the alert for the killer. Blume decided it was time to make an attempt tolive a respectable life, and to put his literary fantasies into operation. Hemoved to Dresden, called himself Harry Whitecliffe and set up Dorian Verlag. Hebecame a successful translator of English plays, and may have helped to financetheir production in Dresden and in theatres along the Rhine. Since he was posingas an upper-class Englishman, and must have occasionally run into otherEnglishmen in Dresden, we may assume that his English was perfect, and that hisstory of being brought up in Australia was probably true. Since he also spokeperfect German, it is also a fair assumption that he was, as he told the court,the son of a German father and a Danish mother.He fell in love with an upper-class girl, and told her a romantic story that istypical of the inveterate daydreamer: that he was the son of a “great Englishfamily”, that he had become an overnight literary success in London as a resultof his pastiches of Oscar Wilde, but had at first preferred to shun thelimelight (this is the true Walter Mitty touch) until increasing success madethis impossible. His wealth is the result of a successful play, Similia. (Thesimilarity of the title to Salome is obvious, and we may infer that Blume was anardent admirer of Wilde.) But in order to avoid too much publicity – after all,victims of previous swindles might expose him – he lives the quiet, regular lifeof a crook in hiding.And just as all seems to be going so well – just as success, respectability, ahappy marriage, seem so close – he once again runs out of money. There is onlyone solution: a brief return to a life of crime. One or two robberies of postmencan replenish his bank account and secure his future . . . But this time it goesdisastrously wrong. Harry Whitecliffe is exposed as the swindler and murdererWilhelm Blume. He makes no attempt to deny it, and confesses to his previousmurders; his world has now collapsed in ruins. He is sent back to Berlin, wherethe murders were committed, and he attempts suicide in his cell. Soon after, hedies by the guillotine. And in Dresden the true story of Wilhelm Blume is soonembroidered into a horrifying tale of a Jekyll-and-Hyde mass murderer, whoseearly career in London is confused with Jack the Ripper . . .Do any records of Wilhelm Blume still exist? It seems doubtful – thefire-bombing of Dresden destroyed most of the civic records, and the people whoknew him more than sixty years ago must now all be dead. Yet Pauwels hasobviously come across some garbled and wildly inaccurate account of Blume’scareer as Harry Whitecliffe. It would be interesting to know where he obtainedhis information; but neither Françoise d’Eaubonne nor John Kennedy Melling havebeen successful in persuading him to answer letters."},{"pageContent":"62 Patience WorthOr the Ghost Who Wrote NovelsOn an August day in 1912 two women sat in a house in St Louis, Missouri, andplayed with an ouija board. They were Emily Grant Hutchings and Pearl Curran,and both were married to successful businessmen – their husbands were in factplaying cards in the next room. It was Mrs Hutchings who was interested intrying to “contact the spirits”; her friend Pearl Curran thought it was all awaste of time. And on that first August afternoon she proved to be right. Thepointer of the ouija board spelt out a few recognizable words, but it was mostlynonsense.But in spite of her friend’s boredom, Emily Hutchings insisted on trying again.They tried repeatedly over the next ten months. And finally, on 22 June 1913,the board spelled out the word PAT several times, then went on to write:> > Oh, why let sorrow steel thy heart?> > > > Thy bosom is but its foster-mother,> > > > The world its cradle and the loving home its grave.> > > > This was not only intelligible, but intelligent – although a careful reading isrequired before it can be seen to make sense.That same afternoon the board went on to utter a number of similar sentiments,most of which sound like the utterances of a sentimental lady novelist of theVictorian period:“Rest, weary heart. Let only sunshine light the shrine within. A single rayshall filter through and warm thy frozen soul”.There were several more aphoristic sentences of the same nature.The next time the ladies met was on 2 July 1913, and once again the ouija boardbegan spelling out words with bewildering speed. “Dust rests beneath, and webslie caught among the briars. A single jewel gleams as a mirrored vision ofrising Venus in a mountain lake . . .” And after more poetic sentiments of thesame kind, it declared: “All those who so lately graced your board are here, andas the moon looks down, think ye of them and their abode as a spirit song, asspirit friends, and close communion held twixt thee and them. Tis but a journey,dost not see”? And when the ladies asked for some elucidation the board replied:“Tis all so clear behind the veil . . .” And when they asked its name itanswered: “Should one so near be confined to a name? The sun shines alike on thebriar and the rose . . .” But at the next session, six days later, it finallycondescended to reveal its identity. “Many moons ago I lived. Again I come –Patience Worth my name”. But she seemed reluctant to disclose more details.“About me you would know much. Yesterday is dead”. And she was inclined toexpress herself in aphorisms; at a later séance, when they asked her to hurryup, she replied: “Beat the hound and lose the hare.” She had a sharp tongue anda ready wit, although the old-fashioned language often made it difficult tounderstand. She seems to have taken a dislike to a Mrs Pollard, Pearl Curran’smother, who was present at some of the sessions, and when asked by EmilyHutchings what she thought of Mrs Pollard, replied: “The men should stock her”.Did she mean that Mrs Pollard should be put in the stocks? asked Mrs Hutchings.“Aye, and leave a place for two” snapped Patience.But shortly before Christmas Patience displayed an interesting ability topredict the future. Mrs Hutchings asked her what Pearl Curran intended to giveher for Christmas; Patience replied: “Fifteen pieces, and one cracked”. In factMrs Curran had ordered a set of kitchen jars for her friend, and when they weredelivered the next day one of the fifteen proved to be cracked. Asked what EmilyHutchings intended to give Pearl Curran for Christmas, Patience answered: “Tablestore, cross-stitched”. Again this was accurate – she had bought somecross-stitched table linen. Asked by Mrs Pollard for an inscription for apresent to her daughter, Patience replied: “A burning desire never to besnuffed; a waxing faith, ever to burn”. It was remarkably appropriate: MrsPollard had bought her daughter a candle and snuffer.Eventually Patience offered a little more information about herself. She was aQuaker girl, born either in 1649 or 1694 (the board dictated 1649, then changedits mind and added 94) and had been born in Dorset. She had worked hard –apparently on a farm – until her family emigrated to America, and had shortlythereafter been killed by Indians. She was certainly a talkative lady – even theincomplete records of the sessions with her, cited in The Case of Patience Worthby Walter Franklin Prince, are exhausting to read. And she was inclined todictate lengthy “poems” which lack rhyme and show an uncertainty about metre.Her best-known utterance runs as follows:> > Ah God, I have drunk unto the dregs,> > > > And flung the cup at Thee!> > > > The dust of crumbled righteousness> > > > Hath dried and soaked unto itself> > > > E’en the drop I spilled to Bacchus,> > > > Whilst Thou, all-patient,> > > > Sendest purple vintage for a later harvest.> > > > This has most of the characteristics of Patience’s literary utterances. On firstreading, it seems meaningless; on a second or third reading, it yields up itsmeaning. But the reader may be left in some doubt as to whether it was worthsaying in the first place.In 1915 Patience became something of a celebrity when Caspar Yost, the editor ofthe Sunday supplement of the St Louis Globe-Democrat, wrote a series of articlesabout her, although he was careful not to identify the two ladies who had“discovered” her. The articles caused a sensation, and Yost went on to write abook. Another St Louis journalist, William Marion Reedy, editor of Reedy’sMirror – and one of the best literary critics of his time also attended some ofthe séances, and to his own astonishment was much impressed by Patience. Yostand Reedy were responsible for making the name of Patience Worth known all overAmerica.By now Patience had embarked upon more ambitious literary composition. Firstcame Red Wing, a six-act medieval play. Next there was a 60,000 word medievalnovel, Telka. And here it must be admitted at once that Patience is adisappointing writer. If the works were literary masterpieces, or even highlycompetent hack-work, they would deserve to be kept permanently in print. Infact, they are so long-winded as to be almost unreadable. “Historical” novelslike Telka and The Sorry Tale (set in the time of Jesus) are written in an“archaic” style that demands close attention and offers no adequate reward. Thisis from The Sorry Tale: “And his beard hung low upon his breast, and he spokeunto the Rome’s men: ‘The peace of Jehovah be upon you’ And they spat upon hisfruits and made loud words, saying: ‘Behold, Jerusalem hath been beset oflocusts and desert fleas . . .’” It reads like second-rate Biblical pastiches. A‘modern’ novel, Hope Trueblood, begins: “The glass had slipped thrice, and thesands stood midway through, and still the bird hopped within its wicker. I thinkthe glass had slipped through a score of years, rightfully set at each turning,and the bird had sung through some of these and mourned through others. Thehearth’s arch yawned sleepily . . .” And after half a page of this the reader isalso yawning sleepily.Certainly Patience seems to have known little of the virtue of brevity. When apsychic named Arthur Delroy addressed a meeting in St Louis he remarked that theouija board was of no more value than a doorknob, and that Patience’s languagewas not archaic English but the kind of language learned at Sunday school. (Headded unkindly that he would not be surprised to learn that Mrs Curran had spenta great deal of time at Sunday school.) When this was reported to Patience, shereplied: “Tis fools that smite the lute and set it awhir o’folly song, whensage’s hand do be at loth to touch.” To this Delroy replied, in Patience’s ownstyle: “Nay, thou puttest me among the nobles. I be not the wise man from theEast who wouldst prithee never be the last word, but wouldsy patiently wait,yea, t’ll’st the millionth Patient utterance . . .” Her reply, if she made one,is not recorded.In November 1915 Mr and Mrs Curran decided to go to the east coast, wherePatience was widely known, and to take the ouija board. Asked if she was willingto accompany them, Patience replied in her usual long-winded style: “E’en asdoth the breath o’ thee to hug, so shall I, to follow thee. Think ye I’d buildme a cup and leave it dry”? And when Patience was interviewed by the eminentpsychologist Morton Prince in Boston he also found her wordiness rather trying.Asked if she objected to the investigation, she replied at inordinate length,beginning: “Ye be at seek o’ a measure o’ smoke’s put . . .” He repeated thequestion, and Patience explained lucidly: “Ye turn up a stone, ayea, and aneaththere be a toad, aye, and he blinketh him at the light . . .” And when Prince indesperation repeated the question a third time, she explained: “Here be a onewho hath ’o a ball o’ twine and be not a satisfied with the ball, but doth toawish that I do awind it out. List thee, brother, at thy poke aneath the stone!Tis well and alike unto me.” And hours of interrogation brought forth a greatmany more of these labyrinthine obscurities. Patience seems incapable of usingone word where ten will do, bringing to mind Lincoln’s remark: “He can compressthe most words into the smallest ideas of any man I ever met.” It was impossibleto get her to answer even the simplest question with a direct reply. When Princeasked her how old she was when she came to America, she replied: “A goodlydame”, and when he repeated the question, advised him to look at a parable shehad written about an ass. Patience herself ended the interview – the last – withan abrupt “Good night.”Prince’s feeling was that they had been basically a waste of time. Whether ornot Patience was genuine, she was certainly evasive. Mrs Curran flatly refusedPrince’s suggestion that she should be hypnotized, and the Currans gave to thenewspapers an account of the interviews that struck Prince as inaccurate,leading to some bad-tempered exchanges.After this unsatisfactory encounter, the Currans went on to New York, wherePatience met her future publisher Henry Holt, and rambled on in her usualinfuriatingly prolix manner. But Holt was impressed, and in the followingFebruary – 1916 – brought out Caspar Yost’s book Patience Worth – A PsychicMystery, which met, on the whole, with an excellent reception. Critics describedPatience as a “powerful, unique but impalpable personality” and her work as“entertaining, humourous and beautiful”. But a dissenting note was sounded byProfessor James Hyslop, of the American Society for Psychical Research, whodeplored the total lack of scientifically convincing evidence, and dismissedPatience as a “fraud and a delusion”.In June 1917 Henry Holt published the vast pseudo-Biblical epic The Sorry Tale,more than a quarter of a million words long. Again, many papers were ecstatic;the Boston Transcript wrote: “If, however, on account of its psychic claims, oneapproaches the story with unbelief or scoffing, one is instantly rebuffed by itsquality”, while The Nation said that it “deserved to be weighed as a piece ofcreative fiction”. The modern reader will find these claims incomprehensible;the writing is atrocious, and often illiterate. “Sheep, storm-lost, bleated,where, out upon the hills, they lost them”. “The temples stood whited and themarket place shewed emptied.” “And the Rome’s men bared their blades and the airrocked with cries of mock prayers from Rome’s lips.” If Patience had been anambitious shop girl the novel would have been dismissed as a bad joke.On the other hand, the book seemed to indicate a knowledge of ancient Rome thatMrs Curran insisted she had never possessed. The distinguished psychicalinvestigator G.N.M. Tyrrell, writing thirty years later, said: “There is nothere the greatness of genius, but . . . there is a fount of inspiration whichmight have provided the material for a work of genius had it been expressedthrough the conscious mind of, say, a Coleridge instead of . . . Mrs Curran”,and he went on to quote Caspar Yost’s view that the book revealed an intimateknowledge of the Rome of Augustus and Tiberius, and also of the topography ofJerusalem and the Holy Land. But then, of course, Yost was a somewhat biasedwitness, having been one of the original “discoverers” of Patience Worth.One of the most bizarre episodes in the entire story began in August 1916, whileThe Sorry Tale was still being dictated. In her usual circumlocutory way,Patience announced that her works would bring in a great deal of money (“a-timea later the purse shall fatten”), but that this money “be not for him who hath”.The Currans were told “ye shall seek a one, a wee bit, one who hath not”, andadded “Aye, this be close, close.” And soon it became clear that what Patiencemeant – she seems to have been incapable of saying anything in plain words – wasthat the Currans, who were childless, should adopt a baby, and that this babywould be in some sense Patience’s own daughter. By “the merest accident”, apregnant widow was located – her husband had been killed in a mill accident –and she agreed to relinquish her unborn child to the Currans. Patience seemedquite certain it would be a daughter. And one evening, as she was dictating TheSorry Tale, Patience broke off abruptly with the comment “This be ‘nuff’”. Anhour later the Currans heard that the baby had been born. It was indeed a girl,and had red hair and brown eyes – a description Patience had formerly given ofherself. On Patience’s instructions the child was called Patience Worth WeeCurran.In that same year – 1916 – Emily Hutchings called upon the eminent literarycritic William Marion Reedy, and showed him the first ten thousand words of anovel about Missouri politics and journalism. In recent years Emily had droppedout of the limelight, for it had become clear that her presence was notessential for Patience to manifest herself. Reedy was impressed by the novel,and congratulated her. A week later he probably felt like eating his words whenEmily called again, and confessed that the novel had been “dictated” by thespirit of Mark Twain – then proceeded to produce several pages with the help ofthe ouija board. The novel was accepted, and published under the title of JapHerron, and was well received – although it was generally agreed that itsquality was much inferior to the works Mark Twain had produced while he wasalive. An effort by Mark Twain’s publishers to suppress the novel wasunsuccessful.During this period Patience’s fame continued to grow. The Victorian novel HopeTrueblood met with an enthusiastic reception from many respectable journals,although the reading public found that even Patience’s “modern” style was toowordy. In England the book was issued without any indication of its “psychic”origin, and received mixed reviews; but at least most of the critics seemed toassume that it was the first novel of an English writer. The Currans alsolaunched Patience Worth’s Magazine, to make Patience’s poems and lesser writingsaccessible to her admirers; it was edited by Caspar Yost, and ran to ten issues.But by 1918 there were signs that Patience’s vogue was coming to an end. In TheAtlantic Monthly that August a writer named Agnes Repplier poured scorn on thislatest fad for books written by spirits, and expressed dismay at the thoughtthat Patience, being dead, might be on the literary scene for ever. OfPatience’s books, Miss Repplier said tartly that “they were as silly as theywere dull”. In retrospect, it seems surprising that no other reputable critichad already made this assessment.The blast of ridicule was in effect the end of Patience Worth’s period ofliterary celebrity; Agnes Repplier had stated that the emperor was naked, andnow everybody realized that it had been obvious all along. A new book by CasparYost on Patience’s religion and philosophy was turned down by Henry Holt; so wasa volume of Patience’s poems. Pearl Curran (who had always strenuously deniedthat she had any writing talent) herself wrote a short story about a Chicagosalesgirl – who, significantly, is “taken over” by a secondary personality – andit was accepted by the Saturday Evening Post; but Pearl’s most recentbiographer, Irving Litvag, admits (in Singer in the Shadows) that the story“never rises above the level of bad soap opera”.When William Marion Reedy died in 1920 Patience lost one of her most influentialdefenders. And another sign of Patience’s sinking reputation was a hostilearticle by a critic called Mary Austin in the Unpartizan Review; what made itworse was that the magazine was published by Henry Holt.John Curran’s health began to fail, and he died in June 1922, after fourteenmonths of illness. Pearl, who was now thirty-nine years old, was pregnant withtheir first child; a girl was born six months later. Pearl had four people tosupport – herself, her mother, Patience Wee and her new daughter – on adwindling income. Far from making them a fortune, Patience’s literary works hadcost them money; the novels had sold poorly, and the magazine was an expensiveproduction. Pearl was forced to accept an offer to give several lectures inChicago; she was reluctant to do this because she had always insisted that herposition as Patience’s mouthpiece brought her no profit; but there was noalternative. The death of her mother was another blow. But at this point a NewYork admirer, Herman Behr, came to the rescue; he not only made her an allowanceof $400 a month but also paid for the publication of Patience’s poems, whichappeared under the title Light From Beyond. But it failed to revive the interestof the American reading public in the Patience Worth phenomenon. In the age ofJames Joyce and Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos, the rambling productionsof Patience Worth seemed irrelevant.Litvag comments: “The next three years were lonely, rather despairing ones forPearl Curran. No longer a celebrity, largely ignored by the public . . .periodically in ill health, she was often depressed and morose”. In 1923 sheallowed Patience Wee to go to California. In 1926 she married a retired doctor,Henry Rogers, many years her senior; but the marriage was unsuccessful, andended in divorce. In 1930 Pearl moved to California, where in Los Angeles sheonce again acquired some degree of celebrity among a group of devoted admirers.In 1931 she married again – this time to a man to whom she had been brieflyengaged when she was nineteen; she and her husband – Robert Wyman – moved toCulver City, and Patience began to dictate a new literary work, a play aboutShakespeare. At séances she continued to be as garrulous and evasive as ever –the simplest question could be guaranteed to provide a five-minute answer. In1934 Patience Wee who was eighteen married, and Patience provided a lengthyblessing, signed “Thy Mither”.Then in November 1937 Pearl, who was fifty-four, suddenly announced to her oldfriend Dotsie Smith that “Patience has just shown me the end of the road, andyou will have to carry on as best you can”. She seemed to be in excellenthealth. But on Thanksgiving Day she caught a cold; on 3 December 1937 she diedof pneumonia in a Los Angeles hospital. That was in effect the end of thePatience Worth phenomenon. Patience Wee, who by the age of twenty-seven had beentwice married, died equally suddenly in 1943, after a mild heart ailment hadbeen diagnosed; inevitably, there were those who felt that Patience had finallyclaimed her “daughter”.The last chapter of Irving Litvag’s book on Patience is entitled “Who wasPatience Worth”?, but he admits almost immediately that he has no idea. Writerson the case tend to be equally divided between the two obvious theories: thatPatience was a “secondary personality” of Pearl Curran, and that she was more orless what she claimed to be, a “spirit”. Both Morton Prince and Walter FranklinPrince (they were unrelated) had produced classic studies of cases of multiplepersonality; Morton Prince’s “Sally Beauchamp” case (described in TheDissociation of a Personality) has achieved the status of a classic; WalterFranklin Prince’s “Doris Fischer” case deserves to be equally well known, butnever achieved circulation beyond the pages of the American Journal forPsychical Research (1923) and Contributions to Psychology But anyone who readsthe Patience Worth case after studying Sally Beauchamp and Doris Fischer isbound to feel that they have very little in common. Most “multiplepersonalities” have a history of childhood abuse and misery; Pearl Curran seemsto have had a normal childhood, and to have been a perfectly ordinary,unremarkable person until the coming of Patience Worth. Although it isconceivable that Pearl Curran was a case of dual personality, the clinicalevidence for it is not particularly convincing.For those who are willing to accept the possibility of life after death, themost convincing explanation is certainly that Patience was a “spirit”. But thatdoes not necessarily mean that she was really what she claimed to be. Anyone whohas studied “spirit communication” soon recognizes that “spirits” are veryseldom what they claim to be; G.K. Chesterton put in more bluntly and said thatthey are liars. If Patience was a seventeenth-century Quaker who was killed byRed Indians, it is difficult to understand why she was so evasive and why shefailed to answer straightforward questions that might have enabled the Curransto prove that such a person really existed. Litvag’s book leaves one with theconviction that if Patience was a spirit, then it was probably the spirit of afrustrated would-be writer with a strong tendency to mythomania."},{"pageContent":"63 ZombiesThe Evidence for the Walking DeadEver since 1932, when Bela Lugosi starred in White Zombie, the zombie legend hasbeen a Hollywood standby, challenging the vampire, the walking mummy, and theFrankenstein monster in popularity. No one who has seen a film like King of theZombies can ever forget the shot of a zombie marching on like a robot whilesomeone fires bullet after bullet into its chest.Zombies, according to Alfred Metraux’s book, Voodoo (1959), are “people whosedecease has been duly recorded and whose burial has been witnessed, but who arefound a few years later . . . in a state verging on idiocy”. In Port-au-Prince,Haiti, says Metraux, “there are few, even among the educated, who do not givesome credence to these macabre stories”. Understandably, such tales have metwith skepticism outside Haiti.One of the first Western observers to record an actual incident of zombiism wasthe black ethnographer Zora Neale Hurston, who had trained in America under thegreat Franz Boas. In October 1936 a naked woman was found wandering in Haiti’sArtibonite Valley; her name was Felicia Felix-Mentor, and she had died at theage of twenty-nine and been buried. Zora Hurston went to visit her in thehospital at Gonaïves and described her as having “a blank face with dead eyes”and eyelids “white as if they had been burned with acid”.According to Zora Hurston, people were “zombified” if they betrayed the secretsof the Haitian secret societies. No one believed her, and Metraux writespatronizingly of “Zora Houston [sic], who is very superstitious”. Nevertheless,Metraux tells a story involving two members of “high society”. After his carbroke down, one of them was invited to the home of a little white bearded man, ahoungan or vodoun (voodoo) priest. Piqued by his guest’s skepticism about awanga (magical charm), the old man asked him if he had known a certain M.Celestin – who had, in fact, been one of the visitor’s closest friends. Summonedby a whip crack, a man shambled into the room, and to his horror the visitorrecognized his old friend Celestin, who had died six months earlier. When thezombie reached out for the visitor’s glass – obviously thirsty – the hounganstopped him from handing it over, saying that nothing could be more dangerousthan to give or take something from the hand of a dead man. The houngan told hisvisitor that Celestin had died from a spell and that the magician who had killedhim had sold him for twelve dollars.Other stories recounted by Metraux make it clear that he considers zombies to bepeople who have literally died and then been raised from the dead.Understandably, he rejects this as superstition. In fact, as we shall see, ZoraHurston was correct and Metraux was wrong.Haiti, in the West Indies, was discovered by Columbus in 1492, but it was notuntil two centuries later that it became a base for pirates and buccaneers.French colonists developed Haiti’s rich sugar trade, using black slaveskidnapped from Africa. The Spanish ceded Haiti (or Saint-Domingue, as it wascalled) to the French in 1697.The slaves were treated with unbelievable cruelty – for example, hung from treeswith nails driven through the ears or smeared with molasses and left to be eatenalive by ants. Another horrifying practice involved filling a slave’s anus withgunpowder and setting it alight, an act the Frenchmen often referred to as“blasting black’s ass”. In spite of the risks, slaves ran away whenever theycould and hid in the mountains, until, eventually, certain mountainous regionsbecame “no-go areas” for whites. In the 1740s a slave named Macandal, who hadlost his arm in a sugar press, escaped to the mountains and taught the runawayMaroons (as the slaves were known) to use poison against their oppressors. Masspoisoning of cattle was followed by mass poisoning of the colonists. Macandalwas eventually betrayed and sentenced to be burned alive (although, according tolegend, he used his magical powers to escape). But from then on, the secretsocieties spread revolt among the black slaves. After the great revolts of the1790s, French authority virtually collapsed, and although it was savagelyrestored under Napoléon, he was never able to conquer the interior of theisland. A series of black emperors ruled until 1859, but the island hasalternated between a state of virtual anarchy and harsh authoritarian rule eversince, both of which have nurtured the secret societies.Zora Hurston asserted that “zombification” was effected by means of a“quick-acting poison”. It was not until the early 1980s, however, that a youngAmerican anthropologist, Wade Davies, heard rumours that zombification was, infact, a process involving certain known poisons, chief among which was that ofthe puffer fish – a delicacy dear to the Japanese, although it has to beprepared with extreme care. (More on this follows.)Summoned to meet a New York psychiatrist named Nathan Kline, Davies was told oftwo recent cases that seemed to demonstrate beyond all doubt that zombificationwas not a myth. In 1962 a Haitian peasant in his forties, Clairvius Narcisse,was admitted to the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in the Artibonite Valley,suffering from fever; he died two days later and was buried the next day.Eighteen years later, in 1980, a man walked up to Narcisse’s sister Angelina andidentified himself as her brother, Clairvius. He asserted that he had been“zombified” by order of his brother, with whom he had been disputing about land.He had been removed from his grave and taken to work with other zombies. Aftertwo years, their master was killed and he escaped to wander the country for thenext sixteen years. It was not until he heard of his brother’s death that hedared to make himself known.Narcisse’s identity was confirmed, and the BBC made a short film about the case.In the same year, a group of “zombies” was found wandering in the north of thecountry – where Narcisse had been forced to work, confirming Narcisse’s story ofthe escape.In 1976 a thirty-year-old woman named Francina Illeus, known as “Ti Femme”, waspronounced dead. Three years later she was found alive by her mother andrecognized by a scar on her temple; her coffin was found to be full of rocks.She believed that she was poisoned on the orders of a jealous husband.In 1980 another woman, Natagette Joseph, aged sixty, was recognized as shewandered near her home village; she had “died” in 1964.When Davies went to Haiti to investigate, his attention focused on Daturastramonium, known in America as jimsonweed and in Haiti as zombie’s cucumber. Hewent to see Max Beauvoir, an expert on vodoun. He interviewed Clairvius Narcisseand confirmed his story. He also discovered that Narcisse was not simply thevictim of a vengeful brother; he had been something of a Casanova and had leftillegitimate children – whom he declined to support – all over the place. Davieslater concluded that “zombification” is not simply a matter of malice. Thesecret societies had a sinister reputation, but it seemed that they were lessblack than they were painted and often acted as protectors of the oppressed.Zombification, it seemed, was often a punishment for flagrant wrongdoing.Davies’s research led him to a highly poisonous toad, the Bufo marinus, and totwo varieties of puffer fish, so called because they inflate themselves withwater when threatened. Both are full of deadly neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin, afatal dose of which would just cover the head of a pin. Captain Cook hadsuffered severely after eating the cooked liver and roe of a puffer fish. TheJapanese throw away all the poisonous parts of the fish and eat the flesh raw –as sashimi – but the deadly liver is also eaten after being cleaned and boiled.But it was clear to Davies that the poison of the puffer fish is not the solesecret of “zombification”. In his extraordinary book The Serpent and the Rainbow(1985), he describes his search for samples of zombie poison. His aim was toobtain samples and take them back to be tested in the laboratory. But althoughhe met a number of houngans and witnessed some remarkable ceremonies – in anumber of which he saw people “possessed” by spirits (so that one woman was ableto place a lighted cigarette on her tongue without being burned) – his questcame to a premature end when one of his major backers died and another suffereda debilitating stroke. But his book leaves very little doubt that the secret of“zombification” is a poison that can produce all the signs of death. When thebody is dug up, an antidote is administered (Davies was able to study someantidotes and concluded that the “magical” powers of the priest seem to be asimportant as the ingredients themselves), and then the victim is often stupefiedby further drugs that reduce the subject to a level of virtual idiocy.A 1984 BBC programme introduced by John Tusa confirmed that “zombification”results from a poison that affects certain brain centres, reducing consciousnessto a dream level.Wade Davies was left in no doubt about the reality of “zombification”. But hisinvestigation into the vodoun religion also seems to have convinced him that notall the phenomena of vodoun can be explained in such naturalistic terms."},{"pageContent":"Index > Abdul Hamid,
