My memories of the place are not very clear: Ichiefly recall the small boy called Pedro, who lived next door and who drewpictures in the dust of the courtyard, with a stick, and a tall man in a cloakand an odd-shaped hat who walked into the house one day and showed my mother howto split a banana into three with his thumb-nail. From the fact that hepresented me with one of his books—a children’s story called The Poor Boy WhoFollowed His Star—I gathered that he was a writer like my father. Years later,when I became an avid fan of the I, Claudius series on television, I wasimpressed to realise that I knew its author.What I did not know was that my father had asked Robert Graves’s advice onwriting a book about ‘the occult’, and that that advice had been ‘don’t’. It wasas well he ignored it, for the book and its consequences became an importantpart of our lives during the next few years. It led—to begin with—to a BBCtelevision series called ‘A Leap in the Dark’, in which my father was thepresenter. We bought our first video machine to record them—the early kind whosetapes played for a maximum of one hour—and so videos became a part of our liveslong before they became as common as televisions. One result was that I was ableto watch the ‘Leap in the Dark’ series as often as I liked. The ‘creepiest’ wasthe Edgar Vandy case, in which a dead man ‘came back’ to describe his accidentaldrowning through the mouth of a medium. The point of the programme was to try toshow that only the dead man could have provided the information, and thattelepathy by the medium could not account for the complex data she was able toprovide. But the one I remember most was the case of a girl called ChristineBeauchamp, who suffered from ‘multiple personality’—she periodically turned intoa scatterbrained and mischievous child who called herself Sally, and whoembarrassed Christine by doing mischievous things that landed her in all kindsof trouble. Then there was the account of the poltergeist which wrecked theoffice of a German lawyer in Rosenheim, and which subsided only when a shy,nervous girl called Anne-Marie was sacked. I was intrigued to learn that thiswas not a real ‘ghost’, but some kind of manifestation of Anne-Marie’sunconscious frustrations.All this meant that, by the age of 10,1 had a fairly good working knowledge ofthe paranormal, which I accepted in the same matter-of-fact way that I acceptedall the books and magazines about true murder cases that lay about the house.Like any normal 10-year-old, I would not have wanted to meet a ghost; but I wasintrigued to learn that they could be explained by a science called‘parapsychology’.One day I learned that it was not quite as simple as that. A man called MikeDelaney came to stay with us, and I learned that he was a publican who had beendriven out of his pub by a poltergeist that smashed rows of bottles and glasses,and made the electronic tills go haywire—Mike was still suffering from nervousstrain. My father was writing a book about poltergeists—and had been to Croydonto look into the case. There were apparently no ‘disturbed adolescents’associated with the pub, and Mike himself had no doubt that the culprit was aspirit. I talked to Mike for hours, and noted that he preferred not to discussthe haunting—it was obvious that he was still deeply disturbed by it. In fact,he went to see our doctor, and took his advice to commit himself to our localmental home in Bodmin. (That quickly proved to him that there was nothing wrongwith him, and he discharged himself and went off to Africa to become amercenary.)My father also went to Yorkshire to look into the case of a ‘spirit’ that hadwrecked every breakable object in the house (see Appendix[../Text/22_appendix.html]). When he came back, he was finally convinced thatpoltergeists are real spirits, and not just the unconscious energies offrustrated adolescents. Obviously, it was possible to be too ‘scientific’.But another experience of the time also demonstrated that it was possible to betoo credulous. When my mother was going to Bodmin one day, my father asked herto go and look at St Mark’s Church, and see if she could find out anything abouta poltergeist haunting there. A journalist called John Macklin, well-known forhis ‘believe it or not’ stories, had described how a coffin had risen up off itstrestles and floated down the aisle. The man in the coffin, a Liskard buildercalled Pencarrow, objected to being buried near his estranged wife, and hisspirit caused poltergeist disturbances until his son decided to bury himelsewhere. There was even a bare patch on the lawn of the churchyard, wherePencarrow’s coffin had rested before being taken away—no grass had grown theresince. My mother was asked to try and get a photograph of the bare patch.In fact, she found that there was no St Mark’s Church in Bodmin, or even inCornwall. The vicar, the Rev. Basil Bradley, had never lived in Bodmin. And nobuilder called James Pencarrow had lived in Liskard either.Another story by John Macklin—about a ‘cursed’ field in North Cornwall—proved tobe equally unfactual. When my father wrote to Macklin asking for an explanation,he got an angry letter in reply protesting that no one had ever questioned hisaccuracy, but offering no other explanation. All of which seemed to demonstratethat the science of parapsychology had to tread an extremely wary path betweenscepticism and credulity.In fact, what tends to happen is that the positions become polarised; thesceptics attack the believers as gullible idiots; the believers attack thesceptics as dogmatic materialists. Both seem incapable of moderation orobjectivity. The career of the French statistician Michel Gauquelin illustratesboth positions. By the age of 7 he was a total convert to astrology, and couldrattle off the character-types associated with each sign of the zodiac; hisfriends called him Nostradamus. While studying at the Sorbonne, he learned ofthe earlier researches of ‘Hitler’s astrologer’ Karl Ernst Krafft, who had triedto ‘prove’ astrology by statistical means. Krafft had studied the horoscopes ofthousands of professional men, mostly musicians, and announced that he hadproved that individuals are cast in the mould of their ‘sun sign’ (i.e. Ariesare pioneers, Geminis changeable, Cancers home-loving, etc.) Gauquelin, who wasstudying statistics and psychology, decided to put Krafft’s results through acomputer. That convinced him—as he had suspected—that Krafft was deceivinghimself. His reaction was to become a determined opponent of astrology whomissed no opportunity to denounce it as nonsense. He even went so far as toignore the occasional fact that supported astrology. But since he was astatistician, he continued with his research. And when he looked into thequestion of ‘rising signs’ (the ‘planet’ that is coming up over the horizon atthe moment of birth) he was startled to realise that the evidence was no longernegative. In a group of 576 doctors, he discovered that a significant proportionwere born under Saturn—as astrology predicts. Similar researches into actorsshowed that Jupiter was their rising sign, while sportsmen tended to be bornunder Mars. He also investigated the notion that people born under the ‘even’signs (Taurus, Cancer, Virgo etc) are introverts while those born under the oddsigns are extraverts; again he was surprised to find that his statisticssupported this view.He announced his findings in 1955, in The Influence of the Stars—A Critical andExperimental Study. He expected to be attacked by scientists; in fact, theyignored him. It was the astrologers who assumed they were under attack, andresponded with scathing criticisms.But another sceptic, Professor Hans Eysenck, who checked Gauquelin’s results,was courageous enough to invite the derision of his fellow psychologists when hewrote: ‘The results were extremely clear-cut and so significant statisticallythat there is no question whatsoever that the effects were not produced bychance.’By 1976, Gauquelin’s findings had become increasingly influential, andparapsychology had acquired a new respectability through the researches of DrAndrija Puharich and the Stanford Research Institute into the powers of theIsraeli metal-bender Uri Geller. It had also acquired widespread popularity, sothat books like von Daniken’s Chariots of the Gods and Castaneda’s Teachings ofDon Juan became bestsellers. Orthodox scientists felt it was time to act. Theyformed a Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Claims of theParanormal (CSICOP), apparently unaware that the Society for Psychical Research(founded in 1882) had been founded for exactly that purpose.Unfortunately, CSICOP differed from the SPR in starting out from a position ofhard-line scepticism —in fact, of downright hostility to the very notion of theparanormal. Its basic position seemed to be that anyone who reported paranormalevents must be either a fool or a liar. At a meeting of the American Associationfor the Advancement of Science in 1979, the eminent physicist John Wheeler wasapplauded for his battle-cry: ‘Drive the pseudos out of the workshop ofscience.’ Oddly enough, it was the same John Wheeler who created his own versionof the ‘anthropic principle’ (the notion that man has, in some respects, a‘priveleged position’ in the universe), in which he asserted that man may becreating the universe by observing it.I was surprised to learn that one of the founders of CSICOP, the scientificjournalist Martin Gardner, had been a friend of my father’s. He is the author ofa book called Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, an amusing attack onvarious ‘crank theories’, such as the view that the earth is flat, and he and myfather had been in correspondence for some years when they finally met (atGardner’s home) and found one another sympathetic—one of my father’s sciencefiction stories has an affectionate portrait of him as a mediaeval monk calledMartin the Gardener. But when he came to write a biography of Wilhelm Reich inthe late ’70s, my father reread the chapter in Fads and Fallacies about Reichand concluded that it was biased and inaccurate. In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich,he commented on Gardner’s book: ‘He writes about various kinds of cranks withthe conscious superiority of the scientist, and in most cases one can share hissense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters, this non-stopsuperiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards thatmake him so certain he is always right.’ Gardner took this to be a declarationof war, and launched attacks on my father’s ‘credulity’ in his books Science:Good, Bad and Bogus and The New Age. He also wrote a letter to the New YorkReview of Books protesting that articles by my father (on astrology andparanormal phenomena) had been included in The Oxford Companion to the Mind. Hisgeneral tone makes it clear that he regards anyone who can defend the paranormalas a dangerous maniac.In 1981, CSICOP was shaken by rumours of scandal. One of its members, Dr DennisRawlins, discovered that a refutation of Gauquelin’s ‘Mars effect’ was based oninaccurate research; among other things, it based its findings on 303 sportschampions instead of Gauquelin’s 2,088. When the mistakes had been corrected,the report tended to confirm Gauquelin. When he pointed this out to this fellowmembers on the executive council, he found them unresponsive—they seemed to feelhe was splitting hairs—and he was not allowed to print a letter on the subjectin the CSICOP journal The Zetetic Inquirer, even though he was an associateeditor. In fact, Rawlins made his own follow-up study of the Mars effect whichconcluded that Gauquelin was wrong after all. This he was allowed to publish inthe magazine on condition that the section that revealed the truth about thefirst debunking report was edited out. He insisted that a note be printed to theeffect that part of the article had been censored, and this was agreed; but whenthe article appeared, the note had been removed.Rawlins now insisted that the dispute be judged by a team of impartial referees.The council agreed, but insisted that they should choose the referees. When, infact, the referees agreed with Rawlins that the first report had been based onfaulty data, the council declined to print the referees’ report. In 1979 Rawlinstried to speak out at a CSICOP press conference; the council stopped theconference before he could finish, and then met in closed session and voted himoff the executive. When the Zetetic Inquirer continued to refuse to publish thecorrection (in spite of the fact that Rawlins remained an associate editor), hefinally resigned, and told the whole story in a pamphlet called STARBABY. Itscover states: ‘They call themselves the Committee for the Investigation ofClaims of the Paranormal. In fact they are a group of would-be debunkers whobungled their major investigation, falsified the results, covered up theirerrors, and gave the boot to a colleague who threatened to tell the truth.’ In1980, Marcello Truzzi, founder and editor of the Zetetic Inquirer (and an oldfriend of my father), resigned when the council refused to agree that if youprint an attack on someone, it is only fair to print their reply.CSICOP was embarrassed but unrepentant; they obviously felt that, in spite oftheir misdeeds, they were right to take an uncompromising stand against the‘black tide of occultism’ (Freud’s phrase). Since then, CSICOP has expanded, andnow has branches all over the world.My own attitude to the dispute is obviously influenced by the fact that I am aninterested party. But when I recently read large parts of Gardner’s The New Age:Notes of a Fringe Watcher, I think my reaction had little to do with itssideswipes at my father. It was a feeling of sadness that a mind as brilliant asGardner’s (and I still reread his Fads and Fallacies with pleasure) shouldremain so relentlessly negative. There is a passage in Shaw’s Man and Supermanwhere the president of the brigands insists on reading aloud verses ofsentimental poetry about a girl who jilted him. The hero slaps him on theshoulder and says: ‘Put them in the fire, president. You are sacrificing yourcareer to a monomania.’ The president replies sadly: ‘I know it.’ Mr Gardnerdoes not know it. He is like a man who wants to tell you his grievances atlength, unaware that you do not find them as fascinating as he does.What seems so odd is that a committee for the investigation of claims of theparanormal does so little actual investigating. It seems to prefer appeals to‘reason’ that are actually restatements of its basic prejudice—that paranormalphenomena do not and cannot exist. It seems that no one in this organisation ofscientists can recognise the purely logical objection to the ‘debunking’ method,the objection that William James stated in a single sentence: ‘If you wish toupset the law that all crows are black, you must not seek to show that no crowsare; it is enough if you prove one single crow to be white.’ In other words, itwould not make the slightest difference if 99% of claims of the paranormal wereexploded, if just 1% stood up to the most rigorous investigation.This book is full of flocks of white crows. But since my father has omitted it,perhaps I can offer my own favourite example—the odd story of Frederick BlighBond and the excavations at Glastonbury Abbey.In 1907 the Church of England bought Glastonbury Abbey—which had been destroyedby Henry VIII—for £36,000, and chose Bond, who was an architect, to excavate theruins. What the Church did not know was that Bond was keenly interested inSpiritualism and telepathy.There was one minor problem—there was no money to organise a full-scale dig. SoBond decided to try a short cut. He asked a psychic friend, John Allen Bartlett,to try ‘automatic writing’. On the afternoon of November 7, 1907, Bartlett andBond sat facing one another, Bartlett holding a pencil and Bond resting his handgently on it. Bond asked: ‘Can you tell us anything about Glastonbury?’, and thepencil wrote: ‘All knowledge is eternal and open to mental sympathy. I was notin sympathy with the monks—I cannot find a monk yet.’ This, it seemed, must beBartlett’s ‘guide’. Bond suggested that he knew a few living monks who mightform a sympathetic link. Soon after, the pencil traced an outline that theyrecognised as the abbey, but with a long rectangle —which they did notrecognise—stuck on its eastern end. The sketch was signed ‘GulielmusMonachus’—William the Monk. And when Bond asked for more details, he obligedwith a more precise sketch of the rectangle—which was obviously a chapel—andadded two smaller rectangles—probably towers—to the north. Another monk whocalled himself Johannes Bryant the Lapidator (stonemason) added more details.Other monks, including the Abbot Bere, Ambrosius the Cellarer and PeterLightfoot the Clockmaker provided more information in Latin and Old English.By the time the money was finally available to start excavations—in 1908—Bondhad accumulated remarkably detailed information about the abbey from his ghostlyinformants. In May 1909 the workmen began to dig trenches along the linesindicated by William the Monk. Bond’s rival Caroe came to look, and must havebeen mystified by their apparently random arrangement. A few days later, Bondproved he knew exactly what he was doing when the digging revealed an immenseand unsuspected wall running north and south for 31 feet—the east chapel.Digging at the other end revealed two towers. From then on, discovery followeddiscovery. The monks told Bond of a door in the east wall leading into thestreet; this sounded unlikely, because east doorways are rare it proved to beexactly where they said it was. Bond was slightly sceptical when they told himthat the chapel was 90 feet long—that seemed too big; but it proved to be 87feet, and the wall and plinth added the extra three feet. They even told himthat he would find the remains of azure-coloured windows, although most of thestained glass of that period was white and gold; but the azure glass was dulyfound. When a skeleton was uncovered, with its damaged skull between its legs,the monks explained that it was one Radulphus Cancellarius, Radulphus theTreasurer, who had slain in fair fight an earl called Eawulf of Edgarley. No onehad ever heard of an earldom in Edgarley (a nearby village), but ancient recordsunearthed a nobleman called Eanwulf of Somerton, very close to Edgarley. . .After nine years of non-stop success, Bond decided that it would now be safe totell the true story of the ‘Company of Avalon’ (as the monks called themselves).In 1918, he did so in a book called The Gate of Remembrance. The effect wasinstantaneous and disastrous. Budgets were cut; Bond was obstructed by red tape,and in 1922 was dismissed. He lived on, a lonely and embittered man, for anotherquarter of a century. While the abbey became a tourist attraction that broughtthe Church a satisfactory return for its investment, Bond’s book was not evensold in the abbey bookshop.Oddly enough, Bond himself did not believe that his information came from deadmonks; he thought it probably originated in the ‘racial unconscious’. That madeno difference; the Church of England was not only opposed to Spiritualism, butto anything that sounded ‘supernatural’. Fourteen years after Bond’s dismissal,Archbishop Cosmo Lang recognised the absurdity of this position, and appointed acommittee to look into the claims of Spiritualism. The committee sat for threeyears, and finally concluded that the claims of Spiritualism were probably true,and that, in any case, there is nothing in the idea of communication with thedead that contradicts Christian doctrine. Embarrassed by this report, the Churchdecided to drop it into a drawer, where it remained for another forty years,until its publication in 1979.The problem remains: why is it that CSICOP and the Church of England can bothtake up the same uncompromising position on the paranormal? On one level, theanswer is obvious. Coping with this complex material world requires adown-to-earth attitude, and the most successful copers will be the down-to-earthmaterialists. We all want to be successful copers, therefore we are all inclinedto be impatient with anyone who seems to live in a world of ideals andabstractions. We all agree that ideals and abstractions are important for theprogress of humanity; but we would like to keep them at bay until they haveproved their worth. Shaw’s Andrew Undershaft remarks: ‘That is what is wrongwith the world at present. It scraps its obsolete steam engines and dynamos; butit won’t scrap its old prejudices and its old moralities and its old religionsand its old political constitutions. What’s the result? In machinery it doesvery well; but in morals and religion and politics it is working at a loss thatbrings it nearer bankrupcy every year.’In 1962, Thomas S. Kuhn’s book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions set outto investigate this reluctance to scrap old prejudices. He points out that whenscientists have accepted a theory as satisfactory, they are deeply unwilling toadmit that there might be anything wrong with it. They ignore smallcontradictions, but get furious if the contradictory facts grow larger. They areunaware that there is anything wrong about this reaction; they feel that it isthe natural attitude of a reasonable man in the face of time-wastingabsurdities. New ‘paradigms’ are always seen as time-wasting absurdities.All this is as natural as the urge to self- preservation; in fact, it is a partof the urge to self-preservation. William James made the same point in an essaycalled ‘On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings’. Cart-horses used to beblinkered to stop them from shying in the traffic; human beings need blinkers tokeep them relaxed and sane. Kuhn tells a story of an experiment using playingcards, in which some of the cards were deliberate ‘freaks’—black hearts and redspades. Subjects were asked to call out the suits as the cards were shown tothem. When the ‘freak’ card was shown only for a moment, nobody noticed anythingwrong. But if the exposure was slightly longer, they became puzzled and upset;they knew there was something wrong, but didn’t know what it was. Some suffered‘acute personal distress’. When they fathomed what was wrong, the distress wasreplaced by relief. But a few failed to spot the deliberate mistake, andsuffered an increasing build-up of anxiety. According to Kuhn, the demand tointroduce new factors into our belief systems causes the same distress andanxiety—and encounters the same resistance.What we are talking about, of course, is preconceptions. What is apreconception? It is a kind of mental map that enables you to find your wayaround, and saves you a great deal of trouble and anxiety—and no anxiety isworse than the anxiety of not knowing where you are and where you are going.Once we have gone to the trouble of acquiring a map, we are naturally anxiousnot to have to alter it. Small changes are not too difficult to accept. Butlarge changes produce a sensation like the ground quaking under your feet.The psychologist Abraham Maslow described an experiment that takes this argumenta stage further. The subjects this time were baby pigs. The most timid pigswanted to stay close to their mother in the sty. More enterprising ones exploredthe sty, and, if the door was left open, went outside. If the door was thenclosed, they squealed pitifully until let in. Next time the door was left open,they hesitated about venturing out. Then curiosity overcame them, and theydecided to take the risk. These ‘explorers’ were, in fact, the most dominant andhealthy among the piglets.I shall not press the comparison too far, since the members of CSICOP may beoffended at being compared to non-dominant piglets. Besides, some of the mostobstructive conservatives in the history of science have been highly dominant. Isimply want to plead my point that CSICOP is not furthering the progress ofscience by shouting abuse at scientists who are engaged in paranormal researchand demanding that they be driven out of the workshop of science (which meanssuspending their grants). By trying to repress research into the paranormal theyare striking at the very essence of science. And in telling the rest of us tostop thinking about the frontiers of science and leave it to the professionals(i.e themselves), they are ignoring the fact that anyone who applies hisintelligence to the solution of a problem is, by definition, a scientist. Andthat includes all the readers of this book.I am not trying to argue that we should drop all standards, and give seriousconsideration to every crank theory. But when I look at the number of fairlywell-authenticated white crows in the field of paranormal research—telepathy,dowsing, psychometry, precognition—the attitude of CSICOP seems akin to Nelsonclapping his telescope to his blind eye and declaring that he could see nothing.In a chapter of The New Age entitled ‘PK (Psycho-Krap)’, Martin Gardner remarksthat ‘most professional parapsychologists will be embarrassed by . . . thescribblings of such irresponsible journalists of the occult as Colin Wilson,Lyall Watson and D. Scott Rogo’. Whether my father’s work on the paranormalamounts to embarrassing scribbling I leave to the reader to decide; you areundoubtedly less biased than I am."},{"pageContent":"ContentsForeword by Damon Wilson [../Text/03_foreword.html]Preface [../Text/05_preface.html]1 The Rebirth of Magic [../Text/06_chapter01.html]Publication of The Morning of the Magicians.

But then, I was 15 in 1946, and H. G. Wellswas still alive, and Wells had been the single greatest influence on my ideasand my life.This was understandable. Wells, like me, came from a working-class background —his parents kept a not-very-successful shop in Kent, which soon went bankrupt.Thereafter, his mother, who was the driving force in the family, made an attemptto get him apprenticed to a draper’s shop, but he hated it as much as CharlesDickens had hated the blacking factory to which he had been condemned as ateenager. Wells ran away several times, until his mother got the much betteridea of making him a schoolteacher.For me at 15, born in the industrial town of Leicester, there seemed no chanceof the blacking factory or its equivalent, for the Victorian age lay far behindus, and my academic record had been excellent: I won a scholarship to asecondary school as easily as a good racehorse takes a ditch. Had my income notbeen needed at home to help support the family, I would have gone to university,got a science degree and gone on from there.But I can still remember my sadness when Wells died in August of that year atthe age of 80. That month was also a turning point in my own life, for it wasthen that I left school at the age of 16, and the Labour Exchange sent me to awool factory, where hanks of wool were wound on to bobbins before being used inhosiery factories (Leicester’s other main industry after the shoe trade). Iworked from 8 am until 6 pm (plus Saturday mornings) with a half hour break forlunch, and it was the hardest work I had ever done. It was a man’s job, heavingaround great crates of wool, and I hated it as furiously as Dickens had hatedthe blacking factory or Wells the drapery emporium.Then rescue arrived. My old school offered me a job as a laboratory assistant,with the prospect of going on to take a science degree. It should have been thesolution to all my problems. But there was a completely unforeseen obstacle: inthose grim months of factory work, I had been so plunged into depression anddesperation that I had lost interest in science. Fortunately, however, a newenthusiasm had replaced it. . .A year or so earlier, I had come upon a little book called Palgrave’s GoldenTreasury, an anthology of poetry from Spenser to the late Victorians, and Irealised I enjoyed poetry. And now poetry became the answer to the boredom ofthe factory. Every evening when I got home I retired to my bedroom and plungedinto poetry as into a warm bath. By now I had a shelf full of books, from Miltonto Eliot. I planned my reading as I might have planned the itinerary of aholiday. I usually began with poetry that reflected my pessimism: Poe’s Raven orUlalume, Thompson’s City of Dreadful Night, Eliot’s Hollow Men and Waste Land;then, as I began to feel better, Keats’ Ode to a Nightingale, Shelley’s Adonais,Coleridge’s Dejection, Fitzgerald’s Rubaiyat; and might well end with Milton’sL’Allegro or even Lewis Carroll’s Walrus and the Carpenter. And by that time Ihad returned to my usual buoyant optimism.All this taught me something extremely interesting: that I could steer myselfinto different states of mind, and could choose how I felt. Or, as EdmundHusserl, a philosopher I later came to admire, would put it, feelings areintentional. So although my loss of interest in science was something of adisaster, I soon began to feel I had replaced it with a world just asfascinating: the vast universe of art and literature and philosophy.In fact, the most widely discussed philosophy of that period (1947–50) wasExistentialism, which was, quite simply, an attempt to bring philosophy down toearth. Oddly enough, it was summarised in the title of a book Wells had writtenin 1935: What Are We to do with Our Lives? This began with the recognition thatthe world is changing so fast that we have to try and grasp it, and take chargeof it instead of merely enduring it. What had happened in the past, Wells said,was that man had been repressed and limited by institutions like the Church andthe ruling classes. Now he could choose what he wanted to be.To me, growing up at the end of World War Two, it was not purely a socialquestion. Dostoevsky, for example, said that if the human race was quite certainof the existence of life after death, this would be by far the most importantknowledge we could have. Which is why, from a fairly early stage in my life, Ihad been preoccupied with such questions. Who was I? What was I doing here? Andnow that it seemed that science had failed to provide an answer, I knew I had tobegin all over again.After my earlier success as an author with The Outsider, it was pure chance thatstarted me on my new beginning as a writer of the occult: the publication in themid-1960s of a book called The Morning of the Magicians (The Dawn of Magic inthe UK), which was willing to ask all the questions over again. It was immenselysuccessful, and started an ‘occult boom’ all over the world. In 1968, myAmerican agent asked me if I would be willing to write a book on the occult. Itwas not a subject that deeply interested me, but I knew the advance would beuseful.I began researching it on a trip to Majorca in 1969, where I met the poet RobertGraves, whose book The White Goddess was the perfect preparation for such awork. The result was The Occult, whose success delighted and astonished me. Thiswas followed by two sequels, Mysteries and Beyond the Occult, all three volumesamounting to over two million words. Finally, in 1991, my son Damon set out tocompress the essence of the three volumes into the work you at present havebefore you."},{"pageContent":"1The Rebirth of MagicIN PARIS in the year 1960 there appeared on the bookstalls a volume with theeuphonious title Le Matin des Magicians (The Morning of the Magicians). Theauthors were an oddly assorted pair—a flamboyant journalist named Louis Pauwels,and Jacques Bergier, an atomic physicist who was also a practising alchemist. Itis a curious hodgepodge of a book, as the authors themselves recognised, forthey wrote in the first chapter: ‘Skip chapters if you want to; begin where youlike, and read in any direction; this book is a multiple-use tool, like theknives campers use . . .’ To everyone’s astonishment, it became a best-seller,running through edition after edition in France. Serious critics were irritatedand baffled by its success; they pointed out that the book was merely a seriesof wild speculations on magic, alchemy, telepathy, prophecy, strange cults, theGreat Pyramid, Hitler’s astrologers, the Cabala, flying saucers, and a thousandother topics. This mass of eccentricity was held together by one simple theme:that the world is a stranger and richer place than science is willing torecognise.It was a message that apparently had a wide appeal in France, especially to theyoung. They were less interested in the book’s argument about the narrowness ofscience than in the imaginative appeal of its magical wonders. Other writers sawthat there was money to be made out of the occult, and as books on astrology,reincarnation and visitors from outer space rolled off the presses there was nosign of any loss of interest. The craze spread to the United States, Britain,Spain, Italy, Germany, France and South America. In 1968, a German book calledMemories of the Future made a fortune and a reputation for its author Erich vonDaniken, and sold more copies than any other book except the Bible. Daniken’sthesis was that the earth was visited thousands of years ago by spacemen, wholeft behind signs of their presence such as the statues of Easter Island and thepyramids. Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001, A Space Odyssey, was based on the sameidea. It became a kind of cult, and its admirers went to see it again and again,just as they might attend a religious ceremony. The great occult boom hadarrived.I had bought The Morning of the Magicians when it appeared in England in 1963(under the title The Dawn of Magic), but although I enjoyed it, had not taken ittoo seriously; it struck me as a little too wild and undisciplined. Besides, itwas full of errors. It talked, for example, about the remarkable maps which, itdeclared, had been presented to the Library of Congress in the mid-19th centuryby a Turkish naval officer called Piri Reis, the oldest of which dates from the1st century AD, yet which shows Antarctica, which was not discovered until1818—and which, moreover, seems to show its shape as it was before it wascovered with ice. Another map shows a land bridge across the Bering Strait,between Siberia and Alaska, which has not existed for at least 12,000 years. Allthis seems to argue that civilisation is far older than we realise—or possiblythat the world was visited in the remote past by aliens from other planets.The authors were right about the maps, but they had spoiled an interesting andexciting argument by being wrong about Piri Reis, who was actually a Greekpirate who was beheaded in 1554. And although I was not aware of this particularerror when I first read the book, I sensed a general atmosphere of carelessnessthat I found irritating. This is why I felt no temptation to join in the ‘OccultRevival’ that seemed to be going on all around me.Not that I was indifferent to the subject of the ‘supernatural’—otherwise Iwould not have bought the book in the first place. When I was about 10 yearsold, I had been deeply impressed by a series of articles in a Sunday newspaperthat purported to be the after-death experiences of an airman who had died inthe Battle of Britain, as received through a ‘spirit medium’. He described whatit was like to die in considerable detail, and how the ‘next world’ was amarvellous place with emerald-green grass and perpetually flowering trees—Iremember being particularly impressed by his account of going to swim in waterthat was like warm cotton wool, and didn’t get up your nose. I hurried to thelocal library, and located various books on Spiritualism, including HarryPrice’s Most Haunted House in England, an account of the haunting of Borleyrectory (see pp. 233 [../Text/13_chapter08.html#page_233]ff). This so impressedme that I read my way right through every book they had on ghosts, poltergeistsand life after death. For the next month or so I kept my schoolfriends in astate of astonishment with weird tales of the occult.My enthusiasm soon waned when an uncle presented me with a book called TheMarvels and Mysteries of Science, and my mother bought me a chemistry set forChristmas. Science filled me with an ecstatic excitement that was as magical asany fairy tale, and the fascination with ‘the occult’ seemed to vanish like adream at cockcrow. Yet it revived in flashes over the years: for example, when,at the age of 20, I was living in London, and came upon a strange work calledthe I Ching in the local library—newly translated by Jung’s friend RichardWilhelm. Like everybody else who has ever acquired the I Ching, I immediatelyconsulted the oracle on my own future, and was gratified when the result was thefirst hexagram in the book: Ch’ien, The Creative, with a judgement:‘The creative works supreme success,Furthering through perseverance.’This led me on to a study of ritual magic and witchcraft, as well as to the workof Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. I was particularly struck by a passage in theintroduction to Ouspensky’s New Model of the Universe:‘It is the year 1906 or 1907. The editorial office of the Moscow daily paper TheMorning. I have just received the foreign papers and I have to write an articleon the forthcoming Hague Conference. French, German, English, Italian papers.Phrases, phrases, sympathetic, critical, ironical, blatant, pompous, lying and,worst of all, utterly automatic phrases which have been used a thousand timesand will be used again on entirely different, perhaps contradictory, occasions.I have to make a survey of all these words and opinions, pretending to take themseriously, and then, just as seriously, to write something on my own account.But what can I say? It is all so tedious. Diplomats and all kinds of statesmenwill gather together and talk, papers will approve or disapprove, sympathise ornot sympathise. Then everything will be as it was, or even worse.‘It is still early, I say to myself; perhaps something will come into my headlater.‘Pushing aside the papers, I open a drawer in my desk. The whole desk is crammedwith books with strange titles, The Occult World, Life After Death, Atlantis andLemuria, Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie, Le Temple de Satan, The SincereNarrations of a Pilgrim, and the like. These books and I have been inseparablefor a whole month, and the world of the Hague Conference and leading articlesbecomes more and more vague and unreal to me.‘I open one of the books at random, feeling that my article will not be writtentoday. Well, it can go to the devil. Humanity will lose nothing if there is onearticle less on the Hague Conference.’All this was a faithful reflection of my own state of mind at the time. At theage of 20 I was already a father, and was living in South Wimbledon, in the homeof an old invalid who had hired my wife as a nurse. Since my marriage I had madea living by working in a series of plastics factories. It was hard to findlandladies who would put up with babies, and we had moved four times in thecourse of one year. Within a few months our present landlord would die, and mywife would take on a job as the nurse of a half-insane virago who lived in EarlsCourt; she would prove to be our worst trial so far, and she exhausted us bothso much that when we separated—to try and find yet another home—we concludedthat we were sick of marriage, and drifted apart.During the next three years I worked at a series of temporary jobs—in offices,factories, coffee bars—and tried to write a novel about an ‘outsider’ who feelsas Ouspensky did about modern civilisation. I had always been fascinated byrebels and ‘outsiders’, social misfits who loathe what the philosopher Heideggercalled ‘the triviality of everydayness’. And it was while working as adishwasher in a London coffee bar in the mid-1950s that I decided to lay asidethe novel and try to express my frustrations in a more straightforward manner bywriting a book about ‘outsiders’.It proved to be a good decision. The Outsider happened to be accepted by thefirst publisher to whom I sent a dozen or so pages, and, when it appeared in1956, became an immediate bestseller. This was partly because it was a book thathad something new to say—I am neither stupid nor modest enough to regard itssuccess as a fluke. But it was also because the English literary scene had beensingularly devoid of new talent since the end of the war. And the journalistswho wrote about me made much of my publisher’s admission that I was only 24, andthat I had written it in the Reading Room of the British Museum, while sleepingduring the nights on Hampstead Heath to save rent.The result, at all events, was an explosion of international notoriety and moremoney than I had ever dreamed of. But fame, I soon discovered, also had itsnegative side. The British are not—to put it mildly—a nation of intellectuals.Unlike the French, the Germans—even the Americans—they take no interest in theworld of ideas. They were impressed by The Outsider because it had been writtenby a 24-year-old who had not been to a university. But they were not really inthe least interested in romantic rebels with foreign names like Novalis,Nietzsche, Dostoevsky and Ouspensky. Moreover, it soon became clear that thepopular press resented the publicity for which they themselves were responsible,and which had helped to make the book such a success. In the following year,1957, they seized the first opportunity to announce their complete loss ofinterest in the whole Outsider phenomenon. This happened to be after thepublication of my second book, Religion and the Rebel, which was hatcheted. TheAmericans, always delighted to see a success-bubble explode, followed suit.(Time ran a headline ‘Scrambled Egghead’.)I found it a traumatic experience. But at least I was infinitely better off thanwhen I was working for £5 a week in a plastic factory or coffee bar. Ever sinceI had been a small boy, I had dreamed of living in a tub, like Diogenes, or insome tiny room under the earth, rather like one of Tolkien’s Hobbit holes—awarm, comfortable retreat stocked with food and books. I didn’t really much carefor being ‘famous’ and going to literary parties; mixing too much with peoplebewildered me and gave me a sensation I called ‘people-poisoning’. I wanted tobe allowed to spend my days reading and thinking. So, together with mygirlfriend Joy—whom I had met soon after my marriage broke up—I moved to aremote area of Cornwall, into an old cottage that was a fairly good imitation ofa Hobbit hole, and went back with relief to reading, writing and thinking aboutthe ideas that interested me so much.What were these ideas? Well, to begin with, I had a deep conviction that man ison the point of an evolutionary breakthrough to a higher stage. These strangeecstasies that filled the romantics with an odd sense of power and certaintywere not illusions: they were, in fact, glimpses of the unknown powers of thehuman mind. H.G. Wells once remarked that the world has changed more in the pastsixty years than in the previous 60 centuries. He meant, of course, intechnology. Yet it seemed to me that man himself has also changed more in thepast 2 centuries than in the whole of his previous evolution, and that he is nowclose to the stage at which a new creature will emerge like a butterfly from achrysalis.The Morning of the Magicians had also talked about a ‘new kind of man’, and thepossibility that human beings may be about to achieve an ‘awakened state’. Theauthors had even made the important comment that what is now needed is anEinstein of psychology who can understand the hidden powers of the mind. Yet itwas hard to see how these important ideas connected up with their talk about theHollow Earth, vanished civilisations and aliens from outer space. Which is why Icontinued to feel that the ‘occult revival’ was something I could safely ignore.Yet on lecture tours of America—which I made at intervals in an effort to keepmy bank-manager happy—I frequently bought paperbacks with titles like FamousAmerican Hauntings or Exorcism—Fact not Fiction to read on the plane. And, likeOuspensky, I continued to find something oddly fascinating in this strange ifoccasionally lunatic world of speculation.It was in 1969 that my American literary agent wrote to ask me if I would beinterested in writing a book about ‘the occult’. I accepted because I needed themoney; besides, I felt I probably knew as much about it as anybody. But I foundit hard to take the commission seriously—I only had to re-read that passage inOuspensky about Atlantis and Lemuria and The Temple of Satan to feel that I wasgoing to have to write it with my tongue firmly wedged in my cheek. Thatwinter—1969—I took the family to a small village in Majorca, where I wassupposed to be a ‘visiting professor’ in the extramural department of anAmerican college. There I met the writer Robert Graves, whose book The WhiteGoddess had given me severe headaches many years before, and I asked his adviceon writing a book about the occult. He gave it in one word: ‘Don’t.’ And I haveto admit that, if I had not already received half the advance, I would probablyhave taken his advice.It is difficult to say at which point I began to change my mind, I think it wasthe day Joy read aloud to me a passage from Osbert Sitwell’s autobiography LeftHand, Right Hand, in which he tells a story of how, just before the First WorldWar, he and a group of brother officers went to see a famous palmist ‘as alark’. What happened dismayed him. The palmist kept looking at hand after handand saying: ‘I don’t understand it. I can see nothing. . .’ The explanation camea few months later when the war broke out, and the men whose palms had been‘blank’ were killed . . .Now it seems clear from Sitwell’s other works that he was not a ‘believer’ inthe supernatural—in that respect he seems to have shared the attitude of hisfather, Sir George Sitwell, who once grabbed a ‘spirit’ that was walking aroundat a seance, and revealed it to be the medium in her underwear. And the more Istudied this subject of the paranormal, the more I discovered that some of themost convincing witnesses were not spiritualists or occultists, but unbelieverswho had had just one odd experience.Charles Dickens is another example. In a letter of May 30, 1863, he decribeshow, the previous Thursday, he had had a dream in which he saw a lady in red,who stood with her back towards him. He thought he recognised her as someone heknew, but when she turned round, saw that she was, in fact, a stranger. The ladyremarked ‘I am Miss Napier’. And as he was dressing that morning, he thought:‘What a preposterous thing to have such a distinct dream about nothing. And whyMiss Napier?’That same evening Dickens gave one of his famous public readings, and somefriends walked into his dressing-room with the lady in red, who was introducedto him as Miss Napier . . .This story raises perhaps the most difficult of all questions about the‘supernatural’. It should be totally impossible to know about an event before ittakes place, except as some kind of vague guess. Time is a one-way street, andthe future has not yet happened. We may choose to believe in all kinds ofstrange things: spontaneous combustion, telepathy, out-of-the-body experiences,haunted houses, phantom hitch hikers . . . But each one of these might well havesome more-or-less rational explanation. In the case of foreseeing an event thathas not yet happened, there is no ‘rational’ explanation: it seems to defy thelaws of reason. Yet, as I was soon to discover, there are hundreds ofwell-authenticated cases of people who have foreseen the future.What fascinated me was that this was not really so remote from my interest in‘outsiders’. Because what these cases seemed to prove beyond all doubt was thathuman beings possess strange powers of which they are normally unaware. And thisis precisely the intuition that had excited so many of the great poets andmusicians of the 19th century. In The Prelude, for example, Wordsworth decribeshow, one moonlit evening, he borrowed a small boat he found moored on the edgeof Lake Windermere, and how, as he rowed out into the middle of the lake, a hugeblack peak seemed to tower above him like a living creature. For daysafterwards, he says: and his dreams were troubled by ‘huge and mighty forms thatdo not live’.‘. . . . my brainWorked with a dim and undetermined senseOf unknown modes of being’,Is that mere ‘poetic imagination’? Or had he actually seen something that therest of us do not see because our senses are too narrow and practical, in thesame way that some people can see ghosts?Here is an example that brings home the point even more clearly. Richard Churchwas a poet who was born in London in 1893, the son of a post office worker. Lifewas hard; his mother, whom he adored, destroyed her health by working as aschoolteacher to help support the family. Church himself suffered from such poorhealth that at one point he was sent away to spend some months in a convalescenthome. He felt miserable and sick with longing for his mother. And then therecame a strange experience that, in some ways, transformed the rest of his life.He describes how:‘. . . one heavy morning, when the outside world was iron-bound with frost, Istood at a long French window in the playroom waiting to go down to breakfast.The sun was just risen beyond the ground, and stood above the lawns, his greatred disk etched with naked twigs of the bushes. Under these bushes a gardenerwas chopping down a dead tree. I watched him. The axe flashed red, and fell. Itrose again. The movement, steady and sure, fascinated me. Suddenly I realisedthat the sound of the blows did not synchronise with what I saw. The thud camewhen the axe was on an upstroke, ready for the next blow.‘I disbelieved the evidence of my eyes. Then I thought my spectacles (thosemiracle workers) must have betrayed me; or that my illness had begun to affectmy vision. I stared intently, screwing up the eye-muscles against any possibleintrusion of light or irrelevant image. But the picture I saw and the sound Iheard remained disparate.‘Then, while I stared, knowledge came to me; the knowledge that follows arecognition of fact, of concrete experience, bringing with it a widening both ofthe universe and of the individual’s understanding of it. These moments arerare, and they are wholly vital. For a flash, the recogniser is a god, who cansay ‘I am’, as Jehovah said in the Old Testament.‘On that frosty winter morning, between getting up and going down to breakfast,in an antiseptic, varnished institution where the inmates and staff were sodehumanised that they were little more than parts of the mechanism of the place,leaving me in a murmurous solitude, day after day bemused and lonely, elated bythe very dreariness of things, there I stood transfigured . . .‘I had found that time and space are not absolute. Their power was not law. Theywere not even unanimous; they quarrelled with each other; and through theirschism the human imagination, the hope, the faith, could slip, to furtherexploration where intuition had formerly hinted, but where logic and fatalcommon sense had denied.‘I felt both power and exultation flooding my veins. The blood glowed warmwithin me, rising to my brain and pulsing there, like a crowd roaring someracial acclamation. I had found out the cheat of time and space; and if thatwere so, then other seemingly stable laws of nature might be questioned, to theadvantage of this fettered and hoodwinked spirit, this hidden and oppressedself, locked in the dungeon of my body.‘I looked again, and still the evidence wrote itself upon the frosty air,against the disk of the sun who had now risen an inch or two higher, like theminute-hand of a giant clock, jerking itself up toward the hour, invisiblyvisible in its motion. The beauty of this syncopation between sight and soundreleased me from so much, from the mass of daily life, the burden of the fleshand its strict locality, from the drag of earth.‘That last was my most hated foe. The drag of earth, the weight that would pullme day and night, making every movement, even the smooth gestures which we throwin sleep, a labour too heavy to be borne; the putting on of clothes, the passagefrom chair to chair, the endless travel from one room to another, and that finaltorture, the treadmill of the tandem, during those Sunday rides behind mybrother, as I tried to do my share of the pedalling, under the goad of histongue, lashing me to it.‘But now I was free. Since time and space were deceivers, openly contradictingeach other, and at best offering a compromise in place of a law, I was atliberty to doubt further, to carry on my exploration of the horizons of freedom.Still conscious of the warm blood whispering in my veins, I looked down at mywrist and saw the transparent flesh, the bird-bones, the channels of bluebeneath the skin. All this was substance as fragile as a plant. It could notpossibly outweigh the solid earth under my feet, where I and the rest of dupedmankind walked with such docility.‘The sun had brightened to a liquid fire that dazzled my sight, reducing thewoodman and his brief moment of revelation to a penumbral figure under theshadow of the bushes in the dead grey frost. I stared at the light, and thestuff of life within my body began to increase its speed of flow. I sensed, witha benignancy deeper and more assured than reason, that my limbs and trunk werelighter than they seemed, and that I had only to reduce them by an act of will,perhaps by a mere change of physical mechanics, to command them off the ground;out of the tyranny of gravitation.‘I exerted that will, visualising my hands and feet pressing downwards upon thecentre of the earth. It was no surprise to me that I left the ground, and glidedabout the room (which was empty) some twelve or eighteen inches above theparquet floor. At first I was afraid of collapsing, of tumbling and hurtingmyself. But I had only to draw in a deep breath, and to command the air throughthe heavy portions of my anatomy, watching it flow and dilute the solid bone andflesh through the helpful chemistry of the blood, this new, released andknowledgeable blood, and I soared higher, half-way to the ceiling. Thisthoroughly frightened me, and I allowed myself to subside, coming to ground witha gentleness that was itself a sensuous delight.‘I could not leave the matter there. I must put my discovery to the test again,and accordingly I drew in a deep breath and was just about to visualise thatdownward pressure of will upon body, when the door opened, and a nurse came in.‘“Why, little boy?” she said. “Haven’t you heard the breakfast bell?”‘Then she took a second glance at me, stooped and peered into my face, “Isanything wrong? Are you feeling poorly this morning?”‘I was almost indignant, and disclaimed the suggestion that I might have atemperature, for that would mean going to bed in the large ward where a pailstood conspicuously in the middle, on a sheet of mackintosh; an improvisationwhich disgusted me.‘I hurried away without replying, leaving the nurse looking after me with someinquiry in her manner. The corridor and staircase were empty, for everybody wasat breakfast in the vast dining-room below. Here was another opportunity! I drewmy breath again, I scorned the liars of time and space, I took the presence ofChrist into my hollow, featherweight bones, and I floated down the staircasewithout touching either tread or baluster. Alighting outside the dining-roomdoor, I entered and took my seat, content now to live incognito amongst thesewingless mortals.’This is surely one of the most remarkable passages ever written by a poet. Hisother references to the experience—in his autobiography Over the Bridge—make itclear that he is telling of something that actually happened; this is not somechildish fantasy or daydream. Did he actually float through the air in aphysical sense, as he seems to be claiming? Or was he having what is known as an‘out-of-the-body experience’? His account seems to make it quite clear that itwas his physical body that floated clear of the ground. And his case is far fromunique. Dozens of children have been quite convinced that they have floateddownstairs without touching the stairs. In her book The Decline and Fall ofScience, the researcher Celia Green quotes a letter from a woman who claims tohave had the experience as a 17-year-old schoolgirl:‘Each girl took her turn lying on a long wooden table . . . with the othersgathered tightly around her, so that there were no gaps . . . As one lay there,the girls chanted a rhyme—the actual words of which I have forgotten, but whichreferred to the person on the table as looking white, ill and then dead. It wasspoken quite slowly and in unison so that its drone-like tone had great depthand was very penetrating.‘Several girls took part before me without much success . . . Some . . . didadmit to feeling a strange sensation . . . and it was this plus the declarationof a friend that encouraged me to try it.‘I have absolutely no explanation why I was able to rise approximately threefeet from the table surface. I was perfectly conscious that I was rising andmight even have uttered an exclamation of surprise . . . The rapidity of therise and indeed the fact that I had risen at all caused me to jerk my body outof the lying position, and with much commotion the girls cushioned my fall.’I, on the other hand, do have a kind of explanation of what happened. It isquite clear that a sceptic would claim that it was all auto-suggestion: the lowchanting, the suggestion that the person was becoming pale, then dead, wouldinduce a certain mood like hypnosis. And, the sceptic would assert, this thenproduced the illusion of floating up into the air. My own explanation is thatthe ‘mood’ simply triggered some unknown power that we all possess, just asRichard Church’s mood of exultation somehow showed him how to float off theground. And if this sounds absurd, then consider the well-authenticated case ofJoseph of Copertino, the ‘flying monk’ whose feats of levitation were witnessedby dozens of famous men of learning, including the philosopher Leibniz. Born inApulia, Italy, in 1603, Giuseppe Desa was—like Richard Church—a sickly boy; and,like Church, he was subject to sudden moods of ecstasy. He was one of thosepersons who feel dissatisfied with the sheer weight of the flesh that they haveto carry around with them, and mortified it with fasting and flagellation. Hebecame a priest at the age of 25. And one day when he was saying mass in his ownchurch of St Gregory of Armenia, he uttered a cry and, in the upright position,flew with his hands outstretched to the cross above the altar. The nuns who werepresent thought he would catch fire on the candles, but moments later he flewback down into the church and began to dance and sing as he chanted the name ofthe Virgin. Later, when seeing the pope, he was again seized with ecstasy androse into the air. And he continued to do so for the remainder of his life—helived to be 60—witnessed by hundreds of people. He seems to have been a simple,happy soul, who did not resent the envy with which he was regarded by his fellowFranciscan monks, and who rose into the air like a balloon every time he wasoverwhelmed by sudden joy.But if we want to understand more about these ‘hidden powers’, it is worthlooking more closely at Richard Church’s experience. And the first thing that isimportant to note is that until he was 7, he was appallingly short-sighted. Whenthis was finally noticed by the school doctor, he was taken along to an opticianwho tested his eyes. He was amazed when the optician dropped lenses into a frameon his nose, and the small letters on an illuminated card suddenly became clear.But this was nothing to his amazement when he first wore the glasses, andrealised that he could suddenly see everything with incredible sharpness andclarity. For the first time he could see the pupils of his mother’s eyes, thehairs on his father’s moustache. When he stepped out onto the pavement, it ‘cameup and hit me’, so he had to grab hold of his father:‘The lamplight! I looked in wonder at the diminishing crystals of gas-flamestrung down the hill. Clapham was hung with necklaces of light, and the horsespulling the glittering omnibuses struck the granite road with hooves of iron andebony. I could see the skeletons inside the flesh and blood of theSaturday-night shoppers. The garments they wore were made of separate threads.In this new world sound as well as sight was changed. It took on hardness anddefinition, forcing itself upon my hearing, so that I was besiegedsimultaneously through the eye and through the ear.‘How willingly I surrendered! I went out to meet this blazing and trumpetinginvasion. I trembled with the excitement, and had to cling to mother’s arm toprevent myself being carried away in the flood as the pavements rushed at me,and people loomed up with their teeth like tusks, their lips luscious, theireyes bolting out of their heads, bearing down on me as they threw out spears ofconversation that whizzed loudly past my ears and bewildered my wits.‘“Is it any different?” asked Jack . . .‘“It makes things clearer,” I replied, knowing that I had no hope of telling himwhat was happening to me.’If you can read this passage with indifference, then you are missing the point.It is about far more than a boy’s first pair of spectacles. To grasp its realsignificance, ask yourself the following question: was his new vision of theworld more or less true than his old one of a few minutes earlier? The answerhas to be: truer, for blurred vision is obviously less accurate than clearvision. And the implications of this reply are tremendous. For it means that therest of us are normally blind to the reality around us.How can this be? After all, few of us are as short-sighted as Church was, and,in these days of Social Security, no one need be without spectacles. Yet we are,in effect, just as short-sighted as the young Church, for we take the world forgranted. We have a kind of robot inside us, who does things for us. You learn toread slowly and painfully, then the robot does it so fast that you are not evenaware of ‘reading’ these words: they seem to be speaking to you from the page.The robot is typing this book. He drives my car and sometimes even giveslectures for me. But he also takes over all kinds of other things which I wouldprefer to do myself. I take my dogs for a walk on the cliffs, but they enjoy itmuch more than I do because their robot is less efficient. Mine makes me taketoo much ‘for granted’. He glances at something, says ‘Oh yes, we know all aboutthat . . .’, and prevents me from really seeing it. It is just as if I spent mylife wearing a dark pair of sun-glasses.But does this really matter? In some ways, no. I get just as much exercisewhether I walk ‘robotically’ or not, and a meal supplies me with just as muchenergy whether I eat mechanically or not. The real trouble arises if I begin tofeel depressed or discouraged. These sun-glasses make the world so much darker.But my vitality—and therefore my health—depends upon enthusiasm. It depends upona certain eagerness. It depends upon noticing differences.Ouspensky tells a story that makes the same point. He describes how he and afriend were crossing the River Neva in St Petersburg.‘We had been talking, but both fell silent as we approached the [Peter and Paul]fortress, gazing up at its walls and making probably the same reflection. “Inthere are also factory chimneys,” said A. Behind the walls of the fortressindeed appeared some brick chimneys blackened by smoke.‘On his saying this, I too sensed the difference between the chimneys and theprison walls with unusual clearness and like an electric shock. I realised thedifference between the very bricks themselves. . . .‘Later in conversation with A, I recalled this episode, and he told me that notonly then, but always, he sensed these differences and was deeply convinced oftheir reality.’And Ouspensky goes on to say that the wood of a gallows, a crucifix, the mast ofa ship is, in fact, a quite different material in each case. Chemical analysiscould not detect it; but then, chemical analysis cannot detect the differencebetween two twins, who are nevertheless quite different personalities. Ouspenskybegins this important chapter with a paragraph that ought to be written inletters 20 feet high:‘It seems to us that we see something and understand something. But in realityall that proceeds around us we sense only very confusedly, just as a snailsenses confusedly the sunlight, the darkness and the rain.’1A similar experience was reported by the American psychologist Abraham Maslow,who had been told of it by a marine who had been stationed in the Pacific forseveral years and had not seen a woman. When he came back to base, he saw anurse, and immediately had a ‘peak experience’—an experience of suddenoverwhelming delight—as it suddenly struck him with a kind of shock that womenare different from men. We say ‘Of course women are different from men’, yetthese words disguise the fact that we have allowed the robot to obliterate thereal difference. We do not see it with that sense of shock and amazementexperienced by the marine—although it is true that a man might experiencesomething similar if he walked past an open doorway and caught a glimpse of awoman removing her clothes. And this example makes us aware that we have simplyallowed our senses to collapse. You could compare them to a tent that has beenblown flat, so it is no longer of much use as a shelter. Because of thiscollapse of our senses, they cannot do their proper work, which is to show usthe differences between things.In short, I am suggesting that it is the ‘robot’ who destroys our ‘magical’powers, and prevents us all from being able to float through the air likeRichard Church or Joseph of Copertino.Let us look more closely into this fascinating problem.You may feel that the idea of floating through the air is just a little too muchto swallow. Yet there is another odd faculty which seems to be closely relatedto it, and which thousands of people have reported: I mean the odd ability to bein two places at once.When the Society for Psychical Research was formed in London in 1882, itreceived hundreds of reports of people who had ‘seen’ other people who were notactually in the room. In many of these cases, the person who appeared was aboutto die, or had just died, and the person who saw him (or her) was a closerelative. So such ‘apparitions’ could be explained either as ghosts, or—if youdid not believe in ghosts—as some kind of telepathy. In a typical case, a mansitting in his room in Dublin awoke in the night and saw his father—who was onhis deathbed in Wales—sitting in a chair with his face covered by his hands; amoment later, he vanished. The man was so impressed that he rushed over toWales, and found that his father had been delirious for two days. And when heentered the room, his father remarked that he had been to see him the day before. . .1But the Society also received hundreds of reports of people who were not ill orin any danger being seen in other places. These they called ‘phantasms of theliving”, and the case cited above is from one of its earliest and mostimpressive compilations. The following typical case is recounted by the poetW.B. Yeats:‘One afternoon . . . I was thinking very intently of a fellow student for whom Ihad a message, which I hesitated about writing. In a couple of days I got aletter from a place some hundreds of miles away where the student was. On theafternoon when I had been thinking so intently I had suddenly appeared thereamid a crowd of people in a hotel and seeming as solid as if in the flesh. Myfellow student had seen me, but no one else, and had asked me to come again whenthe people had gone. I had vanished, but had come again in the middle of thenight and given him the message. I had myself no knowledge of eitherapparition.’1What seems to have happened here is that Yeats’s anxiety to deliver the messagesomehow caused him to ‘project’ his image several hundred miles, where itapparently behaved like a normal person. And in the case of the man who wasdying in Wales, we may again surmise that the father’s anxiety (in fact, hewanted to tell his son the whereabouts of an overcoat) again caused him to‘project’ himself to Dublin. And it is a plausible hypothesis that when peopleare on the point of dying, they are able to tap some unconscious power whichallows them to ‘show themselves’ to some close relative about whom they areanxious. (In the same way, there is strong evidence that people who aredrowning, or in some great physical danger, really do see their past livesflashing in front of their eyes within a second or two.)But there are other cases in which people seem to have used this power more orless deliberately. One evening in the the late 1920s, the novelist John CowperPowys had spent the evening dining with the great American writer TheodoreDreiser. Powys suddenly looked at his watch: ‘I must hurry.’ But as he leftDreiser’s New York apartment he remarked: ‘I’ll appear before you later thisevening.’ Then he rushed off to catch his train to upstate New York. Dreiserassumed the comment was a joke. But two hours later, as he sat reading, helooked up and found Powys standing by the door. He stood up, saying: ‘John, comein and tell me how you did it.’ At that moment, Powys vanished. Dreiser rushedto the telephone and rang Powys’s home. Powys answered, and, when Dreiser toldhim what had happened, replied: ‘I told you I’d be there.’Dreiser adds that Powys later declined to discuss how he had done it. But thatmay not be because Powys wanted to be secretive. It may be, quite simply, thathe did not know. He probably ‘felt it coming on’ during the evening, an oddstate of mind which he recognised as the ability to ‘project’ himself. And it isalmost certain that he did not know he had done it until Dreiser rang him up.Perhaps the strangest case on record is that of an attractive Frenchschoolmistress named Emilie Sagée who lost 18 jobs in sixteen years because ofher peculiar habit of being in two places at once. The way she lost hereighteenth job is typical. In 1845, she was a teacher at a school for youngladies at Neuwelcke, near Wolmar, on the shores of the Baltic. One day as shewas writing on the blackboard, a second Emilie appeared standing beside her. Asshe turned to see what the pupils were murmuring about, her ‘double’ vanished.On another occasion, she was on her knees beside a girl called Antoinette vonWrangel, pinning her dress, and as the girl looked in the wardrobe mirror, shesaw two Emilies, and fainted.The last straw was when another teacher had left her pupils alone for fiveminutes. Suddenly, they were astonished to see Emilie seated in the teacher’schair. Stranger still, there was another Emilie out in the garden. Two of thebolder pupils tried to touch the apparition, and said it felt like muslin. Oneof them even walked through her. Then the apparition vanished, although theother Emilie could still be seen in the garden. Later, a friendly pupil askedEmilie what had happened. She explained that she had looked into the classroomthrough the garden window, seen that the teacher was absent, and felt worriedthat the girls would misbehave. It seems that, in some strange way, her worryhad projected her ‘double’ into the room.When parents heard these stories they began withdrawing their children from theschool, and Emilie was sacked. She then went to live with her sister-in-law, andeveryone in the family got used to seeing her double wandering around the house.But the strain seems to have been too much for her; one day she left the houseand vanished, never to be seen again. The likeliest explanation is that shedrowned herself.One of the most famous cases recorded by the Society for Psychical Researchconcerns a young student named S.H. Beard, who was engaged to a girl named MissVerity. In November 1881, Beard was sitting in his room in London reading a bookabout the power of the will. It suddenly entered his head that he would like to‘appear’ to Miss Verity, who lived at 22 Hogarth Road, Kensington. Heconcentrated his mind and tried to visualise the house, and the bedroom on thesecond floor where his fiancée slept. Suddenly he became aware that he could notmove his limbs; he felt ‘frozen’. And at that moment, in Hogarth Road, MissVerity woke up and found him standing by her bed. She screamed, and it awoke her11-year-old sister. As the two girls stared at the apparition, it vanished.Beard himself did not know he had succeeded until Miss Verity told him about itnext time he saw her.A month later he decided to try it again. By now Miss Verity and her sister hadmoved to Kew. Once again he made the attempt, writing later: ‘I also put forthan effort which I cannot find words to describe. I was conscious of a mysteriousinfluence of some sort permeating my body, and had a distinct impression that Iwas exercising some force with which I had been hitherto unacquainted, but whichI can now at certain times set in motion at will.’ Half an hour later he ‘cameto’ and realised he had been asleep—or in a trance. The next day he discoveredonce again that he had been successful. But it was not Miss Verity who had seenhim this time, but her married sister. She had seen him walking from one room toanother, and later he had walked into her bedroom, touched her hair, taken herhand in his own and stared intently at the palm before he vanished. The sisterwoke Miss Verity, who was in the same bed, to tell her what had happened.All these stories seem to make the same point made by Richard Church. We take itfor granted that we live in a ‘solid’ world of space and time, advancing frommoment to moment according to unchangeable laws, and that we are stuck in theplace where we happen to be at the moment. We are, in a sense, ‘trapped’. Wefeel this particularly strongly when we are bored or miserable—that we arehelplessly at the mercy of this physical world into which we happen to have beenborn. Yet these odd experiences all seem to show that this is untrue. The ‘realyou’ is not trapped in space and time. With a certain kind of effort of will itcan rise above space and time, and be ‘elsewhere’. Later in this book we shalldiscuss the strange fact that human beings have two brains, and that we all havetwo different ‘selves’ who live one in each of them (see page Pp. 60[../Text/07_chapter02.html#page_60]ff). Brain physiologists have no idea of whywe need two more-or-less identical brains in our heads—one tongue-in-cheeksuggestion is that one of them is a ‘spare’ in case the other gets damaged. Myown belief is that we have two brains, so we can be in two places at the sametime. Human beings are supposed to be capable of being in two places at the sametime. Yet we have not quite discovered the ‘trick’. When we do, we shall be acompletely different kind of creature—no longer the same kind of human being wholives out his life so incompetently on this long-suffering planet, but somethingfar more powerful and purposeful. This is what I mean when I say that I believeman is on the point of an evolutionary leap.But, as I have already explained, I had arrived at this conviction long before Ibegan to take an interest in ‘the occult’. It was already the foundation of myfirst book The Outsider, written almost twenty years earlier. What convinced mewas the curious change in human consciousness that began to take place aroundthe year 1750. What happened, quite simply, was that man suddenly learned todaydream. He began to use his imagination in a completely new way. In fact, youcould almost say that the human beings who existed before 1750 had very littleimagination at all.You probably believe that, if you could take a time machine back to the age ofShakespeare, you would find life far more fascinating than today. In fact, youwould find it incredibly boring and depressing. The streets would have stunk ofdung, urine, dead rats and rotting vegetation—an open sewer ran down the middleof most of them, and rich people wore high platforms on their shoes to keep themfrom getting their feet dirty in the thick mud. But what would really havedepressed you would have been the people themselves. We think of the modern NewYorker or Londoner as a fairly unlovely product of our technologicalcivilisation. But he is a noble and sensitive soul compared to the averageElizabethan. As reflected in the literature of the period, the Elizabethan wasself-centred, stupid—most of them were illiterate—and utterly materialistic. Hewas also appallingly cruel; a mother starving with a child at her breast meantnothing to him, and his favourite entertainment was to attend a publicexecution, in which a man was often branded with hot irons, then half-hanged,then taken down while still alive and torn open so his intestines spilled out.The Elizabethans also loved to attend the playhouse, and their favourite playswere full of blood and violence—like Marlowe’s Tamburlaine the Great or Kyd’sSpanish Tragedy—which ended with the stage piled with corpses.It would be pointless to blame them for this—when life is an endless struggle,people become hard and ruthless. But it is important to recognise that thesepeople were very different from ourselves in one basic respect—that they lackedwhat we would call imagination. Most of us have learned the trick of ‘puttingourselves in other people’s shoes’, of imagining what it would be like to besomeone else. So newspapers can always guarantee a large sale if they have some‘human’ story about a child who has lost his dog, a baby in need of a hearttransplant, a ‘tug of love’ between divorced parents. The Elizabethans wouldhave found this baffling; to hold their attention, a story had to be eitherfarcical or cruel. Don Quixote, one of the most popular novels of the followingcentury, kept its readers in a state of delight by showing its hero being beatenunconscious in every other chapter.The ‘great change’ began in the middle of the 18th century—or, to be moreprecise, in the year 1740. A year earlier, a 50-year-old printer named SamuelRichardson had been asked by a publisher to write a kind of Teach Yourself bookabout the art of letter-writing. Being a natural preacher, Richardson decided towrite letters that would teach his readers about religion and morality as wellas paragraphing and punctuation, so he interspersed business letters andcharacter references with letters full of reproach, good advice and moralobservations. And as he was writing, he recalled a story he had heard twentyyears before, about a pretty ‘lady’s companion’ named Pamela who had been drivento the point of suicide by the determined efforts of her employer’s son toseduce her, but ended by marrying him. The young man’s relatives had at firstregarded her with extreme disapproval, but her ‘dignity, sweetness and humility’had at last won their hearts.The story of Pamela was at first intended to form part of the Familiar Letters,but Richardson’s wife and a young lady guest found it so fascinating that hesoon decided to turn it into a separate book. Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded,appeared—anonymously—on London bookstalls on November 6, 1740, and quicklybecame the literary sensation of the season. The reason is simple: althoughRichardson had intended it as a kind of sermon on the importance of chastity,its readers were more interested by the young master’s attempts to deprivePamela of her virginity—as, for example, when he hides in a cupboard as she getsundressed, then leaps on her and throws her on the bed. (She is saved by theintervention of the housekeeper.) Or later, when he tries to rape her as abrothel madame holds her hands, but is deterred when she has a kind of seizure.This kind of thing kept them reading breathlessly through 800 or so pages.In effect, Pamela was a kind of magic carpet that transported the reader intothe lives of its characters. In our age of the television soap opera, this hasbecome a commonplace; in the 1740s it seemed stunningly original. There had beenplenty of novels about faraway places with strange-sounding names, of whichRobinson Crusoe is still far and away the best. But no one had thought ofwriting about the kind of people who might live next door. Moreover, unlike mostof the novels of the period, Pamela was a long book; the reader could get lostin it for days at a time. It was, in effect, a kind of holiday from beingyourself.The Pamela craze swept across Europe. It produced an immense appetite fornovels, and lending libraries sprang up in every town in the same way thatcinemas sprang up in the first decade of the 20th century. Europe became anation of readers. And sensitive young people made the interesting discoverythat if you found the real world boring and disappointing, there was nothing tostop you from turning your back on it and spending your days living otherpeople’s lives.And it was at this point that the young Wordsworth rowed out into the middle ofthe lake and was overwhelmed by a sense of ‘huge and mighty forms that do notlive’. If he had been born half a century earlier—at about the time Richardsonwas writing Pamela—that experience would have been impossible: he would havebeheld the hills of the Lake District with the same practical eye as the localfarmhands. But half a century of novel-reading had taught people to use theimagination, and it was because he possessed a lively imagination thatWordsworth could experience these strange moods of total freedom and of ‘unknownmodes of being’.There was, of course, one basic problem about these magical excursions into‘other worlds’—they made the real world seem so appallingly dull. Every youngperson has experienced this feeling after an hour or so absorbed in a favouritebook—or videotape. It is like walking out into a cold wind after a hot bath. Thereaction of many of these ‘romantics’—as they called themselves—was to spendstill more time in the magic world of books. And this inevitably made them hatethe real world even more. Many committed suicide; many more died tragically ofillnesses like tuberculosis, brought on by misery and deprivation. And manysimply plodded on sadly, accepting that life is one long disappointment, yetdreaming of better things. One of the most moving episodes in Richard Church’sOver the Bridge describes how a long-haired young man with dirty nails came totune their piano. He smoked continuously as he worked. When he had finished,Richard’s brother Jack asked him if he could give him a few hints on how to playa Beethoven piano sonata—Jack had been wrestling unsuccessfully with it forweeks. ‘The result was like the opening of a weir.’ The scrawny musician tossedback his hair, cracked his knuckles, and proceeded to play. And the two boyslistened in rapt silence as the magnificent music flowed through the room. Whenit was over, the musician wiped his face with a dirty handkerchief. He wassweating, and emitting an odour of mice or bats. And Jack, too moved even tothank him, hurried from the room to ask his father if he could have pianolessons.This picture of the musician, with his unwashed hands and dirty handkerchief,seems to me to capture the essence of the Outsider tragedy. Inside him hecarries around the magnificent world of Beethoven, even a touch of Beethoven’sgenius. How must he have felt as he sat on a crowded bus, jammed between workmenand housewives, wondering whether he had enough money for another packet ofcigarettes? It must have seemed to him that he was a kind of changeling,condemned to a life of servitude by some malicious enchanter. And this, I felt,was one of the major problems of our world: that there are thousands of peoplewho are intelligent enough to make some real contribution to modern life, yetwho are condemned to remain permanently unknown.It was because I was fascinated by this problem of the ‘Outsider’, theintelligent misfit, that I wrote my first book. What seemed so paradoxical wasthat these people were not dying because they hated life. On the contrary, theywanted more life. You could say that they were on strike for a more interestingway of life. The problem was summarised by the great romantic writer Hoffmann inhis novel Murr the Tomcat, in which the mad musician Kreisler tells thePrincess: ‘You seem, your highness, not to be very interested in dreams, and yetit is really in dreams that we grow butterfly wings so that we can esape thisnarrow, tight prison, and fly, like glittering moths, up to the sky, to thehighest heaven.’ And he adds, with typical humour: ‘Every man really has aninnate inclination to fly, and I have known serious, respectable people who inthe late evening fill themselves up with champagne, as a gas useful forascending to the heights, as balloon and passenger at the same time.’‘As balloon and passenger at the same time.’ That was the great romantic dream.But he adds elsewhere in the book: ‘Is it not eternally true that our flight isimpeded by leaden weights that we cannot identify—nor do we know where they comefrom, or who attached them to us.’ Hoffmann himself made heroic attempts to fly,both by writing his famous Tales, and by drinking vast quantities of Germanwine, which ended by ruining his health so he died in the greatest misery.All this explains why I came to believe that man is on the point of anevolutionary breakthrough to a higher stage. He obviously wants to fly—not inthe physical sense, but on the wings of the mind. And, as Bernard Shaw onceremarked: ‘The brain will not fail when the will is in earnest.’So long before I wrote The Occult, I was convinced that we all possess unknownpowers of which we are only dimly aware. But how do we become aware of them? Howdo we learn to make use of them? One thing was obvious to me: that the firststep is to learn to sink inside ourselves. Imagine that someone has offered youa rare wine to taste, a wine that was made while Napoleon was still alive. Thefirst thing you do is to raise it to your lips, and then sink inside yourself,until you are aware of nothing but the smell and taste of the wine. Most of uscan remember doing something of the sort as a child, listening to the rainpattering on the windows, and perhaps rolling up into a ball in the warm bed,totally happy and relaxed. (I knew a girl who told me that whenever she did thisas a child, she used to murmur to herself: ‘Isn’t it nice to be me?’)It is significant that John Cowper Powys, whom we have already encountered,attached great importance to this ‘trick’ of sinking inside himself. Hedescribed it for the first time in a novel called Wolf Solent, which waspublished in 1929—that is, at the same time as the incident when he ‘appeared’to Theodore Dreiser. And this coincidence is enough in itself to make us wonderwhether there might not be some connection between the two. Let us look a littlemore closely at Wolf Solent.The novel opens with a long chapter that is typical of Powys—a description of atrain journey. The opening paragraph sets the tone:‘From Waterloo Station to the small country town of Ramsgard in Dorset is ajourney of not more than three or four hours, but having by good luck found acompartment to himself, Wolf Solent was able to indulge in such an orgy ofconcentrated thought, that these three or four hours lengthened themselves outinto something beyond all human measurement . . .’The first thing you feel is that Powys is in no hurry. You can almost sense himchortling to himself as he settles down—imaginatively—into that railwaycompartment and prepares to indulge in his ‘orgy’ of thinking. So let us try tofollow his example—that is, relax deeply, and forget all impatience. Unless youcan place yourself in that mood of peaceful abandonment, of not caring how longthis takes, you will miss the point of what Powys is saying.‘A bluebottle fly buzzed up and down above his head, every now and then settlingon one of the coloured advertisement of seaside resorts—Weymouth, Swanage,Lulworth and Poole—cleaning its front legs upon the masts of painted ships orupon the sands of impossibly cerulean waters.‘Through the open window near which he sat, facing the engine, the sweet airs ofan unusually relaxed March morning visited his nostrils, carrying fragrances ofyoung green shoots, of wet muddy ditches, of hazel copses full of damp moss, andof primroses on warm grassy hedge-banks.’All this is intended to hypnotise the reader: the buzzing bluebottle, the ‘sweetairs of an unusally relaxed March morning’, the fragrance of green shoots.After introducing us to his hero, and explaining that he is on his way to Dorsetto take a job as a squire’s literary adviser, Powys tells us how much Wolf hatesLondon, with its unending rush, and how much he detests all the barbarousmechanicalness of modern civilisation. In an image that would have far moreappeal now than it had in 1929, he tells us that Wolf sees the whole earth aslooking like a helpless, vivisected frog, ‘scooped and gouged and harrowed’.‘And then’, says Powys, ‘stretching out his legs still further and leaning backagainst the dusty cushions, he set himself to measure the resources of hisspirit against these accursed mechanisms. He did this quite gravely, with nocomic uneasiness at the arrogance of such a proceeding. Why should he not pithis individual magnetic strength against the tyrannous machinery invented byother men?‘In fact, the thrill of malicious exultation that passed through his nerves ashe thought of these things had a curious resemblance to the strange ecstasy heused to derive from certain godlike mythological legends. He would never haveconfessed to any living person the godlike intoxication of personality that usedto come to him from imagining himself a sort of demiurgic force, drawing itspower from the heart of Nature herself.’And as he sits there, watching the telegraph poles flashing past, Wolf imagineshimself to be a prehistoric giant ‘who, with an effortless ease, ran along bythe side of the train, leaping over hedges, ditches, lanes and ponds, and easilyrivalled, in natural born silent speed, the noisy mechanism of all those pistonsand cog-wheels.’Two pages later—Powys is nothing if not leisurely—he tries to analyse this‘mental device’ that gives him so much peculiar strength.‘This was a certain trick he had of doing what he called “sinking into hissoul”. This trick had been a furtive custom with him from very early days. Inhis childhood his mother had often rallied him about it in her light-heartedway, and had applied to these trances, or these fits of absent-mindedness, anamusing but rather indecent nursery name. His father, on the other hand, hadencouraged hm in these moods, taking them very gravely, and treating him, whenunder their spell, as if he were some sort of infant magician.’Wolf calls this peculiar habit ‘mythology’ or ‘mythologising’, an oddlydisappointing name for a concept of such momentous importance. And he admitsthat it makes him feel ‘as if he had been a changeling from a different planet,a planet where the issues of life—the great dualistic struggle between life anddeath—never emerged from the charmed circle of the individual’s privateconsciousness.’In other words, the trouble with our planet is that it keeps us entangled intriviality, so we never get a chance to confront these great issues.What is so interesting about this whole passage is that strange sense of powerthat it expresses. Wolf knows that, when he sinks deep inside himself, he hasthe strength and the ability to ‘measure the resources of his spirit againstthese accursed mechanisms’. He becomes a kind of magician. We can, of course,dismiss this as pure wishful thinking—until we remember how he was able to‘project’ himself back to Dreiser’s apartment in New York.In a later novel Porius, Powys invents an even more unwieldy name for this habitof withdrawing deep inside himself; his young hero has christened it‘cavoseniargizing’—which suggests withdrawing into a cave. What he means is thatthere are certain moments in which the gulf between his body and his soul issomehow bridged, ‘so that his soul found itself able to follow every curve andripple of his bodily sensations, and yet remain suspended above them.’ Wenormally have the sense that the body is a rather unwilling servant that obeysus only reluctantly; yet in moods such as Porius describes, the sense ofunwillingness vanishes, and it seems that the body is simply the visible part ofthe soul. Racing drivers speeding at 200 miles an hour have occasionallydescribed the same odd sensation of being suspended above themselves whilenevertheless wholly in control. It is the sensation that convinced the Romanticsthat man is really a god.At this point, let us return for a moment to those remarks made by Hoffmann’smad musician Kreisler: that ‘it is in dreams that we grow butterfly wings bywhich we can escape our prison and ascend to the highest heavens’, and that‘every man has an innate inclination to fly’. The first remark takes on newsignificance when we think of Dickens’ lady in red, Miss Napier, and the secondwhen we recall Church’s description of the morning he suddenly realised he couldfly. ‘I felt both power and exultation flooding my veins. The blood glowed warmwithin me, rising to my brain and pulsing there . . . I had found out the cheatof time and space . . .’ In short, Church was unconsciously doing what WolfSolent does on the train: he was ‘cavoseniargizing’. And a few moments later, hewas literally flying. Cavoseniargizing seems to be the key to ‘magical’powers—the key, for example, to those preposterous coincidences that Jung called‘synchronicities’, and which he believed were somehow caused by the unconsciousmind.In other words, Powys is really suggesting that we control this curious powerover space and time, and if we knew the trick, could exercise it when we like.Think again of the experience of tasting a very rare wine: the way that you tryto induce what Shaw called ‘the seventh degree of concentration’, and descendinside yourself.I recognise that words like ‘cavoseniargizing’, or even ‘mythologising’, areunlikely to achieve wide popularity: both are too clumsy. But I am not sure myown substitute is any better. I have always called this deliberate‘self-absorption’ subjectivising, bearing in mind Kierkegaard’s remark: ‘Truthis subjectivity.’ He obviously meant this descent into ourselves, as if we werestepping into a lift and pressing the button labelled ‘Basement—7th level’.The romantics saw the answer, but they went about it in the wrong way. Theirproblem, quite simply, was immaturity. If you asked a 5-year-old child toimagine what would make him happiest, he would probably describe some endlessChristmas party with slabs of iced cake and sherry trifles. If you asked ateenage youth what would make him happiest, he would probably describe somecharming girl who would look at him with adoring eyes. The romantics were stillthinking in terms of iced cake and pretty girls.At the beginning of the 19th century, the most famous romantic novelist was aGerman called Richter, known as Jean Paul, whose novels are full of his ownequivalent of Christmas cakes and pretty girls. A glance at his most famousnovel Titan will give us the essence of romanticism in a nutshell. In theopening chapter, its young hero, Count Albano, is returning to Isola Bella(Beautiful Island), the island where he was born, and which he left as a baby.His mother is dead, and he has never seen his own father; now he is returning tomeet his father—an Austrian knight—for the first time. Two friends transport himin a boat to the island during the night, then lead him, blindfolded, up to thetop of the ten garden terraces. As the first rays of the sun gleam on thehorizon, his friend Dian—a Greek painter—pulls off the blindfold:‘“Oh god!” cried Albano with a shriek of ecstasy, as all the gates of the newheaven flew open, and the Olympus of nature, with its thousand reposing gods,stood around him.‘What a world! There stood the Alps, like brother giants of the Old World,linked together, far away in the past, holding high up over against the sun theshining shields of the glaciers. The giants wore blue girdles of forest, and attheir feet lay hills and vineyards, and through the aisles and arches ofgrape-clusters, the morning winds played with cascades as with watered silkribbons, and the liquid brimming mirror of the lake hung down as if suspended bythe ribbons from the mountains, and they fluttered down into the mirror, and acarved work of chestnut woods formed its frame.‘Albano turned slowly round and round, looked into the heights, into the depths,into the sun, into the blossoms; and on all summits burned the alarm fires ofmighty Nature, and in all depths lay their reflections. A creative earthquakebeat like a heart under the earth and sent forth mountains and seas. Oh then,when he saw on the bosom of the infinite mother the little swarming children, asthey darted by under every wave and every cloud—and when the morning breezedrove distant ships in between the Alps—and when the Isola Madre towered upopposite him, with her seven gardens, and tempted him to lean upon the air andbe wafted on a level sweep from his summit to her own—and when he saw thepheasants darting down from the Madre into the waves—then did he seem to standlike a storm bird with ruffled plumage on his blooming nest, his arms werelifted like wings by the morning wind, and he longed to throw himself off theterrace after the pheasants, and to cool his heart in the tide of Nature.’Here we have a kind of verbal equivalent of Van Gogh’s painting The StarryNight, with its flame-like trees and its sky that seethes like a whirlpool withsheer vitality.In fact, Jean Paul does not always write on this ecstatic level; many of hisworks are about humble schoolmasters who live quietly in some small countryvillage, and marry a local girl, and spend their lives peacefully teachingchildren the three Rs, and writing poetry which they never try to publish. Butwhether he is writing of magnificent landscapes or idyllic little villages, wecan see why thousands of young people read Jean Paul with tears in their eyes,and regarded him as the greatest writer since Shakespeare. It seems absurdlyironic that he is now totally forgotten.But what is so interesting here is how much things have changed in the sixtyyears since Pamela. Richardson was a realist; people read him because he wroteabout the sort of people they knew. But if you are going to be carried away by awriter, rather like Sinbad the Sailor being carried up into the air by the roc,you may as well go for stories about young counts with mysterious fathers, whichtake place in the midst of magnificent scenery. If, like most of Jean Paul’sreaders, you had never been outside your native town or village, then why notalso have the benefits of a technicolour travelogue?But as you read Jean Paul’s splendid description of Isola Bella, you will noticethat the mood it attempts to induce is one of abandonment. Like Albano, you aresupposed to cry ‘Oh God!’, and feel as if you want to fling yourself off theterrace and swoop like a bird over the sea. Jean Paul is trying to persuade youto give yourself to this wonderful landscape, like a girl giving herself to alover. And here we encounter the greatest problem of the romantics. They mayhave intuitions of hidden powers, of the ability to fly or to float into the airlike a balloon. But it is all basically Christmas cake and pretty girls. You sitback passively and wait for it to be handed to you on a plate. Church, on theother hand, is excited by his insight to make a sudden effort:‘I exerted that will, visualising my hands and pressing downwards upon thecentre of the earth. It was no surprise to me that I left the ground . . .’And the student Beard, we may recall, had been reading a book about the power ofthe will when he decided to try to ‘appear’ to his fiancée Miss Verity.These ‘hidden powers’ we are speaking about demand a certain effort, anon-passive attitude—something like Powys’s ‘thrill of malicious exultation’,the feeling that he is a ‘demiurgic force’, not a passive creature waiting to beswept off his feet.In the following chapter I want to look more closely at some of these ‘hiddenpowers’, and the methods by which we can contact them. But it is important,above all, to remember that the method for contacting these powers consists in‘subjectivising’, withdrawing inside yourself. This is the basic secret of‘magic’. 1.

Even clever people are inclined to react tooriginal ideas with indifference or hostility. So Mesmer’s amazing contributionbrought him little but trouble, and when he died in 1815, he was virtuallyforgotten. Yet his ideas, as we shall see, are virtually the intellectualcornerstone of modern psychology.Mesmer grew up amidst peaceful mountain scenery, and it left its mark on him fora lifetime. His naturally religious temperament inclined him towards thepriesthood, but after attending a Jesuit university at Dillingen, he came torealise that his immense curiosity pointed to a career in science andphilosophy. So he studied philosophy, then law, and ended up at the age of 32with a medical degree as well. Interestingly enough, his doctoral thesis wascalled ‘The Influence of the Planets Upon the Human Body’. But its thesis wasless absurd than it sounds. Mesmer believed that nature is pervaded by invisibleenergies—the force of gravitation is an example—and that when we are in tunewith these energies, we are healthy. When the energies are blocked, either byphysical problems or negative mental attitudes, we become unhealthy. If theenergies can become unblocked, we become healthy again.This cheerful attitude brought him success, and within two years he had marriedone of his wealthy patients, a widow von Posch, and moved into a magnificenthouse in Vienna, where he counted the Mozarts among his many friends. It lookedas if nothing could stand in the way of a lifetime of good fortune andrespectability.But how can the ‘vital energies’ be unblocked? One obvious way is to induce acrisis—we recognise this when we take aspirin to get rid of a cold by making usperspire. In Mesmer’s day, most doctors tried to induce a crisis by bleeding thepatient, which, amazingly enough, often seemed to work. But there should surelybe easier ways? In 1773, he thought he might have stumbled on the solution. Hisfriend Father Maximilian Hell, the Professor of Astronomy at Vienna University,had been experimenting with magnets, and was inclined to believe that they couldunblock the vital fluids—he even designed specially shaped magnets that wouldfit over various parts of the body. Mesmer tried it out on a patient in 1773,taking with him his friend Leopold Mozart. 29-year-old Franziska Oesterlein layin bed suffering from general debilitation. Mesmer tried applying some of Hell’spowerful magnets, moving them from her stomach down to her feet. After an houror so, Frau Oesterlein reported strange currents moving around her body. Thesebuilt up to a crisis, and she ended by feeling much better. Repeated doses ofthe magnetic treatment soon cured her.Father Hell was naturally inclined to claim the credit, and at first Mesmer wasinclined to give it generously. Then he noticed something rather odd. One daywhen he was bleeding a patient, he noticed that the flow of blood increased whenhe moved close, and decreased when he moved away. It looked as if his own bodywas producing the same effect as the magnets. Instead of using magnets, he beganpassing his hands lightly over the patient. This seemed to work just as well.And as he tried the method on more patients, Mesmer decided that he haddiscovered the basic principle of healing: not ordinary ‘magnetic’ magnetism,but animal magnetism. In 1779 he published a pamphlet on his discovery. To hisastonishment, it aroused general hositility instead of the acclaim he hadexpected from his colleagues in the medical profession. They insisted thatMesmer was a charlatan who cured his patients by mere suggestion—a notion inwhich there was obviously a certain amount of truth. They also suggested thatMesmer’s motives in passing his hands over the bodies of female patients werenot as pure as they should be.As rich patients talked about spectacular cures, the hostility grew. Mesmerspent a week at the estate of Baron Haresky de Horka, who suffered fromunaccountable ‘spasms’ and fits, and he persisted throughout a disappointingweek when it looked as though the baron was failing to respond to treatment. Ittook six days before the baron began to shudder with asthmatic paroxysms. WhenMesmer held the baron’s foot, they stopped; when he held his hand, they startedagain. Clearly, Mesmer was controlling the baron’s vital fluids and making themflow at will. With enough of this, he reasoned, all the blockages should becleared away, like masses of twigs and leaves in a stream, and the energiesshould flow unimpeded. So they did; when Mesmer returned to Vienna, the baronwas cured.Undeterred by mounting hostility, Mesmer thought of new ways of distributing themagnetic fluid: he ‘magnetised’ jars of water, connected up the jars with metalbands, and placed the apparatus in a large wooden tub half-filled with ironfilings and water. Patients sat with their feet in the water, or sat with theirbacks against magnetised trees. The results were remarkable—but his colleaguespointed out that leaving scantily clad men and women in close contact with oneanother would probably stimulate their vital fluids anyway . . .Mesmer’s good angel was off-duty on the day he agreed to treat a blind youngpianist named Maria Theresa Paradies, a protégée of the Empress. He was unawarethat her blindness was due to a detached retina. Oddly enough, after a few weeksof treatment in Mesmer’s house, the girl became convinced she could see dimly. AProfesor Barth was sent to examine her, and he admitted privately to Mesmer thatshe seemed to have improved. But his report stated that she was stillblind—which was undoubtedly true. The girl had be be dragged away from Mesmer’shouse by force. And Mesmer, tired of insults and threats, decided to move toParis in 1778.Here he met with the same mixture of acclaim and vilification. Dr CharlesD’Eslon, personal physician to the king’s brother, became an ardent admirer, andlectured on Mesmer’s ideas to the Society of Medicine on September 18, 1790.Mesmer’s mixed-group cures continued to attract dozens of wealthy patients, whowould sit with their feet in the wooden tub or baquet, and form a chain andpress their bodies together to facilitate the flow of vital fluid. One patient,Major Charles du Hussay, was cured of the after-effects of typhus, which hadturned him into a trembling wreck, by a ‘crisis’ that made his teeth chatter fora month, but which left him perfectly restored. Cases like this so impressed theking that he offered Mesmer a lifelong pension to remain in France; Mesmerdemanded half a million francs for research. When the king refused, he leftFrance—on the same day that D’Eslon was lecturing to the medical faculty—andreturned only when his patients contributed 350,000 gold louis, many times morethan what he had asked for. But Mesmer had made an enemy of the king, whoappointed a ‘commission’ of scientists to look into Mesmer’s ideas. It includedthe great American Benjamin Franklin, the chemist Lavoisier (who was to lose hishead in the Revolution) and the inventor of a new decapitation machine, acertain Dr Guillotin. It is an episode that reflects discredit on Franklin, whowas much prejudiced against Mesmer. He was also ill, so that he did not actuallyattend any of the ‘experiments’. But he signed the report which dismissed‘animal magnetism’ as mere imagination. Mesmer was actually absent from Franceat the time (1794) and was not even consulted. He returned, but nothing couldrestore his fortunes. A hostile doctor introduced himself as a patient, allowedMesmer to ‘cure’ him, then wrote a report denouncing him as a quack. This kindof thing was unanswerable. After the Revolution (during which he lost all hismoney) Mesmer fled. The Austrian police prevented him from returning to Vienna.He spent his last quarter of a century living quietly in Constance, not far fromhis birthplace.Now it may seem to many open-minded readers that Mesmer’s critics were by nomeans incorrect: that his theories were absurd, and that his cures were, indeed,due to ‘suggestion’. Yet this is really to miss the point. We must remember, tobegin with, that medicine in the time of Mesmer was completely ‘materialistic’,in the sense that it was firmly believed that all medical problems are physicalin origin, (to which they added as a corollary: ‘and can be cured by bleeding’.)Even if we take the least sympathetic view of Mesmer, we have to recognise thathe had stumbled on a recognition of tremendous importance: that the mind playsas much a part in illness as the body. If his sceptical colleagues had beenopen-minded enough to study his cures, instead of attacking them as quackery,they would have found themselves asking questions that would have created ascience of psychology a century before Freud.Second, our conviction that Mesmer’s ideas about magnetism and ‘animalmagnetism’ are based on pure ignorance may well be incorrect. Well into the late19th century, many doctors were still conducting serious experiments withmagnets, and producing some extremely interesting results—for example, causingparalysis to move from one side of the body to the other. We have forgotten allthis, and our descendants may well shake their heads at our complacency.Moreover, in the 20th century, another remarkable rebel, Wilhelm Reich, cameindependently to the conclusion that health is governed by ‘tides’ of vitalfluid; he called this ‘orgone energy’. Reich was, in many ways, a crank; he wasmore Freudian than Freud, and believed that all illness can be explained interms of sexual neurosis. Yet his indifference to current scientific dogmas ledhim to some interesting discoveries which may well be one day considered as animportant contribution to modern science.It may also be mentioned in passing that it has now been scientificallyestablished that the human body possesses an ‘aura’ or ‘life-field’, which seemsto be electrical in nature. A young biologist named Hans Driesch divided a seaurchin’s egg into two and killed off one half; the other half did not turn intohalf a sea urchin embryo; to his surprise, it turned into a perfect but smallerembryo. When he pressed two embryos together they turned into a double-sizeembryo. Driesch realised that there must be a kind of invisible blueprint, likea magnetic field, which ‘shapes’ living things, just as a magnet can shape ironfilings on a sheet of paper. A later experimenter, Harold Saxton Burr,discovered that he could measure this ‘life-field’ with a voltmeter, anddiagnose illness from its fluctuations. In effect, he has placed what occultistscall ‘the human aura’ on a scientific basis. This is almost certainly whatMesmer was affecting with his magnetic fields.But Mesmer is the father of modern psychology in a far more important sense.One of his wealthier disciples in Paris was a marquis named Armand Marie-Jacquesde Chastenet, surnamed Puységur, and he and his two younger brothers had paidMesmer the vast sum of 400 louis for training in his techniques. He thenproceeded to apply them with enthusiasm to the servants and tenants on hisestate at Buzancy, near Soissons, his first step being to ‘magnetise’ a limetree in the park. One of the servants was a 20-year-old shepherd named VictorRace, and Puységur proceeded to tie him to the lime tree, and to make ‘magnetic’gestures in front of his face. After a few ‘passes’, Victor closed his eyes andfell asleep. The marquis ordered him to wake up and untie himself. To hissurprise, Victor untied himself without opening his eyes. Then he went wanderingoff across the park. Puységur was baffled; he knew he had induced some kind of atrance, but had no idea of its nature. More than 2 centuries later, science isstill in roughly the same position.What Puységur had done, of course, was to stumble upon hypnosis—a technique thatlater came to be called (incorrectly) ‘mesmerism’. (Mesmer himself preferred tocall it somnambulism—the word hypnotism was invented in 1843 by James Braid.)And as he continued to practise on Victor, Puységur made some bafflingdiscoveries—for example, that he could give Victor mental orders, and theshepherd would respond just as if they were spoken aloud. Moreover, Puységurcould hold conversations with Victor in which his own part was unspoken, andVictor would reply just as if he had spoken aloud. Victor could even be made tostop speaking in the middle of a word. Puységur describes in his Memoirs in Aidof a History of Animal Magnetism (1809) how he even got Victor to repeat thewords of a song which he—the marquis—was singing mentally. What was equallyinteresting was that Victor was normally a rather stupid young man, but thatwhen hypnotised, he became far more intelligent and perceptive.That this was no fluke was proved in experiments with another subject namedMadeleine. In front of an audience, Puységur would place her in a trance, giveher various mental orders—which she would carry out—then invite members of theaudience to transmit to her their own mental orders—for example, asking her topick up a certain object. Again and again, without hesitation, Madeleine wentstraight to the object and picked it up. To demonstrate that Madeleine was notsimply wide-awake and peeping (in spite of having her eyes closed), he wouldblindfold her with a thick piece of cloth; it made no difference to herimmediate response to mental suggestions. One sceptic—a baron—suspected thatPuységur had some code by which he communicated with Madeleine, and asked forthe experiment to be conducted in the home of a mutual friend, M. Mitonard.Puységur agreed, and in Mitonard’s home, lost no time in hypnotising Madeleineand placing her ‘in rapport’ with Mitonard. Mitonard when gave her variousmental orders, and watched her carry them out. Suddenly, Mitonard stood as iflost in thought. After a moment, Madeleine reached into his pocket, and broughtout three small screws she found there; Mitonard admitted that he had put themthere for that purpose, and that now he was totally convinced. So was anothersceptic called Fournel, who had stated that nine-tenths of these strange‘magnetic’ phenomena were due to fraud; but when Fournel himself was able to‘mentally’ order a hypnotised subject—with blindfolded eyes—to go to a table,select a hat from a number of other objects, and put it on his head, he had toadmit that fraud had to be ruled out.Now quite clearly these experiments were among the most important ever conductedin the history of scientific research. It obviously makes no difference ifFournel was correct in saying that nine-tenths of the people who performed suchtricks in public were frauds; it is the other tenth that matters. What Puységurhad demonstrated beyond all doubt was that telepathy exists (although the wordwould not be invented for another century). He, of course, thought it was‘magnetism’—that his own magnetic current was influencing the hypnotised subjectjust as a magnet influences a compass needle. Perhaps he was not entirely wrong.Whatever the explanation, Puységur had virtually demonstrated ‘magic’ in public.He had also totally undermined the kind of materialism that was becoming sofashionable at the time, and which asserted that man is a machine, and that themind is a mere product of the body, just as heat and light are products ofburning coal. Puységur had proved that mind is in some way independent of thebody and higher than the body.His demonstrations should have caused the greatest sensation since the inventionof the wheel. Why did they not? Because of the unfortunate accident of beingassociated with the highly suspect name of Mesmer. Mesmer was a fraud.‘Magnetism’ was really due to suggestion. Therefore hypnotism was also a fraud,and all the demonstrations in the world failed to prove otherwise. The hostilitywas so tremendous that ‘mesmerism’ was made illegal in France (and much the samein Austria), and a doctor who even expressed his support for the ideas ofMesmer—let alone practised them—could lose his license. The medical professionwas in a state of near-hysteria, determined to stamp it out, if necessary, withfire and sword. Mesmerism remained—scientifically speaking—a pariah throughoutmost of the 19th century, and any doctor who became interested in it did well tokeep silent.The storm had still not blown itself out by 1809, when Puységur published hisfirst book on hypnotism. Anything to do with Mesmer was still regarded with thedeepest hostility. But many doctors took to heart Jussieu’s comment that thephenomena deserved further investigation, and conducted their own experiments.D’Eslon—Mesmer’s original French advocate—recorded a case of a man who couldplay cards with his eyes closed. A Dutch experimenter described a case of ahypnotised boy who could read with his fingertips and a girl who could read hismind and describe people and places he knew (but she didn’t). A Germanexperimenter described an epileptic boy who could distinguish colours with thesoles of his feet, even when he had stockings on. In Baden, a hypnotised girlcorrectly read a message in a sealed envelope—even though the hypnotist himselfdid not know what it was. In Sweden, a professor described a girl who was ableto read a book when it was placed open on her stomach, while her eyes wereblindfolded. This particular phenomenon was observed again and again with‘sensitives’. In England, a young schoolteacher named Alfred Russel Wallace—whowas later to share with Darwin the honour of ‘discovering’ evolution—found thatone of his pupils, under hypnosis, could share his own sense of taste and smell;when Wallace tasted salt, he grimaced; when Wallace tasted sugar, he madedelighted sucking motions. When Wallace stuck a pin in himself, the boy jumpedand rubbed the appropriate part of his body.What all this clearly demonstrated was that human beings have ‘unknown powers’which are not generally recognised. But since they are so easy to demonstrate inthe laboratory, they obviously ought to be recognised. Then why were theyignored? Let us not be too harsh on those doctors and scientists who denouncedMesmer. It was not pure stupidity and wickedness. Science was simply not readyfor these discoveries. It was plodding along at its own slow pace, discoveringelectricity, atoms, meteorites. (In 1768, the great chemist Lavoisier—whoreported unfavourably on Mesmer—was asked by the French Academy of Sciences togo and investigate a great ‘stone’ that had fallen from the sky at a placecalled Luce. His report stated that all the witnesses had to be mistaken, for‘stones’ did not and could not fall out of the sky; it was not until thefollowing century that the existence of meteorites was acknowledged by science.)If science had rushed on much faster, it might have been led into all kinds ofuntrue assumptions—as Mesmer was.On the other hand, there can be no doubt that Mesmer and Puységur would haveshaken their heads in amazement if told that, two centuries after theirdiscoveries, science still refuses to acknowledge them. That is carryingconservatism to the point of sheer mulishness.Of course, we now accept hypnosis as a reality. That came about in the lastdecades of the 19th century, mostly through the researches of the great Frenchdoctor Jean-Martin Charcot, who ran the Salpêtrière Hospital (mostly for verypoor patients) in Paris. Charcot was puzzled by the phenomenon of hysteria—how awoman could believe she was pregnant, and her stomach swell up, or a man believehis arm was paralysed, and be unable to move it. He soon discovered that hecould induce exactly the same effects by hypnosis, and he gave amazingdemonstrations in which people would drop on all fours and bark like dogs, orflap their arms when told they were birds, or even eat a lump of charcoal withrelish when told it was chocolate. Because Charcot was practising on poordown-and-outs, his rich medical colleagues did not feel threatened as Mesmer’scolleagues had. And they were completely won over when Charcot announced hisconclusion that hypnosis was just another form of hysteria. That made itperfectly all right. Of course, Charcot was mistaken. We can see perfectly wellthat, in fact, hysteria is a form of hypnosis; the hysterically pregnant womanhas, in effect, hypnotised herself—convinced her unconscious mind that she ispregnant, so it causes her stomach to swell. However, Charcot’s error had oneexcellent effect, in that it made hypnotism more-or-less respectable again. Anda young doctor called Freud, who had come from Vienna to study under Charcot,was deeply impressed by the phenomena of hypnosis, and reasoned that it must becaused by some part of the mind which is far more powerful than our everydayconsciousness. So Mesmer’s discovery had led, in a roundabout way, to thefoundation of modern psychology.But Freud’s interpretation of hypnosis—that it merely demonstrates the enormoushidden powers of the unconscious—only confirmed the view that was originallyheld by Mesmer’s colleagues: that it was all a matter of ‘suggestion’. If youtell a hypnotised man that you are about to touch his arm with a red-hot poker,and in fact you touch it with an icicle, he screams with pain, and will developa blister. This is merely a demonstration of the immense powers of theunconscious mind. But it is not a case of ‘mind over matter’, for theunconscious is really a kind of gigantic machine—far bigger and more powerfulthan the puny mechanisms of the conscious mind. Freud won over the scientists soeasily because his view was so determinedly realistic.But what if someone had asked Freud—or Charcot, for that matter—how a hypnotisedgirl could read a book placed open on her stomach, or obey orders given to hermentally? How could this be explained in terms of ‘unconscious suggestion?’ Theanswer of course, is that it cannot be. Which means that, as far as modernscience is concerned, some of the most important findings of Mesmer, Puységur,D’Eslon, Alfred Russel Wallace and the rest, are still ignored. Hypnosis is‘suggestion’, and that is that.It follows, of course, that no one can be induced to do something under hypnosisthat he—or she—would not do when normally awake. And yet, as we shall see, thisis a highly questionable assertion. Consider, for example, ‘the Story of theWicked Magician Thimotheus’, as described by Professor Heinz E. Hammerschlag inhis book Hypnose und Verbrechen (Hypnotism and Crime):‘One March evening in the year 1865, there was a knock at the door of an honestworkman in the village of Solliès-Farliede (Bar). He lived in the house togetherwith his two children, a boy of fifteen and a girl called Josephine, agedtwenty-six. Josephine opened the door and was deeply frightened, without knowingwhat there was about the man standing there that could awaken such a feeling ofterror. Certainly he was ugly, unkempt, and club-footed; and he gave her tounderstand by a sign that he was a deaf-mute. In addition, there was somethingabout this terribly neglected man which filled her with fear, so that she wouldgladly have turned him away. But her father had compassion for the pitiful stateof the beggar; and he allowed him to come into their living-room and to jointhem at supper which was ready on the table. During the meal Josephine had achance of more closely watching this man, whose long black hair and untidy beardfilled her with revulsion. A cold shudder passed down her spine when she saw hisstrange habits while he ate. When he poured out some wine for himself, he didnot, for example, fill his glass at one time but usually put it down three timesbefore it was filled, and never took a sip from the glass without first making asign of the cross over it.‘Later in the evening, some neighbours who had heard about the peculiar strangercalled at the house. The conversation was carried on very painfully with paperand pencil. It emerged that the deaf-mute stranger was a cork-cutter namedThimotheus Castellan who had had to give up his occupation because of an injuryto his hand and who now travelled through the country as a healer, magnetizerand water-diviner. His signs and his mysterious behaviour made a greatimpression on the simple peasants. Only Josephine, out of fear, remained silent.When the stranger was later brought to the haystack for the night, she remainedon the bed in her room fully dressed and for many hours could not fall asleep.Nevertheless, the night passed without anything unusual happening. The followingmorning, her brother was the first to leave the house to go to work. He wasfollowed afterwards by her father and the stranger.‘Before some minutes had passed the beggar returned by himself to the housewhere he found Josephine occupied with her work. She dared not turn him away,although the same feeling of anxiety overcame her as on the previous day. He satin silence near the hearth and watched the girl at her work. Their silence wasrepeatedly interrupted by visits from neighbours who evidently regarded thestranger as someone endowed with unusual powers. They observed him withastonishment and even brought him articles of food as presents. Just as one ofthe neighbours, without being noticed, entered the kitchen he saw the strangermaking mysterious signs with his hand behind the girl’s back. Josephine herselfseemed restless and excited and was obviously very glad to see any visitor whointerrupted her isolation with the beggar, the cause of so much anxiety. Buttowards noon she could no longer avoid being alone with him. For they sattogether at the mid-day meal, which she provided for him so as not to let him goaway hungry.‘And now the incomprehensible happened: Josephine had just begun to eat, whenthe man stretched out his hand and made a movement with two fingers as if hewere going to put something into the spoon which she was taking to her mouth. Atthe same moment she felt that she was becoming unconscious. She came to as theman was standing in front of her and sprinkling her with cold water. Then, soshe later reported, he took her in his arms, carried her into her room and thereviolated her. While this took place she was fully conscious, but in spite of allher efforts she could not ward off the fiend nor could she, by knocking on thewall, draw the attention of neighbours; she could not even answer a relative whoknocked at the door and called for her.‘Early in the evening the neighbours, to their astonishment, saw Josephine leavethe house in the company of the lame beggar. She gave the impression of beingvery disturbed, and called out to her acquaintances unintelligently andincoherently. No one understood how the girl, whose reputation was unstained,could follow the man on the road; yet no one tried to prevent her or ask herwhat was the cause of her behaviour.‘For two days the unusual pair roamed about in the surrounding area. At nightthey found refuge with a farmer who took pity on the girl without, however,being able to persuade her to return home. On the third day, they came to thevillage of La Cappelude and stayed at a farmhouse. Here a most unusual scene wassoon enacted. Josephine fell from one extreme to the other: at one moment shesmothered her companion with tenderness, at the next she pushed him away in fearand disgust. Here as well, the neighbours came running as soon as they heard ofthe unusual visitor.‘In the evening Josephine asked a girl from a neighbouring house to let her staythere for the night. But her companion forbade her to leave him, and as shewanted to go in spite of that, he made some mysterious signs over her body.Whereupon Josephine fell into his arms and remained as if paralysed for nearlyan hour. The beggar then asked a neighbour, ‘Shall I make her laugh?’ and sheimmediately burst into a mad, yelling laughter. ‘Now I will bring her back toherself,’ he said, and slapped her face violently three times. Soon Josephineseemed to awaken from a deep sleep without having felt any mistreatment; shelaughed and said she felt very well. They were given a room in the house for thenight. When everyone in the house was asleep, a dreadful noise was heard comingfrom their room. The farmer armed himself with a stick, intending to throw thebeggar out of the house as quickly as he could, but Josephine refused to followthe farmer’s advice not to go with the beggar, so they were allowed to remain inthe house. The next morning, in the presence of the members of the household andneighbours, the man made Josephine crawl about the room like an animal. Thisenraged the onlookers and they threw him out of the house. He had hardly leftthe room when the girl got into a dreadful state; suddenly she could neitherspeak nor move her arms; a stark and confused expression came over her face.Those present could think of no other way of helping her than by calling thebeggar back. Scarcely had he stepped into the room, when the girl’s fixed gazeleft her. Murmuring some unintelligible words, he got her out of her fearfulstate by using his strange methods, at the same time once more giving her threeslaps in the face. Then they both left the house.‘On the following day, they met some hunters who spoke to them. While thebeggar, who had suddenly recovered his speech, was talking to them, the girlsucceeded in getting away unnoticed. By hiding under a hill she eluded pursuitand, after a long search, found her way to the village she had left in themorning. There she met some kind-hearted men who took her home. On the way back,she was repeatedly overcome by states of excitement which sometimes seemed likeattacks of rage. A doctor was brought and Josephine was given a thorough medicalexamination. The doctor found that the girl was suffering from fever and nervousstrain; according to his opinion there was no mental disturbance. After aboutsix weeks of rest she was well again; at any rate the excitement and attacks ofanxiety stopped.‘In the meantime Thimotheus Castellan was arrested for vagrancy and begging.During the enquiry the court considered the question whether the young girl’swill-power was so weakened by the “magnetic influences” exerted by the accusedthat the intimate relations between them constituted rape.‘Two physicians were charged to express their expert opinion on this question.In their report they stated:‘We the undersigned declare . . .:(1) That by the so-called magnetic effect on the will of any person who isdisposed to it by nervous temperament, an influence can be exerted such that theperson’s moral freedom is completely perverted or more or less destroyed.(2) That if one puts a young girl into magnetic sleep one can have intimaterelations with her of which, when she awakens, she has no knowledge.(3) That it is possible, by the effect of magnetism, to blunt the feelings somuch and to weaken the will of a young girl to such an extent that, without herbeing completely asleep, she no longer has the necessary moral freedom to resistintimacy, or to give her consent to it with full understanding.’‘On the basis of this report and the confirmation of its outcome by three otherdoctors, Castellan was sentenced by the court to twelve years’ hard labour.’Here it seems clear that the doctors were correct, and that Josephine ‘no longerhad the necessary moral freedom’ to prevent her rape or abduction. Perhaps themost interesting part of the narrative is the neighbour’s description of seeingCastellan make ‘mysterious signs with his hand’ behind her back, and Josephine’ssubsequent deposition that he stretched out his hand and made a movement withtwo fingers, which had the effect of causing her to become unconscious. Itsounds as if Castellan hypnotised Josephine without any of the normalpreliminaries of hypnotic induction—in fact, simply by an exercise of willpower.This also appears to be true in another celebrated criminal case reported byHammerschlag, which he describes as ‘a case of criminal exploitation of hypnosisunique in the history of criminology and hypnotism’.In the late summer of 1934, a Heidelberg official (Hammerschlag calls him H.E.)reported to the local police that his wife had been swindled out of 3,000 marks.The swindler, he thought, was a man who posed as a doctor, and he even believedthat he had been sexually abusing Mrs E. The lady herself remembered that the‘doctor’ had often sent her to sleep by placing his hand on her head, but to allother questions answered: ‘I can’t remember.’ Mrs E. had no history of mentalillness—in fact, she came of healthy farming stock.The police turned the case over to Dr Ludwig Mayer, who found that he was ableto place Mrs E. under hypnosis. But she seemed unable to answer any questionsabout her ‘illness’. Eventually, she was able to make a preliminary statement:‘Before I was married I was once travelling from home to Heidelberg wishing togo to a doctor because I had stomach pains. On the way a man got into mycompartment and seated himself opposite me. He had a conversation with me, webegan to talk about my sickness and he said that he could see immediately that Iwas ill. He said that he was a nature healer and homeopath, presenting himselfas Dr Bergen from Karlsruhe-Daxlanden, and explained that it was just the kindof illness that I had that he could treat very well. When the train stopped atGraben he invited me to join him in a cup of coffee. I didn’t want to because Ifelt so insecure. But he was very helpful as I got out of the train and carriedmy case. Suddenly, he took hold of my hand and it seemed to me as if I no longerhad a will of my own. I felt so strange and giddy. Later he ordered me verballyand by letter to come to Karlsruhe or even to Heidelberg, at the station, wherehe always met me. I no longer know the place in which he treated me.‘I was often in a room at Heidelberg but I no longer know where. He met me atTiefburg, took my hand and said that it was very dark around me. After a longwalk we went up two steps, he opened the door and then it became light again.The room was small and simple, with a couch and a table . . . he placed his handon my forehead and said: ‘You are getting calmer and calmer!’ I do not know whathe did to me. I cannot remember any more. . . .’Soon after this, a swindler named Franz Walter was arrested for other crimes;his description sounded so much like that of ‘Dr Bergen’ that Mrs E. was askedto identify him. She thought it was the same man, but he denied it. But Dr Mayerwas convinced he was lying. He began the long and painful process of ‘unlocking’Mrs E’s memory. Little by little, an amazing story emerged. After causing Mrs E.to fall into a trance on that first day, Walter had taken her to his room, madeher lie on a couch, then placed her arms behind her and told her that she couldnot move. After that, he had raped her. He had then ordered her to lose allmemory of this event.Later, Walter had ordered her to become a prostitute. The men to whom he soldher were taught a ‘magic word’, ‘Combarus’, which would make her do whateverthey asked. Walter took all the money she earned.But after her marriage, her husband became suspicious about the amount of moneyshe was spending. She told Walter that her husband was thinking of going to thepolice. He then told her that the best thing she could do would be to ‘get ridof him’. She was ordered to buy poison and put it in his food. This plan failedwhen her husband ordered her not to go out that evening. Next she was told totake a pistol out of the drawer, shoot him in the head, then place it in hishands as if he had committed suicide. She actually pointed the gun at herhusband’s head when he was asleep and pulled the trigger; but he had taken theprecaution of removing all the bullets. Walter next ordered her to pick poisonmushrooms and to feed them to her husband with ordinary edible ones; he did notlike the taste, and pushed them away after a mouthful. Even so, he was strickenwith diarrhoea and vomiting. She gave him a white powder that Walter had orderedher to slip into his coffee; but she had spilt most of it in her pocket, and thesmall amount she used only gave him stomach-ache.Walter’s next—and fortunately his last—scheme was to kill the husband bytampering with the brakes on his motor-cycle. On the first occasion he cameclose to crashing into a moving train at a level crossing; on the second, heinjured an arm and a knee.Having failed in his attempts to kill her husband, Walter now ordered her tokill herself. His first instruction was to take an overdose of sleeping tabletson an empty stomach; but her own doctor refused to prescribe the tablets. Afterthis Walter ordered her to jump out of a moving train; but she fell intoconversation with a comforting elderly lady who drove all thoughts of suicidefrom her head. Walter now assured her that her husband was in love with anotherwoman and meant to leave her; he ordered her to drown herself in the Rhine.Fortunately, her housekeeper noticed her distress and followed her, preventingher from jumping.And so, finally, the husband went to the police, Franz Walter was arrested onanother charge, and Ludwig Mayer solved the case by ‘unblocking’ the hypnoticsuggestions by which Walter had tried to prevent her from recalling what hadhappened. Franz Walter was found guilty, and received ten years in jail.The most obviously striking thing about this story is that Walter did nothypnotise her by saying ‘Look into my eyes’ and making mesmeric passes with hisfingers. He simply took her hand. How could that happen? The advocates of‘suggestivism’ would argue that he had already made suggestions that placed herin his power, and that taking her hand—with its ‘invasion of her personalspace’—merely confirmed it. But there is nothing in her account to suggest thatthis is so. Here, as in the case of the wicked magician Thimotheus, it looks asif hypnosis was induced by the direct influence of one mind on another.The same conclusion seems to emerge from a more recent case, described by thescience journalist Robert Temple, in his monumental book Open to Suggestion(1989).In January 1985, Maria Malheiras, a Portuguese woman living in London, wasaccosted by a Portuguese man who seemed to be in some distress, and who askedher if she knew of a clinic in the Notting Hill area of London. He introducedhimself as Manuel, and went on to explain that his father had once worked at theclinic, and had found an envelope containing £3,000 under a pillow. Now the oldman was on his deathbed, and could not rest in peace unless the money wasrestored . . . He waved a fat envelope under Maria’s nose.Maria said she knew of no such clinic, although she had been familiar withNotting Hill for many years. As they stood talking, Manuel stopped anotherpasser-by and asked him if he knew of the clinic. This passer-by—a youngerman—who also happened to be Portuguese (and was also called Manuel) said he wasunable to help, but he joined in the conversation. And as he introduced himselfand took her hand, Maria experienced a strange cold feeling, and feltdisoriented. And as she stood talking, she began to experience a dreamlike senseof unreality, a kind of amnesia.The newcomer now told her to go home, collect her jewellery and her buildingsociety savings book, and go and draw out all her savings. She did as she wastold, and returned to Notting Hill Gate, where the two men were waiting. (Shehad, in the meantime, spoken to her husband on the telephone and beenuncharacteristically rude, hanging up on him.) They now asked her to go to thepost office to buy a stamp, and told her they would hold her handbag. They were,of course, gone when she returned. She had lost a total of £1,141.The swindlers were caught by accident. A Portuguese hairdresser happened tooverhear one of her customers telephoning someone and agreeing to cash a chequeand hand over £8,000. The hairdresser had heard of the two swindlers, and shepersuaded the woman to tell her why she was about to give away such a large sumof money. Her story proved to be almost identical to Maria’s. The police werenotified, and arrested the two Manuels as the money was being handed over. Itemerged subsequently that another victim had given them £1,500, while yetanother had handed over his life’s savings of £6,000. The swindlers were eachsentenced to eighteen months in prison and deported back to Portugal.Here it seems clear that the younger of the two swindlers—his name proved to beManuel de Matos Amaro—was the hypnotist; the role of the elder was merely tolull her into a state of trust. (The fat envelope later proved to be stuffedwith a wad of newspaper.) But it seems clear that here, once again, thehypnotist induced a ‘trance’ merely by touching her hand.Temple goes on to demolish the notion that (a) people cannot be hypnotisedagainst their will, and (b) that people under hypnosis will not commit acts thatthey would not commit in their normal state—he cites many cases of people whohave been prepared to commit crimes or acts of violence under hypnosis. And achapter on rape discusses once more the question raised by the Heidelberg case:whether a woman who is raped under hypnosis is really submitting because shesecretly wants to. In a case cited by Magnus Hirschfeld, this is obviously so:‘A good many years ago I was consulted in a case where a doctor had assaulted awoman patient while she was in a hypnotic state—many such occurrences arerecorded in scientific literature. The patient was a married woman who sufferedfrom weak nerves, irritability, and hysterical “spasms.” As is the case withmany hysterical women, she had unlimited confidence in her doctor, who hadcommenced a course of hypnotism for various neuralgic complaints, heartburn, andinsomnia. The patient was an excellent subject for hypnosis. It was sufficientfor the doctor to lower his upraised hand for the woman to shut her eyesimmediately. At the court hearing of the action, instituted against the doctorby the husband, the doctor made a full confession and described the suggestionshe made and to which the woman automatically yielded, as follows: He ordered herto raise her skirt, lie down, spread her legs, take out his penis, introduce itinto her vagina, then, during the act, perform parallel movements until mutualorgasm occurred, which in her case took place in the same way as in the wakingstate. The woman became pregnant. The impotent husband, who had long suspectedthe doctor, engaged a detective who was able to prove his suspicions. The doctoralleged that he had used the woman for therapeutic reasons. She had, he said, anunhappy life with her husband, and her depression had finally become so intensethat she decided to kill herself; sexual intercourse with him had cured her bothphysically and mentally. He was rewarded for his “therapeutic conscientiousness”with one year in prison.’In this case, it is clear that the woman herself was a more-or-less willingparticipant, and that the induction of hypnotic trance was intended to allow herto feel totally guiltless.On the other hand, a case cited by Erik Hoencamp clearly involves more than agame of make-believe:‘He said I should not be afraid of him and kept talking to me. While he wassaying that, he started to caress my lower body in the area of my genitals. Ijust let that happen, did not feel like, nor had the power to say no. He askedme if I liked it. Although I did not like it, I said yes. Only I did not haveany fear which normally would have been there.‘Then he started to rub my breasts. He told me I should not be scared and hekept going and pulled up my bra and caressed my bare breasts. At the end of thesession we made a new appointment. When the time of the appointment came near, Istill trusted him, hoping that he would not touch me in that way.‘He started as usual again, but talked directly to me. I felt heavy, like theother time. He told me that I would like to unbutton my blouse and pants. Ididn’t do it, but then he said that I would like to prove and show that thefirst treatment sessions really had helped me. He caressed my breast again andafter a while pulled down my pants and panties and he even put his hand in myvagina. I heard him say “You will go deeper and deeper and become more excited.”I just said yes to everything, he kept on going and wanted me to take hisgenitals in my hands. I said no, I would rather not, I’m scared. I was veryscared. After a while I held his penis, he caressed me and rubbed his lower bodyagainst the inside of my legs. He said I had to go on. I would have liked tohave knocked him away, but one way or another I couldn’t do it. I felt as if Iwas paralyzed and was very scared. He kept saying to me, you will go deeper anddeeper. He started to get closer with his genitals, I started to panic andcried.’It seems here very clear that the girl had no basic wish to submit.In another case cited by Temple, a girl met a man on a train, and he touched herforehead and blew into her ears. When they met by chance on another train twoweeks later, he repeated this behaviour, then went to the girl’s room and madelove to her. She wanted to resist, but felt powerless. The next day she feltthat she had been forced against her will, and went to the police to report it.But if the girl was wide-awake, could she really be made to do something againsther will? Temple describes one of his own experiences that helps to explain howthis is possible.‘Moving about while in a trance is a strange experience, and I have done it oncemyself. Having been hypnotized several times by my medical doctor, there was oneoccasion when I left his office while still hypnotized. He hypnotizes patientsafter hours, and on this occasion we had taken rather a long time over it and Icould sense that he was becoming very anxious to get home to see his wife aboutsome matter which had arisen. I worried about detaining him, and so when hecounted me out of the trance and I did not awaken, I did nevertheless open myeyes and simulate being awake in order to fool him. This is an ironical twist,for it is usually the other way round in hypnosis: people simulate beinghypnotized when they are still awake. In my case, the tables were turned. Hescrutinized me and I convinced him I was out of the trance. We then partedcompany and I joined my wife, who always waited for me because I didn’t trustmyself driving after hypnosis. When we got into the car I confessed to her thatI was not really awakened from the trance, and told her to blow on my face. Thisis generally a foolproof way to waken some one. But it did not work, partlybecause my wife found it a ridiculous thing to do and could not help laughing.The more sternly I insisted that she blow on my face, the more uncontrollabledid her mirth become. She found it impossible to believe I was still hypnotized.We began to drive home and after a time I ordered her to stop. I had seen abeautiful old tree and, being very fond of old trees, and being very emotionalwhile in the trance, I got out of the car and ran across a field to see thetree. I embraced the trunk and sobbed, telling the tree how beautiful it was,and crying generally at the beauty of everything in the world in the way amaudlin drunk might do. I then reeled backwards and fell flat on my back on thegrass. I remember looking dreamily up at the night sky and admiring its beautyand uttering maudlin remarks about the grandeur of the cosmos. By this time mywife had caught up with me and helped me to my feet, and she dragged me back tothe car. I kept insisting, “Blow in my face! Blow in my face!” This time she didso earnestly, but it didn’t work. I then mumbled to her that in extremecircumstances like this there was only one sure-fire method to wake me up, andthat was to take me home and give me some neat gin. (I should add that I hateneat gin, and this was not a ploy!) That was precisely what happened: momentsafter I drank the neat gin I woke up from the trance completely.’This fascinating instance provides an important insight into hypnosis. It isclear that, in a certain sense, Temple was ‘drunk’. He was wide-awake, and yetaware that he had not achieved the normal level of focused attention thatcharacterises the waking state. It was as if a certain level of his beingremained asleep. It becomes possible to see how a girl could be wide-awake andyet feel powerless to resist the hypnotist’s orders.Now according to the suggestion theory, hypnosis is merely a matter of inducinga certain kind of ‘self-consciousness’—the kind that causes teenagers to blush.Temple tells a story of a girl who was told that she would forget thecombination of the safe while she was actually turning the dial. She was unableto recall it until the suggestion was discontinued. What happened is clear. Atthe suggestion that she might not be able to remember, she began to doubtherself, and went into a state of confusion that prevented her from recallingthe combination.This is certainly a plausible theory of how hypnotism works—yet it obviouslyfails to explain how hypnosis could be induced merely by a squeeze of the hand.The alternative view—suggested by the experiments of Puységur—is that hypnosisinvolves some kind of telepathic contact or ‘thought pressure’. The writerJ.B.Priestley has a story that seems to support this. In Outcries and Asides,under the title ‘True Strange Story’, he tells how he attended a Poetry Societybanquet in New York. Priestley remarked to his neighbour and he admits he has noidea why he did so—‘I propose to make one of those poets wink at me, and I’lltry the fifth one from the left, that dark heavy-set sombre woman, obviously nowinker.’ ‘After concentrating on her for a minute or two, it seemed to me thatshe winked at me, and I cried triumphantly, ‘She did it . . .’ But my neighbourdid not believe me, and I really was not sure myself . . . However, after thespeeches and awards had been made . . . the dark, sombre woman poet . . . cameup to me. ‘You’re Mr Priestley, aren’t you? Well I must apologise for winking atyou. I’ve never done such a thing before and I can’t imagine what made me do itthen. Just a silly sudden impulse . . .’Again, according to Psi; Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain by LynnSchroeder and Sheila Ostrander, the Polish ‘mind reader’ Wolf Messing had evengreater abilities in this direction. Forced to flee to Russia at the beginningof the Second World War because he had predicted Hitler’s death if the dictator‘turned towards the East’, Messing captured the interest of Joseph Stalin, whoordered a series of experiments. In the first of these, Messing walked into thebank, presented the teller with a ‘note’ (actually a blank sheet of paper), andasked for 10,000 roubles. The cashier handed these over, and Messing packed theminto his briefcase and left. Then, with the two observers who had witnessed theexperiment, he re-entered the bank and handed back the money. The cashiercollapsed with a heart attack when he realised what he had done.The supreme test set by Stalin was to enter his country-house—bristling withguards—without a pass. And one day, as Stalin sat working in his office, Messingwalked coolly into the grounds and into the house. The guards and servants stoodback respectfully. Stalin looked up with astonishment as Messing walked into hisroom. The mind reader explained that he had simply sent out a mental suggestionthat he was Lavrenti Beria, the much-feared head of the secret police, and theguards had actually seen him as Beria.But long before Messing was born, the part played by telepathy in hypnosis hadbeen demonstrated beyond all doubt in 1885 by a French doctor, J.H.A. Gibert,who invited the eminent psychologist Pierre Janet to Le Havre to witness some ofhis experiments. Janet had a patient called Leonie, a peasant woman who was anexample of the condition known as multiple personality (which we shall study ina later chapter). Leonie was normally rather dull and stolid, but during herattacks of ‘somnambulism’ (to which she had been subject since childhood) shebecame a completely different person, lively, gay and sarcastic. This secondarypersonality denied that she was Leonie, whom she regarded with some contempt.Finally, a third personality emerged, who was more mature and balanced thaneither of the others.Leonie was easy to hypnotise—Gibert could do it simply by touching her hand.What interested Janet was that if Gibert tried to do this without concentrating,it did not work. Eventually, Gibert was able to hypnotise Leonie solely byconcentrating his mind—he could even do so when she was on the other side of LeHavre. Several scientists came to Le Havre to observe these experiments,including Frederic Myers, one of the founders of the Society for PsychicalResearch. On one occasion they witnessed Gibert standing outside the house whereLeonie was staying, mentally ordering her to appear. Three minutes later shecame out, and walked across the town to Gibert’s house.On the same evening, Gibert sent out a suggestion that Leonie should go downinto the drawing-room of the house, where she was staying, at eleven o’clock thenext morning, and open a photograph album. The doctors were watching in thegarden at eleven when Leonie came into the drawing-room. She seemed confused,and touched several objects. Then she opened the photograph album, and waslooking through it when the doctors entered the room.Janet’s paper describing all this caused a sensation in the following year, butwas quickly forgotten; it failed to fit into the ‘scientific’ theories of thetime, which were dominated by Charcot’s ‘hysteria’ theory of hypnosis. But inAmerica at about this time, another investigator was pursuing the mystery ofhypnosis with total indifference to what the scientists thought. His name wasThomson Jay Hudson, and he was a Detroit newspaper editor and an official of thePatent Office.Hudson’s interest began as a result of a lecture he attended in Washington D.C.;it was given by the eminent physiologist William B. Carpenter. The audience of‘highly cultivated ladies and gentlemen’ included a young college graduate towhom Hudson refers as C.C. was placed under hypnosis, then asked by Carpenter if he would like to meetSocrates. He replied that he would esteem it a great privilege if Socrates werestill alive. Carpenter explained that he had the power to invoke the spirit ofSocrates, and pointing to a corner of the room exclaimed, ‘There he is.’ C.looked at the place indicated, and his face took on an expression of awe andreverence. Carpenter performed the introductions, and C. looked speechless withembarrassment, although he still retained his wits enough to offer Socrates achair. Carpenter then explained that Socrates was willing to answer anyquestions, and C. proceeded with some hesitation to open a conversation. SinceCarpenter had explained that he was unable to overhear the philosopher’sreplies, C. acted as intermediary and repeated everything Socrates said. For twohours this amazing ‘conversation’ continued, and the answers were so brilliantand plausible that some of the audience began to wonder whether there really wasan invisible spirit in the room.Later Carpenter offered to introduce C. to the spirits of more modernphilosophers, and with most of these he felt a great deal more at ease than withSocrates. What emerged from these conversations was a ‘wonderful system ofspiritual philosophy . . . so clear, so plausible, so perfectly consistent withitself and the known laws of Nature that the company sat spellbound.’ With eachnew philosopher C.’s manner changed, exactly as if he were speaking to a seriesof real people, and the language and style of the invisible philosophers changedtoo: it was all so weirdly real that the audience felt as if they were watchinga play.Hudson watched the demonstrations with baffled amazement. Hudson knew that C.was a total sceptic on the question of ‘spirits’—as was Hudson himself. Underhypnosis he accepted the existence of the spirits of the great philosophersbecause he could obviously see them. What seemed most surprising was that the‘spiritual philosophy’ expressed was not that of C. himself—he frequentlyexpressed his astonishment at some of the statements of the dead philosophers.Yet the whole philosophy was such a coherent system that according to Hudson, itcould have been printed in a book verbatim and would have ‘formed one of thegrandest and most coherent systems of spiritual philosophy ever conceived by thebrain of man’.There happened to be a number of spiritualists present in the audience, and manyof them were inclined to the hypothesis that real spirits were present, untilCarpenter disillusioned them by summoning up the spirit of a philosophical pigwhich discoursed learnedly on the subject of the Hindu doctrine ofreincarnation.Hudson explained these extraordinary powers by suggesting that human beingspossess two minds, which he calls the subjective and the objective mind. The‘objective mind’ is the part of us that deals with everyday life and copes withpractical matters; the subjective mind is concerned with our inner powers andenergies. It is as if the mind had two faces; one turned towards the outsideworld, the other turned towards the inner worlds of memory and intuition. Forpractical purposes they are rather like a husband and wife; the husband—theobjective mind—assertive and aggressive, the wife shy and taciturn, inclined todoubt her own judgement in the face of her husband’s superior forcefulness.Under hypnosis, the husband is put to sleep, and the wife, no longer tongue-tiedwith self-doubt, can exercise her powers of intuition without fear of criticism.As a result, she can perform far more considerable feats than when herdomineering partner is awake. She seems to have remarkable powers over the body,so that a man under hypnosis can not only have a tooth extracted without pain,but will even obey an order not to bleed. He becomes capable of feats ofstrength that would be impossible if he were awake—an old favourite of stagehypnotists is to tell a man that he is about to become as stiff as a board, thenmake him lie between two chairs while someone jumps up and down on his stomach.Hudson is fascinated by these powers of the subjective mind. He cites a case ofan illiterate girl who, when in a fever, began to speak Greek, Latin and Hebrew.A young doctor was so intrigued by this that he investigated the girl’s pastlife, and discovered that, at the age of 9, she had lived with a Protestantpastor who used to walk around the house reading aloud in these languages.Consciously, the girl had not assimilated a single word; but some hidden taperecorded in the brain had preserved everything.Hudson discusses the mystery of calculating prodigies—usually young boys of noparticular talent or intelligence who can perform astonishing feats ofcalculation within seconds—like 5-year-old Zerah Colburn, who once snapped outthe answer to the square root of 106,929 before the questioner had finishedspeaking. He also discusses the curious power of ‘eidetic imagery’—and describesan artist friend who could conjure up a scene at will and then see it projectedin detail on a blank canvas.Genius, says Hudson, is simply a perfect balance between the objective andsubjective minds—as if a husband and wife are in such deep sympathy that thewife has lost all her shyness and pours out her intuitions in the certainty thatthey will be understood. When this happens, the subjective mind can actuallytake over, and the result is known as inspiration, a spontaneous outpouring ofinsights. Hudson cites the example of the great political orator Henry Clay, whowas once called upon to answer an opponent in the Senate when he was feelingsick and exhausted. Clay asked the man sitting next to him to tug on hiscoat-tails when he had been speaking for ten minutes. Two hours later, after amagnificent speech, Clay sank down exhausted, and asked his friend reproachfullywhy he had failed to interrupt. In fact, the friend had not only tugged hiscoat-tails; he had nudged and pinched him, and even jabbed a pin deep into hisleg. This aspect of the ‘subjective mind’ seems to be what the Spaniards callthe duende, the ‘demon’ that sometimes takes over great singers or dancers sothey seem to be possessed by a force greater than themselves. They are, in fact,‘greater than themselves’, for the ego—as we have seen—is a left-brain entity.Yet the limitations of the subjective mind are as odd as its talents. Hudsonobserved that it can reason deductively—from the general to the particular—butnot vice versa. Induction is the ability to leap from a collection of facts tothe laws underlying them. The subjective mind can be shown any number of treeswithout noticing that they add up to a wood. It leaves ‘leaping to conclusions’to its more enterprising and aggressive partner. In fact, the subjective mind isoddly short-sighted and passive. This also explains why it tends to be bad atargument, which involves selecting and reasoning—making choices. Right-brainpeople—‘subjective-minders’—usually become tongue-tied when someone tells themsomething in an authoritative voice, even when they can see it is nonsense; theyfind it hard to put their perceptions into words. This also explains, saysHudson, why psychic powers often evaporate when confronted with scepticism. Thesubjective mind is intensely suggestive, so a mere hint that it is a fraud turnsit into a nervous wreck. Hudson cites the case of a clairvoyant named Bishop,who demonstrated again and again his power to read people’s minds and decipherthe contents of sealed envelopes. But when the well-known journalist HenryLabouchere denounced him as a fake, and challenged him to read the number of abank note sealed in an envelope, he failed miserably. He had done the same thingsuccessfully a thousand times; but the aggressive self-confidence of aleft-brainer was enough to shatter his self-confidence and paralyze the powersof the subjective mind.This brings us to what Hudson considered the most important thing about thesubjective mind: that it is responsible for all so-called psychicphenomena—including ghosts and poltergeists. This suggestion naturallyinfuriated the spiritualists; but Hudson argued his case with impressive skilland conviction. He points out that a hypnotist can induce a blister in a goodhypnotic subject by suggesting that he had been burnt by a hot iron, and arguesconvincingly that the stigmata of the saints—bleeding nail holes and wounds—canbe explained in the same way. He discusses some of the remarkable cures thathave been brought about by hypnosis, and concludes that the subjective mind hasimmense healing powers. In fact, he became convinced that the miracles of theNew Testament were a manifestation of these powers. By way of testing thishypothesis, he decided to try to cure a relative who suffered from rheumatismand nervous convulsions. The method, apparently, was to persuade his ownsubjective mind that it could be done, even though the relative lived a thousandmiles away. He informed two friends that he intended to begin the treatment—sothat they could bear witness if it worked—and started on May 15, 1890. Hedecided to try to communicate the healing suggestions by an effort of will justas he was on the point of going to sleep. Some months later, one of the two‘witnesses’ met the relative, whose health had improved remarkably; theimprovement had started, he said, in mid-May. Hudson claimed that he and closeassociates had made more than a hundred similar experiments, and that not one ofthem had been a failure.Hudson explained these theories in a book called The Law of Psychic Phenomena,which appeared in 1893 and became an immediate bestseller—by 1925 it had gonethrough forty-seven printings. It was Hudson’s sheer bad luck that, within tenyears of its publication, Sigmund Freud’s theory of the unconscious mind hadbecome even more celebrated.Just before the outbreak of the First World War, the Belgian dramatist MauriceMaeterlinck made another highly creditable attempt to explain the nature andorigin of man’s ‘hidden powers’; the title of his book, The Unknown Guest, is athree-word summary of his answer. Inside every one of us, says Maeterlinck,there is an unknown entity that lives ‘in a sort of invisible and perhapseternal palace, like a casual guest, dropped in from another planet, whoseinterests, habits, ideas, passions, have nothing in common with ours’. In fact,the ‘unknown guest’ is a kind of ‘second self—like Hudson’s subjective mind.Maeterlinck recognised that the ‘unknown guest’ is not only responsible fortelepathy and premonitions of danger, but for such inexplicable powers asprecognition of the future. He cites the case of the wife of the Russian generalToutschkoff, who woke up one night dreaming that she was at an inn in an unknowntown, and that her father came into the room to tell her: ‘Your husband has beenkilled at Borodino.’ When the dream had been repeated a third time, she woke herhusband to ask: ‘Where is Borodino?’ He had no idea, and they had to look it upon a map. But later that year, Napoleon invaded Russia, and her husband waskilled at Borodino. Her father came into the room, just as in the dream, to tellher the news.Now in fact modern scientific research has placed this notion of ‘the unknownguest’ on a scientific basis.For some reason that no physiologist yet understands, human beings have twobrains. Or rather, the brain they possess is ‘double’—almost as if a mirror hadbeen placed down the middle, so that one half reflects the other. We seem tohave two hearing centres, two visual centres, two muscle-control centres, eventwo memories. Why this should be so is baffling—one guess being that one of thebrains is a ‘spare’ in case the other gets damaged. What seems even odder isthat the left half of the brain controls the right side of the body, and viceversa.From our point of view, the most interesting part of the brain is the bit at thetop—the cerebral cortex. This is the most specifically human part; it hasdeveloped at an incredible speed over the past million or so years—so fast (ingeological time) that some scientists like to speak of ‘the brain explosion’.If you could lift off the top of the skull and look down on the cerebral cortex,you would see something resembling a walnut, with two wrinkled halves. Thebridge between them is a mass of nerve fibres called the corpus callosum orcommissure.This mass of millions of nerve fibres is obviously important. Which is why brainspecialists were puzzled when they came across freaks who possessed nocommissure, and appeared to function perfectly well without it. In the 1930s,brain surgeons wondered if they could prevent epileptic attacks by severing thecorpus callosum, and so preventing the spread of the ‘electrical storm’ from onehemisphere to the other. They tried severing the commissure in monkeys and itseemed to do no harm. So they tried it on epileptic patients, and it seemed towork. The fits were greatly reduced—and the patient seemed much the same asbefore. One scientist remarked ironically that the only purpose of thecommissure appeared to be to transmit epileptic seizures. Another suggested thatit might be to prevent the brain from sagging in the middle.In 1950, Roger W. Sperry, of the University of Chicago (and later of Cal Tech)began investigating the problem. He discovered that severing the commissureappeared to have no noticeable effect on cats and monkeys. But it would preventone half of the brain learning what the other half knew. So if a cat was taughtsome trick with one eye covered up, and then asked to do it with the other eyecovered, it was baffled. It could even be taught two different solutions to thesame problem (say, pressing a lever to get food) with each side of the brain.There could be no doubt about it; we literally have two brains.Sperry and his associate Michael Gazzaniga then studied a human patient whosebrain had been split to prevent epileptic attacks. He seemed to be perfectlynormal, except for one oddity—which they expected anyway. He could read with hisright eye, but not with his left. It had been known since the 19th century that,in human beings, the two halves of the brain seem to have different functions:‘right for recognition, left for language’. People who had damage to the rightcerebral hemisphere were unable to recognise simple patterns, or enjoy music,but they could still speak normally. People with left-brain damage were able torecognise patterns, but their speech was impaired. Obviously, then, the leftdeals with language, and you would expect a split-brain patient to be unable toread with his right eye (connected, remember, to the opposite side of thebrain). Sperry’s patient was also unable to write anything meaningful (i.e.complicated) with his left hand.They noticed another oddity. If the patient bumped into something with his leftside, he did not notice. And the implications here were very odd indeed. Notonly did the split-brain operation give the patient two separate minds; it alsoseemed to restrict his identity, or ego, to the left side. When they placed anobject in his left hand, and asked him what he was holding, he had no idea.Further experiments underlined the point. If a split-brain patient is shown twodifferent symbols—say a circle and a square—with each eye, and is asked to saywhat he has just seen, he replies ‘A square’. Asked to draw with his left handwhat he has seen, and he draws a circle. Asked what he has just drawn, hereplies: ‘A square’. And when one split-brain patient was shown a picture of anude male with the right-brain, she blushed; asked why she was blushing, shereplied truthfully: ‘I don’t know.’One ‘split-brain’ patient tried to hit his wife with one hand while the otherdefended her. Another tried to unzip his flies with one hand while the othertried to do them up. A patient who was given some wooden blocks to arrange intoa pattern tried to do it with his right hand, and the left hand continuallytried to interrupt him; finally, he had to sit on his left hand to make itbehave.The implications are clearly staggering. The person you call ‘you’ lives in theleft cerebral hemisphere. This is the half of the cerebrum that deals withlanguage and logic. It could be regarded as a scientist. The right half seems towork in terms of patterns and insights; it is basically an artist. And it seemsto be a ‘second self’. It was natural for the patient to try to solve the woodenblock pattern with his right hand (connected to the left brain), because thedoctor had asked him to do the puzzle, and the conscious, everyday self lives inthe left brain. If he had not been a split-brain patient, the right brain wouldhave quietly helped him to solve the puzzle by ‘putting ideas into his head’,and he would not even have been aware of it.So what is it like to be a split-brain patient? The unexpected answer is thatmost of them do not even notice it. And if we reflect for a moment, we can seethat this makes sense. If I try to solve some puzzle—say a Rubik cube—after afew glasses of alcohol, my ‘insight’ refuses to function. This is becausealcohol seems to interfere with the connection between right and left. It has,in fact, given me a kind of instant split-brain operation. Yet I hardly noticethis. My conscious self is so accustomed to coping with reality that it hardlynotices when the ‘other self withdraws its help. But if I attempted to writethis book after several glasses of alcohol—or when I was so tired that the ‘twoselves’ had lost contact—I would instantly realize that something was wrong. Forwriting is an act of close co-operation between the two selves. The right takesa ‘bird’s eye view’, surveying all the possibilities; the left chooses betweenthem and decides which of them to turn into words. If the right fails to do itshalf of the job, the left stares blankly at the sheet of paper and wonders whatto say.Is the right cerebral hemisphere ‘the unknown guest’? That might be going toofar. We still know so little about the brain and its working that it would bebetter to preserve an open mind. But we can safely say that the right hemisphereis the entrance to the ‘invisible palace’ of the unknown guest.There is another point of vital importance to be made. All mental illness iscaused by the conflict between ‘the two selves’. The left ego is the master ofconsciousness, the right is the master of the unconscious. And the relationbetween the two is not unlike the relation between Laurel and Hardy in the oldmovies. Ollie is the left-brain, the boss. Stan takes his cues from Ollie. WhenOllie is in a good mood, Stan is delighted. When Ollie is depressed, Stan isplunged into the depths of gloom. Stan is inclined to over-react.When Ollie wakes up on a wet Monday morning, he thinks: ‘Damn, it’s raining, andI’ve got a particularly dreary day in front of me . . .’ Stan overhears this andsinks into depression. And—since he controls the energy supply—Ollie has that‘sinking feeling’, and feels drained of energy. This makes him feel worse thanever. As he walks out of the gate he bumps into a man who tells him to lookwhere he’s going, then trips over a crack in the pavement, then misses a busjust as he arrives at the stop, and thinks: ‘This is going to be one of thosedays . . .’ And again, Stan overhears, and feels worse than ever. And once more,Ollie feels that sinking feeling. By the end of the day, he may be feelingsuicidal—not because things have been really bad, but because of a continual‘negative feedback’ of gloom between the right and left.Consider, on the other hand, what happens to a child on Christmas Day. He wakesup full of pleasurable anticipation; Stan instantly sends up a flood of energy.When he goes downstairs, everything reinforces the feeling of delight—Christmascarols on the radio, the Christmas tree with its lights, the smell of mince piesin the oven. Each new stimulus causes a new rush of delight; each new rush ofdelight deepens the feeling that ‘all is well’, and that the world is awonderful and exciting place after all.What, then, is hypnosis? The first thing we have to recognise is that allcreatures are, to a large extent, machines. The body is an elaborate machine; sois the brain. But a machine can be operated by anyone who has access to it andknows how it works. It seems fairly obvious that the hypnotist somehow puts theleft brain—Ollie—to sleep, and gains direct access to Stan. And Stan can makethe machine do some remarkable things. If the hypnotist tells him that he willbecome as stiff as a board, and will lie on two chairs, with his head on one andhis heels on the other, while a heavy man jumps up and down on his stomach, hewill do it without hesitation.Which raises an interesting question: if Stan possesses these powers, why willhe not exercise them when Ollie tells him to do so? The answer is that he knowsOllie too well, and does not trust him as he trusts the hypnotist. Yet it shouldalso be obvious that if we could somehow persuade Stan to trust Ollie, we wouldgain access to all the ‘hidden powers’ that Stan controls. And man wouldsuddenly become a kind of superman. This is why it is so important for us tounderstand the basic mechanisms of hypnosis . . .Robert Temple’s story about how he wanted to embrace a tree reminds us that mostof us spend a great deal of time in a semi-hypnotised condition. Our ‘everydayconsciousness’ is only half-awake. It becomes fully awake only when we are fullof excitement or sense of purpose. (Doctor Johnson said: ‘When a man knows he isto be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully.’) As soon asour attention begins to flag, we sink into a kind of light hypnosis. And whenour minds ‘go blank’, we are virtually in a trance.All this was known long before Mesmer. In 1636, a mathematician called DanielSchwenter observed that if a small bent piece of wood is fastened on a hen’sbeak, the hen fixes its eyes on it and goes into a trance. Similarly, if thehen’s beak is held against the ground and a chalk line is drawn away from thepoint of its beak, it lies immobilized. Ten years later, a Jesuit priest, FrAthanasius Kircher, described similar experiments on hens. All that is necessaryis to tuck the hen’s head under its wing and then give it a few gentle swingsthrough the air; it will then lie still. (French peasants still use this methodwhen they buy live hens in the market.) A doctor named Golsch discovered thatfrogs can be hypnotized by turning them on their backs and lightly tapping thestomach with the finger. Snapping the fingers above the frog is just aseffective. Crabs can be hypnotized by gently stroking the shell from head totail, and unhypnotized by reversing the motion. In Hypnosis of Men and Animals(published in 1963), Ferenc András Völgyesi describes how Africans hypnotizewild elephants. The elephant is chained to a tree, where it thrashes aboutsavagely. The natives then wave leafy boughs to and fro in front of it and chantmonotonously; eventually, its eyes blink, close, and the elephant becomesdocile. It can then be teamed with a trained elephant and worked into varioustasks. If it becomes unmanageable, the treatment is repeated, and usually worksalmost immediately.Nothing in all this contradicts the Freudian ‘suggestion’ theory of hypnosis.But Völgyesi also discusses the way that snakes ‘fascinate’ their victims. Farfrom being an old wives’ tale, this has been observed by many scientists. Toads,frogs, rabbits and other creatures can be ‘transfixed’ by the snake’s gaze—whichinvolves expansion of its pupils—and by its hiss. But Völgyesi observed—andphotographed—a large toad winning a ‘battle of hypnosis’ with a snake. Völgyesiobserved two lizards confronting each other for about ten minutes, both quiterigid; then one slowly and deliberately ate the other, starting at the head. Itwas again, apparently, a battle of hypnosis. What seems to happen in such casesis that one creature subdues the will of the other. Völgyesi observed thathypnosis can also be effected by a sudden shock—by grabbing a bird violently, ormaking a loud noise. He observes penetratingly that hypnosis seems to havesomething in common with stage fright—that is, so much adrenalin is releasedinto the bloodstream that, instead of stimulating the creature, it virtuallyparalyses it. (We have all had the experience of feeling weakened by fear.)All this supports the observations made by Puységur, Gibert, Messing andHammerschlag: that hypnosis often involves a ‘beam of will’ directed from oneperson to another.And now, at last, we can see the basic obstacle that separates us from our‘hidden powers’. We are unaware that we possess this ‘will-beam’. We are alwaysallowing it to ‘switch off’, so we fall into a passive condition, like a blanktelevision screen. You could compare us to a person with amnesia, who goes outshopping with a wallet full of money, then suddenly ‘goes blank’ and returnshome without his shopping or his wallet. If you had such a person in yourfamily, you would obviously not allow him to go shopping alone. Yet most of usare subject to this kind of amnesia. When we are full of energy, we fulfil ourdaily tasks with a sense of determination and purpose. But as soon as we growtired, the energy switches off, and life seems oddly boring and meaningless. Ifa sudden problem arises, we groan with boredom and feel that it is ‘not worthdoing’. We have, in fact, fallen into a hypnotic condition, exactly likeSchwenter’s hen with the wood on its beak. The ‘hidden will’ switches off; the‘unknown guest’ falls asleep; we become, in effect, robots.If we wish to evolve to the next stage in human development, we must learn tograsp the meaning of the discoveries of Mesmer, Puységur and Maeterlinck. It istrue that the ‘unknown guest’ lives in an invisible palace. But he isnonetheless real. And if we wish to learn to make use of his powers, we musttrain ourselves to recognise his reality as clearly as we recognise the realityof the material world around us."},{"pageContent":"3Visions of the PastPERHAPS THE MOST remarkable of all the now-forgotten explorers of Maeterlinck’s‘invisible palace’ was another American, Joseph Rodes Buchanan, whosediscoveries were, in their way, even more astonishing than those of Mesmer.Buchanan came to believe that every object in the universe has its whole history‘recorded’ on it—rather like a videotape recording—and that the human mind hasthe power to ‘play back’ this recording.But before we proceed any further, let us consider a practical example.In the winter of 1921, a number of people had come together in a room of theMetapsychic Institute—the French version of the Society for PsychicalResearch—in Paris, to test a clairvoyant, Madame De B-. Dr Gustav Geley, aleading French investigator, and director of the Institute, asked someone topass a letter to her. A painter and novelist called Pascal Forthuny grabbed it.‘It can’t be difficult to invent something that applies to anybody!’ He began toimprovise jokingly. ‘Ah yes, I see a crime . . . a murder . . .’ When he hadfinished, Dr Geley said: ‘That letter was from Henri Landru.’ Landru was at thetime on trial for the murder of eleven women—crimes for which he was guillotinedin the following year.No one was very impressed by Forthuny’s performance; after all, Landru’s trailwas the chief news-event of the day, so murder was an obvious topic to come intoForthuny’s mind. Geley’s wife picked up a fan from the table. ‘Let’s see if thatwas just luck. Try this.’Still light-hearted, Forthuny ran his fingers over the fan in a professionalmatter and looked solemnly into space. ‘I have the impression of beingsuffocated. And I hear a name being called: Elisa!’Madame Geley looked at him in stupefaction. The fan had belonged to an old ladywho had died seven years earlier from congestion of the lungs; the companion ofher last days had been called Elisa.Now it was Forthuny’s turn to suspect a joke. But Madame Geley insisted onanother experiment. She handed him an officer’s cane. This time Forthuny lookedserious as he let his fingers stray over it. He began to describe armymanoeuvres, somewhere in the Orient. He spoke of the young French officer whohad owned the cane, of his return to France by sea, and of how the ship wastorpedoed. He went on to say that the officer was rescued, but developed anillness and died two years later. Madame Geley verified that he was right inevery particular.This curious faculty—which so amazed Forthuny—had first been discovered morethan sixty years earlier by Joseph Rodes Buchanan. He had labelled it‘psychometry’.Buchanan was born in Frankfort, Kentucky, on December 11, 1814, three monthsbefore the death of Mesmer (who died on March 5, 1815, at the age of 81). Hisfather was a doctor and an author, and Buchanan was something of an infantprodigy, studying geometry and astronomy at the age of 6, and taking up law whenhe was 12. When his father died in the following year, Buchanan supportedhimself as a printer, then as a schoolteacher. And at some time during histeens, he came upon the theories of Mesmer, and was fascinated by the notionthat the universe is permeated by some ‘magnetic fluid’, and that the stars andthe planets cause ‘tides’ in this fluid. As we have seen, Mesmer believed thatthese ‘tides’ cause sickness and health in human beings, for we are also full ofa kind of magnetic fluid generated by the nerves. When this fluid becomesblocked or stagnant, we become ill. When it is unblocked—by magnets, or by thedoctor’s own ‘animal magnetism’—we become well again.All this excited the young Buchanan, who was convinced that the world was on thebrink of some tremendous medical discoveries. He recognised, of course, that thesecret of the ‘nerve aura’ lies in the brain, not in the nervous system, for thebrain is its central control box. But in the 1830s, almost nothing was knownabout the anatomy of the brain. What was known was that different parts of thebrain seem to govern our instincts—protectiveness, tenderness, aggression,selfishness, and so on. The great physiologist Joseph Gall discovered the basicstructures of the brain in the late 18th century, and his pupil J. K. Spurzheimwent on to try to locate various areas of the brain that were connected withhuman emotions—destructiveness, love, acquisitiveness, cheerfulness, egotism,and more than twenty others. Spurzheim was convinced that when any of theseareas becomes highly developed it causes a bump on the skull, which can be feltwith the fingertips. The science of these ‘bumps’ was called phrenology, and itsoon became the happy hunting-ground of all kinds of quacks and charlatans.When Buchanan went to study medicine at the University of Louisville in 1835, hewas disappointed to discover that no one seemed to have heard of Gall orSpurzheim. However, he did not allow this to dampen his enthusiasm, and flunghimself into the study of the brain, devising experiments to test theirtheories. Nowadays a man who held his beliefs would be shunned by his colleaguesas a crank; but in that less sophisticated—and less narrow-minded—era, he wassimply regarded as a brilliant young experimenter. He was excited to discoverthat when a patient was hypnotized, he would respond with the appropriateemotion if various ‘bumps’ were gently touched—anger, love, joy, grief and soon. This notion became known as ‘phreno-mesmerism’ and Buchanan claimed to beits discoverer—with some opposition from other followers of Mesmer andSpurzheim. He was only 24 years old when he located what he believed to be the‘region of sensibility’ in the brain. And it was in this region that he laterdecided that the power of psychometry resided.Three years later, Buchanan had a fateful meeting that was to determine thecourse of his whole life. It was with a newly consecrated bishop of theEpiscopal Church named Leonidas Polk, who had abandoned the army in favour ofthe church, and whose diocese included practically the whole of the Americansouth. (He later became a Civil War general, and was killed at Marietta in1864.) The bishop happened to mention casually that he could instantly detectbrass when he touched it—even in the dark—because it produced an offensivemetallic taste in his mouth. Polk allowed Buchanan to feel his ‘bumps,’ andBuchanan was delighted to discover that his region of sensibility—governing thephysical senses—was abnormally developed. (It is important to note thatphrenology—usually dismissed as a pseudo-science—could be astonishinglyaccurate, and that modern science has verified some of its claims.)The bishop was so transparently honest that it never occurred to Buchanan todoubt his word—but neither, apparently, did he ask Polk to submit to scientifictests. Instead, he decided to test others and see whether they might also havethe same highly developed sensibilities. Any one of his students whose headshowed an unusual bump of sensibility was roped in, and Buchanan was gratifiedto discover that this faculty of ‘sensing’ brass through the fingers wasrelatively common. In fact, his subjects could distinguish various metals, andsubstances like sugar, salt, pepper and vinegar.There was nothing very odd about this, as far as Buchanan was concerned. Afterall, the tongue has precisely this power—so why not the finger-ends, which areequally important for sensing objects? Besides, as we have seen in the lastchapter, scientists of the nineteenth century were aware of a power that modernscience has forgotten—that of ‘seeing’ with other parts of the body beside theeyes. This sounds absurd, yet precise descriptions of scientific experimentsleave no doubt that it happened, and that it could still happen. Dr JustinusKerner, whose book The Seeress of Prevorst was a 19th century best-seller,described how the ‘seeress,’ Friederike Hauffe, could read with her stomach; hemade her lie down with closed eyes, placed documents on her bare midriff, andlistened to her reading fluently from them. Later in the century, ProfessorCesare Lombroso, the founder of scientific criminology, carefully tested a girlwho was able to see through the tip of her nose and her left ear, and who couldsmell through her chin and—later—through her heel.1 Modern paranormal researchhas identified people who can ‘see’ colours through their fingertips, but modernscience still regards the case as nonproven. In Buchanan’s day it was regardedas a perfectly normal possibility.Buchanan also observed that people in warm climates could ‘sense’ metals andother substances better than those in cold ones. That was also logical, for inwarm climates, we sweat more, and sweat-dampened skin is more sensitive—forexample, to wind—than a dry skin. This, says Buchanan, is ‘a fact which I nowconsider as well settled and familiar as any other in medical science’. And whenhe imparted this fact to his students, he took care to disarm scepticism by animmediate demonstration. Various chemicals were carefully wrapped in paper, andgiven to the students to hold. Some of the substances were strong stimulants ornarcotics, some emetics, some even cathartics. Out of a class of 86, half thestudents experienced definite effects from the substances they held—some holdingthe emetic had to put it down hastily to avoid being sick. (He does not mentionwhat happened to those holding laxatives.) Buchanan got the 43 who experiencedthese effects to sign a testimonial, which he includes in his book.His next thought was that if a mere substance could affect a ‘sensitive’ sostrongly, then living people would produce an even stronger effect. He selectedhis best sensitives, and asked them to try placing the hand on the head or bodyof another person, then to concentrate on the effect. Again, his sensitivesshowed by their reaction that they were somehow picking up the feelings of theother person. When the hand was placed on the stomach of a person suffering froma disease of that region, a ‘morbid impression’ was produced. Buchanan claimsthat he himself became so good at sensing the diseases of patients in this waythat he would feel ill after a few minutes and have to break the contact.One of Buchanan’s best sensitives was a man named Charles Inman. He couldexperience the mental states of patients by lightly running his fingers overtheir ‘bumps’. But could it have been telepathy? Or even mere auto-suggestion?Buchanan decided to try a simple experiment. He selected from his correspondencefiles four letters written by people with strong characters, and asked Inman ifhe could discover anything about the character of the writers by merely holdingtheir letters. The result, he says, surpassed all his expectations; Inman beganto talk about the letter-writers with as much insight as if he had known thempersonally.Two of the letters were from a surgeon named J. B. Flint and a doctor, CharlesCaldwell, who had founded the college at Louisville. These men had once beenfriends, but had become bitter enemies. Inman immediately sensed their mutualdetestation, and their negative emotions affected him so powerfully that he hadto put the letters down. Buchanan asked him which of the two he thought wouldwin in a conflict; Inman held up Caldwell’s letter and said: ‘This one wouldcrush the other.’ It was, in fact, true—Caldwell’s efforts had resulted in Flintbeing removed from his chair of surgery.One of the other letters was from an eminent politician, and Inman was able tosay that he was a man of considerable mental and physical power. What couldhappen, asked Buchanan, if Dr Caldwell and the politician met in a head-oncollision? Inman shook his head. That would be highly unlikely, he said, becauseboth were too courteous and dignified. Buchanan insisted—suppose the unthinkablehappened and they did clash? Reluctantly, Inman gave his opinion. The two menwould never reach the stage of open hostility, but if some disagreement didbreak out, the politician would probably handle the situation by some tactfulrebuke that would immediately check the doctor. Since Buchanan had seen thatprecise event take place, he was deeply impressed.But what did it all mean? For a ‘sensitive’ to identify a metal or a chemical—oreven someone’s illness—was one thing; but surely to pick up someone’s characterfrom a letter was quite another? Buchanan did not think so. Photography was afairly recent invention—the photographs of the period were known asdaguerreotypes, after the inventor Daguerre. A daguerreotype, Buchanan reasoned,is nothing more or less than a ‘light painting’, a painting made on sensitivechemicals by the light reflected from its subject. Well, human beings seem toemanate ‘nerve aura’, and this seems to vary according to their strength ofcharacter. So why should a sensitive not be able to pick up the nerve aura fromletters?If this reasoning strikes us as specious, it is mainly because Buchanan hasmissed out a step in the argument. A bloodhound can tell the difference betweentwo human beings by the scent on their clothes. Buchanan regarded sensitiveslike Charles Inman as human bloodhounds who can pick up the ‘scent’ of the nerveaura. And if his precise character-readings sound improbable, we have to reflectthat such processes as sound-recording and television transmission seem equallyunlikely. A gramophone record is a series of bumps on a disc of plastic or wax;when a needle travels over these bumps, it reproduces the sounds that originallymade the bumps. But any bright child will immediately raise the question: howcan a few bumps record all the instruments of the orchestra? Surely at leastthere ought to be a separate row of bumps for each instrument? Sound recordingis a preposterous miracle which, in any well-ordered universe, ought not to beallowed to happen. And any scientist in 1842—the year Buchanan performed theseexperiments with Inman—would have stated with certainty that it could nothappen. Buchanan’s nerve aura daguerreotypes are no more or less absurd than along-playing record or compact disc.We may, of course, feel that Buchanan was deceiving himself with his ownenthusiasm and excitement. But reading his careful and precise accounts of hisexperiments, it is hard not to feel that any reasonable person would have foundthem just as exciting and just as convincing. He describes, for example, how hecalled upon a clergyman in Boston, the Rev. Kent, whom he describes as having anactive mind but a feeble constitution. (Many later experimenters discovered thatsick people made the best ‘sensitives’.) Kent thought the whole ideapreposterous, but agreed to co-operate. Buchanan tried handing him a letter thathad been written to him ‘by a gentleman of strong character and ardent emotions,immediately after the death of his wife’. The Rev. Kent described his sensationsin an account of the experiment. After placing his right hand on the foldedletter: ‘I felt nothing in my frame at the moment, but very soon an increasing,unusual heat in the palm of my hand; this was followed by a prickling sensation,commencing in my fingers’ ends and passing gradually over the top of my hand,and up the outside of my arm. I felt for nearly a minute no change in my mentalcondition, and stated this. Dr Buchanan had given no hint of the nature orauthor of any letter he had with him—and I had no bias or subject on my mindfrom the day’s experience to influence me. A rush of sadness, solemnity anddistress suddenly came over me; my thoughts were confused and yet rapid—and Imentioned, there is trouble and sorrow here . . .’Buchanan next handed Mr Kent a letter by General ‘Stonewall’ Jackson, written toBuchanan’s father-in-law during an election campaign ‘in a spirited style’: ‘Myfirst sensations were sharper and stronger than before, passing up in the samemanner from my finger’s ends. In less than a minute my whole arm becameviolently agitated, and I yielded to an irresistible impulse to give utteranceto my thoughts and feelings. A determined, self-confident, daring and triumphantfeeling, suggested the language I used, and it seemed to me that I could havegone on triumphantly to the accomplishment of any purpose, however subtle orstrong might be the opposition to be overcome. My whole frame was shaken, mystrength wrought up to the highest tension, my face and arm burned, and . . .when I retouched the letter, after repeated removals of my hand by Dr B., inconsequence of my great excitement, it was like touching fire, which ran to myvery toes.’We can see why Buchanan, watching the clergyman’s mood change from scepticism tointense excitement, should have been totally convinced. Further experiments—hecarried out literally hundreds in those first two years—deepened his certaintythat he had made one of the major scientific discoveries of the age. In his‘Original Sketch’ of psychometry, written in 1848, he wrote exultantly: ‘If,then, man, in every act, leaves the impression or daguerreotype of his mentalbeing upon the scenes of his life and subjects of his action, we are by this lawfurnished with a new clue to the history of our race; and I think it highlyprobable that, by the application of this principle, the chasms of history maybe supplied, and a glimpse may be obtained of unrecorded ages and nations whoseearly history is lost in darkness. The ancient manuscripts, paintings and otherworks of art . . . are doubtless still instinct with the spirit that producedthem, and capable of revealing to psychometric exploration the living realitieswith which they were once connected. At present these relics are barren ofsignificance. Their hidden meaning lies waiting for the future explorer, as thehieroglyphics of Egypt awaited the arrival of Champollion . . .‘The Past is entombed in the Present! The world is its own enduring monument;and that which is true of its physical, is likewise true of its mental career.The discoveries of psychometry will enable us to explore the history of man, asthose of geology enable us to explore the history of the earth. There are mentalfossils for the psychologist, as well as mineral fossils for the geologist . . .Aye, the mental telescope is now discovered, which may pierce the depths of thepast, and bring us in full view of all the grand and tragic passages of history. . .’It is easy to sympathize with his excitement. He was no mad enthusiast orreligious crank, but a respectable man of science. If he was correct, as he hadnot the slightest doubt that he was, then his name would rank with the greatestdiscoverers and explorers in human history. It was surely impossible that hisfindings could fail to arouse wide interest . . .They did precisely that, as the National Cyclopedia of American Biography tellsus: ‘His lectures and experiments attracted much attention in the United Statesand Europe, and he received many encouraging endorsements from physicians. Buthe realised that the medical profession was then extremely conservative, and hegave up the labours of propagandism and united with other physicians inestablishing, in 1845–46, in Cincinnatti, Ohio, the Eclectic Medical Institute,an institution fundamentally devoted to independent thought and progress. He wasprofessor of physiology in the college in 1846–56, and dean of the faculty in1851–56. He retired from the college in 1856.’Buchanan was fortunate to establish a haven for himself. It would protect himfrom the coming storm—the storm caused by the rise of the movement calledSpiritualism, which made every respectable doctor and scientist in the UnitedStates the sworn enemy of anything that sounded like ‘occultism’. But that is astory that must be told in the next chapter.Meanwhile, before we proceed with the story of psychometry, it is important toconsider an interesting parallel development on the other side of the Atlantic;an idea that, by that revolutionary year 1848, had already made its discovererfamous. It was called the Odic force.Karl Reichenbach was one of those dynamos who seem born for wealth and success.Born in 1788, he had flung himself into the bold and venturesome spirit of theage, and built his first ironworks when he was 26. A sugar-beet factoryfollowed; then there were blast furnaces in Moravia and a steelworks at Ternitzin Austria. He purchased vast estates, including a castle. Turning to the studyof tar derivatives, he discovered paraffin, creosote and a blue aniline dye.He was approaching 50 when his business partner, Count Hugo zu Salm, died, andReichenbach found himself involved in tiresome legal battles with the count’ssons. He won; but the litigation filled him with longing to turn his back on theworld of quarrelsome human beings. When, in 1839, he was created a baron(Freiherr), he decided to retire to his castle at Reisenberg, near Vienna, andplunge into the peace of scientific research. But he was no longer concernedwith organic chemistry. He now felt free to pursue an old dream, which wasconnected with the mysteries of the human mind.When he was in his early 20s, Reichenbach had been excited by the researches ofthe poet Goethe into the nature of light. Goethe had decided that Newton waswrong in believing that white light is made up of the seven colours of thespectrum—a conclusion he reached by looking at a white wall through a prism andobserving that the rainbow colours only appeared around its edges. If whitelight was really multicoloured, why did not the whole wall turn into a rainbow?Goethe decided that colours are created by the mechanism of the eye, pointingout that if you rub your eyes vigorously in the dark, you see vivid flashes ofcolour. Goethe’s results had been dismissed by scientists as muddle-headed; butReichenbach suspected he might be right after all. If so, it would be one moreproof that the human mind is more complex than we think. And it was thispossibility that fascinated Reichenbach.Like most other scientists in Europe in 1839, he was interested in mesmerism andhypnotism (usually known as ‘somnambulism’). It is also certain that he wasaware of a mystery that was still causing speculation all over Europe: that ofthe youth called Caspar Hauser, who had been murdered by an unknown assailant amere seven years earlier. Hauser had first walked into the town of Nuremberg onWhit-Monday 1828, apparently unable to speak a work. His feet were bleeding, andproved to be so white and tender that it was obvious he had never walked onthem. A letter he was carrying, addressed to an army captain, stated that he wasa foundling who wished to serve his king and country. He wrote his name on apiece of paper in crude and childish letters: Caspar Hauser. And it soon becameclear that the unfortunate youth—who seemed to be about sixteen—had spent hiswhole life in darkness, chained to a bed in some unknown dungeon. He had nomemory of who he was; his mind was totally unformed. Yet he proved to beintelligent and, under the tutelage of a local schoolmaster, soon learned tospeak.Because he had been raised under such abnormal conditions, Caspar proved to havean extraordinary sensitivity. His sight and hearing were abnormally acute; hecould see in the dark, and demonstrated his ability by reading aloud from theBible in a completely black room. His sense of smell was so keen that he beganto vomit if coffee, beer or any other strong drink was in the same room. Themere smell of wine literally made him drunk. The static electricity in the airduring a thunderstorm caused him intense suffering. His teacher, Dr Daumer, soondiscovered that Hauser could instantly detect copper or brass as soon as he cameinto a room, even if it had been carefully hidden. Moreover, he coulddistinguish between various metals—exactly like Buchanan’s subjects—simply byholding his hands above the cloth that concealed them.Hauser was also something of a human magnet—another phenomenon that has neverbeen explained by science. Some people can build up such a powerful electriccharge that anyone who touches them receives a severe shock. Hauser was notactually ‘electric’, but he attracted metal, and when he was on a horse, thestirrups stuck to his feet. He responded strongly to magnets; the north polegave him a different sensation from the south pole, and he seemed to perceivedifferent colours at either end.In 1829 an unknown man entered Daumer’s house when Hauser was alone and stabbedhim. He recovered; but in 1832, the same man stabbed him again in the publicgardens, and this time it proved fatal. The criminologist Anselm von Feuerbachpublished a paper in which he argued convincingly that Hauser was a prince ofthe house of Baden, a brother of the queen of Sweden who, for reasons ofpolitical intrigue, had been kept alive by those who were ordered to murder him.(His brothers, Feuerbach maintains, were murdered soon after birth.) Feuerbachwas bitterly attacked for his views—for in those days of petty princelings,royalty was regarded as above criticism—and died soon after Caspar Hauser’smurder. The mystery still remains unsolved.Whether because of the Hauser case, or because of some more general interest inabnormal sensitivity, Reichenbach began to repeat some of Mesmer’s experimentswith magnets—which, according to Mesmer, could cause small tides in theuniversal ether, and move it around the body. Then, in 1844, he heard about agirl named Mary Novotny, daughter of a tax collector in Vienna, who sufferedfrom general debility and cataleptic attacks—like Justinus Kerner’s famouspatient, Friederike Hauffe, ‘the Seeress of Prevorst’. Herr Novotny was asked ifhe would take a large magnet—no doubt supplied by Reichenbach—into hisdaughter’s bedroom in the middle of the night, and see if she responded to it.The results were far more striking than he had expected. Around the poles of themagnet, the girl saw a fiery glow, a kind of aurora borealis, reddish-yellowfrom the south pole and bluish-green from the north. Could this have beenauto-suggestion? Reichenbach got his assistant to go into the next room andpoint the magnet at her through the wall; she immediately detected its presence.Blindfolded, she could tell when the armature was moved from the end of themagnet. And, like Caspar Hauser, Miss Novotny proved to be a kind of magnetherself—at least, her hand stuck to the magnet as if her skin was made of iron.Two months later, Reichenbach heard about another sick girl, Angelica Sturmann.He had, meanwhile, been experimenting with ‘magnetized’ crystals, and found thatthey also affected sensitives. But for his first experiment with Miss Sturmann,he took a large piece of ordinary mountain crystal. He hid this in a dark room,then asked for the girl to be brought in. Within moments she had pointed out thecrystal; she said that it was glowing and emitting sparks, and that a blue lightwas streaming out of its peak. When Reichenbach turned it upside down, she saw akind of red and yellow smoke around the bottom.His tests with sensitives revealed that they enjoyed holding their fingers inthe blue light, which they found cool and pleasant, while the reddish-yellowlight produced a warm, slightly nauseating, sensation. Metals like brass andcopper produced this same unpleasant sensation; so did quicksilver, which seemedto explain why many of his ‘sick sensitives’ could not stand mirrors. When hethrew a spectrum on a wall with a prism, and placed glasses of water in the blueand the yellow light, the sensitives could tell the difference; the ‘blue’ watertasted faintly lemony, the ‘yellow’ bitter and sickly—one sensitive vomitedafter tasting it.His sensitives could also see plants and flowers in the dark—they seemed to besurrounded by a dim light. In fact, so were animals and human beings. And when abell was rung, its vibrations produced a colour which gradually died away. Thelight from human beings was dim and smoky, except around the hands. These hadclear colours streaming from the fingertips—blue from the right hand,yellowy-red from the left. A blindfolded sensitive could tell which hand he wastouching her with according to whether it produced a cool or a warm sensation.‘You see,’ remarks Reichenbach, ‘that a man is polarized from right to left . .. in the same way as a crystal’—anticipating one of the most interestingdiscoveries of modern brain physiology.All this seemed to support Mesmer’s conclusions about animal magnetism; but,oddly enough, Reichenbach disagreed. This was surely not some ‘etheric’ fluidthat pervaded all space, but some mysterious energy that was common to magnets,crystals and living creatures. Reichenbach called this energy ‘Od’ or ‘Odyle’,and it became generally known as the ‘Odic force’.Here it becomes possible to see the error in Reichenbach’s reasoning. Our sensesare all tuned to different kinds of energy; our ears vibrate to sound, our eyesto colour, our skins to warmth. The range of our senses is limited, apparentlyby survival needs; it would be of no particular use to us to be able to see thesun’s ultra-violet rays, or the infra-red radiation from a hot stove. It soundsvery much as if Caspar Hauser’s years in darkness developed his senses to apoint where he could perceive far beyond the normal range, just as some ofReichenbach’s sick sensitives could see the vibration of a bell or a violin.They were not perceiving ‘Od’, but ordinary energy. The force that animatesliving beings seems to have little in common with heat and light, although wenow know that all living creatures generate a weak electric field—which itsdiscoverer, Harold Burr, called the ‘L-field’. Whatever the nature of thislife-force, it is certainly not Reichenbach’s ‘Od’. Reichenbach, like Goethe,had been led astray by his enthusiasm and his desire to find some simple unitingprinciple behind all phenomena. He would have done better to be contented withmultiplicity.Nevertheless, by the year 1848 Reichenbach had achieved European celebrity. His‘Od’ theory was regarded as the latest scientific advance, and most scientistswere willing to preserve an open mind about it—Reichenbach’s descriptions of theprecautions he took against auto-suggestion were so impressive. Others werebeginning to take up his ideas and repeat his experiments. It seems a reasonableassumption that, even if Buchanan had never discovered psychometry, one ofReichenbach’s followers would have done so.In fact, it was a follower of Buchanan who opened up new and exciting vistas inthe study of psychometry.His name was William Denton, and he was an Englishman who had been born inDarlington in 1823, and became a popular lecturer on temperance after hisconversion to Methodism at the age of 16. Seven years later he moved to theUnited States, and went to Cincinnatti, where, oddly enough, he seems to havefailed to encounter Joseph Rodes Buchanan, professor at the newly foundedEclectic Institute. He nevertheless married a Cincinnatti girl, moved on toDayton, Ohio, as a headmaster, and became interested in the latest ideas ingeology. In fact, he embraced what was then the violently controversial ideathat the earth had not been created a few thousand years ago, but many millions.It is recorded that this caused so much offence to orthodox Christians that onone of his lecture trips he was threatened with mob violence. But it was afterhe became Professor of Geology at the University of Boston—in 1853—that he cameupon Buchanan’s idea, published in the Journal of Man. The second issuecontained the remarkable passage about the past being entombed in the present.For a geologist, no idea could be more exciting:‘And why should not the world be filled with the monuments and unwritten recordsof its past history? . . . The geologist finds, in the different strata of theearth, in its curiously mingled and irregular structure, and in the fossilremains which it conceals in its bosom, the history of its various changes ofsurface, and of the antediluvian races of animals which have long been extinct.The huge saurian monsters, which he portrays from their fossil relics, risebefore the eye as incredible chimeras. And over this fertile region, nowoccupied by prosperous States, he revives, by the magic power of science, theantediluvian seas and their strange inhabitants . . .’Denton was carried away by Buchanan’s daguerreotype theory. He also liked anexperiment performed by G. H. Lewes, husband of the novelist George Eliot. Leweslaid a wafer on a surface of polished metal, and breathed on it. Then he allowedhis breath to evaporate, removed the wafer, and breathed on the plate again. Theimage of the wafer appeared on the surface. It was still there months later. Iteven remained there when he carefully brushed the metal surface with a camelhairbrush. Is it not conceivable, Denton reasoned, that nature is full of suchdaguerreotypes of past events?His sister, Anne Cridge, seemed a suitable subject for experiment, since she was‘highly impressible’. Denton began by trying Buchanan’s experiments withletters. Mrs Cridge revealed herself to be an excellent psychometrist: ‘She sawand described the writings of letters he was examining, and their surroundings,telling at times even the colour of hair and eyes correctly.’The next step was to try her with a geological specimen. Denton selected a pieceof limestone which he had picked up near Quindaro, Kansas, on the MissouriRiver; it was full of tiny fossil shells. His sister was not told anything aboutthe specimen, and it was wrapped in paper so she could not tell what it was. Herresponse was:‘It seems to me there is a deep hole here. Oh, what shells! small shells; somany. I see water; it looks like a river running along. What a high hill –almost perpendicular; it seems as if the water had cut it in two; it is not sohigh on the other side. The hill is covered with sand and gravel.’This was an excellent beginning. Denton admitted that, as far as his memoryserved him, it was a very accurate description. ‘This piece of rock had taken inthe pictures of the turbid Missouri that swept past it, the hill that hung overit, and the country in general around it, and, to the eye of the psychometer,they became apparently as plainly visible as to a spectator on the spot’.His wife, Elizabeth Denton, also proved to be a good psychometer. When he handedher a piece of quartz from Panama, she received an impression of a huge insect,with antennae nearly a foot long, resting its head against a quartz rock, andcould see a snake coiled in the wiry grass. She remarked that the country seemedmuch warmer than North America, with tropical vegetation.These experiments were encouraging. But the result of the next was spectacular.He handed his sister a fragment of volcanic lava from Kilauea, on Hawaii,wrapped in paper. Mrs Cridge had an impression of an ocean, with ships sailingon it, and could tell that it was an island. Then she saw ‘an ocean of firepouring over a precipice and boiling as it pours. I see it flow into the ocean,and the water boils intensely’. The vision was so real that it shattered hernerves, and the feeling of fear remained for the next hour. Denton knew that thepiece of lava had, in fact, been ejected in the eruption of 1840, so the visionof ships was probably accurate.At this point, Denton took a precaution which reveals that he was a genuinescientist, determined to rule out all possibility of auto-suggestion. He triedwrapping several specimens in separate sheets of paper, then mixing them up, sohe had no idea which was which. Then he handed his wife one of them. She had avision of a volcano, with molten lava flowing down its side. ‘The specimen mustbe lava’, said Mrs Denton, and she was right.Denton’s precaution seems to us merely common sense. But we have to bear in mindthat, in 1853, telepathy was virtually unknown. The word itself was not eveninvented until 1882 (by F.W.H. Myers, one of the founders of the Society forPsychical Research). Before that, most psychic faculties were bundled vaguelytogether under the general heading of ‘clairvoyance’, which included the abilityto see ghosts, glimpse what was happening elsewhere, and foretell the future.Once the Society for Psychical Research began to investigate telepathy, itbecame clear that it is probably the commonest of psychic faculties. (Mostmarried couples, for example, have had experiences of starting to say the samething at the same time.) Professor Gilbert Murray, a determined rationalist, wasso good at it that he treated it as a party game, leaving the room while thecompany thought up a subject from life or literature, then coming back in andtelling them what they had decided upon. (‘Jane Eyre at school standing on astool and being called a liar by Mr Brocklehurst . . . ‘) By 1949, telepathy wasso widely accepted, even by scientists, that Sir Alister Hardy could say, in hispresidential address to the zoological section of the British Association: ‘Ibelieve that no one who examines the evidence with an unbiased mind can rejectit’—a statement that would have brought catcalls half a century earlier.When we consider many of Buchanan’s experiments, we often feel that the resultscould be explained by telepathy—particularly when the psychometer is his ownwife. With Denton, this is ruled out from the early experiments, since heusually took the precaution of making sure that he himself had no idea what waswrapped in the paper.Denton was understandably elated. ‘From the first dawn of light upon this infantglobe, when round its cradle the steamy curtains hung, to this moment, Naturehas been busy photographing every moment’. It was—and is—a perfectly reasonablehypothesis. We now know that matter and energy are the same thing; matter isfrozen energy. Energy from space—light, heat, cosmic rays—falls upon us in acontinuous cosmic hail, knocking electrons from the surface of everything itstrikes. Light falling on a sheet of metal ‘evaporates’ electrons as sunlightevaporates a sheet of water, producing the ‘photo-electric effect’, an electriccurrent. So there can be no doubt that everything that happens in daylight is‘photographed’ by the surrounding objects. But the ‘film’ is double- and treble-and multiple-exposed, so that even if it could be developed, it would beuseless. In a science fiction novel, Before the Dawn (1934), the mathematicianE. T. Bell invented a ‘light decoder’ that could sort out the various exposuresand then ‘play back’ the resulting record of the ages like a film projector;since then, the invention of the computer has made the notion rather moreplausible, since sorting out the exposures would be largely a matter of computeranalysis. But the human brain is thousands of times more complex than anycomputer; so the assumption of Buchanan and Denton—that the mind has its owninbuilt decoder—is easier to accept today than it was in 1860.Denton went to considerable lengths to rule out self-deception. For example, hewould try the same specimen on the psychometer more than once, with an intervalof weeks in-between, to see whether it produced the same impressions. From afragment of bone obtained from a piece of limestone, Elizabeth Denton’s firstimpression was:‘. . . a long, smooth beach . . . On that beach are quadrupeds of some kind. Oneis large, heavy, thick-skinned, dark coloured and thick necked; the flesh is notfibrous, but soft. Its head is broad, and horns rise up from its nose. I seeanother with a long neck and a head nearly as large as a sheep’s, but inappearance like that of a snake, though it is a quadruped.’This sounds like a plesiosaur, the species to which the fabled Loch Ness monsteris supposed to belong. She was impressed by rocks covered with bright greenmoss.Denton tried the same specimen on her a month later, making sure she had no ideaof what it was (although this time, he took no precaution against telepathy.)Again she saw water, with water weeds that looked like moss; but this time shesaw birdlike creatures with membranous wings in the shallow water. We know thatpterodactyls fed on fish, so it seems conceivable they spent part of their timein the water, like seagulls.On other occasions, Denton himself had no idea of what the psychometrist wasexamining; he would cover the table-top with various minerals and fossils, andthe psychometrist would pick up one of them with closed eyes. When she describedin detail a scene under the sea, the specimen proved to be a piece of Siluriancoral. A tiny fragment of a mastodon’s tooth, so small that it could not berecognized, immediately produced an impression of ‘a perfect monster with heavylegs, unwieldy head, and very large body’. Various fragments of limestoneproduced magnificent and detailed descriptions of prehistoric landscapes. Asmall fragment of chamois horn produced a fine description of the Alps. A fossilfrom Cuba brought a description of a tropical island with some accurategeographical details. A piece of Indian pottery brought an immediate image ofRed Indians. Fragments of meteorites—tried on several psychometrists—alwaysbrought visions of empty space, sometimes of the earth seen from a great height.A pebble from a glacier produced an immediate impression of being frozen in agreat depth of ice. A fragment of rock from Table Rock, Niagara, brought animpression of looking down from a mountain into a ‘deep hole’ with somethingboiling up from it—the psychometrist thought it was a hot spring with steam,although she could hear the noise of a torrent, and see the Niagara River. Laterin the experiment she recognized that ‘the water makes that smoke; it looks likea rain-cloud or mist’. A fragment of stalactite brought a picture of ‘pieces ofrock hanging down; they look like icicles.’When Denton tried his wife with a piece of hornstone brought from the Mount ofOlives, the result was a description of a dry land with low rocky hills, ‘sopoor . . . they could not raise enough to eat’, and horses, sheep and goats. Shethen went on to describe a large church, and a city with a wall and iron gates.Finally, by inference, she guessed she was looking at Jerusalem.On a later occasion, Denton took the same fragment out of a box of mixedspecimens without knowing what it was. Again, there followed a description of awalled city and a barren landscape, with the comment: ‘I think the Bible mighthave been written here’. It was only when she had finished that Denton lookedmore closely at the rock and identified it as the hornstone he had usedpreviously.As the psychics became more skilled, they began to be able to distinguishdifferent periods in the history of the specimens. One of these cases is amongthe most impressive Denton recorded. He handed his sister a fragment of mosaicpavement that had been dug up in 1760 and brought to England. It came from thevilla of the Roman orator Cicero. Denton was hoping for a description ofCicero—or at least, of some ancient Romans. Instead, Mrs Cridge began bydescribing a prehistoric forest with a beast like a mastodon. Denton asked herto come forward to more modern times. Now she saw a country house standing inits own grounds, and an old man in knee-breeches and a swallow-tailed coat. Thissounds like the house to which the fragment had been brought in 1760.Denton decided to try it on his wife. She immediately sensed that hersister-in-law had already psychometrised it. Then she described a garden with acascade which she felt to be landscaped (’there is human influence about this’).She went on to describe a sick-room scene in the house. All this was ratherdisappointing.Some days later, Denton decided to try her again. This time she immediately sawa distinctly Roman scene, with a large building with pillars and steps leadingup to it. In a room with uncomfortable furniture (‘if furniture it can becalled’) the walls were hung with crimson velvet. She saw lines of helmetedsoldiers, then a ‘fleshy man with a broad face and blue eyes’. He wore a ‘dresslike a gown’ (presumably a toga). ‘He is majestic, yet has a good deal ofgeniality about him too. He regards himself as superior, and withdraws fromothers . . . It seems to me that he has something to do with those troops . . .’Cicero had been a successful military commander at one point in his career; buthe was tall and thin. Denton concluded that the man might have been Cicero, andended his notes on the experiment ‘. . . at all events, we have a description inharmony with the time and people of the days of Cicero’.By the time he came to republish the book—with an additional two volumes—in1888, he had made an important discovery. The previous owner of Cicero’s househad been the dictator Sulla, and his wife’s description was altogether closer towhat we know of Sulla (who died in 78 BC). He was one of the few Roman dictatorswho succeeded in dying in his bed. While some of his measures were ruthless andunpopular, he was known as a convivial man who was fond of his friends. Hissoldiers called him ‘lucky Sulla’. Mrs Denton had apparently focused on Sullarather than Cicero—an indication (like Mrs Cridge’s 18th-century garden) thatDenton’s expectations had little or no influence on the psychometers. (In fact,most modern paragnosts would say that if they want to receive telepathicimpressions, then they have to focus on the person whose mind they want to read;if they want psychometric impressions, they concentrate on the object.)When Denton handed his wife a fragment of the Porcelain Tower, near Peking, heknew nothing whatever about it, except that it came from a place called thePorcelain Tower in China. His wife described a place like a temple, with massivewalls and large urns; she saw a bell-shaped roof and a spire. After writing downher description, Denton checked in the Iconographic Encyclopedia to find outwhat the Porcelain Tower was used for (for all he knew, it was simply a monumentlike the leaning tower of Pisa). He discovered that it was a temple, with wallstwelve feet thick.If we can make the assumption that Denton’s own knowledge of the objects had notelepathic influence on the psychometrist, then the experiments he describes inthe first volume of The Soul of Things are stunningly impressive. Again andagain they were able to pin down the place from which the object came. A pieceof a limestone slab from Nineveh brought an impression of a vast temple; a Greekcoin (kept unseen) brought a detailed description of the mint; a piece ofcurtain from the House of Representatives brought a large council chamber, andan impression of some members talking glibly and superficially; a piece ofsandstone from Melrose Abbey in Scotland brought a description of an abbey witharched doorways, Gothic windows and an aisle. Three months later, Mrs Denton washanded the fragment a second time—with no knowledge that she had handled itbefore. Again she saw arches and a ‘place of worship’, but this time with someconference going on there. ‘These people are ignorant and bigoted’. A check withan encyclopedia revealed that Melrose Abbey was ‘usually involved in therancorous events of border feud and international war’. (‘Ignorant and bigoted’is an admirable description of the Scottish religious temperament of earliercenturies.) A piece of mosaic from a Roman bath brought a detailed descriptionof a Roman bath, with an atmosphere of ‘gaiety and voluptuousness’.A piece of mosaic from Pompeii brought an interesting description of an ancienttown with narrow streets, and a populace in the grip of war fever; Denton hadhoped for some mention of the destruction of Pompeii. But a piece of volcanicrock from Pompeii brought far more satisfying results. It was the size of asmall bean, and the psychometer was not allowed to see it. (Denton does notexplain how he did this, but presumably it was wrapped in paper or cloth.) MrsDenton saw coloured figures on a wall—frescoes—and observed that the buildingoverlooked the sea. Out of the window, she could look towards the mountain-top,and see smoke and cinders rising up in a column. The black cloud of dust wasspreading across the countryside. From a situation higher up the mountain shewas able to observe the eruption. ‘I feel the influence of human terror that Icannot describe.’ The land below finally became a desert of cinders. Watchingcrowds fleeing from Pompeii (in fact, most of the population escaped before thefinal catastrophe) she is surprised that it resembles a modern town more thanshe had expected.One interesting observation was that the volcano had also vomited water. Infact, Pompeii was engulfed by a kind of mud, not by molten lava. Bodies foundencased in the hardened material were unscorched. A description of the eruptionby Pliny the Younger describes a tree-like column of smoke rising from thevolcano, then spreading out like branches—or a mushroom-cloud—which thendescended and covered the town. Elizabeth Denton’s description was startlinglyclose.Almost a decade later, Denton returned to the subject of Pompeii. By now, hisson Sherman was in his mid-teens; he had been practising psychometry since hewas a child, and was in some ways more sensitive than his mother. The testsDenton conducted occupy more than fifty pages of his second volume, and theyprovide a remarkably rich and complex picture of life in Pompeii.Sherman’s first session—with a piece of plaster from the ‘House ofSallust’—immediately brought one remarkable ‘hit’. Over a doorway, Sherman ‘saw’a painting of two winged children drawing a cart with another winged childriding in it. Denton later discovered an engraving of the painting in a book onPompeii (which, he insists, neither he nor Sherman saw before the test), and hereproduces it in his text.When Sherman spoke of wide streets, Denton was dubious; most streets in Pompeiiwere hardly six feet across. But he later discovered that the House of Sallustwas not in the residential section, but on a square, in an area with widestreets. Sherman described a Pompeian boat with a prow like a swan’s head andneck. Denton found engravings from nearby Herculaneum (also engulfed in theeruption) of the cheniscus, a birdlike head and neck attached to the prow ofRoman vessels.Sherman also comments: ‘The labouring people seem to hate the rich. Where thereis a number of them together, the rich pass them quickly, and seem to regardthem as a man would a snake.’ Denton makes no attempt to verify this statement.But from a modern book, Pompeii and Herculaneum (1960) by Marcel Brion, we learnthat the walls of Pompeii contained such graffiti as ‘This city is too rich’ and‘I propose a share-out of the public wealth among the inhabitants’. The attitudeof the rich must have added fuel to this feeling of social injustice; in thehall of the House of Vedius Siricus there was an inscription, SalveLucrum—‘Hail, Profit!’ It also, comments Brion, meant ‘Welcome to money’,addressed as a welcome to other moneyed people who came to the house. ThePompeians, it becomes clear, took money-making very seriously indeed. In herearlier examination of a fragment from Pompeii, Mrs Denton had commented on thedifference she sensed between the Pompeians and the ancient Egyptians: that forthe Egyptians, religion was inherent in their way of life, while for thePompeians, it was largely a matter of forms and observances. But the wealthy hadstatues of Mercury in their houses to bring luck to their business and ward offevil spirits that might harm it. ‘Hail, profit!’Another of Sherman’s comments was that women seemed to play a prominent part inthe life of Pompeii; Brion remarks that in Pompeii the women took a hand inbusiness; even a rich woman advertised that she had shops to let.Sherman’s description of a theatrical performance makes it sound more like acircus with clowns and acrobats, and makes no mention of the kind of things amodern reader would expect—comedies by Plautus, Statius and Terence, Greektragedies and so on. Denton remarks that his son’s description of acrobats andcomics sounds very modern. But Marcel Brion comments that the favourite form ofdramatic entertainment at this time was the atellanae, popular farces that tooktheir name from their town of origin, Atella; originally intended to relax theaudience after performance of tragedies, they became so popular that they wereperformed on their own. Brion says of these performances: ‘They might becompared to music-hall numbers of a rather low level, interspersed with dancing,clowning, obscenities, feats of skill and athletic exhibitions, the whole endingwith a procession of nude girls.’ Apart from the nude girls (which Denton wouldno doubt have censored out) this is a fairly accurate summary of ShermanDenton’s lengthy description of a theatrical performance in Pompeii.The descriptions of Pompeii are certainly the highlight of Denton’s secondvolume; but there are other impressive things. By this time, Denton had becomeaware of the possibility of mind-reading, although he was inclined to discountit simply because he had noticed that his own expectations failed to influencethe ‘visions’ of the psychometrist. But he devised one interesting experiment toshow that the visions could be just as accurate when all possibility ofmind-reading had been excluded. He had made the interesting discovery that thepsychometer could look at a map, then close his eyes and experience a sensationof flying through the air until he came to the place he had seen. This facultyis known as ‘travelling clairvoyance’, and has been the subject of a great dealof modern research (for example, at Stanford University in the mid-1970s where,under laboratory conditions, the psychic Ingo Swann was able to demonstrate hisability to travel mentally to other places and describe accurately what washappening there). They chose at random the island of Socotra in the Gulf ofAden, and Mrs Denton was first asked to describe it. She stated that it was arocky island, ‘almost a rock in the sea’, with one coast high and mountainousand the other—the inhabited coast—low. There seemed to be two types of people.Those inland, the natives, were poor, and ‘there seems to be a wanderingdisposition about them’. Near the coast the people were ‘yellowish’ and engagedmore in business. All this proved (from an encyclopedia article on Socotra) tobe remarkably accurate. The geographical description is precise. The populationconsisted of two types—the original inhabitants, Bedouins, who lived inland andwho were nomadic, and Arab traders and agriculturalists who lived near thecoast.By comparison, Sherman Denton’s description sounds vague and inaccurate; hedescribed it as a green island without mountains (in fact, the mountains arefive thousand feet high), and continued with descriptions of natives who lived ahand-to-mouth existence. But the fact that Denton includes this relative failureis a testimony to his honesty.These first two volumes of The Soul of Things are both impressive and exciting;with their long descriptions of past ages, they read almost like a novel. Dentonwas as convinced as Buchanan that psychometry was a normal human faculty, a‘telescope into the past’ that could be developed by anyone who was willing totake the trouble. He gives the impression of being a rather better scientistthan Buchanan, more anxious to exclude possible error, and to explainpsychometry in terms of scientific theory. For example, he devotes a chapter tothe psychological curiosity that is now known as ‘eidetic imagery’ orphotographic memory—the ability some people (especially children) possess tolook at some object, then to project an exact image of it onto a blank sheet ofpaper. Newton discovered that, during his optical experiments, the image of thesun (seen in a darkened glass) kept returning like a hallucination. It wouldvanish when he forgot about it; but he only had to call it to mind to make itappear in front of him. Denton discovered many other descriptions of the samephenomenon: not just of simple images like the sun, but of whole scenes. Hequotes Professor Stevelly who, after watching bees swarming from hives,continued to have visual hallucinations of swarms of bees for days afterwards. Adoctor named Ferriar described how, in the evening, he could conjure up indetail some scene he had looked at during the day—an old ruin, a fine house, areview of troops; he had only to go into a darkened room to see it as if in acoloured photograph. The geologist Hugh Miller had a similar ability. He wrote:‘There are, I suspect, provinces in the philosophy of mind into which themetaphysicians have not yet entered. Of that accessible storehouse, in which thememories of past events lie arranged and taped up, they appear to know a gooddeal; but of a mysterious cabinet of daguerreotype pictures, of which, thoughfast locked up on ordinary occasions, disease sometimes flings the door ajar,they seem to know nothing.’More than a century later, Dr Wilder Penfield proved the truth of thisobservation when, during a brain operation, he touched the patient’s temporalcortex with the electric probe, and the patient suddenly ‘replayed’ precise andlengthy memories of childhood, all as minutely detailed as if they werehappening in the present.It is difficult to see at first what connection Denton saw between these visualhallucinations and psychometry—after all, they seem to have little enough incommon. But it slowly becomes clear that his wife and sister—and later hisson—actually saw these visions of the past; if the cinema had been invented atthe time, he might have compared it to a mental film show. These experiences ofhallucination seemed to offer a clue to this strange faculty of psychometricvision. Particularly interesting is Newton’s observation that he could make theimage of the sun reappear before his eyes by imagining it. What is suggestedhere is that the image was so vividly imprinted on his brain that it could be‘projected’ like a film by merely wanting to. This also seems to explainStevelly’s visions of the swarming bees and Ferriar’s of old ruins of finehouses. The philosopher Berdyaev has a passage in which he describes his ownhallucinatory vision of a woman called Mintslova—a disciple of RudolphSteiner—whom he regarded as a pernicious influence:I was lying in bed in my room half asleep; I could clearly see the room and thecorner opposite me where an icon was hanging with a little burning oil lampbefore it. I beheld the outline of Mintslova’s face: its expression was quitehorrifying—a face seemingly possessed of all the power of darkness. I gazed ather intently for a few seconds, and then, by an intense spiritual effort, forcedthe horrible vision to disappear.1It is significant that Berdyaev was half asleep, so that what might have beenmerely a dream-image was projected as a hallucination.The third volume of The Soul of Things makes us aware of the drawbacks of thisability. The frontispiece is a ‘Map of Jupiter’, with a key underneath listingsuch items as ‘Houses and city, seen 19 March 1870’, ‘Sugar loaf hills, seen 23March 1870’. And the longest section in the book is a chapter called‘Astronomical Examinations’, beginning with ‘A boy’s visit to Venus’, ‘Visit toa comet’, and including accounts of Mars and Jupiter. Sherman Denton’sobservations on Venus begin promisingly with the comment that its mountains arehigher than those on earth—which is true. But he then goes on to describe gianttrees shaped like toadstools and full of sweet jelly, and an animal that washalf-fish and half-muskrat. The 1962 Mariner space-probe revealed that thetemperature on the surface of Venus is 900°F, hot enough to melt solder, andtherefore too hot to support life. Sherman’s visit to a comet is equallydisappointing; he states that it is a planet that has become a kind of fireball.We are still not sure of where comets originate; but we know that they are oflow density, and almost certainly very cold. Sherman’s visit to the sun revealedthat it is made of molten lava which is hardening in places into a crust. Modernastronomy has shown that the sun is a ball of gas. A visit to Mars revealed thatit was much like earth, but peopled with men with four fingers, wide mouths,yellow hair and blue eyes. ‘It seems warm, like summer weather.’ (In fact, Marswould be very cold indeed, since it is more than 50,000,000 miles further fromthe sun than earth is.) Mrs Cridge and Mrs Denton also visited Mars, anddescribed its religion, its art and its scientific inventions. Sherman and MrsCridge both described Jupiter, also peopled by blue-eyed blondes who can floatin the air, and whose women all have plaits down to their waists. Modern spaceprobes have revealed that Jupiter is basically a ball of freezing gas with a hotliquid core.Volume three of The Soul of Things is undoubtedly an anticlimax, and no onecould be blamed for being inclined to dismiss the whole work as an absurd pieceof self-deception. But before we throw the baby out with the bath water, wemight recollect the parallel case of Emanuel Swedenborg. That remarkable mysticdevoted the first fifty-six years of his life to science and engineering; thenhe began having strange dreams, hallucinations and trances. In these visionarystates, he believed he had visited heaven and hell, and his books containdetailed accounts of the ‘afterworld’, all of which his disciples—who were soonnumbered in thousands—accepted as literal truth. A century before the rise ofspiritualism, Swedenborg claimed to be able to converse with spirits of thedead. When the queen of Sweden asked him to give her greetings to her deadbrother, the prince royal of Denmark, Swedenborg said he would. Soon after, hetold her that her brother sent his greetings, and apologized for not answeringher last letter. He would now do so through Swedenborg . . . As Swedenborgdelivered the detailed message, the queen turned pale, and said, ‘No one but Godknows this secret’. On another occasion, in 1761, the widow of the Dutchambassador told Swedenborg that she was having trouble with a silversmith whowas demanding payment for a silver tea-service; a few days later, Swedenborgtold her he had spoken to her husband, and that he had paid for the tea-service;the receipt would be found in a secret compartment in his bureau drawer.Swedenborg also mentioned some secret correspondence that would be found in thesame drawer. Both the receipt and the correspondence were found where Swedenborghad said.In July 1759, Swedenborg was able to tell guests at a party in Gothenburg that agreat fire had broken out in Stockholm, 300 miles away. Two hours later he toldone of the guests that the fire had been extinguished only three doors from hishome. Two days later, a messenger arrived confirming these details.So, understandably, Swedenborg’s disciples believed him when he described the‘spirit realms’, and his visits to other planets. Mercury, he said, had amoderate temperature, and its beings were more spiritual than human beings; theplanet also had cattle that were a cross between cows and stags. Venus had tworaces living on opposite sides of the planet, one mild and humane, the othersavage and violent—the latter being giants. Martians had faces that were halfblack and half white, and communicated by a kind of telepathy; they were alsovegetarians. The inhabitants of Jupiter—whom Swedenborg claimed to know moreintimately than those of any other planet—looked like human beings, but were farmore gentle and humane, and naturally moral and virtuous. Those in warm regionswent naked—except for a covering over the loins—and were astonished to be toldthat human beings could be sexually excited by another’s nakedness. Theinhabitants of the moon had thunderous voices, which were produced by a kind ofbelching . . .How can these contradictions be resolved? One answer is suggested by Dr WilsonVan Dusen in his book Presence of Other Worlds. Van Dusen argues that there isstrong evidence that Swedenborg’s visions were seen in ‘hypnagogic states’, thestates in which we linger between sleep and waking. Swedenborg seems to confirmthis when he writes: ‘Once, when I awoke at daybreak, I saw . . . diverselyshaped apparitions floating before my eyes . . .’ Swedenborg’s descriptions ofvarious kinds of spirits—particularly the ‘damned’—sound as if he isdeliberately writing in parables; but the descriptions are as precise anddetailed as those of a novelist. The most probable answer is that Swedenborg haddeveloped a faculty very similar to that discussed by Denton in the chapter onNewton, Hugh Miller and others who experienced visual hallucinations. The severemental crisis that changed him in his mid-fifties from a scientist to avisionary allowed the unconscious mind to erupt into consciousness; he could, ineffect, dream with his eyes open.But if the visions of planets—and probably of heaven and hell—wereself-deception, then how do we explain the accuracy of the vision of theStockholm fire, and the information about the secret drawer and the queen’sletter? The answer is that, unfortunately, the possession of genuine‘clairvoyant’ or mediumistic faculty is no guarantee of the truthfulness ofother kinds of vision. In fact, the best clairvoyants and psychometrists havealways been willing to admit that they can be confused by telepathic impressionsfrom other people.And so we must count the third volume of The Soul of Things a failure—but a mostextraordinary failure which does little to obscure the achievement of the firsttwo volumes. It is a pity that Mrs Denton and Mrs Cridge were unable todistinguish between genuine ‘clairvoyance’ and the products of their ownimagination; But, to be fair, we should admit that they had no reason to.Thomson Jay Hudson devotes some space to Denton and his geological experimentsin The Law of Psychic Phenomena; (Denton was dead by that time—he had died inNew Guinea in 1883, while on a world lecture tour.) Recalling what Hudson had tosay about the hidden powers of the ‘subjective mind’, you might expect him topraise Denton as another explorer of the ‘invisible palace’. Yet, oddly enough,he rejects Denton’s ‘telescope into the past’ as self-deception. According toHudson, everything Mrs Denton discovered could be explained by the telepathicpowers of the subjective mind. She was simply able to read her husband’s mind.But surely, Denton had gone to enormous trouble to make sure that even he didnot know what was in the various brown paper parcels? Hudson dismisses this. Thesubjective mind possesses immense powers of observation and memory, and it wouldbe child’s play for the subjective mind to see through the elementaryprecautions taken by Denton . . .This sounds plausible, until we look more closely into Denton’s experiments. Ifthe visions originated in his own mind, then why did his wife and sister—andlater his son—often produce different pictures from different periods in thesample’s history—as with the piece of mosaic from the villa of Cicero? Why didMrs Denton describe a man who sounds like Sulla when Denton was expecting her todescribe Cicero? And if, indeed, it was Sulla she described, and Denton had noidea that Sulla had lived in the villa, then telepathy would have beenimpossible.Hudson could, of course, have countered these objections. If Denton’s wife andsister selected different parts of the sample’s history to describe, then theywere merely selecting from the knowledge in Denton’s mind. As to Denton notknowing that it was the dictator’s villa, perhaps he did know, but had long agoforgotten that he had read it . . .But the real objection to Hudson’s arguments is that he is willing to credit thesubjective mind with powers just as remarkable as psychometry—for example,healing a relative at a thousand miles. If the subjective mind can pick upvibrations from another mind, then why can it not pick up vibrations from aletter or a piece of mosaic? Hudson even credits the subjective mind with thepower to foretell the future; he says that its deductive powers are sotremendous that it can calculate every possibility—like some giganticcomputer—and select the likeliest one. He gives a great deal of space to the‘daemon’ of Socrates—the inner voice that would give the philosopher good adviceand warm him of impending danger; this, says Hudson, is simply the subjectivemind making itself heard as a kind of voice inside the head. (A modern exponentof split-brain theory, Julian Jaynes, believes that the ancients heard ‘voices’that came from the right cerebral hemisphere.) If the subjective mind possessesthese remarkable powers, it seems contradictory to deny it the power ofpsychometry.The explanation of Hudson’s ‘tough-minded’ attitude is probably that he wasunwilling to expose his newborn theory to ridicule by appearing too credulous.In fact, we can see in retrospect that many of his mistakes sprang out of beingtoo sceptical. His chapter on crime and hypnosis provides two examples. Heargues that no one could be made to commit a crime under hypnosis, because theprophetic powers of the subjective mind would make it aware that it might leadto disaster. In fact, many crimes have been committed under hypnosis—one of thebest known examples being the Copenhagen case of 1951, when a man named PalleHardrup robbed a bank and murdered the cashier under hypnotic suggestion. Hudsonalso remarks that committing suicide under hypnosis is as unlikely as committinga crime under hypnosis; in fact, this is precisely what did happen in the Salacase of 1929, when the hypnotist Sigwart Thurneman made a member of his criminalgang commit suicide by hypnotic suggestion.1But these criticisms fail to obscure the remarkable nature of Hudson’sachievement. The Law of Psychic Phenomena is one of the most importantcontributions to nineteenth-century thought, and deserves to be as well-known asThe Origin of Species or Das Kapital. But, within a few years of the book’spublication, Sigmund Freud’s theory of the unconscious mind had become stillmore notorious. Freud also believed that the unconscious is far more powerfulthan the conscious mind; but Freud’s unconscious is entirely negative, a kind ofgigantic dustbin full of guilt, misery and repressions. Freud seemed even moresceptical and tough-minded than Hudson, and the result was that his morecontroversial theories won the day, and Hudson’s were forgotten.In fact, modern split-brain research has shown that Hudson’s ideas have asounder basis than Freud’s. It is now a matter of scientific fact that we havetwo ‘selves’ inside our heads, that one is intuitive and the other intellectual,and that genius, as Hudson said, is a close co-operation between the two. So itis important to look again at Hudson’s contribution, and give careful thought tosome of his insights. His most important recognition is that human beingspossess mental powers of which they are unaware. He was right to emphasize themystery of calculating prodigies; for their abilities seem to defy what weregard as the normal laws of the mind. They often appear out of the blue, inperfectly normal children, and later vanish just as abruptly. Archbishop Whatelysaid that his own powers appeared at the age of six, when he knew nothing aboutfigures except simple addition; suddenly, he could do tremendous calculations inhis head. When he went to school three years later, ‘the passion wore off, andhe became a dunce at mathematics. The powers of such prodigies seem incredible.One 6-year-old boy, Benjamin Blyth, was out walking-with his father when heasked what time he was born. His father told him four a.m. A few minutes later,the child stated the number of seconds he had lived. When they got home, hisfather worked it out on paper, and told Ben he was 172,800 seconds wrong. ‘No’,said the child, ‘you have forgotten two leap years’.Most calculating prodigies lose their powers in their teens, when life becomesmore complex and difficult, and sexual changes in the body disturb the emotions.But the inference is that our brains have an extraordinary power that few of usever bother to develop.Where psychometry is concerned, the power of ‘eidetic vision’ is even moreimportant, as Denton recognised. Modern research has revealed that between 8 and20 per cent of all children may possess eidetic vision—the power to conjure upan image so powerfully that it looks like a film projection. One test involvesthe use of ‘random dot stereograms’. Two sheets of paper contain apparentlyrandom patterns of ten thousand dots, but when these are superimposed, a pictureemerges. Many children can look at one pattern, then move their eyes to theother sheet, and see the two patterns combining into a picture. This isobviously a right-brain function—it is the right brain that recognizes patternsand shapes—and again the inference is that we gradually lose it as the leftbrain becomes more powerful, to ‘cope’ with reality. But if this is correct,then all human beings possess a latent power to ‘photograph’ what they arelooking at, and to project the photograph later in all its detail. As we haveseen in the cases cited by Denton, this ‘projection’ is a deliberate act of willand imagination. But Hudson’s artist friend was able to project purely imaginaryscenes on his canvas. And this, again, would be perfectly natural. If we havethe latent power to ‘hold’ mental photographs and keep them in some memory-file,then there is no reason why the imagination should not combine them, or simplyinvent its own mental photographs.The psychologist C.G. Jung also recognized this power, which he called ‘activeimagination’, and he believed that anyone could develop it with sufficienteffort. Jung made the discovery accidentally. In 1913, after his break withFreud, Jung was experiencing severe mental problems that made him fear insanity.Sitting at his desk one day, he says, ‘I let myself drop. Suddenly it was asthough the ground literally gave way beneath my feet, and I plunged down intodark depths.’ There followed a waking dream in which Jung found himself in anunderground cave, guarded by a mummified dwarf, and saw the body of a blondyouth with a wound in his head float past on a stream.In his autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, Jung goes on to describehis deliberate development of techniques to enter this realm of ‘waking dreams’:‘In order to seize hold of the fantasies, I frequently imagined a steep descent.I even made several attempts to get to the very bottom. The first time Ireached, as it were, a depth of about a thousand feet; the next time I foundmyself at the edge of a cosmic abyss. It was like a voyage to the moon, or adescent into empty space. First came the image of a crater, and I had a feelingthat I was in the land of the dead. The atmosphere was that of the other world.Near the steep slope of a rock I caught sight of two figures, an old man with awhite beard, and a beautiful young girl. I summoned up my courage and approachedthem as though they were real people, and listened attentively to what they toldme . . .’Here we can see clearly that Jung had entered a hypnagogic realm in which heremained wide-awake whilst at the same time encountering the strange creationsof that ‘other self inside us. It is, admittedly, difficult for most of us toaccept the notion of such an ability; but we should bear in mind that a dogwould find it quite impossible to conceive the mental state of a child reading abook, with half his consciousness in the ‘real world’ and the other half in aworld of fantasy. Jung’s ‘active imagination’ is only a single step beyond thisability that every educated person possesses.And now at last we are in a position to understand those detailed descriptionsof ‘other worlds’ that we find in Swedenborg and Denton. A good psychometerpossesses the power to ‘read’ objects in the way that a bloodhound can recognizescents. When this reading becomes second nature, it is accompanied byimages—images that are sometimes so detailed and real that they amount toeidetic visions. When Mrs Denton described Cicero’s villa, or when ShermanDenton described the theatre in ancient Pompeii, they were using activeimagination as a tool to amplify their readings. But when they tried to‘psychometrize’ Mars or Jupiter, there were no psychometric impressions toamplify, and the subjective mind—which, according to Van Dusen, is anincorrigible performer that hates to admit defeat—produced elaborate wakingdreams.This tendency of the unconscious to spin its own webs of fantasy certainlycomplicates the question of psychometry. But, unlike Swedenborg and Denton, weare at least aware of the problem; and this is already an important step towardsolving it.And what of those pioneers of the paranormal, Joseph Rodes Buchanan and WilliamDenton? Sadly, it must be recorded that neither of them achieved the place inintellectual history that they undoubtedly deserve. Denton, the younger of thetwo, died in 1883, at the age of sixty, and was thereafter virtually forgotten.Buchanan fared slightly better. His Manual of Psychometry came out in 1885, andgained him new readers and followers. But by that time, his original ‘nerveaura’ theory of psychometry had been expanded to a point that most seriousinvestigators found totally unacceptable.The experiment that placed him beyond the limits of science was suggested by hisinterest in the new art of photography (for we are now retracing our steps tothe 1850s). He tried handing photographs—suitably covered—to the psychometer, tosee what impressions they produced. And with good psychometers like his wife hereceived convincing and accurate descriptions of the sitter. But this experimentought not to have worked, since a photograph is mechanically produced, andtherefore—unless its subject happened to have held it in his hands—should carryno personal ‘vibrations’. Yet it did work. Buchanan concluded that ‘there wasnot, in such cases, any emanation from the person described, and the picture wasmerely the presentation of an idea to be grasped by the intuitive perceptionwhich is independent of vision’. [My italics].Clearly, this innocent-sounding statement either conceals a total breakdown oflogic, or represents a revolutionary new theory of the nature of psychometry.According to Buchanan, it was a new theory. ‘Hence’, he declares, ‘it becameapparent that the object for psychometry was in such cases merely an index [hemeans an indication] leading the mind to the object represented, and need not bea picture, a relic, or anything associated in any way with the person or thingto be explored.’If this ‘intuitive perception which is independent of vision’ could work on aphotograph, it ought to work just as well on a mere name. Buchanan tried it ‘Iwrote the name of a friend and placed it in the hands of a good psychometer, whohad no difficulty, notwithstanding her doubts of so novel a proceeding . . . ingiving as good a description of Dr N. as if he had made the description from anautograph.’Buchanan was carried away by wild enthusiasm. ‘Psychometry’, he declared, ‘isthe earthly IRRADIATION OF OMNISCIENCE and it will be known hereafter topenetrate all things.’ And he went on to ask his sensitives to psychometrize thenames of all kinds of famous people: Homer, Shakespeare, Bacon, Jesus, Socrates,Confucius, the Buddha and St Paul. A later volume called Primitive Christianityeven contains a re-edited version of the Gospel of St John.And if a psychometrist can gather information from the past, then why not fromthe future? By 1884, the whole world was talking about the Moslem revolt in theSudan, led by a religious fanatic called the Mahdi. General Gordon had been sentto try to subdue him. Buchanan wrote the name ‘Mahdi’ on a sheet of paper, andasked a number of his students to try their powers on it. They producedimpressions of a tropical country, a bloody war, men in Arab dress, and a leaderof deep religious convictions—all of which might have been expected if they wereunconsciously reading Buchanan’s mind. What is rather more surprising is thatmany of their predictions for the future were accurate. Buchanan admired theMahdi and disliked the British, so any predictions based on his subconscioushopes would involve victory for the Mahdi and defeat for the British. In fact,most of his students predicted that the Mahdi would ultimately be unsuccessful.When Buchanan asked ‘Is he about to capture a city?’ (meaning Khartoum) thereply was: ‘He is preparing for an attack, but will be repulsed.’ In fact, theMahdi did attack Khartoum, and was repulsed. Later, Buchanan again asked hiswife about the war, and she predicted another attack with terrible bloodshed;within two days, the Mahdi had stormed Khartoum and murdered all the defenders,including Gordon. She went on to prophesy that the war would not continue in thesummer, and that the British would withdraw their troops; both things happenedas she had said. The prediction that ‘the war will be disastrous’ for the Mahdiwas also fulfilled; success made him fat and lazy; after the fall of Khartoum hewithdrew into his harem for a prolonged debauch and died a few months later.None of this surprised Buchanan; if, after all, psychometry was the ‘irradiationof omniscience’, the future should present no more problems than the past.Buchanan pointed out, reasonably, that there have been many well-authenticatedcases of precognition—he devotes a whole appendix of his Manual to theremarkable story of the French author Jacques Cazotte who, at a dinner partyjust before the French Revolution, accurately foretold the fate of almosteveryone sitting at the table: Chamfort would open his veins with a razor,Condorcet would take poison to avoid the guillotine, and a notorious atheistnamed La Harpe would become a Christian. La Harpe was so derisive that he wenthome and wrote it all down. But in due course, it all happened exactly asCazotte had said—even to La Harpe becoming a monk. I shall discuss this morefully in Chapter 13 [../Text/18_chapter13.html].As far as contemporary science was concerned, all this was enough to placeBuchanan beyond the pale. Even the American Society for PsychicalResearch—formed in the same year that the Manual was published—found nothing ofinterest in Buchanan’s latest theories. Yet it is worth remarking, in passing,that some of Buchanan’s own prophecies were surprisingly accurate. In 1859, hepublished in the Louisville Journal a prediction that America would experiencesix years of calamity; the Civil War lasted from 1861 to 1865. In 1885, hepredicted a ‘period of calamity thirty years hence’—twenty-nine years before theGreat War. He also remarked that there would probably be an ‘elementalconvulsion’ on the Pacific side of America, and that ‘I would prefer not toreside in San Francisco at that time’. At the time Buchanan was writing, theonly Californian earthquake in which there had been fatalities (40 dead) hadoccurred in 1868, and it involved six major cities. Buchanan had been dead sixyears when the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 destroyed 28,000 houses andkilled 700 people.He also had a prophecy concerning himself: that in the coming century he wouldbe remembered as the ‘herald of the coming illumination’, and that a statuewould be erected to him. This prophecy has not so far been fulfilled; but thereis still time. 1. For a longer account of both cases see chapters 4 [../Text/09_chapter04.html]and 7 [../Text/12_chapter07.html].1.

Equally decisive was the rise of the movement called Spiritualism, whichswept across Europe and America in the 1850s, even reaching the most far-flungoutposts of the Russian empire. This had its starting point in a series ofextraordinary events that occurred in the home of the Fox family, in Hydesville,New York, which we shall examine in a moment. But long before anyone outside NewYork had heard of the Fox family, a book about ‘spirits’ was creating asensation on the other side of the Atlantic. It was called The Night Side ofNature, and its authoress was an Edinburgh housewife named Catherine Crowe, whohad already achieved a modest success with novels like Susan Hopley and LilyDawson. The Night Side of Nature—subtitled ‘Ghosts and Ghost Seers’—made her acelebrity, and went on to become one of the most influential books of the 19thcentury.Regrettably, Mrs Crowe did not enjoy her success for long. In 1859, she produceda treatise called ‘Spiritualism and the Age We Live In’—which, according to theDictionary of National Biography, evinced ‘a morbid and despondent turn ofmind’, and soon after this she went insane—a fate her contemporaries must havefelt she had invited by her interest in such macabre subjects. She recovered,but wrote little between then and her death in 1876. The Night Side of Natureremained as popular as ever, and was still on sale on railway bookstalls (pricetwo shillings) at the turn of the century.The author of the piece in the Dictionary of National Biography was clearly nota believer in ghosts and ghost seers; for while he admits that the book is ‘oneof the best collections of supernatural stories in our language’, he thenattacks Mrs Crowe for being ‘extremely credulous and uncritical’. The reproachis unfair; the book would not have become so influential if it had been merely acollection of ghost stories. What the Victorians liked about it was its air ofsturdy commonsense, and its attempts to treat the phenomena with detachment. Itwould be more than thirty years before scientific investigators approached thesupernatural in a spirit of systematic research. But Mrs Crowe did her best,citing letters and documents and offering names of witnesses and dates.The book that inspired The Night Side of Nature was another nineteenth-centurybestseller called The Seeress of Prevorst. It was written by Dr Justinus A.C.Kerner, a rich and eccentric doctor who was also a well-known poet andsong-writer. In 1826, the 40-year-old Kerner was practising in Weinsberg, nearHeilbronn, when he was consulted by the relatives of a woman called FriederikeHauffe, who was dying of a wasting disease. She had lost all her teeth andlooked like a walking skeleton.It seemed that marriage was responsible for her sad condition. Ever sincechildhood she had fallen into trances, seen visions, and conversed withinvisible spirits. She could also accurately predict the future. When she wasnineteen, she had married a cousin, and gone into depression; at twenty, herfirst child was born, and she began to develop hysterical symptoms. Everyevening, she fell into a trance in which she saw spirits of the dead.Kerner was at first inclined to be sceptical about her visions and spirits—heput them down to hysteria. Yet he found Friederike Hauffe a fascinating case forstudy. She claimed to be able to see into the human body, and certainly had aremarkably precise knowledge of the nervous system. She could read with herstomach—Kerner tested her by making her lie down with her eyes closed, and laiddocuments on her bare midriff; she read them perfectly. She could makegeometrical drawings at great speed, even in the dark, and could draw perfectcircles that looked as if they had been drawn by compasses. She claimed that herspirit often left her body and hovered above it.Kerner tried ordinary medicines on her, but they had no effect. Friederike toldhim that if he placed her in a ‘magnetic trance’ the spirits would instruct himon how to treat her, but he was reluctant to accept this advice. Eventually, hedecided that he might as well try the effects of mesmerism.Friederike reacted well to ‘magnetism’, passing easily into a trance. But Kernerremained sceptical about the things she said in this condition. Then, one day, aremarkable experience changed his mind. Friederike declared that she was beinghaunted by an unpleasant man with a squint. From her description, Kernerrecognised him as a man who had died a few years earlier. It seemed, accordingto Friederike, that the man was suffering from a guilty conscience. He had beeninvolved in embezzlement and, after his death, another man had been blamed. Nowhe wanted to clear the man’s name, for the sake of his widow. This could be doneby means of a certain document, which would be found in a chest. The spirit‘showed’ Friederike the room where the document was to be found, and a man whowas working there. Her description was so good that Kerner was able to identifyhim as a certain Judge Heyd. In her ‘vision’, Friederike had seen Judge Heydsitting in a certain place in this room, and the chest containing the documenton the table. The document was apparently not in its proper numerical order,which is why it had not been found.When Kerner told him about his patient’s vision, Judge Heyd was astounded; hehad been sitting in the position described on that particular day (ChristmasDay), and the chest, contrary to regulations, had been left open on the table.When they searched, the document turned up where Friederike had said it would.The widow of the man who had been wrongly accused was able to obtain redress.From now on, Kerner believed in Friederike’s supernatural powers, and tookwhatever she said seriously. She told him that we are surrounded by spirits allthe time, and that she was able to see them. These spirits often try to attractour attention in various ways: knocking, movement of objects, throwing of sand.And by way of convincing him, Friederike persuaded one of the spirits to makerapping noises, to make gravel and ash fall from the air, and to make a stoolfloat up into the air. Kerner watched with amazement as the stool rose gently,then floated down again.Friederike provided him with further proof of the accuracy of her visions whenshe succeeded in putting an end to a haunting. Kerner heard about a house wherethe ghost of an old man was frightening the inhabitants. He brought one of them,a woman, along to see Friederike; the seeress went into a trance and explainedthat the ghost was that of a man called Bellon, who was an ‘earth-bound spirit’as a result of defrauding two orphans. Kerner made enquiries, but no one hadever heard of a man called Bellon. But since the ghost claimed that he had beenBurgomeister, it seemed probable that some record existed. He claimed he hadbeen Burgomeister in the year 1700, and had died at the age of 79 Armed withthis information, Kerner asked the present mayor to check the legal documents;they soon found that in the year 1700, a man called Bellon had been Burgomeisterand director of the local orphanage. He had died in 1740 at the age of 79. After‘confessing’, the spirit took its departure.While Friederike was in Kerner’s house, there were constant poltergeistphenomena: knocks and raps, noises like the rattling of chains, gravel thrownthrough the window, and a knitting needle that flew through the air and landedin a glass of water. When Friederike was visited by a spirit one night hersister heard her say: ‘Open it yourself, then saw a book on the table openitself. A poltergeist tugged her boots off her feet as she lay on the bed, andthrew a lampshade across the room. In the Kerners’ bedroom, a table was thrownacross the room. The poltergeist threw a stool at a maidservant who went intoFriederike’s room while she lay asleep. It extinguished a night-light and made acandle glow.Friederike also produced what would later be called ‘spirit teachings’, anamazingly complex system of philosophy in which man is described as consistingof body, soul and spirit, and of being surrounded by a nerve aura which carrieson the vital processes. She spoke about various cycles in human existence—lifecycles (or circles) and sun cycles, corresponding to various spiritualconditions. She also described a remarkable universal language from ancienttimes, said to be ‘the language of the inner life’. (A mystical sect was foundedto expound those doctrines after her death.)All these mediumistic activities made Friederike more and more feeble, and shedied in 1829 at the age of 28. Kerner’s book The Seeress of Prevorst (the nameof the Swabian village where she was born) created a sensation.In the second half of the 19th century, as the scientific reaction againstspiritualism increased, The Seeress of Prevorst ceased to be taken seriously bythose engaged in psychical research, and by the 20th century it had beenvirtually forgotten. Writing about it in his Modem Spiritualism (1902), thesceptical Frank Podmore—who believed that all poltergeists are due to naughtychildren—dismisses most of the evidence as second-hand, while another eminentresearcher, E.J. Dingwall (writing in Abnormal Hypnotic Phenomena) seems to feelthat Kerner was stupid to take her claims seriously, and that if he had remainedsceptical and treated her simply as a case of hysteria, she would have livedlonger. But reading Kerner’s own account, it is difficult to see how he wouldhave remained sceptical without being downright dishonest or blind; on oneoccasion, he saw a cloudy figure hovering in front of her, and although it hadvanished when he came back with a lamp, Friederike continued to stare at thespot as though listening to it.In fact, we can see that the case of the seeress of Prevorst is a thoroughlytypical case of poltergeist phenomena caused by a medium. In detail afterdetail, it sounds like any number of other cases of ‘haunting’. If anyone killedFriederike Hauffe, it was the spirits themselves, who must have been using herenergy to manifest themselves. No doubt the poltergeist phenomena wereunspectacular because Friederike was weak from the moment Kerner set eyes onher. (In a case cited by the novelist William de Morgan, a maidservant who wasable to cause rapping noises gradually lost her powers as she became weaker fromtuberculosis.)In another of his books, Kerner describes another remarkable case with some ofthe characteristics of poltergeist haunting. He was asked to treat a ‘possessed’peasant girl in Orlach, near Stuttgart. For some reason which is not clear, shewas persecuted by ‘spirits’ from the age of twenty, and there were the usualbangs and crashes, movements of furniture, and even outbreaks of fire. Then,after five months of this, she saw two ghosts, one of a nun dressed in white,the other of a monk dressed in black. The nun asserted that she had beensmuggled into the monastery disguised as a cook, and had had two children by theblack monk, both of whom he had killed at birth. He also murdered three monksduring the four-year period she was with him; and, when he suspected she wasabout to betray him, he killed her too. The black monk also spoke to thepossessed girl, saying that he was the son of a nobleman from nearby Geislingen,and that as the Superior at the monastery of Orlach, he had seduced a number ofnuns and killed the children they bore. He also confessed to killing monks. Thebodies, he said, he threw into a hole in a wall.The white nun told the girl that her sufferings would cease only if her parentsagreed to their cottage’s demolition. By this time they were so desperate thatthey agreed. On March 5, 1833 the house was finally demolished. Most of thewalls were made of mud, but one corner was constructed of limestone, obviouslypart of a far older building. When this was pulled down, they found underneathit an empty well containing a number of human bones, including those ofchildren. The girl’s possession ceased from the moment the wall collapsed.The story sounds like a typical invention of a German romantic novelist; butKerner devotes a whole book to it, describing it in the same detail as hisinvestigation of Friederike Hauffe. In spite of this, modern investigators areinclined not to take it seriously. Yet readers who are impressed by the clarityand detail of Kerner’s reporting may feel that this case of the possessed girlof Orlach is one of the most convincing arguments for the close connectionbetween poltergeists and spirits of the dead.Ten years after publication of The Seeress of Prevorst, another doctor—this timeof philosophy—produced an equally remarkable account of a case of possession,this time benevolent. In Die Schutzgeister (The Guardian Spirit, 1839), HeinrichWerner identifies his 18-year-old subject only as ‘R.O’. Like Friederike, shehad been subject to all kinds of illnesses, then, at a certain point, foundherself haunted by spirits. One day the girl fell into a trance; and from thenon she was able to do so at will, and to supply Werner with all kinds ofinformation obtained ‘clairvoyantly’. She had a guardian spirit called Albert,who seems to have acted rather like the ‘spirit guide’ of later mediums. And thespirit who caused her so much trouble was—again—a wicked monk. One day, when thegirl claimed that the wicked monk was present in the room, Werner was puzzled tohear an odd sound coming from a small table—like a cup rattling on a saucer.This occurred a number of times, becoming steadily louder (a typicalcharacteristic of poltergeist noises); R.O. said that the monk was producing thenoise, and was delighted at Werner’s astonishment—which also sounds typical of apoltergeist.One day, Werner was startled to hear a loud crash from an empty room; he rushedin to find that two large flowerpots, which had stood on the windowsill, hadbeen hurled to the floor so violently that there was earth all over the room.The blind was closed and there was no breeze. One of the curtains had also beentwisted around a birdcage. Later that day, Werner went to call on R.O., who wentinto a trance, and then told Werner that the black monk had been responsible forsmashing the flowerpots (Werner had not mentioned this to her). Albert,apparently, had ejected him from the house.Werner was greatly impressed by his patient’s clairvoyant powers. Shedemonstrated these one day when she woke up from a trance and told him that shehad seen herself driving in a green-lacquered chaise. Now Werner had, at thetime, made some enquiries about a chaise that was for sale in a town somefifteen hours away, and he expected to get an answer in about a week. R.O. toldhim he would hear much sooner than that—in fact, the following afternoon; shealso went on to describe the chaise, in some detail. The following afternoon,Werner received a message about the chaise, and discovered that the girl wasright in every detail.Her most dramatic piece of clairvoyance concerned her younger sister. One day,in a trance, she cried out ‘Albert, help me! Emilie is falling down into thestreet.’ Then, after a short period, she said: ‘Thank God, help has alreadycome!’Asked what had happened, she explained that her little sister had been leaningout of a top-storey window, trying to grab a rope suspended from a winch abovethe window; she had been on the point of falling when her father had entered theroom and pulled her back.Werner contacted the father to ask if anything remarkable had happened on thatparticular day, and received a reply which Werner printed in his book; it saidthat the father had been sitting in his office when he had felt uneasy. He wenthome, and went upstairs, in time to find his daughter had leaned too far out ofthe window to catch the rope, and could not get back into the room; he grabbedher dress and hauled her back in. R.O. said that it was Albert, the guardianspirit, who had made her father feel uneasy.The cases described by Justinus Kerner and Heinrich Werner excited widepreadinterest in Europe, and led to much serious discussion. Catherine Crowe read itand was deeply impressed. When her translation appeared in 1845, it aroused asmuch interest as it had in Germany. And it convinced Mrs Crowe of the reality ofthe supernatural.So far, she had been the disciple of a famous Edinburgh doctor George Combe,Britain’s most famous exponent of phrenology—the doctrine that a man’s charactercan be read through the bumps on his skull—and Combe was a determined scepticabout ghosts and such matters. Kerner—and Friederike—made her a convert. It nowcame to her as a revelation that the ‘scientific spirit’ had gone too far.‘Because, in the 17th century, credulity outran reason and discretion, the 18thcentury, by a natural reaction, flung itself into an opposite extreme.’ And the19th century had carried this attitude to the point of absurdity; in fact, ithad become a new kind of superstition, refusing to face facts that contradictedits dogmas.Mrs Crowe was not particularly credulous. She set about unearthing her ownfacts, and found that they seemed to fit together into a logical pattern. Almosteverything she wrote about would later be studied more systematically byparapsychologists, and carefully documented in scientific archives: dreaming ofthe future, death-bed visions, premonitions of disaster, ‘phantasms’ of theliving and of the dead, poltergeists, spontaneous psychokinesis, evenpossession. She reproaches contemporary scientists for insisting that thesupernatural can be explained in terms of hysteria or nervous derangement, andpoints out, quite fairly, that they ‘arrange the facts to their theory, nottheir theory to the facts’. What is now needed, she says, is investigation. ‘Andby investigation I do not mean the hasty, captious, angry notice of an unwelcomefact . . . but the slow, modest, pains-taking examination that is content towait upon nature, and humbly follow out her disclosures, however opposed topreconceived theories or mortifying to human pride.’ Here she seems to beechoing a famous remark by Thomas Henry Huxley about the duty of the scientist:‘Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up everypreconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses natureleads, or you shall learn nothing.’ It is interesting to discover that Huxleywrote this sentence in 1860, more than a decade after The Night Side of Nature,which was published in 1846; Huxley may, in fact, be echoing Mrs Crowe.Her aim, she readily admits, is to see whether the evidence proves that somepart of man can survive his death. The first step in this direction—and it waslater followed by most of her eminent successors, such as Myers and Tyrrell—wasto try to show that man possesses powers that cannot be explained by science.She devotes several chapters to dreams and presentiments of the future, andincludes a number of experiences gathered from friends:‘Another friend lately dreamt, one Thursday night, that he saw an acquaintanceof his thrown from his horse, and that he was lying on the ground with the bloodstreaming from his face, and was much cut. He mentioned his dream in themorning, and being an entire disbeliever in such phenomena, he was unable toaccount for the impression it made on his mind. This was so strong that, onSaturday, he could not forebear calling at his friend’s house, who he was toldwas in bed, having been thrown from his horse on the previous day, and muchinjured about the face.’If Mrs Crowe had lived to become a member of the Society for Physical Research,she would have gone to the trouble of getting signed statements from her friend,the man who had the accident, and the person he told about the dream the morningafter. As a pioneer in the field, she obviously felt that this was unnecessary.Otherwise, it is difficult to fault her method.Like every writer on the paranormal, she is particularly fascinated byout-of-the-body experiences, for she rightly regards these as potential proofthat there is something in man that can exist outside the body. Again, she doesher best to offer facts that could be checked:‘The late Mr John Holloway, of the Bank of England, brother to the engraver ofthat name, related of himself that being one night in bed with his wife andunable to sleep, he had fixed his eyes and thoughts with uncommon intensity on abeautiful star that was shining in at the window, when he suddenly found hisspirit released from his body and soaring into that bright sphere. But,instantly seized with anxiety for the anguish of his wife, if she discovered hisbody apparently dead beside her, he returned and re-entered it with difficulty .. . He described that returning as returning to darkness; and that whilst thespirit was free, he was alternately in the light or in the dark, accordingly ashis thoughts were with his wife or with the star. He said that he always avoidedanything that could produce a repetition of this accident, the consequences ofit being very distressing.’Mrs Crowe’s main problem was that, working mainly from hearsay, she had nosimple way of distinguishing the authentic from the inauthentic. A typicalexample is a case she cites from Heinrich Jung-Stilling. Now Jung-Stilling was aserious investigator of the paranormal, a Professor of Economics, and a followerof the doctrines of Mesmer. He ought to have been a reliable authority. And thestory he tells is in many ways a good case of what was later to be called a‘phantasm of the living’. In Philadelphia around the year 1740, saysJung-Stilling, a clairvoyant was approached by the wife of a sea captain, whowas anxious because she had not heard from her husband for a long time. Theclairvoyant asked her to excuse him, and went into another room. After a while,the woman became impatient, and went and peeped through a crack in the door; theclairvoyant was lying on a sofa, apparently asleep. When he came back, he toldher that her husband was alive and well, but had been unable to write to her forvarious reasons, which he explained. At this moment, he said, the captain was ina coffee-house in London, and would soon be back home.In due course, the captain returned, and confirmed the reasons that theclairvoyant had given for failing to write. And when he was introduced to theclairvoyant, the husband recognised him as a man he had seen in a Londoncoffee-house on the eve of his departure for America. According to the captain,the man had spoken to him, asked him why he had not written to his wife, andthen vanished into the crowd . . .The clairvoyant’s power of ‘projecting’ himself across the Atlantic brings tomind similar stories of Swedenborg bringing messages from the dead. Hisappearance in a London coffeehouse has dozens of parallels in Phantasms of theLiving, compiled in the 1880s by members of the Society for Psychical Research.What rings totally false here is the information that the captain spoke to himand explained why he had failed to write to his wife. There are hundreds ofrecorded cases of ‘projection’, but in very few (I can recall only one1) doesthe ‘phantasm’ actually talk to anybody. When we learn that these eventssupposedly took place in 1740—the year Jung-Stilling was born—it becomes clearthat, even if basically true, the story had probably been ‘improved’ in thetelling. Mrs Crowe had no way of knowing that the story failed to conform to thegeneral pattern of ‘phantasms of the living’ because in her day there had notbeen enough research for the pattern to emerge.In view of this difficulty, Mrs Crowe did remarkably well, and her book deservedits high reputation. Most of her conjectures would do credit to a moderninvestigator, and, in many ways, her ‘credibility’ was often far ahead of hertime. She cites a story from another early researcher, Joseph Ennemoser:‘It appears that Van Helmont, having asserted that it was possible for a man toextinguish the life of a an animal by the eye alone (oculis intentis), Rousseau,the naturalist, repeated the experiment when in the East, and in this mannerkilled several toads; but on a subsequent occasion, whilst trying the sameexperiment at Lyons, the animal, on finding it could not escape, fixed its eyesimmovably on him, so that he fell into a fainting fit, and was thought to bedead . . .’This is the kind of tale that makes us smile sarcastically; we know that thesestories of the hypnotic power of snakes and other creatures are old wives’tales. Yet we have already noted the recent investigations of Dr Ferenc AndrásVölgyesi, who devoted many years to studying hypnosis in men and animals, andarrived at some interesting conclusions. He observed—and photographed—dozens ofcases in which snakes ‘fascinated’ rabbits or rats and then ate them. He alsoobserved many cases of ‘battles of wills’ between the snake and its potentialvictims—his book contains photographs of a giant anaconda ‘fascinating’ a rat,and a python immobilising a hare. Another shows a battle of wills between abird, the cucullus senegalensis, and a rattlesnake. He states: ‘The battle,which begins with a mutual fixing of the gaze, usually ends in victory for thebird.’ Another photograph shows a toad winning a battle of wills with a cobra.Nor let us forget his description of the battle between two lizards; theyconfronted one another for about ten minutes, gazing intently at one another (asMrs Crowe says, oculis intentis), then one slowly ate the other, which remainedimmobile. Van Helmont’s tale about killing animals with the gaze may be anexaggeration, but it is based on an observed reality.As we have seen, there is a great deal in the literature of hypnosis to supportMrs Crowe’s view that it involves the deliberate use of some mental force. Wemay recall that in 1885 the French psychologist Pierre Janet observed theexperiments of a doctor named Gibert, who could induce hypnosis in a patientcalled Leonie by merely thinking about her, and summon her from the other sideof Le Havre by the same means. In the 1890s, Dr Paul Joire caused blindfoldedand hypnotised patients to obey his mental commands, and the same kind ofexperiments were repeated in the 1920s by the Russian scientist L. L. Vasiliev,who described them in a book called Experiments in Distant Influence; it leavesno possible doubt that some kind of mental force can be exercised at a distance.What fascinated Mrs Crowe was the clear implication that human powers are fargreater than we realise. If people can leave their bodies and witness thingsthat are going on elsewhere, if a hypnotised subject can describe things thatare happening in the street, if a girl can turn into a human magnet, if a mancan dream accurately about the future—then materialistic science must be somehowfundamentally mistaken about our human limitations. Mrs Crowe had translated TheSeeress of Prevorst, and it was perfectly clear to her that unless Kerner was anout-and-out liar, then something very queer was going on. This was not thesecond-hand reporting of spooks and spectres, as in Jung-Stilling’sPneumatology; this was first-hand reporting by a man who had no reason to lie ordeceive himself. Kerner described—and Mrs Crowe cites in The Night Side ofNature—how Friederike had awakened one night crying ‘Oh, God!’, and how a doctorwho was sitting near the corpse of her father, many miles away, clearly heardthe exclamation, and rushed into the room to see if the corpse had come to life.This was not a question of spirits; it was some curious power possessed byFriederike herself. And while such powers seem to be beyond the control of theindividual who exercises them, Mrs Crowe could see that there is no earthlyreason why this should always be so. That is why the hard-headed Victoriansfound her book so exciting. Their explorers were penetrating new continents,their railways were stretching to the ends of the earth, their industries werecreating new wealth, their science was uncovering the secrets of the universe.And if Mrs Crowe was correct, a new science of the ‘supernatural’ woulddemonstrate that man himself was a far more extraordinary creature then he hadever suspected. Her book was not a morbid collection oftales-to-make-the-flesh-creep, but a work of buoyant optimism about humanpotentialities.Unfortunately, a Victorian lady novelist was hardly the person to persuadescientists that they were ignoring an important subject. The Victorians hadfought hard for their intellectual freedom. Witches were still being executed inthe 1690s; as late as the 1750s, the Church forced the great naturalist Buffonto withdraw his statement that the earth was a fragment of the sun, and thatfossils were the remains of primitive ancestors of present-day creatures. By1800, intellectuals were utterly sick of the authority the Church had beenexercising for centuries. They longed to see the downfall of theseecclesiastical bullies. So every time someone dared to challenge theintellectual authority of the Church, cheers echoed throughout Europe. In 1830,two years after The Night Side of Nature was published, the German theologianLudwig Feuerbach produced a book, Thoughts on Death and Immortality, in which hedismissed the idea of a personal God, and jeered at the desire for immortalityas selfish stupidity. Feuerbach was persecuted by the police and forced to giveup his post at the university. Ten years later, Feuerbach published a far moreradical book, The Essence of Christianity, which landed like a bombshell andfrightened even the freethinkers; he declared that God and immortality weredangerous delusions, and that man has to learn to live in the present instead ofwasting his time dreaming about a non-existent heaven. (The book had a deepinfluence on Karl Marx, who expressed its basic message in the phrase ‘Religionis the opium of the people’.) In his novel Green Heinrich, the Swiss poetGottfried Keller describes Feuerbach as ‘a magician in the shape of a bird whosang God out of the hearts of thousands’. And the same book has a portrait of aschoolteacher who has lost his job because he is an atheist, but who travelsaround Germany exclaiming: ‘Isn’t it a joy to be alive?’, and ‘forevermarvelling at the glory of being free from the encumbrance’ of God.This is why the scientists and philosophers were not willing to pay attention tothe evidence for the ‘supernatural’. They were too delighted to see the Churchgetting a black eye, and had no intention of letting religion sneak in again bythe back door. So when Catherine Crowe began her book by admitting that shewanted to prove the reality of man’s immortal soul, most of them read nofurther. Whether Mrs Crowe intended it or not, she was giving aid and comfort tothe enemy.In fact, in the year The Night Side of Nature was published, this particularenemy was preparing to mount a full-frontal assault . . . With the wisdom ofhindsight, we can see that the most interesting and significant pages of TheNight Side of Nature are those that concern the haunting of a house owned by anindustrialist named Joshua Proctor. Here Mrs Crowe presents the kind ofcarefully documented account that would be the aim of the later investigators ofthe Society for Psychical Research. This is the true stuff of psychicalresearch. She prefaces the account with a letter from Joshua Proctor to herself,vouching for the accuracy of the details of the report that follows.The haunted house was a millhouse; it had been built only forty years earlier,in 1800. The newly-built Newcastle and Shields railway passed overhead on aviaduct. In June 1840, news reached the outside world that the Proctorfamily—who were Quakers—had been disturbed by knocking noises, and had seen someunpleasant things. A surgeon named Edward Drury, who practised in Sunderland,heard about the haunting from a local farmer. Dr Drury was sceptical about suchmatters. Nevertheless, he had been fascinated by the account of a famouspoltergeist haunting at Epworth, in the rectory of the Rev. Samuel Wesley,grandfather of the founder of Methodism (see Chapter 6[../Text/11_chapter06.html]). This spook, known as Old Jeffrey, had banged andgroaned around the rectory for two months in 1716. There were sounds of heavybreathing, breaking glass, footsteps, and various unidentifiable noises. TheRev. Samuel noticed that the disturbances seemed in some way connected with his19-year-old daughter Hetty, who trembled in her sleep before the sounds began.The scientist Joseph Priestley had investigated the case, and decided it was ahoax. Dr Drury was inclined to agree with him; so when he heard of the‘haunting’ of Willington Mill, he wrote to its owner, Joshua Proctor, offeringto ‘unravel the mystery’ (that is, expose the hoaxer). Mr Proctor repliedpolitely, saying that he and his family were going away on a visit on the dateMr Drury had suggested; one of his employees was going to act as caretaker whilethey were away. Nevertheless, if Drury wanted to come and stay overnight, he waswelcome.Dr Drury decided to take a friend along for moral support. He also took a braceof pistols, intending to allow one of them to fall on the floor, as if byaccident, to deter any practical joker. But when he arrived, he found thatJoshua Proctor had returned—alone—from his holiday, and Mr Proctor was soobviously an honest man that Drury decided the ‘accident’ was unnecessary.What happened to Edward Drury that night convinced him completely of the realityof the supernatural. It also gave him such a fright that he went partially deafin one ear and suffered a temporary breakdown in health. He seems to have beentoo shattered to describe what he had seen immediately afterwards, but hepromised to write Mr Proctor a letter with a full account. This letter waswritten on July 13, 1840, ten days after his night in the haunted millhouse.He arrived with his friend, T. Hudson, and was made welcome by Mr Proctor, whoshowed him over the house. At eleven o’clock, Dr Drury and Mr Hudson settleddown on the third-story landing outside the ‘haunted room’. (Although he says he‘expected to account for any noises that he might hear in a philosophicalmanner’, he presumably decided that discretion was the better part of valour.)About an hour later, they heard pattering noises, ‘as if a number of people werepattering with their bare feet’. Then there was a knocking sound from thefloorboards at their feet, as if someone was rapping with his knuckles. Afterthis, they heard a ‘hollow cough’ from the haunted room, but seem to havedecided not to investigate. Then they heard a rustling noise, as if someone wascoming upstairs.At a quarter to one, feeling cold, Dr Drury said he thought he would retire tobed; Mr Hudson said he intended to stay up until dawn. Drury looked at hiswatch, and noted the time. As he looked up, he saw a closet door open, and ‘thefigure of a female, attired in greyish garments, with the head incliningdownwards, and one hand pressed upon the chest, as if in pain’ walking towardshim. Mr Hudson was fast asleep, but was awakened by Drury’s ‘awful yell’. Druryrushed at the figure, ‘but instead of grasping it, I fell upon my friend, and Irecollected nothing distinctly for nearly three hours afterwards. I have sincelearnt that I was carried down stairs in an agony of fear and terror.’Mrs Crowe not only publishes the full correspondence between Dr Drury and JoshuaProctor, but an account by a local historian, another by the owner of a localjournal, and descriptions by four other people who had seen the ghost. In fact,there seemed to be more than one; there was also a man in a surplice who glidedacross a second-floor room at a distance of a few feet from the floor. The localhistorian adds to his account the information that Mr Proctor has recentlydiscovered an old book that states that similar hauntings had taken place in anolder house that had been built on the same spot two hundred years before. MrsCrowe ends her account by mentioning that Mr Proctor has now decided to leavethe house, and turn it into ‘small tenements’ for his workpeople.What makes this report so interesting is that the case resembles in so manyrespects the ‘haunting’ that would occur eight years later in Hydesville, NewYork, and that would launch the Spiritualism movement of the 19th century. InWillington, as in Hydesville, there was a mixture of ‘poltergeist’ phenomena andthe more conventional type of haunting. If Dr Drury had shown the same kind ofcourage and curiosity shown later by Mrs Margaret Fox at Hydesville, it seemshighly probable that the Spiritualist movement would have been launched tenyears earlier in England.The Hydesville affair began on March 31, 1848, in a wooden frame house inhabitedby a Methodist farmer named James D. Fox, his wife Margaret, and their twodaughters, Margaretta, aged 14, and Kate, aged 12. Hydesville is a smalltownship not far from Rochester, New York. James Fox had moved into the house inthe previous December. A previous tenant, Michael Weekman, had been disturbed byvarious loud knocks, for which he could find no cause.The Fox family was also kept awake by various banging noises in the last days ofMarch 1848; but since it was a windy month, they were not unduly disturbed. OnFriday March 31, the family decided to retire early to make up for lost sleep.Mr Fox went round the house checking the shutters and sashes. The childrenobserved that when he shook the sashes, to see how loose they were, bangingnoises seemed to reply like an echo.The whole family slept in two beds in the same room. Just before the parentscame to bed, the rapping noises started again. Kate said cheekily: ‘MrSplitfoot, do as I do’, and began snapping her fingers. To the amazement of thegirls, the raps imitated her. Margaret interrupted: ‘Do as I do’, and began toclap. Again, the sounds imitated her. Remembering that the next day would beApril the first, the children decided that someone was playing a joke. In heraccount of what happened, Mrs Fox wrote:‘I then thought I could put a test that no one in the place could answer. Iasked the noise to rap my different children’s ages, successively. Instantly,each one of my children’s ages was given correctly, pausing between themsufficiently long to individualise them until the seventh [child], at which alonger pause was made, and then three more emphatic little raps were given,corresponding to the age of the little one that died . . .’Now rather frightened—this was evidently no joke—Mrs Fox asked if it was a humanbeing who was making the raps; there was no reply. ‘Is it a spirit? If it is,make two raps.’ Two thunderous bangs followed, so loud that the house shook. Sheasked if it was an ‘injured spirit’, and again the bangs shook the house.Further questioning revealed that the knocker was a man who died at the age of31, that he had been murdered in the house, and that he had a wife and fivechildren. Mrs Fox asked if the spirit had any objection to her calling in theneighbours; the raps replied: ‘No.’The Foxes summoned in about fourteen neighbours. One of these was a man calledWilliam Duesler, who assured his own wife that the whole thing was ridiculousand that there could be nothing mysterious about the noises. When he got there,some of the neighbours were too nervous to go into the bedroom, but Duesler wasnot worried. He went and sat on the bed, and was astonished when Mrs Fox’squestions were answered with a rapping noise that made the bed vibrate. (Laterwriters were to insist that the two children made all the noises by crackingtheir joints; but it is hard to see how the cracking of joints could make thehouse shake and cause a bed to vibrate.)Duesler took up the questioning of the ‘spirit’. By a code of knocks, heestablished that the entity was a man who had been murdered in the house, apedlar named Charles B. Rosma, who had been attacked for the $500 he carried.The murder had taken place five years earlier, and had been committed by the manwho was then the tenant of the house, a Mr Bell. A maid named Lucretia Pulverlater confirmed that a pedlar had spent the night in the house, and that she hadbeen sent home; when she returned the next day, the pedlar had gone.As news of these amazing occurrences spread throughout the community, hundredsof people came to the house. On Sunday, April 2, Duesler learned from themurdered man that his body had been buried in the cellar. This seemed to offer amethod of verification, and James Fox and his neighbours took shovels to thecellar—which had an earth floor—and proceeded to dig. At a depth of three feetthey encountered water, and abandoned the attempt. But in July, when the waterhad gone down, they dug again, and at a depth of five feet found a plank;underneath this, in quicklime, there was some human hair and a few bones.Mr Bell, on being heard that he had been accused of murder by a ghost,indignantly denied it, and produced a testimonial to his good character from hisnew neighbours in Lyon, New York. The spirit had already prophesied that themurderer would never be brought to justice.In his account of the case in Modern Spiritualism, the sceptical Frank Podmorecomments: ‘No corroborative evidence of the supposed murder, or even of theexistence of the man supposed to have been murdered, was ever obtained.’ Thiswas written in 1902. Two years later, in November 1904, a wall in the cellar ofthe Fox house collapsed, revealing another wall behind it. Digging between thetwo walls uncovered a skeleton and a pedlar’s tin box. It looked as if someonehad dug up the body from its original grave and interred it next to the wall,then built another wall to confuse searchers.In those days immediately after the first manifestations, a committee was set upto collect the statements of witnesses. Not all the investigators were convincedthat the sounds had a supernatural origin; but no one suggested that the Foxfamily could be responsible. With the family all together in the same room, itwas obviously impossible that either the parents or the children could becausing the bangs.What everyone soon noticed was that nothing happened unless the children were inthe house—particularly Kate. A committee of sceptical Rochester citizens came tothe house to investigate; they agreed that Margaret was certainly notresponsible. A second, a third investigation produced the same result. Thechildren were stripped and searched to see if they had some mechanical devicefor producing the sounds; there was nothing. They were made to stand on pillowswith their ankles tied; still the raps occurred.The children were separated; Kate was sent to stay with her elder sister Leah inRochester, and Margaretta with her brother David in Auburn. The ‘spirits’followed them both. Rapping noises were heard, and people felt themselvestouched by invisible hands. In Leah’s house, a lodger called Calvin Brown took amildly satirical attitude towards the spirit, and it began to persecute him,throwing things at him. Mrs Fox’s cap was pulled off and the comb pulled out ofher hair. When members of the family knelt to pray, pins were jabbed into them.In brother David’s boarding house, similar things were happening. It was clearthat the murdered pedlar was not responsible for all this—he was back in theHydesville house, making terrifying gurgling noises and sounds like a body beingdragged across the floor. Mrs Fox’s hair turned white. One spirit whocommunicated with Kate claimed to be a dead relative named Jacob Smith. SisterLeah Fish discovered that she could also communicate with the spirits, and beganproducing messages. One 16-year-old girl named Harriet Bebee, who visited thehouse in Auburn and witnessed the rapping noises, returned to her home milesaway and found that the noises had followed her.The Fox family moved to Rochester, but the manifestations continued. Sometimesthe bangs were so loud that they could be heard miles away. Poltergeists hadapparently taken over from the original ‘injured spirit’. One day, a visitornamed Isaac Post started asking the spirit questions, and was answered by athunderous barrage of knocks. Then, by means of an alphabetical code, the‘spirit’ spelled out a message: ‘Dear friends, you must proclaim this truth tothe world. This is the dawning of a new era; you must not try to conceal it anylonger. God will protect you and good spirits will watch over you.’ And nowbegan a series of manifestations that were to become typical of ‘Spiritualism’.1Tables moved and rapped with their legs; musical instruments were played byunseen fingers, objects moved round the room. The ‘spirits’ intimated that theywould prefer to manifest themselves in the dark—which confirmed the sceptics intheir opinion. But other believers decided it was time to put the ‘spirit”sinjunction into operation and ‘proclaim this truth to the world’. On November14, 1849, the first Spiritualist meeting took place in the Corinthian hall inRochester.In his account of the haunting of Willington Mill, the local historian, M. A.Richardson, had remarked:‘Were we to draw an inference from the number of cases of reported visitationsfrom the invisible world that have been made public of late, we might be led toimagine that the days of supernatural agency were about to recommence, and thatghosts and hobgoblins were about to resume their sway over the fears ofmankind.’For 1840, that was a remarkably perceptive observation. Whether it was merelydue to improved communications and the increase in the number of newspapers, itdoes seem clear that there was an apparent increase in ghostly manifestations atabout this period. In retrospect, it looks oddly as if the ‘spirits’ had decidedthat the time had come to make themselves noticed. Of course, there had beensuch manifestations for centuries—the Elizabethan astrologer Dr John Dee devoteda large book to an account of his communications with spirits through the agencyof a ‘scryer’ (or, as they later came to be called, medium) called EdwardKelley. Cases like the Epworth poltergeist, the Stockwell poltergeist (describedby Mrs Crowe), the Cock Lane ghost and the phantom drummer of Tedworth hadaroused widespread excitement and been the subject of contemporary pamphlets. In1847, a young American shoemaker named Andrew Jackson Davis was placed underhypnosis and wrote an extraordinary and erudite work called The Principles ofNature which subsequently became a literary sensation. In this remarkable book,Davis prophesies that ‘the truth about spirits will ere long present itself inthe form of a living demonstration, and the world will hail with delight theushering in of that era when the interiors of men will be opened’. Within fouryears of its publication, Spiritualism had spread across America and wassweeping Europe.For whatever reason, the Fox sisters began a Spiritualist explosion. Peoplediscovered that all they had to do was to sit in a darkened room, preferablywith a ‘medium’ present—someone who had already established a communication withthe spirits—and the manifestations would usually follow immediately. Noapparatus was required, except possibly a few musical instruments. In theRochester area, more than a hundred ‘mediums’ appeared in the year 1850. InBuffalo, New York, two brothers and a sister named Davenport attended a seanceat which the Fox sisters produced their manifestations, and decided to try itthemselves—in fact, inexplicable raps and bangs had sounded in their home in theyear 1846, two years before the Hydesville manifestations. When Ira, William andElizabeth Davenport sat in a darkened room, with their hands on a tabletop, thetable began to move, raps were heard all over the room, and when Ira picked up apencil his hand began to write automatically. A few nights later, with witnessespresent, all three children were seen to levitate into the air. At their fifth‘seance’, Ira was instructed—by means of raps—to fire a pistol in the corner ofthe room. As it exploded, it was taken from his hand, and by the light of theflash, a figure of a man was seen holding it. He vanished a moment later, andthe pistol fell to the floor. The man introduced himself—through the code ofraps—as John King; he was one of the first examples of a ‘control’ (or master ofceremonies), who acted as intermediary between the medium and the ‘spirits’.‘John King’ was soon taking over the brothers directly and speaking throughtheir mouths. The Davenport brothers went on to become even more famous than theFox sisters.In Dover, Ohio, a well-to-do farmer named Jonathan Koons discovered his owntalents as a medium by sitting in a dark room and going into a trance. The‘spirits’ who spoke through him told him that all his eight children were giftedmediums. They instructed him to build a special house made of logs, sixteen feetby twelve, to be used exclusively for spiritualist activities. There were largenumbers of musical instruments—drums, triangles, tambourines, a banjo, anaccordion, a harp, a guitar, and so on. The room was dimly lighted by sheets ofwet paper smeared with phosphorus. When the mediums—usually Koons and his18-year-old son Nahum—were seated at a small table—with the audience onbenches—Koons would play the violin, and the spirits would soon join in,producing the effect of a full orchestra. Witnesses also speak of a heavenlychoir joining in. The racket was impressive, and could be heard a mile away. Avoice would then deliver a homily, using a speaking trumpet, which floated inthe air. A spirit hand floated round the room, touching people and shaking theirhands. People came from all over the county to witness these marvels, and thespirits impressed everyone by producing information about strangers that none ofthe audience could have known.This was, in fact, one of the most convincing things about the ‘spirits’; theyseemed to have access to all kinds of information. In Boston, the wife of anewspaper editor, Mrs W. R. Hayden, startled the wife of the Englishmathematician, Augustus de Morgan, by giving her detailed messages from deadfriends about whom she could not possibly have known. The result was that Mrs deMorgan invited her to England, where she held seances under ‘test conditions’ inthe de Morgans’ home. She was loudly ridiculed by the English newspapers, whowere convinced that this latest American craze must be based on fraud anddeception (which the British were too sensible to swallow), but she convincedmost of those who actually saw her. And respectable members of the Britishmiddle classes who tried ‘table-turning’ to while away the long evenings wereamazed to discover that it actually worked. One journalist wrote a few yearslater: ‘In those days you were invited to “Tea and Table Moving” as a newexcitement, and made to revolve with the family like mad round articles offurniture.’ Even Queen Victoria and Prince Albert tried it at Osborne, and thetable moved so convincingly that the queen had no doubt whatever that notrickery was involved—she decided that the answer must lie in some form ofelectricity or magnetism.The French were more than prepared to adopt this new form of entertainment, forhalf a century of controversy about Mesmer—who had taught that healing,clairvoyance and other such mysteries were due to a mysterious force called‘Animal Magnetism’—had accustomed them to strange phenomena; by 1851,table-turning had become the latest craze. And the spirits soon made a highlyinfluential convert. He was a 50-year-old educationalist namedDenizard-Hyppolyte-Leon Rivail, who was to become famous under the name AllanKardec. Rivail had been a pupil of the celebrated educator Pestalozzi, and hehad opened his own school at the age of 24. He had written popular books onarithmetic, grammar, spelling, how to calculate in your head, and educationalreform, and given immensely successful courses of free lectures on astronomy,chemistry, physics and anatomy. He was also an enthusiastic student ofphrenology and Animal Magnetism.It was in May 1855 that Rivail attended a hypnotic session with a certain MadameRoger, who was placed in a trance by her ‘magnetiser’, M. Fortier, and was ableto read minds and perform other puzzling feats. There Rivail met a certainMadame Plainemaison, who told him that even stranger phenomena were taking placeregularly at her house in the rue Grange-Bateliere. Rivail agree to go, and wasamazed by what he saw. The tables did more than merely ‘turn’; they also jumpedand ran about the room. The disciple of Mesmer felt that these phenomenachallenged the powers of reason to which he had devoted his life, and hedetermined to try to get to the bottom of it. At Madame Plainemaison’s, he met aman named Baudin, who told him that his two daughters practised automaticwriting. The young ladies seem to have discovered their powers accidentally, inthe course of entertaining their friends with table-turning; they were, says onecommentator, ‘of a worldly and frivolous disposition’. This did not deter theserious-minded Rivail, who proceeded to ask the table major philosophicalquestions. Asked if mankind would ever understand the first principles of theuniverse, it replied, ‘No. There are things that cannot be understood by man inthis world.’ When Rivail asked if matter had always existed, the table replied(perhaps a trifle wearily), ‘God only knows.’It was obvious to Rivail that the entities who were communicating were genuinespirits, not the unconscious minds of the young ladies. (Even in those days, theconcept of the unconscious was accepted.) In fact, the communicators identifiedthemselves as ‘spirits of genii’, and said that some of them (but not all) hadbeen the spirits of those who had been alive on earth.With excitement, Rivail realised that this material had an impressiveinner-consistency, and that the total pattern revealed a philosophical schemethat embraced the whole universe. Other friends who had been collecting‘automatic scripts’—including the playwright Sardou—handed over their ownmaterial to Rivail—more than fifty notebooks. And Rivail was told to bring allthis material together into a book, which should be called The Spirits’ Book.The spirits even gave Rivail the pseudonym under which he should publish thework: Allan Kardec; both of these names—according to the spirits—were names hehad borne in previous incarnations.The message of The Spirits’ Book is easily summarised. Man is a fourfold being,made up of body, ‘vital principle’ (aura), intelligent soul and spiritualsoul—the divisions we have already encountered in the Seeress of Prevorst.Spirits are intelligent beings, who constitute the ‘population of the universe’.Man is a spirit enclosed in a physical body. The destiny of all spirits is toevolve towards perfection. There are three basic categories of spirit: the ‘lowspirits’, who are trapped in materiality, the ‘second degree spirits’, whosemoral nature has evolved to the point where they experience only a desire forgood, and the ‘perfect spirits’, who have reached the peak of their evolution.The ‘low spirits’ range from evil spirits who are activated by malice to mere‘boisterous spirits’ who enjoy getting into mischief. These latter are alsoknown as poltergeists. After death, a spirit spends some time in the spiritworld, and is then reincarnated on earth or some other world. The purpose ofearthly life is to enable the spirit to evolve. To some extent, the spirit isable to choose the trials it will undergo in its next life. (This means that itis pointless to bemoan our lot, since we have chosen it ourselves.)The Spirits’ Book appeared in 1856, and created a sensation. Kardec became thefounder-figure of the French spiritualist movement, and his works attainedimmense influence. But he died of a heart attack only thirteen years after thebook was published, at the age of 65, and his influence was soon being widelyquestioned by the movement. Rivail was totally committed to the doctrine ofreincarnation, the slow perfection of the spirit through a series of rebirths,which can be traced back to ancient India. But most of the ‘spirits’ who spokethrough mediums at seances had nothing to say about reincarnation. So Rivail wasinclined to be critical about trance mediums, while the trance mediums and theirfollowers denounced Rivail as a dogmatic old man. After Rivail’s death, hisinfluence waned, and within a few years he was half-forgotten.Now in Paris, in 1860, there was a particularly violent poltergeist in the Ruedes Noyers; it smashed every window in the place, hurled all kinds of objectsaround the house (including many which the occupants had never seen before), andfinally drove the unfortunate people out of the house. Rivail decided to try tofind out what exactly had happened. His medium’s ‘control’ (the spirit who actsas master of ceremonies) explained that the disturbances were the work of amischievous spirit. And, at the request of the control (a spirit called SaintLouis), the poltergeist of the Rue des Noyers was summoned. He appeared to be ina bad temper, and asked irritably: ‘Why do you call me? Do you want to have somestones thrown at you?’ Rivail now asked the spirit: ‘Was there anyone in the Ruedes Noyers who helped you play tricks on the inmates?’ Certainly, replied thespirit, it had had an excellent ‘instrument’. It added, ‘For I am merry and liketo amuse myself sometimes.’ Who was it? Rivail asked. ‘A maidservant.’‘Was she unaware you were making use of her?’‘Oh yes, poor girl—she was the most frightened of them all.’Rivail asked how the spirit managed to throw various objects about the place,and received the interesting answer: ‘I helped myself through the electricnature of the girl, joined to my own . . . thus we were able to transport theobjects between us.’Rivail asked the spirit who it was. It replied that it had been dead about fiftyyears, and had been a rag-and-bone-man. People used to make fun of him becausehe drank too much, and this was why he decided to play tricks on the inhabitantsof the Rue des Noyers. He indignantly denied that he had done these things outof malice; it was merely his way of amusing himself.This spirit seemed to belong to a class described in The Spirits’ Book: ‘Theyare ignorant, mischievous, unreasonable, and addicted to mockery. They meddlewith everything and reply to every question without paying attention to thetruth.So, according to Kardec, poltergeists are mischievous spirits who draw theirenergy from certain ‘vulnerable’ human beings.In all but one respect, Kardec’s ‘spirit teaching’ agreed basically with thoseof most other spiritualists since Swedenborg; but that one aspect,reincarnation, was to prove a source of severe contention within the Frenchspiritualist movement. The Spirits’ Book had already been anticipated by a workcalled Arcanes de la vie future dévoilée—Secrets of the Future Life Unveiled, byAlphonse Cahagnet, published in 1848 (and a second and third volume later).Cahagnet was a cabinet maker who had become fascinated by ‘somnambulism’(hypnotism) in his mid-30s; he placed various subjects in a hypnotic trance—themost impressive being a woman called Adèle Maginot—and recorded what they toldhim of life after death. Adèle was so remarkable because her messages from thedead—and sometimes from living people who had disappeared—were so full ofconvincing evidence. Cahagnet started a journal called The SpiritualistMagnetiser, and this was later transformed into The Spiritualist Revue, editedby Z. Piérart. But Cahagnet, who was a follower of Swedenborg, did not believein reincarnation. And the French spiritualist movement was soon split by abitter war of words between the followers of Cahagnet and the followers ofKardec. Kardec was critical of trance mediums—like Adéle—because they hadnothing to say about reincarnation, and Cahagnet and his followers regardedautomatic writing with suspicion and disdain. But Kardec, who had heartproblems, died in 1869, only thirteen years after The Spirits’ Book waspublished, while Cahagnet lived and flourished until 1885, publishing many moreinfluential books. So it was Kardec’s version of spiritualism that graduallyfaded away as the movement became increasingly powerful. It was only in Brazil—acountry whose witch-doctors frequently called on the spirits for magicalaid—that Kardec’s version of spiritualism took root, and where it stillflourishes today as one of the country’s major religions. We shall examine thisat length in Chapter 9 [../Text/14_chapter09.html].It may be as well, at this point, to pause and ask the question: What does itall mean? There is something about ‘spiritualism’ that is peculiarly irritating.It is one thing to accept that some people possess strange powers ofclairvoyance, and quite another to swallow ‘spirit teachings’ that sound likethe ramblings of an uninspired Sunday school teacher. It is not that thedoctrines of Swedenborg or Kardec are in themselves unacceptable. The notionthat man possesses a ‘vital body’, an astral body and an ego-body seemsreasonable enough; some may even learn, through self-observation, to distinguishbetween the promptings of the ‘low self’ and the detached observations of somehigher part of us that looks down ironically on our sufferings and humiliations.But when Kardec tells us that God created spirits, and then set them the task ofevolving towards perfection, it sounds boringly abstract. Why did God bother tocreate spirits in the first place? Why did he not create them perfect in thefirst place? And surely spirits ought to have something better to do than tocommunicate with their living relatives through ‘mediums’ and deliveranti-climactic messages about the joys of the afterlife and the trivial problemsof the living? If we compare the revelations of spiritualism with those ofscience or philosophy, or the visions of the great mystics, they seem oddlybanal . . .This explains why spiritualism aroused such instant hostility among scientistsand philosophers. Spiritualism was like a volcanic explosion of belief; thescientists replied with a blast of scepticism that was like cold water. And thecombination of boiling lava and cold water produced an enormous cloud of steamthat obscured everything. It was not that most scientists disbelieved theevidence: they refused even to look at it. T. H. Huxley expressed the generalfeeling when he remarked: ‘It may all be true, for anything that I know to thecontrary, but really I cannot get up interest in the subject.’Such an attitude can hardly be defended as scientific. For anyone who has anhour to spare, the evidence is seen to be overwhelming. There arehundreds—thousands—of descriptions of out-of-the-body experiences, ofpoltergeists, of ‘apparitions of the dead’, of accurate glimpses of the future.Any reasonable person ought to be prepared to come to terms with these, not todismiss them with the comment: ‘I really cannot get up any interest in thesubject.’Can we come to terms with them without making any commitment to life-after-deathor the existence of ‘spirits’? Just about. Consider, for example, the hauntingof Willington Mill. One interesting point that emerged was that the maleapparition walked across the room several feet above the ground, at the level ofthe window-sill. This suggests that it was walking on a floor that had now beendemolished. And we know that the millhouse was built on the site of an olderhouse. It looks as if the ‘tape recording’ theory (see p. 211[../Text/12_chapter07.html#page_211]) can explain this particular ghost. We alsoobserve that the house was at the bottom of a valley, next to a stream, andtherefore almost certainly damp. T. C. Lethbridge suggested that ghosts are‘recordings’ on the electrical field of water, and are found most frequently indamp places . . .We may also note the comment of the local historian that although the mill wasbuilt around 1800, no haunting was recorded from that time until thedisturbances experienced by Mr Proctor’s family—a family of young children.Later in the 19th century, investigators of poltergeist phenomena observed thatchildren are usually present, and that one of them often seems to be the ‘focus’of the disturbance—indeed, we may recall that the Rev. Samuel Wesley noticedthat his daughter Hetty trembled in her sleep before ‘Old Jeffrey’ began bangingaround. Split-brain physiology has taught us that we have two people inside ourheads. Perhaps ‘Old Jeffrey’ was some kind of manifestation of Hetty Wesley’sunconscious mind or right brain?Thomson Jay Hudson has some surprising things to say about Spiritualism in TheLaw of Psychic Phenomena. He admits that the things that happen in the seanceroom are undeniable, but he claims they are not produced by the spirits of thedead. What produces the phenomena is ‘essentially a human intelligence, andneither rises above nor sinks below the ordinary intelligence of humanity’. Andthis is why spiritualism is so oddly boring and disappointing—because it is, asNietzsche would say, ‘human, all too human’. ‘. . . We have already seen whatremarkable powers the subjective mind possesses in certain lines of intellectualactivity, and with what limitations it is hedged about; and we find that theintellectual feats of mediums possess all the characteristics belonging tosubjective intelligence—the same wonderful powers and the same limitations,’It is a convincing theory, and surprisingly ‘modern’; in all the years since TheLaw of Psychic Phenomena appeared, nothing more plausible or ‘scientific’ hasbeen advanced. But does it really cover all the facts? Hudson’s solution to theproblem of spirits is that ‘the subjective mind of the medium, being controlledby suggestion, believes itself to be the spirit of any deceased person whosename is suggested’. But this fails to explain cases—like Swedenborg’s case ofthe ‘secret drawer’ mentioned in Chapter 3 [../Text/08_chapter03.html]—where themedium was able to produce information that was only known to the dead person.It seems, on the whole, more straightforward to accept the possibility of lifeafter death—or the spirit’s independence of the body—as a working hypothesis.The other major objection to spiritualism—that it somehow ‘reduces’ thespiritual to the material—was expressed by Dean Inge when he wrote: ‘The momentwe are asked to accept scientific evidence for spiritual truth, the allegedspiritual truth becomes neither spiritual nor true. It is degraded into an eventin the phenomenal world.’1 And, oddly enough, Rudolf Steiner agreed with him,remarking: ‘The spiritualists are the greatest materialists of all.’ This soundsbaffling, in view of the fact that Steiner not only accepted the reality of lifeafter death, but of reincarnation as well.The explanation is important, and accounts for the general feeling of hostilitythat is so often aroused by Spiritualism. One of Steiner’s basic doctrines wasthat ‘the supersensible world appears to us in such a way that it resembles ourperceptions of the sense world’.2 So that he says of Swedenborg:He was a man who, in the time of dawning natural science, had become accustomedonly to recognise the sensible, the visible . . . Since he insisted onrecognising as true only what he could calculate and perceive with his senses .. . he drew down the supersensible world into a lower sphere under the influenceof his habits of natural science.’3What Steiner is saying here is something that soon dawns on most readers ofaccounts of near-death experiences. Some find themselves walking towards acelestial city, some find themselves in flowery meadows, some find themselvesdrawn towards a heavenly gateway or a whirlpool of light. It looks as ifeveryone is interpreting the experience in terms of their own familiar concepts.Steiner is suggesting that visionaries like Swedenborg, who have caught aglimpse of the ‘supersensible world’, are bound to interpret it according totheir ingrained mental habits, and that this explains why the revelations ofspiritualism often seem slightly ludicrous.Oddly enough, Steiner thoroughly approved of Kardec, who obtained the materialfor his books from automatic writing. This clearly suggests that what Steinerdisliked so much about Spiritualism was its literal-mindedness—the trumpets andaccordions floating through the air, the tables dancing around the room, thespirits made of ectoplasm. His attitude could be compared to that of a Christianmystic who wishes to explain that heaven is not full of angels sitting around onclouds and playing harps.At the same time, there is bound to be an element of unfairness in such anattitude. Many mediums who started off by producing automatic writing laterbecame ‘voice mediums’, and some even ‘materialisation mediums’. It isimpossible to draw a sharp line between them. Steiner is not really criticisingSpiritualism; he is criticising spiritualists. Once we have grasped this, one ofthe major problems disappears—or at least, is revealed as a misunderstanding.It was a misunderstanding that caused a great deal of trouble and bitterness inthe early days of Spiritualism. It was useless for investigators like CatherineCrowe and Allan Kardec to demand a fair hearing for the ‘supernatural’;scientists and intellectuals felt they were being asked to swallow a farrago ofchildish nonsense. They pointed angrily at the Spiritualist churches that werespringing up all over America, and asked how anybody could be serious about areligion started by two silly girls. Their scepticism seemed to be justified inApril 1851, when a relative of the Fox family, a certain Mrs Norman Culver,announced in the New York Herald that Kate and Margaretta Fox had shown her howthey made the rapping noises with their knees and toes. This may or may not havebeen true. The girls—and their mother—had become celebrities, and spent a greatdeal of time travelling around the East coast giving demonstrations. Fate hadpromoted them from the boredom of small-town life in upper New York State to theequivalent of stardom. If the spirits were occasionally unco-operative, it wouldhave been surprising if they had not been tempted to do a little cheating. Whatseems perfectly clear is that the original phenomena—bangs that were strongenough to make the house vibrate—could not have been caused by cracking thejoints of the knees. Neither could Kate and Margaretta have answered all thequestions about the people in the room. The accusations of fraud were just onemore excuse for refusing to look dispassionately at the evidence.The real tragedy in all this was that the cloud of polemical steam obscured agreat deal of serious research into the paranormal, including the work ofReichenbach, Buchanan, Denton and Hudson himself. We can see, in retrospect,that the sceptics and the scientists did not behave too badly; they were oftennarrow-minded and impatient, but they did their best to be fair. It was thespiritualists themselves who were largely to blame for all the hostility. Theywere too gullible, too prone to accept any banal nonsense as a message from ‘theother side’. Hundreds of fake mediums took advantage of their credulity topractise barefaced impositions, and whenever one of them was caught in the act,scientists shook their heads wearily and made comparisons with the mediaevalwitchcraft phenomenon. Most of them had become too blasé even to say ‘I told youso’. Genuine mediums like the Davenport brothers did themselves no good byappearing in theatres and performing hair-raising feats of escapology that wouldhave done credit to Houdini. They allowed themselves to be tied so tight thatthe ropes cut into their flesh and caused bruises; but after a brief period in acabinet, they would step out with the ropes around their feet. ProfessorBenjamin Pierce, a member of an investigating committee, sat between them in thecabinet. As soon as the door was closed, a hand shot the bolt—both brothers weretrussed up like mummies—and briefly felt the professor’s face before going on tountie the brothers. Professor Loomis of the Georgetown Medical College admittedthat the manifestations were produced by a force with which he was unacquainted.But this kind of testimony meant nothing compared to the fact that the brothersappeared on the same bill with conjurors and acrobats.All this explains why so little was achieved by the most remarkable medium ofthe 19th century—perhaps of all time—Daniel Dunglas Home. Home retained hispowers for more than a quarter of a century, with the exception of a period ofone year when, as we shall see, the ‘spirits’ decided to punish him. Heperformed his astonishing feats in broad daylight. He caused heavy articles offurniture to float up to the ceiling; he himself floated out of one window andin at another; he washed his face in blazing coals; he could make himselfseveral inches taller at will. He was tested dozens of times by committees ofsceptics, and was never once caught out in anything that looked like fraud. Yetposterity remembers him chiefly as the man Dickens called ‘that scoundrel Home’,and about whom Robert Browning wrote a scurrilous poem called ‘Mr Sludge theMedium’.A typical Home seance is amusingly described by his biographer Jean Burton. Ittook place on an evening in January 1863, in the fashionable home of MadameJauvin d’Attainville, and the guests included Princess Metternich and herhusband, the Austrian ambassador. The guests—fifteen in all—sat at the table inthe magnificent second empire drawing room, while Home sat in an armchair threeor four yards away. When everyone was ready, he sat back in his chair, becamepaler, and went into a light trance. He asked ‘Bryan, are you there?’ (Bryanbeing his spirit guide). Sharp raps came from the table, the chandeliers beganto swing, and a chair moved of its own accord across the room and stopped infront of the guests. At the same moment, Princess Metternich screamed, as shefelt a powerful but invisible hand grip hers. Others also felt hands lightlytouching them. (All this was in a room ‘blazing with light’.) The tapestrytablecloth now rose into the air, and underneath it, something seemed to bemoving, like a hand or a small animal, towards them. This was too much for themen, most of whom were sceptics; Prince Metternich dived under the cloth andtried to grab the ‘creature’; there was nothing. One of the men pulled the clothaway, while others dived under the table to find the source of the raps; again,they were disappointed. As they scrambled out again, a hailstorm of rapssounded, as if in derision. The angry Prince Metternich was now convinced thatthey were coming from under the table, and scrambled underneath again. Rapssounded, and Metternich yelled indignantly: ‘No jokes, please!’ The companyassured him that they were not responsible.Apparently in a trance, Home pointed to a corsage of violets on the piano andasked that it should be brought over to them. The violets glided across thepiano, floated unsteadily across the room, and fell into the princess’s lap.Prince Metternich bounded forward and grabbed them, then proceeded to search forthe thread that he was convinced must be attached; he found nothing.In a faint voice, Home now demanded an accordion, a popular instrument of theperiod. When it came, the princess was asked to stand alone in the middle of theroom with the instrument held high above her head. As she stood there, her armin the air, an expression of astonishment crossed her face. There was a tug onthe accordion, and it proceeded to play, moving in and out. What impressedeveryone was that it was a fine performance, the playing so soft and melodiousthat it brought tears to the eyes of some of the audience. After that, anythingwould have been an anticlimax, so the seance finished. But, typically, the menbegan to speculate how it had been done; no one seemed to doubt that it had beensome form of conjuring trick; others spoke of electro-biology and mass hypnosis.The princess had to admit that she had no sensation of being hypnotised . . .Daniel Dunglas Home (he pronounced it Hume) was born near Edinburgh in March1833—his mother was a highlander and had a reputation as a ‘seer’. He wasprobably illegitimate—he liked to claim that his father was Lord Home. At theage of nine, he moved to America with an aunt, Mary Cook, and her husband. Hismother and ‘father’, and seven brothers and sisters, were already there. Danielsuffered from tuberculosis, and was subject to fainting fits—a typical ‘sicksensitive’. His closest friend was a boy called Edwin, and they went for longwalks in the woods of Connecticut. They made a boyish pact—that whoever diedfirst would show himself to the other. In 1846, when Daniel was thirteen, hetold his aunt and uncle that he had just seen Edwin standing at the foot of hisbed, and that the figure had made three circles in the air with his hand—whichDaniel took to mean that he had died three days ago. It proved to be true.There were no more supernatural experiences for another four years; then Homesaw a vision of his mother, and knew she was dead. Soon after that, he wasbrushing his hair when he saw, in the glass, a chair moving across the roomtowards him. He was terrified and rushed out of the house. In bed, he wasawakened by three loud bangs on the headboard. The next morning at breakfast,when his aunt was mildly teasing him about tiring himself out by attending toomany prayer meetings (Home was a religious young man), raps sounded from allover the table, and his alarmed aunt cried: ‘So you’ve brought the devil into myhouse, have you?’ and threw a chair at him. The Baptist minister was called into pray the devil away but had difficulty in making himself heard above the hailof knocks. Unaware that poltergeist phenomena are usually harmless, his auntrequested him to leave her house. So, at the age of seventeen, Home had to fendfor himself.But Home had such charm and gaiety that there were dozens of acquaintances whowere delighted to offer him hospitality. And the spirits gave him their fullsupport. He went easily into trance, and in that state talked fluently in Frenchand Italian—neither of them languages in which he had become proficient. Hecould not have chosen a better time to launch himself on the world, witheveryone in the United States talking about spirits. An evangelist named DrGeorge Bush—a professor of oriental languages—persuaded him that he ought tobecome a Swedenborgian and use his considerable preaching talent in the pulpit;Home agreed, then came back two days later to say that his dead mother hadexpressly forbidden it, telling him that he had a ‘more extended’ mission.Looked after by the ‘spirits’, and by kindly acquaintances, Home wandered aroundthrough New England, always a welcome guest in the homes of the well-off middleclasses; his pale good looks brought out the protectiveness in middle-agedladies. In Springfield, Massachusetts, he stayed at the home of a wealthycitizen named Rufus Elmers, and agreed to be investigated by a delegation fromHarvard, including the poet William Cullen Bryant. They, like many other‘delegations’ after them, had no doubt about the genuineness of the phenomena.The table not only ‘rapped’ and floated off the floor, but stood on two legslike a circus horse while three members of the committee sat on it and tried toforce it down again. The floor vibrated to shocks that were as powerful ascannon fire. All this took place in broad daylight, and members of the committeeheld Home’s hands and feet while most of the phenomena were taking place. Theirreport, entitled ‘The Modern Wonder’, concluded: ‘We know that we were notimposed upon nor deceived.’ Rufus Elmers was so impressed that he offered toadopt Home and make him his heir; Home declined with thanks.In August 1852, sitting in a circle, Home floated up to the ceiling—a feat thatbecame virtually his trademark. And his other phenomena continued to be almostas astonishing. Grand pianos would float across the room, bells would ring,cymbals clash, and there would be sounds of birdsong and assorted animal noises.One day, a table with a candle on it tilted at an angle, and the candle flamewent on burning at the same angle, as if it was still resting on a horizontalsurface. On another occasion, at the home of the Rev. S. B. Brittan, he wentinto a trance, and a voice announced: ‘Hannah Brittan here.’ Home began to wringhis hands, and for the next half hour, talked in a wild, distracted way aboutthe torments of hell. The Rev. Brittan was staggered, for he was certain that noone knew that the lady—a relative—had been a prey to religious mania, and haddied insane, obsessed by visions of eternal punishment. (On a subsequentappearance, Hannah Brittan told them that her present life was calm, peacefuland beautiful and that the torments of hell had been a delusion of herdistracted brain.)Most women adored Home, who was attentive and thoughtful—he loved sendingflowers on anniversaries. Men either liked him or loathed him. He had effeminatemanners, and many suspected he was homosexual. (For some odd reason, asurprising number of mediums are.) He was undoubtedly rather vain about his palegood looks and silky, auburn hair. He loved expensive clothes. He was anoutrageous snob, who took pleasure in being inaccessible. (He would onlycondescend to know people if introduced by a mutual acquaintance.) He would bemortally offended if anyone offered him money, and he resented being treated asa ‘performer’; as far as he was concerned, he was the social equal of anyone hemet, including kings. Yet he was becomingly modest about his achievement,insisting that he himself had nothing whatever to do with the phenómena. All hehad to do was to relax and put himself in the right mood (and ‘right’ isprobably here the operative word) and things simply happened.By 1855, Home’s consumptive cough had become so bad that his admirers decided heought to move to a healthier climate. For some unaccountable reason, he choseEngland. Admirers paid his passage, and with a crowd waving frantically, hesailed from Boston in March; he was just twenty-two.As usual, the spirits were looking after Home. In London, he moved into Cox’sHotel in Jermyn Street; the owner, William Cox, was a Spiritualist, and welcomedHome ‘as a father would a son’. So Home got free lodgings and an introduction tothe London society people who made regular use of the hotel. In no time at allhe was calling on marchionesses and baronesses. He went to visit the novelistLord Lytton, who made literary use of many of Home’s seance phenomena—a luminousform that dissolved into a globe, a disembodied hand, loud bangs, fierysparks—in his famous story ‘The Haunted and the Hunters’. But Lytton declined tobelieve spirits were responsible: he thought the phenomena were due to Home’sunconscious mind. He became a friend of the socialist Robert Owen, who was aconvert to spiritualism, and who introduced him to his old friend Lord HenryBrougham, a Voltairean sceptic. Brougham and Sir David Brewster had a privatesession with Home at which the table rose into the air and a bell floated acrossthe room. Brewster described these things in his diary and told them to friends,but later insisted that the table had only ‘appeared’ to rise, and that Home hadprobably moved the bell with some hidden apparatus. The resulting controversybrought Home much publicity, and provided the spiritualists with some excellentammunition to use against scientific dogmatism, since Brewster’s own diariesjustify Home.Elizabeth Barrett Browning called on Home, together with her husband Robert.Ghostly hands materialised, music sounded from the air, the table rapped loudlyand invisible spirits caressed them. Mrs Browning was totally convinced; herhusband—vigorous, sturdy, just over five feet tall—sat there scowling, andresolutely declined to accept the evidence of his eyes. Home became anunmentionable subject in the Browning household, and after his wife’s death,Browning wrote the flagrantly unfair ‘Mr Sludge the Medium’. He may have beenprejudiced by an episode that took place at another Home seance, when a detachedhand took up a garland of flowers and placed them on the poetess’s brow;Browning was jealous of his wife. Home made things worse by telling people thatBrowning had tried to place himself in the trajectory of the wreath so it wouldalight on his brow . . .By popular request of the English community, Home moved on to Florence. Therethe manifestations were stronger than ever. A grand piano floated up into theair and remained there while a countess played on it; a spirit conversed with aPolish princess in her own language; in a haunted convent, Home conversed withthe spirit of a monk—also a murderer—and caused his skinny, yellow hands tomaterialise. When the novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne came to Florence three yearslater, people were still talking about Home, and Hawthorne collected dozens ofwell-attested accounts of the phenomena. Hawthorne made the interesting andsignificant observation:‘These soberly attested incredibilities are so numerous that I forget ninetenths of them . . . they are absolutely proved to be sober facts by evidencethat would satisfy us of any other alleged realities; and yet I cannot force mymind to interest itself in them.’This is perhaps one of the most important comments ever made about Home or aboutspiritualism in general.Unfortunately, Home’s success began to go to his head. He was not a particularlystrong character, and being treated as a messenger from the gods would have beenenough to unbalance a far more independent nature. When he went to stay at thevilla of a titled Englishwoman who was separated from her husband, formeradmirers were scandalised—English self-control produces a morbid fascinationwith sexual scandal—and he began to sense a new atmosphere of hostility. He wasattacked on his way back to his hotel and slightly wounded—a sign that thespirits were becoming inefficient or lazy—and on February 10, 1856, the spiritstold him that his recent conduct was not worthy of a representative of the otherworld, and that his powers were about to leave him for a year. A Polish counthad invited him to Naples and Rome; Home felt obliged to admit to him that hispowers had deserted him. But his luck held; the count insisted that it made nodifference, and Home accompanied him to Naples. And in spite of the loss of hispowers, he remained a social lion. They came back, as the spirits hadprophesied, exactly one year to the day, on the stroke of midnight.By now Home was in Paris, and had taken the precaution of insuring himselfagainst the disapproval of the Church by becoming a Catholic. His fatherconfessor—recommended by the Pope himself—was less than enthusiastic about thereturn of the spirits, whom he assumed to be demons—but there was little hecould do about it. Neither would Home have wished it, for he was by now afavourite of the Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie. His luck arousedwidespread envy and hostility, but after the year of desertion by the spirits,he no longer allowed it to go to his head.After a tour of northern Europe, he returned to Rome, where he met and wooed abeautiful 17-year-old Russian countess named Sacha; they went to St Petersburg(together with the novelist Dumas) and her relatives organised a spectacularwedding. Home was received by the Russian royal family as cordially as byNapoleon III. Unfortunately, Sacha caught his tuberculosis, and died not longafter the birth of a son. At least her death was not a separation; Home was ableto keep in constant touch with her.In 1862 his luck again seemed to desert him. The police ordered him to leaveRome, declaring that he was a sorcerer (the spirits made things worse by rappingon the desk of the police chief). For the next four years he again became awanderer. In 1866, he met an effusive and vulgar old lady with a working-classaccent, Mrs Jane Lyon. who told him she wanted to adopt him as her son, andpresented him with numerous large cheques. Home changed his name to Home-Lyon.But the two were far from soulmates, and the relationship soon began todeteriorate badly—he found her boringly affectionate and she found him cold. Hehad a breakdown, and fled to various watering places to take a cure. When hereturned to London, he found that Mrs Lyon had transferred her allegiance to afemale medium, and was brooding on how to recover her money. She wanted backabout £30,000—only about half of what she had given him. She accused him ofextortion, and Home was arrested. At the trial in April 1868, she alleged thatshe had given him the money because he had brought her instructions to thateffect from her dead husband; Home’s case was that she had tried hard to seducehim after he became her ‘son’. Mrs Lyon was undoubtedly—as Homedeclared—vengeful and untruthful, and many of her lies were exposed in court.But a ‘spirit medium’ stood no chance of getting an unprejudiced trial; thejudge remarked that if everyone who gave money to a religious charity wasallowed to ask for it back, the result would be chaos; however, sincespiritualism was a fraud and a cheat he would make exception in the presentcase, Home was ordered to repay the money. The trial did Home immense damage,strengthening the impression already created by Browning’s ‘Mr Sludge’, that hewas a confidence trickster. But the notoriety had one advantage: a reading tourof England drew enormous audiences and helped to recoup his loss.During his ‘water cure’ in Malvern, Home had met a young aristocrat, Lord Adare,and during the next year or two he spent much time with him. In 1870, Adarepublished Experiences in Spiritualism with Mr D. D. Home, perhaps one of themost extraordinary and impressive books about a medium ever written. Adare wasan ordinary young Englishman, more interested in hunting, shooting and fishingthan ghosts. It was Adare who saw Home float out of one upper-storey window andin at another. He also saw the materialisation of various spirits—includingSacha and the American actress Ada Mencken—and all the other phenomena that Homehad been producing for the past twenty years. He saw Home stir up the fire untilthe coals were blazing, then pick them up in handfuls and rub his face inthem—neither his face nor his hair was burnt. He also witnessed Home standingagainst a wall, where his height was carefully taken (five feet ten inches),after which Home elongated himself to six foot four.In 1871, Home agreed to be investigated by the young scientist William (laterSir William) Crookes. The anti-spiritualists smiled with satisfaction; they hadno doubt whatever that Crookes would finally demolish the conjuror’s reputation.In the event, Crookes was totally convinced, and published a report to thateffect—to the disgust of his fellow scientists, who decided that he had beenduped. In the controversy that followed, Crookes exploded indignantly: ‘I didn’tsay it was possible—I said it was true.’In the following year, 1872, Home decided it was time to retire. A lawsuit abouthis wife’s estate was decided in his favour, so he was a Russian landowner. Helived on for another fourteen years, to the age of 53, spending his time betweenRussia and the French Riviera. He was wasting away from consumption; but with abeautiful second wife, a comfortable income and hosts of admiring friends, hisfinal years were far from unhappy.The article on Home in Encyclopedia Britannica calls Home an ‘unsolved enigma’.This is true, but not quite in the sense the writer intended. As far as Home wasconcerned, there was no enigma. He had simply inherited unusual psychic powersfrom his mother’s side of the family (and he passed these on to his son Grisha).So the spirits were able to operate through him.As we have seen, this answer failed to satisfy many people who witnessed hisfeats and accepted their genuineness. Lord Lytton thought that Home somehowcaused the phenomena himself. Most modern researchers would probably agree withhim, since most of them are unwilling to accept the spirit hypothesis. Yet onething that becomes very clear to anyone who reads the accounts of Home’sphenomena—as recorded by Lord Adare or Sir William Crookes—is that the spiritsare not only the simplest explanation, but in many cases, the only explanation.A large percentage of the phenomena can only be explained if we assume theexistence of disembodied intelligences. And at this point, it is necessary toacknowledge that, sooner or later, most investigators of the paranormal arefinally driven to the conclusion that spirits almost certainly exist. They dothis with the utmost reluctance. It would be far more convenient, and far morelogically satisfying, if we could explain all the phenomena in terms of theunrecognised powers of the human mind. Total honesty forces the admission thatthis is impossible. And this is nowhere more obvious than in the case of DanielDunglas Home. 1. In Autobiography of a Yogi by Parahansa Yogananda, the author describes how avisiting Yogi had told him that a friend was on his way. When the friendarrived, he told of how the Yogi had approached him in the street, and mentionedthat Parahansa was waiting for him in his room. At the time this happened, theYogi had been with Parahansa. From the point of view of a psychicalinvestigator, the case is dubious because we have only the author’s word for it.1. When I speak of Spiritualism with a capital ‘S’, I refer to the ‘religion’ ofthat name; spiritualism with a small ‘s’ denotes simply the belief in spirits orlife after death.1.

Ibid."},{"pageContent":"5Enter the Ghost DetectivesCASTING AN EYE over the history of spiritualism, it certainly looks as if the‘spirits’ made a tremendous and concerted effort to convince the Victorians oftheir reality. If that is the case, it seems equally clear that they made amiscalculation. The leaders of Victorian public opinion—politicians,intellectuals, churchmen—remained indifferent. And most scientists wereintensely hostile. In the decade after the ‘Hydesville rappings’, they made adetermined attempt to destroy spiritualism by ridicule.They were hardly to blame. If they had behaved in any other way, they would nothave been Victorians. It was their very best qualities—their sense of excitementabout the future, about the tremendous scientific and technical advances, andthe possibilities of humanitarian social reforms—that made them turn their backson the ‘supernatural’. T. H. Huxley expressed this spirit in a burst ofmagnificent exasperation when someone tried to persuade him to attend a seance:‘If anybody could endow me with the faculty of listening to the chatter of oldwomen and curates in the nearest cathedral town, I should decline the privilege,having better things to do.’But when the less waspish investigators could be persuaded to listen to the‘chatter of old women and curates’, they often found it unexpectedlyinteresting. We have already encountered the schoolmaster Alfred Russel Wallace,who was a total sceptic and a disciple of Voltaire; when he went to listen to alecture on mesmerism, he was sufficiently intrigued to try it out on hisstudents. One boy proved to be an unusually good subject; seeming when placed ina trance to ‘tune in’ to Wallace’s mind. Fifteen years later, Wallace becamefamous as the man who had, together with Charles Darwin, discovered evolution bynatural selection—and who, moreover, had allowed Darwin to take priority. In1865, Wallace attended a seance at the house of a sceptical friend, andwitnessed a heavy table moving and vibrating—in broad daylight—while rapsresounded from around the room. That convinced him. A year later, he met anenormous young lady named Agnes Nichols, and watched with incredulity as theelephantine girl floated up into the air. Agnes could also produce‘apports’—objects that fell from the air—and when Wallace asked if the spiritscould produce a sunflower, a six-foot sunflower with a clod of earth round itsroots fell on to the table. Agnes’s spirits never did things by halves; onanother occasion when someone requested flowers, what looked like the wholecontents of a flower shop cascaded from the air. But their most spectacular featoccurred in Highbury on January 3, 1871, when Agnes herself (now married to aman called Guppy) became the ‘apport’. She was seated at the dining-room tabledoing her accounts when she vanished as if the ground had swallowed her. Fourmiles away in Lambs Conduit Street, some ardent spiritualists were seated at atable with their eyes closed, begging the spirits to vouchsafe some smallmanifestation. There was an almighty crash that caused screams, and when someonestruck a match, the mountainous Mrs Guppy was found lying on the table, stillclutching her account book. But again, the spirits had miscalculated. The storyof Mrs Guppy floating four miles certainly caused widespread hilarity, but itdidn’t bring thousands flocking to the Spiritualist churches.Wallace had no doubt that Mrs Guppy could convince the sceptics, so he invitedthree of the most hostile—Professor W. B. Carpenter, Professor John Tyndall andG. H. Lewes, the husband of novelist George Eliot. Carpenter came, sat silentlythrough a cannonade of raps, then went away without comment; he never came back.Neither did Tyndall, whose only comment was ‘Show us something else’. Lewessimply refused to come, as did T. H. Huxley—this was the occasion when Huxleyremarked that he simply could not ‘get up an interest in the subject’.Yet in spite of the refusal of scientists to believe their own eyes and ears,psychic phenomena remained a thorn in the flesh of Victorian intellectuals.After all, it was the business of science to explain mysteries, not ignore them.Some scientists—such as William Crookes, discoverer of the elementthallium—developed a bad conscience about it, and decided to conduct their owninvestigations. When Crookes saw a concertina in a cage playing music of its ownaccord, while Daniel Dunglas Home held it up by one handle, he knew that he wasdealing with unknown forces. His ‘credulity’ caused much head-shaking among hiscolleagues. And later, when he decided that a young lady called FlorenceCook—whose guide, Katie King, materialised and walked round the room—wasgenuine, some of them whispered that Florence had become Crookes’s mistress asthe price of his co-operation.The mathematician Charles Dodgson—who wrote Alice in Wonderland—was another whofelt that the phenomena ought to be explained, not dismissed. He wrote to afriend in 1882:‘That trickery will not do as a complete explanation of all the phenomena . . .I am more than convinced. At the same time, I see no need as yet for believingthat disembodied spirits have anything to do with it . . . All seems to point tothe existence of a natural force, allied to electricity and nerve force by whichbrain can act on brain. I think we are close to the day when this shall beclassified among the known natural forces . . .’That was the ideal aim: to track down this unknown force and stick a label onit. This was the truly Victorian way of banishing this revival of witchcraft.The only problem was that the spirits often converted the sceptics who weretrying to disprove their existence. There was, for example, the embarrassingcase of the American Congressman Robert Dale Owen, son of the great socialreformer Robert Owen. The latter had been a lifelong freethinker—until heencountered the American medium Mrs Hayden. And then, at the age of 83, hedeclared himself a Spiritualist. His son, another freethinker and socialreformer, was furious, and decided that the old man was senile. He was, at thetime, American chargé d’affaires in Naples. In 1856, the Brazilian ambassadorpersuaded him to attend a seance in his apartment, and there Owen saw the tablemoving without human agency. It was, he decided, merely an‘electro-psychological phenomenon’. But he wanted to know how it worked. So hespent the next two years reading books on mesmerism and ‘animal magnetism’, andattending seances. He met Home, who had lost his powers at the time; but thestories of Home’s powers made him feel that he should at least consider thepossibility that spirits were responsible for the phenomena. As a result, hebecame convinced, and wrote a book called Footfalls on the Boundary of AnotherWorld that achieved the same popularity as Mrs Crowe’s Night Side of Nature.Footfalls deserved its popularity; it was an exhaustive, carefully argued book,full of the latest discoveries in modern science, and of some highly convincingcases of clairvoyance, precognitions, poltergeists and ‘phantasms of theliving’. But it is doubtful that it convinced a single scientist.What finally turned the tide in favour of spiritualism was not scientificevidence, but the deep Victorian craving for religious certainty. Nowadays thechief affliction of the intellectuals is angst, a kind of free-floating anxiety.In the Victorian age, it was Doubt with a capital ‘D’. One of the greatVictorian bestsellers was a novel called Robert Ellesmere by Mrs Humphry Ward,about a clergyman who experiences Doubts and feels obliged to resign his living.We find the idea slightly comic—Evelyn Waugh poked fun at it in Decline andFall—but that is because we take doubt for granted. We can scarcely imagine whatit was like to be born into the blissful certainty of a respectable Victorianhousehold—certainty about salvation, about the inspiration of the Bible, aboutthe truth of the Thirty-Nine Articles. Victorian children were brought up tobelieve that Adam was created in precisely 4004 BC, and that any kind of doubton religious matters was as disgraceful as being a drunkard or a prostitute. Sowhen Sir Charles Lyell’s Principles of Geology (1830) argued that the earth wasmillions of years old, Victorians felt as shocked as if an active volcano hadappeared in Trafalgar Square. It was from that point that they began to beundermined by Doubts.One of these unhappy questioners was Professor Henry Sidgwick, of TrinityCollege, Cambridge. Doubt tormented him like a nagging tooth all his life. In1869, at the age of 31, he even felt obliged to resign his fellowship at Trinitybecause he could no longer subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Churchof England. His fellow dons sympathised, and, the moment the religious testswere dropped, reappointed him. He went on to write a celebrated book on ethicsthat ended with the statement that all man’s attempts to find a rational basisfor human behaviour are foredoomed to failure.Sidgwick’s pupils regarded him as a kind of Socrates. There were many brilliantyoung men among them, including Arthur Balfour, a future Prime Minister, EdmundGurney, heir to a Quaker fortune, and Frederick Myers, the son of a clergyman.Myers, another Fellow of Trinity, also felt obliged to resign because of Doubts.One evening in December 1869, Myers paid his old master a visit, and they wentfor a walk under the stars. It was the year in which Sidgwick had resigned hisfellowship, and inevitably, the subject of religion came up. Although neither ofthem could still call themselves Christians, neither of them could accept thatthe universe is a great machine and that human beings have been created by purechance. It was Myers who asked, with a certain desperation, whether, sincephilosophy had failed to solve the riddle of the universe, there might be just achance that the answer lay in the evidence for ghosts and spirits. Neither ofthem felt much optimism, but Sidgwick went on brooding about theidea—particularly when, in the following year, Crookes announced that heintended to investigate Daniel Dunglas Home. The attacks on Crookes outragedtheir sense of fair play, and in 1873 they formed a loose association for theinvestigation of spiritualism and the paranormal. Myers became a schoolinspector, which left him time to attend seances. But at first he found itdiscouraging work; he began to wonder whether there was something about him thatmade the spirits stay away. Then he had an experience that convinced him. Heattended a seance with a medium named Charles Williams—at one of whose seancesMrs Guppy had landed on the table—and a hand materialised in the air. Myers heldit in his own, and felt it grow smaller and smaller until it faded away, leavingnothing behind. That could not be trickery. Myers now began seeking actively formore evidence. Together with Edmund Gurney, Arthur Balfour, Sidgwick and LordRayleigh—the scientist who discovered the element argon—Myers became a dedicated‘psychical researcher’. They were joined by a remarkable clergyman, StaintonMoses, who was also an automatic-writing medium. His obvious genuinenessreinforced Myers’s conviction.A new impetus came from an Irish professor of physics, William Barrett, whotaught at the Royal College of Science in Dublin. Like Alfred Russel Wallace,Barrett had become interested in ‘mesmerism’, and when he was staying with afriend of County Westmeath, he persuaded some of the village children to subjectthemselves to hypnosis. Two proved to be excellent subjects, and with one ofthese Barrett observed what Wallace had experienced with his schoolboy twodecades earlier, ‘community of sensation’. When his friend placed his own handover a lighted lamp, the girl snatched hers away as if afraid of burning. Whenhe tasted sugar, she smiled; when he tasted salt, she frowned. She also provedto be able to read Barrett’s mind. The sceptical Professor Carpenter hadexplained such phenomena by saying that people under hypnosis become abnormallysensitive, so they can recognise almost undetectable sounds or smells. But thatwould not explain how this girl could hold against her head a book containing aplaying card, and describe the card exactly,Barrett wrote a paper about the case, and sent it to the British Association inLondon. It would probably have been ignored, but it happened that Wallace waschairman of the committee that decided which papers to publish. He threw hisweight behind Barrett, and although the committee eventually overruled him,Wallace made sure that Myers saw the paper.By this time, Barrett had found another case that excited him—the family of aclergyman called Creery, who lived at Buxton, in Derbyshire. Creery’s daughterswere unusually good at playing a favourite party trick called the ‘willinggame’, in which a person went out of the room while the others decided what heought to do; when he came back, everyone had to try to ‘will’ him to do it. InBarrett’s presence, Creery’s four daughters demonstrated the ‘willing game’again and again, with hardly a single failure.Barrett met Myers and his fellow ‘psychical investigators’ in London, andsuggested that they ought to form a society for investigating these mysteries.Myers and Gurney were dubious; they felt they were already doing their best. ButBarrett’s enthusiasm prevailed, and the result was the formation of the Societyfor Psychical Research (SPR), which met for the first time in February 1882. Itsoriginal members were the ‘Cambridge group’—Myers, Gurney, Sidgwick (and hiswife Eleanor), Balfour, Barrett, Rayleigh and Wallace. Soon they were joined bydistinguished Victorians such as Tennyson, Gladstone, J. J. Thomson (discovererof the electron), Mark Twain, William James, Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson),John Ruskin, Sir Oliver Lodge, and the painters Frederick Leighton and G. F.Watts.The Society had no objection whatever to sceptics, for its aim was to bring themethods of science to bear on the ‘psychic world’, and try to prove or disproveit once and for all. One result was that Myers and Gurney accepted with pleasurethe services of a sceptical post-office employee named Frank Podmore, whoseoriginal faith in spiritualism had been badly shaken in 1876 by the trial andsubsequent flight of a ‘slate-writing’ medium named Henry Slade. (Theanti-spiritualist Sir Ray Lankester had managed to grab the slate before the‘spirits’ had had a chance to get to work, and found a message already on it. Inspite of strong evidence in his favour, Slade was found guilty on the curiousgrounds that writing by spirits was a violation of the laws of nature, so he hadto be a fraud.) The three-way collaboration produced the classic Phantasms ofthe Living (1886) which took four years to compile. The Society also produced avast Census of Hallucinations, which showed that one person in every ten hadexperienced some kind of hallucination.Now, at last, it should have been possible for the ‘spirits’ to win over thegreat majority of the British public. We have seen that mediums like Home, MrsHayden and Mrs Guppy had no problem convincing scientists once they were given afair chance. In fact, the Society did some very impressive work, establishingthe reality of apparitions, telepathy, clairvoyance and out-of-the-bodyexperiences beyond all reasonable doubt. This early work culminated in Myers’smasterpiece, Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death.But, astonishingly, all this did little or nothing to influence public opinion.The vast audience that had bought The Night Side of Nature and Footfalls on theBoundary of Another World could not be bothered to read huge works full ofsigned statements and detailed examinations of the evidence. And sceptics suchas T. H. Huxley and Sir Ray Lankester felt there would be no point in readingthem anyway, since anyone who could believe in such nonsense must be a gullibleidiot.Regrettably, there was another factor that prevented the public taking the SPRseriously. In its first two decades, a whole series of ‘exposures’ provided thesceptics with all the ammunition they could wish for; the result was that, byabout 1902, the Society had become a kind of joke, rather like the Flat EarthSociety.One of the most damaging of the ‘exposures’ had taken place in 1880, two yearsbefore the Society was formed. The medium Florence Cook, with whom WilliamCrookes had worked, was caught cheating by Sir George Sitwell—father of Edith,Osbert and Sacheverell. Florence was a ‘materialisation medium’. She sat in acabinet with drawn curtains in a dimly lighted room, and after a few minutes, afigure in white would emerge from the cabinet and talk to people in theaudience. The ‘spirit’ called herself Marie, and claimed that she ‘materialised’herself with substances taken from the medium’s body. As she passed by Sitwell’schair, he grabbed her and held her tight until someone produced a light. Then itwas found that ‘Marie’ was Florence Cook in her corset and petticoat; Florence’sother clothes were found in the cabinet.That looked conclusive, although spiritualists accepted Florence’sexplanation—that she was in a trance at the time and had no knowledge of whathad happened. Sir William Crookes immediately came to her defence. He pointedout that in 1873 a man called Volckman had suddenly grabbed the ‘spirit’ as itwalked around the room—in those days, a woman who called herself Katie King. Oneperson present claimed that ‘Katie’s legs and feet had dissolved away and thatshe had escaped from Volckman’s clutch with an upward movement like a seal’. Theaudience rushed to the cabinet and found Florence still there, dressed in black,her knots and seals intact. No trace of the white gown in which ‘Katie’ had beendressed was found in the cabinet.Crookes also described how he had once been allowed to hold ‘Katie’ in his armsat a seance, and found her to be quite solid, like a normal woman. Naturallysuspicious, he asked her if he could see Florence in her cabinet. ‘Katie’agreed, and Crookes entered the cabinet and found Florence in a trance. As faras Crookes was concerned, that was conclusive. As far as the sceptics wereconcerned, it proved one of two things: either that Florence had anaccomplice—perhaps her sister Katie, also a medium—or that Crookes was a liar.After the Sitwell exposure, an authoress named Florence Marryat sat withFlorence in the cabinet, tied to her with a rope; ‘Marie’ appeared as usual andwalked out amongst the audience. But Florence’s reputation had suffered badly,and she soon went into partial retirement.Crookes was undoubtedly deceived by a personable general’s daughter named RosinaShowers. He had no reason to suspect her, for she refused all payment for herseances, at which a figure dressed in white appeared. Crookes had devised asimple test to prevent Florence Cook from cheating; he had made her dip herhands in a coloured dye before the seance, then examined ‘Katie King”s hands.‘Katie’ passed the test without difficulty. But Rosina’s ‘apparition’ had dyedhands. Crookes allowed himself to overlook this—after all, the ‘spirit’ drew itssubstance from the medium, and might have borrowed the dye too. But Rosina wasunable to keep her secret to herself, and told the American medium Annie Faythat she had cheated. Mrs Fay immediately passed this on to Crookes, whodemanded a private interview with Rosina. She confessed her deception, andpromised never to do it again. Crookes, in turn, promised not to expose her.This promise was to cause him some embarrassment. Rosina’s mother found outabout the secret meeting, and put the worst possible construction on it. Havingpromised Rosina to keep silence, Crookes had to endure stoically while MrsShowers spread scandal among her friends and accused him of being a Casanova whohabitually seduced his mediums. It was already general gossip that he had sleptwith Florence Cook when he was ‘investigating’ her in his own house. Crookesfinally decided that psychical research was more trouble than it was worth, andgave it up.In 1888, there was a double scandal. The four Creery girls, whose ‘will game’had so impressed Barrett—and caused him to found the SPR—were caught cheating.They had been constantly tested ever since Barrett discovered them, and hadbecome thoroughly bored with it all. They admitted that they had devised varioussimple signals to aid their ‘card guessing’ games—an upward glance for hearts,down for diamonds, and so on. They insisted that they had only decided to cheatfairly recently, and Myers and Gurney believed them, having made quite sure thatthe girls could not cheat in their own earlier tests. But no one else believedthem.Then, worst of all, the two Fox girls whose manifestations had launched theSpiritualist movement publicly confessed that they were cheats. By 1888, bothwere in their fifties, both were widows, and both were drinking too much. Peoplewere no longer interested in spirit rappings. Sister Leah, on the other hand,was still doing rather well; she and her sisters were barely on speaking terms.It was Leah, in fact, who had launched the fashion for ‘materialisations’ when,at a seance with Robert Dale Owen in 1860, a veiled white figure had walkedround the room. With a supporter like Owen, she could hardly fail. Her sisters,on the other hand, had been badly treated by life. Kate’s children had beentaken from her by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children as aresult of her drunkenness. Margaretta had managed to smuggle them to England, toa guardian, but had been sorely tempted to commit suicide by jumping overboardon the return journey. Her strongest desire was to get her own back on her eldersister Leah. So when she arrived back in America, she took the opportunity of aninterview with a reporter to declare that all the rappings had been a cheat. OnOctober 21, 1888, she and Kate appeared on a platform at the New York Academy ofMusic, and Margaretta confessed that she had made the raps by means of a doublejoint in her big toe. She went on to demonstrate with a series of muffled raps.They were not in the least like the thunderous knockings that had shaken thebedroom of the Hydesville house, but the audience was willing to be convinced,and Margaretta and Kate were able to share $1,500 between them. The reporterReuben Davenport, who had organised the confession, went on to write a bookcalled The Death Blow to Spiritualism. Much of the $1,500 was spent on alcohol.In due course Margaretta wrote a recantation of the confession, which she handedto a wealthy spiritualist, who allowed her to live in an apartment he owned. Heralcoholism made her an impossible tenant and he had to evict her. She died in1895 and was buried in a pauper’s grave, followed soon afterwards by Kate. Inretrospect, the most significant thing about her confession is that Kate satsilently beside her on stage. She neither confirmed the confession nor offeredto demonstrate how she had been deceiving the public with raps for the pastthirty years. The inference seems to be that she agreed to share the platformfor the sake of the $750, but refused to go further than that.Another embarrassment to organised psychical research was the remarkable Italianmedium Eusapia Palladino. She was an illiterate peasant, of large proportions(like so many mediums), who had been discovered in Naples in 1872, when she was18. She was the most powerful medium since Daniel Dunglas Home. Chairs retreatedor moved towards her when she frowned or beckoned them, and hung suspended inthe air. She herself could float up into the air and lie there as if on a couch.She had been investigated by the criminologist Cesare Lombroso, who had no doubtof her genuineness. But she was a highly unstable character, violent, impulsiveand sly. When coming out of trances she would make openly sexual overtures tomales who attracted her. And, what was worse, she cheated. The absurd thing wasthat her cheating was clumsy, and the least competent researcher had nodifficulty in catching her at it. Eusapia herself claimed that this cheating wasdone by hostile spirits, which may or may not have been true (since she wasoften wide-awake when she did it). Yet her other phenomena were so impressivethat there could be no question of cheating. The French astronomer CamilleFlammarion found a better explanation of her cheating when he observed her overa period. After seances at which obviously genuine phenomena had occurred—suchas musical instruments floating round the room when Eusapia was tied to herchair—he observed that she was violently ill, sometimes for as much as two days,vomiting up any food she tried to take. If genuine phenomena produced thiseffect, it was no wonder she tried to get away with cheating . . . When Eusapiacame to England in 1895, she was tested by the SPR at Cambridge, with theconjuror Maskelyne present. Her English hosts were far less indulgent towardsher outrageous cheating than Lombroso had been, and issued a thoroughlyunfavourable report. This should have convinced sceptics that the Society had nointerest in protecting impostors. It only spread the impression that mostmediums were such frauds that no sane person would waste time on them.In 1888, the Society suffered another serious blow—the death of one of its mostbrilliant investigators, Edmund Gurney. In June, he went off to Brighton on somemysterious errand, and was found dead in his hotel bed the next morning with abottle of chloroform beside him, and a sponge bag over his face. An inquestdecided that he died accidentally when taking chloroform for a toothache, butthere was gossip at the SPR that it was suicide. Gurney had been testing variousBrighton youths for telepathy, and had been impressed. One of his ‘telepaths’had to leave hastily for South Africa as a result of a divorce scandal, andtwenty years later he published a confession, declaring that he had cheatedconsistently. It has been suggested that Gurney found out that he had beenhoaxed for years, and that if he was honest about this, it would do even moredamage to psychical research.1 Whatever the truth, his death was a serious lossto the Society.It was not the first time Gurney had been hoaxed. Just as he was putting thefinishing touches to the second volume of Phantasms of the Living in 1886, hereceived a letter from a Portsmouth naval cadet named Sparks, who described howhe had been hypnotising a fellow cadet named Cleave. One day when Cleavewondered what his girlfriend was doing in Wandsworth, Sparks hypnotised him andsuggested that he should go to see her. When he came out of the trance,according to Sparks, Cleave said that he had gone into the room where the girlwas sitting with her little brother; she had stared at him and looked pale as ifshe was going to faint . . . Two days later, Cleave received a letter from thegirl asking whether anything had happened to him, because she had seen him inthe room.This case was too good to miss, so Gurney went to the trouble of gettingconfirmatory letters from Cleave (who was 18) and from the girlfriend, as wellas from two other cadets who claim to have been present. He printed a fullaccount in Phantasms of the Living. Ten years after his death, Myers and Podmorehad to publish a note in the SPR Proceedings admitting that Cleave had nowconfessed to hoaxing Gurney. It was a lesson in not paying too much attention to‘witnessed’ statements. Yet in another sense, the case vindicated the authors ofPhantasms. The hoaxers had all been teenagers. The majority of people quoted inPhantasms are respectable middle-aged citizens, many of them clergymen, and mostof them can have had no possible motive for hoaxing the SPR.In 1898, Myers himself was involved in a minor scandal that brought discredit onthe SPR. In the late 1880s, Myers had met an attractive girl named AdaGoodrich-Freer, who claimed to come from an upper-class Highland family and tobe clairvoyant. Myers had a keen eye for a pretty girl, and he and the girl weresoon convinced that they were soul mates. There is some evidence that they had alove affair. Myers persuaded her to try crystal-gazing, and he felt the resultswere impressive—she claimed to have located a lost key and a medicalprescription, and obtained from the crystal an address she had accidentallydestroyed. Myers wrote a paper about it which came out in the Society’s journal(he called her simply ‘Miss X’). The Society had no reason for doubting such awell-born and refined young lady—after all, why should she lie? What Myers didnot know what that the upper-class Miss Goodrich-Freer was actually the daughterof an Uppingham vet, and her name was simply Freer. She was 30 when Myers mether, not a teenager, as she claimed. And she was a pathological liar. Hermotivation has never been made clear, but it was probably simply a desire forattention.The Society sent Miss Goodrich-Freer to the Highlands to investigate the wholesubject of second sight; it emerged later that she simply borrowed a manuscriptfrom a folklore-collecting priest and printed his material as her own. Sent toinvestigate a haunting in Surrey, she told the owners of the house that she hadseen nothing, but told the SPR that she had seen a hooded female ghost as shedressed for dinner. That should have made them suspicious, but the attractiveand well-mannered Miss Goodrich-Freer seemed above suspicion.In 1897 she heard rumours that Ballechin House, in Scotland, was haunted, andpersuaded a member of the SPR to rent it for her, for ‘shooting and fishing’.Once there, she claimed to have witnessed all kinds of unearthlyphenomena—thumps, bangs, ghostly screams, phantom footsteps, and elusivepresences. There was a poltergeist that tore the clothes off the bed, and aghostly nun, who was spotted by Miss Goodrich-Freer in a nearby glen. Oddlyenough, guests who came to stay with Miss Goodrich-Freer never encountered themore terrifying phenomena, but they heard ominous bangs and footsteps. Back inLondon, she proceeded to write her Alleged Haunting of Ballechin House, but wasincensed when one of her guests, a certain J. Callendar Ross, beat her past thepost with an article in The Times entitled ‘On the Trail of a Ghost’; its tonewas sceptical, not to say satirical. A furious correspondence ensued in thecolumns of The Times, in the course of which it became clear that MissGoodrich-Freer and the SPR had rented the house under false pretences. Its ownerwas naturally displeased at the damage to his rental prospects from all thissensational publicity. Myers, who had been a visitor to Ballechin House,naturally felt obliged to support Miss Goodrich-Freer. But when the wife of theowner denounced the SPR in The Times, he hastened to declare that he had longago decided against publishing his own observations. Another guest who had beenat Ballechin with him immediately contradicted him, saying that Myers haddefinitely expressed his intention of writing about the haunting. MissGoodrich-Freer herself was enraged by what she felt to be Myers’s unchivalrousdesertion. And Mr Callendar Ross expressed the general feeling when he referredto ‘the suspicion and disgust that close contact with the SPR tends to excite’.When Miss Goodrich-Freer published her book on Ballechin, there was still morebad feeling.The scandal may well have brought on the illness that was to kill Myers in 1901.Miss Goodrich-Freer herself experienced a sudden coldness on the part of otherSPR members, and, in his review of her book on Ballechin, Frank Podmore camevery close to calling her a liar. There is evidence1 that she was caughtcheating at a table-rapping seance in 1901, and decided to leave England forJerusalem, where she married a man who was sixteen years her junior—convincinghim that she was two years younger than he was . . . She died in 1931 at the ageof 74 but continued to lie to the end—her death certificate gives her age as 56.These preposterous scandals—mediums in their underwear and ghosts withdouble-jointed big toes—had the unfortunate effect of suggesting that the SPRwas a collection of bumbling crackpots. In fact, looking back after more than acentury, we can see that its achievement during those first two decades wasmonumentally impressive. It had set out to answer the question: Can theparanormal be taken seriously, or is it a collection of old wives’ tales anddelusions? What undoubtedly surprised those pioneers was the sheer mass ofevidence for the paranormal. It must have seemed incredible that one person inten had experienced a hallucination, and that so many people had seenapparitions of dying relatives or had out-of-the-body experiences. Newspaperscandals about fake mediums may have impressed the public, but what impressedthe SPR was that so many mediums were obviously genuine, and that so muchevidence for life after death stood up to the strictest examination. WhenCallendar Ross spoke about the ‘suspicion and disgust’ excited by the SPR, hewas expressing the feeling of most healthy-minded people towards a ‘morbid’subject like psychical research. But morbid or not, it refused to go away. Andthe Society made it harder to ignore by accumulating a positive mountain ofevidence. Phantasms of the Living may be one of the most boring books everwritten, but its 2,000 pages of cases finally batter the mind into therecognition that this is something that has to be faced.Since we have devoted so much space to scandals and exposures, it is only fairto look more closely at a cross-section of the kind of evidence that finallyconvinced those pioneers that they were dealing with reality.On October 21, 1893, Prince Victor Duleep Singh, a son of a maharajah, went tobed in a Berlin hotel, where he was staying together with Lord Carnarvon. Beforeswitching off the light, he looked across the room at a framed picture that hungon the opposite wall. To his surprise, he saw the face of his father, looking athim with an intent expression. Thinking that the picture might resemble hisfather, he got out of bed to see; in fact, it showed a girl holding a rose andleaning on a balcony. Prince Victor described the experience to Lord Carnarvonthe next morning. Later the same day, he received a telegram announcing that hisfather had died of a stroke the previous day. The prince had seen his father’sface at the time when the maharajah was lying unconscious after the stroke, afew hours before he died.On the night of October 16, 1902, the wife of a railway guard woke up about 3a.m. for a drink of water. She was alone in bed, because her husband was onnight duty, and the room was dimly lighted by a gas mantle. As she looked intothe water, she saw a clear image of goods wagons smashing into one another, andobserved which of them was most damaged. She was worried about her husband, incase he had had an accident. At nine the next morning he returned home, and shetold him what she had seen. He told her that there had been an accident on theline that night, and it had happened just as she had seen.The odd point about this case is that her husband had passed the scene of theaccident twice: once at the time his wife had seen her ‘vision’ in the glass ofwater, and again four hours later, when his train was on its way back. But whenhe passed it for the first time, it was dark and he could not see what washappening. At 7 a.m. it was light, and he had then been able to see the sceneclearly—as his wife had seen it in the water. Of course, her husband may haveseen far more subconsciously than he was aware of seeing. But if this wastelepathy, then he had managed to convey to his wife far more than he was awareof seeing.The next case is perhaps one of the most famous ever recorded by the SPR. OnJuly 9, 1904, the novelist Rider Haggard suffered such a bad nightmare that hiswife shook him awake. In his dream, he had seen his daughter’s black retrieverdog, Bob, lying on its side among the undergrowth beside some water. Its headwas at an unnatural angle, and it seemed to be trying to tell him that it wasdying.The next morning at breakfast Haggard told his daughter Angela about his dream.She was quite unworried because she had seen Bob the previous evening and he wassafe and well. It was only later in the day that they learned that Bob wasmissing. Four days later, the dog’s body was found floating in the nearby river.It had been struck by a train on the night Haggard had dreamed about it. He wasable to work out the precise time the accident had taken place—a few hoursbefore he had awakened from his nightmare.On March 19, 1917, Mrs Dorothy Spearman was in her room in a hotel in Calcutta,feeding her baby son. Her little daughter was also in the room. She felt therewas someone behind her, and looked round to see her half-brother, EldredBowyer-Bower, standing there; he was an officer in the Royal Flying Corps. Helooked perfectly normal, and Mrs Spearman assumed he had been posted to Indiaand come to see her. She told him that she would put the baby down, and thenthey could have a long talk. But when she had finished tucking in the baby, herhalf-brother had vanished. Her daughter did not appear to have seen anyone. Shelearned later that her half-brother had been shot down over the German lines atabout the time she had seen him.On December 7, 1918, Lieutenant J. J. Larkin, an RAF officer, was writingletters in the billet when he heard someone walking up the passage outside. Thenthe door opened, and his friend Lieutenant David McConnel shouted ‘Hello boy!’Larkin turned and saw McConnel standing there, holding the doorknob in his hand.He said: ‘Hello, back already?’ and McConnel replied ‘Yes, had a good trip’. Hehad been ferrying a plane to a nearby aerodrome. Then McConnel closed the doorwith a bang and clattered off.When Larkin learned several hours later that McConnel had crashed thatafternoon, he assumed that it must have been after he had seen him. In fact,McConnel had been killed at roughly the same time that Larkin saw him at thedoor.The next case has also become famous, and is regarded as one of the strongestpieces of evidence for survival after death. In June 1925, James Chaffin ofDavie County, North Carolina, dreamed that his father stood by his bedside,wearing an old black overcoat, and told him: ‘You will find the will in myovercoat pocket.’ The father, James L. Chaffin, had died four years earlier,leaving his farm to his third son Marshall, and nothing to his wife or otherthree sons. The will had not been contested, since there seemed no reason to doso.The next morning, James Chaffin hurried to his mother and asked about hisfather’s old black overcoat; she told him it had been given to his brother John.He found the coat at John’s house and examined it carefully. Sewn into thelining of the inside pocket—which his father had indicated in the dream—he founda roll of paper stating: ‘Read the 27th chapter of Genesis in my daddy’s oldBible.’Taking a neighbour as witness, James Chaffin went back to his mother’s house,and unearthed the old Bible. In the 27th chapter of Genesis there was anotherwill—made later than the one that left everything to Marshall—dividing theproperty between the wife and four sons. The first reaction of Marshall Chaffinwas to contest the will, assuming it to be a forgery. But once he examined it,he had to admit that it was obviously genuine. Ten witnesses testified that itwas in old Chaffin’s handwriting. So the property was divided according to thewishes of the second will.Like Marshall Chaffin, the reader’s first reaction is to suspect skulduggery.But the Canadian member of the SPR who heard of the case hired a lawyer toinvestigate it, and the genuineness of the will was established beyond alldoubt. The significance of the twenty-seventh chapter of Genesis is that itcontains the story of how Jacob deceived his blind father Isaac into grantinghim the inheritance of his brother Esau. This thought had apparently come to oldChaffin not long before his death, and he made the new will. But instead ofhaving it properly witnessed, he inserted it in the Bible, no doubt expecting itto be found after his death—together with its implied criticism of his sonMarshall. Unfortunately, the Bible was decrepit, and it may have been that theChaffin family was simply not religiously inclined; so after four years, itseems the old farmer had to draw attention to his change of heart . . .Mrs Crowe’s Night Side of Nature has a whole chapter devoted to similar cases,in which important messages are delivered by dreams or apparitions. She tells,for example, of a butcher who dreamed that he was going to be attacked andmurdered on his way to market by two men dressed in blue. He decided to go tomarket with a neighbour, and, when he came to the place where the attack hadtaken place in his dream, saw the two men in blue waiting there . . . But allshe tells us by way of detail is that the butcher’s name was Bone and that helived in Holytown. This can hardly be regarded as ‘confirmatory detail’. Therecords of the SPR contain many equally melodramatic cases. But they took thetrouble to get signed statements from all concerned, and the result is far moreconvincing. In a typical case of 1869, a couple, identified as ‘Mr and Mrs P’,were lying in bed in a dimly lighted room when ‘Mrs P’ saw a man dressed as anaval officer standing at the foot of the bed. Her husband was dozing, and shetouched his shoulder and said: ‘Willie, who is this?’ Her husband roaredindignantly: ‘What on earth are you doing here, sir?’ The naval officer saidreproachfully: ‘Willie!’, and as ‘Mr P’ leapt out of bed, walked across theroom, and disappeared into the wall. ‘Mrs P’ said he looked like a solid humanbeing, and that as he passed a lamp on his way across the room, he threw ashadow.Realising that they had seen a ‘ghost’, ‘Mrs P’ began to wonder if it forebodedsome disaster to her brother, who was in the navy. When she mentioned this toher husband, he said: ‘No, it was my father.’ ‘P”s father had been dead for someyears.After this visitation, ‘Mr P’ became seriously ill for several weeks. When herecovered, he told his wife that he had been in financial trouble for some time,and before seeing the apparition, he had decided to take the advice of a certainindividual which, he now realised, would have ruined him and probably landed himin jail. He was convinced that the ‘ghost’ had come to warn him not to do it.Intrinsically, this case is no more convincing that that of Mr Bone of Holytown.But the SPR obtained signed depositions from ‘Mr and Mrs P’, and from twofriends to whom ‘Mrs P’ had told the story immediately after it had happened. Itis still possible to dismiss it as a dream or a ‘collective hallucination’, orsimply as a downright lie. But the signed statements make this seem at leastunlikely.An interesting point about the experience is ‘Mrs P”s comment that the figurelooked quite solid and normal—most ‘ghosts’ do—and that it cast a shadow. Thisobviously suggests that it was made of some kind of solid substance, like the‘materialisations’ that appeared in the seance room.A ‘warning’ of a different kind seems to have been involved in a case that cameto be known as the ‘red scratch’ case. It involved a commercial traveller(identified as ‘FG’) who was in his hotel room in St Joseph, Missouri, in 1876,when he became aware of someone sitting at the table. It was his sister Annie,who had died of cholera nine years earlier. She looked exactly as she had whenalive, except that she had a bright red scratch on her right cheek. As ‘FG’sprang to his feet, his sister vanished.He was so shaken that he took a train straight back to his parents’ home in StLouis. When he told them about the scratch, his mother fainted. When sherecovered, she told them that she had accidentally made the scratch on the faceof the corpse. She had covered it up with powder, and never mentioned it toanyone.A few weeks later, the mother died, ‘happy in the belief that she would rejoinher favourite daughter’. Her son obviously took the view that the purpose of theapparition was to prepare her mother for her own death. This is another themethat runs fairly constantly through reports of apparitions and ‘death-bedvisions’ collected by the SPR. Sir William Barrett was later to devote a book tothem, and its opening case is typical of the kind of thoroughness the SPRbrought to its investigations.Barrett’s wife was an obstetric surgeon in the Maternity Hospital at Clapton inNorth London. A woman she calls Mrs B was in labour and suffering from heartfailure. As Lady Barrett was holding her hands, she said: ‘It’s getting dark.’Her mother and husband were sent for. Then ‘Mrs B’ looked at another part of theroom and said: ‘Oh, lovely.’ ‘What is lovely?’ ‘Lovely brightness—wonderfulthings.’ Then she exclaimed: ‘Why, it’s father!’ Her baby was brought in for herto see, and she asked: ‘Do you think I ought to stay for the baby’s sake?’ Shelooked towards her ‘father’, and said: ‘I can’t stay.’ When her husband hadarrived, she looked across the room and said: ‘Why, there’s Vida!’ Vida was heryounger sister, who had died two weeks earlier. But her death had been kept from‘Mrs B’, so as not to upset her. She died soon after. Lady Barrett, the matronand the husband and the mother all vouched that she seemed to remain consciousof the dead relatives up to the time of her death. With his usual thoroughness,Barrett obtained a letter verifying all this from the mother. It is the first ofa number of cases cited by Barrett in which people on the point of death have‘seen’ relatives whom they did not know to be dead. Barrett points out thatthere is no known case of a dying person ‘seeing’ someone who is still alive.Sir Oliver Lodge, who was twice president of the SPR, was himself to supply oneof the most convincing cases of ‘communication with the dead’; it is recorded inhis book Raymond.On August 8, 1915, Sir Oliver Lodge received a message from a Boston medium,Leonore Piper, containing an obscure reference to a poem by the Roman poetHorace, about a tree being struck by lightning. Lodge interpreted this as awarning of some disaster. The message purported to come from Frederic Myers, whohad been dead for fourteen years. A week later, Lodge heard that his youngestson Raymond had been killed in the Ypres campaign.After this, a number of mediums relayed messages that purported to come fromRaymond, but Lodge remained unconvinced— most of them were of the ‘Having alovely time’ variety. But in the following month, Lodge’s wife was taken by afriend to a seance with a remarkable medium, Mrs Osborne Leonard. Neither themedium nor Lady Lodge knew one another by sight, and they were not introduced.Nevertheless, Mrs Leonard announced that she had a message from ‘Raymond’, whostated that he had met many of his father’s friends since death; asked to nameone of them, Raymond replied ‘Myers’.Another ‘message’ from Raymond was relayed to Lady Lodge via a male mediumcalled Vout Peters; in it, ‘Raymond’ spoke about a photograph showing himself ina group of people, and referring to a walking-stick. The Lodges knew nothingabout such a photograph. Two months later, the mother of one of Raymond’s fellowofficers wrote to say that she had a group photograph including Raymond, andoffering to send a copy. Before this arrived, Lodge himself visited Mrs Leonard,and when her ‘control’ ‘Feda’ announced Raymond’s presence, he took theopportunity to ask about the photograph. Raymond explained that it had beentaken outdoors, and mentioned that someone had wanted to lean on him. When thephotograph arrived a few days later, it showed a group of officers outside abillet. Raymond, sitting in the front row, has a cane resting on his leg, andthe officer sitting behind him is using Raymond’s shoulder as an arm rest.Lodge’s book gives many more examples of evidence of Raymond’s ‘survival’; but,as he points out, this one is particularly convincing because it involves twomediums, both of whom spoke of the photograph before Lodge knew of itsexistence—thus ruling out any possibility of telepathy.To conclude this chapter, here is a final example of a type of phenomenon sobeloved of Mrs Crowe and other early writers on the ‘supernatural’: thefull-scale haunting.In February 1932, the grandchildren of a chimney-sweep named Samuel Bull refusedto go to sleep, insisting that there was someone outside the door of thecottage. (They were sleeping in a downstairs room, recovering from influenza.)Their mother, Mary Edwards, looked outside the door, but there was no one there.Soon afterwards, she and the children saw the figure of Samuel Bull—who had beendead since the previous June—walk across the room, up the stairs, and throughthe door of the room in which he had died. (This was closed). They all screamed.This was the first of many appearances of the dead man at his cottage in OxfordStreet, Ramsbury, Wiltshire. The ‘ghost’ was apparently aware of the presence ofhis family, for he twice placed his hand on the brow of his invalid wife Jane,and once spoke her name. Samuel Bull—who had died of cancer—looked quite solid,and could be seen so clearly that the children noticed the whiteness of hisknuckles, which seemed to be protruding through the skin. They also noticed thatthe expression on his face was sad. After the first appearance, the family nolonger felt alarmed—the children seemed ‘awed’ rather than frightened. Theyassumed that the ghost was looking sad because of the miserable conditions theywere living in—the cottage was damp and some rooms were unfit for habitation. Onthe last two occasions on which he appeared, Samuel Bull no longer looked sad,and Mrs Edwards assumed that this was because the family was to be re-housed ina council-house.The family was already on the move when the two investigators from the SPRarrived, but the local vicar had already interviewed the family and recordedtheir accounts of what took place. The investigators were understandably upsetthat they had not been told about the case earlier, but their conversations withwitnesses, and the evidence of the vicar, left them in no doubt that thehaunting was genuine.This rag-bag of assorted visions and apparitions underlines the enormous varietyof cases investigated by the SPR in the first century of its existence. None ofthem are, in themselves, more impressive than cases cited by Jung-Stilling orCatherine Crowe or Robert Dale Owen. But they are more convincing because honestinvestigators have obviously done their best to confirm that they are genuine.And anyone who is willing to spend a few hours browsing through volumes of theProceedings of the SPR (or its American counterpart) is bound to end with afeeling that further scepticism is a waste of time. Even if half the casesproved to be fraudulent or misreported, the other half would still beoverwhelming by reason of sheer volume. It is easy to understand the irritationof Professor James Hyslop when he wrote in Life After Death:‘I regard the existence of discarnate spirits as scientifically proved and I nolonger refer to the sceptic as having any right to speak on the subject. Any manwho does not accept the existence of discarnate spirits and the proof of it iseither ignorant or a moral coward. I give him short shrift, and do not proposeto argue with him on the supposition that he knows nothing about the subject.’Where sceptics are concerned, he certainly has a point. Sir John Bland Sutton, awell-known surgeon, remarked: ‘Death is the end of all. My experience is thatall of those who have studied the subject scientifically and deeply have come tothe same conclusion.’ Such a statement simply lacks the ring of truth. Therehave been many basically sceptical investigators—Hyslop himself was notoriously‘tough-minded’, and much disliked by fellow members of the SPR because he seemedan incorrigible ‘doubting Thomas’—but in every single case where a sceptic haspersisted in studying the facts, he has ended up more-or-less convinced of thereality of life after death. I say ‘more or less’ because a few investigators,such as Dr Gardner Murphy and Mrs Louisa Rhine, feel that most of the ‘facts’can also be explained by what might be called ‘super ESP’—mind-readingclairvoyance, and so on. Hyslop himself finally abandoned the ‘super ESP’hypothesis through an experience that has become known as the ‘red pyjamascase’, He received a communication from a medium in Ireland to the effect that a‘spirit’ calling itself William James had asked him to pass on a message askinghim if he remembered some red pyjamas. Now William James, who had died in 1910,had agreed with Hyslop that whichever of them died first should try tocommunicate with the other. But the message about red pyjamas meant nothing toHyslop. Then suddenly he remembered. When he and James were young men, they wentto Paris together, and discovered that their luggage had not yet arrived. Hyslopwent out to buy some pyjamas, but could only find a bright red pair. For daysJames teased Hyslop about his poor taste in pyjamas. But Hyslop had longforgotten the incident. As far as he could see, there was no way of explainingthe red pyjamas message except on the hypothesis that it was really WilliamJames who had passed it on.Twenty-six years after Hyslop’s death, he was quoted by the psychologist CarlJung in a letter. Jung was discussing the question of the identity of ‘spirits’who communicate through mediums:‘I once discussed the proof of identity for a long time with a friend of WilliamJames, Professor Hyslop, in New York. He admitted that, all things considered,all these metapsychic phenomena could be explained better by the hypothesis ofspirits than by the qualities and peculiarities of the unconscious. And here, onthe basis of my own experience, I am bound to concede he is right. In eachindividual case I must of necessity be sceptical, but in the long run I have toadmit that the spirit hypothesis yields better results in practice than anyother.’1Yet it is significant that Jung never made this admission in any of hispublished work, where he continued to insist that the facts about the paranormalcould be explained in terms of the powers of the unconscious mind.1As far as the present investigation is concerned, we shall proceed on Jung’sassumption that the ‘spirit hypothesis’ fits the facts better than any other.The question of whether it is ultimately true must, for the time being, be leftopen. 1.

He was told that the racket wasbeing made by a vagrant named William Drury, who had been in town for a fewdays. Drury had been trying to persuade the local constables to give him publicassistance, on the strength of a ‘pass’ signed by two eminent magistrates. Theconstable suspected that the pass was forged.Mompesson ordered the drummer to be brought before him, and examined his papers;just as the bailiff had suspected, they were forged. Mompesson seems to havebeen an officious sort of man who enjoyed exercising his authority; he orderedthe drummer—a middle-aged man—to be held until the next sitting of the localBench, and meanwhile confiscated his drum. The man seems to have tried hard topersuade Mompesson to return the drum, but without success. As soon asMompesson’s back was turned, the constable seems to have allowed Drury toescape. But the drum stayed behind.A few weeks later, the bailiff of Ludgershall sent the drum to Mompesson’s housein Tedworth. Mompesson was just on his way to London. When he came back he foundthe house in uproar. For three nights, there had been violent knockings and rapsall over the house—both inside and out. That night, when the banging started,Mompesson leapt out of bed with a pistol and rushed to the room from which thesound was coming. It moved to another room. He tried to locate it, but it nowseemed to be coming from outside. When he got back into bed, he was able todistinguish drumbeats among the rapping noises.For the next two months, it was impossible to get to sleep until the middle ofthe night; the racket went on for at least two hours every night. It stoppedbriefly when Mrs Mompesson was in labour, and was silent for three weeks—anindication that the spirit was mischievous rather than malicious. Then thedisturbances started up again, this time centring around Mompesson’s children.The drumbeats would sound from around their beds, and the beds were often liftedup into the air. When the children were moved up into a loft, the drummerfollowed them. The servants even began to get used to it; one manservant saw aboard move, and asked it to hand it to him; the board floated up to his hand,and a joking tug-of-war ensued for twenty minutes or so, until the masterordered them to stop. When the minister came to pray by the children, the spiritshowed its disrespect by being noisier than usual, and leaving behind adisgusting sulphurous smell—presumably to imply it came from Hell. Scratchingnoises sounded like huge rats.Things got worse. During the next two years lights were seen, doors slammed,unseen skirts rustled, and a Bible was burnt. The creature purred like a cat,panted like a dog, and made the coins in a man’s pocket turn black. One day,Mompesson went into the stable and found his horse lying on its back with itshind hoof jammed into its mouth; it had to be pried out with a lever. The‘spirit’ attacked the local blacksmith with a pair of pincers, snatched a swordfrom a guest, and grabbed a stick from a servant woman who was trying to bar itspath. The Reverend Joseph Glanvil—who wrote about the case—came to investigate,and heard the strange noises from around the childrens’ beds. When he went downto his horse, he found it sweating with terror, and the horse died soonafterwards.The phantom drummer seems to have developed a voice; one morning, there was abright light in the children’s room and a voice kept shouting: ‘A witch, awitch!’—at least a hundred times, according to Glanvil. Mompesson woke up onenight to find himself looking at a vague shape with two great staring eyes,which slowly vanished. It also developed such unpleasant habits as emptyingashes and chamberpots into the childrens’ beds.In 1663, William Drury was arrested at Gloucester for stealing a pig. While hewas in Gloucester jail, a Wiltshire man came to see him, and Drury asked whatwas happening in Wiltshire. When the man said ‘Nothing,’ Drury said: ‘What,haven’t you heard about the drumming in the house at Tedworth?’ The man admittedthat he had, whereupon Drury declared: ‘I have plagued him, and he shall neverbe quiet until he has made me satisfaction for taking away my drum.’ This,according to Glanvil, led to his being tried for a witch at Salisbury andsentenced to transportation. As soon as Drury was out of the country, peacedescended on the Mompesson household. But the drummer somehow managed to escapeand return to England—whereupon the disturbances began all over again. MrMompesson seems to have asked it—by means of raps—whether Drury was responsible,and it replied in the affirmative.How the disturbances ended is not clear—presumably they faded away, like mostpoltergeists. Certainly they had ceased by the time Glanvil published hisaccount twenty years later.The ‘ghost’ that caused these disturbances in the Mompesson household belongs tothe class of phenomena known as the ‘poltergeist’. The word is German, and means‘noisy ghost’. It is the commonest type of spirit on record, and unless you arein the middle of an ocean or a desert, there is probably a poltergeist hauntinggoing on within ten miles of the place where you are now reading this book . . .What is a poltergeist? It is a ‘spirit’ that seems to specialise in mischievoustricks, such as making scratching or banging noises, and causing objects to flythrough the air. It would not be quite accurate to say that they ‘throw’ things,for the objects often have a strange habit of changing direction abruptly inmid-air, as if they are being carried rather than thrown. Moreover, theseobjects have been known to go through walls, and to come out on the other side.It is as if the poltergeist can de-materialise things and then materialise themagain—either that, or the world of the poltergeist possesses an extra dimensionto our three normal dimensions of length, breadth and height, so it can somehow‘step over’ obstacles like walls.Glanvil wrote his book on strange occurrences—Saducismus Triumphatus—just beforethe dawning of the 18th century, the age of reason. Even in the 1660s, themagistrate Mompesson was widely suspected of somehow fabricating the story ofthe phantom drummer, and ‘he suffered by it in his name, in his estate, in allhis affairs . . .’ A quarter of a century after its publication, Glanvil’s bookwas regarded as an absurd relic of an age of credulity. The main reason was thatthe civilised world was finally—after four centuries—shaking off the belief inwitchcraft. In England, there had been no mass trials of witches since the deathof Matthew Hopkins, the ‘witchfinder general’, in 1646; in America, the witchhysteria came to an end after the Salem trials in 1692. The age of science haddawned; there was no room for books like Saducismus Triumphatus in the age ofNewton and Leibniz.One of the most remarkable cases of the early 18th century was investigated bythe eminent scientist Joseph Priestley who, predictably, decided that thephenomena were caused by a hoaxer. It began at the rectory of Epworth, inLincolnshire, inhabited by the family of the Reverend Samuel Wesley, grandfatherof the founder of Methodism. On December 1, 1716, the Wesleys’ maidservant wasin the dining-room when she heard appalling groans, like someone dying. Thefamily made a joke of it. But a few nights later, they were awakened by loudknocking sounds, which usually seemed to come from the garret or nursery. Theonly person who failed to hear them was the Reverend Wesley himself, and thefamily decided not to tell him in case he thought it was an omen of his death.When they finally told him, he refused to believe them; that night, as if toconvince him, there were nine loud knocks by his bedside.From then on, the house was in a constant state of disturbance, with footstepsin empty rooms and up and down the stairs—often more than one set of footstepsat a time—noises like smashing bottles, and a curious sound which was comparedto the ‘winding up of a jack’ or someone planing wood. When Mrs Wesley heardknocking noises from the nursery, she tried repeating them, and the poltergeistthen made the same knocks resound from the floorboards under her feet. When shelooked under the bed, an animal like a badger ran out. A manservant who saw theanimal sitting by the dining-room fire said it looked like a white rabbit.The family were at first afraid that it portended someone’s death, either thatof the Reverend Samuel Wesley or of his elder son (of the same name). Whennothing of the sort occurred, they decided that they were dealing withwitchcraft—against which the Reverend Samuel had preached. Yet they also noticedthat the disturbances seemed connected with the 19-year-old Hetty Wesley: sheoften trembled in her sleep before the sounds began.After two months, the poltergeist went away, although it is said to have madeoccasional brief reappearances in later years. The family came to refer to it as‘Old Jeffrey’. And Mrs Wesley remained convinced that Old Jeffrey was the spiritof her brother, who worked for the East India Company, and who vanished withouta trace. She could well have been right. In some respects, the poltergeistbehaved like a ghost. Its activities always seemed to begin at a quarter to tenevery night (few poltergeists keep to an exact timetable)—and the very firstsounds heard were groans and heavy breathing, not the usual raps. Poltergeistdisturbances usually—almost invariably—occur in a certain sequence. The earlieststage is usually some kind of scratching noise like rats; then raps and bangs,then flying stones or other small objects, then larger objects, then other formsof physical mischief—moving furniture, blankets pulled off beds. If voicesoccur, they usually occur after this stage—as we shall see in the case of theBell Witch. It is almost unknown for phenomena to occur in a different order. Soin that respect, the Wesley case is unusual, starting with what is usually oneof the later developments. The chief objection to Mrs Wesley’s theory is that ifthe spirit of her dead brother was behind the disturbances, then why did he nottry to communicate—for example, when the Reverend Samuel tried to get him toanswer questions by means of raps?One of the more obvious features of the Epworth case is that there were none ofthe usual physical phenomena—falling stones, dancing furniture. The explanation,presumably, is that there was not enough energy available for the poltergeist todo anything more spectacular than make noises. This is also true of the mostnotorious poltergeist of the 18th century, the ‘Cock Lane ghost’. This beganwith knocking noises in the house of Richard Parsons, clerk of St Sepulchre’schurch in Smithfield, London, in November 1759. One night, a woman named FannyLynes, who was lodging in the house, asked 10-year-old Elizabeth Parsons, theeldest daughter, to sleep with her while her common-law husband was away onbusiness. All went well for a few nights; then the two were kept awake one nightby scratching and rapping noises from behind the wainscot. When they toldRichard Parsons about it, he said it was probably the cobbler next door.Soon afterwards, Fanny became ill with smallpox; she was six months pregnant,and her ‘husband’ was understandably anxious. He and Fanny were unmarried onlybecause she was his deceased wife’s sister. William Kent had married ElizabethLynes two years earlier, but she had died in childbirth; now it looked rather asif the story was repeating itself. He moved Fanny into a house nearby, where, onFebruary 2, 1760, she died of smallpox.Meanwhile, the rappings in Richard Parsons’ house were continuing; Parsonsactually called in a carpenter to take down the wainscotting, but nothing wasfound. Meanwhile, the knockings got louder, and the story of the ‘haunted house’spread throughout the neighbourhood. They seemed to be associated withElizabeth; they came from behind her bed, and when they were about to begin, shewould begin to tremble and shiver—like Hetty Wesley in the Epworth case. Laterthat year, Elizabeth began to suffer from convulsions.Like so many victims of poltergeist phenomena, Richard Parsons decided to callin a friend, the Reverend John Moore, assistant preacher at St Sepulchre’s. Andthe Reverend Moore proceeded to communicate with the ‘spirit’, asking it toanswer his questions in the usual manner—one rap for yes, two for no. (Theyadded a scratching noise to indicate it was displeased.)By this means the spirit told its upsetting story. It was, it declared, theghost of Fanny Lynes, returned from the dead to denounce her late ‘husband’,William Kent, for killing her by poison. He had, it seemed, administered redarsenic in her ‘purl’, a mixture of herbs and beer.Richard Parsons was not entirely displeased to hear this story, for he wasnursing a grudge against his late tenant. William Kent was a fairly rich man,having been a successful innkeeper in Norfolk, and he had lent Parsons £20, onthe understanding that Parsons should repay it at a pound a month. Parsons, whoseems to have been a drunkard, had failed to repay anything, possibly because hehad discovered that Kent and Fanny were not married, and hoped to blackmail Kentinto forgetting the loan. Kent had put the matter into the hands of hisattorney.If Parsons had been less anxious to believe the worst of his ex-tenant, he mighthave suspected the ghost of untruthfulness. To begin with, the knocking hadbegun while Fanny Lynes was still alive. And a publican named Franzen swore thathe had seen a spirit in white one evening in December 1759, when Fanny had justmoved from the Cock Lane house. Parsons apparently found it easier to believethat the earlier knockings had been caused by Kent’s first wife Elizabeth—whowas presumably also trying to denounce him for murder.Throughout 1761, the house in Cock Lane acquired an increasing reputation forits ghosts, and the tale about Kent’s supposed murders gained wide currency inthe area. Kent himself heard nothing about it until January 1762, when he saw anitem in the Public Ledger about a man who had brought a young lady from Norfolkand poisoned her in London. A few days later, another item about the Cock Laneghost and its revelations led Kent to go along to see the Reverend John Moore.Moore, a respectable and well-liked man, could only advise Kent to attend aseance in Elizabeth’s bedroom, and see for himself. Kent did this, taking withhim the doctor and apothecary who had attended Fanny in her last illness. Thesmall bedroom was crowded, and Elizabeth and her younger sister lay side by sidein the bed. At first the ‘ghost’ declined to manifest itself; but when the roomhad been emptied, Moore succeeded in persuading it, and they all trooped back.Now Kent listened with something like panic as he heard Moore asking the spiritif it was Kent’s wife—one knock—if it had been murdered by him—one knock—and ifanyone else was concerned in the murder plot—two knocks. Kent shoutedindignantly, ‘Thou art a lying spirit!’Now, suddenly, the ghost was famous all over London, and Cock Lane was crowdedwith carriages. In February, a clergyman named Aldrich persuaded Parsons toallow his daughter to come to his vicarage in Clerkenwell to be tested. Aninvestigating committee, including the famous Dr Johnson, was present.Inevitably, the ghost declined to manifest itself. Nor would the ghost rap onthe coffin of Fanny Lynes in the vault of the church. Dr Johnson concluded itwas a fraud. And this was the opinion of most of London.On the day following this fiasco, Elizabeth was staying at the house of acomb-maker in Cow Lane when the bell of Newgate Prison began to toll—a sign thatsomeone was to be hanged. The comb-maker asked the ghost whether someone wasabout to be hanged and whether it was a man or woman; the ghost answered bothquestions correctly. Later that day, a loose curtain began to spin on itsrod—the only physical manifestation in the case.The following day, as Elizabeth lay asleep, her father heard whispering noises;he carried a candle over to her bed, but she seemed to be asleep. The whisperingcontinued, although the child’s lips were plainly closed. In fact, thepoltergeist seemed to be increasing in strength. Two nights later, the noiseswere so violent that their host asked them to leave. (Presumably she wassleeping away from home to avoid crowds.) Elizabeth and her father moved to thehouse of a Mr Missiter, near Covent Garden, and the manifestations continued,even when a maid lay in bed beside Elizabeth and held her hands and feet.By now, the unfortunate Kent was determined to prove his innocence through thelaw; so the burden of proof now lay on Parsons and his daughter. Elizabeth wastold that unless the ghost made itself heard that night, her father and motherwould be thrown into prison. Naturally, she made sure something happened. Theservants peered through a crack in the door, and saw her take a piece of boardand hide it in the bed. Later, when there were people in the room, the knockingnoises sounded from the bed. In fact, the listeners noticed that the knocks werecoming from the bed and not, as usual, from around the room. The bed wassearched and the board found. And the next day, the newspapers published thestory of the ‘fraud’.On February 25, 1762, there appeared a pamphlet entitled: The Mystery Revealed;Containing a Series of Transactions and Authentic Testimonials respecting thesupposed Cock Lane Ghost, which have been concealed from the Public—the authorwas probably Johnson’s friend Oliver Goldsmith. A satirical play called TheDrummer or the Haunted House was presented at Covent Garden. And William Kentbegan legal proceedings against Richard Parsons. In July 1762, Mr and MrsParsons, and a woman called Mary Frazer—who had often acted as ‘questioner’ tothe ghost—appeared before magistrates in the Guildhall. Parsons was charged withtrying to take away the life of William Kent by charging him with murder. Thejudges remained unconvinced by the evidence of neighbours who had heard rapsresounding from all over the room, and who were certain that Elizabeth could nothave made them. And finally, Parsons was sentenced to two years in prison, andto stand three times in the pillory; his wife was sentenced to one year, andMary Frazer to six months. The Reverend Moore and one of his associates had topay out £588 in damages to Kent. There was universal sympathy for Parsons, andwhen he stood in the pillory, the mob took up a collection for him—an unusualgesture for a period when malefactors were often badly injured in the pillory.(Later in the year a man convicted of sodomy was stoned to death in the samepillory.)For more than two centuries, the Cock Lane ghost became a synonym for animposture. When Andrew Lang wrote about it in 1894, he began his chapter: ‘Ifone phantom is more discredited than another, it is the Cock Lane ghost.’ Yetfor anyone studying the case today, this view seems absurd. Nothing could bemore obvious than that the Cock Lane ghost was a poltergeist like the hundredsof others that have been recorded down the ages. Unfortunately, it is now toolate for us to discover certain essential facts that might help to explain it.For example, what kind of a girl was Elizabeth Parsons? She was rather youngerthan most poltergeist-children, but she may well have been sexually mature forher age. If her father was something of a drunkard and a spendthrift—as therecords indicate—then it seems fairly certain that the Parsons household was nota happy one. The father of Christine Beauchamp—Morton Prince’s famous case ofmultiple personality—was a similar type of person, and his daughter had severepsychological problems as a consequence. We know that Christine Beauchamp becamefixated on her father’s closest friend William Jones, and transferred to him allher adoration. It is conceivable that Elizabeth Parsons felt the same aboutWilliam Kent. In which case, sleeping in his bed while he was away must havearoused morbid emotions—especially if she was aware that Kent and Fanny were‘living in sin’. The convulsions that began a year after the disturbancescertainly suggest she was passing through a period of emotional upheaval. Butsince we know so little about Elizabeth, all these things must remain a matterfor speculation.Only one thing seems fairly certain: that the spirit itself was neither that ofElizabeth Kent nor of Fanny Lynes; it was the usual mischievous poltergeist,bent on creating as much havoc and confusion as possible. It seems to confirmChesterton’s remark that the only definite thing that can be said about suchspirits is that they tell lies.The Epworth poltergeist and the Cock Lane ghost confined themselves to rappings(although the Cock Lane ghost seemed to be attempting more ambitious phenomenatowards the end). A poltergeist that haunted a farm in Stockwell, London, in1772 showed altogether less restraint. It began by throwing rows of plates offthe kitchen shelf and smashing them. When the owner of the house, Mrs Golding,fainted, the doctor bled her; the blood had only just congealed when it leaptout of the basin, and the basin smashed in pieces. When Mrs Golding offered someof the assembled guests a drink of wine or rum, these bottles also shattered.Joints of ham leapt off their hooks on the ceiling and fell to the floor. Theracket was so tremendous that they were afraid the house would fall down, andthe children were sent off to the barn. The maid, Ann Robinson, went with them,and as soon as she was out of the house, the disturbances stopped. The momentshe returned, they started again. The coal scuttle overturned, candlesticks flewthrough the air, a nine-gallon cask of beer was turned upside down, and a bucketof cold water ‘boiled like a pot’—as in the Amherst case of a century later. MrsGolding decided to sack the maid, and the uproar promptly ceased.This case attracted little attention at the time—if Dr Johnson heard of it, heno doubt dismissed it as another fraud. Catherine Crowe unearthed it a centurylater for her book The Night Side of Nature. And in her chapter on thepoltergeist, she makes some sensible and pertinent suggestions. She discussesthe case of a French girl called Angélique Cottin, who was weaving silk gloveson January 15, 1846, when the loom began to jerk violently. The other girls wereterrified, and retreated to the far end of the room; then, one by one, they wentback to examine the loom, which had a heavy oak frame. As soon as Angéliqueapproached, it began to dance again.From this time on, Angélique developed the power of giving people violentelectric shocks—she was, in fact, a ‘human electric eel’. Objects laid on herapron flew off violently, and the power was strong enough to raise a heavy tubwith a man sitting on it. Oddly enough, metals were not affected, indicatingthat this form of ‘electricity’ was not the usual kind. When Angélique wastired, the current would diminish. It also diminished when she was on a carpet,but was most powerful when she was on bare earth—another indication that theforce seems to come from the earth, and is probably connected with the forcethat convulses some dowsers. She had to sleep on a stone covered with a corkmat. The phenomena continued for four months, and were widely studied by men ofscience; then they ceased.Mrs Crowe makes the reasonable suggestion that poltergeist phenomena may beelectrical in nature, and cites a number of other cases, including a Mlle.Emmerich, sister of the professor of theology at Strasbourg, who became a humanelectric battery after receiving a severe fright, the nature of which is notspecified. (We have already noticed that many mediums seem to develop theirpowers after accidents.) The interesting thing about Mlle. Emmerich was that shecould give people shocks even when they were not touching her. She gave herbrother a shock when he was several rooms away; when he rushed to her bedroom,she laughed and said: ‘Ah, you felt it, did you?’Mrs Crowe adds the interesting remark: ‘Many somnambulistic persons [she meanspersons under hypnosis] are capable of giving an electric shock; and I have metwith one person, not somnambulistic, who informs me that he has frequently beenable to do it by an effort of will.’Clearly, if someone was able to produce electric currents at will, he or shemight be in a position to cause poltergeist phenomena—perhaps even at adistance, like Mlle. Emmerich; in that case, we might have some kind ofexplanation for the magical powers of the drummer of Tedworth. But although thetheory is attractive, it could only explain the least spectacular abilities ofthe poltergeist—like causing raps and smashing plates. How, for example, couldit account for the extraordinary case that has become known as the Bell Witch,in which a poltergeist mistreated its victim until he died?This case, as the paranormal investigator Nandor Fodor pointed out, took placeat an interesting time when Americans had ceased to believe in witchcraft, andhad not yet discovered Spiritualism. As a result, there was no properinvestigation. It is fortunate that the records that have survived are sodetailed.In 1817, a farmer named John Bell lived with his family in Robertson County,Tennessee, with his wife Lucy and nine children. One of these, Betsy, was a girlof twelve.At first, the disturbances were so slight that no one paid much attention. Therewere knocking and scraping noises, and sounds like rats gnawing inside thewalls. As usual, nothing could be found to account for these sounds. They seemedto be mostly the kind of noises that might be made by animals, and so did notcause a great deal of excitement. An invisible dog seemed to be clawing at thefloor, an invisible bird flapped against the ceiling, then two chained dogssounded as if they were having a fight. When lamps were lit and people got outof bed to search, the noises stopped—poltergeists seem to have an odd dislike ofbeing observed. Then the entity started pulling the clothes off beds, and makingvarious ‘human’ noises—choking and gulping sounds followed by a gasping noise asif someone was being strangled. Next, stones were thrown and chairs turnedupside down. Slowly, the poltergeist began to get into its stride. The girlBetsy—Elizabeth—seemed to be the focus; things only happened when she wasaround.When the disturbances had been going on for roughly a year, the household was inpermanent chaos. They seldom got a good night’s sleep; the house often shookwith the noises. The thing seemed to be able to be in several places at once—onenight, Richard Williams Bell was awakened by something pulling his hair so hardthat he thought the top of his head would come off; as he yelled with pain,Betsy, on the floor above, also began to scream as something pulled her hair.Like the Fox family thirty years later, the Bells decided to ask the advice ofneighbours. A friend named James Johnson came to the house. When the ‘ghost’made a sound like sucking air in through the teeth, he told it to be quiet, andit obeyed him. But poltergeists dislike being given orders (they seem to reactbest to a friendly approach), and this one redoubled its persecution of Betsy;there would be a sharp slapping noise and her cheek would go red from a blow, orher hair would be grabbed by an invisible hand and pulled. At least, Johnson haddiscovered that the entity understood English; so he advised Bell to invite inmore neighbours. At this stage, he still seems to have entertained the obviouslyabsurd idea that the children might be responsible. They tried sending Elizabethto stay with a neighbour; the disturbances in the Bell household stopped, butElizabeth continued to be persecuted with blows and scratches.Poltergeist phenomena always work their way up from small effects to largerones—from scratches or raps to flying stones and furniture; it never happens theother way around. The ‘Bell Witch’ seemed to take pleasure in developing newways of upsetting everybody. Strange lights flitted about the yard after dark.As the children came home from school, stones and chunks of wood were thrown atthem. These were usually thrown from a particular thicket, and (as usual in suchcases) never hurt anyone; if the children threw them back, they were promptlythrown again. But visitors to the house received stinging slaps—as did thechildren if they tried to resist when the covers were dragged off their beds.The next stage was a whistling sound, which gradually changed to a voice.Poltergeist voices do not sound at all like ordinary human voices; at least, notto begin with. It seems as if the entity is having to master a strange medium,to form sounds into words. (Even the rapping noises are probably ‘manufactured’sounds, not genuine raps made by hard objects.) Most talking ghosts andpoltergeists begin in a guttural voice that sounds as if it is made up fromgrunts or groans; the Bell witch made gasping, whispering noises more like anasthmatic cough. Gradually, the voice developed until it was a low but audiblewhisper. It made such remarks as ‘I can’t stand the smell of a nigger’. AndBetsy undoubtedly provided the energy for these demonstrations; she becamefatigued and miserable, short of breath, and subject to fainting spells.Whenever she was unconscious, the voice ceased, which led some neighbours tosuspect that she was a ventriloquist. But, as Nandor Fodor has pointed out, itsounds much more as if she slipped into mediumistic trance. At the same time,John Bell himself began to suffer. His tongue swelled, and his jaw felt stiff asif someone had pushed a stick inside his mouth, pushing on both sides of thejaw. It gradually became worse, until he was often unable to eat for a day at atime. The ‘witch’ also seemed to direct more and more of its malice towards ‘oldJack Bell’, declaring that he would be tormented for the rest of his life.Meanwhile, the voice had graduated from a whisper to a normal voice; it used torepeat bits of the sermons of various local parsons. Then it began using badlanguage—again, a common characteristic of ‘talking ghosts’. In fact, ‘it’talked in several voices. One of its earliest utterances in a normal voice was:‘I am a spirit who was once very happy, but have been disturbed and am nowunhappy.’ And it stated that it would torment John Bell and kill him in the end.It identified itself as an Indian whose bones had been scattered, then as awitch called Old Kate Batts. Then four more voices made their appearance—the‘family’ of the witch; they identified themselves as Blackdog, Mathematics,Cypocryphy and Jerusalem. Blackdog had a harsh, masculine voice, Jerusalem aboy’s voice, while the other two sounded ‘delicate and feminine’. Theyapparently indulged in debauches, talking drunkenly and filling the house withthe smell of whisky.As much as the witch detested John Bell, it seemed to have gentler feelings forthe rest of the family, especially for John Bell’s wife Lucy. When she fell illthe witch lamented ‘Luce, poor Luce’ and showered hazel nuts on her. At Betsy’sbirthday party, it called ‘I have a surprise for you’, and materialised a basketof fruit, including oranges and bananas, which it claimed to have brought fromthe West Indies.A local ‘witch-doctor’ offered to cure Betsy with some revolting medicine whichwould make her vomit; when she duly retched, her vomit was found to be full ofbrass pins and needles. Meanwhile the witch screamed with laughter and said thatif Betsy could be made to vomit again, she would have enough pins and needles toset up a shop.One day in winter, as the children were sitting on a sledge, the witch called‘Hold tight’, and hauled the sledge at great speed round the house three times.It was also able to spit; it had a particular aversion to a negro slave girlcalled Anky, and one day covered her head with a foam like white spittle.It also showed a tendency to interfere in the personal lives of the family. Indue course, Betsy became engaged to a youth called Joshua Gardner. As soon asthe witch found out, she began to whisper: ‘Please, Betsy Bell, don’t haveJoshua Gardner.’ Betsy finally gave in, and returned Joshua’s ring.Meanwhile, the persecution of John Bell became steadily worse. His sufferingssound like the torments of the possessed nuns and priests of Loudun; but theywere of a more physical nature. When he was ill in bed, the witch cursed andraved, using foul language. When he went outside, it followed him and jerked offhis shoes. Then he was struck in the face so hard that he was stunned and had tosit down on a log. His face began to jerk and contort—another of the witch’sfavourite methods of tormenting him—then his body convulsed. His shoes keptflying off, and every time his son Richard put them on they flew off again. Thewitch shrieked with laughter and sang derisive songs (many poltergeists haveshown themselves to be musical, although their taste seldom rises above popularsongs). Finally, the attacks ceased, and the unfortunate man sat there stunned,with the tears rolling down his cheeks. The witch had been tormenting him formore than three years. When they got him back indoors, he took to his bed. OnDecember 19, 1820, he was found to be in a deep stupor. In the medicinecupboard, his son John found a dark bottle one-third full of a smoky-lookingliquid. The witch began to exult: ‘It’s useless for you to try to relieve oldJack—I’ve got him this time.’ Asked about the medicine, the witch replied: ‘Iput it there, and gave old Jack a dose last night while he was asleep, whichfixed him.’ When the doctor arrived, they tested the ‘medicine’ by dipping astraw into it and allowing a drop to fall on the cat’s tongue; the cat jumpedand whirled around, then died. John Bell himself died the next day, while thewitch filled the house with shrieks of triumph, and sang, ‘Row me up somebrandy, O’.As Fodor points out, there is something very odd about this death. The witch hadoften revealed strength enough to strangle Bell, or kill him by hitting him withsome object; yet she never made any such attempt—only, as it were, drove him todespair, then administered some powerful drug when he was probably dying anyway.In most poltergeist cases we may feel that the entity is not particularlymalicious, and that this explains the lack of injury—bullying children oftenthreaten their victims with physical damage, and may even seem to be on thepoint of carrying out their threat; but there is an abyss of difference betweenthe threat—or, perhaps, lashing out with a stick and missing by a hair’sbreadth—and actually causing bodily harm. Yet the Bell Witch seems to have beenmore malicious than most. It leads to the speculation that these entities maynot be ‘allowed’ to do actual harm; they are allowed to torment, but not todamage. This, admittedly, explains nothing; but it is certainly an observationthat has struck everyone who has studied the poltergeist.After the death of John Bell, the witch seemed to lose interest. It apparentlyrefused to help John Jnr to speak to his dead father, declaring that the deadcould not be brought back; but on one occasion, it told John to go to thewindow, on a snowy day, then made footprints appear in the snow, which itclaimed to be identifical with those made by his father’s boots—John did notbother to test this claim.In 1821, four years after the disturbances began (an unusually long period), thefamily was sitting at supper one evening when there was a tremendous noise inthe chimney—as if a cannon-ball had rolled down it and out into the room. Itburst into a ball of smoke. The witch’s voice called: ‘I am going, and will begone for seven years—goodbye to all.’ And the disturbances ceased.Seven years later, only Lucy Bell and two of her sons remained in the homestead;the rest, including Betsy, had married or left. Once again, the manifestationsstarted from the beginning, with scratching noises, then the covers being pulledoff the bed. But the family ignored all this, and after two weeks, themanifestations ceased. John Jnr claimed that the witch paid him two visits inhis new home, and promised to return to one of his descendants in hundred andseven years; but 1935 passed without any direct descendant of the Bell familybeing ‘haunted’.The case of the Bell Witch was fully documented in a book written in 1846 byRichard Bell, who had been seven when the witch first appeared, and was laterthe subject of a full length book by M.V. Ingram (1894). Nandor Fodor, who haswritten extensively on the poltergeist, discusses it fully in his book ThePoltergeist Down the Centuries. As well as being a student of the paranormal,Fodor was also a Freudian psychiatrist, and he takes the view that thepoltergeist is sexual in origin. Undoubtedly, he is partly correct—thepoltergeist seems to be at its best when it can draw on the energies of a girl(or, less often, a boy) who has just reached puberty. But Fodor goes furtherthan this, and suggests that the explanation of the Bell Witch lies in anincestuous attack made on Betsy by her father. This caused Betsy to hate herfather, and her repressed hatred expressed itself in the form of ‘recurrentspontaneous psychokinesis’. He also believes that John Bell felt a deep guiltabout the supposed attack, and cites an occasion when Bell went to dinner withneighbours named Dearden, yet said nothing all evening, seeming depressed andconfused; the next day he rode over specially to explain, saying that his tonguehad been affected as if his mouth had become filled with fungus. This, saysFodor, probably represents ‘self-aggression’.But this theory hardly stands up to examination. As we have seen, poltergeistsoften take a delight in embarrassing people by revealing their most intimatesecrets in public—in the Bell Witch case, it hastened the break-up of Betsy andJoshua by embarrassing them with personal revelations. So it is hard to see whyit should have failed to state publicly that John Bell had committed—or tried tocommit—incest with Betsy. Even if it had said so, we would be justified intreating the accusation with caution: poltergeists are not noted fortruthfulness. The fact that it failed to say so weighs heavily against theincest theory. As to the notion that Betsy’s unconscious aggressions caused thedisturbances this fails to explain why Betsy herself was—at first—treated sobadly. It also fails to explain how the witch managed to return when Betsy hadleft home and was married.Rather more interesting are Fodor’s speculations about the nature of thepoltergeist. He thinks that its denial of communication with the dead provesthat it was not the spirit of a dead person. He is inclined to feel that thewitch was ‘a fragment of a living personality that has broken free in somemysterious way of some of the three-dimensional limitations of the mind of themain personality’. In other words, poltergeists are explainable as fragments ofthe ‘split personality’. But this leaves us exactly where we were before—incomplete ignorance of how the split personality performs its paranormal feats.The truth is that this explanation—about the unconscious mind—sounded far moreconvincing in the 1930s than it does today, when Freud is no longer regarded asinfallible. Moreover, it simply fails to fit the facts of the ‘haunting’. On theother hand, Kardec’s views fit them like a glove. According to The Spirits’Book, only a small proportion of the spirits involved in poltergeist cases arethose of dead people—there are many other kinds. Besides, it seems clear that inthe Bell Witch case, there was not one spirit, but several. So Kardec’sexplanation would be that the haunting in the Bell household was the work of agroup of rowdy and mischievous spirits or ‘elementals’ of no particularintelligence—the other-worldly equivalent of a cageful of monkeys. A house withnine children, many of them teenagers, would provide plenty of the energypoltergeists find necessary to perform their antics. We must suppose that theBell household was not a particularly happy one—this deduction arises from thefact that there is no record of a poltergeist haunting taking place in a happyfamily. No doubt John Bell was a typical 19th century patriarch, dictatorial andbad-tempered; and on a farmstead in a remote rural area, there was no doubtplenty of reason for tension and frustration in the family.As to why the witch disliked John Bell so much, the reason may lie in an eventthat took place very early in the case. Before the first scratching noises wereheard, John Bell saw one day a strange, dog-like creature sitting between twocorn rows, and shot at it. The ‘witch’ stated on a number of occasions that shecould assume the shape of an animal. Poltergeists dislike aggression againstthemselves, and if the strange animal was the witch, then it had a cause forfeeling resentment about John Bell. Apart from that, he was the head of thehousehold, the ‘tyrant’. If the witch was capable of showing generosity andaffection towards various members of the family—Lucy, Betsy, young John—then she(they?) would also dislike the bullying paterfamilias. This is, admittedly,speculation; but it fits better than Fodor’s Freudian guesses.Thirty years after the Bell Witch, there occurred in Stratford, Connecticut, acase that has seems to demonstrate beyond all doubt the inadequacies of Fodor’sFreudian theories.The Stratford minister, the Rev. Eliakim Phelps, had married a widow with fourchildren. He was interested in clairvoyance, and attempted to treat illnesses bymeans of mesmerism. He was understandably excited by the news of the strangeevents at the home of the Fox family in 1849. And in March 1850, when heentertained a visitor from New York, the two of them arranged some kind ofamateur seance, which was not particularly successful, although they managed toobtain a few raps.A few days later, on Sunday March 10, the family returned from church to findthe front door wide open and the place in disorder. Their first assumption wasthat they had been burgled; but inspection showed that nothing had been taken,and a gold watch left on a table was untouched. That afternoon, the family wentoff to church again, but this time the Reverend Phelps stayed behind to keepwatch. He may well have dozed; at all events, nothing disturbed him. But whenthe family returned from church, the place again showed signs of an intruder.Furniture was scattered, and in the main bedroom, a nightgown and chemise hadbeen laid out on the bed, with the arms folded across the breast, and a pair ofstockings placed to make it look like a corpse laid out for burial. In anotherroom, clothing and cushions had been used to make various dummies, which werearranged in a tableau, ‘in attitudes of extreme devotion, some with theirforeheads nearly touching the floor’, and with open Bibles in front of them.Clearly, the poltergeist had a sense of ironic humour.From then on, the Phelps poltergeist practised its skill as a designer oftableaux. The astonishing thing was that these were done so quickly. Oneobserver, a Dr Webster, remarked that it would have taken half a dozen womenseveral hours to construct the ‘dummies’ that the poltergeist made withinminutes. One figure was so life-like that when the 3-year-old boy went into theroom, he thought his mother was kneeling in prayer, and that she whispered ‘Bestill . . .’That it was a poltergeist became clear the following day, when objects began tofly through the air. A bucket flew downstairs, an umbrella leapt through theair, and spoons, bits of tin and keys were thrown around. A candlestick jumpedoff the mantelpiece, then beat the floor violently until it broke. There wereloud pounding noises as if someone was trying to demolish the house with an axe,and loud screams.The poltergeist probably derived its strength from the fact that it had two‘focuses’ in the house—Harry, aged 12, and Anna, who was 16. Harry waspersecuted by the ‘spirit’. When he went for a drive in the carriage with hisstepfather, twenty stones were flung into the carriage. On one occasion he wassnatched up into the air so that his head nearly struck the ceiling; he wasthrown into a cistern of water, and tied up and suspended from a tree. In frontof a visiting clergyman, the legs of his trousers were violently torn open fromthe bottom to above the knee.After this, the poltergeist started to break glass; it smashed seventy-onewindow panes and various glass articles. Another of its favourite tricks was towrite on sheets of paper; when the Reverend Phelps turned his back on hiswriting table, he heard the scratching of the pen, and found written on thepaper: ‘Very nice paper and nice ink for the devil.’ (Typically, poltergeistsseem to object to being watched while they do things like this; they wait untilno one is looking.)Phelps tried communicating with the ‘spirit’ by means of raps, and found that itwould answer his questions. There seemed to be more than one spirit present; butthe author of most of the mischief seemed to be a French clerk, who had handleda settlement for Mrs Phelps, and who had since died; he now claimed to be inhell because he had cheated Mrs Phelps. Her husband investigated this claim, andfound that there had been a minor fraud; but it had hardly been as serious asthe ‘spirit’ seemed to believe. On another occasion the raps told Phelps to puthis hand under the table; when he did this his hand was grasped by another hand,warm and human.The well-known psychic Andrew Jackson Davis visited the Phelps home, and putforward a theory very similar to that of Mrs Crowe. He said that the phenomenawere caused by ‘magnetism’ and by ‘electricity’, the magnetism attractingobjects towards the boy and girl, the electricity causing them to fly in theopposite direction. But Davis—the author of the bestselling work of ‘spiritdictation’ called The Principles of Nature—also agreed that there were spiritspresent—he claimed to have seen five of them.The poltergeist—or poltergeists—became increasingly destructive. Pieces of paperburst into flame, although always where they could be seen; sometimes, the ashesof burnt papers were found in drawers. All kinds of objects were smashed—Phelpsestimated that the poltergeist had done about two hundred dollars’ worth ofdamage. And the poltergeist also attacked the eldest girl, Anna. A reporter wassitting with the mother and daughter when the girl shouted that someone hadpinched her; they rolled up her sleeve and found a severe fresh pinch mark onher arm. On another occasion, there was a loud smacking noise, and a red markappeared on her face.In October 1851, more than a year after the disturbances began, the mother andchildren went off to Pennsylvania and stayed there until the following spring.The poltergeist did not follow them, and when they returned to Stratford,nothing more happened.What seems very clear is that the poltergeist haunting would never have takenplace if the Rev. Phelps had not made the mistake of dabbling in an amateurseance. Presumably this attracted the attention of some juvenile delinquents ofthe spirit world, who discovered that there were two excellent mediums in thehouse, and proceeded to make use of their energies. When Mrs Phelps took thechildren away, the poltergeist was starved of energy and went away. Here itseems obvious that the ‘Freudian’ explanation is both unnecessary andirrelevant.The Phelps case has been described as ‘one of the most amazing poltergeistdramas of which we have record’.1 In fact, most students of the paranormal wouldagree that this distinction should go to the case that has become known as ‘theAmherst mystery’, which took place in Nova Scotia in 1878.A shoe worker named Daniel Teed lived in a two-storey house with his wife andtwo sons, his wife’s two unmarried sisters, Jane and Esther Cox, who were aged22 and 18, his wife’s brother William, and his own brother, John. (The housemust have been grossly overcrowded.) All were Methodists. Jane, the eldersister, was pretty; Esther was short and rather stout. Nevertheless, Esther hada boyfriend, a local factory worker named Bob MacNeal.In late August, Daniel Teed complained that someone had been milking the cow;Esther was a suspect as she was unusually fond of milk. Esther was sufferingfrom nervous tensions, and ran up from the cellar one night screaming that a rathad run over her leg. Her troubles were probably sexual in origin, as seems tobe revealed by a dream she had at the time: hundreds of black bulls with brightblue eyes and blood dripping from their mouths tried to break into the house,while Esther frantically locked the doors . . .The following evening, Esther and Bob MacNeal went out for a drive. Bob, who hada bad reputation locally, tried to persuade Esther to go into the woods withhim, but she refused. He pulled out a gun and ordered her to get down from thebuggy; he looked as if he might fire when the sound of an approaching vehicledistracted him. He leapt on to the buggy, drove back at a dangerous speed, letEsther off, then left Amherst for good. Esther cried herself to sleep, and forthe next few days had red eyes.On September 4, a damp, misty evening, Jane heard Esther sobbing in bed. ThenEsther screamed that there was a mouse in bed with her. They searched, but nomouse was found. The following night, both heard a rustling noise, and made asearch. It seemed to be coming from a cardboard box containing patchwork, soJane stood it in the middle of the room, expecting a mouse to run out. Insteadthe box jumped into the air and fell over. She stood it up, and it jumped again.Daniel Teed came in to see what the noise was about, pushed the box under thebed, and told them to go to sleep.The next night, Esther went to bed early. Soon after the light went out, sheleapt out of bed shouting: ‘Jane, I’m dying.’ Jane lit the lamp and saw thatEsther’s face was bright red, and her hair was standing on end. Daniel Teed camein, together with the other two men. Esther got back into bed, but began toscream. Her body appeared to be swelling like a balloon. Suddenly, there was aloud report like a clap of thunder. The men rushed out to search the house, butfound nothing. When they came back, Esther was back to normal and fast asleep.Two days later, as Esther was getting into bed, she began to feel ill again. Allthe bedclothes flew off the bed, and landed in the far corner of the room. Janefainted. Esther began to swell again. The men rushed in, and someone replacedthe bedclothes; they promptly flew off again, and a pillow hit John Teed on thehead; he left the house never to return. Again, there were some loud explosions.Esther stopped swelling, and fell asleep.The following day, a doctor came to see Esther. As she lay in bed, the pillowunder her head inflated, as if filled up with air, then collapsed, thenre-inflated itself. Raps sounded around the room. The bedclothes flew off. Therewas a scratching noise above Esther’s bed and, as they all watched, they sawwriting appearing on the wall. It said: ‘Esther, you are mine to kill.’ A lumpof plaster detached itself from elsewhere on the wall and flew across the roomto the doctor’s feet. Then rappings and bangs continued for the next two hours,while Esther lay, terrified, on her bed.The following day, Esther complained of an ‘electric’ feeling running throughher body. The doctor gave her morphine; instantly, there was a series of bangsand crashes that seemed to go up to the roof.These disturbances continued for another three weeks. Then, one night, Estherfell into a trance, became rigid, and told the story of what had happened withBob MacNeal. When she recovered consciousness, she admitted it was true. WhenJane said that Bob must be responsible for Esther’s problems, loud knockssuggested that the ‘spirit’ agreed completely. Jane remarked that it seemed tounderstand what she said, whereupon there were three distinct raps. The doctortried asking the ‘spirit’ simple questions, with one rap for no, two for ‘noanswer’, three for yes. But the doctor’s attempts to get it to explain itselfwere a total failure.Esther became a subject of controversy; the house was permanently full ofpeople. When a minister called to see her, a bucket of cold water on the kitchentable began to bubble as if it was boiling.In December, Esther developed a severe sore throat which turned to diphtheria.While she was ill, the manifestations ceased. Then she went away to convalesce.When she returned, the manifestations started immediately. Esther said she hearda voice telling her that the house was going to be set on fire. As she told theothers about this, a lighted match fell from the air on to the bed, and thesheets caught fire. Jane quickly put it out. More lighted matches fell aroundthe room, most of them going out immediately. The rapping noises started later,and when the family asked the ‘spirit’ whether the house would be set alight, itreplied that it would not be. At that moment there was smoke from under Esther’sbed; they found that a dress had somehow transferred itself from the bedroomdoor, and had been set on fire.Three days later, Mrs Teed smelled smoke coming from the cellar. They found abarrel of wood shavings burning vigorously and had some trouble putting it out.The villagers were alarmed about this; if the Teeds’ house caught fire, half thevillage would probably be burned down. They suggested that Esther ought to besent away. A neighbour named John White offered to take her in if she would dosome housework. For two weeks, all went well; then a scrubbing brush flew out ofEsther’s hand, went up to the ceiling, and came down and hit her on the head.White owned a restaurant, and Esther went to work there. An oven door refused tostay closed, and jumped off its hinges. Metal objects began flying at Esther asif she were a magnet, and a boy’s clasp-knife made her back bleed. When ironspikes were laid in her lap, they quickly became too hot to touch.All this seemed to support the suspicion that Esther was somehow ‘electrified’.They tried making her wear a special pair of shoes with glass soles; but thesegave her headaches and made her nose bleed.When furniture began to move around the restaurant, John White decided it wastime for Esther to go home. Again, she left Amherst for a few months; first tostay with a man and his wife in New Brunswick, then to a farm three miles fromAmherst. She told various visitors about the ‘voices’ that spoke to her—voiceswhich claimed to be the spirits that were causing the mischief. One of thesespirits, ‘Bob Nickle’, threatened her with fire and stabbing.In June, 1879, a stage magician named Walter Hubbell moved into the Teeds’cottage as a paying guest; he had heard about the ‘haunting’ and thought itmight make the subject of a book. Within a few minutes of arriving, he had nodoubt that this was no fraud. His umbrella sailed through the air, then acarving knife landed at his feet, then his bag was ‘thrown’, then a chair shotacross the room and hit his own so hard that he nearly fell on the floor. Fromthen on, the chairs in every room he entered performed a dance. Esther told himhe was unpopular with the spirits. Undeterred, Hubbell tried asking themquestions by means of raps, and the spirits were able to tell him the numberengraved on his watch, and the dates of coins in his pockets. Later, Hubbell laydown on the settee and closed his eyes; Esther came into the room, and Hubbellcautiously peeped at her, perhaps hoping that she would give herself away as acheat. Instead, he saw a large glass paperweight float up across the room andrebound off the arm of the settee.During the next few days the poltergeist put on a special show for Hubbell.Objects floated around, strange noises were heard—like sawing wood and drummingon a washboard—and Esther was attacked by ‘six spirits’ who stuck no fewer thanthirty pins in her. Small fires broke out—on one day there were forty-five ofthem—and the sound of a trumpet echoed through the house; they later found asmall silver trumpet which no one had ever seen before. When Esther went to thelocal minister to pray, ‘Bob Nickle’ attacked her viciously on her return,cutting her head open with a bone and stabbing her in the face with a fork.Hubbell thought he saw a way of making money. He hired a hall and persuadedEsther to put on a ‘show’ for the people of Amherst. Inevitably, the spiritsdeclined to operate, and the audience demanded their money back.Tired of the non-stop disturbances, Daniel Teed sent Esther off to stay withsome obliging friends; Hubbell, who now had enough material for his book, wentto St John to write it. It appeared in due course and went through severaleditions.During Esther’s stay with her friends, the spirits let her alone. She then tooka job on a farm owned by people called Davidson. Her friends found that variousarticles were missing, and these were located in the Davidsons’ barn. Esther wassuspected of theft, but before the case could be investigated the barn caughtfire and burned to the ground. Esther was accused of arson, and was sentenced tofour months in jail. After this, the manifestations came suddenly to an end.This abrupt termination of the ‘haunting’ seems to favour the view that Esther’sown unconscious mind was responsible. This is, in fact, the view I favoured whenI described the case briefly in a book called Mysteries. Esther was sexuallyfrustrated, and if Bob MacNeal had adopted a more gentlemanly way of seducingher, there would have been no ‘Great Amherst Mystery’ (the title of Hubbell’sbook). Esther was a classic case of ‘the divided self: a part of her longing togive herself to her lover, while the inhibitions induced by her background andtraining made this impossible. So when she rejected his advances, and hevanished into the night, her unconscious mind said, in effect: ‘Now see whatyou’ve done, stupid!’, and set out to punish her. As to the effects themselves,many of them fit the hypothesis I have suggested: that the ‘energy’ comes fromthe earth. When Esther wore shoes with glass soles, the manifestations stoppedbut she developed headaches and nosebleeds. Her sensation of electric currentsis also highly suggestive. There have been dozens of well-authenticated cases of‘human electric batteries’. Again, nearly all concern girls or boys at the ageof puberty. Caroline Clare of Bondon, Ontario, began to lose weight at the ageof seventeen (in 1877), then developed such powerful electric currents thatpeople who touched her received severe shocks; pieces of metal stuck to her asif she were a magnet. Jennie Morgan of Sedalia, Missouri, became an electricbattery at fourteen; when she touched metal objects, sparks flew. FrankMcKinistry, also of Missouri, would develop an electric charge during the nightand slowly lose it during the day. When highly charged, his feet would stiek tothe ground so that he had difficulty in walking—which sounds again as if theelectricity comes from the earth. (Good dowsers receive a ‘tingling’ sensationwhen they touch standing stones.) The Amherst minister, the Reverend Edwin Clay,was convinced that the secret of Esther’s manifestations was electricity, andeven delivered a lecture to that effect.But how did Esther’s unconscious mind know the number of Hubbell’s watch and thedates of coins in his pocket—which no doubt he did not know himself? How did hermind scratch ‘Esther, you are mine to kill’ on the wall above her head? How didit blow a trumpet all over the house? The truth is that the unconscious mindtheory needs to be stretched so much that it loses the chief virtue of a goodtheory—simplicity.But perhaps the strongest argument against the unconscious mind theory is simplythat Esther’s torment went on for so long. To actually read the case in detailis to feel that no one could get so angry with herself that she would continuerelentlessly for more than a year. We may say, ‘Oh, I could kick myself,’ whenwe do something stupid; but no one has ever done it.The fraud hypothesis also fails to stand up to close examination. If Hubbell’sbook was the main piece of evidence, then we might well feel suspicious, sincehe went to Amherst with the hope of writing it, and eventually made a great dealof money from no fewer than ten editions. But there are accounts in the AmherstGazette that confirm everything Hubbell says. Moreover, in 1907, more than aquarter of a century after the events, the researcher Hereward Carrington wentto Amherst and took various depositions from people who had witnessed themanifestations. By this time, Esther was unhappily married, and had turned intoa sullen middle-aged woman, who agreed to talk to Carrington only on the paymentof $100; Carrington felt that such testimony would be valueless. But there couldbe no doubt that most of the people involved believed that the manifestationswere genuine, including the farmer, Davidson, whose barn had been destroyed—hesaid that he had often watched Esther as she came downstairs and had noticedthat she seemed to fly or float. (In the Middle Ages, levitation used to be oneof the criteria for demoniacal possession.)But this question of demoniacal possession must be left until a later chapter.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

He was an unlikelyinvestigator because he was known throughout Europe as a hard-line sceptic andmaterialist. And this, in turn, was due to the fact that he had been born—in1835—in Verona, which was then a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, which wasRoman Catholic. And since Lombroso was a Jewish Italian, he naturally hated theAustrians and their religion. His distaste was increased by several years underJesuit schoolmasters—he felt they were trying to thrust him back into the MiddleAges. When he discovered science, he took to it like a duck to water—the simileis painfully hackneyed, but in this case gives an accurate sense of hisenthusiasm. By the time Lombroso was 30, Garibaldi had freed Italy from thestranglehold of Austria—and Roman Catholicism—and Lombroso could proclaim hismaterialism without danger of finding himself in jail. Lombroso himself hadplayed a small part in freeing Italy by serving in the army as a surgeon.When he became a Professor of Psychiatry at Pavia, and the director of a lunaticasylum in Pesaro, he set out to try and prove that insanity is a purely physicalillness—he had to believe this, of course, since (as a good materialist) he didnot believe that the mind exists. He spent years studying the brains of madmenand carefully staining their nerve fibres, in an attempt to track down the‘germ’ of insanity—without success. Then he learned that the German physiologistVerchow had discovered certain ‘atavistic’ features about the skulls ofcriminals—that is, that they have a touch of the cave-man about them. This wasthe clue he had been looking for. He proceeded to make a careful study of theinmates in the local prison, and at the age of 41, announced to the world hisdiscovery that the criminal is a throwback to our cave-man ancestors, a kind ofhuman ape. In other words, a man born with these tendencies can no more helpcommitting crimes than a born cripple can help limping. The book Criminal Man(L’Uomo Delinquente) made him famous throughout Europe. Naturally, it gaveviolent offence to the Catholic Church, which has always felt that wickedness isa matter of choice; but it also upset psychologists, who liked to feel that manpossesses at least an atom of freewill.Yet in spite of his reputation for aggressive materialism, Lombroso was too gooda scientist not to be willing to study new facts. And in 1882, he encountered acase that baffled him. A teenage girl had apparently developed some ratherpeculiar powers—although it sounded too silly to be taken seriously. Accordingto her parents, she could see through her ear and smell through her chin. WhenLombroso went to see her, he expected to find some absurd deception.She was a tall, thin girl of 14, and the trouble had begun when she started tomenstruate. She began sleep-walking, and developed hysterical blindness. Yet shewas still able to see through the tip of her nose, and through her left ear.Lombroso tried binding her eyes with a bandage, then took a letter out of hispocket and held it a few inches away from her nose; she read it as if her eyeswere uncovered. To make sure she was not peeping under the bandages, Lombrosoheld another page near her left ear; again, she read it aloud withoutdifficulty. And even without the bandage, she would not have been able to read aletter held at the side of her head.Next he tried holding a bottle of strong smelling salts under her nose; it didnot make the slightest impression. But when it was held under her chin, shewinced and gasped. He tried substances with only the slightest trace ofodour—substances he could not smell if he held them two inches away from his ownnose. When they were under her chin, she could identify every one of them.If he still had any doubts, they vanished during the next few weeks when hersense of smell suddenly transferred itself to the back of her foot. Ifdisagreeable smells were brought close to her heel, she writhed in agony;pleasant ones made her sigh with delight.This was not all. The girl also developed the power of prediction. She was ableto predict weeks ahead precisely when she would have fits, and exactly how theycould be cured. Lombroso, naturally, did not accept this as genuine prediction,since she might have been inducing the fits—consciously or otherwise—to make herpredictions come true. But she then began to predict things that would happen toother members of the family; and these came about just as she had foretold.In medical journals, Lombroso found many similar cases. One girl who developedhysterical symptoms at puberty could accurately distinguish colours with herhands. An 11-year-old girl who suffered a back wound was able to hear throughher elbow. Another pubescent girl could read a book with her stomach when hereyes were bandaged. Another hysterical woman developed X-ray eyes, and said shecould see worms in her intestines—she actually counted them and said there werethirty-three; in due course she excreted precisely this number of worms. A youngman suffering from hysteria could read people’s minds, and reproduce drawingsand words written on a sheet of paper when his eyes were tightly bandaged.Lombroso may have been a determined materialist; but he was willing to study thefacts. And the facts led him into stranger and stranger regions of speculation.To begin with, he developed a simple and ingenious theory of the humanfaculties, pointing out that seeing, hearing, smelling and feeling all takeplace through the nerves, and that if one of these faculties becomes paralysed,there is no scientific reason why another should not take over. When he attendeda seance with the famous ‘medium’ Eusapia Palladino, and saw a table floating upinto the air, he simply extended his theory, and argued that there is no reasonwhy ‘psychological force’ should not change into ‘motor force’. But when hebegan to study other cases of prediction and ‘second sight’, he had to admitthat it became increasingly difficult to keep the explanations within the boundsof materialistic science. There was the case of a woman who refused to stay in atheatre because she suddenly had a conviction that her father was dying; she gothome and found a telegram to that effect. A doctor who suffered from hystericalsymptoms foresaw the great fire of 1894 at the Como Exposition, and persuadedhis family to sell their shares in a fire insurance company which had to meetthe claims; when the fire occurred, his family were glad they took his advice. Awoman whose daughter was playing near a railway line heard a voice telling herthe child was in danger; she fetched her indoors half an hour before a trainjumped the rails and ploughed through the spot where her daughter had beenplaying.Slowly, and with painful reluctance, the sceptical scientist was converted tothe view that the world was a far more complex place than his theories allowed.His colleagues were outraged. His biographer and translator, Hans Kurella, cameto the conclusion that this was all a painful aberration due to the decay of hisfaculties—an argument difficult to sustain, since Lombroso was only 47 when hebecame interested in these matters, and he lived for more than a quarter of acentury longer. Kurella can only bring himself to mention ‘Lombroso’sSpiritualistic Researches’ in a short afterword to his biography, and hiscomments are scathing. Talking about Eusapia Palladino, whose seances he hadattended, he agreed that she was indeed a ‘miracle’—’a miracle of adroitness,false bonhomie, well-simulated candour, naivety and artistic command of all thesymptoms of hysterico-epilepsy’. Which may well be true, but still does notexplain how she was able to make a table rise up into the air when Lombroso andother scientists were holding her hands and feet.Lombroso struggled manfully to stay within the bounds of science; he devised allkinds of ingenious instruments for testing mediums during seances. But, littleby little, he found himself sucked into that ambiguous, twilit world of the‘paranormal’. Having studied mediums in civilised society, he turned hisattention to tribal witch-doctors and shamans, and found that they could producethe same phenomena. But they always insisted that they did this with the help ofthe ‘spirit world’—the world of the dead. And the more he looked into this, themore convincing it began to appear. And so, finally, he turned his attention tothe topic that every good scientist dismisses as an old wives’ tale: hauntedhouses. Here again, personal experience soon convinced him of their reality.His most celebrated case concerned a wine shop in the Via Bava in Turin. InNovember 1900, he heard interesting rumours about how a destructive ghost wasmaking life very difficult for the family of the proprietor, a Signor Fumero.Bottles smashed, tables and chairs danced about, kitchen utensils flew acrossthe room. So Lombroso went along to the wine shop, and asked the proprietor ifthere was any truth in the stories. Indeed there was, said Fumero, but thedisturbances had now stopped. Professor Lombroso had visited the house, and theghost had now gone away. ‘You interest me extremely,’ replied Lombroso. ‘Allowme to introduce myself.’ And he presented his card. Fumero looked deeplyembarrassed, and admitted that the story about Lombroso was an invention,intended to discourage the curious. For it seemed that the Italian police hadbeen called in, and that they had witnessed the strange disturbances and toldSignor Fumero that, unless this stopped at once, he would find himself inserious trouble. So Fumero had invented this story of how the famous ProfessorLombroso had visited the house, and the ghost had taken his departure.In fact, the proprietor admitted, the ghost was as active as ever; and if theprofessor would care to see with his own eyes, he only had to step down to thecellar.Down below the house was a deep wine-cellar, approached by a flight of stairsand a long passageway. The proprietor led the way. The cellar was in completedarkness; but as they entered there was a noise of smashing glass, and somebottles struck Lombroso’s foot. A lighted candle revealed rows of shelves withbottles of wine. And as Lombroso stood there, three empty bottles began to spinacross the floor, and shattered against the leg of a table that stood in themiddle of the cellar. On the floor, below the shelves, were the remains ofbroken bottles and wine. Lombroso took the candle over to the shelves, andexamined them closely to see if there could be invisible wires to cause themovement. There were none; but as he looked, half a dozen bottles gently rosefrom the shelves, as if someone had lifted them, and exploded on the floor.Finally, as they left the cellar and closed the door behind them, they heard thesmashing of another bottle.The cellar was not the only place in the house where these things occurred.Chairs and plates flew around the kitchen. In the servants’ room, a brassgrinding machine flew across the room so violently that it was flattened out ofshape; Lombroso examined it with amazement. The force to flatten it must havebeen considerable; if it had struck someone’s head, it would surely have killedhim. The odd thing was that the ghost seemed to do no one any harm. On oneoccasion, as the proprietor was bending down in the cellar, a large bottle ofwine had burst beside his head; if it had struck him it would have done him asevere injury. Moreover, the ‘entity’ seemed to have the power to make bottles‘explode’ without dropping them. They would hear a distinct cracking sound; thena bottle would fly into splinters.Now Lombroso knew enough about hauntings to know that this was not an ordinaryghost. The ordinary ghost stays around in a house for many years, perhaps forcenturies, and manifests itself to many people. But this bottle-smashing ghostwas of the kind that the Germans call a poltergeist—or noisy spirit. Such‘hauntings’ usually last only a short period—seldom more than six months—andthey often seem to be associated with a ‘medium’—that is, with some particularperson who ‘causes’ them, in exactly the same way that Eusapia Palladino causeda table to rise into the air.In this case, Lombroso suspected the wife of Signor Fumero, a skinny littlewoman of 50, who seemed to him to be distinctly neurotic. She admitted that eversince infancy she had been subject to neuralgia, nervous tremors andhallucinations; she had also had an operation to remove her ovaries. Ever sincethe case of the girl who could see with her ear, Lombroso had noticed that thesepeople with peculiar ‘powers’ seemed to be nervously unstable. He thereforeadvised Signor Fumero to try sending his wife for a holiday. She went back toher native town for three days, and during that period, the wine shop wasblessedly quiet—although Signora Fumero suffered from hallucinations while shewas away, believing she could see people who were invisible to everyone else.It looked as if Lombroso had stumbled on the correct solution. But it was not sosimple. On Signora Fumero’s return, all the disturbances began again; so, tomake doubly sure, Lombroso again suggested that she should go home for a fewdays. The poor woman was understandably irritated at being banished from herhome on account of the spirits; and before she left, she cursed them vigorously.That apparently annoyed them, for this time the disturbances went on while shewas away. On the day she left, a pair of her shoes came floating out of herbedroom and down the stairs, and landed at the feet of some customers who weredrinking in the bar. The following day the shoes vanished completely, toreappear under the bed a week later. Worse still, plates and bottles in thekitchen exploded or fell on the floor. But Signor Fumero noticed an interestingfact. It was only the plates and bottles that had been touched by his wife thatsmashed. If another woman set the table—preferably in another place—nothinghappened. It was almost as if the objects she had touched had picked up someform of energy from her . . .So his wife came back from her home town, and the disturbances continued asbefore. A bottle of soda water rose up gently in the bar, floated across theroom as if someone were carrying it, and smashed on the floor.It seemed, then, that Signora Fumero was not to blame; at least, not entirely.So who was? There were only three other suspects. Signor Fumero could bedismissed—he was a ‘brave old soldier’, and not at all the hysterical type.There was a head waiter, who seemed to be an ordinary, typical Italian. Butthere was also a young waiter—a lad of thirteen, unusually tall . . . Lombrosomay have recalled that the girl who could see through her ear was also unusuallytall, and that she had grown about six inches in a year immediately before herproblems began. This boy had also reached puberty.Accordingly, he was dismissed. And the ‘haunting’ of number 6 Via Bavaimmediately ceased.As a scientist, Lombroso’s problem was to find an explanation that would coverthe facts. At a fairly early stage, he was convinced that they were facts, andnot delusions. He wrote to a friend in 1891:‘I am ashamed and sorrowful that with so much obstinacy I have contested thepossibility of the so-called spiritualistic facts. I say the facts, for I aminclined to reject the spiritualistic theory; but the facts exist, and asregards facts I glory in saying that I am their slave.’By ‘spiritualistic theory’ he meant belief in life after death. At this stage hewas inclined to believe that he was dealing with some kind of purely mentalforce.Lombroso’s study of hypnotism had convinced him of the reality of thoughttransference (or telepathy), and he went on to make the startling suggestionthat thought itself could make objects fly through the air.‘I see nothing inadmissible in the supposition that in hysterical and hypnotisedpersons the stimulation of certain centres, which become powerful owing to theparalysing of all the others, and thus give rise to a transposition andtransmission of psychical forces, may also result in a transformation intoluminous or motor force.’He compared it to the action of a magnet in deflecting a compass needle. But tenyears later he had come to recognise that this theory failed to cover ‘thefacts’. It might be stretched to cover the case of the wine-shop poltergeist, ifthe young waiter was an ‘unconscious’ medium, and was using his ‘magneticpowers’ without realising it. But by that time, Lombroso had also studied manycases of haunted houses. And he concluded that there are basically two types:those like the Via Bava, in which there is a ‘medium’ (and which usually lastonly a few weeks or months), and the more traditional haunting, which may lastfor centuries. Lombroso apparently never had a chance to study this second typedirectly, but he went about collecting evidence from witnesses he judgedreliable. When he heard about Glenlee, a haunted house in Scotland, he asked afriend named Professor Scott Elliott to investigate. Elliott went to see a girlwho had lived in the house, and sent Lombroso the following story: Glenlee wasowned by a family called Maxwell, and was supposed to be haunted by the ghost ofa lady who had poisoned her husband. A visitor named Mrs Stamford Raffles waslying in bed beside her husband when she saw—in the firelight—a cloud of mist,which gradually turned into the shape of an old woman. The room became icy-cold.The old woman seemed to be looking at the clock on the mantelpiece. Anothervisitor, Mrs Robert Gladstone, had the same experience—but during the day, withthe sun shining: the same cloud of mist, the same old woman looking at theclock.Since the stories cited by Lombroso are second-hand, and lacking in the kind ofprecise detail that is to be found in that of the wine shop, let me offer here acase of haunting that provides a better comparison. It is to be found in LordHalifax’s Ghost Book.In the 1890s, the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould published in the CornhillMagazine a ‘true ghost story’ about a house in Lille. A Mrs Pennyman, who hadbeen involved in the case, wrote a long letter in which she corrected theinaccuracies of Baring-Gould’s account. Her own is as follows:In 1865, when she was a girl, Mrs Pennyman’s family had gone to France so thatthe children could learn French; and they rented a house in Lille, where theyhad a number of introductions. The rent of the house—in the Place du Liond’Or—struck them as remarkably low. When they went to the bank to cash a letterof credit, they found out why. The place was reputed to have a revenant—a ghost.In fact, the girl and her mother had been awakened by footsteps overhead, buthad assumed it was a servant moving about. After the visit to the bank, theyenquired who was sleeping overhead, and were told that it was an empty garret.Their maid soon heard the story of the revenant from the French servants. Ayoung man who was heir to the house had disappeared under mysteriouscircumstances. The story had it that he had been confined in an iron cage in theattic by his uncle, who later killed him. The uncle sold the house, but it hadnever been occupied for long because of the ghost.The family went to look in the garret, and found that there was a cage. It waseight feet high and four feet square, and was attached to the wall. Inside therewas an iron collar on a rusty chain.Ten days later, the maidservant asked if she could change rooms. She and anothermaid slept in a room between the main stairs and the back staircase, and whichtherefore had two doors. They had seen a tall, thin man walking through theroom, and had buried their faces under the bedclothes. The mother told the maidsto move into another bedroom.Soon after this, the girl and her brother went upstairs to fetch something fromtheir mother’s room, and saw ‘a thin figure in a powdering gown and wearing hairdown the back’ going up the stairs in front of them. They thought it was aservant called Hannah, and called after her, ‘You can’t frighten us.’ But whenthey got back to their mother, she told them that Hannah had gone to bed with aheadache; they checked and found her fast asleep. When they described thefigure, the maids said that it was the one which they had seen.Another brother came from university to stay. He was awakened by a noise, andlooked out of the door to see a man on the stairs. He assumed his mother hadsent a servant to see if he had put out his candle, and was angry about it. Hismother told him she had not sent anyone.By now, the family had found themselves another house. Some English friendsnamed Atkyns called a few days before they left, and were interested to hearabout the ghost. Mrs Atkyns volunteered to sleep in the room with her dog. Thenext morning, Mrs Atkyns looked tired and distraught. She had also seen the manwandering through the bedroom. The dog seems to have refused to attack it.Just before they left the house, the girl herself saw the ghost. By this timethey were so accustomed to the footsteps that they ignored them; but they kept acandle burning in their room. She woke up to see a tall, thin figure in a longgown, its arm resting on a chest of drawers. She could clearly see the face,which was that of a young man with a melancholy expression. When she lookedagain, he had disappeared. The bedroom door was locked.This was the story as told by Mrs Pennyman. Lord Halifax sent it to the ReverendBaring-Gould, who later sent him a letter he received from a reader of hisaccount in the Cornhill Magazine. From this letter, it appeared that the hauntedhouse had been transformed into a hotel in the 1880s. The reader—alady—described how she and two friends had stayed at the Hotel du Lion d’Or inMay 1887, and it is clear that one of the bedrooms they were given was the roomin which the two servant girls had seen the ghost. The lady herself slept in thenext room, and settled down after dinner to write letters. The hotel was veryquiet—they were apparently the only guests—but towards midnight she heardfootsteps on the landing outside the door. Then one of the ladies in the nextbedroom—which was connected to her own—tapped on the door and asked if she wasall right; she had been awakened by footsteps walking up and down. The twoladies unlocked the door and peered out on to the landing; but there was no onethere, and no sound either. So they went back to bed. As she fell asleep, thelady continued to hear the slow, dragging steps which seemed to come fromoutside her door. They left Lille the next morning, and she thought no moreabout the experience until she read Baring-Gould’s account in the Cornhill andrealised that she had probably heard the ghost of the Place du Lion d’Or.Stories of this type inevitably raise suspicions in the mind of the scientificinvestigator; they sound just a little too dramatic to be true—the young manconfined in an iron cage, and so on. Yet since the foundation of the Society forPsychical Research in 1882, thousands of well-authenticated cases have beenrecorded. Sir Ernest Bennett’s Apparitions and Haunted Houses, for example,contains more than a hundred carefully documented cases, and many of these havethe same suspiciously dramatic air that suggests an active imagination. Casefive will serve as an illustration: a General Barter of County Cork describesseeing the ghost of a certain Lieutenant B in India—riding on a pony in themoonlight, complete with two Hindu servants. When the general said: ‘Hello, whatthe devil do you want?’ the ghost came to a halt and looked down at him; and thegeneral noticed that he now had a beard, and that his face was fatter than whenhe knew him some years before. Another officer who had known Lieutenant Bimmediately before his death, later verified that he had grown a beard andbecome stout, and that the pony he was riding had been purchased at Peshawur(where he died of some sickness) and killed through reckless riding.It certainly sounds a highly unlikely story. Yet it is confirmed (in writing) byan officer to whom the general told it immediately afterwards, by the general’swife, and by a major. The wife also states that they heard a horse galloping atbreakneck speed around their house at night on several occasions, and adds thatthe house was built by Lieutenant B. Finally, Bennett himself confirmed with thewar office that Lieutenant B had died at Peshawur in January 1854. So althoughonly General Barter saw the ghost, the evidence for the truth of his story seemsstrong. Other ghosts cited by Bennett were witnessed by many people—for example,the ghost of a chimney sweep who died of cancer, and who returned to his cottageevery night for two months, until the whole family (including five children)began to take it for granted.It is worth noting that nearly all ghosts mentioned in the records of theSociety for Psychical Research look like ordinary, solid human beings; so itseems probable that most people have at some time seen a ghost without realisingit. The late T.C. Lethbridge has described in his book Ghost and Ghoul how, whenhe was about to leave a friend’s room at Cambridge in 1922, he saw a man in atop-hat come into the room—he presumed it was a college porter who had to give amessage. The next day he asked his friend what the porter wanted, and the friendflatly denied that anyone had come into the room as Lethbridge went out. It thenstruck Lethbridge that the man had been wearing hunting kit. If he had nothappened to mention it to his friend, he would never have known that he had seena ghost.Now Lombroso, who died in 1909, gradually abandoned his scepticism, and came toaccept the ‘spiritualistic hypothesis’—that ghosts are, quite simply, spirits ofthe dead, and that the same probably applies to poltergeists, even though thesecan only manifest themselves when there is a ‘medium’ present. The title of hisbook about his researches—which was published posthumously—was AfterDeath—What?—a question that would have struck him as regrettably sensationaltwenty years earlier. In other words, Lombroso made no clear distinction betweenpoltergeists and ‘apparitions’. But even in 1909, this assumption would havebeen widely questioned. One of the most obvious things that emerged from thethousands of cases recorded by the SPR was that the majority of ghosts do notseem to notice the onlookers. (In this respect, General Barter’s case was anexception.) In fact, they behave exactly as if they are a kind of filmprojection. They wander across a room looking anxious—like the ghost of the Liond’Or—as if re-enacting some event from the past. This led a number of eminentinvestigators—among them Sir Oliver Lodge—to suggest that some ghosts, at anyrate, may be no more than a kind of ‘recording’. In Man and the Universe, Lodgewrites:Occasionally a person appears able to respond to stimuli embedded . . . amongpsycho-physical surroundings in a manner at present ill-understood and almostincredible:—as if strong emotions could be unconsciously recorded in matter [myitalics], so that the deposit shall thereafter affect a sufficiently sensitiveorganism and cause similar emotions to reproduce themselves in hissub-consciousness, in a manner analogous to the customary consciousinterpretation of photographic or phonographic records, and indeed of picturesor music and artistic embodiment generally.‘Take, for example, a haunted house . . . wherein some one room is the scene ofa ghostly representation of some long past tragedy. On a psychometric hypothesisthe original tragedy has been literally photographed on its materialsurroundings, nay, even on the ether itself, by reason of the intensity ofemotion felt by those who enacted it; and thenceforth in certain persons anhallucinatory effect is experienced corresponding to such an impression. It isthis theory that is made to account for the feeling one has on entering certainrooms, that there is an alien presence therein, though it is invisible andinaudible to mortal sense . . .’But why should this ‘hallucinatory effect’ be produced on only certain persons?Why not everybody? The answer lies in those words ‘psychometric hypothesis’.Lodge is talking about the theory of Buchanan and Denton we examined in Chapter3 [../Text/08_chapter03.html]. And of course, only certain persons can hold anobject in their hands and ‘see’ its history. In the same way, according toLodge, only certain persons can see the ‘tape recording’ known as a ghost.Half a century after Lodge, T.C. Lethbridge—who was Keeper of Anglo-SaxonAntiquities at Cambridge—stumbled on the ‘psychometric’ theory as a result ofhis own observations. When he saw the ‘ghost’ of the man in a hunting kit, hewas at first inclined to wonder whether it had been purely a mental picture,perhaps ‘picked up’ from somebody else’s mind. Perhaps the huntsman had been aformer occupant of the rooms, and was sitting in his armchair at home sipping awhisky as he thought about the good old days at Cambridge; and perhaps somehowthe image had got itself transferred into Lethbridge’s mind . . .He was also intrigued by a much later experience. A woman who lived close to hishome in Devon—reputed to be a witch—had died under mysterious circumstancessuggesting murder. Lethbridge and his wife had both noticed a curiously ‘nasty’feeling around her cottage just after her death. Moreover, he could step in andout of it, as if it ended quite sharply. Could this, he wondered, be some kindof field, analogous to a magnetic field? He was an excellent dowser—or waterdiviner—and his experience led him to speculate that certain places can ‘record’strong emotions, and that people who can dowse are more likely to ‘pick up’these recordings than people who can’t. In other words, a dowser is more likelyto see a ghost than most people.Lethbridge developed his theory about ghosts in a number of books written in thelast ten years of his life (he died in 1972).1 It is a natural and logicalextension of Buchanan’s ‘psychometry’ and of Lodge’s theory about ‘recordings’.But Lethbridge has also placed it on a more scientific basis by suggesting thatwhat does the ‘recording’ is some kind of magnetic field associated with water.The principle sounds very much like that of a tape recorder, where a magneticfield ‘imprints’ the sounds on an iron-oxide tape. In Lethbridge’s theory, themagnetic field of water records emotions and prints them on its surroundings—inthe case of the ‘old witch’, on the walls of her damp cottage.All this helps to explain why Lombroso’s theory about haunted houses struck manycontemporary researchers as ‘unscientific’. The ‘psychometric hypothesis’ seemsto explain the majority of hauntings. For example, the ghost of the young man inthe Place du Lion d’Or gave no sign of being aware of the presence of thevarious people who saw him, and that is what you would expect if a ghost is somekind of ‘film’ or recording of a long-past event.As to the poltergeist, the ‘mischievous spirit’ theory found little acceptanceamong investigators even in the earliest days of psychical research. The reasonwas simply that a scientific investigator prefers natural explanations. Andwhere poltergeists were concerned, there were a number of plausible ones.Eusapia Palladino could cause tables to rise into the air. The famous Victorianmedium Daniel Dunglas Home frequently caused heavy objects of furniture to floatright up to the ceiling, while he himself floated out of third-storey windowsand came back by the window on the other side of the room. Home and Palladinoclaimed that their powers came from spirits; but they might have been deceivingthemselves. One of the first thing that struck the early scientificinvestigators of poltergeists is that there usually seemed to be a disturbedadolescent in the house—usually a girl. Lombroso himself had noticed how oftenteenage girls seemed to be involved in his paranormal cases—like the girl whocould see with her ear. And his original ‘nervous force’ theory struck mostinvestigators as far more plausible than his later belief in mischievousspirits.This younger generation of investigators had another reason for dismissing thespirit theory. By 1909, Freud had made most psychologists aware that theunconscious mind is a far more powerful force than Lombroso had recognised.Lombroso has a section on the unconscious in After Death—What? and it revealsthat he thought of it as little more than another name for absent-mindedness orpoetic inspiration. Freud had made people aware that the unconscious is a kindof ocean, full of dangerous currents and strange monsters. Moreover, Freudemphasised that the most powerful of these unconscious forces is the sex drive.Could it be coincidence that most poltergeist cases involve adolescents at theage of puberty?This, of course, still fails to explain how the unconscious mind of a disturbedadolescent can make bottles fly through the air. But again, science had someplausible theories. In Basle, a university student named Carl Jung was intriguedby a female cousin who began to go into trances at the age of puberty, and spokewith strange voices. And at about the time this started, the dining-room tablesuddenly split apart with a loud report. There was also a sudden explosion froma sideboard, and when they looked inside, they found that a bread knife hadshattered into several pieces. Jung suspected that his cousin’s ‘illness’ wasresponsible for these events, and he coined the term ‘exteriorisationphenomenon’ to explain them—meaning more-or-less what Lombroso meant by ‘nerveforce’. Jung had no doubt that it was caused by the unconscious mind, and apersonal experience confirmed him in this view. One day he was arguing withFreud about ‘exteriorisation’ and Freud was highly sceptical. Jung’s risingirritation caused a burning sensation in his chest ‘as if my diaphragm wasbecoming red hot!’ Suddenly, there was a loud explosion in the bookcase.‘There,’ said Jung, ’that was an exteriorisation phenomenon.’ ‘Bosh,’ saidFreud, to which Jung replied: ‘It is not bosh, and to prove it, there will beanother explosion in a moment.’ And a second explosion occurred. Jung had nodoubt that he had somehow caused the explosions by getting angry.Most modern investigators of poltergeist phenomena would agree with Jung. One ofthe rare exceptions was the late Harry Price, who wrote in Poltergeist OverEngland: ‘My own view is that they are invisible, intangible, malicious andnoisy entities . . .’ He adds: ‘Poltergeists are able, by laws yet unknown toour physicists, to extract energy from living persons, often from the young, andusually from girl adolescents, especially if they suffer from some mentaldisorder.’ Unfortunately, Price’s reputation has declined steadily since hisdeath in 1948, with accusations of lying, cheating, publicity-seeking and fraud;so most psychical researchers would dismiss his views on poltergeists as adeliberate attempt at sensationalism. Besides, Price himself admitted thatpoltergeists seem to be connected with sexual energies; and he described how thehusband of the Austrian medium Frieda Weisl told him that, during their earlymarried life, ornaments jumped off the mantelshelf when she had a sexual orgasm.This certainly sounds like Jung’s ‘exteriorisation phenomenon’.We may say, then, that the modern consensus of opinion is that a poltergeist isa person, not a spirit. The view is summed up by Richard Cavendish1:‘Because poltergeist incidents usually occur in close proximity to a livingperson, parapsychologists tend to regard them as instances of psychokinesis orPK. Since poltergeist incidents are recurrent and arise unexpectedly andspontaneously, they are commonly referred to as instances of ‘recurrentspontaneous psychokinesis’ or RSPK. They appear to be unconscious cases of PKsince the person who seems to bring them about is usually unaware of hisinvolvement. Some persons remain convinced that RSPK phenomena are due to theagency of an incorporeal entity, such as the spirit of a deceased person or a‘demon’ which has attached itself to some living person and which causes theincidents by PK. However, since there is no evidence for such spirits apart fromthe phenomena themselves, most parapsychologists are of the opinion thatpoltergeist phenomena are examples of unconscious PK exercised by the personaround whom they occur.’‘Psychokinesis’ means, of course, ‘mind over matter’. And it has been widelyaccepted by investigators since the mid-1930s, when Dr J.B. Rhine, of DukeUniversity, conducted a series of experiments with a gambler who claimed that hecould influence the fall of the dice by concentrating on them. Rhine’sexperiments showed that the gambler was correct; he could, to some extent,influence the dice to make it turn up sixes. Since then, there have beenthousands of similar experiments, and the evidence for PK is regarded asoverwhelming.Yet it has to be admitted that even its ‘star performers’—Nina Kulagina, FeliciaParise, Ingo Swann, Uri Geller—cannot make objects fly around the room aspoltergeists seem to be able to. The Russian Kulagina first came to theattention of scientists when she was in hospital after a nervous breakdown; herdoctors were fascinated to see that she could reach into her sewing basket andtake out any colour of thread she wanted without looking at it. They tested herand found that she could, beyond all doubt, ‘see’ colours with her fingertips.Her healing powers were also remarkable—for example, she could make wounds healup in a very short time simply by holding her hand above them. But it was whenthey tested her for PK that they discovered her outstanding abilities. She couldsit at a table, stare at a small object—like a matchbox or a wineglass—and makeit move without touching it. She told investigators that when her concentration‘worked’, she felt a sharp pain in her spine, and her eyesight blurred. Herblood pressure would rise abruptly.Nina Kulagina’s most spectacular feat was to make an apple fall off a table.Ingo Swann, an American, is able to deflect compass needles by PK. FeliciaParise, who was inspired to try ‘mind over matter’ after seeing a film aboutKulagina, can move small objects like matchsticks and pieces of paper. UriGeller, the world’s best-known ‘psychic’, can bend spoons by gently rubbing themwith his finger, and snap metal rings by simply holding his hand above them.Now Geller has, in fact, produced certain ‘poltergeist effects’. In 1976, Ispent some time with Geller in Barcelona, interviewing him for a book Isubsequently wrote about him. A number of objects fell out of the air when I waswith him, and these seemed to be typical examples of ‘teleportation’. Anotherfriend, Jesse Lasky, has described to me how, when Uri was having dinner attheir flat, there was a pinging noise like a bullet, and a silver button flewacross the kitchen; it had come out of the bedroom drawer of Jesse’s wife, Pat.Geller was standing by the refrigerator with a bottle of milk in one hand and atin of Coca Cola in the other when it happened. Another odd feature of thisincident is that the button—if it came from the bedroom drawer—must have somehowtravelled through three walls to reach the kitchen. ‘Interpenetration of matter’is another curious feature in many poltergeist cases.But then, Geller was not trying to make this happen. As I discovered whengetting to know him, odd events seem to happen when he is around. On the morningI went to meet him, at an office in the West End of London, he asked me, ‘Do youhave any connection with Spain?’ I said that I didn’t. A moment before I walkedinto the office, a Spanish coin had risen out of the ashtray on the desk, andfloated across to the other side of the room, where Geller and a publicrelations officer were standing. I subsequently came to know the P.R.O wellenough to accept her word that this really took place. When Geller left theLaskys’ flat in central London, he buzzed them from the intercom at the frontdoor and explained with embarrassment that he had damaged the door. Awrought-iron dragon which decorated the centre of the door had beentwisted—fortunately they were able to force it back without breaking it. Gellerexplained that he is never sure when such things will happen, or even whetherthe razor with which he shaves is likely to buckle in his hand.In short, it seems that even the most talented practitioners of psychokinesiscannot produce real ‘poltergeist effect’ at will. But then, of course, wealready know that there is another interesting possibility: that the effects maybe produced by ‘Stan’, that person in the other side of the brain. If there isanother person living in the right hemisphere of your brain, is it not possiblethat he is the one who is responsible for ‘spontaneous psychokinesis’?But even if we are willing to entertain this hypothesis, it still leaves us withthe question: how does the right brain do it? In fact, is there any evidencewhatsoever that the right brain possesses paranormal powers?And the answer to this is a qualified yes. We can begin with one of the simplestand best authenticated of all ‘paranormal powers’, water divining. The waterdiviner, or dowser, holds a forked hazel twig (or even a forked rod made fromtwo strips out of a whalebone corset, tied at the end) in both hands, so thereis a certain tension—a certain ‘springiness’—on the rod. And when he walks overan underground stream or spring, the rod twists either upwards or downwards intheir hands.In fact, dowsers can dowse for almost anything, from oil and minerals to a coinhidden under the carpet. It seems that they merely have to decide what they’relooking for, and the unconscious mind—or the ‘other self’—does the rest.I have described elsewhere1 how I discovered, to my own astonishment, that Icould dowse. I was visiting a circle of standing stones called the MerryMaidens, in Cornwall—a circle that probably dates back to the same period asStonehenge. When I held the rod—made of two strips of plastic tied at the end—soas to give it a certain tension, it responded powerfully when I approached thestones. It would twist upwards as I came close to the stone, and then dip againas I stepped back or walked past it. What surprised me was that I feltnothing—no tingling in the hands, no sense of expectancy. It seemed to happen asautomatically as the response of a voltmeter in an electric circuit. Since thenI have shown dozens of people how to dowse. It is my own experience that nineout of ten people can dowse, and that all young children can do it. Some adultshave to ‘tune in’—to learn to allow the mind and muscles to relax—but this canusually be done in a few minutes.Scientific tests have shown that what happens in dowsing is that the musclesconvulse—or tighten—of their own accord. And if the dowser holds a pendulum—madeof a wooden bob on a short length of string—then the pendulum goes into acircular swing over standing stones or underground water—once again, throughsome unconscious action of the muscles.Another experiment performed by Roger Sperry throws an interesting light ondowsing. He tried flashing green or red lights at random into the ‘blind’ eye ofsplit-brain patients (into the left visual field, connected to the rightcerebral hemisphere). The patients were then asked what colour had just beenseen. Naturally, they had no idea, and the guesses showed a random score. But ifthey were allowed a second guess, they would always get it right. They mightsay: ‘Red—oh no, green . . .’ The right side of the brain had overheard thewrong guess, and communicated by causing the patient’s muscles to twitch. It wasthe equivalent of a kick under the table.Unable to communicate in any other way, the right brain did it by contractingthe muscles.It seems, therefore, a reasonable guess that this is also what happens indowsing. The right brain knows there is water down there, or some peculiarmagnetic force in the standing stones; it communicates this knowledge by causingthe muscles to tense, which makes the rod jerk upwards.Most ‘psychics’ observe that deliberate effort inhibits their powers. Onepsychic, Lois Bourne, has written:‘One of the greatest barriers to mediumship is the intellect, and the mostserious problem I had to learn in my early psychic career was the suspension ofmy intellect. If, during the practice of extrasensory perception, I allowedlogic to prevail, and permitted myself to rationalise the impressions Ireceived, and the things I said, I would be hopelessly lost within a conflict.It is necessary that I totally by-pass my conscious mind . . .’Similarly, Felicia Parise found that she was at first totally unable to cause‘PK effects’, no matter how hard she tried. But one day, when she had receivedan emotional shock—the news that her grandmother was dying—she reached out for asmall plastic bottle and it moved away from her hand. From then on, she had the‘trick’ of causing PK.All this underlines something that should be quite clear in any case: that, in asense, we are all ‘split-brain patients’. The logical self interferes with thenatural operations of the right brain. This is why the artist has to wait for‘inspiration’—for the left brain to relax and allow the right to take over.Mozart was an example of an artist who was born with an unusual harmony betweenthe two halves of his brain, and he commented once that tunes were always‘walking into his head’—meaning into his left brain. In most of us, a certainself-mistrust, a tendency to ask questions, sits like a bad-tempered door-keeperbetween the two halves of the brain. When we become subject to increasingtension and worry, this has the effect of increasing the door-keeper’smistrustfulness. He thinks he is performing a useful service in keeping out theimpulses from the ‘other half. In fact, he is simply isolating the left-brainself and making it more tense and miserable. Nervous breakdown is due to theincreasingly desperate attempts of this door-keeper to cope with problems inwhat he considers to be the right way, and which is, in fact, the worst possibleway.What Lois Bourne has said about suspending the rational intellect seems to applyto most forms of ‘extra-sensory perception’ and paranormal abilities. Mostpeople have had the experience of reaching out to pick up the telephone andknowing who is on the other end. Everyone has had the experience of thinkingabout someone they haven’t heard from in years, and receiving a letter from themthe same day. ‘Extra-sensory perception’ (ESP) seems to operate when we arerelaxed, and thinking about something else.All this, then, seems to offer a basis for an explanation of the poltergeist. Itis true that human powers of psychokinesis seem rather feeble—it would be farmore convincing if we could point to some medium or psychic who could causeobjects to fly around the room at will. But then, perhaps the explanation isthat the ‘door-keeper’ inhibits the natural powers of the right brain. Even good‘mediums’ cannot put themselves into a ‘sensitive’ state at will; some of themneed to go into a trance; others need to be in the right frame of mind. Trancemediums who try to ‘work normally’ (i.e. when wide-awake) often find itexhausting and frustrating, because the ‘censor’ keeps getting in the way. So ifthe poltergeist is some peculiar power or force residing in the right brain,perhaps this explains why it cannot be called upon at will, even by giftedpsychics such as Uri Geller.Dowsing also provides us with a possible explanation of the origin of thatforce. In some dowsers, the presence of underground water produces such apowerful effect that they go into violent convulsions. One of the most famous ofFrench dowsers, Barthelemy Bléton, discovered his powers accidentally at the ageof 7; he was taking his father’s meal out to the fields when he sat down on acertain spot, and felt sick and faint. Digging at this spot revealed a powerfulunderground stream. Again, an old lady who is a member of the British Society ofDowsers described at a conference a few years ago how she could pick up a largebranch from the ground, and it would swing around in her hand like a pointeruntil it indicated water.If the dowsing rod is responding to some magnetic force, either in water orstanding stones, it seems possible that this same force, channelled through theright brain, could provide the energy for poltergeist effects.It looks, then, as if the modern psychical investigator is in a far betterposition than his predecessor of a century ago when it comes to constructingtheories about the paranormal. The recognition of the ‘two people’ inside ourheads may be the most important step ever taken in this direction.Having said this, it is necessary to admit that most of the mystery remainsunexplained. Lodge’s ‘psychometric hypothesis’ and Lethbridge’s theory of‘ghouls’ may provide an explanation for the majority of ghosts—but what aboutall those cases in which the witnesses insist that the ghost behaved as if itsaw them? Again, it would certainly be convenient if we could explain thepoltergeist in terms of ‘unconscious psychokinesis’. But why has no psychic beenable to duplicate poltergeist effects? It is not really an answer to say thatthey have not learned to switch the power on and off. Many psychics can switchother powers on and off—telepathy, psychokinesis, second sight. So why notpoltergeist effects?These awkward questions remind us that there are others we have failed toanswer. In the case of Lombroso’s bottle-smashing poltergeist in the Via Bava,why did it stop smashing bottles when the wife went away for the first time? IfLombroso is correct, and the poltergeist was a ‘spirit’ that drew its energyfrom people, then we have our explanation. The spirit needed energy from boththe wife and the young waiter to smash bottles and crockery. When the wife wentaway for the first time, it lost half its energy supply and decided to take arest. But the second time she went away, she cursed it, and it made a specialeffort to be disagreeable. In order to do this, it had to make use of the‘vestigial energy’ she had left on dishes and other objects she had touched.When the young waiter was eventually dismissed, the wife alone could not providesufficient energy for its needs and it went elsewhere . . .Modern psychical research has a way of ignoring such questions. It prefersstraightforward distinctions. If there is a ‘medium’ present (or, as we now say,a ‘focus’), then it is a poltergeist; if not, then it is a ghost.But even this pleasantly simple distinction proves to be less useful than itlooks. The ‘spirits’ themselves seem to dislike being type-cast, and oftendecline to stick to their proper role. A case that starts as an ordinaryhaunting may develop into a poltergeist haunting, and vice versa. And then, justto confuse the issue, the spirits occasionally identify themselves as devils anddemons, and manifest themselves in the highly disturbing form known as‘possession’. This subject is so complex that it deserves a chapter to itself. 1. Lethbridge’s theories will be further discussed in Chapter 14[../Text/19_chapter14.html].1.

The reason can be seen by anyone who reads Owen’s Footfalls on theBoundary of Another World and then turns to Lombroso’s After Death—What? Thebooks were published fifty years apart; yet they might both have been written atexactly the same time. Lombroso offers some ‘scientific evidence’, by way of afew experiments in telepathy; otherwise, he presents just the same kind ofevidence that Robert Dale Owen had presented. There was plenty of evidence forghosts, for poltergeists, for telepathy, for precognition, for ‘out of the bodyexperiences’, and a dozen other varieties of ‘paranormal’ experience. But theevidence seemed to lead nowhere. One remarkable case had even proved life afterdeath, to the satisfaction of most open-minded enquirers. This was thecelebrated ‘cross-correspondences’. By 1904, three of the chief founders of theSPR—Henry Sidgwick, Frederick Myers and Edmund Gurney— were dead, and it seemedlogical to hope that if they were still alive in another world, they would tryto communicate through mediums. In the previous year, a psychic named MrsHolland, the sister of Rudyard Kipling, began receiving written messages—through automatic writing—that seemed far more intelligent and thoughtful thanthe majority of such scripts. And in 1904, another psychic, Mrs Verrall—the wifeof a Cambridge don—also received some messages, one of which included the words‘Record the bits, and when fitted they will make the whole’.And it slowly became clear that the ‘senders’ claimed to be the spirits ofSidgwick, Myers and Gurney, and that what they were attempting was a ‘proof’ ofsuch complexity that there could be no possibility of fraud. In effect, theyseemed to be using a large number of mediums—others included Mrs Flemming, MrsForbes, and the famous American medium Mrs Piper—to produce a complex jigsawpuzzle or conundrum, giving each woman only part of the puzzle, so that therecould be no possible doubt that there was no collusion between them.Unfortunately, the conundrums were so complex that it would take a short bookeven to give a simple outline. A typical one is as follows:In 1906, Mrs Flemming produced a script containing the words Dawn, Evening andMorning, a reference to bay leaves, and the name Laurence. Six weeks later, MrsVerrall wrote out a message mentioning ‘laurel’ and a library. Mrs Piper cameout of a trance speaking of laurel, ‘nigger’, and a phrase that sounded like‘more head’. Mrs Flemming produced more scripts referring to Night and Day,Evening and Morning, and also a reference to Alexander’s tomb with laurelleaves. And eventually, all these clues pointed to the tomb of the Medicis inthe Church of San Lorenzo in Florence. It had been designed by Michelangelo, andcontained his sculpture of Night and Day, Evening and Morning. Lorenzo deMedici’s emblem was the laurel, and near the tombs is the Laurentian Library.Alexander (or Alessandro) de Medici was half negro; after his murder, his bodywas hidden in the tomb of Giuliano. ‘More head’ was actually ‘Moor head’—thehead of a negro. This conundrum was solved only four years after the first‘clue’, and there could be no question of telepathy between the mediums, sincethey did not understand what it was all about. Altogether, the case of thecross-correspondences is one of the most impressive—perhaps the mostimpressive—in the history of psychical research. It is true that the various‘clues’ are so complicated that few people have ever taken the trouble to studythe case. Yet the sheer complexity of the code at least indicates that itoriginated on a far higher level of intelligence than most spirit messages. Inaddition to which, it effectively disposes of the objection that spirits neverhave anything interesting to say.If the ‘spirits’ of Myers, Gurney and Sidgwick failed to convince the world ofthe reality of the afterlife, a far more skilful and flamboyant publicist wasnow preparing to launch himself into the project.Harry Price, ghost-hunter extraordinary, claimed that he was born in Shrewsbury,son of a wealthy paper manufacturer. A brilliant critical biography by TrevorHall, The Search for Harry Price, reveals that he was, in fact, the son of anunsuccessful grocer, and that he was born in London in 1881. From then until hewas about 40, he seems to have supported himself by a variety of jobs, includingcommercial travelling, manufacturing patent medicines, journalism and givinggramophone concerts. What is certain is that his lifelong interest in stagemagic began at the age of 8, when he saw an itinerant magician and patentmedicine salesman, the Great Sequah, giving a public performance. Price begancollecting books on magic, and became an expert magician. It may have been theinterest in magic that led him to join the Society for Psychical Research in1920—the SPR was then, as now, much concerned with trying to detect fraud inmediums. E.J. Dingwall, who was then Research Officer for the Society, askedPrice if he would care to come with him to Munich, to attend some seances of aremarkable German medium, Willi Schneider—one of two brothers. The man whoarranged the seances was the German investigator, Baron von Schrenk-Notzing, afriend of Lombroso’s, and the author of a sensationally successful book calledMaterialisation Phenomena, which had aroused wide-spread scepticism in Germanywhen it appeared in 1914. Schrenk-Notzing himself was something of a flamboyantpublicist, and Trevor Hall suggests that Harry Price took his example to heart,and decided that this was the way to achieve the fame he craved. (He admittedfrankly that he had always wanted to get his name in Who’s Who.)The Schneider brothers, Willi and Rudi, the most psychic members of a psychicfamily, were born at Braunau-am-Inn and, according to one friend of the family,the phenomena began after they had spent an evening playing with a ouija board.Willi had then—in 1916—reached the age of puberty and the family was disturbedby loud knocking noises. Then objects began moving around, and Willi saw a ghostin the sitting room. Neighbours became so alarmed about the racket that thefamily were on the point of vacating the flat. By means of the ouija board, theytried questioning the ‘spirit’, which identified itself as a girl named OlgaLindtner, who claimed to be a reincarnation of the notorious Lola Montez. In duecourse, Willi went into a trance, and Olga spoke through him. In spite of doubtslater raised by Harry Price—after he had quarrelled with the brothers—there canbe no doubt that the phenomena were genuine. The novelist Thomas Mann attendedone seance, and has recorded how, as he pressed Willi’s knees tightly betweenhis own, and two other people held his hands, a handkerchief floated into theair, a bell began to ring and then floated into the air, a music box played, andthe keys of a typewriter were struck. Mann was convinced that deception wasimpossible.Harry Price and E.J. Dingwall witnessed similar occurrences, and also saw awhite hand which materialised in front of them; they had no doubt whatever ofthe genuineness of the phenomena, and said as much at a lecture to the SPR. Butby way of keeping his options open, Price helped to edit and publish a bookcalled Revelations of a Spirit Medium, in which a fake medium described thetricks of the trade.In 1923, Price got into conversation with a young nurse on a train; her name wasStella Cranshawe. He was fascinated to hear that mild poltergeist phenomenaoccurred around her—a feeling like a breeze, movement of small objects, rappingnoises, and flashes of light. By this time, Price knew enough about psychicalresearch to realise that the girl was probably, without knowing it, a medium. Hepersuaded her to allow herself to be investigated. And at the first seance, aheavy table levitated and moved across the room on two legs, raps sounded,lights flashed, and the temperature in the room dropped considerably. (At latersittings it became very low indeed.) At another seance, the table hit HarryPrice under the chin, then three of its legs snapped off, the top broke into twopieces, then the whole table crumbled into matchwood. Stella herself found allthese phenomena rather boring and, after she married in 1928, refused to takeany part in further experiments. It is possible, in any case, that her powerswould have vanished with marriage; many investigators have noted that there is aconnection between sexual frustration and ‘poltergeist effects’, and that sucheffects cease when the ‘focus’ leads a normal sex life. (She may also have feltthat seances were bad for her health—they often leave the medium exhausted.)In 1926, Price came upon one of the most remarkable poltergeist cases of alltime. In February 1925, a 13-year-old Rumanian peasant girl called EleonoraZugun went to visit her grandmother at the village of Buhai, and on the wayfound some money by the roadside, which she spent on sweets. Her grandmother,who was 105 years old, and had a reputation as a witch, told Eleonora that themoney had been left by the devil, and that she would now be possessed by thedevil. The next day, stones rained down on the house, smashing windows, andsmall objects near Eleonora rose up in the air. Eleonora was quickly sent hometo Talpa, and the phenomena continued there. A jug full of water rose slowly inthe air and floated several feet. A trunk rocked up and down, A porridge bowlhit a visitor on the head and made a nasty wound. Eleonora was sent to a nearbymonastery, then shut in a lunatic asylum. A psychical researcher managed to gether removed and taken back to the monastery. There he witnessed all kinds ofthings flying through the air. The ‘spirit’ also began slapping the girl. Then acountess with an interest in psychical research—Zoë Wassilko-Serecki—heard aboutEleonora, went to see her, and brought her back with her to Vienna. Eleonora wasdelighted with her new life in the countess’s flat, and began training as ahairdresser. And the poltergeist phenomena continued—indicating, perhaps, that apoltergeist does not need a psychologically ‘disturbed’ teenager for itsmanifestations. The countess observed what most other researchers intopoltergeist activity have noted: that the poltergeist seems to dislike anyoneactually seeing it move objects; the countess noted that various small itemswould fall from the air without being seen to move from their original place.The poltergeist—or dracu (demon), as Eleonora called it—communicated byautomatic writing, and even spoke a few sentences in a ‘breathy and tonelessvoice’. But what it had to say indicated that its level of intelligence wasextremely low.The dracu also punched and slapped Eleonora, threw her out of bed, pulled herhair, filled her shoes with water (the poltergeist seems to be able to createwater, as we shall see), and stole her favourite possessions. In March 1926, itbegan scratching and biting her, as well as sticking needles into her. The bitemarks were often damp with saliva.Price came to Vienna at the end of April 1926, and was soon convinced that thiswas a genuine poltergeist. He took her back to London, where she was subjectedto laboratory tests. The movement of objects was less violent than in Vienna,but the bites and scratches continued to appear. One day, when she was tying upa parcel in front of several witnesses, she gave a gasp, and teeth marksappeared on her wrist, then scratches appeared on her forearm, cheeks andforehead.Back in Vienna, the movement of objects-ceased, but the scratches and bitescontinued, now often accompanied by quantities of an unpleasant spittle.Subjected to chemical analysis, this was found to be swarming withmicro-organisms (whereas Eleonora’s own saliva was relatively free from them).When she went to Berlin to be studied by Schrenk-Notzing, a researcher namedHans Rosenbusch accused her of cheating—with the cooperation of the countess;but this seems to be typical of the extreme scepticism of certain investigators.Finally, in 1927, the ‘spirit’ got tired of tormenting her, and went away. Shemoved to Czernowitz, in Rumania, and ran a successful hairdressing business.The countess was convinced that Eleonora herself—or rather, her unconsciousmind—was responsible for the attacks: she believed that Eleonora had powerfullydeveloped sexual urges, and that these were fixated on her father (it sounds asif she had been impressed by Freud); so the ‘attacks’ were a form ofself-punishment. Harry Price was inclined to agree, likening the bites to the‘stigmata’ that appear on the hands of saints and religious fanatics. Yet as weread the account of Eleanor’s sufferings at the hands of the dracu (there is anexcellent account in Alan Gauld’s Poltergeists), these explanations seem moreand more preposterous. A girl does not go on scratching and biting herself fortwo years because she feels guilty about her sexual desires, particularly if shefinds herself transformed, like Cinderella, into the protégée of a wealthycountess. Then what exactly happened?Clearly, the grandmother was in some way responsible for ‘triggering’ theattacks. Eleonora had reached the age—13—at which such things happen; she wasnot particularly happy in her present surroundings in Talpa, so there was anunderlying sense of frustration. Peasants are superstitious, and when hergrandmother told her that from now on she would belong to the devil and neverget rid of him, the effect must have been traumatic. Eleanora’s energies beganto ‘leak’. And some delinquent entity saw its chance, and made use of them. Itmay or may not be relevant that her grandmother had a reputation as a witch. Ifmagic—and presumably witchcraft—makes use of ‘spirits’, as Guy Playfairsuggests, then her grandmother’s house may have been the worst possible placefor a frustrated adolescent like Eleonora. (This matter of witchcraft is asubject to which we shall return in Chapter 10 [../Text/15_chapter10.html].)As to Harry Price, he continued his triumphant career as the chief PublicRelations Officer of the spirit world. He investigated fire-walking and theIndian rope trick, organised seances, was photographed in ‘haunted beds’ (with‘Professor’ Joad), and staged an experiment on the summit of the Brocken to tryto change a goat into a young man. (This was a failure.) Price loved publicity,and lost no opportunity to be photographed by journalists. He was delighted thatso many correspondents seemed to think that his name was Sir Harry Price. Yet healso made the general public conscious of psychical research in a way it hadnever been before. Because Price emphasised that he was a sceptic and ascientist, not a Spiritualist, people took him more seriously than they did a‘believer’ like Conan Doyle or Sir Oliver Lodge. When he announced in 1933 thathe now felt that Rudi Schneider might be a fake, and produced a photograph thatseemed to show him cheating during a seance, people felt that he was showingunflinching honesty. (In fact, the photograph was later shown to be a fake;Price’s motive was almost certainly a desire to get his own back on Rudi for, ashe saw it, ‘deserting’ him for another investigator, Lord Charles Hope, whosefindings Price denounced.)Yet in spite of his craving for publicity and his desire to get into Who’s Who,Price did much important and valuable work during these years. In a sense, hismotivation is irrelevant; he was a genuine enthusiast for psychical research.The majority of his investigations were not spectacular: just the plodding,day-to-day work of a patient researcher, sitting with mediums, psychometrists,healers, miracle workers. And, if anything, Price was inclined to beover-critical. In Norway, he visited the home of Judge Ludwig Dahl, and had asitting with the judge’s daughter Ingeborg, whose ‘controls’ were her two deadbrothers. While not regarding her as a downright fake, Price was unimpressed.Yet one of the dead brothers prophesied that their father would die on August 8,1934, seven years later, and this was precisely the day on which he did die froma stroke during a swim.A case which certainly deserves mention in any account of Price’s career is thecurious affair of the talking mongoose of Cashen’s Gap. It was far from beingone of Price’s successes; yet it remains an intriguing mystery.In 1932, Price heard about a farmer called Irving, at Cashen’s Gap on the Isleof Man, who had made friends with a mongoose that could speak several languages.It could also read minds and sing hymns. Price could not find time to go to theIsle of Man, but a friend of his, a Captain M.H. Macdonald, offered to go.It seemed that the Irving family—who (significantly) had a 13-year-old daughternamed Voirrey—had been disturbed by noises from behind the panels of the house:barking, spitting and blowing noises. The farmer lay in wait with a gun, withoutsuccess, and tried putting down poison; the creature eluded him. So the farmertried communicating with it, making various animal noises; to his astonishment,it seemed to be able to imitate them. Voirrey tried nursery rhymes, and it beganto repeat these. Finally, it showed itself—a small, bushy-tailed creature thatclaimed to be a mongoose. They called it Gef. And Gef told them he was fromIndia. Mr Irving seldom saw Gef, except in glimpses, as he ran along a beam, butVoirrey and Mrs Irving often saw him face to face.Macdonald arrived at the farm on February 26, 1932, and saw nothing. When heleft to go to his hotel a shrill voice screamed: ‘Go away! Who is that man?’ Thefarmer said this was Gef. The next day, as Macdonald was having tea with theIrvings, a large needle bounced off the teapot; and Irving remarked that Gef wasalways throwing things. Later, he heard the shrill voice upstairs talking withVoirrey and Mrs Irving; when he called to ask if the mongoose would come down,the voice screamed: ‘No, I don’t like you.’ He tried sneaking upstairs, but themongoose heard a stair creak, and shrieked: ‘He’s coming!’ And from then on,Macdonald saw and heard no more of Gef.According to Irving, who kept a diary, Gef talked in a language he claimed to beRussian, sang in Spanish and recited a poem in Welsh. He killed rabbits forthem—by strangling them—and left them outside. He claimed to have made visits tothe nearest town, and told the Irvings what various people had been doing;Irving checked and found he was correct. He was able to tell Irving what washappening ten miles away without leaving the farm. And when he was asked if hewas a spirit, Gef replied: ‘I am an earth-bound spirit.’In March 1935, Gef told Irving that he had plucked some hairs from his tail andleft them on the mantelpiece; these were forwarded to Price, who had themexamined. They proved to be dog hairs—probably from the collie dog on the farm.When Harry Price was mentioned, Gef said he didn’t like him because he ‘had hisdoubting cap on’. And when Price finally visited Cashen’s Gap, the visit was awaste of time. Gef only came back to the farm after Price had left. And this,virtually, was the end of the story—although Macdonald paid a second visit tothe farm and again heard the mongoose talking in its shrill voice.It is possible, of course, that the Irvings were hoaxers. But they struck theinvestigators as honest. And it is difficult to see why, if they wantedattention, they should invent anything as bizarre as a talking mongoose. Whyshould Irving have invited Price to stay if he was simply a hoaxer?What seems rather more probable is that Gef was a poltergeist— an ‘earth-boundspirit’, as he himself claimed. Voirrey was a lonely girl who had just reachedpuberty. The disturbances started like most poltergeist disturbances, withnoises in the woodwork, scratchings and other sounds. Later small objects flewthrough the air, and Gef was assumed to have ‘thrown’ them. But he also seemedto be able to cause ‘action at a distance’: when a saucepan of water turned overon the stove and soaked Irving’s shoes, he assumed this was Gef. Theclairvoyance also sounds like a poltergeist, and the knowledge of other people’saffairs. And it seems odd that the rabbits were strangled—not a mongoose’snormal method of killing. In fact, the Gef case seems to belong on theborderland between the straightforward poltergeist and the elemental orhobgoblin. (In the mid-19th century, as Robert Dale Owen points out, the wordpoltergeist was usually translated hobgoblin.)Trevor Hall is of the opinion that the poltergeist case which Price claimed tobe his first experience of ‘ghost hunting’ was pure invention, and he could beright—Price says that it took place when he was 15 at a village which he callsParton Magna; but since the rest of the details concern his wealthy relativesand his return to a public school, we are probably safe in assuming it nevertook place. But with Price, one can never be sure. In Confessions of a GhostHunter (1936), he has a chapter called ‘The Strange Exploits of a LondonPoltergeist’, in which he states that he is forced to disguise the names and thelocation because it occurred so recently. But the case which he goes on todescribe is thoroughly well authenticated, and is, in fact, one of the mostremarkable of this century.It actually took place in No. 8 Eland Road, Battersea, and began on November 29,1927, when lumps of coal, chunks of washing soda, and copper coins began to raindown on the conservatory roof. The house was occupied by an 86-year-old invalid,Henry Robinson, his son Frederick (27), his three daughters, and a grandson of14, Peter. When some of the falling objects smashed the glass, they sent for thepolice. As the constable stood in the back-garden, a lump of coal knocked offhis helmet. He rushed to the garden wall and pulled himself up—but there was noone around.The Robinsons’ washerwoman was terrified when she went into the wash-house andfound the place full of smoke, and a pile of red-hot cinders on the floor; shegave notice.Then the poltergeist began to get into its stride—and it was an exceptionallydestructive spirit. Ornaments smashed against walls, articles of furnitureoverturned, windows were broken. When they moved the old man out of his bedroom,a huge chest of drawers toppled over; a few minutes later the hall stand beganto move, and broke in two when Frederick tried to hold it.In January, an out-of-work journalist named Jane Cunningham was passing thehouse when she heard an almighty crash. A young man in shirtsleeves ran out.Jane grabbed her notebook and went in to investigate. This time, the poltergeisthad smashed the whole conservatory just as if it had placed a bomb in it—allover the garden there was glass, lumps of coal and washing soda—and pennies. Herreport on the occurrence led to widespread press interest in the case.Price went to see the house, and the poltergeist threw a gas-lighter past him;otherwise, nothing much happened. Soon afterwards, Frederick had a mentalbreakdown and had to be sent into hospital. Chairs marched down the hallway insingle file. When Mrs Perkins—the mother of the boy Peter—tried to lay thetable, chairs kept scattering all the crockery.Price assumed that Peter was the ‘focus’ and suggested he should be sent away;he went to stay with relatives in the country. But the poltergeist remained.Objects continued to be thrown around. The old man had to be removed tohospital, and one of the daughters fell ill. The police could only advise thefamily to vacate the house for the time being, which they did, staying withfriends.A medium held a seance in the house, and began to shiver. But she wasunsuccessful in identifying the ‘spirit’. Price paid another visit, with anewspaperman, and more objects were thrown—although not when anyone waswatching. Finally, Frederick Robinson came home from the mental home where hehad been confined, and quickly moved the whole family elsewhere. This wasvirtually the end of the story.Yet there was a postscript. Price had heard that small slips of paper withwriting on them had fluttered from the air. Frederick, sick of the wholebusiness, declined to comment. But many years later, in 1941, he broke silencein the Spiritualist newspaper Two Worlds, stating that slips of paper had fallenfrom the air, and that some of them contained writing made by tiny pinholes.(The Seeress of Prevorst also produced sheets of paper with geometrical drawingsmade by the same method.) One of these messages read: ‘I am having a bad timehere. I cannot rest. I was born during the reign of William the Conqueror.’ Itwas signed ‘Tom Blood’. Other messages were signed ‘Jessie Blood’.The Battersea poltergeist seems to be in every way typical of the species.Whether or not it was genuinely an earthbound spirit from the days of Williamthe Conqueror must remain in doubt; poltergeists are not necessarily truthful.(But, as the Rocha case (see p. 282 [../Text/14_chapter09.html#page_282]) shows,the dead have no sense of passing time.) The chief mystery of the case is whereit obtained the energy to continue the ‘haunting’ after the boy Peter left—forit seems reasonable to assume he was the ‘focus’. The answer may be provided byPrice’s observation that at the back of the house there was a mental home. Priceactually suggested that some ex-servicemen patients in this home might havethrown lumps of coal (but this is probably an example of his desire to beregarded as a hard-headed sceptic). The mentally disturbed are often the‘focuses’ of poltergeist activity, so it seems possible that the ‘spirit’ founda convenient reservoir of surplus energy just over the garden wall.The case with which Price’s name has become most widely associated is, ofcourse, that of Borley Rectory. And in spite of the ‘debunking’ that has takenplace since Price’s death in 1948, it remains one of the most interestinghauntings of the 20th century. After Price’s death, a whole volume of theProceedings of the Society for Psychical Research was devoted to The Haunting ofBorley Rectory, ‘A Critical Survey of the Evidence’, by Dingwall, Trevor Halland Kate Goldney. They allege that Price probably produced some of the‘poltergeist’ phenomena himself by tossing pebbles—which, from our knowledge ofPrice, must be admitted as possible. Their overall conclusion is that there areso many doubts that it would probably be simplest to regard the haunting ofBorley as a fairy story. But this is to ignore the fact that stories ofhauntings were common long before Price came on the scene, and have continuedsince he left it. Anyone who feels that the SPR survey proves that Price was aliar should read the long account of Borley in Peter Underwood’s Gazetteer ofBritish Ghosts, with Underwood’s own first-hand reports from interviews withwitnesses.Borley Rectory was built in 1863 on the site of Borley Manor House, which inturn seems to have been built on the site of a Benedictine abbey. It was builtby the Reverend H.D.E. Bull. It is difficult to pin down the earliest known‘sightings’, but it is clear that, during Henry Bull’s tenancy, a number ofpeople saw the apparition of a nun. Henry Bull himself knew of the legend that anun and a Benedictine monk had tried to elope, been caught, and had both beenkilled, the nun being bricked up alive. Bull’s daughter Ethel confirmed in aletter to Trevor Hall in 1953 that she had awakened to find a strange manstanding beside her bed, and had felt someone sitting down on the bed on severaloccasions; she also told Peter Underwood how, on July 28, 1900, she and her twosisters all saw a nun-like figure gliding along ‘Nun’s Walk’, apparently tellingher beads. The other sister, Elsie, saw the nun, who looked quite solid, andwent to ask her what she wanted; the nun vanished.After the Reverend Henry Bull’s death, his son, the Reverend Harry Bull, tookover the rectory. He was interested in psychical research, and claimed that hesaw many ghosts. His daughter told Price that he had seen a legendary phantomcoach (in which the lovers were supposed to have fled) and that, one day in thegarden, the retriever had howled with terror, looking towards some legs visibleunder a fruit tree. Bull, thinking this was a poacher, followed the legs as theywalked towards a postern gate; at which point he realised that the ‘poacher’ wassomehow incomplete. The legs disappeared through the gate without opening it.Harry Bull died in 1927, and the rectory was empty until 1928, when the ReverendGuy Smith and his wife moved in. One stormy night, there was a furious ringingof the doorbell; when Smith arrived there, he found no one. It happened againlater—a peal so prolonged that Smith was able to get to the door before itstopped; again, there was no one. After that, all the keys of all the rooms fellout of the locks overnight; later, they vanished. Then they began hearingslippered footsteps. Stones were thrown—small pebbles. Lights were switched on.One day, Mrs Smith thought she saw a horse-drawn coach in the drive. Mr Smiththought he heard someone whisper, ‘Don’t, Carlos, don’t’, as he was walking intothe chapel. The Smiths decided to contact the Daily Mirror, who asked HarryPrice if he would be willing to go along with an investigator. They told Pricetheir story, and gave him every facility to investigate. But within nine months,they had had enough of the place—perhaps because its plumbing left much to bedesired—and moved to Norfolk. According to the SPR report, the Smiths onlycalled the Daily Mirror because they were concerned about all the stories thatthe house was haunted, and wanted to reassure their parishioners by getting theplace a clean bill of health. This story sounds, on the face of it, absurd.Moreover, there exists a letter from Mr Smith to Harry Price stating: ‘Borley isundoubtedly haunted.’ (It is true that Mrs Smith wrote a letter to the ChurchTimes in 1929 saying she did not believe the house to be haunted, but this seemsto have been a belated attempt to stem the flood of sensational publicity thatfollowed the Daily Mirror story.)In October 1930, the rectory was taken over by the Reverend L.A. Foyster, andhis much younger wife Marianne. Foyster, oddly enough, had lived near Amherst atthe time of the Esther Cox case, and the SPR survey makes much of thiscoincidence; however, it seems doubtful that the vicar would attempt to fakedisturbances on the model of his earlier experience. Certainly, the Foysterincumbency saw the most spectacular exhibitions of the Borley poltergeist.Foyster kept a diary of the disturbances. Bells were rung, bricks thrown,footsteps heard and water out of a jug poured over the couple when in bed.Foyster was even awakened by a violent blow on the head from his own hairbrush.They saw a number of apparitions, including the nun and a clergyman who wasidentified as the Reverend Henry Bull, the builder of the rectory. Writingappeared on the walls, asking for a mass to be said, and asking for ‘Light’.There is much independent confirmation of all these events. A Justice of thePeace named Guy L’Estrange visited Borley at the invitation of the Foysters, andwrote a lengthy account of it. As soon as he arrived, he saw a dim figure nearthe porch, which vanished as soon as he approached. Mrs Foyster had a bruise onher forehead—something ‘like a man’s fist’ had struck her the previous evening.The Foysters were telling L’Estrange about mysterious fires that kept breakingout in locked rooms when there was a loud crash in the hall they found itlittered with broken crockery. Then bottles began flying about. L’Estrange notesthat they seemed to appear suddenly in mid-air. The bottles were coming from alocked storage shed outside. All the bells began to ring, making a deafeningclamour—but all the bell wires had been cut. L’Estrange shouted: ‘If someinvisible person is present, please stop ringing for a moment.’ Instantly, thebells stopped—stopped dead, as if each clapper had been grabbed by an unseenhand. Later, sitting alone in front of the fire, L’Estrange heard footstepsbehind him; he turned, but the room was empty. The footsteps had come from apart of the wall where there had once been a door. In bed, L’Estrange felt theroom become icy cold, and saw a kind of shape materialising from a patch ofluminosity; he walked towards it, and had a feeling of something trying to pushhim back. He spoke to it, and it slowly vanished. He was luckier than anothervisitor who thought that the ghostly figure was someone playing a joke, andtried to grab it; he was given a hard blow in the eye.The rector and others tried praying in the chapel, taking with them a relic ofthe Curé of Ars, and then went around the house making signs of the cross.Finally, they all spent the night in the Blue Room, where Henry Bull (andothers) had died; they asked that the entity should stop troubling the inmatesof the house; a black shadow began to form against the wall, then dissolved. Butafter this, temporary peace descended on Borley Rectory.In 1935, the Foysters decided they had had enough, and moved. Price rented therectory in 1937, and arranged for a team of investigators to go in. But themajor phenomena were over. Even so, the chief investigator, Sidney Glanville, aretired engineer, became completely convinced of the reality of the haunting.In March 1938, the team were experimenting with a planchette, which wrote themessage that Borley would be destroyed by fire. This happened in February 1939,when the house mysteriously burned down. Yet the phenomena continued; aCambridge team investigating the ruins heard footsteps, saw patches of light,and recorded sudden sharp drops in temperature.In August 1943, Price decided to try digging in the cellars at Borley—which hehad been advised to do by a planchette message which claimed to come from‘Glanvil’—the same Glanvil who wrote the account of the Tedworth drummer. Theyfound a cream jug, which had also been referred to by the planchette, and somefragments of a human skull. The jawbone showed signs of a deep-seatedabscess—Peter Underwood speculates that this is why the phantom nun alwayslooked miserable.The SPR survey on Borley, which appeared eight years after Price’s death, hadthe effect of seriously undermining his credit. Trevor Hall’s Search for HarryPrice (1978) completed the work of destroying his reputation. yet although thisleaves no doubt that Price lied about his origins—perhaps romanced would be abetter word—and hungered for fame, it produces no evidence that Price was notexactly what he always claimed to be: an enthusiastic scientific investigator ofparanormal phenomena. To assume that, because Price wanted to be thought a‘gentleman’, he was also dishonest as a paranormal researcher, is surely poorpsychology. Price was one of those ambitious men who crave an outlet for theirenergies. He was 40 years old before he found the opportunity he was lookingfor—a long time for a man of Price’s impatient temperament. It came whenDingwall invited him to Munich to study the Schneider brothers. From then on,Price had discovered his vocation; at last, he had found the outlet he neededfor his explosive energy and romanticism. And when a man as energetic andromantic as Harry Price finally finds what he is looking for, he does not riskspoiling everything with a little cheap skulduggery. It only takes one scandalto destroy a scientist’s reputation. But to put it this way is to imply thatPrice disciplined his natural dishonesty solely to maintain his reputation, andthis is to miss the real point: that once a man has found his vocation, he poursinto it all that is best about himself. Bernard Shaw has left an interestingdescription of the socialist Edward Aveling, who was Eleanor Marx’s common-lawhusband; he was an inveterate seducer, and a borrower who never paid his debts,yet where socialism was concerned, he was fiercely sincere. Everything we knowabout Price reveals that, where psychical research was concerned, he was totallydedicated—although not above grabbing publicity wherever he could find it.In short, it would be of no advantage to him to pretend the Borley phenomenawere genuine when they were not. His reputation was based on his scepticism asmuch as on his support of the reality of psychic phenomena. Possibly—like mostof us—he was capable of stretching a fact when it appealed to his romanticism.But in the case of Borley, there was no need to stretch facts. The haunting ofBorley does not rest on Price’s evidence alone; there are dozens of otherwitnesses, such as Guy L’Estrange—or Dom Richard Whitehouse, cited by Underwood,who witnessed just as many incredible occurrences: flying objects, ringing ofbells, writing on walls, outbreaks of fire, materialisation of bottles.And is there evidence that Price did stretch the facts? The SPR survey cites asan example of his dishonesty the episode of the pair of legs that Harry Bull sawwalking through the postern gate. Price says, admittedly, that when the manenerged from behind the fruit trees, he was headless. But the report then goeson to cite Price’s original notes, which read: ‘Rev. Harry Bull saw coach,Juvenal, retriever, terrified and growled. Saw man’s legs rest hid by fruittrees, thought poacher, followed with Juvenal, gate shut, but saw legs disappearthrough gate.’ Clearly, what Bull saw disappearing through the gate was not acomplete man, or Price would not refer only to the legs. It sounds as if theupper half of his body was missing—in which case, headless is a fairdescription.What seems clear from all accounts of the case is that the ‘ground’ itself ishaunted, and continues to be so. Borley is a ‘place of power’, the kind of placethat would be chosen for a monastery, and that probably held some pagan site ofworship long before that (See Chapter 15 [../Text/20_chapter15.html]). In theRectory’s early days, Harry Bull himself—son of the Reverend Henry Bull—wasprobably the unconscious focus or medium; Paul Tabori says that he was probablypsychic. This is borne out by the fact that young Bull saw so many of the‘ghosts’, including the coach and the nun. It is important to realise that notall people can see ghosts. The ‘ghost hunter’ Andrew Green describes, in OurHaunted Kingdom, a visit that he and other members of the Ealing PsychicalResearch Society paid to Borley in 1951:‘One of the Society members grabbed my arm and, although obviously terrified,proceeded to describe a phantom that he could see some thirty feet in front ofhim, standing at the end of the ‘Nun’s Walk’. It was of a Woman in a long whitegown, and moved slowly towards the end of the neglected garden . . . the witnesswas perspiring profusely with fear and, later with annoyance that I had failedto see the ghost.’Green had only heard the rustle of trees and bushes, as if something was walkingthrough the undergrowth. We may assume, then, that if Green had been a tenant ofBorley before its destruction, he would probably have seen no ghosts. Bull was,it seems, enough of a ‘medium’ to see the ghosts. And Marianne Foyster was a farmore powerful medium who changed the character of the haunting into poltergeistactivity. (Most of the messages scrawled on walls were addressed to her.) Thereason that the subsequent investigation of Borley (during Price’s tenancy) wasso unsuccessful was that there was no medium present to provide the energy.Asked about the ‘ley system’ of the Borley area, the ley expert Stephen Jenkinsreplied as follows: ‘Norfolk and Suffolk are a spider-web of alignments, many ofwhich are linked to curious manifestations. Borley church stands at a node wherefour lines cross, one going from Asher church to Sproughton church . . .’ Aftergiving further details of the ley system, he goes on:‘My wife photographed me as I was standing with my back to the south wall ofBorley churchyard, at ten o’clock on the morning of Saturday the 1st ofSeptember, 1979. Recently, this was borrowed for a magazine article, and theeditor kindly sent me an enlargement. No less than three people, not one of themknown to the others, have on separate occasions noted in the enlargement someodd—and not very prepossessing—faces among the trees close to the church. Thesame identifications have been made without possibility of collusion.‘More dramatic than unexpected faces in a photograph, which can always beexplained away as ‘simulacra’, or something wrong with the emulsion, is anincident of Sunday the 28th of August, 1977, on the road north of BelchampWalter Hall. The time was precisely 12.52 pm, and we were driving south westalong the minor road which marks the north end of the Hall grounds, when on theroad in front, in the act of turning left into the hedge (I mean our left,across the path of the car), instantaneously appeared four men in black—Ithought them hooded and cloaked—carrying a black, old-fashioned coffin, ornatelytrimmed with silver. The impression made on both of us was one of absolutephysical presence, of complete material reality. Thelma and I at once agreed tomake separate notes without comparing impressions. We did so, and thedescriptions tallied exactly, except that she noted the near left bearer turnhis face towards her. I did not see this as I was abruptly braking at the time.‘What I had seen as a hood, she described as a soft tall hat, with a kind ofscarf falling to the left shoulder, thrown across the cloaked body to the right.The face was that of a skull . . .‘The next day we returned to the precise spot at exactly the same time and tooka picture. It is a Kodak colour slide. In the hedge near the gap where the‘funeral party’ vanished (there is a path there leading to Belchamp Walterchurchyard) is a short figure, apparently cloaked, its face lowered with askull-like dome to the head. A year later I returned searching the area where ithad apparently stood. There was nothing, no post or stump that might haveprovided such an image, nor was there the slightest sign of the ground havingbeen disturbed by the removal of anything that might have been rooted in it. Theimage is simply there on the film—we saw nothing wrong with the eye.‘That minor road alongside the north edge of the Belchamp Walter Estateprecisely coincides with a line passing through the node in the water west ofHeaven Wood. That node itself linked with the node at Borley.’He adds a postscript: ‘I hazard a guess that the dress of the coffin-bearer isthat of the late 14th century. There seems to be no local legend of a phantomfuneral.’If Price invented the ghosts of Borley, he must have been in collusion with aremarkable number of people.‘I did not like [Harry Price] because he was a difficult man to like. He wasintensely selfish, jealous, and intent on his own glory at all costs, but theseweaknesses of his character do not detract from his investigation as an honestinvestigator and ruthless exposer of frauds. This was the shining feature of hislife.’These words were written by another man who deserves to be remembered as one ofthe prominent ghost-hunters of the 20th century. Unlike Price, Nandor Fodorseems to have had no great compulsion to achieve personal glory; the result isthat, since his death in 1964, his name has been largely forgotten, and most ofhis books are out of print. Yet at least one of his books—his account of theThornton Heath poltergeist case—deserves the status of a classic.Fodor was born in Hungary in 1895, studied law, then became a journalist, andvisited America. In 1926, he interviewed two remarkable men: HerewardCarrington, the psychical researcher, and Sandor Ferenczi, one of Freud’s mostprominent disciples. Fodor became simultaneously fascinated by psychoanalysisand psychical research and, in due course, became himself a psychoanalyst.Predictably, therefore, his analysis of poltergeist cases is dominated by theconviction that they have a sexual origin. But since—as we have seen—there is alarge element of truth in this view, Fodor’s psychoanalytical beliefs distortedhis outlook rather less than is often the case with Freudians.Fodor attended his first seance at the house of a well-known American medium,Arthur Ford, in October 1927, and what he heard there left him in no doubt thatthe dead can communicate. In the semi-darkness, a trumpet sailed up into theair, then a voice began to speak. Various relatives of people who were presentthen came and (apparently) talked through the medium. Fodor then asked if the‘control’ could bring someone who spoke Hungarian. It was, perhaps, anunreasonable request, but an excellent test for the medium. And after a fewmoments, a voice spoke from the air saying: ‘Fodor, journalist’, using theGerman pronunciation of the word—just as Fodor’s father did. Then the entityproceeded to speak to Fodor in Hungarian. The voice identified itself as Fodor’sfather, and mentioned various relatives; it named his oldest brother by his petname. The ‘spirit’ was having great difficulty communicating—because, explainedthe control, it was the first time he had tried to speak. The control helped outby telling Fodor that his father died on January 16. The ‘spirit’ ended bysaying ‘Isten áldjon meg. édes fiam’—‘God bless you, my dear son’. After this,another Hungarian came through—the deceased brother of Fodor’s wife, who waspresent. It mentioned that ‘poor Uncle Vilmos’ was ill and would go blind. And,in due course, this is exactly what happened to Uncle Vilmos.It emerged later that the medium—a man called Cartheuser—could speak Hungarian.Yet this scarcely helps to explain his knowledge of Fodor’s father, and theprophecy about Uncle Vilmos. Cartheuser also had a speech impediment, due to ahare-lip; the voices had no such impediment.Fodor came to England to work for Lord Northcliffe—owner of the Daily Mail—and,in his spare time, compiled an Encyclopedia of Psychic Science, which is stillone of the best available (a new edition combines it with a similar work byLewis Spence). After publishing the book, in 1934, Fodor had first-handexperience of the ambiguous nature of ‘psychic phenomena’. He heard of aremarkable Hungarian medium called Lajos Pap, a carpenter, whose speciality wascausing ‘apports’ of live birds, animals and beetles to appear at seances. InJune 1933, Fodor attended such a seance in Budapest. Pap was undressed andsearched, then dressed again in a robe of luminous cloth, so that his movementsin the dark could be clearly seen. Two men held Pap’s wrists during the seance,although he could move his hands with their hands on him. In an hour-longseance, Pap groped into the air and produced thirty live beetles, many of theman inch long. He also produced a cactus plant with soil on the roots and a rosebush. On other occasions, Pap had produced birds, caterpillars, dragonflies,snakes and a live goldfish. His ‘control’, the Rabbi Isaac (who claimed to havelived six hundred years earlier in Galicia) had a sense of humour. At oneseance, a toy pistol arrived, and a number of explosive caps were fired; theRabbi claimed to have shot dead twenty-one crickets and, after the seance, deadcrickets were found in the room.On another occasion, nine lumps of dirty snow arrived during the seance, andproved to be mixed with horse manure and straw. The temperature in the room was72 degrees Fahrenheit, so it would have been difficult to keep the snow unmeltedfor long if it had been concealed under the medium’s robe.Fodor arranged for Lajos Pap to be brought to London. At a seance there a deadsnake, more than two feet long, appeared. Fodor was impressed; but henevertheless insisted that Pap should have an X-ray examination to find outwhether he could have anything secreted in his body. To Fodor’s surprise anddismay, Pap proved to be wearing a belt of linen and whalebone under his robe.He said it was a kind of rupture truss, because he had a dropped kidney; butFodor decided regretfully that this was where the dead snake had been hidden,and that it had been worked out through the neck of the robe. Accordingly, inhis subsequent report, ‘The Lajos Pap Experiments’, Fodor concluded that Pap’spsychic powers should be regarded as ‘not proven’. Yet he adds:‘Nor would I be willing to declare him a fraud and nothing but a fraud. Too longhas psychical research been the victim of the fatal delusion that a medium iseither genuine or fraudulent. It is a minimal assumption that mediumship means adissociation of personality. There was plenty of evidence that Lajos Pap wassuffering from such a dissociation.’In fact, Pap is still regarded as a non-fraudulent medium, and accounts of hisseances at which live birds and insects appeared seem to indicate that hispowers were remarkable.Fodor had been appointed Research Officer of the International Institute forPsychical Research. In November 1936, he was asked to investigate a case ofpoltergeist haunting at Aldborough Manor in Yorkshire. The bells for summoningservants had rung almost non-stop for five days, doors had opened and closed oftheir own accord, and two maids had seen a ghost above an ancient cradle. LadyLawson-Tancred, who lived in the house, was afraid she would have to move out ifthe haunting continued. But when Fodor arrived, it was already over. One of thetwo maids had had a nervous breakdown and left. The bells had rung during thenight she left and the following morning, then stopped. To Fodor, therefore, itwas clear that the maid was the ‘focus’ of the disturbance. Her nervousbreakdown was probably caused by the ‘drain’ upon her energies caused by thepoltergeist. The other maid, a very pretty girl, also had a strange power overanimals; birds would settle on her shoulders, and mice run into her hands. LadyLawson-Tancred thought that she might also be connected with the disturbances,and dismissed her. (Fodor seems to have explained to her the difference betweena poltergeist and a real ‘haunting’, where the house itself seems to concentratethe negative forces, as at Borley.) After this, Aldborough Manor becamepeaceful.The same solution was found in the case of a Chelsea poltergeist that disturbeda house with its knockings. Fodor went to the house, in Elm Park Gardens, andheard the rappings himself—he said they were like hammer blows. Fodor lookedaround for the focus, and soon found it: a 17-year-old servant girl namedFlorrie. He engaged her in conversation, and she told him that this was not herfirst experience of mysterious knockings—the same thing had happened at homefour years before, when she was 13. The children were all sent away, and whenthey returned, the knocking had stopped. Clearly, Florrie was quite unaware thatshe had been the ‘cause’ of the knockings.Fodor told the house’s owner, Dr Aidan Redmond, that Florrie was probably theunconscious medium. That night, the raps were like machine-gun fire. Dr Redmondregretfully sacked Florrie. And silence descended on the house.In July 1936, Fodor investigated a case in which the distinction between ghostand poltergeist becomes blurred; this was at Ash Manor, in Sussex, and hedisguises the family under the name of Keel. It is among the most remarkableghost stories ever recorded.The house was bought by the family in June 1934; when they said they could notpay the price demanded, the owner dropped his demand so surprisingly that theKeels decided there must be something wrong with the place, probably thesanitation. But the wife soon began to get extremely unpleasant feelings in abedroom that had been used for servants. (The previous owner said they had runaway.)The first manifestations were stamping noises from the attic. But this room hadno floorboards—only the bare joists. In November 1934 Mr Keel was awakened bythree violent bangs on his door. He went to his wife’s room down thecorridor—she had also heard them. This happened at 3 a.m. The next night, therewere two thumps on the door at the same time, and the following night, one loudthump. Keel went away on business for a few days, and when he returned, decidedto stay awake until 3 a.m. to see if anything happened. Nothing did, and he fellasleep. Then a violent bang woke him up. Although the room was dark, he couldsee quite clearly a small, oldish man dressed in a green smock, with muddybreeches and a handkerchief round his neck. He looked so solid and normal thatKeel was convinced this was an intruder and, when he got no reply, jumped out ofbed and tried to grab him. His hand went through him, and Keel fainted. When hecame to, he ran to his wife’s bedroom, babbling incoherently, and his wiferushed out to get some brandy. Outside her husband’s room she saw the feet andleggings of a man, then looked up and saw the same little old man. She was alsoable to see him quite clearly in the dark, although he did not seem to beshining. She observed that he was wearing a pudding basin hat, that his face wasvery red, ‘the eyes malevolent and horrid’, and that his mouth was dribbling.She also asked him who he was and what he wanted. When he made no reply, shetried to hit him. Her fist went through him, and she hurt her knuckles on thedoorpost. Her husband was in a faint in her room at the time, so he had not hadan opportunity to describe the man he saw; it was only later that they realisedboth had seen the same ghost.After this, they continued to see the little old man in green several times aweek. They also heard footsteps and knocking. The old man usually walked acrossKeel’s bedroom, appearing from the chimney on the landing, and vanished into acupboard which had once been a priest hole. After a while, the family ceased tobe afraid of him. The wife discovered that she could make him vanish byextending a finger and trying to touch him. The third time she saw him, the oldman raised his head, and Mrs Keel could see that his throat was cut and hiswindpipe was sticking out. One day she heard heavy footsteps approaching alongthe corridor, and thought it was her husband. Her bedroom door—which waslocked—flew open and invisible footsteps crashed across the room (although thefloor was carpeted), then the footsteps went upwards towards the ceiling, as ifthey were mounting a staircase. A trapdoor in the ceiling flew open, and thefootsteps continued in the attic—again, sounding as if they were on floorboards,although these had been removed. A dog in the room was terrified. Mrs Keel’s16-year-old daughter Pat was sleeping in her mother’s room, and witnessed thewhole episode. The man who sold them the house told them that there had been astaircase in the room, which he had had removed to replace it with thefireplace.Two psychical investigators who were called in declared that the house had beenbuilt on the site of a Druid stone circle, and that this explained why it washaunted. The ghost, they said, was a man called Henry Knowles, who had cut histhroat in 1819 when a milkmaid had jilted him.As the Research Officer for the International Institute, Fodor was called in toinvestigate; he had with him Mrs Maude ffoulkes, who also published the story ofthe manor house in her book True Ghost Stories later that year (thus providingindependent corroboration of the story). An amateur photographer had succeededin taking a picture of a dim shape on the haunted landing, so Fodor took his ownphotographic equipment.Fodor now had enough experience of hauntings to look for unhappiness in thehouse. The daughter, Pat, struck him as nervous and very jealous of anyattention given to her mother, and admitted to suffering from temper tantrums.On the first night, nothing happened. The next time, Fodor slept in the ‘hauntedroom’, but, apart from awful nightmares, had nothing to record. He decided toask the help of the famous American medium, Eileen Garrett, who happened to bein England. In late July Mrs Garrett came to the house and immediately hadstrong psychic impressions. The ghost, she said, was a man who had beenimprisoned nearby. There had been a king’s palace nearby, and the man had beentortured. He had something to do with a king called Edward. Her furtherobservations suggested that the ‘ghost’ she saw was not the same old man, forshe described him as sharp-featured, with blond hair, and said he had taken partin a rebellion against his half-brother, the king. (In fact, there were tworoyal castles in the area, Farnham and Guildford.)Mrs Garrett went into a trance, and was taken over by her trance personality,Uvani, an Arabian. Uvani made the interesting comment that hauntings take placeonly when there is someone in a ‘bad emotional state’ who can revivify oldunhappy memories. There were bad emotional states in this house, said Uvani.‘Life cannot die,’ said Uvani, ‘you can explode its dynamism, but you cannotdissipate its energy. If you suffered where life suffered, the essence that oncefilled the frame will take from you something to dramatise and live again.’About five hundred yards to the west of this house, said Uvani, there had been ajail in the early part of the 15th century, and many unfortunate men and womenhad died there. ‘There are dozens of unhappy souls about.’ (The early 15thcentury was the period of the battle of Agincourt, Joan of Arc, and many revoltsand rebellions. The plot against Edward the Fourth—by his brother the Duke ofClarence—was in 1470.)‘According to this’, says Fodor1, ‘our ghost was a spectral automaton, living onlife borrowed from human wrecks—a fascinating conception which was verydifferent from ordinary spiritualistic conceptions and very damning for theowners of the house.’Uvani then said that he would allow the ghost to take possession of MrsGarrett’s body. The medium grew stiff and her breathing became laboured. Sheseemed to be trying to speak, but was unable. The ‘spirit’ pointed to its lips,tapped them as if to signal it was dumb, then felt its throat gingerly. Hebeckoned to Fodor, then seized his hand in such a powerful grip that Fodorhowled with pain. Although another person present tried to help him free hishand, it was impossible. Fodor’s hand went numb, and was useless for days afterthe seance.The ‘man’ threw himself on his knees in front of Fodor, seemed to be pleading,and clicked his tongue as if trying to speak. Then it called ‘Eleison,eleison’—pleading for mercy in the words of the mass. Aware that the ghost wastaking him for its gaoler, Fodor tried to reassure it, and said they were tryingto help him. Finally, the man seemed reassured, and sat down. He began to speakin an odd, mediaeval English (unfortunately, tape recorders did not exist inthose days—it would have been fascinating to have an authentic example of theEnglish of Chaucer’s period), and spoke about the Earl of Huntingdon, callinghim ungrateful. It asked Fodor to help him find his wife, then raged about theDuke of Buckingham, (perhaps the one who led a rebellion against Richard III inthe late 15th century). It seemed that the Duke of Buckingham had offered theman ‘broad acres and ducats’ in exchange for his wife, then betrayed him. Thespirit identified itself as Charles Edward Henley, son of Lord Henley. On asheet of paper, it wrote its name, then ‘Lord Huntingdon’, and the word ‘Esse’,which was the mediaeval name for the village near the manor house. It made thecurious statement that Buckingham, the friend of his childhood, had ‘forced hereyes’, ‘her’ being his wife Dorothy. He added: ‘Malgré her father lies buried inEsse’, and went on: ‘You being friend, you proved yourself a brother, do notleave me, but help me to attain my vengeance.’Remembering that, according to the teachings of Spiritualism, it is remorse ordesire for vengeance that often keeps spirits bound to earth, Fodor and anothersitter, a Dr Lindsay, tried hard to persuade the spirit to abandon its hatred.Finally, it seemed to agree, then cried out, ‘Hold me, hold me, I cannot stay, Iam slipping . . .’ Then it was gone, and Mrs Garrett woke up.During this seance, the Keels had been present. Mrs Keel peered closely at themedium’s face while ‘Henley’ was speaking through her, and was horrified to seethat it now looked like the old man she had seen.But had the ghost been laid? Apparently not. Some time later, Keel rang Fodor totell him that the old man was back again, standing in the doorway and trying tospeak.Dr Lindsay, who had been present at the seance, had also had a remarkableexperience. At the College of Psychic Science, he had been involved in a seancewith another medium when the ghost of ‘Henley’ came through. He complained thatFodor had promised to stand by him, but that when he had come back the followingnight, there was no one there. The old man said he had seen his son, for whom hehad been searching, but not his wife.They had another session with Mrs Garrett that afternoon. Again, the ghost camethrough, and made more pleas for help, as well as saying a little more about hisbackground. He was not particularly informative; but the control, Uvani, hadsome interesting things to say. He asserted that the Keels had been ‘using’ theghost to ‘embarrass’ each other. What was being suggested was that theghost-laying ceremony would have worked if the Keels had not wanted to cling onto the ghost as a device for somehow ‘getting at’ one another.Following this hint, Fodor talked to Mrs Keel. She then admitted that Uvani wasright about the unhappiness in the household. Her husband was homosexual, sotheir sex lives left much to be desired. And the daughter was jealous of hermother—Fodor hints that it was a classic Oedipus complex. Mrs Keel was keepingup her spirits with drugs.Soon after this, the case began to reach a kind of climax. Mr Keel himself wasbecoming ‘possessed’ by the spirit, talking in his sleep and saying things about‘Henley’ and his life. Fodor sent him a transcription of the things Uvani hadsaid about the desire of the Keels’ to ‘hold on’ to the ghost; as a result, Keelrang him to admit he felt it was true.This confession had the effect that Fodor’s ‘ghost-laying ceremony’ had failedto achieve: the ghost of Ash Manor disappeared and did not return.This is undoubtedly one of the most interesting cases of haunting on record, fora number of reasons. First, the corroboration is impressive: the story was alsowritten up by Maude ffoulkes and published in 1936.1 And the participation ofEileen Garrett rules out any suggestion that Fodor might simply have inventedthe whole story—a suggestion that has been made about one of Harry Price’s mostimpressive cases, ‘Rosalie’.2 Second, the behaviour of the ghost seems to showthat the ‘tape recording’ theory of Lethbridge and Sir Oliver Lodge does notcover all hauntings: ‘Henley’ was clearly more than a ‘recording’. And third, itdemonstrates very clearly that there is no clear dividing line between a ghostand a poltergeist. This case started with bangings and rappings, and thendeveloped into a haunting. And, if we can accept Uvani’s statements as any kindof evidence, it also suggests that there are such things as ‘earth-bound’spirits, probably in dismaying abundance. The other implications—about thenature of such spirits—must be left until later.If Fodor had possessed Price’s flair for publicity, the ‘Henley’ case might havemade him as famous as Borley made Price. But he made no attempt to publicise it.Neither did he attempt to make capital out of a visit to study the talkingmongoose of Cashen’s Gap (except for a single chapter in a book), although hisinvestigation was rather more painstaking—if hardly more successful—thanPrice’s. (Fodor concluded that the mongoose was probably genuine, but deniedthat it was a poltergeist on the dubious grounds that poltergeists are alwaysinvisible; we have seen that ‘elementals’ are rather less easy to classify thanthis implies.) In fact, Fodor’s only flash of notoriety occurred almostaccidentally as a result of a libel action he brought against Psychic News. Hewas asked whether it was true that he wanted to take a medium, Mrs Fielding, tothe Tower of London to steal the Crown Jewels by psychic means, and he admittedthat this was true, and that he had been willing to go to prison if theexperiment had been successful. However, it had been forbidden by the othermembers of the International Institute. From then on, Fodor was known as the manwho wanted to ‘spirit away’ the Crown Jewels.Mrs Fielding was, in fact, the ‘focus’ of the most interesting and complexpoltergeist case he ever investigated. Mrs Fielding (Fodor calls her Mrs Forbesin his book On the Trail of the Poltergeist) was a 35 year-old London housewife,living* at Thornton Heath, an attractive woman with a 17-year-old son. Thedisturbances began on Friday February 19, 1938, as the Fieldings were in bed,and on the point of sleep. A glass shattered on the floor, and when they put onthe light, another glass flew past their heads. They put off the light, and theeiderdown flew up in their faces. They tried to switch on the light again, butthe bulb had been removed. A pot of face cream was thrown at their son when hecame in to see what was happening. The next day, cups, saucers and ornamentsflew through the air. They notified the Sunday Pictorial, and two reporterscame. The poltergeist obliged with an impressive display. A cup and saucer inMrs Fielding’s hand shattered and cut her badly, a huge piece of coal struck thewall with such force that it left a big hole, an egg cup shattered in the handof one reporter, and Mrs Fielding was thrown out of her chair by some force. AsMr Fielding went upstairs, a vase flew through the air and struck him with acrash—yet although he looked dazed, his head was not bruised. Within three daysof the coming of the poltergeist, it had broken thirty-six tumblers, twenty-fourwine glasses, fifteen egg-cups and a long list of other articles.When Fodor arrived a few days later, the poltergeist did not disappoint. Fodorrecords twenty-nine poltergeist incidents during that first visit. Again andagain, he had his eyes on Mrs Fielding when things happened—glasses flew offtables, a saucer smashed against the wall, glasses were snatched from her handsand broke on the floor. It was soon clear that Mrs Fielding, and not her17-year-old son, was the focus and ‘cause’ of the disturbances. One glass flewout of her hand and split in mid-air with a loud ping, as if it had been hit bya hammer.Fodor asked Mrs Fielding to come to the headquarters of the Institute, WaltonHouse, for tests. She was dressed in a one-piece garment after being searched (aprecaution he may have learned from the Lajos Pap case) and they went into theseance room. While Mrs Fielding was standing in full view, with three witnessesaround her, there was a clatter, and a brass-bound hair brush appeared on thefloor. It was warm, as ‘apports’ usually are (the theory being that they are‘dematerialised’ and then rematerialised). Mrs Fielding identified it as herown, and said she had left it in her bedroom at home. The poltergeist thenobliged with several more apports, and also made saucers fly out of MrsFielding’s hands and split with a ping in mid-air. Strong men found that theycould not break them in their hands.The idea of stealing the Crown Jewels probably came to Fodor when he and MrsFielding went into a gift shop and she decided against buying a small elephant;as they were getting into the car, a box in Mrs Fielding’s hand rattled, andthey found the elephant in it; they had committed ‘psychic shop-lifting’.At a later ‘sitting’, Mrs Fielding produced some impressive results. On oneoccasion she sat with her hands tightly clenched while someone held them. Theperson holding them felt one hand convulse ‘as if something was being born’, andwhen Mrs Fielding opened her hand, there was a tortoiseshell cross in it.She also began to experience ‘psychic projections’, finding herself in otherplaces in her trance states. In the seance room, in a semi-trance, she projectedherself back to her home. They telephoned her husband, who said she was there,and even handed her the telephone; at that moment, they were cut off. MrsFielding’s ‘double’ handed her husband a recipe that she had written in theseance room; he read it back to them over the telephone, and it was identicalwith the one they had in front of them. He also handed the ‘double’ a compass,which then reappeared in the seance room, ten miles away. The ‘double’ hadwalked out of the front door with the compass.A full account of Mrs Fielding’s phenomena would occupy a whole chapter. Sheproduced some ancient artifacts like Roman lamps and pottery labelled‘Carthage’, white mice and a bird, and a spray of violet perfume around her body(as well as violets which fell from the air). Under increasing strain, shestarted to show signs of breakdown. She began going hysterically blind, burnmarks appeared on her neck, and she claimed she was being clawed by an invisibletiger (producing an unpleasant ‘zoo’ odour). When her husband said jokingly thathe would like an elephant, there was a crash and an elephant’s tooth appeared inthe hall. She also had a phantom pregnancy.At a seance, a spirit that claimed to be her grandfather declared that he wasresponsible for the apports. Asked to prove its identity by bringing somethingof its own, it materialised a silver matchbox—which Mrs Fielding said hadbelonged to her grandfather—in her clasped hands.And at this point, the story took a bewildering turn. Mrs Fielding apparentlybegan cheating. Fodor saw her producing a ‘breeze’ during a seance by blowing onthe back of someone’s neck. Fodor became convinced that she was producing small‘apports’ from under her clothes, and an X-ray photograph showed a brooch hiddenbeneath her left breast. Later, she produced this brooch as an apport. Whenbeing undressed, a small square of linen fell from between her legs, stainedwith vaginal secretion; it looked as if she was also using her vagina to hideapports.Two days after this, she claimed to have been attacked by a vampire. There weretwo small puncture marks on her neck, and she looked listless and pale.One of the oddest incidents occurred when Fodor was walking with her into theInstitute. With no attempt at concealment, she opened her handbag, tooksomething out, and threw a stone over her shoulder. When Fodor asked her aboutthis, she indignantly denied it.In his account of the case in The Haunted Mind, Fodor makes the statement: ‘Thisdiscovery . . . eliminated any remaining suspicion that a spirit or psychicforce was still at work.’ But the ‘still’ implies that he felt there had beengenuine psychic forces at work at an earlier stage. Reading his full account ofthe case, this seems self-evident. It would have been impossible for MrsFielding to have faked the poltergeist occurrences in her home, and later in theInstitute.Fodor’s own analysis is as follows:As a child, Mrs Fielding was both accident- and illness-prone. At the age of 6,recovering from tonsillitis, she thought that a muscular black arm tried tostrangle her in bed; it vanished when her mother ran in. She was bitten by a maddog, and attacked (and scarred) by a parrot. She lived in a house with areputation for being haunted, and Fodor states as a fact that neither thewindows nor mirrors ever needed cleaning—they were cleaned by invisible handsduring the night.At 16, she had ‘visions’ of a ghost; a cupboard in her room opened and a manstepped out, then vanished. Subsequently she saw him several times. On oneoccasion he left a piece of paper with sooty scrawls on it beside her, but hermother burned it. A bicycle accident at this time led to a kidney abscess, whichlater necessitated many operations. At 17 she made a runaway marriage, had herfirst baby at 18, her second at 21. (This died of meningitis.) At 20 shecontracted anthrax poisoning, and tried to stab her husband with a carvingknife. She ran into the street in her nightdress screaming ‘Murder, fire’, andrecovered after having twenty-eight teeth extracted.At 24 she had a vision of her father, trying to pull her away from her husband.He made the sign of the cross over her left breast. When she woke from hertrance, this was bleeding. At hospital they discovered she had a breast cancer,and the breast was amputated. At 26, she had an attack of hysterical blindnesswhich lasted for six weeks and, at 27, was in an accident on a steamer which wassmashed against Margate pier. At 28 she aborted twins after being terrified whenshe found a dead rat in among her washing. At 30 she had a kidney operation,and, at 32, pleurisy. Altogether, it can be seen, Mrs Fielding was a thoroughlyunlucky woman.Fodor then proceeds to interpret the evidence from the Freudian point of view.He is convinced that the basic truth is that Mrs Fielding was attacked andraped, probably in a churchyard, by a man in round glasses, before she was 5years old. Everything else, he thinks, springs from this trauma. On twooccasions, when lying awake at night, she felt a shape like a man—but as cold asa corpse—get into bed with her; then it ‘behaved like a man’ (i.e. had sexualintercourse). One day, on her way to the Institute, Mrs Fielding was attacked bya man on the train. Fodor does not doubt that she was attacked—she arrived in anupset condition—but thinks that the man’s round glasses may have aroused in hera mixture of loathing and desire which was wrongly interpreted by the man as aninvitation. Fodor goes on to suggest that her husband became somehow identifiedin her mind with her attacker, so that the poltergeist attacks were due to herunconscious aggressions against him.There are times when Fodor’s Freudian interpretations verge on the comic. Forexample, he is convinced that her apports are a cipher ‘in which her tragic lifestory is hidden’. On one evening, the apports were: elephant’s tooth, tigerclaw, Carthage pottery, a tropical nutshell and a piece of coral. These, saysFodor, symbolise the hugeness of the man who assaulted her (an elephant), hissavagery and beastliness, his scaliness (the nutshell), while the potterysymbolises the breaking of her hymen; the coral stands for music from the churchnearby. (Organ music always made Mrs Fielding cry, and Fodor surmises that thecoral was organ-pipe coral.)There is, of course, one basic objection to the whole theory: Mrs Fielding didnot tell Fodor she had been raped, and apparently had no such memory. Fodornaturally thinks it was suppressed. But do memories of that type become sosuppressed that they vanish completely? It seems highly unlikely.Fodor was never able to bring the case to a satisfactory conclusion. When hebegan explaining his rape theories to the Institute for Psychical Research, theyobjected so strongly that he felt obliged to drop the case. At least it enabledhim to believe that Mrs Fielding was getting closer and closer to rememberingher rape experience, and would one day have confirmed all his theories. It willbe recalled that, in the case of the Bell Witch, Fodor believed that Betsy hadbeen sexually attacked by her father, and that this produced the poltergeist,‘tearing loose part of the mental system and letting it float free like adisembodied entity’. As a good Freudian, he felt bound to seek a sexualexplanation in the Thornton Heath case. Yet, like so many of the ‘primal scenes’that Freud believed caused lifelong illness, the one posited by Fodor iscompletely unverifiable.It would be a pity to leave this case without at least an attempt at analternative explanation. And the simplest and most obvious is that Mrs Fieldingwas a born medium. Her many illnesses turned her into what 19th centuryinvestigators liked to call a ‘sick sensitive’. Her vision of the black arm thattried to strangle her in bed may not have been a dream or hallucination, asFodor thinks. If she lived in a haunted house, then it seems likely that spiritentities drew energy from her, increasing her tendency to illness. And later inlife, she actually developed into a medium. During the investigation, she oftenwent into trances, and a ‘control’ called Bremba spoke through her. Sitting neara pub—and a church—in Coulsdon, she had a vision of an evil, leering face, whichshe continued to see for ten minutes. ‘Bremba’ later stated at a seance that theman she saw had belonged to the church, and had been hanged for interfering withsmall children. ‘She was probably sitting on the spot where one of the outragestook place.’ When Mrs Fielding came out of her trance, she could not speak oreven whisper, then, as they all watched, strangulation marks appeared on herthroat. When she could speak she said: ‘I feel as if I am being pulled up’—as ifshe was suffering from the man’s hanging. Later, when she was telling friendsabout it, the noose marks again appeared on her throat. Fodor uses this as asupport for his theory about the early rape; but it could, in fact, be ordinarymediumship. Bremba could have been telling the truth about the man hanged forsexual offences against children.Then why did Mrs Fielding begin to cheat? There are two possible explanations.One is that she was enjoying her new position as a subject of investigation. Shewas a bored housewife, and, as Fodor says, the phenomena meant ‘a new interest,a new life for her’. This could be true; but if Mrs Fielding was developinggenuine powers as a medium, then she had no need to cheat in order to keep them.It sounds as if they had been latent since childhood; all she had to do was toallow them to develop.The other explanation is that she was unconscious that she was cheating—whichwould explain the stone thrown in front of Fodor, with no attempt atconcealment, and her subsequent denial. In a case cited by William Roll, a manbeing investigated was seen, through a one-way mirror, to throw an object—yet alie detector test supported his denial that he had done it. We have seen thatthere is considerable evidence that poltergeists can enter the mind andinfluence people—mediums more than others.To anyone who reads straight through Fodor’s On the Trail of the Poltergeist, itseems obvious that the ‘spirit entity’ theory fits better than most. Both theFieldings had been ill for some time before the first outbreak. So Mrs Fieldingmay have been in a suitably ‘low’ condition to enable the entity to begin usingher energy. From then on, it used her continually, and accordingly she began tosuffer from nervous exhaustion. Yet her attitude towards all this must have beenambiguous, for it brought new interest into her life; this could have enabledthe entity—or entities—to manipulate her to cheat. And why should they? Because,for some reason, poltergeists seem to delight in producing bewilderment andconfusion.The one point that emerges above all others is that Mrs Fielding was not justthe focus of the poltergeist disturbances: she was a medium, and soon began todevelop her ability, with apports, travelling clairvoyance, projection of the‘double’, and so on. In short, Mrs Fielding was a potential Daniel Dunglas Homeor Eusapia Palladino. And this, it seems probable, is true for all the peoplewho became ‘focuses’ for poltergeist phenomena. With her illnesses, her earlymarriage, even the loss of her teeth, Mrs Fielding calls to mind another medium,the ‘Seeress of Prevorst’, whose history we have looked at in an earlierchapter. Nandor Fodor, like Justinus Kerner, was a medical man. Yet it cannot besaid that his study of Mrs Fielding is as penetrating or a suggestive asKerner’s study of Friederike Hauffe. To read On the Trail of the Poltergeistafter The Seeress of Prevorst is a depressing experience. It is to realise thata century of psychical research has brought very few advances—that, on thecontrary, an unimaginative and over-cautious approach to the phenomena has onlymade them less comprehensible than ever. 1. The Haunted Mind, Chapter 8 [../Text/13_chapter08.html].1. It is also described in Unbidden Guests by William O. Stevens, 1945.2. See The Occult, Part 3, Chapter 2 [../Text/07_chapter02.html]."},{"pageContent":"9The Spirit MafiaCONSIDERING THAT poltergeists have been recorded for more than a thousand years,and that eminent scientists have been studying them for about a century, itseems a little surprising that they are still regarded as an insoluble mystery.In the past two decades, there have been three major scientific studies of thepoltergeist: Dr A.R.G.Owen’s Can We Explain the Poltergeist?, William Roll’s ThePoltergeist, and Poltergeists by Alan Gauld and Tony Cornell. All three raisethe question of whether poltergeists could be spirits of the dead or other typesof disembodied entity; all three decide that this is unlikely, and thattherefore poltergeists are probably some kind of manifestation of the unconciousmind: that is, of ‘spontaneous psychokinesis’. Owen points out that a largenumber of children in poltergeist cases have mental problems; Roll notes thatmost objects tends to move counter-clockwise, and suggests that there is somekind of whirlpool or psychic vortex that drags them into motion. But no oneexplains why poltergeist effects are so much more powerful than the kind ofpsychokinesis that has been studied in the laboratory.There is, admittedly, one case that seems to be an exception to this rule. Inthe early 1970s, members of the Toronto Society for Psychical Research, underthe direction of A.R.G. Owen, decided to try to manufacture a ghost. For thispurpose, they invented the case history of a man called Philip, a contemporaryof Oliver Cromwell, who had an affair with a beautiful gypsy girl. When Philip’swife found out, she had the girl accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake;Philip committed suicide.Having elaborated this story and created a suitable background—an ancient manorhouse—they set about trying to conjure up the spirit of Philip. For severalmonths, there were no results. Then one evening, as they were relaxing andsinging songs, there was a rap on the table. They used the usual code (one rapfor yes, two for no), to question the ‘spirit’, which claimed to be Philip andrepeated the story they had invented for him. At later seances, Philip made thetable dance all around the room, and even made it levitate in front of TVcameras.Owen’s group rightly regarded this ‘creation’ of a ghost as something of atriumph, making the natural assumption that Philip was a product of theirunconscious minds. But this assumption is questionable. What they did, ineffect, was to hold a series of seances until they got results. Philip may havebeen a manifestation of their collective unconscious minds. Or he may have beenanother of those bored and untruthful ‘spirits’ we have already encountered,joining in the game for want of anything better to do. The Philip case cannot beregarded as a proof or disproof of the psychokinesis theory.The trouble is that when scientists start looking for patterns, they areinclined to see what they are expecting to see. If they are good scientists,they finally notice the facts that contradict their theories, and modify thetheories. But this sometimes takes a very long time; sometimes, it never happensat all.On the whole, the scientist is better off if he collects his facts by accident,little by little, so he can study them before he tries to fit them into a jigsawpuzzle. This is how the late Tom Lethbridge came to arrive at his theories aboutother dimensions of reality. It is also how Guy Lyon Playfair came to develophis own theories about the nature of the poltergeist.In 1961, Guy Playfair had been down from Cambridge for two years—he hadgraduated in modern languages—and was finding life in England difficult andrather boring. And when he saw an advertisement in the personal column of TheTimes saying that teachers were wanted for Rio de Janeiro at £1,000 a year, heapplied immediately. He signed a two-year contract, and at the end of the twoyears decided to stay on in Rio as a freelance journalist. He was reasonablysuccessful, working as a correspondent for Time and The Economist, then as awriter in the information section of the US Agency for InternationalDevelopment. When Nixon cut the foreign budget in 1971, Guy Playfair was offereda golden handshake, and took it; as a result he was able to move into acomfortable house with a good view of the harbour.One of his neighbours was an American film actor called Larry Carr, and it wasthrough him that Playfair became involved in the world of Brazilian Spiritism.One day, Carr asked him casually if he would like to go and watch a healer. Justas casually—having nothing better to do—Playfair accepted. They drove out to aSpiritist centre in an area full of warehouses and run-down bars—’the kind ofstreet you end up in if you get lost on the way to an airport’. The healer, aman named Edivaldo, was late, having had to drive five hundred miles from hishome town; he was a school-teacher who, with his spectacles and neat moustache,looked more like a bank clerk, or possibly a bank manager. When Playfair’s groupentered the consulting room, Edivaldo would prod the area that was giving thetrouble, write something on a prescription pad, and pass on to the next. WhenPlayfair’s turn came, Edivaldo’s hand went straight to the spot on his stomachwhich had been giving him trouble; pills were prescribed, and Playfair was toldto come back later for ‘a little operation’. A few months later, he went backfor his operation. When he went into the room, an old man was lying on the bed,and Edivaldo was bending over him. The old man’s stomach had been ripped open,exposing the entrails. Playfair admits that he did not observe as well as hemight because he found it all too bewildering. ‘He was sloshing around inblood—it was a pretty gruesome sight.’ He looked away for a moment, and when helooked back again, the man’s stomach was ‘all neat and tidy’, and was beingcovered with bandage. The man got up, and was helped out by his wife. One of thehelpers told Playfair to lie down on the bed. He unbuttoned his shirt. Edivaldocame over and ran his hand over his stomach, then his hands seemed to find whatthey were looking for and he pressed. Playfair felt a distinct plop and thehands entered his skin and went into his stomach. ‘My stomach immediately feltwet all over, as if I were bleeding to death. I could feel a sort of ticklinginside, but no pain at all.’ He seemed to smell ether. Then it was all over andhe was told he could get up and go home. He felt curiously stiff as if hismiddle had been anaesthetised, unable to bend. (This so intrigued him that helater tried to reproduce the same effect—with the aid of a friendly doctor whogave him twenty jabs of local anaesthetic: ‘It wasn’t the same thing at all.’)When he got home, he had to take off his shoes by kicking each one off with theother foot. On his stomach there was a jagged red line where Edivaldo hadpressed his thumbs, and two bright red dots nearby.Later, after a second operation, two more red dots appeared. And Playfair’sstomach complaint, though not permanently cured, was considerably eased.Some time later, Playfair interviewed Edivaldo, and heard the remarkable storyof how he had become a healer. One evening in 1962 he had been called in to sitwith a neighbour who had gone temporarily insane. He became unconscious, andduring this period he smashed up the room. But when he recovered consciousness,the woman was cured. Soon after that, he visited a woman who had become rigidafter childbirth. He suddenly became rigid himself, and the woman’s rigiditydisappeared. It was clear that he was somehow ‘taking on’ the illness of otherpeople. A psychiatrist told him he was probably a medium, and advised that heshould go to a Spiritist centre. The first evening he did this, he again wentinto a trance. When he came to, he was being driven home, and was told that hehad performed several operations. Apparently he was ‘taken over’ by variousspirits who had been surgeons while alive—a Dr Calazans, a Frenchman calledPierre, a Londoner called Johnson, and a German called Dr Fritz, who also workedthrough the famous psychic surgeon Arigó.For another year, Playfair continued to spend a great deal of time at Edivaldo’ssurgeries, and watched innumerable operations—on one occasion, Edivaldo (orrather, the ‘spirit’ who was controlling him) took Playfair’s hand and thrust itinto the open stomach. By this time, he was convinced he had discovered thesubject he wanted to write about. He began to attend Spiritist sessions(Spiritism is Brazil’s version of Spiritualism, and is based on the teachings ofKardec). When he encountered Hernani Andrade, founder of the IBPP—BrazilianInstitute for Psycho Biophysical Research—he decided to move from Rio de Janeiroto São Paulo, a move that struck his friends as eccentric, since it is theequivalent of moving from, let us say, the Cornish Riviera to the industrialMidlands, or from Florida to Detroit. But Andrade offered Guy Playfair full andunrestricted access to his files, as well as the insights of forty years ofSpiritism. As a consequence, Playfair’s interest came to extend from psychichealing to poltergeists, reincarnation, black magic and life-after-death.In São Paulo, he began by investigating more psychic surgeons. Then he heard ofa case of poltergeist haunting, and offered to help the IBPP look into it.At the time he heard about it, in 1973, the case had been going on for about sixyears. The family consisted of a Portuguese mother, who had been married to aLithuanian immigrant, and was now divorced. She had a son and daughter, bothadults. There had been the usual bangs and crashes, clothing and bedding hadcaught fire, or had been soaked with water; and as a result of thesedisturbances, the family had already moved house three times. There also seemedto be some evidence of black magic involved; photographs of a girl with threadstitched through it had been found in the house. The troubles had begun afterthe son of the family had married a girl called Nora.It was to their house that Guy Playfair went in October 1973, taking his taperecorder with him. He sat up into the early hours of the morning, reading FrankPodmore—one of the early psychic investigators—on the subject of poltergeists.Podmore came to the conclusion that they are invariably fakes—an example of thekind of stupidity to which members of the SPR occasionally seem to besubject—and at this stage, Playfair thought he might well be correct. Finally,just as he was on the point of dozing off to sleep, he was awakened by a seriesof bangs that shook the house. The poltergeist had arrived. Playfair was struckby the timing—that it began as he was drifting off to sleep; the same thing hadhappened to Suzuko Hashizume, the investigator who had spent the previous nightin the house. Playfair subsequently came to suspect that poltergeists have anuncanny sense of timing which suggest that they are able to foretell the exactmoment when the investigator will be looking the other way.There was something odd about the bangs. They caused nothing to vibrate, as suchbangs normally do, and they seemed to echo longer than they should. Kardec hasnoted in The Medium’s Book:Spirit sounds are usually of a peculiar character; they have an intensity and acharacter of their own, and, notwithstanding their great variety, can hardly bemistaken, so that they are not easily confused with common noises, such as thecreaking of wood, the crackling of a fire, or the ticking of a clock; spiritraps are clear and sharp, sometimes soft and light . . .’In fact, a researcher, Dr J.L. Whitton, subjected tape-recording of ‘spiritraps’ to laboratory analysis, and found that they are quite different incharacter from normal raps. Shown on a graph, an ordinary sound has adistinctive curve, rising and falling like the slopes of a mountain; spirit rapsbegin and end abruptly, like cliffs. In fact, they seem to be ‘manufactured’noises, as if the poltergeist had a BBC sound laboratory at its disposal and hadto concoct the noises electronically.The other odd thing about these loud bangs was that they did not disturb thefour dogs, which had barked themselves frantic when Guy Playfair arrived; eitherthey failed to hear them or accepted them as perfectly normal.These bangs were followed by more, at intervals. Later, Playfair tried to makesimilar bangs by thumping the end of a broom handle on the floor; it wasimpossible to make them as loud.The following night, when Playfair was asleep in the downstairs room, afootstool bounced down the stairs, then a bedroom drawer full of clothes washurled out of a window into the yard. A pillow shot out from under Nora’s headand flew across the room. Again and again, Playfair noted the poltergeist’ssense of timing—how things seemed to happen precisely as people were fallingasleep or waking up. Bumps happened mainly at night. Outbreaks of fire couldhappen at any time—on one occasion, a wardrobe full of clothes caught fire, andwould have burned the house down if it had not been caught in time.At this point, the IBPP called in their poltergeist-clearance team of mediums,who went into the house, sat in the kitchen, and asked their spirit guides topersuade the poltergeist to move. After this, there was silence for two weeks;then minor disturbances began again. This time, the family decided to call in acandomblé specialist—candomblé being one of the largest of Brazil’s manyAfrican-influenced cults. This man brought with him a team of helpers. He toldthe family that this struck him as a particularly nasty case of black magic.Rites were performed and incense burned. And at the end of it all, thepoltergeist finally left the family in peace. (At least, it had not reappearedby the time Playfair wrote his book about two years later.)Now the notion of a poltergeist being associated with black magic is one thatEuropean investigators will find bizarre and outlandish. But in Brazil, it istaken for granted. Hernani Andrade is quoted as saying:In every case of person-directed poltergeist activity where I have been able tostudy the family background, there has been evidence that somebody in the housecould be the target of revenge from a spirit. It may be a former lover whocommitted suicide, a jealous relation, a spiteful neighbour, or even a member ofthe same family bearing some trivial grudge. Any Brazilian is well aware thatthis country is full of backyard terreiros of quimbanda (black magic centres)where people use spirit forces for evil purposes.‘You can use a knife to cut bread or to cut a man’s throat, and so it is withthe hidden powers of man; they can be turned to good or bad ends, though theyremain the same powers. To produce a successful poltergeist, all you need is agroup of bad spirits prepared to do your work for you, for a suitable reward,and a susceptible victim who is insufficiently developed spiritually to be ableto resist. Black magic is a really serious social problem in Brazil, and we mustfind reliable ways of getting rid of it.’Playfair goes on to cite another case in a town near São Paulo, in which thepoltergeist made a number of attempts to burn the baby. One day, the babydisappeared, and the mother heard stifled cries coming from a laundry basket.She rushed to it and found the baby buried inside dirty clothes, in the processof stifling to death. The poltergeist also smashed furniture and wrecked theroof by pounding on it; when the family finally left the house, it looked as ifit had been hit by a bomb. All this is, of course, no proof that poltergeistscan be called up by magic, but it indicates that they can, on occasion, behavewith something like demonic malevolence.In his book The Indefinite Boundary, Playfair devotes a chapter called ‘The PsiUnderworld’ to this problem of magic and malevolence. He cites the disturbingcase of 11-year-old Maria José Ferreira, who, in December 1965, became thecentre of violent poltergeist activity. Pieces of brick began to fall inside thehouse, in Jabuticabal, near São Paulo, and an attempt at exorcism made thingsmuch worse. (Poltergeists, as we have seen, seem contemptuous of attempts toexorcise them.) A neighbour who knew about Kardec took the child into his house;things got worse, with bombardments of stones and eggs. One large stonedescended from the ceiling and split into two; when someone picked up the twopieces, they snapped together as if they were magnetically attracted to eachother. (We have already seen that poltergeists seem to have an affinity withelectricity; it is interesting to speculate whether the force that caused thestones to snap together was an example of ‘ley power’ or what has been called‘Telluric force’.)For a while, the poltergeist seemed to be in an amiable mood; Maria could askfor a flower or piece of candy, and it would instantly drop at her feet. Then,quite suddenly, the poltergeist began to attack her, biting her and slapping heron the face or bottom. It tried to suffocate her while she was asleep by placingcups or glasses over her mouth and nostrils. Then it began to set her clothes onfire.When Maria was taken to a Spiritist centre, the hope of ‘curing’ herdisappeared. A spirit came and spoke through the medium, saying: ‘She was awitch. A lot of people suffered, and I died because of her. Now we are makingher suffer too . . .’ Spirits, of course, are not invariably truthful, and thisone may have been inventing the tale that Maria had been a witch in a previousexistence. (Kardec, it must be remembered, taught reincarnation as an integralpart of Spiritism.) Special prayers and appeals to the spirits failed to stopthe attacks on the girl. And, when she was 13, she took a dose of ant killer ina soft drink and was dead when they found her. It would be interesting to knowwhether Maria took the poison deliberately, or whether the poltergeist placed itthere, as the ‘Bell Witch’ dosed John Bell’s medicine.All this makes it rather difficult to follow William Roll’s reasoning in thiscentral paragraph from his book on poltergeists:‘I do not know of any evidence for the existence of the poltergeist as anincorporeal entity other than the disturbances themselves, and these can beexplained more simply as PK effects from a flesh-and-blood entity who is attheir center. This is not to say that we should close our minds to thepossibility that some cases of RSPK might be due to incorporeal entities. Butthere is no reason to postulate such an entity when the incidents occur around aliving person. It is easier to suppose that the central person is himself thesource of the PK energy.’The source, possibly. But the whole cause of the phenomena? It is true that insome cases—perhaps the majority—we can interpret the disturbances as anunconscious attempt by the ‘focus’ to draw attention to his or her problems, asan unsuccessful suicide attempt does. Esther Cox’s manifestations ceased aftershe was put in prison. But if Maria’s unconscious aggressions were causing herclothes to catch on fire and bite marks to appear all over her body, surely thedespair that finally drove her to suicide would have reached through to therebellious part of her mind and persuaded it to stop? It simply fails to makesense to believe that Maria’s own unconscious aggressions drove her to killherself.The point is underlined by one of the most remarkable cases described by GuyPlayfair, that of a girl who inadvertently incurred a ‘black magic curse’. Hecalls her Marcia F and mentions that she had a master’s degree in psychology. InMay 1973, when Marcia was 28, she went for a family outing to the Atlantic coastnear São Paulo. As they walked along the beach, Marcia noticed something lyingin the sand—a plaster statue of a woman about six inches high, with much of thepaint worn off by the sea. She took it back home to her apartment, which sheshared with another girl—in spite of her aunt’s warning that it might bring badluck to take a statue of the sea goddess Yemanjá, which had obviously beenplaced there as an offering in return for some favour. But Marcia was a goodCatholic as well as a psychology graduate, and thought that the talk of bad luckwas nonsense. She placed it on her mantelpiece.Some days later she was violently ill with food poisoning after eatingchocolate. Then she began to lose weight and feel run down. Her vitality wasdraining away. She began to spit blood, and X-rays showed a patch on her lung.Yet a few weeks later the patch had disappeared—it would normally have taken atleast a year. After a holiday at home with her parents, Marcia returned to herflat. The pressure cooker blew up and she suffered second degree burns on herarms and face. Then the oven exploded, shooting out a sheet of flame towardMarcia; an engineer found the incident unexplainable. A few days later, a friendtold her that at the moment when her pressure cooker had exploded, Marcia’sphotograph had jumped from the wall in her parents’ home.When a friend warned her again about the statue of Yemanjá, Marcia againdismissed the idea as preposterous.Now she began to experience suicidal impulses. Crossing the road at a trafficlight, she suddenly felt a powerful desire to fling herself under the oncomingcars. Opening the window of her apartment (which was on the fifteenth floor) sheseemed to hear a voice inside her urging her to throw herself out.And at this point, the first unmistakable suggestion of witchcraft entered thecase. Her bedroom seemed to be full of presences. Then they entered her bed, andshe felt herself being touched all over. And one night, she felt the presence ofa male body, which moved on top of her; she felt a penis entering her, and laythere while the entity had sexual intercourse. This went on happening forseveral nights, until Marcia, wondering if she was going insane, went again tostay with her parents. There, by chance, they were visited by a Spiritist, towhom Marcia told her story. He advised her to go to the local umbandacentre—umbanda is the most popular Afro-Brazilian cult. She also took along thestatue, at the insistence of her flatmate. The director of the centre listenedto her story, and told her that her problem was undoubtedly a case of a blackmagic trabalho (work or job) being directed at her because of her removal of thestatue. It was only then that Marcia looked more closely at the statue—which hadonly patches of paint left on it—and realised suddenly that each remaining patchcorresponded to a part of her own body that had been damaged: the burn marks onher arms, neck and face matched exactly the paint on the statue, and the patchon the back was just above the ‘patch’ that had been found in her lung. Thestatue still had paint on its blue eyes, which was ominous. She took the adviceof the director, and returned the statue to the spot on the beach where she hadfound it. Immediately, the run of bad luck ceased.Playfair personally investigated the case of Marcia, and was not surprised whenshe told him that, as a result of her experience, her scepticism about ‘badluck’ and trabalho had given way to a more pragmatic attitude.Playfair’s observations received strong support from those of anotherinvestigator, his friend David St Clair, who has described his experiences ofBrazil in a book called Drum and Candle. He speaks of walking down CopacabanaAvenue with some friends on his first night in Rio, and noticing on the pavementa circle of burning candles around a clay statue of the devil. When he reachedout to touch it, one of his friends pulled him back, saying: ‘It’s despacho—anoffering to a spirit.’‘But you surely don’t believe that stuff?’ said St Clair. ‘You’re all collegegraduates.’ His friends admitted that they did not believe in it—butnevertheless would not allow him to touch the statue.After that, St Clair saw many such offerings. He saw offerings of cookedchicken, and the starving beggars who stared at them, then quietly went away. Heeven saw a dog sniff at such an offering, then back away.St Clair has many stories about candomblé and Spiritism. But the final chapterof the book describes his own experience of a trabalho. He had been living inRio de Janeiro for eight years, and had a comfortable apartment with a fineview. He also had an attractive maid named Edna, a pretty, brown-coloured girl.She was, he assures the reader, a maid and nothing more. Her life had been hard:deserted by the father, her family had been brought up in a shack in a slum. Shewas obviously delighted with the comfort and security of her job with St Clair.She joined a folk-dance group and, after a television appearance, becamesomething of a local celebrity. And one day, St Clair told her that he haddecided it was time for him to leave Brazil. Edna was now doing so well that hehad no doubt she would easily find another job; he told her he would give her 6months’ wages.Then things began to go wrong. A book he had written failed to make any headway;his typist made a mess of it, then fell ill so that it sat in her desk forweeks. A New York publisher rejected it. An inheritance he was expecting failedto materialise. His plans for moving to Greece had to be shelved. A love affairwent disastrously wrong, and a friend he asked for a loan refused it. He evenfell ill with malaria.One day, he met a psychic friend in the Avenida Copacabana; she took one look athim and said: ‘Someone has put the evil eye on you. All your paths have beenclosed.’ A few days later, another friend wrote to say he had been to an umbandasession, and a spirit had warned him that one of his friends was in grave dangerdue to a curse, all his paths had been closed.An actor friend—who was also a Spiritist—immediately divined that it was Ednawho had put the curse on him. St Clair thought this absurd. To begin with, Ednawas a Catholic, and had often expressed her disapproval of Spiritism andumbanda. But his actor friend told him he had attended a Spiritist session wherehe had been assured that David St Clair’s apartment was cursed. But how couldEdna do that, St Clair wanted to know. All she had to do, his friend replied,was to go to a quimbanda—black magic—session and take some item of his clothing,which could be used in a ritual to put a curse on him. And now his friendmentioned it, St Clair recalled that his socks had been disappearing recently.Edna had claimed the wind was blowing them off the line.St Clair told Edna he believed himself to be cursed; she pooh-poohed the idea.But he told her he wanted her to take him to an umbanda session. After muchprotest, she allowed herself to be forced into it.That Saturday evening, Edna took him to a long, white house in a remote areaoutside Rio. On the walls were paintings of the devil, Exú. Towards midnight,drums started up, and the negroes sitting on the floor began to chant. A ritualdance began. Then the umbanda priestess came in like a whirlwind—a huge negressdressed in layers of lace and a white silk turban. She danced, and the otherwomen began to jerk as if possessed. The priestess went out, and when she camein again, was dressed in red, the colour of Exú/Satan. She took a swig ofalcohol, then lit a cigar. After more dancing, she noticed St Clair, and offeredhim a drink from a bottle whose neck was covered with her saliva. Then she spata mouthful of the alcohol into his face. After more chanting, a medium was askedwho had put the curse on him. She replied: ‘The person who brought him heretonight! She wants you to marry her. Either that, or to buy her a house and apiece of land . . .’ The priestess ordered Edna to leave. Then she said: ‘Now wewill get rid of the curse.’ There was more ritual drumming and dancing, then thepriestess said: ‘Now you are free. The curse has been lifted, and it will nowcome down doubly hard upon the person who placed it on you.’ When he protested,he was told it was too late—it had already been done.Three days later, St Clair received a telegram from a magazine, asking for astory; he had suggested it to them months before but they had turned it down.Now, unexpectedly, they changed their minds, and sent him money. A week later,the inheritance came through. The book was accepted. And ten days later hereceived a letter asking if his broken love affair could be restarted where ithad left off. Then Edna became ill. A stomach-growth was diagnosed, and she hadto have an operation, for which St Clair paid. But her health continued todecline. She went to see an umbanda priest, who told her that the curse she hadput on St Clair had rebounded on her, and that she would suffer as long as shestayed near him. She admitted trying to get him to marry her by black magic. Shedeclined his offer to buy her a house or an apartment, and walked out of hislife.In The Indefinite Boundary, Playfair goes on to discuss black magic. It seems,he says, to be based on an exchange of favours between incarnate anddiscarnate—man and spirit:‘Incarnate man wants a favour done; he wants a better job, to marry a certaingirl, to win the state lottery, to stop somebody from running after his daughter. . . Discarnate spirits, for their part, want to enjoy the pleasures of theflesh once more; a good square meal, a drink of the best cachaça rum, a finecigar, and perhaps even sexual relations with an incarnate being.‘The spirit has the upper hand in all this. He calls the shots. He wants hismeal left in a certain place at a certain time, and the rum and the cigar hadbetter be of good quality. Incarnate man is ready to oblige, and it isremarkable how many members of Brazil’s poorest classes, who are about as pooras anyone can be, will somehow manage to lay out a magnificent banquet for aspirit who has agreed to work some magic for them . . .‘Who are these spirits? Orthodox Kardecists and Umbandistas see them as inferiordiscarnates living in a low astral plane, who are close to the physical world,not having evolved since physical death . . . In Umbanda they are known as exús,spirits who seem to have no morals at all, and are equally prepared to work foror against people. Like Mafia gunmen, they do what the boss says without askingquestions.’He adds the interesting comment:‘The exú reminds us of the traditional spirits of the four elements: the gnomesof earth, the mermaids of water, the sylphs of air, and the salamanders of fire.These creatures are traditionally thought of as part human and part ‘elemental’,integral forces of nature that can act upon human beings subject to certainconditions. There is an enormous number of exús, each with his own speciality.To catch one and persuade him to work for you, it is necessary to bribe himoutright with food, drink and general flattery. An exú is a vain andtemperamental entity, and despite his total lack of morals he is very fussyabout observing the rituals properly.’All this sounds so much like the poltergeist that it is tempting to feel that wehave finally pinned down his true nature and character.Studying the background of the ‘Nora’ case—already described—Playfair foundstrong evidence that the poltergeist had been unleashed on the family by blackmagic. In 1968 an ‘offering’ of bottles, candles and cigars had appeared intheir garden, indicating that someone was working a trabalho against the family.Playfair lists the suspects. A former boyfriend of Iracy, the daughter, hadcommitted suicide; then there was an elderly aunt who had died abandoned by therest of the family, and may have borne a grudge. Then Iracy had had a loveaffair with a man who was (unknown to her) already married; the man’s wife couldhave organised the trabalho. Or it could possibly have been some formerdisgruntled lover of Nora, the girl who married the son of the family;photographs of Nora’s husband were frequently disfigured, and they found manynotes claiming that she was having an affair with another man.Playfair mentions that, at the time he was investigating the ‘Nora’ case,Andrade was studying one in the town of Osasco where there was definite evidencethat a poltergeist was caused by black magic. Two neighbouring families werehaving a lengthy dispute about boundaries, and one of the families ordered acurse against the other. The result was that the other family was haunted by apoltergeist that caused stones to fall on the roof, loud rapping noises, andspontaneous fires. One original feature of this case was that when the familywent to ladle a meal out of a saucepan—which had been covered with a lid—theyfound that the food had been spoiled by a large cigar.Candomblé—one of the bigger Afro-Brazilian cults—seems to have originated amongfreed negro slaves in the 1830s, and it has the same origin as voodoo, whichbegan in Haiti when the first slaves arrived early in the 17th century. This, inturn, originated in Africa as ju-ju. Europeans are naturally inclined to dismissthis as the outcome of ignorance and stupidity; but few who have had directexperience of it maintain that sceptical attitude.On the evening of September 9, 1977, Guy Playfair attended a lecture onpoltergeists at the Society for Psychical Research, and found himself sittingnext to a man named Maurice Grosse. After the lecture, Grosse announced that hewas in the middle of a case, and would be glad of some help. No one volunteered.A few days later, Playfair heard a broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in which MauriceGrosse described some of the amazing things that were happening in the house ofthe Harper family down at Enfield. Reluctantly—because he had just finished abook and was looking forward to a holiday—Playfair decided to offer some help.The Enfield poltergeist had put in its first appearance on the evening of August30, 1977. There were four children in the house: Rose, 13, Janet, 11, Pete, 10and Jimmy, 7; their mother was separated from her husband. Pete and Janet shareda bedroom. That evening, just after Pete and Janet had gone to bed, their bedsbegan to shake in an odd way. They called their mother, but the shaking hadstopped. She assumed they were ‘larking about’ and told them to get to sleep.The next evening, the children heard a shuffling noise, like a chair moving. MrsHarper came in and asked them to be quiet. The room all seemed to be perfectlynormal. But when she switched off the light, she also heard the shuffling noise.It sounded like someone shuffling across the room in slippers. Then there werefour loud, clear knocks. And when Mrs Harper put the light on again, she saw theheavy chest of drawers moving on its own. It slid a distance of about eighteeninches across the floor. She pushed it back. It slid back again. She tried topush it back, but it wouldn’t budge—it was as if someone was standing on theother side, preventing it from moving. Mrs Harper began to shake with fear. ‘Allright, downstairs everybody . . .’She went next door and asked the help of their neighbours. Vic Nottingham andhis son went back to the Harpers’ house, and searched it from top to bottom.Then the knocking started. Vic Nottingham rushed outside, to see if it was somepractical joker on the other side of the wall. There was no one there.They sent for the police. When the lights were switched off, the knockingstarted. Then, in the light from the kitchen, everyone saw a chair that waswobbling into motion. It slid towards the kitchen for three or four feet.The police could do nothing about ghosts, so they left. And the Harper familyslept in the living-room.The next day, all was quiet until evening. Then the poltergeist began throwingthings. Marbles and Lego bricks came zinging through the air as if shot from acatapult. When someone picked up one of the marbles, it was found to be burninghot.Wondering what to do, Mrs Harper allowed her neighbour to phone the DailyMirror. A reporter and photographer arrived, but saw nothing. They decided to goin the early hours of the morning. As soon as they were outside, the Legobombardment began again. Mrs Harper rushed out and told them. As thephotographer came in, his camera raised, a Lego brick flew across the room andhit him over the right eye. It caused quite a bruise—one of the few examples ofa poltergeist actually hurting someone. Yet the photograph showed no Lego brickflying towards him—it must have been just beyond the range of the camera. It waslater to occur to Guy Playfair that the poltergeist seemed to go to greattrouble not to be seen doing things.The Daily Mirror contacted the Society for Psychical Research, and the SPRcontacted Maurice Grosse, a recent member who was looking for a case toinvestigate. A few days later, Guy Playfair made his way down to the house inEnfield. It was the beginning of a two-year involvement.Playfair was inclined to suspect Janet, an extremely lively little girl. Heasked Mrs Harper to keep a special watch on her, adding: ‘Even if Janet isplaying tricks, it may not be her fault.’ For he had come across a curiousdiscovery made by earlier researchers like Nandor Fodor and William Roll: thatthe ‘focus’ of a poltergeist case may throw things—in the ordinary way—withoutbeing aware of it. The implication seems to be that a poltergeist can get insidesomeone and ‘make them do things’.While Playfair and a Mirror photographer waited in the dark in Janet’s bedroom,a marble landed with a bang on the floor. The odd thing was it did not roll, asa marble normally would. It stayed put. Playfair tried hard to duplicate this,but found it impossible; unless dropped from very close to the floor, a marblewill roll, particularly on smooth linoleum.When the photographer tried taking a test picture, all three flash-guns on allthree cameras failed to work. When he examined the guns, he found that they hadall been drained of power—although he had charged them a few minutes beforetrying to take the photograph.Playfair tried tying the leg of Janet’s bedside chair to the leg of her bed. Heused wire. Within minutes, the chair had fallen over; the wire had been snapped.He bound it with several twists of wire. Not long after, the chair fell overagain—the wire had snapped once more. A big armchair tipped over, then the bedshot across the room. A book flew off the shelf, hit the door, proceeded on atright angles, and landed upright on the floor; it was called Fun and Games forChildren. As they looked at one of the pillows on a bed, an indentation appearedon it, as if an invisible head was resting there. The head seemed to be a smallone, which led Mrs Harper to voice her suspicion that this was the ghost of a4-year-old girl who had been suffocated by her father in a nearby house; some ofthe furniture from the house has found its way into the Harper home, and MrsHarper had already thrown it out, suspecting it might be the cause of thetrouble. Clearly, she was mistaken.There came a point when Guy Playfair began to feel that the ‘entity’ wanted tocommunicate—it kept up its knocking on one occasion for two hours and a half. Amedium named Annie Shaw came to the house with her husband George. Annie wentinto a trance, then suddenly screamed, ‘Go away’, and began to cackle. When herhusband spoke to her, she spat at him. She moaned: ‘Gozer, Gozer, help me.Elvie, come here.’ George spoke firmly to the ‘entity’ that had taken over herbody, advising it to go away and leave the Harper family alone. When Anniereturned to normal, she stated that the haunting centred around Janet, and thatthere were several entities behind it, including an old woman. George added:‘This Gozer is a nasty piece of work, a sort of Black Magic chap. The other one,Elvie, is an elemental.’ Annie explained that the auric field around Janet andher mother was ‘leaking’, and that when this happens, poltergeists can use theenergy for their manifestations. The Shaws ‘cleaned’ their auras by a well-knowntechnique—moving their hands from head to foot around the contours of the body,about six inches away. The trouble, said the Shaws, was due to the negativeatmosphere in the house—and Mrs Harper admitted that she did feel bitter abouther ex-husband, and had been keeping the feeling bottled up for years. One wayof preventing a poltergeist from manifesting itself, said Annie Shaw, was tolearn to control one’s energies, so they stop ‘leaking’.For a few weeks after this healing session, the manifestations almost ceased.Then, in late October, they started up again—furniture flung around, bedsshaking, blankets ripped off beds—Playfair and Grosse recorded about fourhundred incidents in a brief space. Pools of water also began to appear on thekitchen floor—pools with very distinct outlines, as if made by pouring waterfrom a jug immediately on to the lino. One puddle was shaped like a humanfigure.The entity began doing things that could have caused serious damage. Oneevening, an iron grille from the bottom of a fireplace sailed across the roomand landed on Jimmy’s pillow—a little closer, and it could have killed him. Thenext evening, the heavy gas fire was ripped out of the wall—it had been cementedinto the brickwork. (Poltergeists can display frightening strength; in TheFlying Cow Playfair records a poltergeist that lifted a Jeep forty yards throughthe air.)On the advice of the veteran researcher E.J. Dingwall, Playfair triedcommunicating with the ‘entity’. When it rapped, he rapped back. When he askedit to use the usual code—one rap for yes, two for no—there followed a volley ofloud raps. Playfair asked: ‘Don’t you realise you are dead?’ which seemed toinfuriate it. Crashes came from a bedroom, and when they rushed up, the room wasin chaos, with objects scattered all over. Evidently ‘Gozer’ was not anxious tomake polite conversation.Maurice Grosse was more successful a few weeks later. ‘Did you die in thishouse?’ The rap-code indicated ‘Yes’. ‘Will you go away?’ A loud thud said ‘No’.The entity indicated that it had lived in the house for a long time—more thanthirty years. It had left fifty-three years ago. When the raps seemed to becomenonsensical, Grosse asked: ‘Are you having a game with me?’ A cardboard boxcontaining cushions flew across the room and struck Grosse on the forehead. GuyPlayfair, who was outside the door with his tape recorder (the poltergeist hadtaken a dislike to him), recorded all this on tape; the box made an odd swishingnoise. Yet no one actually saw the box flying across the room. It was as if ithad vanished from its old position, and rematerialised as it struck MauriceGrosse on the head.Like most poltergeists, this one was getting into its stride as it became moreskilled. The children began to see shadowy figures, and 7-year-old Jimmy wasterrified when he looked towards the wall, and saw a disembodied face—an oldman’s face with big white teeth—staring at him. In front of Grosse and severalother witnesses, it threw Janet off her chair, across the room, a distance ofeight feet. As Rose, the eldest girl, went upstairs, the ghost literally pulledher leg—the investigators found her standing on one leg, the other stretched outbehind her, unable to move. She was only able to walk when Grosse twisted hersideways.They decided to ask the ghost to write out a message, and left a pencil andpaper. A few minutes later, they found that someone had written: ‘I will stay inthis house. Do not show this to anyone else or I will retaliate.’ Anothermessage read: ‘Can I have a tea bag.’ Mrs Harper placed one on the table and, afew moments later, a second tea bag appeared beside it.When Mrs Harper’s husband came to call to pay his maintenance money, heexpressed disbelief in all this, and Mrs Harper showed him themessage—forgetting that it had ordered her not to. She said out loud: ‘I’msorry, I forgot.’ Another piece of paper appeared on the table: ‘Amisunderstanding. Don’t do it again.’A few days after this, the Society for Psychical Research sent a team ofinvestigators to look at the place. They had evidently decided that thepoltergeist activity was all due to the girls. Balloons full of water wereplaced under the beds for some reason; and, when they burst, water drippedthrough the ceiling. When the team had left, Grosse and Playfair—who had beenpresent—had some irritable things to say about the SPR’s obsession with fraud.By now it was very clear that Janet was the poltergeist’s main target. She wasoften thrown out of bed seven or eight times before she succeeded in getting tosleep. When she fell asleep, she twitched and moaned; Playfair began to feelincreasingly that she was ‘possessed’. He recalled the case of Maria Ferreira,the South American girl who had been driven to suicide by a poltergeist, andfelt some misgiving. On one occasion, with a photographer in the bedroom, Janetwas hurled out of bed—the event was photographed—and then, as the photographerand Maurice Grosse tried to hold her, she went into convulsions, screamedhysterically, and bit Grosse. When finally put back into bed, she fell asleep.Later, there was a crash, and they found her lying on top of the radio set,still fast asleep.The following night, Janet had more convulsions, and wandered around, talkingaloud, ‘Where’s Gober. He’ll kill you.’Two of Playfair’s friends from Brazil, who happened to be in London, called atthe Enfield house, and succeeded in bringing Janet out of one of her trance-likestates. Their view was that Janet was a powerful medium and ought to be trainedto use her powers. One of the two Brazilian mediums wrote on a sheet of paper:‘I see this child, Janet, in the Middle Ages, a cruel and wanton woman whocaused suffering to families of yeomen—some of these seem to have now to geteven with the family.’ Soon after this, Janet began producing drawings, in astate of semi-trance; one of them showed a woman with blood pouring out of herthroat, with the name ‘Watson’ written underneath. Other drawings continued thistheme of blood, knives and death. When Playfair asked Mrs Harper if she knew ofa Watson, she replied that it was the name of the previous tenants of the house.Mrs Watson had died of a tumour of the throat.Playfair asked Janet if she could bend a spoon like Uri Geller. He glanced awayfor a moment, as Mrs Harper spoke to him; when he looked back, the spoon wasbent in the middle—it was lying in the centre of the table. Janet said she hadexperienced a sudden feeling of headache as the spoon bent.In December 1977, the poltergeist began making noises—whistling and barkingsounds. Maurice Grosse decided to try asking it to speak. ‘Call out my name,Maurice Grosse.’ He went out of the room, and a strange voice said: ‘Maurice . .. O . . .’ Grosse asked it to say its own name. ‘Joe Watson.’ When Guy Playfairasked: ‘Do you know you are dead?’ the voice said angrily: ‘Shut up!’ And tofurther requests that it go away, it replied: ‘Fuck off.’ Joe seemed to beincapable of polite conversation. When another researcher, Anita Gregory, askedit questions, she was told to bugger off.The investigators wondered whether Janet could be simulating this voice,although it seemed unlikely; it was a masculine growl, and had an odd quality,as if electronically produced. (I have one of Guy Playfair’s tape recordings ofthe voice, and it reminds me strongly of a record I have of an electronic brainsinging ‘Daisy, Daisy’.) The voice would not speak if the investigators were inthe room. But their attempts were rewarded with long sentences. The voice nowidentified itself as Bill, and said it had a dog called Gober the Ghost. Askedwhy it kept shaking Janet’s bed it replied: ‘I was sleeping here.’ ‘Then why doyou keep on shaking it?’ ‘Get Janet out.’ Rose asked: ‘Why do you use badlanguage?’ ‘Fuck off you,’ replied Bill. And when Janet asked why it playedgames with them it replied: ‘I like annoying you.’ ‘Where do you come from?’‘From the graveyard.’ It even named the graveyard—Durant’s Park, which is in thearea.At Guy Playfair’s suggestion, Rose asked why it didn’t go away. ‘I don’t believein that.’ ‘Why? What’s so different about being up there?’ asked Rose, andreceived the wistful reply: ‘I’m not a heaven man.’ It went on to say in a jerkymanner: ‘I am Bill Haylock and I come from Durant’s Park and I am 72 years oldand I have come here to see my family but they are not here now.’On the tape, the words come out one by one, as if the speaker is so breathlessthat he can only get out one at a time. (The voice is so obviously that of anold man that the notion of Janet producing it by ventriloquism is absurd.)Rose’s next question is interrupted by a furious outburst: ‘You fucking oldbitch, shut up. I want some jazz music. Now go and get me some, else I’ll gobarmy.’Maurice Grosse’s son Richard paid a visit to the house and succeeded in holdinga lengthy conversation with the voice. When he asked it what it had done withthirty pence that had vanished it said it had hidden the money in theradio—which is where it was found. Asked how he had died, ‘Bill’ replied that hewent blind and had a haemorrhage—he fell asleep and died in a chair downstairs.Richard Grosse found that if he looked at Janet’s face while the voice wasspeaking, it would stop. If he thought of looking round, the voice would alsostop, as if reading his mind.Another researcher named David Robertson had no difficulty getting the voice totalk, although the main thing it wanted to discuss was girls’ periods. Then theghost was asked to levitate Janet, and then draw a line round the light on theceiling. Robertson withdrew outside, and heard Janet being bounced up and downon the bed. Suddenly there was a gasp and silence. He tried to open the door andfound that it was jammed tight. When it opened again, Janet was on the bed andthere was a red line around the light. Janet claimed that she had floatedthrough the wall, into the bedroom of the next house—belonging to PeggyNottingham (who was with David Robertson at the time). She described it as ‘allwhite’—a fairly accurate description of the light wallpaper. Peggy asked her totry doing it again, and went next door to see what happened. Janet was notthere. But on the floor, there was the book Fun and Games for Children, whichhad been on the mantelpiece in Janet’s bedroom a few minutes earlier.Robertson handed a red plastic cushion to Janet and said: ‘See what you can dowith that.’ ‘All right, David boy,’ said the invisible entity—which seemed tolike Robertson—‘I’ll make it disappear.’ Robertson went out of the room, andthere was a cry from Janet. When he went back, the cushion had vanished; thewindow was tightly shut. But a neighbour who was passing the house at thatmoment suddenly saw a red cushion appear on the roof. Another neighbour latertestified that she had also seen the cushion as she walked past. And, looking atJanet’s bedroom window, she had seen books and cushions striking the window, andJanet rising into the air—in a horizontal position—and descending again, as ifbeing bounced on a trampoline. ‘She was definitely lying horizontal, coming upand down.’ Guy Playfair tried bouncing on Janet’s bed, and found that no matterhow hard he bounced, it was impossible to get up into the air.Playfair was struck by Janet’s comment that when she had floated through thewall into Peggy’s bedroom, it was ‘all white’ and there were no colours. Hearrived at the conclusion that what had happened was that Janet had had an ‘outof the body’ experience—other astral travellers have observed the lack of colourduring ‘OOBs’. But this fails to explain how the book also passed through thewall.Was there, Playfair asked himself at this point, any more the poltergeist coulddo to demonstrate its versatility? In fact, it went on to produce a wholevariety of new phenomena. It became rather more violent with Janet, making anattempt to suffocate her with the curtains, and making a knife follow her aroundin the air. (The voice claimed that this was the doing of another entity calledTommy.) It produced a biscuit out of nowhere and stuck it into Janet’s mouth. Itput butter and cheese on a piece of bread. (When Guy Playfair tried to touch itthe voice rasped, ‘Leave it alone.’) It smeared ordure around the place. Itbegan causing fires in closed drawers—fires which, fortunately, extinguishedthemselves. It produced some appalling stinks, like rotten cabbages. After avisit from the psychic Matthew Manning, it began scrawling obscene messages onthe kitchen walls. When the two pet goldfish died, the ‘voice’ claimed it hadelectrocuted them by accident (which, if true, seems to confirm thatpoltergeists use some form of electrical energy).A medium called Gerry Sherrick told the Harpers that they had all been togetherin a previous existence, and that the girls had dabbled in witchcraft. He alsotold them he felt that a nasty old woman was connected with the ‘haunting’, andthat she had lived near Spitalfields market. Had there been any smells likerotten vegetables? After this, he went into a trance, and an old woman’s voiceannounced: ‘I come here when I like . . . I’m not bleedin’ dead, and I’m notgoing to go away.’ Sherrick performed ‘psychic healing’ on the family—to healthe ‘leaks’ that were causing the trouble. After his visit, the Enfield housebecame quiet for several weeks, as it had after the two previous visits bymediums.The case was beginning to turn into something more like a normal haunting. MrsHarper saw an apparition of a pair of legs in blue trousers going upstairs, andalso saw a child. The children continued to see old men. A neighbour who waslooking after the house when the Harpers went to the seaside saw a man in hisshirtsleeves sitting at the table. Another neighbour knocked on the front door,and through the window saw Maurice Grosse in the hall, then watched him goupstairs. When finally admitted, she discovered that Maurice Grosse had been inthe upper part of the house for the past half hour or so. The poltergeist was‘imitating’ him.In mid-1978, Janet went into the Maudsley Hospital for observation and testing.Playfair expected the disturbances in Enfield to cease while she was away; infact, they continued, although on a smaller scale. And Janet claimed that anumber of small poltergeist incidents happened to her while in hospital. ButJanet’s spell in the Maudsley—which made her healthier and stronger—was thebeginning of the end of the Enfield case.The haunting seems to have been brought to an end by a Dutch clairvoyant namedDono Gmelig-Meyling, who was brought to the house by a Dutch journalist whowanted to study the case. The day before their first visit had beeneventful—overturned furniture, knocks, footsteps, sounds of breathing, andexcrement smeared on the floor. Dono spent some time in the house, then returnedto his hotel. There, he later told Playfair, he went on an ‘astral trip’, andmet a 24-year-old girl who was somehow involved with the case. This was aninteresting new departure. Later, Dono met Maurice Grosse, and again had astrong sense that he was somehow connected with the haunting—and not purely asan investigator. When Grosse mentioned that his own daughter had been killed ina motor-cycle accident two years before—she would have been 24 if stillalive—Dono said: ‘Well that’s it. It’s your daughter . . .’ There was nosuggestion that she was responsible for any of the poltergeist activity, onlythat she was somehow connected. In the final chapter of his account of theEnfield case, This House is Haunted, Playfair tries to draw together hisspeculations about the disturbances. His suggestion is that Maurice Grosse’sdaughter—whose name was also Janet—was involved indirectly. It was she who haddrawn her father’s attention to the case. Janet had died after a motor-cyclecrash in 1976, and Grosse had been impressed by a series of odd events andcoincidences. A birthday card she had sent to her brother just before theaccident showed someone with her head swathed in bandages, and an inscriptionabout falling on it. Janet had died of head injuries. Grosse found himselfwondering if Janet was somehow still alive, and thought that a suitable signwould be some rain—there had been a drought for months. The next morning, thekitchen roof below Janet’s bedroom window was wet, although everywhere else wasdry. It had been because of Janet’s death that Grosse had thought about engagingin active psychical research, and his first case had been the Enfield haunting.Playfair speculates that it was Janet who had somehow put it into theneighbour’s head to ring the Daily Mirror, and who put it into the journalist’shead to ring the SPR. So her father became involved in investigating a case thatcentred around another Janet. (Kardec claims that spirits often influence ourthoughts.)As to how the poltergeist haunting came about in the first place, Playfair’sspeculation is as follows:‘When Mr and Mrs Harper were divorced, an atmosphere of tension built up amongthe children and their mother, just at the time when the two girls wereapproaching physical maturity. They were a very energetic pair to start with,both of them school sports champions, but even they could not use up thetremendous energy they were generating. So a number of entities came in andhelped themselves to it.’As to the identity of the ‘entities’: ‘It looks as if we had half the localgraveyard at one time or another.’ These included Joe Watson, husband of thewoman who had died of a cancer of the throat, and Bill Haylock, later identifiedas a former local resident. There could well have been a dozen entitiesaltogether, and they were able to take energy from practically everyone in thehouse. (Mrs Harper experienced premonitory headaches before things happened, andwhile Janet was in hospital, the youngest boy, Jimmy, began having trances.) TheDutch clairvoyant Dono Gmelig-Meyling stated confidently that he would be ableto put an end to the haunting (by some kind of intervention ‘on the astralplane’), and it is a fact that his visits marked the end of the Enfield case.And why did so many entities invade the Harper residence? The answer, Playfairbelieves, may be provided by Kardec, who states that many dead people are quiteunaware that they are dead. In The Flying Cow he cites the interestingRuytemberg Rocha case in support of this view. In November 1961, a spiritistgroup in São Paulo found themselves listening to a voice—coming through themedium—which identified itself as Ruytemberg Rocha, a pupil in the second yearof the Officers’ School of the São Paulo State Police. The voice gave details ofits family and date of birth, and added that it was wounded by shrapnel in therevolution in 1932. When Dr Carvalho—in charge of the session—said that this wasnow 1961, the spirit was astonished, and said that that was impossible. Carvalhoassured him that he was dead, and that they would do all they could to help him.It was an excellent case for verification, since the spirit had given so manydetails about himself and his family. A little research revealed that it allchecked out—the family, the officer school, the battle in which he had died. Oneminor discrepancy was that Rocha had been killed by a bullet through the head,while the spirit spoke only about a shrapnel wound in the chest. But a bullet inthe brain could have stimulated the chest area, giving him the impression thatthis was where he was wounded. According to Kardec, the state of confusionhappens mostly in cases of sudden death, and may last for anything from hours toyears. In the Enfield case, we have seen how angry the ‘entity’ became whenPlayfair declared that it was dead, and how the quarrelsome old woman asserted‘I’m not bleedin’ dead.’Yet, as usual in poltergeist cases, it is practically impossible to get at thetruth. The spirits themselves seldom seem to have any interest in the truth. Inthe present case, there are intriguing hints about a man called Gozer or Goberwho practised black magic, and about the involvement of Janet and Rose inwitchcraft in a previous existence. There was a former resident of the housecalled Joe Watson, who did die in the house much as described by Janet’s bassvoice and whose wife did die of throat cancer, and there was a former neighbourcalled Bill Haylock. All of which adds at least a semblance of logic and reasonto one of the best-authenticated poltergeist cases on record.Perhaps the last word should go to a medium—and police commissioner—called DrRafael Ranieri, quoted by Playfair in The Flying Cow:‘A medium is an open door to the invisible world. What comes through that doordepends to a large extent upon the personality of the medium, and it is quitewrong to suppose that the spirit world consists entirely of angelic beingsdevoted to our welfare. There are plenty of evil spirits around, also others whoseem to have nothing better to do than fool about and amuse themselves at ourexpense by such elementary . . . parlour tricks as lifting up tables andthrowing things around the room. This would seem to be the level of spirit mostoften to be found at some of the widely publicised seances, and those who findspirit communications trivial, as many are, should blame the mediums, not thespirits.’If Janet and other members of the Harper family are unconscious mediums, perhapsit is hardly surprising that the entities who make use of their energies shouldbelong to a fairly low level of the spirit hierarchy."},{"pageContent":"10The Power of the WitchTHE MOST UNEXPECTED bestseller of 1926 was a book called The History ofWitchcraft and Demonology by the Rev. Montague Summers. Issued by Routledge andKegan Paul as part of their History of Civilisation, it was an obviously seriouswork, full of Latin quotations, lengthy footnotes, and a comprehensivebibliography. What startled the reviewers was that the author clearly believedevery word he wrote about the ‘enormous wickedness’ of witches, warlocks anddevil worshippers. H. G. Wells was so incensed by the book that he launched avituperative attack on it in the Sunday Express. The Times, equallydisapproving, contented itself with the comment that ‘the more Mr Summers givesproof of general ability, of scholarship and of wide reading, the more thesuspicion deepens that a mystification is in progress and that he is amusinghimself at our expense’.Was it a legpull? Or a cynical attempt to achieve a succès de scandale?Apparently neither. The Reverend Montague Summers was a respectable Catholicscholar, editor of several Restoration dramatists, and founder of a theatricalsociety called the Phoenix, which revived Restoration plays on the London stage.It is true that his name was not to be found in the clergy lists of either theRoman Catholic Church or the Church of England; but this was not—as rumour hadit—because he was an unfrocked priest; in fact he had been ordained a Deacon ofthe Church of England in 1908, a year before he became a Roman Catholic convert.It is also true that he allowed people to suppose that he was a Roman Catholicpriest, and used to say Mass in his own private oratory, in spite of the factthat he had been rejected as a Candidate for the priesthood by his superiors.The gusto with which he recounts sexual details of the satanic rites—even thoughmost of them are decently clothed in Latin—may suggest why his superiors hadfound him unsuitable. In spite of these foibles, Summers was a genuine scholar.And the views he expressed were the views held by the Roman Catholic Church inhis own day—as they still are.What is the truth about witchcraft?Between 1275 and 1692, thousands of men and women were tortured and burnt todeath in Europe, accused of worshipping the Devil, and having intercourse withspirits and demons.The first known victim was a 60-year-old woman called Angéle de la Barthe, whowas accused of having had sexual intercourse with a demon, and given birth to amonster. This creature had to be fed on the flesh of dead babies, so—accordingto the accusation—Angéle either murdered children, or dug up their corpses fromgraveyards. Tried before the Inquisitor Hugues de Baniols at Toulouse, she wassentenced to be burned to death.It is natural for us to feel outrage at such appalling inhumanity, and toconclude that the evidence against Angéle amounted to the grossest superstition.Yet the last chapter suggests another possibility. If the umbanda magicians ofBrazil are capable of ‘using’ spirits to cause mischief—even to wreck houses—howcan we be certain that at least a few of the witches of the Middle Ages were notguilty as charged?Before we attempt to answer that question, let us look briefly at the history ofthe ‘witchcraft craze’.The first thing we have to understand is that witches are as old as history, andthat they were not sinister old ladies who dabbled in black magic, butpriestesses whose business was to aid the hunters of the tribe in their searchfor game, and later, to ensure a good harvest. (We call male witches shamans.)They were servants of the moon goddess, known in Egypt as Isis, in Greece asSelene, and in Rome as Diana. Early witches were beautiful enchantresses, likeHomer’s Circe, who turned men into swine, or Theocritus’s Samaetha, who performsa magical ceremony to bring back her faithless lover. It was only in later yearsthat the image of the witch changed to the horrible old crone who digs upcorpses or raises the spirits of the dead—like the Witch of Endor in the Bible.On the whole, witches were regarded as useful—if rather frightening—members ofsociety.Then why does the Bible say: ‘Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live’? Because asthe old Nature religion disappeared, to be replaced by religions like Judaismand Christianity, the witch was regarded with increasing dislike and suspicion.She was a remnant of mankind’s dark past, and everyone wanted to forget her.It was another Christian invention, the Devil, that made the witch an object ofsuperstitious terror. The Satan of the Old Testament—like the Book of Job—was asatan, the Hebrew word meaning an adversary or obstructor—in other words, a kindof demon, but not the Prince of Darkness. The Christian Devil can be traced backto St Paul, who invented the idea that Jesus had died to save man from the sinof Adam (a claim Jesus himself never made), and that Adam fell because Eve wastempted by the Devil in the form of a serpent. (There is no suggestion in theOld Testament that the serpent was anything but an ordinary snake.)In the hands of the early Church Fathers, Christianity became a grim religion,obsessed by sin and evil—and, of course, by the Devil. When the EmperorConstantine made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire in 313AD, Christians immediately began to torture and burn one another—the aim beingto stamp out ‘heresy’. But as the Church became increasingly successful, it alsobecame—inevitably—increasingly corrupt. Reformers who felt the Church wasgrowing too fat and self-indulgent now became the Enemy, servants of the Devil.The Cathars, for example, (the name means ‘pure ones’) wanted to respiritualiseChristianity. The Church of Rome declared a crusade against them in 1208, andthousands of Cathars were slaughtered in France, particularly in the area ofToulouse (where 20,000 were burned or put to the sword). The few survivorswithdrew to remote mountain villages, where they continued to practise theirreligion. They were known under various names (Albigenses, Waldenses, Bogomils),but as far as the Church was concerned, they were all Devil-worshippers. Theybecame known as ‘witches’. And Angéle de la Barthe, whom we have met, wasaccused of being one of them. She was tried—and burned—for heresy, not forwitchcraft.A century after the slaughter of the Cathars, witchcraft—or rather, blackmagic—was again used as an excuse to commit murder on a massive scale. Thevictims this time were an order of knights called the Knight Templars. They hadbeen founded in the Holy Land after the First Crusade—in 1118—to protectChristian pilgrims trying to get to Jerusalem, and they became immensely rich.By 1303 they had been driven out of the Holy Land, and took refuge in Cyprus,but large numbers lived in France. King Philip IV of France—known as theFair—often borrowed money from them, and dreamed of laying his hands on theirwealth. The excuse he chose was to accuse them of Devil-worship andhomosexuality. At daybreak on October 13, 1307, the authorities swooped onTemplars all over France and arrested them. At their trial, the judges were toldthat in order to become a Templar, a man had to become a sodomite, and kiss themouth, navel and anus of his sponsor; they also had to swear allegiance to thedemon Baphomet. Under horrible tortures, many confessed. In 1310, 54 were burnedto death—all refusing to confess. Jacques de Molay, the Grand Master of theorder, was one who confessed, and was sentenced to life imprisonment; but whenexposed in public to repeat his confession to the populace, he declared that hehad been made to confess under torture, and that the order was innocent. He wasburned alive on a slow fire. His last words were to summon the king and pope tomeet him before God’s throne within a year; in fact, both died within that time.The persecution of witches started off slowly. It was more than a century afterthe death of Angéle de la Barthe that a woman was first tried as a witch—thatis, for black magic rather than heresy. Her name was Jehanne de Brigue, and theinteresting thing about the case is that she probably was a witch. In 1390, shewas accused in Paris by a man called Jehane de Ruilly, who had become convincedthat he had been ‘hexed’ (or bewitched) by his ex-mistress Gilete, who had bornehim two children. Her spells had brought him close to death, but Jehanne deBrigue had saved him by making a waxen figure of Gilete and suckling two toads,(i.e. placing their open mouths over her nipples.) It is not clear why Ruillydecided to accuse her of witchcraft when she had saved his life. Jehanne atfirst denied being a witch, but, after three months in prison, admitted that shehad learned witchcraft from her aunt, and that she performed her sorceries withthe aid of a demon named Haussibut.She was sentenced to death, but given a temporary reprieve because she waspregnant. She decided to appeal to the Parlement of Paris, but this proved to bea mistake, for the Parlement suggested she should be put to the torture.Hereupon, Jehanne confessed that the whole affair had been inspired by Ruilly’swife Macette, to get revenge on him for beating her; Jehanne had concocted a‘philtre’ to poison him, and also made a waxen image.Macette was arrested and tortured until she confessed; then both women wereburned to death.Our natural inclination is to believe that they were victims of mediaevalsuperstition. And indeed, there is no real evidence against Macette. But Jeannehad already been jailed in Meaux as a witch before her arrest in Paris. Thereseems little doubt that she believed she was a witch, and believed that sheperformed her magic with the aid of a demon.The first ‘epidemic’ of witchcraft took place seventy years later in Arras, innorthern France, and soon came to an end because common-sense prevailed—aweak-minded woman named Deniselle Grenoieres was burned alive, together withfour accomplices she had named under torture; but the Archbishop of Rheimsdeclared that the whole thing was a delusion, and the Parlement of Paris orderedthe release of more suspects in 1460. But this tendency to regard witchcraft asa delusion worried Pope Innocent, and in 1484 he issued a papal bull denouncingwitchcraft.But the witchcraft persecutions that led to so much misery during the next twocenturies were actually caused by an invention that would later cause the Churchendless trouble: printing (invented by Gutenberg around 1440). For in 1486 thereappeared a work that was directly inspired by the witch-obsessed pope, theMalleus Maleficarum, or Hammer of Witches, by Jacob Sprenger and HeinrichKramer. Its description of the sexual antics of witches undoubtedly explain itswide popularity—it described how witches have intercourse with demons (orincubi), and how male witches enjoy female demons, or succubi, but it was theinvention of printing that turned it into a bestseller in many languages. As faras the Church was concerned, printing was a dubious blessing, since it enabledpeople to read the Bible for themselves—and so undermined the authority of thepriests—and enabled Martin Luther’s denunciations of Rome (posted on the churchdoor in Wittenberg in 1517) to be read all over Europe . . .Even so, the persecutions got off to a slow start. In Toulouse (the old centreof the Cathar heresy) 40 witches were burned in 1557. Six years later, Englandpassed a witchcraft bill under Queen Elizabeth. And in 1566, and again in 1582and 1587, there were witchcraft trials at Chelmsford, in Essex, the first two ofwhich resulted in two hangings, and the third in four.But by that time in Germany, the great witchcraft craze was well under way. InTreves, five women were burned as witches in 1572, but this was only a preludeto the trials that began in 1582. By then, the harvest had been poor for severalyears, and witches were blamed. (Such troubles often seem to cause witchpersecutions: a hundred years later, Massachusetts was having all kinds ofpolitical problems when the Salem ‘witch scare’ helped to release the sense ofoppression and helplessness.) Between 1587 and 1594, 306 persons were accused ofbeing witches, and they involved another 6,000 people in their confessions asaccomplices. In his History of Treves Johan Linden, canon of the cathedral,notes: ‘Scarcely any of those who were accused escaped punishment’. DietrichFlade, Vice-Governor of Treves and Rector of the university, objected that manyof the trials were illegal, and was himself accused as a witch and burned.Franz Buirmann was a German equivalent of the English ‘witch-finder’ MatthewHopkins; but there were many like him, and his career has survived only becauseHermann Löher, a humanitarian court official who was forced to flee to Holland,wrote about his personal knowledge of Buirmann in a book published many yearslater. Löher lived at Rheinbach, near Bonn, a quiet village that had littlecrime. Buirmann, described as a ‘shrewd man of low birth’, had been appointeditinerant judge and witch-hunter by the Archbishop of Cologne; he was able toclaim the property of those he condemned as witches, and, as a consequence,became affluent. In 1631 and 1636 he paid two visits to Rheinbach and two nearbyvillages, and burned 150 people out of 300 households. In further persecutionsat Siegburg later the same year, Buirmann even had the executioner burned as awitch.The German witch persecutions occurred mainly in towns that remained Catholic(like Treves). Other such areas were Strasbourg, Breslau, Fulda, Würzburg andBamberg. Würzburg and Bamberg were ruled by cousins, one of whom burned 900people, the other 600. In Bamberg, the witch burning began around 1609, underBishop von Aschhausen, who in thirteen years burned 300 witches. In anotherseries of trials between 1626 and 1630, 400 people were burned. When theVice-Chancellor tried stopping the trials, he was accused as a witch andexecuted with his wife and daughter. (The Prince-Archbishop ignored an orderfrom the Emperor ordering their release.) But the Bamberg trials stopped asabruptly as they had started, in 1630, partly because of the invasion of Leipzigby the Swedish King Gustavus, which gave the instigators of the trials otherthings to think about, partly because of the continued opposition of theEmperor.In Würzburg in 1629, the Chancellor described in a letter how he had seen manychildren executed for intercourse with the devil—their ages ranging from threeto fifteen. He adds that it is ‘beyond doubt that in a place called the FrawRengberg the Devil in person with 8,000 of his followers held an assembly andcelebrated a black mass’. In 1629 there were 29 executions totalling 157persons, many of them children. The Prince-Bishop even had his sole heir, ayouth, beheaded as a witch. After this execution, the Prince-Bishop seems tohave experienced a change of heart, and instituted commemorative services forthe victims. Here, as in Bamberg, the Inquisitors and witch-finders wereJesuits. Prince-Bishop Philip Adolf, the man responsible for all these deaths,is described by one historian as ‘otherwise noble and pious’.Yet there were waves of revulsion and resistance to all the torture and murder.In 1663, a magistrate and ‘witch-finder’ named Geiss, who had been torturing andburning the citizens of Lindheim for two years, turned his attention to awealthy miller named Johann Schüler. (Here, as in so many other cases, the basicmotive was undoubtedly financial.) Schüler’s wife had borne a stillborn childthe previous year, and Geiss forced the midwife to ‘confess’ that they hadmurdered the child and used the body for witchcraft. The child’s body wasexhumed and found to be intact (the midwife alleged it had been cut up), and themidwife and six people she had implicated were burned. Not long after, Geisspersuaded another suspected witch—through torture—to implicate Frau Schüler, whowas arrested: an old scar was declared to be a ‘devil mark’. Schüler hastened toWürzburg to try to persuade the Dean of the Cathedral to help, but in hisabsence, Frau Schüler was tortured into confession. On his return, Schüler wasthrown into the ‘witch’s tower’ and then tortured into confessing. However, assoon as the torture stopped, he recanted. He was tortured again; again heconfessed and recanted. Geiss was preparing to torture him a third time whenangry townspeople rioted, and Schüler and other suspected witches managed toescape. They succeeded in getting to Speyer, the seat of the Supreme Court,where the sight of their tortured and scarred bodies—particularly thewomen—aroused indignation. But in Schüler’s absence, and in spite of popularanger, Geiss burnt Frau Schüler alive. The townspeople rose up in force, andGeiss and his men had to flee. The Dean of Würzburg suggested to BaronOynhausen—responsible for Geiss’s appointment—that he ought to assuage thepopular fury by censuring Geiss, and Oynhausen dismissed him, to Geiss’sindignation—he insisted that he had only been doing his duty.The Protestant states executed less witches, and ceased the witchcraftpersecutions earlier than Catholic states; in Prussia, King Frederick Williamput a stop to witch trials in 1714. The last execution for witchcraft in Germanytook place in 1775.Why were the witch trials so widespread in Germany—more than in any othercountry? Rossell Hope Robbins, the highly sceptical author of An Encyclopedia ofWitchcraft and Demonology, comments: ‘Germany was the land of torture . . .’ andcites a case in Tettwang, near Constance, in 1608, when a father died in prisonfrom torture, his wife was hoisted in the strappado 11 times (a device fordislocating the shoulders), and their 29-year-old daughter was also hoisted 11times with a 50 pound weight attached to her legs. The torturer allowed her torecover for ten weeks before subjecting her to more torture—not out of mercy,but because he was afraid she would die under it.The case of Buirmann and Geiss makes it obvious that many of the ‘witch-finders’were sexual sadists, for whom the persecutions were an opportunity to give freerein to their impulses. (Criminologists have noted that Germany has a higherpercentage of mass murders and sadistic murders than any other country—althoughin the past few decades America is beginning to catch up.) The rise ofProtestantism in Germany also seems to explain a great deal (although somecities that persecuted witches—like Leipzig—were Protestant) as the CatholicChurch struggled to regain its authority through a reign of terror.Again, our horror at the appalling cruelty tends to blind us to the importantquestion of whether any of the thousands of witches who were burned were genuinepractitioners of magic—in the sense of the umbanda magicians described in thelast chapter. But a case that occurred in North Berwick, in Scotland, in the1590s raises that question all over again.What happened was this. A young maidservant named Gilly Duncan was able to curevarious ailments by some form of faith healing. In 1590 her master David Seaton,deputy bailiff of Tranent, near Edinburgh, tortured her with a rope around herneck to make her ‘confess’ to intercourse with the devil, which eventually shedid. She was handed over to the authorities, and soon confessed that heraccomplices—about 70 in number—included many highly respectable citizens ofEdinburgh, amongst them one Agnes Sampson, an elderly gentlewoman of goodeducation. Under prolonged torture, Agnes Sampson finally confessed—although notuntil her inquisitors found on her a ‘devil’s mark’ in the area of her vagina.John Fian, a schoolmaster from Saltpans, and two other women, Euphemia Macleanand Barbara Napier, ‘reputed for as civil, honest women as any that dwelledwithin the city of Edinburgh’, were also accused. Agnes Sampson now gave a fullaccount of her attempts to bewitch the king—James VI of Scotland (later James Iof England)—who, understandably, took an active interest in the proceedings.Fian confessed under torture, but later managed to escape; when recaptured, herecanted his confession, and the most appalling tortures failed to make himchange his mind. He was strangled and burned. Euphemia Maclean was burnedwithout being first strangled—probably because she was a Catholic—but BarbaraNapier managed to get her sentence delayed on the grounds that she was pregnant,and finally escaped.Certainly, this sounds like a case of horrifying injustice. James the First, whowrote a famous Dœmonologie, later decided that most witchcraft was superstition,and persecution of witches almost ceased towards the end of his reign.Fuller examination of the case raises doubts about their innocence. John Fianhad been secretary to the Earl of Bothwell, a man with a reputation for dabblingin black magic, and who had every reason for wanting to kill the king, since hehimself was heir to the throne. James was himself sceptical about the confessionof Agnes Sampson until—according to the chronicle Newes from Scotland—she tookhim aside and whispered in his ear certain words that had passed between him andhis bride, Anne of Denmark, on their wedding night. No one but the king and hisbride knew what they were. Naturally, James was convinced.Agnes Sampson also confessed that she and the others had raised a storm toattempt to drown the King on his way back from Denmark—and indeed, the king hadalmost been drowned in a tremendous storm. She described how she had tied a toadby its back legs, collected the venom that dripped from it in an oyster-shell,and kept it until some occasion when she could get hold of some of the king’ssoiled linen, which would enable her to bewitch him to death, making him feel‘as if he had been lying upon sharp thorns and ends of needles . . .’ The methodis reminiscent of the one still used by African witch-doctors.Fian himself seems to have declared that the devil appeared to him in his cellon the night after his original confession. Since he had already confessed, hewas not under the threat of torture, which again leads to the suspicion that hemay not have been as innocent as Robbins assumes.Montague Summers is, of course, convinced that the witches were guilty ascharged. He writes: ‘The most celebrated occasion when witches raised a stormwas that which played so important a part in the trial of Dr Fian and his coven,1590–91, when the witches, in order to drown King James and Queen Anne on theirvoyage from Denmark, ‘took a cat and christened it,’ and after they had bound adismembered corpse to the animal ‘in the night following the said cat wasconvayed into the middest of the sea by all these witches, sayling in theirriddles or cives . . . this donne, then did arise such a tempest in the sea, asa greater hath not bene seene’.’ It all sounds preposterous enough, particularly‘sailing in sieves’; but if African witch-doctors can cause rain—or (see p. 304[../Text/15_chapter10.html#page_304])—then Summers could well be basicallycorrect. There is at least a fifty per cent possibility that Fian was involvedin a real witchcraft plot to kill the king; and if witchcraft sometimes works,then we cannot rule out the possibility that Agnes Sampson and her associatesreally caused the storm which almost wrecked the king’s ship.And what of this statement of Fian that the Devil appeared to him? This wouldseem to brand the confession an invention wrung from him by fear of furthertorture. Yet again, we should not assume that this is the only possibleexplanation. As we have seen, in his book about magic and witchcraft in BrazilThe Flying Cow, Guy Playfair advances the theory that he himself has come toaccept through the study of many cases that ‘black magic’ involves the conjuringof ‘low grade’ entities or spirits. And this is, of course, consistent with theview of magic held by witch-doctors and shamans. If we are willing to admit, asa possibility, that magic involves non-human entities, then Fian may havebelieved that he saw—or heard—the Devil on the night after his confession. Wemay reject Summers’ view that the Devil actually exists as the adversary ofGod—after all, most of what we call evil can be regarded as stupidity or theoutcome of frustration—but there is a certain amount of evidence in psychicalresearch for ‘mischievous’ entities (who, in many cases, seem to behalf-witted). ‘Evil’ spirits may be exhibiting the same kind of stupidity andmalevolence as evil human beings.The same disturbing questions are raised by the extraordinary case of IsobelGowdie and the Auldearne witches, which took place in Scotland in 1662.Isobel Gowdie was an attractive, red-headed girl who married a farmer ofLochloy, near Auldearne in Morayshire. She was childless and her husband is saidto have been a stupid and boorish man. In April 1662, she startled and shockedthe elders of the local kirk when she announced that she had been a practisingwitch for the past fifteen years, had attended Sabbats, had sexual intercoursewith the Devil and even killed people by witchcraft. She was tried at Auldearne,near Inverness, in the summer of 1662, together with others she had mentioned inher confession. Astonishingly enough, some of these confirmed what she said indetail.According to Isobel—who made four confessions between April and her trial—sheencountered the Devil, a man dressed in grey, when she was travelling betweentwo farms, and she seems to have promised herself to him and agreed to meet himat the church in Auldearne. She did so, and the Devil stood in the pulpit with ablack book in his hand, and made her renounce Jesus. A woman called MargaretBrodie held her while the Devil sucked blood from her shoulder, making a Devil’smark, and baptised her. She described the Devil as a big, black, hairy man, whocame to her a few days later and copulated with her. He would copulate freelywith all the female witches, who thoroughly enjoyed it. (Another of the accused,Janet Breadhead, described how the women sat on either side of the Devil at ameeting, and next, how the Devil copulated with all of them—which, unless he wasphenomenally potent, seems to dispose of Margaret Murray’s belief that he was aman dressed in a goat skin.) Sometimes the Devil changed himself to ananimal—such as a deer or bull—before he copulated. It was Isobel who first usedthe word ‘coven’ of a group of witches, and declared that the number was 13. Shesaid that each member had a spirit to wait upon her, (or him—there seem to havebeen male members). They had a Grand Meeting four times a year.The confessions become wilder and stranger. She flew to Sabbats on a littlehorse. The witches could change themselves into any shape they wished, such as acat, a hare, a crow. They would blast people’s harvests and kill theirchildren—Janet Breadhead says they made clay images of children, which werecontinually watered and baked until the child died; in this way, she says, theykilled two children of the local laird, who was himself later bewitched todeath. Isobel Gowdie says she killed several people using arrows given to her bythe Devil, She also described a visit to fairyland, when the Downie Hill opened,and they were all generously fed by the Queen of Faery, who was clothed in whitelinen. Afterwards they went shooting with the Devil; Isobel shot a woman, andthe others brought down a ploughman.It is a pity that no trial records have been found, so we have no idea ofwhether the witches were all sentenced to be burned—most commentators feelreasonably certain that they were, and, given the verdicts in similar trials atthe time, this seems highly likely.The mystery remains. The whole thing could not have been Isobel’s fantasy, orthe others would not have confirmed what she said (no mention of torture ismade). And so we seem to be left with only two possibilities: either that Isobeland her fellow witches were insane, or that the various ‘demons’ were as genuineas the ‘spirits’ conjured up by modern umbanda magicians.By the second half of the 17th century, the witchcraft craze was coming to anend. In Germany, this was largely due to the influence of Protestantism, and itsreaction against the kind of ‘popish’ hysteria that had fuelled the greatpersecutions of the previous century. In England and America, ordinarycommonsense finally prevailed.The career of Matthew Hopkins had the effect of virtually ending the witchcraftpersecution in England. Even the Rev. Montague Summers admits that hisinsincerity ‘made his name stink in men’s nostrils’, and described him as ‘thefoulest of foul parasites, an obscene bird of prey . . .’The career of Hopkins snowballed from his first denunciation of a witch in 1644.Hopkins was a not-particularly-successful lawyer, son of a clergyman, who movedto the small village of Manningtree in Essex because he was unable to make aliving in Ipswich. It was during the Civil War, East Anglia was on Cromwell’sside, but tensions were considerable. In March 1644, Hopkins became convincedthat there were witches who lived in Manningtree, and that they held meetingsclose to his house. He may possibly have been correct—country areas are full ofwitches. Hopkins decided that an old woman named Elizabeth Clarke was involved,and denounced her. She was arrested and stripped, to be searched for devil’smarks. They discovered, apparently, something like a supernumerary teat. Afterbeing deprived of sleep for days, she confessed to suckling her familiars withit—a spaniel, a rabbit, a greyhound and a polecat. The witch fever spreadthrough the village, and five other women were arrested. Four of these confessedreadily to possessing familiars. Thirty-two women were eventually thrown intojail, where four of them died. Twenty-eight stood trial in a special court atChelmsford. Hopkins now had four assistants to help him in routing out witches,and no doubt this taste of power convinced him that he had discovered the roadto fame and success. But it seems fairly certain that he was willing to perjurehimself freely from the beginning—he asserted in court that he had seenElizabeth Clarke’s familiars, and his assistants backed him up. Nineteen womenwere hanged, on charges ranging from entertaining evil spirits to bewitchingpeople to death. Five of these were reprieved, and the remaining eight werethrown back into jail for further investigations.Before the Chelmsford trial was finished, Hopkins found himself greatly indemand. In times of war and public misfortune, distractions are welcomed.Hopkins moved around Essex, finding more witches, and accepting payment for histrouble; at Aldeburgh he was paid £6 for finding a witch, and at Stowmarket thelocal authorities paid him £23. In the days when a working wage was sixpence aday, these were large sums. During his year as witchfinder, Hopkins and hisassistants made about £1,000, according to Summers. In Bury St Edmunds, heplayed his part in having 200 people arrested; 68 of whom were hanged. He movedaround Suffolk and Norfolk, finding witches in every place that invited him, andin a few that he selected for himself.In April 1646, a Huntingdon clergyman named Gaule attacked Hopkins from thepulpit and published a pamphlet about his methods of ‘torture’. Torture ofwitches was still forbidden by law in England, but Hopkins used othermethods—‘pricking’ for Devil’s marks (areas the Devil had touched were supposedto be insensitive to pain), ‘swimming’—which meant that the bound victim wastossed into a pond, and if she floated, she was innocent—and depriving of sleepfor days on end, a method still used in ‘brain-washing’. The pamphlet was widelyread, and it turned the tide against Hopkins. One historian of witchcraftrelates that Hopkins was seized by an angry crowd and made to endure the waterordeal. He was, in any case, a sick man. He retired to Manningtree, and diedthere later that year of tuberculosis.Robbins estimates that Hopkins was responsible for several hundred hangings(witches in England were never burnt, although the North Berwick witches inScotland were burned for having plotted against the king’s person). And with hisdownfall, mass witch trials ceased in England. In America, the most famous wasstill to come. The explosion of superstition and violence that occurred inSalem, Massachusetts, in 1692, is still one of the most puzzling episodes inAmerican history. For most writers on the case—including Arthur Miller, whodramatised it in The Crucible—there is no mystery: a few bored and naughtychildren became obsessed by the voodoo tales of a black servant, and decided topretend they were bewitched. Egged on by the local minister, a man of paranoidtendencies, they accused various people of witchcraft. The whole thingsnowballed until over 200 people were accused, 22 of whom were executed or diedin prison. Then, as suddenly as it began, the hysteria faded away. And the Salemwitchcraft trials virtually ended the ‘witchcraft craze’ in America as thedownfall of Matthew Hopkins ended it in England.The case may not be as simple as it looks. Even Rossell Hope Robbins admits‘motives are very elusive’. Clearly, these children were not really ‘bewitched’.But they behaved in some ways like the ‘possessed’ nuns of Loudun orAix-en-Provence, or like some teenagers who are the ‘focus’ of poltergeistoccurrences.The Revd. Samuel Parris was not a popular man, for he seems to have been anunpleasant character, mean and bad-tempered. He had brought with him fromBarbados a number of black servants, including a woman called Tituba, and herhusband, ‘John Indian’. During the long winter evenings, Tituba talked to thechildren about witches and spirits. His daughter Elizabeth, aged 9, her cousinAbigail Williams, aged 11, and a friend called Ann Putnam, 12, soon beganbehaving very oddly, having convulsions, screaming and talking disconnectednonsense. A doctor called in to ‘cure’ Elizabeth said he thought she wasbewitched. Other ministers were consulted, and decided that the Devil wasinvolved. Questioned—and beaten—by Parris, Tituba agreed that the Devil hadinspired her to ‘work mischief’ against the children, and named a pipe-smokingbeggar woman named Sarah Good as an accomplice. The children also mentionedSarah Good as well as a bedridden old woman, Sarah Osborne. When a magistratenamed Hathorne asked the girls about their convulsions, they began to moan withpain, and declared that the ‘spirit’ (or spectre) of Sarah Good was biting andpinching them. Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne both denied in court that they knewanything about witchcraft, but Tituba admitted it all with a certain relish; shewent on expanding her confessions for three days. Tituba declared that SarahGood and Sarah Osborne had been present at a witches’ Sabbat, and added thatthere were two more local women whom she did not know. This caused widespreadgossip and speculation. 12-year-old Ann Putnam put an end to this by declaringthat one of the witches was a woman called Martha Cory—who had laughedunbelievingly when the girls threw their convulsions—and that the other was asaintly old lady named Rebecca Nurse. A farmer named Proctor—another sceptic—wasalso accused.The whole area was now in the grip of a witchcraft scare; people were afraid togo out after dark because witches were supposed to be able to turn themselvesinto animals or night-birds—a remnant of legends of werewolves and vampires.Eight more local children became ‘afflicted’ and screamed out the names of‘witches’ who were tormenting them. A woman named Bridget Bishop—who had areputation for being ‘fast’—was tried and executed in June 1692. Sarah Osbornedied in prison, but Sarah Good was tried and executed, together with fourothers, in July. A minister named George Burroughs was denounced, and he wasalso tried and executed.The more hysteria increased, the more the girls—now eleven of them—seemed to betormented by devils. By September, the death toll had increased to 20, and oneunfortunate man—Giles Corey—was literally pressed to death under enormousweights in an effort to force him to confess. He refused (although it would havesaved his life) because his goods would have been forfeit to the state, and hehad no intention of dying a pauper. His wife was hanged as a witch.The various girls were called to neighbouring towns to identify witches, and itlooked as if the trials and executions would spread to Andover and Boston. TheAndover magistrate declined to sign more than 40 warrants and had to flee withhis wife to escape being tried as a witch. Then the girls began to overreachthemselves. They named the wife of the governor, Sir William Phips, as a witch,and the president of Harvard College; the magistrates told them sternly thatthey were mistaken, and this was the beginning of the end of the persecutions.When Governor Phips returned from fighting Indians on the Canadian border, hedismissed the court and released many of the accused. In further trials,‘spectral evidence’—the notion that the disembodied spirits of witches couldtorment their victims—was disallowed, and only three people out of 52 werecondemned. Phips reprieved them, released all others from prison, and the Salemcraze ended abruptly about a year after it began. One of the girls, Ann Putnam,later confessed that she had been ‘deluded by Satan’ when she accused RebeccaNurse and others. The Reverend Parris, now attacked and denounced, left Salemwith his family. Abigail Williams, according to legend, became a prostitute.Even Montague Summers agrees that the Salem trials were the result of hysteriaand the ‘diseased imaginings of neurotic children’. But he was convinced thatthere is positive evidence of involvement in witchcraft in a few of the cases.It seems probable that George Burroughs, Bridget Bishop and Martha Carrier weremembers of a coven—although they had nothing to do with ‘bewitching’ thechildren.And what about the children? All writers on the affair assume that they weremischievous, ‘prankish’, and that the whole thing snowballed out of a harmlessgame. But what was this game? The answer, fairly certainly, is some form of‘magic’. Tituba was familiar with voodoo and obeah. And the essence of voodoorituals—as David St Clair emphasises in Drum and Candle and Guy Playfair in TheFlying Cow—is the evocation of ‘low grade’ spirits to do the bidding of themagician. The three children, bored with the long winter in the dreary NewEngland village, undoubtedly ‘tried out’ what Tituba had taught them. Theirintentions were harmless enough—rather like a modern child playing with a ouijaboard or automatic writing. But two of them at least were at the dangerous agewhen children become the focus of poltergeist phenomena—Ann Putnam was twelveand looked older. We do not know very much about ‘possession’, and the usualtheory is that it is pure hysteria; but again, anyone who takes the trouble toread T.K. Oesterreich’s classic Possession: Demoniacal and Other, or MartinEbon’s anthology Exorcism: Fact not Fiction will see that there is a very thindividing line between ‘possession’ and being a focus of poltergeist activity.This is a matter to which we shall return in the next chapter.The storm that ended the witchcraft craze in France emphasises once again thatwitchcraft can have a genuinely sinister face.In 1673, during the reign of Louis XIV, two priests informed the police in Paristhat a number of penitents had asked absolution for murdering their spouses. Nonames were mentioned, because of the secrecy of the confessional, but it alertedthe Chief of Police, Nicholas de la Reynie. What was happening, it seemed, wasthat a ring of fortune-tellers and ‘sorcerers’ were supplying ‘successionpowders’—a euphemism for poisons—to wealthy men and women who preferred loversto matrimonial entanglements.De la Reynie could only keep his ear to the ground. It took him four years tofit together the clues that led him to the recognition that there was aninternational ‘poisons ring’—much as there are now drugs rings—headed by men ofinfluence. A remark of a fortune-teller, Marie Bosse, about being ready toretire when she had arranged three more poisonings, provided the lead he hadbeen waiting for. A disguised policewoman consulted Marie Bosse on how she couldget rid of her husband, and made an arrest when she was sold poison. Manypoisons were found in Marie Bosse’s house. She and her husband and two sons werearrested; also, another fortune-teller known as La Vigoreux, who shared acommunal bed with the family.Interrogations began to reveal the names of their customers, and the revelationshocked the King. It seemed that half the aristocracy were trying to poison oneanother, and that two ladies had even approached another fortune-teller formeans of getting rid of one of his own mistresses Louise de la Vallière.But this was not simply a matter of murder or attempted murder. The customerswere also convinced that the fortunetellers could produce charms and magicpotions to secure the affections of their admirers, and apparently had noobjection if the Devil was involved.Stern and decisive action was called for—after all, the king might be the nextvictim . . . He created a special commission, a kind of Star Chamber, which satin a room draped in black curtains and lit with candles—hence the ChambreArdente—the lighted (or burning) chamber.What made it so frightening was that the methods of poisoning were so subtle. AMadame de Poulaillon, who wanted to kill her aged husband so she could marry heryoung lover, had been impregnating his shirts with arsenic, which would causesymptoms similar to those of syphilis; she would then rub the sores with a‘healing ointment’ that would kill him in ten weeks—and there would be nosuspicion.The chief defendants were Marie Bosse, La Vigoreux, an abortionist known as LaLepère, and a well known fortune-teller called Catherine Deshayes, known as LaVoisin. La Vigoreux and Marie Bosse were quickly condemned—on May 6,1678—to beburnt alive and one son, Frangois Bosse, hanged. La Voisin was horriblytortured, and, when she refused to confess to poisoning, burnt alive in an ironchair—Mme de Sevigné described in a letter how the old woman cursed violentlyand threw off the straw half a dozen times, until the flames became too strongand she disappeared in them.All this was kept secret; one reason being that the king’s mistress Mme. deMontespan was deeply involved. And more investigation revealed that variouspriests had performed Black Masses and even sacrificed babies to the Devil. Ahunchback, the Abbé Guibourg used as an altar the naked body of a woman, placingthe chalice on her belly; Mme. de Montespan had often served as the altar. Ababy would then be sacrificed by having its throat cut, and the body thrown intoan oven. La Voisin confessed at her trial that she had disposed of 2,500 babieslike this. On another occasion, Mme. des Oillets came to make a charm for theking, accompanied by a man. The priest said that sperm from both was necessary,but since Mme. des Oillets was menstruating, he accepted a few drops ofmenstrual blood from her, while the man masturbated into the chalice.Many other priests proved to be involved, and it became clear that an alarmingnumber of churchmen had no objections to dealings with the Devil. One hadconsecrated a stone altar in a brothel, another strangled a baby after baptisingit with oil reserved for Extreme Unction, another copulated with the girl whowas serving as an altar in full view of his audience; another fortune tellerdescribed how she had sacrificed her own new-born baby at a Black Mass.By 1680, it had struck the king that a full-scale scandal could lead tounforeseen results, since so many nobles were involved. He decided to suspendthe Chambre Ardente. No noblemen—or women—were sentenced, but de la Reyniecontinued to arrest and torture fortune-tellers. 104 people were sentenced: 36to death, others to slavery in the galleys or banishment. The chief result ofthe case was that fortune-tellers were banned by law, and witchcraft wasdeclared to be a superstition. After that, people accused of witchcraft weresent to a madhouse, the Salpêtrière. In fact, a man was executed in Bordeaux in1718 for causing a man to become impotent and his wife barren; but then, working‘fancied acts of magic’ was still a hanging offence.Louis attempted to suppress all the evidence for the affair in 1709 by orderingall papers to be destroyed; but the official transcripts were overlooked.It seems incredible that, at the time Isaac Newton was writing the Principia,priests and ‘witches’ should be sacrificing babies at Black Masses. If we takethe rational view of witchcraft—as a mediaeval superstition—it is virtuallyimpossible to understand what they thought they were doing. Was it all, perhaps,a kind of escapism, a desire to indulge in ‘wickedness’ for the sake ofexcitement, like some of the modern witchcraft covens? The French aristocracywas decadent, but surely not decadent enough to indulge in the 17th centuryequivalent of ‘snuff movies’? The truth is obviously simpler: that Marie Bosse,Catherine Deshayes and La Voisin had learned witchcraft from their aunts orgrandmothers—like Jehanne de Brigue—and were simply practising a traditionalcraft that had been handed down for centuries. And the aristocrats whopatronised them did so because they knew that their ‘magic’ often worked. Thewitches themselves were sure it worked.That view offends modern common-sense. It offended my common-sense at the time Iwrote The Occult. Yet in retrospect, I can see that I was not being quiteentirely logical. For as early as 1964, in a book called Rasputin and the Fallof the Romanovs, I had cited a number of cases that seemed to show that Africanwitchcraft really works. The travel writer Negley Farson, whom I knew wellduring the last ten years of his life, told me that on several occasions he hadseen a Liberian witch-doctor conjure rain out of a clear sky. And a neighbour,Martin Delany, who had been the Managing Director of a large company in Nigeria,and himself possessed slight thaumaturgical gifts, had described to me how thelocal witch-doctor had promised that the heavy rain which had been falling fordays would stop for two hours to allow a garden party to take place; the rainhad stopped a few minutes before the party was due to start, and begun again aminute after it finished. The stoppage was confined to an area of approximately10,000 sq. yds.This, of course, could have been some natural ability akin to ‘psychokinesis’—Ihave a book called The Power of the Mind by Rolf Alexander which has fourphotographs claiming to show how a large cloud was disintegrated bypsychokinesis in eight minutes at Orillia, Ontario, on September 12, 1954. Butthe same explanation cannot be applied to another strange event described byMartin Delany, which I quote from his own account:‘Having just returned from leave in Europe, I was informed by my Europeansawmill manager that an extraordinary incident had taken place in the sawmill afew days prior to my return. A hen, from a nearby compound, had flown straightinto the large Brenta band-saw and was instantly cut to pieces by the blade ofthe saw, which revolves at about 10,000 revolutions per minute. The Nigerianmill-workers were very perturbed by this—they knew now that the ‘Iron God’ wasangry and seeking blood and, unless blood was offered by the witch doctor toappease the ‘God’, then he would demand other victims. They therefore requestedthat the band-saw should be stopped until the necessary sacrifice had been madeby the witch doctor.‘I refused their request for two reasons, firstly because an urgent export orderfor lumber had to be completed, and secondly because the sacrifice involveddecapitating a puppy dog and sprinkling the blood over the machine, and this Iwas most reluctant to permit. In fact, I hoped that the whole thing was anisolated incident soon to be forgotten. Two days afterwards another hen flewinto the band-saw. This caused consternation among the Nigerian workers, whoagain approached me, but I again refused. Four days after this incident theEuropean manager was asked by the Nigerian foreman in my presence if he wouldcome to the band-saw to adjust the saw-guides as the saw-blade was not cuttingevenly; this adjustment was usually done by the manager. We watched as the veryrigid drill, essential when adjustments or repairs were made to the band-saw,was carried out. The electricity was cut off at the mains and the starterswitches were put in the ‘Off position. Then, and only then, was anyonepermitted to commence work on the band-saw. I watched with interest, pleased tonote that the drill had been faithfully carried out, and turned to leave themill when suddenly, to my horror, I heard the first sounds which indicated thatthe saw had commenced to turn. Rushing to the band-saw I discovered that themanager’s hand had been badly cut by the saw-blade which had revolved possiblysix or seven times. By now, the Nigerian staff were in a state of extreme fear,so I decided to close the mill for the rest of the day and sent for two Europeanexperts, one an electrician, the other a sawmiller. They examined the machine,the starter motors, the mains switches, checking in every possible way, only tostate that everything was in perfect order and that it was utterly impossiblefor the band-saw to start up when the mains and starter motor switches were off.I confess that I was badly shaken by this last incident, but still refused tohave the witch doctor in because of a natural repugnance to the particular formof sacrifice. I suggested finding blood for the sacrifice from a dead hen or thelocal meat market, but to this the witch doctor would not agree. The men werepersuaded to return to work only by an offer of additional money and theassurance that the machine, etcetera, were in perfect order, having been checkedby the European experts. There was a lull for about two weeks and everyoneconcerned was beginning to relax when with horrifying and brutal suddenness the‘Iron God’ struck. The band-saw had just commenced to saw through a log, the7-inch wide saw-blade was turning at maximum revolutions when without warningand for no known reason the saw-blade started to peel in a thin strip commencingat the rear. Within a second or so a tangled mass of peeled saw-blade burst outand struck the operator in the chest and face, inflicting serious wounds; infact, he died before he could be carried out to the waiting estate car.Operators are never protected (i.e. caged in with protective mesh) with thistype of saw as normally there is no need, the saws having adequate guards. A MrStenner of Stenners Ltd. of Tiverton said some time later that never before inhis many years of manufacturing band-saws had he heard of such a thingoccurring. So I finally gave way to the demands of the workmen, who would nothave worked in the sawmill at any price until the witch doctor had made thesacrifice to the ‘Iron God’. The band-saw stopped operating two years ago, butduring the eight years from the date of the operator’s death it functionedwithout hitch. The death of the operator was duly recorded in police records. Itis interesting to note that when the United Africa Company opened their verylarge sawmill, costing several million pounds, at Sapele in Eastern Nigeria, thewitch doctor was called in to make the appropriate sacrifice to the ‘Iron God’.’Martin Delany was not of the opinion that the witch doctor himself had causedthese accidents by some form of ‘psychokinesis’—he described him as an amiableold gentleman. He believed that if the occurrences were not simply accidents,then they were caused by the fear of the natives somehow acting upon the saw—aform of negative psycho-kinesis.It seems clear that witchcraft is still a living force in Africa and that it hasbeen witnessed by many balanced and level-headed western observers. In a bookcalled Ju-ju in My Life, James H. Neal, former Chief Investigations Officer forthe Government of Ghana, tells some baffling stories. His first acquaintancewith African witchcraft occurred when he visited a port being built at Tema andwas told that a certain small tree had defied all efforts to move it. The mostpowerful bulldozers failed to tear it out of the ground. The African foremanexplained that the tree was a Fetich—that it was inhabited by a spirit, and thatthe only way to move it was to ask the spirit to leave it for another tree.Finally, the Fetich Priest was called; he asked for three sheep, three bottlesof gin, and a hundred pounds if he succeeded in moving the tree. The blood ofthe sheep was sprinkled round the base of the tree, then the gin; then thepriest went into a semi-trance, and begged the spirit of the tree to vacate itfor a better tree, on the grounds that the port would afford employment for manyblacks. After various rituals, the priest announced that the spirit had agreedto leave. To Neal’s astonishment, a small team of men then had no difficulty inpulling the tree out of the ground with a rope . . .This story is interesting because it makes clear the place of ‘spirits’—oftennature spirits—in witchcraft. This aspect, I am inclined to believe, is moreimportant than anyone has given it credit for. It emerges again clearly in anepisode in Laurens Van Der Post’s book The Lost World of the Kalahari, in whichhe describes how a guide offered to take him to a mysterious region called theSlippery Hills—the one condition being that there must be no killing of animals.Van Der Post forgot to tell the advance party, who shot a warthog; from then on,everything went wrong. The camera and tape recorder jammed continually, althoughthey had given no trouble before, and the camera swivel failed. They wereattacked by bees. Their guide warned them that the spirits were angry; when hetried to pray, some invisible force pulled him over backwards. Finally, hethreaded a needle, placed it in his hand, then went into a semi-trance, staringat it. He began to speak to invisible presences, and told Van Der Post that thespirits would have killed him if they had not known that his intentions—invisiting the Slippery Hills—were pure. Van Der Post suggested that he wrote aletter of apology, which they all signed, and buried in a bottle at the foot ofa sacred rock painting; from that moment, the ‘jinx’ went away. The guideremarked later that the spirits were now far less powerful than they used tobe—once they would have killed on sight anyone who had approached sounceremoniously.The notion of elemental spirits—inhabiting trees or hills—strikes the westernmind as totally preposterous. Yet it was not always so. In Ireland—even inCornwall, where I live—there is still a great deal of belief in fairies andnature spirits in remote country areas. In the 1920s, a psychic named GeoffreyHodson specialised in describing elementals and nature spirits, and his bookabout them—entitled, rather off-puttingly, Fairies at Work and Play was takenseriously by many people involved in psychical research. (Hodson himself was aTheosophist.) Here is a typical description of what he calls a ‘nature deva’,encountered in June 1922 when climbing in the Lake District:‘After a scramble of several hundred feet up a rocky glen we turned out to oneside, on to the open fell where it faces a high crag. Immediately on reachingthe open we became aware, with startling suddenness, of the presence of a greatnature-deva, who appeared to be partly within the hillside.‘My first impression was of a huge, brilliant crimson bat-like thing, whichfixed a pair of burning eyes upon me.‘The form was not concentrated into the true human shape, but was somehow spreadout like a bat with a human face and eyes, and with wings outstretched on themountain-side. As soon as it felt itself to be observed it flashed into itsproper shape, as if to confront us, fixed its piercing eyes upon us, and thensank into the hillside and disappeared. When first seen its aura must havecovered several hundred feet of space . . .’We find such notions absurd; but they would be accepted by most primitivepeoples. From the Eskimos to the Ainus of Northern Japan, from the Orochon ofSiberia to the Indians of Tierra del Fuego, the shaman is the intermediarybetween this world and the world of spirits. A man became a shaman throughpainful ordeals, both physical and spiritual. An Eskimo shaman told the Danishexplorer Rasmussen: ‘I could see and hear in a totally different way. I hadgained my enlightenment, the shaman’s light of brain and body, and this in sucha manner that it was not only I who could see through the darkness of life, butthe same bright light also shone out from me, imperceptible to human beings, butvisible to all spirits of earth and sky and sea, and these now came to me as myhelping spirits.’ The idea of being able to see the world of the spirits ‘ofearth and sky and sea’ can be found in all shamanistic religions.This curious oneness with nature enables the shaman or witchdoctor to exert hispower over animals. In The Occult I have quoted that amazing passage from SirArthur Grimble’s book Pattern of Islands, describing how a ‘porpoise caller’withdrew into his hut for several hours, where he went into a trance; in thistrance, apparently, his spirit went out to sea and summoned the porpoises.Finally, he rushed out of the hut calling ‘They come, they come’. And toGrimble’s astonishment, they did come. The villagers waded into the sea andstood breast deep and hundreds of porpoises swam slowly into the beach,apparently in a state of hypnosis, allowing themselves to be beaten to death.Ross Salmon, a British explorer who spent much of the 1960s and 70s in search ofthe ‘lost world of the Incas’, has described in a book called My Quest For ElDorado a ceremony among the Callawaya Indians of northern Bolivia which revealsthis same intimacy between man and nature. A girl named Wakchu had been accusedof being unfaithful to her husband during his absence, and the village eldersdecided that she would be ‘tried’ by the condor, the sacred bird of the village,which was believed to embody the spirit of a famous hero. Ross Salmon was givenpermission to film the whole ceremony. He described, in a television interviewaccompanying his film, his incredulity at the idea that the priests could summona condor—a shy bird, which he had never seen at close quarters. Wakchu was tiedto a pole at the top of the cliff, wearing only a loincloth, and the threepriests began a ceremony to call the condor, supported by a chorus of women. Forhalf an hour, nothing happened, and Salmon became convinced it was a waste oftime. Then, to his amazement, an enormous condor flew overhead, together withtwo females. It landed near Wakchu, strutted around for a while, then rantowards her and pointed its beak at her throat. The villagers murmured ‘Guilty’.One of the camera crew threw a stone at the bird, which flew off. Wakchucommitted suicide a few days later by throwing herself from a cliff. Sheevidently accepted the judgement of the condor.1Another account of life among South American Indians conveys this same sense ofintimacy with nature. Wizard of the Upper Amazon by F. Bruce Lamb tells thestory of Manuel Córdova-Rios, who was kidnapped by the Amahuaca Indians of theAmazon, and who lived among them for many years. Much of their ‘magic’ wasinvolved with hunting, and apparently worked. Rios witnessed a method of luringpigs. It was important for the hunters to kill the sow who led a band of pigs.Then her head was buried in a hole, facing the opposite direction from which thehunters were travelling. The hole was filled in while the hunters sang chants tothe spirits of the forest. If this was done correctly, the pigs would continueto pass over this spot at regular intervals, in the circuit of their territory.It also seems that the Amahuaca Indians are capable of group telepathy as wellas of this kind of direct contact with nature. Clearly, their modes ofperception are more ‘right-brain’ than ours. But since we now know that ourleft-brain perception has been developed by the pressures of civilisation, andthat the being who lives in the right is virtually a stranger, there is lessreason for dismissing these stories of primitive empathy with nature as oldwives’ tales.It now becomes possible to understand the ceremonies performed by our Cro-Magnonancestors before setting out on hunting expeditions, and those cave paintings ofshamans performing ritual dances and wearing the skins of animals. The purposeis not simply to locate the herd of animals to be hunted the next day (shamansshould be regarded as mediums rather than magicians), but to somehow lure it toa place where the hunters can find it, as Grimble’s porpoise-caller lured theporpoises.Recent research has demonstrated fairly convincingly that circles of standingstones like Stonehenge and Avebury were intended as solar and lunar calendars.The discoveries of ‘ley hunters’ like John Michell seem to suggest that therewere also temples for the performance of fertility rituals. But I remainconvinced that if we are to understand the real purpose of the standing stones,we have to put ourselves into the state of mind of the Callawayas or Amahuacas,and understand that the ancient priests were probably shamans who went into atrance and conversed with nature spirits, asking them to guarantee the abundanceof the harvest.Once we begin to understand this, we can also understand the origins of‘witchcraft’. A shaman who has the power to converse with ‘spirits’ to ask themto bless his tribe may also make use of them to revenge himself on an enemy. InThe Occult, I have described the theory advanced by anthropologist Ivar Lissnerabout why our ancestors suddenly ceased to make images of human beings. Theyreasoned that if ‘magic’ could be used to destroy a reindeer or bear, it couldalso be used to destroy another human being. So the making of images becametaboo—or something carried out in secret by ‘black’ magicians—those who wouldlater be called ‘followers of the left hand path’. (It is significant that ourancestors equated the left with the sinister—sinister in Latin means left—whileright was synonymous with goodness; they were clearly aware that the two aspectsof the human mind are separate, but had no means of knowing that the right halfof the brain governs the left half of the body and vice versa.)Neal’s Ju-ju in My Life describes his own gradual conversion to belief in themalevolent power of witch-doctors—in this case, through unpleasant personalexperience. When, as chief investigations officer for the Government of Ghana,Neal caused the arrest of a man who had been extorting bribes, he found that hewas the target for a ju-ju attack. It began with the disappearance of smallpersonal items of clothing—as in the case of David St Clair. One day he foundthe seat of his car scattered with a black powder; his chauffeur carefullybrushed it off, and urinated in it to destroy its power. Then, one night, Nealbecame feverish, and experienced pains from head to foot. He felt he was goingto die. Suddenly, he found himself outside his body, looking down at himself onthe bed. He passed through the bedroom wall, and seemed to be travelling atgreat speed, when suddenly he seemed to receive a message that it was not yethis time to die; he passed back into his room, and into his body. After this hespent three weeks in hospital suffering from an illness that the doctors wereunable to diagnose. An African police inspector told him he was being subjectedto a ju-ju attack. More black powder was scattered in his car. One night, lyingin bed, he felt invisible creatures with long snouts attacking his solar plexusand draining his vitality. A witch-doctor who was called in described in detailtwo men who were responsible for the attacks—giving an accurate description oftwo men involved in the bribery case. Finally, after a ceremony performed by aMuslim holy man—who surrounded the house with a wall of protection—Neal slowlyrecovered. The white doctor who tended him agreed that he had been victim of aju-ju attack.He also describes how, not long after the ‘exorcism’ ritual, his servant killeda cobra outside his bungalow. As they were exulting about the death of thesnake, Neal noticed another snake—this time a small grey one—slithering towardsthem. When he drew the servant’s attention to it, the man went pale. This, theman said, was a ‘bad snake’—meaning a snake created artificially bywitch-doctors; a man bitten by such a snake has no chance of recovery. Neal wasunderstandably sceptical. Then he saw the snake—which was still slithering at agreat speed towards them—come to a halt as if against an invisible wall. It hadencountered the ‘wall of protection’ put there by the holy man. With a singlestroke, the servant chopped off its head with a cutlass. No blood came out. Soonafter this, Neal began to itch all over. Two perfectly healthy trees just beyondthe ‘wall of protection’ split down the middle with a loud crash. Consultationwith another skilled sorcerer elicited the information that both Neal and hisservant were victims of a new ju-ju attack, but that because of the‘protection’, Neal could not be seriously harmed; the itch was the worst themagician could do.This kind of witchcraft can be found in primitive societies all over the world.In a book called Mitsinari, a Catholic priest, Father André Dupreyat, describeshis years in Papua, New Guinea. When he clashed with local sorcerers, he wasalso placed under a ‘snake curse’. One day, walking towards a village, he wassurprised to see a silvery-coloured snake wriggling towards him. The villagersall scattered. Knowing it would have to lower its head to come closer, Dupreyatwaited until it was no longer in a position to strike, and killed it with hisstick. The next day, when he was lying in a hut, a snake lowered itself from theroof-beam and dropped on to his chest. He lay perfectly still until it slid downto the floor, when he was able to kill it with a stick. A few days later, as helay in a hammock, a native warned him that two black snakes had writhed up thesupport of the hammock, and were close enough to bite him. They cautiouslyhanded him a knife and told him when to strike; he succeeded in killing bothsnakes.Dupreyat also has a remarkable account of a local sorcerer named Isidoro who wasable to turn himself into a cassowary (a kind of ostrich). One evening as theyall sat talking of Isidoro, they heard the distinctive sound of a cassowaryrunning, and Isidoro came into the hut. He talked with them for a while, thensaid he would be staying in a house in the village overnight, and went out. Theyagain heard the sound of a cassowary running. Dupreyat checked, and found thatIsidoro was not in the house where he had claimed he would be staying. The nextday, he visited Isidoro’s village—five hours away on the other side of themountain. There he was greeted by Isidoro. Villagers assured him that Isidorohad spent the early part of the previous evening in the communal hut, then goneaway at seven o’clock. By nine o’clock he had been with Dupreyat, a five-hourjourney away on the other side of the mountain. And at dawn, he had beenobserved in his own village again. Yet in the dark, it was at least aneight-hour journey away,James Neal’s own experiences of witchcraft in Ghana ended disastrously. Leavinghis home in a hurry, on a morning when he intended to go to the Accra races—tocapture a race-course gang—he left behind a protecting amulet that had beengiven him by the holy man. From an almost empty grandstand he watched the menbeing arrested by his own officers. Then, walking down from the grandstand, withno one within twenty yards of him, he was pushed violently, and fell. Themultiple fractures he sustained kept him in hospital for months; and when herecovered, his broken bones prevented him from continuing his police work and hewas forced to resign. The holy man, who came to see him in hospital, told himthat he had been pushed by an ‘astral entity’. Neal insists that, as he waspushed, he twisted round to see who was responsible, and that there was no onethere.It was while writing about cases like these that I came to recognise that it wasillogical to accept evidence about witchcraft in Africa, and reject the samekind of evidence about witchcraft in Europe. It is possible that the Chelmsfordwitches, the North Berwick witches, the Auldearne witches, were innocent victimsof a barbarous superstition. It is equally possible that, like the umbandamagicians of Brazil, they had learned to make use of the ‘spirit world’ fortheir own purposes. Montague Summers was not being as absurd as he sounded whenhe declared that modern spiritualism is a revival of mediaeval witchcraft.It was in the 1880s, at the time when the Society for Psychical Research wastrying to place the study of the paranormal on a scientific footing, that modernscholarship turned its attention to witchcraft. An American scholar namedCharles Leland became fascinated by the English Gypsies—as George Borrow hadbeen half a century earlier—and became president of the Gypsy Lore Society. In1886 he went to Florence, continuing his studies of Gypsy magic and lore, andencountered an Italian witch named Maddalena, who told fortunes and soldamulets. He employed Maddalena to gather what traditions she could about theorigins of Italian witchcraft, which was known as la vecchia religione, the oldreligion. She finally provided him with a handwritten manuscript called Aradia,or the Gospel of the Witches. This tells the story of how the goddess Diana hadan incestuous affair with her brother Lucifer, and gave birth to Aradia (orHerodias); it was Aradia who eventually came down to earth and taught men andwomen the secrets of magic. This, according to the Gospel of the Witches, wasbecause the Church and the aristocracy were treating the poor with such crueltythat Diana felt they needed to be provided with some means of self-defence. Thatis to say, witchcraft was originally a movement of social protest, like thePeasants’ Revolt. In his Witchcraft, Magic and Alchemy (1931), Grillot de Givryhits upon the same idea: ‘. . . it is perfectly logical that certain men . . .having seen that God possessed his rich and honoured Church on earth . . .should have asked themselves—above all, if they believed that they had a rightto complain of God, Who had condemned them to a wretched state of life anddenied them worldly goods—why Satan . . . should not have his Church also . . .why they themselves should not be priests of this demon, who would, perhaps,give them what God did not deign to give . . .’There is every reason to believe that Aradia is a genuine document, for therecould be no possible reason to forge such a work. It would hardly attract theattention of anyone but a folk-lorist—and, in fact, it went out of print almostimmediately. It provides one of the most powerful pieces of evidence thatwitchcraft was a survival of a pagan cult of the moon and earth goddess—afertility cult.During the First World War, an English archaeologist named Margaret Murray wasliving in Glastonbury when she decided to study the history of witchcraft.Without, apparently, studying Aradia (at least, she never mentions it), MargaretMurray reached the conclusion that witchcraft was a survival of a paganfertility cult. It was her view that the image of the Devil—as a horned man witha tail—originated in the hunting rituals of our Cro-Magnon ancestors in whichthe shaman wore the skin of the animal about to be hunted. When man became afarmer rather than a hunter, he directed his magic towards the earth with theobject of ensuring a good harvest. These innocent pagan festivals continued downthe ages. The Church attempted to stamp them out, partly because they were apagan survival, partly because of their strong sexual undertones—but in manycountry areas the ‘old religion’ was simply blended with the new; dances arounda maypole replaced the pagan fertility ceremony with its ritual phallus.In recent years, Margaret Murray’s theory—which was once accepted by mostrespectable scholars—has been violently attacked, on the grounds that shecensored the evidence about witchcraft cults and sabbats to support hertheories. And there can be no doubt that her later book The Divine King inEngland (which appeared when she was 94) is wildly eccentric, with its theorythat many English kings were members of the ‘old religion’. Yet no one who looksimpartially at the evidence can doubt that witchcraft was closely bound up withthe cult of Diana, and that many of its ceremonies were pagan survivals. In hisbook The Roots of Witchcraft, Michael Harrison mentions that after the SecondWorld War, Professor Geoffrey Webb was given the task of surveying damagedchurches, and discovered that many altars of churches built before the BlackDeath contained stone phalluses. (Scholars have long been puzzled by carvings onmany ancient churches showing a crouching woman holding open the lips of hervagina—they are known as Sheila-na-gigs.) Harrison also mentions an eventdocumented in the Bishop’s Register of Exeter in the 14th century, which statesthat the monks of Frithelstock Priory in Devon were caught by the Bishopworshipping a statue of ‘the unchaste Diana’ in the woods, and made them destroyit. Why ‘unchaste’ Diana, when she is usually known as the ‘queen and huntress,chaste and fair’? Because the Bishop recognised the ceremony for what it was—afertility ritual.Amusingly enough, Montague Summers is enraged by the theory of Margaret Murray,and denounces it as imaginative moonshine. He is determined to promote his ownview that the witches were genuine heretics, inspired by the devil, and that thechurch was right to ‘stamp out the infection lest the whole of society becorrupted and damned’. As we have seen, there is a great deal to be said for hisopinions—even though he takes them to the point of absurdity. He is almostcertainly in the right when he attacks Margaret Murray’s view that Joan of Arcand Gilles de Rais were priests of the Dianic cult who were sacrificed for theirfaith.All of which only demonstrates that the subject of witchcraft is far morecomplicated than at first appears. The truth seems to be roughly this: the ‘oldreligion’ survived from the days of our Cro-Magnon ancestors, and in lateNeolithic times led to the construction of stone ‘temples’ like Avebury,Stonehenge and Carnac. This religion involved the invocation of earth spiritsand deities—like Van Der Post’s ‘spirits of the Slippery Hills’. It managed toco-exist quietly with Christianity in Europe—although the authors of the CanonEpiscopi knew about it nearly a thousand years before John XXII made it a crime.Almost certainly, it had nothing to do with the rise of Catharism, whose rootsare in Manichaeism and Gnosticism. But the persecution of the Cathars drew theattention of the Church to the Old Religion, with dire results. In fact, one ofthe first results of the persecution of witches was probably to cause them toband together and take their stand against the doctrines of Christianity. So, tosome extent, the church created the heresy it was so determined to destroy. Ifwe can believe Aradia, they did worship the devil—or Lucifer, the sun god—aswell as his sister Diana. And many of them probably practised ancient forms ofmagic passed down from palaeolithic times. It was not the Church that stampedout witchcraft—it was Newton and Leibniz and Dalton.1951 was a watershed in the history of witchcraft, for it was in that year thatthe Witchcraft Act was finally repealed in Britain. In the view of the BritishParliament, the act was obsolete. Legislators believed that there were nowitches in Britain, and probably never had been.One man who strongly disagreed with this point of view was Gerald Gardner. Hewas the author of a book called High Magic’s Aid, which described in detailvarious rituals used by medieval witches. In 1954, three years after the repealof the Witchcraft Act, Gardner published a book called Witchcraft Today in whichhe made it fairly clear that he was himself a practising witch. He declared thatthere were still dozens of covens—groups of witches—in England, practising therites he had described in his earlier book.Witchcraft Today is a fascinating but irritating book. In her introduction to itMargaret Murray says that ‘Dr Gardner has shown in his book how much of theso-called “witchcraft” is descended from ancient rituals, and has nothing to dowith spell-casting and other evil practices.’ In fact Gardner shows nothing ofthe kind. What he does is to develop and popularise the views put forward thirtyyears earlier by Margaret Murray herself. As we have seen, Dr Murray maintainedthat witchcraft, or the ‘Dianic Cult’ as she called it, is an ancient paganreligion, older by far than Christianity. She traced the cult back toprehistoric worship of the fertile Great Mother, the oldest of all ancient gods,and of the Horned God, a primitive symbol of power. Taking up this theme,Gardner declared that witchcraft was the religion of the first inhabitants ofBritain. He suggested that these ancient Britons were pygmies or ‘littlepeople’, and were the origin of the legends of fairies, elves, and dwarfs. Undersuccessive waves of invaders these Little People were driven into hiding, takingwith them their old religion. When the rest of Britain became Christianised theycontinued to hold their strange, orgiastic ceremonies in remote places. Thesuperstitious peasants were afraid of them, but noblemen and their ladies oftenjoined in.These incredible assertions, along with the implication that modern witchespractised sexual orgies, aroused the interest of the British press. At the ageof 70, Gardner suddenly found himself famous. Popular Sunday newspapers soughthim out and printed his descriptions of witches’ meetings called Sabbaths orSabbats—complete with naked witches and ritual floggings. Gardner himself turnedout to be the kind of man who makes good copy for sensational journalists. Hewas born in Lancashire in 1884, the son of a wealthy timber merchant. His fatherwas a noted eccentric who used to remove all his clothes and sit on themwhenever it rained. Gardner developed a taste for voyeurism and for beingspanked, during boyhood travels in the Middle East with a buxom Irish nurse.Later, nudity and ritual flagellation were to feature prominently in hiswritings about witchcraft. He lived in the East until 1936, developing a tastefor weapons, particularly knives. His first book was a study of the Malayankris, a dagger with a wavy blade. Then he returned to England and became astudent and practitioner of magic. According to his own account, hisintroduction to witchcraft occurred in 1946 when he was living in the New Forestin southern England. There he met a witch called Old Dorothy—allegedly anaristocrat—who taught him about the cult of witchcraft, and convinced him thatit was the survival of an ancient pagan religion.The truth of this account has since been widely questioned. Some of Gardner’s‘age-old’ rituals have been criticized as the products of his ownimagination—both by sceptics unsympathetic to witchcraft and by witchesunsympathetic to Gardner. He was not, apparently, a particularly truthful man.In various reference books he described himself as a Ph.D. and a D.Litt.Elsewhere he admitted that he had never attended a university. A professor atLeeds University has told how Gardner read a paper on Manx fishing craft to anInternational Congress on Maritime Folklore, conveying the impression that itwas based on his own research. In fact, the paper had been lifted almostentirely from an article that had appeared in the Proceedings of the Isle of ManNatural History Society. In spite of his critics, however, Gardner drew hundredsof new recruits to the cult of witchcraft, and when he died at the age of 80,British newspapers ran headlines on the death of the ‘King of the Witches’.Whatever his standing as a scholar, Gardner had become recognized as the leadingfigure in the witchcraft revival. Since his death witchcraft covens have sprungup all over Britain and the United States, and there are now estimated to bebetween 10,000 and 20,000 active witches in the United States alone.Under the influence of Margaret Murray and Gerald Gardner, witchcraft today isdominated by the so-called white witches who claim to be on the side of good.Sybil Leek, one of America’s leading living witches, was formerly head of anEnglish coven centred in the New Forest. In an interview with London’s DailyExpress in 1964 she declared, ‘I am a white witch and come from a long line ofwhite witches, who exist only to do good.’The white witches of the 20th century stand outside the European-American witchtradition with its emphasis on Devilworship. Modern white witches claim, likeGardner, to be the inheritors of an ancient religious tradition, and not a cultof evil. They point to the derivation of the word ‘witch’ from the Anglo-Saxonwicca meaning ‘the wise one,’ and use the word Wicca as a name for their cult.The white witches, like their black opposites, use many of the techniques ofsorcery and engage in activities that resemble many of the quasi-religiousceremonies of traditional witches. Their worship, however, is directed towardthe Earth Mother and the Horned God, and they emphatically deny that there isany link between the Horned God and the Devil. According to Gardner, thetwo-faced Horned God worshipped by the followers of Wicca is not Satan, but afertility god usually known by the Roman name of Dianus or Janus. He representsthe cycle of the seasons and the crops, and the rites performed in his honourare designed to ensure the continued fruitfulness of the earth. He has also beenrelated to the famous prehistoric painting in the Trois Frères Caves in theFrench Pyrenees, which appears to depict a dancer in the skin of an animal withgreat branching antlers. Gardner suggests that the horns on the god led to theconfusion with Satan in the minds of Christians, and that some witches may haveencouraged this confusion to keep their enemies at a distance.In the later years of his life, Gardner settled in Castletown on the Isle ofMan, where he founded a witchcraft museum. After his death the museum was takenover by Monique Wilson, a Scottish witch who is known as ‘the Lady Olwen’, andher husband Campbell, a former bomber pilot. Monique Wilson also assumed thetitle of ‘Queen of the Witches’. In a recent interview with the Britishjournalist Colin Cross she explained: ‘It is a title conferred by three or morewitch covens. It is supposed to be an honour but really it means that I carrythe can when anything goes wrong. I adjudicate on disputes that arise in covensunder my jurisdiction. Of course there are many covens which are entirelyindependent. I used to be the only Witch Queen but a few years ago we crownedone for America, where witchcraft is growing very rapidly.’Monique Wilson estimated that there were about 2,500 witches in Britain. Othershave put the figure much higher, at between 5000 and 10,000. ‘A coven consistsof a minimum of two members and a maximum of 13; when it reaches the limit, itsubdivides,’ Mrs. Wilson explained. ‘A female witch is always initiated by aman, and a male one by a woman.’Witches are usually naked for their rituals, but the Wilsons denied that thewitchcraft movement is really a cover for sex. ‘I daresay there are one or twoso-called covens which operate for sexual reasons,’ said Campbell Wilson.‘Anyone can read a book and start his own coven with his own rules. But in realwitchcraft sex is only a very small part of the whole.’The Wilsons went on to say that there are a few black witches—those who usetheir power to do people harm—but in their view such witches were rare. However,sufficient evidence exists to suggest that these darker powers of witchcraft—thepower to cast damaging spells and lay curses—are no mere superstition, and thatthey are still being practised today.In the encyclopedia Man, Myth and Magic, the photographer Serge Kordievdescribed how he and his wife became members of a coven. After he had written anarticle in a Sunday newspaper describing his interest in the occult, he receiveda telephone call from a man who asked whether he would be interested in joininga witch cult. He said yes. By appointment the Kordievs were picked up in anexpensive car and driven to a large old house. After being given drinks at a barthey were told to strip and put on small black satin aprons. They were thentaken into a large room with a black floor and red carpets hanging on the walls.Half a dozen hooded figures stood in front of an altar. A naked man, his bodygleaming with oil, appeared before the altar. Two black-robed girls stood oneither side of him. The Kordievs were ordered to kneel, to swear perpetualhomage to Satan, and to sign their oaths in blood. They were then given magicalnames, and the naked man placed his hand on their genitals, causing ‘a curioustingling sensation’.After several more meetings the Kordievs began to have second thoughts about thecult. On one occasion a young girl was accused of betraying the group’s secrets.She was made to serve as a human altar while a Black Mass was said over her,after which she was ravished by the Master. When the Kordievs discovered thatthey still had to go through a ‘confirmation ceremony’ which involved sexualintercourse with the Master and with a High Priestess, they decided to leave thegroup. Almost immediately their troubles began. One day they returned home lateat night to discover an enormous toad sitting on the front doorstep. On anotheroccasion they heard sounds of maniacal laughter and smashing glass coming fromKordiev’s studio. When they investigated they found that the studio had beenwrecked. But the doors were still locked, and the windows had apparently beensmashed from inside, with all the glass scattered outside on the lawn. Therefollowed many months of bad luck.In his book Experiences of a Present Day Exorcist, the Reverend Donald Omandgives his opinion that a great deal of ‘black magic’ is the result of a kind ofhostile thought-pressure. He is firmly convinced, for example, that when aworker in a factory is ‘sent to Conventry’ (an English term for ignoring aco-worker as punishment) the hostile thought waves from the others may causeactual physical and psychological damage—quite apart from any effects that couldbe ascribed to the power of suggestion. Readers of Ira Levin’s novel Rosemary’sBaby will remember the episode in which a circle of black witches causesomeone’s death by ‘ill wishing’. It could well be that ‘ill wishing’ and theReverend Donald Omand’s ‘hostile thought-pressure’ are one and the samephenomenon.Witchcraft and black magic have achieved an even greater popularity in theUnited States today than in Britain. The white witches of the United Statesclosely resemble their British counterparts, however, and their activities arelargely based on the rituals revived or devised by Gerald Gardner. The twoleading white witches of the United States, Sybil Leek and Raymond Buckland, areboth of British origin. Sybil Leek claims to trace her witch ancestry back tothe 12th century. After her arrival in the United States in 1964, she rapidlybecame a popular radio and television personality. She now lives in Houston,Texas, where she organizes classes in the occult, broadcasts a nightly radioshow, and runs a restaurant called ‘Sybil Leek’s Cauldron’.Compared with Sybil Leek, Raymond Buckland has a far more reserved approach tohis craft, but he has probably done more than any other American witch to givemodern witchcraft a serious image. The High Priest of a New York coven, Bucklandedits a monthly magazine on witchcraft called Beyond, and has founded his ownwitchcraft museum on Bay Shore, Long Island. A one-time disciple of GeraldGardner, Buckland is scornful of those who claim to be ‘King’ or ‘Queen’ of thewitches, declaring that the witchcraft movement is far too scattered for such atitle to have any meaning. Nevertheless, there have been many attempts to unitethe witches of the United States, including the New York-based WitchesInternational Craft Association. This organization is a kind of ‘Witches’Liberation Movement’.American witchcraft also has its darker side with an upsurge of interest in thepractice of black magic and Satanism. Most of the black magic groups are locatedin California, and the rise of such evil cults has been linked with theincreased use of hallucinogenic drugs such as mescalin and LSD.America’s most notorious black witch is an ex-circus ringmaster and policephotographer, Anton Szandor La Vey. On April 30, 1966 La Vey initiated the‘First Church of Satan’ on California Street in San Francisco (April 30 isWalpurgis Night, the great feast of the witches’ year). La Vey and his followersopenly practice black magic, putting evil curses on their opponents, performingweddings, funerals, and baptisms in the name of Lord Satan, and preaching‘indulgence instead of abstinence’. The Church of Satan is dedicated to theworship of the Devil and the glorification of carnal pleasures—a far cry fromthe assurances of Sybil Leek and the Wilsons.La Vey, known variously as the ‘High Priest of Hell’ and the ‘Black Pope ofAmerica’, goes out of his way to look satanic by wearing a pointed black beard,Fu Manchu moustache, and shaven head. He is the author of a work called TheSatanic Bible, which contains invocations to Satan in a language called‘Enochian’ and La Vey’s own system of ‘satanic morality’. States La Vey,‘Blessed are the strong, for they shall possess the earth. Cursed are thefeeble, for they shall be blotted out!’La Vey’s church is expanding, but there are many students of the occult whoclaim that no one can handle black magic without risk. An event that took placein 1967 seems to support this view. On the evening of June 29 a middle-aged mansuddenly collapsed on the floor of his San Francisco apartment. He and hisfamily were all members of La Vey’s church. As his wife and son knelt besidehim, trying to revive him, they heard a woman’s voice coming from his lips,saying, ‘I don’t want to die.’The mother and son immediately recognized the voice as that of actress JayneMansfield, a fellow member of La Vey’s congregation. Later they learned that theactress had died in a road accident earlier that very evening. She had beendriving with her attorney on a narrow road near San Francisco when a truckhurtled from under a narrow bridge, and crashed into their car. Jayne Mansfieldwas decapitated, and her attorney, Sam Brody, was also killed.Newspaper reporters soon unearthed a story of violent conflict between Brody,who was Jayne Mansfield’s lover as well as her attorney, and La Vey. It arosebecause Jayne Mansfield’s film studio was grooming her as a successor to MarilynMonroe, and rumours of her membership of the Church of Satan were bad publicity.Brody threatened to start a newspaper campaign that would drive La Vey out ofSan Francisco, and La Vey retaliated by pronouncing a solemn ritual curse onBrody. He told Brody that he would see him dead within a year, and shortlybefore Jayne Mansfield’s death he warned her not to share Brody’s car. ‘She wasthe victim of her own frivolity,’ said La Vey dispassionately after the crash;but there were members of California’s occult underground who declared openlythat La Vey’s curse had got out of hand, killing the disciple as well as theunbeliever.In Britain, it has also become clear that the modern witchcraft cult has itsnegative side, as cases involving ‘black magic’ and ritual child abuse have madenational headlines. Just before midnight on July 10, 1971, two police officerson the island of Jersey, in the English Channel, set off in pursuit of a carthat had shot through a red light at high speed. After a chase they caught upwith the driver when he abandoned his car in the middle of a field. More policearrived and helped subdue the furiously struggling man. As they bundled him intoa police car, one of them noticed something strange about his clothes. Two rowsof sharp nails protruded from the shoulders of his jacket. He had another row ofnails on his lapels, and wore bands studded with nails on his wrist. At thepolice station the man was searched. In his pockets police found a wig, a rubberface mask, and a length of pajama cord. It seemed that they had finally caughtthe ‘Jersey rapist’—a man who had been terrorising the island for more than adecade.The attacks had begun in 1957 when three women had been assaulted by a man witha knife. In April 1958, a man threw a rope around the neck of a girl, draggedher into a field, and raped her. In October 1958, a girl was dragged from acottage and raped. For over a year attacks ceased. Then in January 1960, theytook a more alarming turn. A 10-year-old girl woke up to find a man in herbedroom. He warned her that if she cried out he would shoot both her parents.The man was wearing a rubber mask. He sexually assaulted the girl in her own bedand left by the window, driving off in her father’s car. One month later therapist assaulted a 12-year-old boy. For the next eleven years repeated attacksmade Jersey an island of terror. In many cases the masked rapist carried a childout into the garden, committed the assault, and took his victim back to thebedroom.When the police in 1971 captured the man with a mask and a pajama cord in hispocket, they had little doubt that he was the rapist. His name was Edward JohnLouis Paisnel, and he was in his early 50s.Questioned about the peculiar attire he was wearing when he was found, Paisneltold the police that he was on his way to some sort of ‘orgy’. He implied thatthis gathering was connected with black magic, and explained that all theparticipants were unknown to one another, because they wore masks.When the police visited Paisnel’s home, they discovered that he slept apart fromhis wife in his own room. In this room they found an alcove containing whatappeared to be a small altar. On the altar stood a china toad and a smallchalice. Suspended above these objects was a dagger on a length of cord.In the same room the police found a cupboard that swung away from the wall onhinges. Behind it was a small room containing a blue track suit and a fawnraincoat with nail-studded lapels. Earlier descriptions of the Jersey rapist hadmentioned a blue track suit and fawn raincoat.Nevertheless, Paisnel continued to protest his innocence. He insisted that hewas a member of a black magic group and had no connection with the rapes. Thencame the break. The car Paisnel had been driving before his arrest proved tohave been stolen. In the glove compartment the police discovered a crucifix madeof palm fronds—apparently the property of the car’s owner, The detective incharge of the case threw it on the table in front of Paisnel and asked: ‘Is thisyours?’Paisnel’s face went red. His eyes bulged. Then he began to laugh. ‘No, it’s notmine.’ Then after a pause: ‘My master would laugh very long and very loud atthis.’The detective had no need to ask him the name of his ‘master’. In Paisnel’s roomthe police had found various books on witchcraft and black magic. Paisnel wasspeaking of the Devil.The police made one more interesting find. Among Paisnel’s books was a biographyof the 15th-century child-murderer, Gilles de Rais—the man on whom the story ofBluebeard was based. Gilles de Rais had been one of the richest noblemen inEurope, and had fought bravely at the side of Joan of Arc against the English.His extravagance forced him to mortgage many of his estates, and finally hebegan to practise black magic, hoping that with the aid of the Devil he coulddiscover the secret of turning lead into gold. Some of these black magic ritualsrequire the ‘blood of innocent virgins’, and this may explain how Gilles came toacquire his taste for killing children. When Gilles was arrested—for assaultinga priest in the course of a quarrel—his mansion was searched, and thedismembered remains of more than fifty children were found in a locked tower.Gilles admitted that he had murdered the children after committing sadisticattacks on them. He was burned at the stake in October 1440.It gradually became clear to the police that Paisnel was obsessed by Gilles deRais. It even seems likely that he believed himself to be a reincarnation ofGilles. No other members of the ‘black magic group’ were ever discovered.Presumably they existed only in Paisnel’s imagination. Charged with seven sexualassaults, Paisnel was found guilty and sentenced to thirty years’ imprisonment.It seems certain that Paisnel was no armchair student of the occult. Hepractised black magic, and he believed that he had sold his soul to the Devil.He worshipped his ‘master’ before an altar, and he probably offered up prayersbefore he set off in search of victims.The logical view of all this is that he was simply a ‘sex maniac’ who indulgedin devil-worship as a kind of imaginative exercise that enabled him to ignorehis conscience. (A ‘devotee’ always has that advantage over an unbeliever.) Butthis chapter should at least have raised some doubts about the logical view. Thetruth is that our scientific rationalism has blinded us to the truth behindwitchcraft. And in order to grasp that truth, we have to begin by recognisingthat all primitive people take the reality of the ‘spirit world’ for granted. Wealso have to recognise that circumstantial reports of ghosts can be counted intheir thousands, that they date back as far as recorded history, and that to tryto dismiss all this as superstition is mere silliness. We may reject theChristian notion of the Devil as an embodiment of evil (because surely evil ismerely another name for stupidity?), just as we reject the Manichaean notionthat matter itself is evil, while still recognising that the evidence for theexistence of ‘spirits’ is very powerful indeed. And the history of spiritualism,like the history of witchcraft, demonstrates that it is not difficult for humanbeings to establish contact with ‘spirits’, and that some do so easily andnaturally.So it would probably be a mistake to dismiss Paisnel’s devil-worship as sheerself-delusion. The more likely truth is that he was a man whose fantasies hadopened him to certain dark forces, and who had become a willing tool of thoseforces in exchange for the satisfaction of sexual cravings—in short, that he haddone what a mediaeval theologian would call ‘sold his soul to the Devil’.It is also interesting to note that his charmed life of immunity came to an endwhen he stole a car containing a Christian crucifix . . . 1.

They are able, to someextent, to influence these like-minded people and to make them do their willthrough suggestion. Some ‘low spirits’ are activated by malice; others aremerely mischievous, and can use energy drawn from human beings to cause physicaldisturbances—these are known as poltergeists. When Kardec asked: ‘Do spiritsinfluence our thoughts and actions?’, the answer was: ‘Their influence upon[human beings] is greater than you suppose, for it is very often they who directboth.’ Asked about possession, the ‘spirit’ explained that spirits cannotactually take over another person’s body, since that belongs to its owner; but aspirit can assimilate itself to a person who has the same defects and qualitiesas himself, and may dominate such a person. In short, such spirits could bedescribed as ‘mind parasites’. (According to Kardec’s view, when people indulgein sexual fantasy, they may be providing a kind of pornographic film-show forsome homeless spirit, which will then try to influence them to providing more ofthe same kind of entertainment by putting sexual thoughts into their heads.)The classic modern book on the subject—Possession, Demoniacal and Other(1921)—is by a Tübingen professor, T.K. Oesterreich, and it takes, as one mightexpect of a respectable academic, a totally sceptical view: Oesterreichdismisses the ‘spirit’ explanation, insisting that possession is always a caseof hysteria or mental illness. He will not even accept the hypothesis ofmultiple personality, since he cannot believe that the human personality can‘split’.One of his most impressive pieces of evidence for the hysteria theory is alengthy account of the famous case of ‘Achille’, described by the psychiatristPierre Janet. Achille, a moderately successful businessman, came from a peasantbackground, and married early. In the winter of 1890, when he was 33, Achillereturned from a business trip in a depressed condition, then suddenly went dumb.One day, he sent for his wife and child, embraced them despairingly, then wentinto a cataleptic state for two days. When he woke up he was suffering fromdelusions; he seemed to think he was in Hell, and that demons were burning himand cutting him in pieces. The room, he said, was full of imps, and he waspossessed by a devil. After a number of suicide attempts, he was sent to theSalpêtrière Hospital in Paris, under the care of the famous physician Charcot.The latter placed Janet in charge of the case.Janet watched with interest as Achille displayed all the signs of demoniacalpossession, as described in the Middle Ages: in a deep voice he cursed God, thenin a shrill voice protested that the Devil had forced him to do it.At first all Janet’s efforts to communicate were a failure; Achille refused tolisten to him and resisted all attempts to hypnotise him. Janet saw a possiblesolution when he observed that Achille was extremely ‘absent-minded’—he compareshim to someone searching for an umbrella which he holds in his hand. WhileAchille was raving, Janet quietly inserted a pencil in his hand, then triedordering him, in a whisper, to make writing movements. The pencil wrote: ‘Iwon’t.’ ‘Who are you?’ asked Janet, and the pencil wrote: ‘The Devil.’ ‘I shan’tbelieve you,’ Janet replied, ‘unless you can give me proof. Can you make Achilleraise his left arm without knowing it?’ ‘Of course. . .’—and Achille raised hisarm. ‘Why are you doing that?’ Janet asked Achille in his normal voice, andAchille looked at his raised arm with astonishment.The demon went on to demonstrate his powers by making Achille dance, stick outhis tongue and kiss a piece of paper. Finally, Janet asked him if he could putAchille into a deep sleep. Moments later, Achille was in a trance. And now Janetwas able to question him about the cause of his illness, and quickly learnedthat Achille had been unfaithful to his wife while away on his business trip,and that deep and intense guilt had caused the depression and other symptoms.Now he was able to induce hallucinations, Janet made Achille believe that hiswife was in the room, and had forgiven him for his infidelity. (It is not quiteclear from Janet’s account whether the wife actually came to the hospital.)After this, Achille’s psychological problems soon cleared up.This is certainly a remarkable case. Yet as a refutation of the ‘spirit’ view,it is obviously open to one serious objection. If Kardec is correct, it isobvious that people suffering from nervous traumas or states of intense guiltand misery are more likely to become ‘obsessed’ by spirits than normal healthypersons. Kardec would point out that Achille may have been genuinely ‘obsessed’by a mischievous spirit, and that as soon as Janet had made him feel that he wasforgiven, the spirit was ‘driven out’.The same view of ‘possession’ was expressed by Carl Wickland, a Los Angelesdoctor: in his book Thirty Years Among the Dead, he argues that a great deal ofmental illness is caused by a kind of mental invasion by ‘homeless spirits’.Wickland, born in Leiden (Sweden) in 1861, had emigrated to Chicago, where hegained his medical degree; he became a member of the National Association forthe Advancement of Science, and a medical adviser to the Los Angeles branch ofthe National Psychological Institute. It seems likely that he decided to burnhis boats and publish his book because, at 63, he was on the verge of retirementanyway, and ridicule would make no difference.It all began, he explained, with a patient whom he calls Mrs Bl-, who began topractise automatic writing, and who soon began to have fits of derangement inwhich she used vile language and claimed she was an actress; she had to becommitted to an asylum. Another woman, ‘an artist and lady of refinement’,became convinced that she was a damned soul and knelt in the mud to pray at thetop of her voice. Another woman, who owned a millinery shop, posed in her windowin her nightclothes, declaring that she was Napoleon, and had to be removed bythe police.Now at this time—in the mid-1890s—the main theory of mental illness was that itcould be explained in purely physical terms; many a head physician in a mentalhome was appointed because he had a working knowledge of brain anatomy. Freudhimself was an early convert to this theory (known as organicism), hisprofessor, Dr Theodore Meynert, being one of his chief advocates—he later turnedhis back on Freud when the latter returned from Paris espousing a new‘psychological’ explanation of neurosis based on the idea of the unconsciousmind. In America, the favourite theory of mental illness was that it was due topoisons in the system due to such causes as infected tonsils or decayed teeth.But Wickland was intrigued by the case of a youth called Frank James who, aftera fall from a motor-cycle at the age of ten, changed from an affectionate,obedient boy to a juvenile delinquent who spent many terms in reformatories andjails. Declared hopelessly insane, he succeeded in escaping from the criminalasylum, and during his recapture was hit on the head with a club. On awakening,he had once again reverted to his earlier personality—gentle and good-natured.This convinced Wickland of the inadequacy of the ‘toxaemia’ theory. And while hewas still a medical student, the accident of marrying a woman who proved to bean excellent ‘medium’ soon provided him with evidence of an alternative theory.One day, Wickland was dissecting a leg in the medical school, and, on his returnhome, was alarmed when his wife Anna seemed to be about to faint. He placed hishand on her shoulder, and was startled when she drew herself up and saidthreateningly: ‘What do you mean by cutting me?’ After a few questions, itbecame clear that he was speaking to the spirit of the owner of the leg he hadbeen dissecting. Wickland guided Anna to a chair, and the spirit objected thathe had no right to touch him. When Wickland replied that he was touching hiswife, it retorted: ‘What are you talking about? I am no woman—I’m a man.’Eventually, Wickland reasoned it into recognising that it was dead, and thatdissecting its old body would do it no harm. When it asked for a chew of tobaccoor a pipe, Wickland had to explain that his wife was a non-smoker. (The next dayhe observed that the teeth of the corpse were heavily stained with tobacco.)More detailed explanation finally convinced the man that he was dead, and heleft.This showed Wickland that a ‘ghost’ may believe that it is stillalive—particularly if death came unexpectedly. He also encountered a case thatseemed to demonstrate that spirits did not need to manifest themselves through a‘medium’. When he was alone one day, dissecting a female corpse, he thought heheard a distant voice shout: ‘Don’t murder me!’ A newspaper on the floor made arustling noise, as if it was being crushed. Some days later, at a seance, aspirit who gave her name as Minnie Morgan claimed that it was she had shouted‘Don’t murder me!’ and crushed the newspaper. Minnie also had to be convincedthat she was no longer alive.At seances, entities who spoke through his wife later explained to Wickland thatsuch ‘homeless spirits’—those who are unaware that they are dead—are attractedby the warmth of the ‘human aura’—a kind of energy-sphere which is supposed tosurround the human body—and, under certain circumstances, may attach themselvesto its owner as a kind of mental parasite. In effect, such spirits are in astate of sleep, in which dreams and reality are confused, and—as in sleep—thedreamer is unaware that he is dreaming.In her introduction to a new edition of Oesterreich’s Possession, the paranormalinvestigator Anita Gregory has some harsh words to say about Wickland and hisThirty Years Among the Dead, She points out that there is a basic sameness aboutall his cases—he always has to convince a spirit that it is dead—and his accountof how the spirits of Madame Blavatsky and Mary Baker Eddy expressed contritionfor their false doctrines is almost laughable. Yet anyone who then turns toWickland’s book will have to admit that these objections are less important thanthey sound. For the central issue is of Wickland’s honesty. Unless we decide totake the view that he was a liar and self-deceiver on a practically unimaginablescale—which seems unlikely—then it seems clear that his evidence is in totalagreement with Kardec’s views on possession. Even Anita Gregory has to admitthat Oesterreich’s rationalism is often crude and unconvincing, and that hedeals with subtleties by ignoring them.Perhaps the most obvious example of Oesterreich’s failure to allow facts tospeak for themselves is in his account of one of the most famous of all cases of‘possession’, that of ‘the Watseka wonder’, a girl called Lurancy Vennum. InJuly 1877, 13-year-old Lurancy, of Watseka, Illinois, had a fit, after which shebecame prone to trances. In these trances she became a medium, and a number ofdisagreeable personalities manifested themselves through her. On February 11,1878, placed under hypnosis by a local doctor, Lurancy stated that there was aspirit in the room called Mary Roff, and a Mrs Roff who was also presentexclaimed: ‘That’s my daughter’. Mary had died at the age of 18, twelve yearsearlier. Lurancy then stated that Mary was going to be allowed to take over herbody for the next three months.The next day, Lurancy claimed to be Mary Roff. She asked to be taken back to theRoffs’ home, and on the way there recognised their previous home, in which theyhad lived while she was alive, and which was unknown to Lurancy. She alsorecognised Mary Roff’s sister, who was standing at the window. And during thenext few weeks, ‘Mary’ showed a precise and detailed knowledge of the Roffhousehold and of Mary’s past, recognising old acquaintances and toys andrecalling long-forgotten incidents. On May 21, the day she had declared she hadto leave, she took a tearful farewell of her family, and on the way home‘became’ Lurancy again. The case was investigated by Richard Hodgson, one of themost sceptical members of the Society for Psychical Research, who was convincedof its genuineness.Readers of Hodgson’s account of the ‘Watseka wonder’ will find it very hard tofind loopholes; Mary provided such detailed proof of her knowledge of her earlyyears, and of the family background—recognising unhesitatingly anyone Mary hadknown—that the notion of trickery or delusion becomes untenable; it is perhapsthe single most convincing case of ‘possession’ in the history of psychicalresearch. But Oesterreich merely quotes William James’s summary of the case—fromPrinciples of Psychology—making no attempt to analyse it, and passing on quicklyto other matters—in spite of the fact that James himself had spoken of ‘theplausibility of the spiritualistic interpretation of the phenomenon’. And AnitaGregory concludes her own introduction by admitting that she is unable todeclare that all the people in Oesterreich’s book are frauds, dupes, lunaticsand psychopaths, and ends: ‘So I shall conclude . . . that the phenomenadescribed by Oesterreich are very much in need of an explanation.’Oesterreich’s pièce de résistance is a long account of the famous case of the‘Devils of Loudun’, which, in 1952, was made the subject of a full-length studyby Aldous Huxley. In 1633, Urbain Grandier, the parish priest of the smallFrench town of Loudun, was charged with bewitching the nuns in a local conventand causing them to be possessed by demons, so that they screamed blasphemiesand obscenities, and writhed about on the floor displaying their private parts.Grandier had become notorious for his immoralities—he had impregnated two of hispenitents and seduced many others—and had made many enemies. Inquisitors claimedto find ‘devil’s marks’ on his body, and in a trial that was a travesty ofjustice, he was found guilty and sentenced to be burned alive. Even undertorture, and later at the stake, Grandier maintained his innocence. His deathmade no difference, and the nuns continued to be possessed by ‘demons’ for manyyears after.Oesterreich, like Aldous Huxley, takes the view that all this could be explainedsimply in terms of hysteria, (a view I must admit that I shared at the time Iwrote The Occult) while another authority, Rossell Hope Robbins, goes evenfurther in his Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology, and attributes themanifestations to outright imposture. But a careful reading of Huxley’s own bookmakes either of these explanations seem implausible. It is easy to see howsex-starved nuns could deceive themselves into believing that they werepossessed by devils—the Mother Superior of the convent, Soeur Jeanne des Anges,admits in her autobiography that she made no real attempt to combat thepossession because she enjoyed the sexual stirrings aroused in her by thedemons. But it is far more difficult to understand what then happened to theexorcists themselves. Fr. Lactance, who had superintended the torture, became‘possessed’ and died insane within a month; five years later, Fr. Tranquilledied of exhaustion after months of battling against the ‘invaders’ of hispsyche, and was amazed to witness his body writhing on the ground and hearhimself uttering blasphemies which he was powerless to prevent. Fr. Lucas,another of Grandier’s persecutors, met the same fate. The ‘witch pricker’, DrMannouri, also died in delirium. Fr. Jean-Joseph Surin, a genuinely saintly man,who was called to Loudun to try and exorcise the nuns after Grandier’sexecution, himself fell victim to the ‘devils’, and became periodically insanefor twenty-five years. It is difficult to believe that ordinary hysteria couldproduce such results. Surin described in a letter how the ‘alien spirit’ wasunited to his own, ‘constituting a second me, as though I had two souls . . .’Considering these facts, the sceptical Anita Gregory admits that ‘one isprobably not justified in assuming that . . . the Loudun pandemonium [was]necessarily nothing but collective delusion.’ And bearing in mind Kardec’scomment that ‘a spirit does not enter into a body as you enter into a house . .. he assimilates himself to a [person] who has the same defects and the samequalities as himself, the hypothesis that the Loudun ‘pandemonium’ was caused byWickland’s earth-bound spirits seems, on the whole, more plausible thanreligious hysteria.It is difficult to draw a clear dividing line between ‘possession’ andpoltergeist manifestations. The most widely held current view, as we have seen,is that they are a form of ‘spontaneous psychokinesis’ (mind over matter) causedby the unconscious mind of an emotionally disturbed adolescent, but this theoryfails to explain how the unconscious mind can cause heavy objects to fly throughthe air—in laboratory experiments, ‘psychics’ have so far failed to move anyobject larger than a compass needle. According to Kardec’s ‘informants’,poltergeists are earthbound spirits who are, under certain conditions, able todraw energy from the living, and to make use of negative energies ‘exuded’ bythe emotionally disturbed and the sexually frustrated.The Loudun case seems to provide support for this view, Soeur Jeanne’sautobiography makes it clear that her own sexual frustrations alone could haveprovided a host of ‘entities’ with the necessary energy. And by the time a dozenor so nuns were writhing on the floor and making suggestions that caused evendecadent aristocrats to blush, the convent must have been awash with sexualenergy. Most cases of possession in nunneries seem to involve the same feverishsexuality. Two decades before the Loudun case, 14-year-old Madeleine deDemandolx de la Palud was seduced by her confessor, Fr. Louis Gaufridi, twentyyears her senior; the liaison was broken up, and she was sent to a nunnery atAix-en-Provence. Two years later, Madeleine began to see devils, and smashed acrucifix. Her hysteria soon spread to the other nuns; Madeleine accused Gaufridinot only of seducing her, but of introducing her to various diabolic practices.Gaufridi was asked to try and exorcise the demons, and, when he failed, was putin prison.At his trial, Madeleine declared that her allegations were all imaginings, afterwhich she began to move her hips back and forth in a ‘lascivious manner’. Thejudge chose to disbelieve her disclaimer, and Gaufridi was tortured until he‘confessed’, then was burned at the stake.It is important to realise that fornication among the clergy was a commonplacein the 17th century, and that seduction of nuns by their confessors was far fromrare. In 1625, an orphan named Madeleine Bavent was seduced by a Franciscanpriest, appropriately called Bonnetemps. In the following year she entered aconvent at Louviers run by Fr. Pierre David, who secretly belonged to theIlluminati—a sect who believed that the Holy Spirit could do no harm, and thattherefore sex was perfectly acceptable among priests. Fr. David apparentlyinsisted that Madeleine should strip to the waist as he administered communion;other nuns, she later claimed, strolled around naked. She claimed that she andFr David never engaged in actual intercourse—only mutual masturbation—and thatwhen Fr. David died in 1628, his successor Fr. Mathurin Picard continued tocaress her genitals during confession.It was after Fr. Picard’s death in 1642 (when Madeleine was 35) that the nunsbegan to manifest the usual signs of possession, writhing on the ground,contorting their bodies, and making howling noises like animals, as they allegedthey were being ravished by demons. Fourteen of the 52 nuns exhibited thesesymptoms, and all put the blame on Madeleine.Madeleine then told the full story of Fr. David, Fr. Picard, and the latter’sassistant Fr. Boulle. She claimed that Fr. Picard and Fr. Boulle had indulged invarious ‘magical’ acts involving communion wafers and menstrual blood, andeventually in ‘sabbats’, in which a Black Mass was recited. The priests haddraped their erections with consecrated wafers with a hole cut in the middle and‘thus arrayed gave themselves to the women present’—Madeleine being favouredfive or six times.Madeleine was accused of being a witch and discharged from the order; the corpseof Fr. Picard was dug up, excommunicated, and tossed on to a refuse heap. Thisled the priest’s brother to create a scandal, and the result was a trial thatended with Fr. Boulle being tortured and burned alive, together with anotherpriest called Duval. Madeleine, confined in a convent and brutally treated, madeseveral suicide attempts, and finally died at the age of 40. The Louviers nunswere all dispersed to other convents,Madeleine’s descriptions of sabbats and Black Masses sound like pure invention.But, as we saw in the previous chapter, the notorious Chambre Ardente (LightedChamber) affair, half a century later, revealed that many priests took part insuch practices. It is difficult for us to understand why the Church was involvedin this wave of demonology—the likeliest explanation is that 17th centuryrationalism was undermining its authority, and that the protest against thisauthority took the form of licentiousness and black magic. Whatever theexplanation, the Chambre Ardente transcripts leave no doubt but that it reallyhappened.Another investigator who came to believe that ‘possession’ was due to spiritswas Max Freedom Long, an American schoolmaster who arrived in Hawaii in 1917, atthe age of 27, and began to make a study of its native ‘magicians’, the Kahunasor ‘keepers of the secret.’1 According to the Huna religion, Long discovered,man has three ‘selves’, the ‘low self, the ‘middle self and the ‘high self. Thelow self is basically emotional, and corresponds roughly to Freud’s unconsciousmind. The middle self is our ordinary, everyday consciousness. The high selfmight be called the superconscious mind, and can foresee the future. Afterdeath, the three selves may become separated, and it is the low self thatsometimes becomes a poltergeist. The middle self may become a ‘ghost’. In hisbook The Secret Science Behind Miracles, Long also discusses the phenomenon ofmultiple personality, and expresses the view that this is often due to‘possession’, either by a low self or a middle self, or a combination of thetwo. He describes the case of a Californian girl with two personalities, whichtook over the body for years at a time, and how, when doctors tried toamalgamate the two under hypnosis, a third personality appeared, who told themthat the girl should be left as she was, with two spirits sharing the body. Thisthird personality Long believes to be the ‘high self’.Two more eminent American investigators came to accept the possibility of‘possession’. The philosopher William James was converted from his earlyscepticism to a belief in ‘spirits’ through the mediumship of Mrs Leonore Piper,whose ‘control’, Phinuit, was able to tell him all kinds of things that he couldnot possibly know by normal means. James was to agree that if a medium can be‘possessed’ by a spirit, then it is possible that other people might be. James’sclose friend Professor James Hyslop was another sceptic who was ‘converted’ byMrs Piper. But he had a more practical reason for becoming convinced of thereality of ‘possession’. When Hyslop was president of the American Society forPsychical Research in 1907, he was visited by a goldsmith named FrederickThompson, who was convinced that he had become ‘possessed’ by the spirit of apainter, Robert Swain Gifford, whom he had met on a few occasions. AfterGifford’s death, Thompson had begun to hear Gifford’s voice urging him to drawand paint—something he had never done before. Although he had no artistictraining, Thompson began to paint in Gifford’s style. What convinced Hyslop wasthat Thompson painted pictures of places that he had never been to, but whichGifford had. Some of these proved to be identical to Gifford’s finalsketches—which Thompson had never seen—and when Hyslop visited the New Englandswamps and coastal regions he recognised them as the subject of these sketches.Hyslop consulted a neurologist, Dr Titus Bull, about Thompson. And Bull himselfwas to to conclude that many cases of mental illness really involved‘possession’. In one case, the patient—who had suffered a head injury—claimedthat he had been ‘taken over’ by the spirit of a painter named Josef Selleny,who had been a friend of the Emperor Maximilian, and who was ‘forcing’ him topaint. (Wickland claimed that such accidents as head injuries would provideopportunity for alien ‘entities’ to invade.) Lengthy researches by Bull’sassistant Helen Lambert—a wealthy woman with time to spare—finally uncovered theexistence of a real Josef Selleny (the encyclopedias mistakenly spelt it Joseph,but the patient spelt it correctly), who had, indeed, been a friend of theEmperor Maximilian. A medium who worked with Dr Bull was able to reveal that thepatient was being possessed by several ‘entities’, one of whom seized possessionof her body and grabbed Bull by the throat. Eventually, the various entitieswere dislodged or persuaded to go away. Mrs Lambert’s account, later publishedin her book A General Survey of Psychic Phenomena, sounds remarkably like manycases described by Carl Wickland. The few available cases make it clear thatBull’s name deserves a distinguished place in the annals of psychical research.Dr Adam Crabtree, a psychiatrist who lives and works in Toronto, began to giveserious consideration to the idea of possession as a result of treating patientswho claimed to hear ‘voices’ inside their heads.Now such cases are not particularly rare, and ‘hearing voices’ is certainly nota sign of madness. Dr Julian Jaynes, a Princeton psychologist, began to make astudy of auditory hallucinations after experiencing one himself—he was lying ona couch when he heard a voice speaking from the air above his head. Naturallyconcerned about his sanity, Jaynes discovered, to his relief, that about ten percent of people have had hallucinations of some sort, and that about a third ofthese take the form of ‘phantom voices’. One perfectly normal young housewifetold him that she held long conversations with her dead grandmother everymorning when she made the beds.Jaynes, of course, takes it for granted that such experiences arehallucinations, and for a long time Adam Crabtree shared that belief. Then heencountered a case that raised some basic doubts. It concerned a young womannamed Sarah Worthington, who was the patient of a female colleague of Crabtree’scalled Jenny. After a treatment that had been initially successful, SarahWorthington had suddenly plunged into moods of depression in which she wastempted to commit suicide.The three of them met in Crabtree’s office, and he began to probe herdifficulties. One of his questions was whether she had ever heard voices insideher head, and she admitted that she had. Crabtree asked her to lie down andrelax, and to do her best to try to recall these inner conversations. Almostimmediately, the girl’s body tensed, and she exclaimed: ‘Oh, the heat! I’m hot!’And as she went on speaking, both psychiatrists observed the change in hervoice. Sarah lacked confidence; this new personality had the voice of someonewho was used to exercising authority. When they asked the woman what she wantedto do, she replied: ‘Help Sarah.’ It was a clear indication that this was notSarah. They asked the woman her name, and she replied: ‘Sarah Jackson.’ Sheidentified herself as Sarah’s grandmother. Crabtree explained that he and Jennywere also trying to help Sarah, and asked the ‘grandmother’ if she would bewilling to help; she replied yes. This ended the first session.At the next session, the grandmother soon came back. She was still talking abouta fire, and at one point she asked: ‘Where is Jason?’ Jason, it transpired, washer son, and the fire she was referring to had taken place in 1910. SarahJackson had rushed home as soon as she heard that there was a fire in herstreet—her seven-year-old son had been left in the house alone. The wholeneighbourhood was ablaze. In fact, Jason had been moved to safety by neighbours,but it took Sarah Jackson another hour to discover this, and in the meantime shehad rushed around the streets in a frenzy, stifling in the heat. The experiencehad imprinted itself deep in her consciousness.According to the grandmother, she had ‘taken possession’ of Sarah Worthingtonwhen her granddaughter was playing the piano—both of them loved music. And itsoon became clear that, in spite of her avowed intention of helping hergranddaughter, it was Sarah Jackson herself who was in need of help. She wastormented by guilt feelings about her own life—particularly about how badly shehad treated her daughter Elizabeth, Sarah’s mother. Elizabeth had developed intoan unhappy, neurotic girl, who had in turn treated her own daughter badly. AndSarah’s relations with her mother were a strange duplicate of Elizabeth’srelations with her mother. Both mothers had greatly preferred their son to theirdaughter, and had taught the daughter that men were everything and womennothing. The grandmother had become fully aware of all this by the time shedied, which is why she now felt that she had to help her granddaughter. Insteadof helping, she had made things worse; Sarah was frightened and confused by thevoice inside her, and was becoming desperate.Now grandmother Jackson was ‘out in the open’, things became much easier. Shewas able to give the psychiatrists invaluable information about Sarah’s familybackground. And although Sarah was at first astonished to realise that hergrandmother was speaking through her, she gradually learned to accept it, andbegan to achieve deeper insight into her problems. At the end of two months shewas cured. The grandmother remained a ‘possessing presence’, but now Sarahunderstood it she was no longer afraid; in fact, it gave her a sense of comfortto feel that her grandmother was a vaguely beneficent presence in the backgroundof her life.The reader’s reaction to this story is probably much the same as my own, when Ifirst read it in the typescript of Adam Crabtree’s Multiple Man: that there mustbe some purely psychological explanation. Sarah had known her grandmother as achild; perhaps she had heard the story about the fire from her own lips. Perhapsshe recognised how similar her mother’s problems had been to her own. And herunconscious mind had ‘re-told’ her the story as a rationalisation of her ownsufferings . . . But the more I read of Crabtree’s book (which his publishershad sent to me, asking if I would write an introduction) the more I saw thatsuch explanations are unacceptable. He goes on to recount another eight casesfrom his practice, each one involving some type of ‘possession’. And after thethird or fourth case, the unconscious mind explanation had begun to wear verythin. A social worker named Susan was unable to sustain any normal relationshipwith a male, and recognised, correctly, that this was due to some deepresentment towards her father. Crabtree was able to speak to her father—who haddied in a car crash—just as he spoke to Sarah’s grandmother, and he learned thathe had been sexually obsessed with his daughter. Until she was 16, he had creptinto her bedroom after she was asleep and had fondled her genitals. On someunconscious level, she was aware of what was happening. She recognised hisdesire for her, and treated him with contempt, behaving provocatively andexercising her new-found sexual power to make him squirm. The contempt spreadinto her relations with boyfriends and caused problems. When her father died inthe car crash, he was drawn to his daughter as a ‘place of refuge’, and she wasvulnerable to him because of the sexual interference. Once ‘inside’ her, he wasin a condition of ‘foggy sleep’, unaware of his identity or his presentposition. Crabtree patiently explained to Susan’s father that he was actuallydead, and that he ought to leave his daughter alone. And one day, he simplyfailed to appear at the therapeutic session; Susan experienced a sense of reliefand freedom.I found one case particularly fascinating and intriguing; it concerned auniversity professor called Art, whose first marriage had been unsuccessful, andwho was about to embark on a second. He was beginning to experience a deepreluctance to go through with the marriage, and he associated this with ‘innerstorms’ in which a censorious voice criticised him and various people he knew.He was vaguely aware that the voice sounded like his mother—who was living inDetroit—and he had arrived at the commonsense explanation that the voice wassome negative aspect of himself, and that he had somehow incorporated elementsof his mother, who had always been intensely possessive towards him.Crabtree followed his usual procedure, placing Art in a state of deeprelaxation, and then opening a dialogue with the mother, who was calledVeronica. Veronica was perfectly willing to talk at length about her relation toher son, and about why she disapproved of so many of his friends. ‘Veronica cameacross as blatantly, almost naively, self-centred . . .’ She explained that shesimply wanted to make her son recognise that many people he trusted—includinghis future wife—were stupid and scheming and not worthy of his respect.Crabtree asked her if she thought all this interference could be good for herson, or even good for herself, and she finally admitted that the answer wasprobably no. In Detroit she was living a drab and boring life, and Crabtreepointed out that if she paid more attention to her own affairs and less to herson’s, things might improve.During the therapy, Art’s mother discovered that she had a cancerous growth, andhad to have an operation. The ‘Veronica’ who spoke through Art’s mouth agreedthat this might be because she was robbing herself of vitality by ‘possessing’her son. And at this point, Art’s ‘inner voice’ began to fade, until he finallyceased to hear it. But there was a remarkable change in his mother in Detroit.She had been experiencing a slow deterioration, and emotional withdrawal fromlife. Now, suddenly, her vitality began to return; she started going out andmaking new friends. ‘She seemed to have gained the proverbial new lease onlife.’Crabtree insists that his own attitude towards such cases is not that of abeliever in the paranormal; he claims to be merely an observer, aphenomenologist, who simply treats each case ‘as if it were possession. Andclearly, there is nothing contradictory in such an attitude; Susan and Sarah andArt could have been manufacturing the voices themselves; the unconscious mind iscapable of far more remarkable feats. Still, the fact remains that most readerswill feel that, taken all together, these cases make an overwhelming impressionof being something more than unconscious self-deception.I turned back to Julian Jaynes to see what he had to say about ‘disembodiedvoices’. He outlines his theory in a remarkable work called The Origin ofConsciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, published in 1976(‘bicameral’ means simply having two compartments.) Jaynes advances theextraordinary theory that our remote ancestors heard ‘voices’ all the time, thereason being that—according to Jaynes—early man lacked all self-awareness in ourmodern sense of the word. Jaynes believes that our cave-man ancestors could notlook inside themselves and say: ‘Now let me think . . .’, because they had no‘inner me’. Their eyes were like a car’s headlamps, directed permanently towardsthe outside world. So if one of these men was ordered to go and build a dam downthe river, he would find it extremely difficult to remember why he was amblingalong the river bank. But his sense of purpose would be refreshed by a voice—thevoice of his chief—which seemed to come from the air above his head, and whichwould repeat his instructions.And where would such voices come from? According to Jaynes, from the right sideof the brain—the hemisphere which, as we have seen, houses the ‘other self’,Hudson’s ‘subjective mind’. If that is correct, it certainly offers a plausibleexplanation for the voice of Sarah’s grandmother and Susan’s father and Art’smother—in fact, in the latter case, it sounds far more convincing than thenotion that a living woman in Detroit could somehow ‘get inside’ her son’s headin distant Toronto.It is when Jaynes goes on to discuss the voices heard by mental patients thatcertain doubts begin to arise. He points out that most of the cases that havebeen studied involve schizophrenics, and says: ‘They converse, threaten, curse,criticise, consult, often in short sentences. They admonish, console, mock,command, or sometimes simply announce everything that’s happening. They yell,whine, sneer, and vary from the slightest whisper to a thunderous shout. Oftenthe voices take on some special peculiarity, such as speaking very slowly,scanning, rhyming, or in rhythms, or even foreign languages. There may be oneparticular voice, more often a few voices, and occasionally many . . .’The voices described by Crabtree do not sound in the least like this bewilderingbabble; they apparently conversed like any normal person. And the same appliesto the housewife who held long conversations with her grandmother as she wasmaking the beds. There is no reason, of course, why ‘phantom voices’ should notsound like those of a normal person; but it seems to be a fact that most of themdon’t.This is confirmed by a study made by another clinical psychologist, Dr WilsonVan Dusen, formerly of the Mendocino State Hospital in California. Van Dusenspent sixteen years observing the effect of hallucinations, and he describes hisfindings in a chapter called ‘The Presence of Spirits in Madness’ in his bookThe Presence of Other Worlds. His conclusions are, perhaps, even more startlingthan those of Julian Jaynes.Van Dusen explains that most patients who are hallucinating prefer to keep theirexperiences to themselves, since they know it will be taken as a proof that theyare mad. However, one unusually co-operative patient asked him if he would mindtalking directly with her hallucinations, and he did. Naturally, thehallucination could not answer Van Dusen direct: he had to ask the patient togive an account of what he could hear and see. But there was nothing to stop VanDusen addressing the hallucination directly. ‘In this way I could hold longdialogues with a patient’s hallucinations and record both my questions and theiranswers.’ And, like Adam Crabtree, he insists: ‘My method was that ofphenomenology. My only purpose was to describe the patient’s experiences asaccurately as possible. The reader may notice that I treat the hallucinations asrealities—that is what they are to the patient.’One consistent finding, says Van Dusen, was that the patients felt as if theyhad contact with another world or order of beings. ‘Most thought these otherpersons were living. All objected to the term “hallucination”.’‘For most individuals the hallucinations came on quite suddenly. One woman wasworking in the garden when an unseen man addressed her. Another man describedsudden loud noises and voices he heard when riding in a bus. Most werefrightened, and adjusted with difficulty to this new experience. All thepatients described voices as having the quality of a real voice, sometimeslouder, sometimes softer, than normal voices. The experience they described wasquite unlike thoughts or fantasies; when things are seen they appear fully real.For instance, a patient described being awakened one night by air force officerscalling him to the service of his country. He got up and was dressing when henoticed their insignia wasn’t quite right, then their faces altered. With thishe knew they were of the Other Order and struck one hard in the face. He hit thewall and injured his hand. He could not distinguish them from reality until henoticed the insignia . . .‘Most patients soon realise that they are having experiences that others do notshare, and for this reason learn to keep quiet about them. Many suffer insults,threats and attacks for years from voices with no one around them aware of it.’Perhaps Van Dusen’s most significant finding is that he learned that hispatients seemed to experience two distinct kinds of ‘voices’; he speaks of theseas the ‘higher order’ and the ‘lower order’:‘Lower order voices are similar to drunken bums at a bar who like to tease andtorment just for the fun of it. They suggest lewd acts and then scold thepatient for considering them. They find a weak point of conscience, and work onit interminably. For instance, one man heard voices teasing him for three yearsover a ten cent debt he had already paid. They call the patient everyconceivable name, suggest every lewd act, steal memories or ideas right out ofconsciousness, threaten death, and work on the patient’s credibility in everyway. For instance, they brag that they will produce some disaster on the morrowand then claim credit for one in the daily paper. They suggest foolish acts,such as raise your right hand in the air and stay that way, and tease if he doesit and threaten him if he doesn’t.’In fact, it seems clear that these ‘lower order’ hallucinations behave exactlylike bored children with nothing better to do.‘The vocabulary and range of ideas of the lower order is limited, but they havea persistent will to destroy. They invade every nook and cranny of privacy, workon every weakness and belief, claim awesome powers, make promises, and thenundermine the patient’s will . . .’‘A few ideas can be repeated endlessly. One voice just said ‘hey’ for monthswhile the patient tried to figure out whether ‘hey’ or ‘hay’ was meant. Evenwhen I was supposedly speaking to an engineer . . . the engineer was unable todo any more arithmetic than simple sums . . . The lower order voices seemincapable of sequential reasoning. Though they often claim to be in some distantcity, they cannot report more than the patient hears, sees or remembers. Theyseem imprisoned in the lowest level of the patient’s mind . . .’The ‘lower order’, then, are basically tormenters. But about one fifth of thehallucinations seem to be of a higher order, and they, on the other hand, seemconcerned with helping the patient. The ‘higher order’ is much more likely to besymbolic, religious, supportive, genuinely instructive; it can communicatedirectly with the inner feelings of the patient. It is similar to Jung’sarchetypes, whereas the ‘lower order’ is like Freud’s id. Van Dusen mentions acase of a gaspipe fitter who experienced a ‘higher-order’ hallucination of alovely woman who entertained him while showing him thousands of symbols: ‘. . .his female vision showed a knowledge of religion and myth far beyond thepatient’s comprehension.’ After Van Dusen had been holding a dialogue with this‘higher-order’ hallucination, the gaspipe fitter asked for just one clue to whatthey had been talking about.Van Dusen reports that he has been told by these ‘higher-order’ beings ‘that thepurpose of the lower order is to illuminate all of the person’s weaknesses’. Andthe purpose—or one of the purposes—of the ‘higher order’ seems to be to protectpeople against the ‘lower order’:‘This contrast may be illustrated by the experiences of one man. He had heardthe lower order arguing for a long while about how they would murder him. Healso had a light come to him at night, like the sun. He knew it was a differentorder because the light respected his freedom and would withdraw if itfrightened him. In contrast, the lower order worked against his will, and wouldattack if it could sense fear in him. This rarer higher order seldom speaks,whereas the lower order can talk endlessly.’While the ‘lower order’ ‘is consistently nonreligious and anti-religious’,jeering angrily at the least mention of religion, the ‘higher order’ ‘appearedstrangely gifted, sensitive, wise and religious’.Van Dusen made one extremely striking observation about the hallucinations.Although he was able to observe a very large number of them over the years, hesoon realised that ‘after 20 patients, there wasn’t much to be learned’ becausethe hallucinations were all so similar. This in itself seems baffling. Afterall, one would expect to find as many different types of hallucination as thereare people. For example, one might expect vets to have hallucinations that claimto be talking animals, engineers to be tormented by talking machines, gardenersto be haunted by talking plants or trees, librarians by talking books, dentistsby talking sets of false teeth. Nothing of the sort. The ‘lower-order’hallucinations were all strikingly similar; so were those of the ‘higher order’.This either implies some basic similarity in the part of our minds that createhallucinations, or something far stranger . . .Van Dusen is inclined to believe in something far stranger. Through his interestin ‘hypnagogic phenomena’—the odd dreams and visions we sometimes experience onthe edge of sleep—Van Dusen seems to have turned to the writings of EmanuelSwedenborg, whose Journal of Dreams is full of fascinating raw material for thepsychiatrist.Swedenborg described at some length what it was like to be ‘possessed’ byspirits, and Van Dusen was struck by the extraordinary similarity betweenSwedenborg’s accounts and the hallucinations described by patients in theMendocino State Hospital. Swedenborg says that spirits and angels can conversewith man directly by entering ‘by an internal way into his organ of hearing,thus affecting it from within’. Swedenborg goes on: ‘To speak with spirits atthis day is rarely granted because it is dangerous. . .’, which clearly seems toimply that there was some past age in which men could converse more directlywith ‘spirits’. The explanation Swedenborg gives is that spirits do not normallyknow ‘they are with man’, because there is a kind of barrier between theseentities and man’s own consciousness. If spirits get through this barrier—or areallowed through because a man has dabbled in ‘the occult’—they are likely tobecome a nuisance. ‘Evil spirits are such that they regard man with deadlyhatred, and desire nothing more than to destroy him, both body and soul.’Swedenborg also mentions that the barrier between spirits and humanconsciousness may be broken by people who ‘indulge much in fantasies, so as toremove themselves from the delights proper to the natural man’. This, says VanDusen, is a pretty good description of what we now call schizophrenia. (Weshould note that schizophrenia does not mean ‘split personality’—as the modernmisconception has it—but simply a withdrawal from reality.)‘All of Swedenborg’s observations on the effect of evil spirits entering man’sconsciousness conform to my findings,’ says Van Dusen. And he mentions passagesin Swedenborg in which the characteristics of the ‘lower order’ are described:their determination to destroy a man, their ability to cause anxiety or pain,their desire to destroy conscience, their hatred of religion, their tendency tobully, threaten, deceive and lie, and their curious skill at mimicry. All thesecharacteristics of the ‘lower order’, as experienced by mental patients, arespecifically described in the writings of Swedenborg. Van Dusen was particularlystruck by their hatred of religion. ‘If voices are merely the patient’sunconscious coming forth, I would have no reason to expect them to beparticularly for or against religion. Yet the lower order can be counted on togive its most scurrilous comments to any suggestion of religion.’ Swedenborgalso notes the obsession of the ‘lower order’ with filth and obscenity, anotherpoint noted by Van Dusen.Van Dusen also observed that although the lower order claim to be individuals,they seldom reveal any trace of real personal identity. Swedenborg explains thatthe personal memory is taken from them at death, so they are forced to rely onthe memory and abilities of the person they are ‘possessing’. Another strikingsimilarity between Swedenborg’s spirits and the ‘lower order’ is the attempt topossess some organ or part of the patient’s body. ‘Several worked on onepatient’s ear, and he seemed to grow deafer. One voice worked for two years tocapture a patient’s eye, which went visibly out of alignment.’ They often setout to possess the genitals. ‘One female patient described her sexual relationswith her male spirit as both more pleasurable and more inward than normalintercourse.’There is an equally striking correspondence between the ‘higher order’ describedby mental patients and the entities Swedenborg calls ‘angels’. The angels arekind, helpful and wise. The reason that they are so sparing of words is thatman’s ‘interior mind’ does not think in words, but in ‘universals which comprisemany particulars’—that is to say, in intuitive insights. They are, in short, aright-brain function. Or, to put it another way, ‘angels’ communicate throughthe right cerebral hemisphere, and prefer symbols—we may recollect Van Dusen’sgaspipe fitter who was shown hundreds of universal symbols in an hour by his‘higher order’ mentor. Swedenborg also notes that ‘higher order’ spirits can seethe lower ones, but not vice versa—which again corresponded to Van Dusen’s ownexperience.Van Dusen was inclined to wonder why ‘higher-order’ hallucinations are so muchrarer than those of the ‘lower order’ (approximately one fifth as many).Swedenborg suggests an answer. Angels, he says, possess the very interior ofman, and their ‘influx is tacit’. So they are simply less apparent than thehostile spirits, who make sure their presence is recognised. What are we to makeof all this? Both Crabtree and Van Dusen insist that they try to function solelyas observers, implying that the reader can choose which explanation heprefers—spirits or the unconscious mind. But we have seen that Van Dusen isinclined to wonder why, if the ‘lower order’ is merely the patient’sunconscious, they should show such consistent hostility to religion. And how canwe explain the following story from Crabtree’s book? An acquaintance ofCrabtree’s called Pat was invited by a girlfriend to spend a weekend at hergrandparents’ farm. The grandparents turned out to be dabblers in the occult,and parts of the house, such as the attic, gave Pat peculiar feelings ofuneasiness. Later, the grandparents suggested that Pat should try automaticwriting, which she did with some misgivings. The moment she took the pen in herhand and relaxed, she slipped into a drugged, trance-like state, and experienceda numbness in her hand and arm. She seemed to see a woman who appeared behindher; the woman had a doll-like face, and wore a long mauve gown. Pat felt asthough her energies were being usurped by this woman, and suddenly her handwrote: ‘Elizabeth Barrett Browning here.’ (Her hosts had earlier mentionedElizabeth Barrett Browning.) There followed a long message which included theinformation that Mrs Browning and Robert were having difficulty getting used totheir ‘new surroundings’. Slowly, the energy seemed to diminish until thewriting stopped. But Pat felt oddly dissociated for the rest of the day.Later that evening a second session was held. This time several different‘entities’ used Pat’s hand to write, and the messages were of a ‘coarse nature’.At a third session, ‘Mrs Browning’ answered the question ‘Where do you livenow?’ ‘Everywhere . . . nowhere. We are you and you are us.’ After that sheseemed to become very cagey.Then the handwriting changed to that of Pat’s deceased brother Tom, and therewas a message of love and comfort. But when Pat said how moved she felt, hergirlfriend snapped: ‘That wasn’t Tom. They’ll pretend to be anyone.’ Evidentlyshe knew a great deal about ‘lower-order’ entities.Later, one of the grandparents remarked that some entity no longer seemed to bein the house; it had left because it was attracted to Pat’s aura. Pat wasdisturbed at the thought that she had been used as a kind of sponge to soak upsome dubious force.Back home again, Pat began to hear ‘Elizabeth’ ’s voice inside her head, and shefelt oddly detached from reality. ‘Elizabeth’ tried to persuade her to do moreautomatic writing, but she felt that if she did this, she would only beconsolidating the ‘spirit’s’ hold. ‘We need you’, said ‘Elizabeth’. ‘If yourefuse to speak to us we shall live in your room, in your walls.’Pat’s girlfriend had told her that if she ignored the entity, it would soon goaway. She found that it was not as easy as that. She tried reading a trashynovel and ignoring the voice, but a sensation that someone was pressing her faceagainst her own made it hard to concentrate. In bed she tossed and turned soviolently that she had to remake the bed several times. But she felt that her‘starvation’ technique was the right one. After a few days, her ability toconcentrate began to return; slowly, little by little, the influence of theentities (for she felt there was more than one) began to diminish. Finally, shehad the impression that she could actually see the woman in the mauve dressreceding, turning first into a mauve mass, then into a ‘low grade vibration’.Pat may have been very suggestible, and her unconscious mind may have createdthe woman in mauve, but it must be admitted that this explanation seems lessconvincing than the alternative—that Pat had willingly opened herself to one ofthe ‘lower order’, and had to extricate herself as best she could. Descriptionsof this type of possession are familiar in ‘occult’ literature. The Americanresearcher Alan Vaughan describes how he himself became ‘possessed’ for a time.He had bought himself a ouija board, to amuse a friend who was convalescing.Soon he was receiving all kinds of messages, some of which seemed to conveyinformation that was not available to Vaughan’s own unconscious mind—forexample, when the radio announced the death of the newspaper columnist DorothyKilgallen, from a heart attack, they asked the board if this was true; itreplied that she had actually died of poison. Ten days later, this proved to betrue. (It was suspected—and still is—that she died because she knew too muchabout the John F. Kennedy assassination.) Then, to his alarm, Vaughan found thata spirit who called itself ‘Nada’ (‘nothing’—recalling ‘Elizabeth’ ‘s answer tothe question about where she lived) had ‘got inside his head’. ‘I could hear hervoice repeating the same phrases over and over again’—in the typical manner ofthe ‘lower order’. When asked about this, the board replied: ‘Awfulconsequences—possession.’A friend who understood such matters undertook to help Vaughan, and another‘spirit’ took possession of his hand and made him write a message: ‘Each of ushas a spirit while living. Do not meddle with the spirits of the dead.’ Then thespirit seemed to cause an uprising of energy in Vaughan’s body which pushed both‘Nada’ and the helpful entity out of the top of Vaughan’s head:‘I felt a tremendous sense of elation and physical wellbeing . . . My mind beganto race in some extended dimension that knew no confines of time or space. Forthe first time, I began to sense what was going on in other people’s minds, and,to my astonishment, I began to sense the future through some kind of extendedawareness . . .’1Here again, we can see that Vaughan’s account seems to tally closely with whatSwedenborg had to say about angels and spirits. ‘Nada’ repeated the same phrasesover and over again, as the ‘lower order’ always do. She identified herself asthe wife of a Nantucket sea captain, and Vaughan remarks that she seemed toresent the fact that he was alive and she was dead. The entity that helped topush ‘Nada’ out of Vaughan’s head sounds very much like one of Swedenborg’sangels.But could not both entities have been a product of Vaughan’s ‘right brain’, asJulian Jaynes suggests? This is conceivable; yet again, there does seem to be adistinction between the manifestations of the right brain, and ‘lower order’entities. The right brain is the intuitive self—the aspect of us that providesinsight and ‘inspiration’—such as the tunes that ‘walked into’ Mozart’s head. Ithas better things to do than repeat the same stupid phrase over and over again.The distinction can be seen clearly in a case I have described elsewhere,2 thatof Brad Absetz, an American teacher living in Finland, who accidentally stumbledupon the trick of establishing contact with his ‘other self. After the death oftheir child from cancer, Brad Absetz’s wife retreated into a state ofschizophrenia. For hours at a time, she would lie on the bed, her eyes closed,struggling with guilt and depression. Brad would lie there beside her, waitingfor her to emerge from these sessions of gloomy introspection so he couldcomfort and encourage her. He lay totally alert, waiting for the slightestmovement that would indicate that she was returning to normal awareness. Yetclearly, a man who lies on a bed for hours at a time will drift into a state ofrelaxation. One day, as he lay there in this combined state of relaxation andalertness, he experienced a curious sense of inner freedom, of release from thebody, almost as if floating clear of the bed. Then he noticed an impulse in themuscles of his arm, as if it wanted to move. Brad mentally gave his arm‘permission to move’, and it floated up into the air. Soon both arms were makingspontaneous movements, while he looked on as a bystander.In the dining hall, where buffet meals were served, his hands showed adisposition to select food for themselves; for several weeks, he allowed them toselect the food they preferred—it was seldom what he would have chosenhimself—and noticed that he began to lose weight, and to feel fitter than everbefore. His ‘hand’ later used crayons and paints to create an extraordinaryseries of paintings, and to make metal sculptures. It also began to write poemsin free-verse form, and these poems were remarkable for a certain clarity andpurity of language.What had happened is that the right-brain self had begun to express itself; wemight say that in the parliament of his mind, the member for the unconscious hadworked up the courage to start making speeches. Psychologists refer to the rightbrain as the ‘non-dominant hemisphere’; in most of us, it behaves like asuppressed housewife who never dares to utter her own opinion. Brad’s hours ofquiescence had taught her to overcome her shyness.One day when he took up a pencil to allow his hand to write, the handwriting wasquite different from his own. A woman named herself and briefly introducedherself. Brad’s immediate reaction was a powerful sense of rejection. He pushedthe paper away, and said forcefully: ‘I will not be a mouthpiece for anyone butmyself.’ The ‘communicator’ went away and did not return. Here we seem to have aclear distinction between the ‘voice’ of the right brain and some externalcommunicator or spirit.In short, whether we accept it or not, it seems there is a prima facie case forthe existence of disembodied entities that can, under certain circumstances,‘get inside the heads’ of human beings. When this happens ‘by invitation’—thatis, when the human being goes into a trance and allows himself—or herself—to beused by the entity, it is known as mediumship. When it happens involuntarily, asin the case of Alan Vaughan, it is known as possession.The case that first drew Adam Crabtree’s attention to the phenomenon dated fromthe last decade of the 19th century, and had been described in a pamphlet calledBegone Satan, by the Rev. Carl Vogel. In 1896, a 14-year-old Wisconsin girlnamed Anna Ecklund began to be troubled by a desire to commit what sheconsidered ‘unspeakable sexual acts’, and by an inability to enter Catholicchurches, complicated by a desire to attack holy objects. Her problems wereignored for sixteen years, then Reisinger, a Capuchin monk from the nearbycommunity of St Anthony at Marathon, performed an exorcism which brought relief.But it was only temporary. In 1928—when Anna was 46—he decided to try again,this time at the convent of Earling, Iowa. The results of the 23-day exorcismwere spectacular, and many of the nuns were so exhausted by the appallinggoings-on that they had to be transferred to another convent.Before the exorcism began, a number of the strongest nuns held Anna down on thebed. But as soon as Reisinger began to speak, Anna’s body shot up into the airand landed high up on the wall, apparently holding on ‘with catlike grip’. Shewas dragged down to the bed again, and as soon as Reisinger began again, beganto howl and screech so loudly that people in the street ran to the convent tofind out what was happening. Then various ‘demons’ spoke through the girl indifferent voices, although her mouth did not move. Her face became twisted, andher whole body contorted into extraordinary positions. Her head swelled andbecame bright red. She also vomited large quantities of ‘foul matter’.She also displayed another common phenomenon of possession: speaking inlanguages of which she had no conscious knowledge; when the exorcist spoke inGerman or Latin, she would reply in the same language. When food was sprinkledsurreptitiously with holy water, she knew it instantly.A ‘demon’ who identified himself as Beelzebub told the exorcist that he and hiscohorts had been invited to enter the girl by her father, who had beeninfuriated by her rejection of his attempts at incest. The exorcist succeeded in‘summoning’ the father, who confirmed this story. His common-law wife also spokethrough Anna’s mouth, and admitted to killing four of her babies (she wasprobably referring to abortions). During all this time, Anna herself was‘unconscious’, so in fact the spirits were speaking through her as through amedium.During the course of the exorcism, the pastor was involved in a strange caraccident. And on the twenty-third day, Anna’s body shot erect off the bed sothat only her heels remained in contact. Then she collapsed on her knees, and aterrible voice repeated the names of the departing spirits, until it seemed todie away in the distance. As a kind of parting shot, the room filled with anappalling stench. At this point, Anna opened her eyes and smiled.Crabtree interviewed the monk who had translated Vogel’s pamphlet into English,and who was able to confirm the details. So when he encountered the case ofSarah Worthington, he found it easier to accept that he was dealing with a caseof ‘possession’.In fact, Crabtree insists that he merely accepts possession as a workinghypothesis—a hypothesis that happens, in fact, to work. He is saying, in effect,that his cases might really involve some strange, complex activity of theunconscious—like ‘multiple personality’—but that by treating it as possession,he can cure his patients.But Ralph Allison, another psychiatrist whose work interested Crabtree, had beenforced to go a step further. In 1972, Allison was treating a mousy little womancalled Janette, who experienced impulses to kill her husband and children. Whenanother psychiatrist expressed the view that Janette was a case of dualpersonality, Allison asked her to relax deeply (in effect, into a semi-hypnoticstate) and asked to speak to the ‘other person’. Immediately, a harsh, gratingvoice that identified itself as ‘Lydia’ remarked: ‘God, it’s good to be rid ofthat piss-ass Janette’. Like Gibert’s patient Leonie in Le Havre, Janetteclearly had a hostile alter-ego.Allison came to the interesting and perceptive conclusion that Janette wassimply too passive, and that if she became a more active person, Lydia wouldgradually vanish. And now—as in the Leonie case—a third and altogether morebalanced personality also emerged (identifying heself as Karen). Allison came torefer to such personalities as the ‘inner self-helper’. And with Karen’shelp—and Janette’s efforts to be a less passive person—Allison was able toeffect a cure. In this case, he was undoubtedly dealing with a case of multiplepersonality.In this case, the basic hypothesis of multiple personality covered thefacts—that a traumatic childhood had caused the ‘prime personality’ to withdrawfrom the problems of life, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand. ButAllison’s next patient, a girl called Carrie, forced him to take the‘possession’ hypothesis seriously. Carrie was another ‘multiple’ with a historyof childhood traumas, including a gang rape. Even without hypnosis, an alter-egocalled Wanda emerged and talked to Allison. But it seemed clear that Wanda wasnot responsible for the suicidal impulses. When told that a ‘psychic’ claimedthat Carrie was possessed by the spirit of a drug addict who had died of anoverdose in New York in 1968, Allison decided to ‘give the concept of spiritpossession a try’. Under deep hypnosis, Carrie agreed that the drug-addict wasinfluencing her life, and Allison’s makeshift ‘exorcism’—using a swingingcrystal ball on a chain—apparently succeeded. Then Allison tried ‘exorcising’Wanda, and was again apparently successful. Unfortunately, the treatment stillfailed to dislodge two other personalities, and Carrie eventually committedsuicide.Yet Allison continued to reject the notion of ‘spirit possession’ until heencountered a girl called Elise, who revealed several personalities underhypnosis. Most of these were able to describe their history—what trauma hadcaused them to be ‘born’. But one of them claimed to be a man called Dennis, whoexplained that he had entered Elise’s body when she was experimenting with blackmagic as a teenager, and that he enjoyed remaining there because he liked havingsex with another of Elise’s personalities, a girl called Shannon. The sex wasnot, as might be supposed, a bodiless intercourse between two ‘spirits’: whenShannon took over Elise’s body, and had sex with a man, Dennis would enter theman’s body. And although Elise and Shannon shared the same body, Dennis was notinterested in sex with Elise, only with Shannon. Eventually, with the help ofanother ‘inner self-helper’, Elise was cured. It was this case that finallyconvinced Allison that multiple personality may sometimes be a case of spiritpossession.It was William Blatty’s book The Exorcist—and the film based on it—that caused aflood of popular books and articles on exorcism. The case took place in aWashington suburb, Mount Rainier, in 1949.13-year-old Douglass Deen was the ‘focus’ of the occurrences, which began with ascratching noise in the walls. A rat extermination company was able to find nosign of rats or mice. The sounds occurred only when Douglass was near by. Thenmore usual poltergeist phenomena began to occur: dishes flew through the air,fruit was hurled against the wall. A picture floated off the wall, hovered inthe air, then went back to its old position. After this, Douglass’s bed began toshake and quiver when he was in it.The family asked the local minister, the Reverend M. Winston, for help, and onFebruary 17, 1949 Douglass spent the night in his home. The two retired to aroom with twin beds. Douglass’s bed soon began to vibrate, and there werescratching noises in the walls. Winston asked Douglass to sleep in an armchair.The chair slid over to the wall, then slowly tilted until it threw the boy onthe floor. The minister improvised a bed on the floor; as soon as Douglass wasin it, the bed slid across the room.As these events continued, the boy was taken to two hospitals—Georgetown and StLouis University, both Jesuit institutions. All attempts to treat him medicallyand psychiatrically were unsuccessful. Finally, a Jesuit priest undertook theexorcism. He fasted for two and a half months on bread and water, and repeatedthe ritual of exorcism no fewer than thirty times. The ‘spirit’ showed itsobjection to these rituals—or perhaps its contempt—by sending the boy intoconvulsions, making him scream obscenities and blasphemies in a shrill voice,and sometimes making him reply to the exorcism in Latin—a language he had neverstudied. Finally, in May 1949, the phenomena ceased; the thirtieth exorcism wasapparently successful. But then, as we have seen, most poltergeist phenomenalast only a month or so; it may have gone away of its own accord.Here, then, we have a case of poltergeist disturbances that turned into‘demoniacal possession’, with all the phenomena that occurred in the Louduncase. The ‘psychological’ explanation would be that Douglass Deen’s ‘other self’began by producing poltergeist disturbances, then took up the game of demonicpossession suggested by the Jesuit fathers. (His ability to speak Latin is notas surprising as it sounds; he must have heard a great deal of Latin during hislife—at mass—and may have picked it up unconsciously.) But Kardec’s explanationabout a mischievous spirit fits equally well. If Kardec is correct, then thephysical changes that occur during puberty cause a ‘leakage’ of a certain typeof energy that can be used by a poltergeist; this energy is probably some formof nerve-force. When the physical adjustments of puberty have been made, theleak stops, and the poltergeist can no longer manifest itself.Why did a poltergeist invade the Deen family home? In the film of The Exorcist,a reason is provided: the daughter of the house plays with a ouija board. Thereis no evidence that this happened in the Deen case, but it is certainlyconsistent with what we know about poltergeists—we may recall the Phelps case(Chapter 6 [../Text/11_chapter06.html]), which started when the Rev. Phelpsbegan trying to contact ‘spirits’.All this sounds thoroughly alarming, and may worry people of nervousdisposition. But a number of points should be borne in mind. Spirits, accordingto Swedenborg, have no power to actually ‘invade’ the body—or mind—of a normalperson. If they manage to do so because they are more-or-less invited—as in thecase of Crabtree’s patient Pat, who became hostess to ‘Elizabeth BarrettBrowning’—the sitting tenant is at a basic advantage, as a householder isencountering a squatter. Pat’s determined refusal to encourage her ‘squatter’finally had the desired effect, and ‘Elizabeth’ went away.The conclusion is straightforward. The fact that ‘possession’ can actually occuris no more alarming than the fact that black holes exist. It merely indicatesthat the universe is a stranger and more complex place than ourgreat-grandparents assumed. But then, even our great-grandparents knew that itis better to be acquainted with facts than to be ignorant of them.Postscript: A Note on Reincarnation.The case of Lurancy Vennum and Mary Roff, cited at the beginning of thischapter, raises another important question. The account is consistent with theteaching of Allen Kardec who—as we have seen—asserts the reality ofreincarnation in The Spirits’ Book. It is also consistent with Kardec’s viewthat the body is merely a vehicle which, like any other vehicle, might be usedby more than one driver.Reincarnation, the notion that we return to earth many times, is a part of thereligious belief of Hindus and Buddhists. Some of the most convincing accountsof reincarnation come from India.In the early 1930s the case of a girl called Shanti Devi excited worldwideattention. Kumari Shanti Devi was born in Delhi on October 12, 1926, and, whenshe was 4, she began to talk about a town called Muttra, a hundred miles away.She claimed that she had lived there in a yellow house, and that her husband hadbeen a man called Kedar Nath Chaubey. The principal of the local school was sointrigued by all this that he examined Shanti, and asked where her husbandlived; Shanti gave him an address. The principal wrote to Kedar Nath, and to hisastonishment received a reply verifying that he was a widower, whose wife—a girlcalled Ludgi—had died ten years earlier. He confirmed in detail many things thatShanti had related.However, a hundred miles was a long way to travel, so Kedar Nath wrote to acousin in Delhi and asked him to call on Shanti Devi’s family.The cousin, Kanji Mal, arrived at the door, and was instantly recognized byShanti. He went away totally convinced. The result was that Kedar Nath hurriedto Delhi. Shanti, wildly excited, flung herself into his arms. She then answeredin detail all kinds of questions about her life with him. All Kedar’s doubtsvanished. This was undoubtedly his former wife. But what on earth could he doabout it? He could hardly take a 10-year-old girl back to his home . . . So, sadand perplexed, he returned to Muttra. A few days later, Shanti was taken toMuttra by her parents, together with three scientific investigators. And fromthe moment she arrived, no one had the slightest doubt that she was genuine.Among the crowd on the station platform she recognized an elderly man as herbrother-in-law. Then, in a carriage, she directed the driver, and showed anintimate knowledge of the town—also pointing out a number of houses that hadbeen built since she died. She directed the carriage to the house in which shehad lived with Kedar, then to another house into which they had moved later. Sheled them to an old well, which had now been filled in, and showed the spot inone of the rooms where she had buried a hundred rupees in the earth floor. Themen dug, and found only an empty jewel-box—at which point Kedar Nath admittedwith embarrassment that he had found the box and spent the money. Later, Shantirecognized her former parents and her brother in the crowd. All this was placedon record, and caused such a stir that it was reported in newspapers all overthe world.Cases like that of Shanti Devi—and there were many others—were studied byProfessor Hemendra Banerjee of Rajasthan University. And in America Dr IanStevenson of the University of Virginia began an exhaustive scientific study ofsuch cases, his first results being published in 1966 under the cautious titleof Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation. His cases come from India, Ceylon(now Sri Lanka), Brazil and Alaska, and all are full of documented evidence. Asingle one will give a sample of his astonishing material.In 1954 a 3-year-old boy called Jasbir Lal Jat died of smallpox. Before he couldbe buried the next day, the corpse stirred and revived. It was some weeks beforethe child could speak, but when he did his parents were astonished that hispersonality had changed completely. He announced that he was the son of aBrahmin family (a higher caste than his ‘present’ family) who lived in thevillage of Vehedi, and he refused to eat food unless it was cooked by a Brahmin.He said that he had been poisoned by some doctored sweets, and had fallen off acart, smashed his skull and died. Jasbir’s family were, understandably,sceptical, assuming that his illness had affected his mind. But they began toreconsider in 1957 when a Brahmin lady from Vehedi came to Jasbir’s village, andhe instantly recognized her as his aunt. Jasbir was taken back to Vehedi and,like Shanti Devi, led the party round the village, showing a detailed knowledgeof its lay-out, and recognized members of his family. His name, in his previousexistence, had been Sobha Ram. The accusation about the poisoned sweets wasnever satisfactorily cleared up—Sobha Ram was said to have died of smallpox—butDr Stevenson’s detailed account leaves no doubt that Jasbir knew too much aboutVehedi and the life of Sobha Ram for any deception to have taken place.The oddest point about this case, of course, is that Jasbir was already threeand a half when he ‘died’, and was taken over by the ‘spirit’ of Sobha Ram—whodied at the same time. The logical explanation, therefore, would seem to be thatJasbir really died, and that the spirit of Sobha Ram grabbed the body before‘brain death’ occurred and fought his way back to life. This raises somefascinating questions about the whole relation between spirit and matter, lifeand death . . .Stevenson points out that most of the really convincing cases of reincarnationtake place in cultures that already accept reincarnation as a fact. This, as wehave already seen, is not always so. In 1910 a 5-year-old girl named AlexandrinaSamona died in Palermo, Sicily, and her mother was wild with grief. Soon after,she had a dream in which her dead child assured her that she would return in theform of a baby. Later that year Adela Samona gave birth to twins, one of whomwas the double of Alexandrina, and who was therefore given her name. (The otherwas a totally different personality.) When the new Alexandrina was ten, hermother took her on an outing to the town of Monreale, where Alexandrina hadnever been before. Yet the child insisted that she had. She described variousthings she had seen in the town, and said that she had been there with hermother and a woman with ‘horns’ on her forehead—whereupon Signora Samonarecalled that a few months before the death of the first Alexandrina they hadbeen to Monreale, accompanied by a neighbour who had unsightly cysts on herforehead. Other details recalled by Alexandrina also proved correct. This casegave rise to widespread interest, and was reported together with lengthydepositions of everyone concerned, leaving little doubt about the basic accuracyof the facts.In recent years there has been a steadily increasing interest in reincarnation,dating from 1956 when a book entitled The Search for Bridey Murphy became abest-seller. A hypnotist named Morey Bernstein placed a Colorado housewife,Virginia Tighe, in a trance, and asked her questions about the period before shewas born (a technique known as ‘regression’). Mrs Tighe declared that in the19th century she had been an Irish girl named Bridey Murphy, who lived inCork—she gave extremely detailed information about her life there. The casecaused a sensation, which collapsed abruptly when an American newspaper ran an‘exposé’, declaring that Mrs Tighe had had an Irish aunt who told her endlessstories about Ireland, and that as a child she had lived opposite a woman calledBridey Corkell, with whose son she was in love. . . . Yet on closerinvestigation it is impossible to dismiss the Bridey Murphy case as unconsciousself-deception. To begin with, the newspaper that did the exposé was the onethat had failed to gain the serial rights on Bernstein’s book, which had gone toa rival. It emerged that Virginia had never met her ‘Irish aunt’ until she waseighteen, and that she was certainly never in love with Mrs Corkell’s son—whoturned out to be the editor of the Sunday edition of the newspaper thatdenounced her. But the general public are not interested in such fine points asthese; as far as they were concerned, Bridey Murphy had been proved to be afake.Other hypnotists, like Arnall Bloxham (an Englishman) and Joe Keeton, began totry the techniques of ‘regression’, and produced astonishing information thatseemed to prove that patients could recall their ‘past lives’. One of Bloxham’ssubjects gave an impressive account of being a naval gunner at the time ofNelson; while another, a housewife, recalled many past lives, including one ofbeing a Jewess involved in an anti-semitic pogrom in York. Her knowledge ofancient history proved to be astonishingly detailed (as Jeffrey Iverson hasrecounted in his book More Lives than One?). A professor identified the churchshe had described—in the crypt of which the hunted Jews took refuge—as StMary’s, the only problem being that St Mary’s had no crypt. A few months later,workmen renovating the church discovered the crypt.Now book after book appeared with powerful evidence for reincarnation. In TheCathars and Reincarnation, Dr Arthur Guirdham described a patient called ‘MrsSmith’ who had dreams and visions of being alive in 13th-century France, as amember of a persecuted sect called the Cathars, who were finally exterminated bythe Inquisition. Guirdham had himself been interested in the Cathars because hehad also had strange dreams about them. Now, stimulated by Mrs Smith’s detailed‘dream knowledge’ of the period, he investigated Catharism with the aid ofFrench scholars, and found that she was correct again and again; when she andscholars disagreed, it was usually she who turned out to be correct. In SecondTime Round Edward Ryall described in detail memories of a previous existence asa West-Country farmer who lived during the reign of Charles II and took part inthe battle of Sedgemoor. In Lives to Remember, Peter Underwood and LeonardWilder described hypnotic experiments with a housewife, Peggy Bailey, anddetailed memories of three of her previous lives.Yet obviously the problem here is one of how far we can accept the evidence ofpeople who have become convinced that reincarnation is a reality. To manysceptics Arthur Guirdham’s case is undermined by his admission that he was alsoa Cathar in a previous existence, and—by a strange coincidence—the lover of theprevious Mrs Smith. The reader of A. J. Stewart’s Died 1513, Born 1929 is boundto experience a certain incredulity to learn that, in her previous existence,Miss Stewart was James II of Scotland.In 1981 the sceptics found a formidable champion in Ian Wilson, whose book MindOut of Time? is a devastating analysis of some of the cases of reincarnation. Imyself am quoted approvingly because of an experiment I conducted on BBCtelevision in which a housewife was made to hallucinate as an evil clergyman bymeans of post-hypnotic suggestion. Wilson goes on to show how easily ourunconscious minds can deceive us, citing many cases in which people haveconvinced themselves that long-buried memories of some book they once read areactually memories of past lives. He points out, for example, that the man whothought he had been a gunner in one of Nelson’s ships had read C. S. Forester’sHornblower novels as a child and could easily have picked up his ‘facts’ fromthem. His final considered assessment is that most cases of reincarnation areactually examples of the strange psychological illness known as ‘multiplepersonality’.Wilson’s scepticism is salutary and bracing. But the book suffers from thedefect of most attempts to ‘explode’ a particular belief: it seems to ignoresome of the most convincing evidence. Anyone who is interested in reincarnationimmediately turns to the index to see what he makes of the Lurancy Vennumcase—and discovers that, for some odd reason, he does not even mention it.Discussing Stevenson’s cases, he objects that so many involve young children,and points out that children often fantasise about being somebody else. But heonly has one brief and indirect reference to the astonishing case of Jasbir LalJat, and prefers to pick holes and find minor errors in less well-documentedcases.And then Wilson seriously undermines his own arguments by citing one of the mostremarkable cases of recent years—that of the Pollock twins. In May 1975 twosisters—Joanna and Jacqueline Pollock, aged 11 and 6—were killed by a car thatmounted the pavement. In October 1958 Mrs Pollock had female twins, who werecalled Jennifer and Gillian. Jennifer had a scar on her forehead in exactly theplace her dead sister Jacqueline had had one. When the twins were only fourmonths old, the family moved away from Hexham to Whitley Bay. But when the twinswere taken back three years later, they behaved as if they had known it alltheir lives, recognizing the school, the playground and the old house wheretheir sisters had lived. When Mrs Pollock decided to open a locked cupboard inwhich she had kept the dead children’s toys, the twins immediately recognisedthem item by item, naming all the dolls. One day Mrs Pollock was shocked to findthem playing a game in which one twin cradled the other’s head saying, ‘Theblood’s coming out of your eyes. That’s where the car hit you.’ But the Pollockshad been careful never to tell their children anything about how their sistershad died.So although Mr Wilson points out that the evidence is by no meanswatertight—because John Pollock himself believes in reincarnation—he leaves mostreaders with the impression that it is quite strong enough for any reasonableperson. And when, at the end of his discussion of the Bridey Murphy case, headmits reluctantly: ‘. . . when the dubious and the downright spurious has beendiscarded, there remain signs of some not yet understood phenomenon at work,’most readers will be inclined to wonder why he considers himself a sceptic. 1. See article on ‘The Curse of the Pharaohs’ in my Encyclopedia of UnsolvedMysteries, volume one.1. Alan Vaughan: Patterns of Prophecy, 1973, p. 4[../Text/06_chapter01.html#page_4].2. Access to Inner Worlds: The Story of Brad Absetz, 1983."},{"pageContent":"12Magicians and Wonder WorkersIT WOULD BE A mistake to think of the magician as the male form of the witch.(In fact, the word ‘witch’ can apply to both men and women.) But in the longoccult tradition, the magician is distinguished from the witch by his desire toachieve intellectual mastery over the principles of nature. Magicians likeParacelsus and Cornelius Agrippa regarded themselves as scientists rather thanas sorcerers—as becomes clear from Lynn Thorndike’s vast History of Magic andExperimental Science, in which there is no attempt to distinguish one from theother.But what also becomes very clear from the history of magic is that most of the‘great magicians’ were driven by another motive: the desire for personal fameand power. And, more often than not, this has been their downfall.In primitive tribal societies, the magician was indistinguishable from thewitch. We have seen—in the chapter on witches—how modern tribal shamans—likethose described in F. Bruce Lamb’s Wizard of the Upper Amazon—are actually ableto lure animals into the area where hunters are waiting for them. And thereseems no reason to doubt that the shamans depicted by our Cro-magnon ancestorsin their cave paintings were able to do the same thing.Slowly, over the course of many thousands of years, the tribal shaman evolvedinto the modern sorcerer. That is, he ceased to be what is called a whitewitch—a benevolent and helpful worker of magic—and became more interested inobtaining power for himself. We can see this transformation beginning in the OldTestament prophets such as Moses, Joshua, Elijah, and Daniel. It is true thatthey are men of God, and that their power apparently comes from God. But it issignificant how often they are engaged in magical contests in which theydemonstrate their power at the expense of competing magicians. Aaron throws downhis rod in front of the Pharaoh and it turns into a snake. The rival Egyptianmagicians do the same thing and their rods also become snakes. But Aaron’s snakeeats up all the other snakes. Elijah challenges four hundred and fifty priestsof Baal to a test of magic in which they are to call on their god to light thefire under a sacrificial bullock. Their god fails them. Elijah, with greatdramatic flair, tells his people to drench his bullock and firewood with waterthree times. Then he calls upon Jehovah. The God of the Jews sends down a firethat consumes the bullock, the wood, and the water. After this, Elijah ordersthe people to kill all the priests of Baal. The will to power swaggers throughthe whole story.The desire to dominate, to assert themselves, to humiliate or destroy those whooppose them is something that can be observed again and again in the lives ofthe great magicians. Moreover, the magical contest—the battle with a rival—is astandard feature of the lives of the magicians. In the 1st century AD the Greekmagician Apollonius of Tyana engaged in a contest with a rival named Euphrates.Simon Magus, the magician of Samaria referred to in the Acts of the Apostles,was supposed to have been challenged by St. Peter. The legend is that Simonconjured up huge black hounds that rushed at Peter.The apostle held out a loaf of holy bread, and the hounds vanished into thinair. In one version of the legend, Simon then rose into the air, hovered for amoment, and flew through a window. Peter fell to his knees and prayed, whereuponSimon plummeted to the ground. He died from his injuries in this fall.There can be no doubt that many such stories are pure invention. Others,however, are too detailed—and too widely reported—to be wholly invented. Theinteresting question is: What genuine powers did men such as Simon Maguspossess? The account of him given in the Acts of the Apostles is,understandably, belittling. Describing himself as ‘some great one,’ Simonangered St. Peter by offering him money in exchange for the gift of the HolySpirit. Christian documents are inclined to regard Simon as a charlatan. Heclaimed to be able to make himself invisible, change himself into an animal, andwalk unharmed through fire. The Christians said that all this was achieved bybewitching the senses of the onlookers. Modern writers have taken this to meanthat he used some form of hypnosis. For example, legend says that when Simonwent to Rome, Nero ordered him to be decapitated by one of his officers. Simon,however, bewitched the officer into decapitating a ram instead. When hereappeared with his head still on his shoulders, Nero was so impressed by hispowers that he made Simon his court magician.But was Simon’s means of control over the officer ordinary hypnosis or was itthe kind of Psi power exercised by Wolf Messing (see p. 54[../Text/07_chapter02.html#page_54]) when he induced the bank clerk to hand overten thousand roubles. The latter is altogether more likely, because hypnosisusually takes the co-operation of the person about to be hypnotised. It isunlikely that Simon was able to make himself invisible or turn himself into ananimal. But he certainly seemed to have command of the power of thoughtpressure, just as some people are born with a green thumb.At this point, it is time to raise the question of how such a power could work.Let us look more closely at some of the recorded examples.The poet W. B. Yeats was a member of the order of the Golden Dawn, one of thefirst and best known occult societies of late 19th century England. In hisautobiography Yeats describes an incident that occurred on a walk taken by oneof the other Golden Dawn members and MacGregor Mathers, one of the order’sfounders. ‘Look at those sheep,’ said Mathers. ‘I am going to imagine myself aram.’ The sheep immediately began to run after him.Mathers could also use his strange powers on people, just as the Swedishplaywright August Strindberg believed he himself could. Once when Strindberg waseating alone in a restaurant, he recognised two friends among some drunk peopleat another table. To his dismay, one of them began to approach him. Strindbergfixed his eyes on the man. At this, the friend looked bewildered and returned tohis table apparently convinced that Strindberg was a stranger.Strindberg once attempted to practise black magic, and he believed that hislater suffering and bad luck was a result of this dabbling with evil forces. Itwas when he was separated from his second wife. He wanted desperately to bringabout a reconciliation, and had to think of a way of seeing her. He decided touse his telepathic powers to make his daughter just sick enough to require avisit from him. Using a photograph of the girl, he tried to bring about herillness. When the two children of his first marriage got sick a short timelater, he felt that he was responsible, and that his use of the evil eye hadmisfired. Strindberg dates his misfortunes from then on.A mixture of hypnosis and telepathy was used in a series of experimentsconducted by the Soviet scientist Leonid Vasiliev in the 1920s and 1930s. Theaim of the experiments was to discover not only whether telepathic communicationwas possible but also if it could be proved. In one test, Vasiliev used ahypnotist and a hypnotic subject who, the hypnotist claimed, could be made tofall asleep by telepathic suggestion. The hypnotist was placed in one room, andthe subject in another. Only Vasiliev and his assistants knew precisely when thehypnotist made the mental suggestion. In repeated tests, they established thatthe subject fell asleep within one and a half minutes of the suggestion. Later,they discovered that distance made no difference. A subject in the Crimean cityof Sebastopol fell asleep at a telepathic suggestion made in Leningrad, morethan one thousand miles away. Vasiliev wondered whether telepathic communicationmight depend upon some kind of electromagnetic radiation, and tried sealing thehypnotist up in a lead chamber. It made no difference whatever, proving that thewaves involved in telepathy have nothing in common with radio waves.After Simon Magus, the most famous magician in European history is Faust, alsoknown as Dr Faustus. The Faust legend has maintained its potency for almost fivecenturies, and has inspired at least three great works of literature—ChristopherMarlowe’s Dr Faustus (1604), Goethe’s Faust (1808 and 1832), and Thomas Mann’sDoctor Faustus (1947)—as well as many musical works. From all these, the picturethat emerges of Faust is of a brilliant, proud, restless man who longs to sharethe secrets of the gods. But these characteristics have evolved over thecenturies, and as we go backward in time we come closer to the truth about theperson who called himself Faust. Thomas Mann’s Faust is a great musician;Goethe’s Faust is a restless scholar, chafing against the frustration of beingmerely human; Marlowe’s Faustus is a scholar who has been led into temptation bythe lust for power. The book on which all these were based is Johann Spies’Historia von D. Johann Faustus, which appeared in Berlin in 1587. Its hero islittle more than a magical confidence trickster. Significantly, his chief giftis hypnosis—although, of course, the author does not use that word.In a typical episode in the Spies’ book, Faust goes to a Jew and offers to leavebehind his arm or leg as security for a loan. The Jew accepts, and Faust appearsto saw off his leg. Embarrassed and disgusted by this, the Jew later throws theleg into a river—whereupon Faust appears and demands his leg back. The Jew isforced to pay him heavy compensation. In another anecdote, Faust asks a wagonerwith a load of hay how much hay he will allow him to eat for a few pence. Thewagoner says jokingly: ‘As much as you like.’ When Faust has eaten half thewagonload, the wagoner repents his generosity and offers Faust a gold piece oncondition he leaves the rest undevoured. When he reaches home the wagonerdiscovers that his load is intact, ‘for the delusion which the doctor had raisedwas vanished’.Even the Faust of this original book is described as ‘a scholar and agentleman.’ He is said to have been the son of honest German peasants, born nearWeimar in 1491, but brought up by a well-to-do uncle in Wittenberg. This unclesent him to university. Faust’s ‘strong powers of mind’ soon distinguish him,and his friends urge him to enter the Church. But Faust has greater ambitions.He begins to dabble in sorcery. He studies Chaldean, Greek, and Arabic. He takeshis degree of Doctor of Divinity, and also a medical degree. In due course, hebecomes a famous doctor. It is intellectual brilliance that is his downfall,‘the boldness of his profane enquiries’—a quality that later generations wouldconsider a virtue, and for which even Spies has a sneaking admiration. Faustwishes to become a great magician, and this is why he invokes the Devil. Havingentered into his pact with the Devil, Faust is corrupted by the Prince ofDarkness, who proceeds to fill him with greed and lust for power.At this point, it is worth quoting the Historia on a subject that has somebearing on the lives of magicians. ‘It used to be an old saying that themagician, charm he ever so wisely for a year together, was never a sixpencericher for all his efforts.’ This belief that unusual powers cannot be used forfinancial gain is fundamental and persistent. And there seems to be some truthin it. None of the great magicians from Simon Magus to MacGregor Mathers hasdied rich, and most of them have died paupers. The few who have succeeded inliving comfortably—Emmanuel Swedenborg and Gurdjieff, for example—made theirmoney in other ways than magic.When we pass from the Faust legends to the obscure original, as described bysome of his contemporaries, we encounter exactly the sort of person that thisinvestigation has led us to expect: a coarse, vulgar, boastful man, with somenatural talent and an overmastering desire for fame. We don’t know if he wasnamed Georg Sabellicus or Johannes, but he was often called Faustus Junior. Thefirst we hear of him is in 1507 when, through the good offices of a nobleman, heobtained a post as a teacher in a boys’ school in Kreuznach near Frankfurt.Apparently he was a homosexual, for he proceeded to seduce some of his pupils,‘indulging in the most dastardly kind of lewdness’. When found out, he fled. In1509, Johannes Faust was given a degree in theology in Heidelberg, some fortymiles from Kreuznach. In 1513, the canon of St. Mary’s church in Gotha in whatis now East Germany, recorded that he had heard Georg Faust, known as ‘thedemigod of Heidelberg’, boasting and talking nonsense in an inn in nearbyErfurt.The alchemist Trithemius recalls a meeting with Faustus Junior as early as 1507,and dismisses him as a fool, a boaster, and a charlatan. In the few otherreferences we have he is casting horoscopes, making prophecies, or being drivenfrom town to town by his unsavoury reputation as a sodomite and necromancer (onewho foretells the future by communicating with the dead). From Johann Wier, anacquaintance of Faust who wrote about him, we learn that Faust was wont to boastabout ‘his friend the Devil’—which may have been nothing more than a typicalpiece of bombast. A story of Faust’s malicious humour recorded by Wier describeshow Faust, when a prisoner in the castle of Baron Hermann of Batenburg, offeredto show the nobleman’s chaplain how to remove his beard without a razor, inexchange for a bottle of wine. The chaplain was to rub his beard with the ‘magicformula’, arsenic. The gullible chaplain did this. His beard fell out, just asFaust had prophesied—but it took most of the chaplain’s skin with it. Wier alsotells us that Faust was a drunken wanderer who spent much of his time in lowtaverns, impressing the locals with conjuring tricks. Other contemporarychroniclers describe him as a liar and a ‘low juggler’.We do not know when Faust died—it was probably in the 1540s—but we do know howhis legendary fame began. A Swiss Protestant clergyman, Johanne Gast, once dinedwith Faust, and was unfavourably impressed by him—perhaps because of Faust’shints at his pact with the Devil. At all events Gast later spoke of Faust in oneof his sermons, declaring that he had been strangled by the Devil, and that hiscorpse had persisted in lying on its face, although it had been turned on itsback five times. This story had the right touch of horror to appeal to theimaginations of his congregation. Soon other stories grew up. One told how theDevil had twisted Faust’s head around completely so that it looked down hisback. Another recounted how, toward the end of his life, Faust began to hopethat he might escape the Devil’s clutches—but the trembling of the house atnight warned him that the end was near.The 16th century was an age of religious persecution, a time when a man could beexecuted on the mere suspicion that he did not believe in the Trinity. The veryidea of a man selling his soul to the Devil was enough to make Faust’scontemporaries turn pale. Little wonder, then, that Spies’ Historia became oneof the most popular works of its time. Phillip Melancthon, a follower of Luther,also preached about Faust. He gilded the lily somewhat with a story that Fausthad defeated and eaten a rival magician in Vienna. Luther also has two slightingreferences to Faust in his Table Talk, from which it is clear that he regardedFaust as a common charlatan rather a demonic wonder worker. The only powers thatsome of Faust’s educated contemporaries were willing to grant him were the giftsof casting accurate horoscopes and of foretelling the future. In 1535, forinstance, Faust correctly predicted that the Bishop of Munster would recapturethe city, and in 1540 he foretold the defeat of the European armies inVenezuela.Legend has made Faust the most famous figure in the history of necromancy. Butwhen we peer through the legendary mist, what do we find? Most of the moresensational stories about the man as told by people who knew him, tell of featsthat have been more or less duplicated by other men of strange powers down theages. It is difficult to decide whether this helps to support or to discreditFaust? credentials as a magician. When we try to sift fact from legend, itbecomes clear that Faust knew something about hypnosis. It may be that he alsoknew how to conjure poltergeists. The priest Gast claimed that when Faust wasangered by the poor hospitality offered to him by some monks, he sent apoltergeist to trouble them. Apparently the rattling spirit created such afurore that the monks had to abandon their monastery. Accounts made it plainthat Faust was stupid, boastful, and malicious. The same is true of many men ofstrange powers. As we shall see, Faust’s restless egoism, his desire to impress,his need to bend nature to his will are characteristic of many of the best-knownmagicians from Simon Magus onward. Magicians are not comfortable people to know.Faust was not the most celebrated magician of his age. He had two remarkablecontemporaries, Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, whose fame greatly anddeservedly surpassed his own, and who were undoubtedly white magicians. Agrippaand Paracelsus were both students of that strange mystical system of knowledgecalled the Cabala, whose purpose is to show the fallen man his way back toParadise and the godhead. The two works that contain the essence of cabalisticteaching—the Sefer Yetsirah, Book of Creation, and the Zohar, Book ofSplendor—are of such profound importance in the history of magic that we mustsay a few words about them here.The Book of Creation dates from the 2nd century AD. The Book of Splendorappeared in an Aramaic manuscript written by a student named Moses de Léon inthe late 13th century. It is, however, a tradition that the teachings of bothbooks date from the beginning of human history, when angels taught Adam thesecret of how to recover his lost bliss. Cabalists think of man as a being whois tied up and enveloped in a complicated straitjacket—like Houdini before oneof his celebrated escapes—and whose problem is to discover how to untie all theknots. Most men do not even realise that they are tied up. The cabalist not onlyknows it: he knows also that man’s highest state is total freedom.According to the Cabala, when Adam sinned he fell from a state of union withGod. He fell down through 10 lower states of consciousness into a state ofamnesia, in which he totally forgot his divine origin, his true identity. Man’stask, therefore, is to clamber back until he once more attains his higheststate. The journey is long and hard. It is not simply a matter of climbing, likeJack clambering up the beanstalk, because the ‘beanstalk’ passes through 10different ‘realms’. But even that image is too simple: the beanstalk does notpass straight upward, like a fireman’s pole, but wanders from side to side.The image of the beanstalk is apt because the Cabala is essentially the study ofa sacred tree—the Tree of Life. At the top of the tree is God the Creator, whois called Kether (the crown). The nine other branches of the tree are wisdom,beauty, power, understanding, love, endurance, majesty, foundation, and kingdom.These are known collectively as the Sefiroth—emanations, or potencies, and it isthey that constitute the realms through which the beanstalk passes. There is afurther complication. The traditional picture of the Tree of Life looks ratherlike a diagram of a chemical molecule, in which the atoms are connected to eachother by lines. These lines correspond to the 22 paths of the Cabala thatconnect the realms.The Tree of Life no longer grows on earth. How, then, does the aspirant setabout climbing it? There are three main ways. First, one may explore the realmson the astral plane. Another way to explore the realms of the Cabala is throughinner vision—that is, by achieving a semi-trancelike or visionary state in whichthe realms appear before the inner eye. A third way is the obvious one: study ofthe Cabala itself. It is, however, perhaps the most difficult way of all,because its revelations of man’s consciousness and destiny are not spoken ofdirectly, but lie hidden in an enormously complex system of symbols.The realms of the Sefiroth, however, are not themselves symbols. According tothe Cabala, they are real worlds. For instance, if the wandering astral bodyfinds itself in a realm containing doves and spotted leopards, a land burstingwith an almost overwhelming glory of life, it is almost certainly in the realmof Netshah, or Venus—symbol of endurance and victory.The doctrines of the Cabala were probably far above the head of a charlatan suchas Faust. But Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus were not charlatans. Theyregarded themselves as scientists and philosophers, and they were far moreintelligent than Faust. Yet both of them were flawed by the defects we have cometo realize are characteristic of so many magicians: a craving to be admired, anda crude will to power. When these ambitions are frustrated, even men of genuinepowers will often misuse their powers like a charlatan.Like Faust, Cornelius Agrippa became the subject of many remarkable legends.What was the truth behind such incredible tales? Cornelius Agrippa—whose realname was Heinrich Cornelis—was born in Cologne in 1486. His parents weresufficiently well-off to send him to the recently founded university of Cologne,where he proved to be a brilliant scholar. It was an exciting time for youngintellectuals. Gutenberg had invented the printing press some 50 years beforeAgrippa was born, and the printed book had created the same kind of revolutionas radio and television were to do five centuries later. Agrippa read everythinghe could lay his hands on. One day he discovered the Cabala, and it at onceappealed to something deep within him. A magician was made.At the age of 20 Agrippa became a court secretary to the Holy Roman Emperor, anda distinguished career seemed assured for him. But Agrippa was a divided man.Part of him, as we have said, craved celebrity and power; but he loathed theworld of diplomacy and courtly intrigue by which such success could be achieved.By now he was also obsessed by the ultimate other world of the Cabala.At about this time, he attended the University of Paris where he studiedmysticism and philosophy. There he met a Spaniard named Gerona, who had recentlybeen forced to flee from his estate in Catalonia after a peasants’ revolt.Agrippa offered to help him, sensing that if their mission succeeded, Gerona’sgratitude might enable Agrippa to settle in Spain and devote his life to studyof the Cabala. They went to Catalonia, and Agrippa devised a brilliant plan thatenabled them to capture a stronghold from the rebels. But they were laterbesieged, Agrippa was forced to flee, and Gerona was captured and probablymurdered. The episode was typical of the bad luck that was to pursue Agrippa forthe rest of his life.He returned to his job as court secretary, but he felt so frustrated that heleft after a few months and began wandering around Europe. Within a year or twohe had acquired a reputation as a black magician, and it was to cause him agreat deal of trouble. In 1509 he taught in Dôle, France under the patronage ofQueen Margaret of Austria. The local monks became jealous of this patronage,however, and plotted against him. When one of them preached against him in thepresence of the queen, Agrippa decided it was time to move on. In 1515 he wasknighted on a battlefield in Italy, and became Cornelius Agrippa vonNettesheim—a name taken from that of a small village near Cologne.He was granted a pension by King Francis I of France, but this was revoked whenAgrippa refused to cast horoscopes for the king’s mother. Agrippa was later madeofficial historian by Queen Margaret, but was unwise enough to publish a work inwhich he attempted to demonstrate that all knowledge is useless. This so enragedhis academic colleagues that he lost his job. Soon he was imprisoned for debt.Agrippa certainly lacked tact, for after this he again made the mistake ofspeaking his mind about Queen Margaret, for which he was thrown into prison andtortured. His health broken, he died in 1535 at the age of 49. Legend says that,as he lay on his deathbed, he cursed his wasted life and the black arts that hadseduced him. Whereupon his black dog rushed out of the house and threw itselfinto a river—clearly proving thereby that it was a demon in disguise.These biographical snippets, however richly spiced with legends, hardly add upto a man of strange powers. The certainty that Agrippa was indeed a magician,however, lies in the three volumes of his treatise The Occult Philosophy, whichis regarded as one of the great magical texts. The book makes it clear thatAgrippa knew all about thought pressure. Magic, he insists, is a faculty thatsprings from the power of the mind and imagination. There are mysteriousrelations between the human body and the universe, and between the earth onwhich we live and higher spiritual worlds. Thus, he argued, a stone can teach usabout the nature of the stars. Agrippa believed that all nature is boundtogether by a kind of vast spider’s web. Most human beings never learn to usetheir innate magical powers because they believe that they are cut off from therest of nature. The magician, on the contrary, knows that his thought, ifproperly directed, can set the web vibrating and cause effects in far distantplaces.Agrippa wrote his extraordinary masterwork when he was only 23 years old. Itshows that, even at this early age, his study of the Cabala had given him someprofound insights. Because he was always in danger of being burned as a blackmagician, he was careful to insist in his book that his knowledge is of a kindthat any serious student can acquire from study of the great philosophers andmystics. But he also admits that he has successfully practised divination andforetelling the future. For example, he describes two methods by which he claimsto have detected the identity of thieves. One method is to pivot a sieve onforceps held between the index fingers of two students. The sieve will begin toswing like a pendulum when the name of the guilty person is mentioned.Similarly, if the sieve is pivoted so that it can be made to spin, it will stopspinning when the thief’s name is spoken.Agrippa insists that the success of these and other magical techniques are dueto spirits—similar, presumably, to the spirits that help fakirs to perform theirwonders. The overwhelming impression that emerges from the book is that Agrippawas a sensitive—born with the gifts of precognition, telepathy, and the abilityto influence events by using the power of his mind. His belief that mind is morepowerful than matter runs like a thread through the book. The Occult Philosophyis the work of a young man—full of vitality and brilliance—and of a dreamer whopeered into a world that few of us have the gift to see.The case of Paracelsus is even more tantalising than that of Agrippa. Hiswritings prove him to have been a more remarkable man—a great scientist as wellas a magician. But, again, seeking the truth about him is like groping about ina fog, so obscured is his life with myth and legend.He was born as Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim in 1493, the son of animpoverished Swiss nobleman who had become a doctor. He studied medicine inBasel and completed his education at universities in Italy and Germany. Hisgifts as a physician were immediately apparent, and a series of remarkable curessoon earned him a formidable reputation. In 1524, when he was only 29 years old,he was appointed professor of medicine at Basel University. In nine years he hadbecome one of the great names in medicine in Europe.It was at this point that his career, so rich in both achievement and promise,was undermined by the same kind of character defects that brought ruin toAgrippa, and that seem to be hallmarks of so many magicians. He wasvainglorious. He chose the pseudonym ‘Paracelsus’ because it implied that he wasgreater than Celsus, the famous physician of ancient Rome. He was a heavydrinker, and was prey to sudden violent tempers. One of his first acts asprofessor at Basel University was to order his students to hold a public burningof the books of Avicenna, Galen, and other famous doctors of the past. Thisenraged his colleagues, who condemned him as an exhibitionist and a charlatan.When they plotted against him, Paracelsus compounded his unpopularity by callingthem names—like many paranoid people he had a powerful gift for invective. For awhile his reputation held his enemies at bay and when he cured the publisherFrobenius of an infected leg that other doctors had decided to amputate, itseemed that he had become invulnerable to attack. Soon after this, however, apatient declined to pay his bill and Paracelsus took him to court. Owing to theplots of his enemies, he lost the case, whereupon he rained such violent abuseon the heads of the judges that a warrant was issued for his arrest. He wasforced to flee Basel—and his long soul-destroying downfall had begun.For the remainder of his life Paracelsus wandered all over Europe as anitinerant doctor, writing book after book of which few were published in hislifetime, and pouring scorn and invective on his enemies. Fourteen years ofwandering and disappointment wore him out. In 1541, when he was 48 years old, hewas invited by the Prince Palatine to settle at his seat in Salzburg. At last hemight have found contentment in a quiet life of study. But he continued to drinktoo much, and six months later he rolled down a hill in a drunken stupor, anddied of his injuries.Then, ironically, his books began to be published, and they spread his fame overEurope once more. They have a range and boldness of imagination that isreminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci’s notebooks. Paracelsus immediately became akind of patron saint of occultism—a position he maintains even today, with hiswritings being studied by a new generation of occultists.As with Agrippa, it is difficult to discover four centuries later what genuinepowers lay behind the many legends of Paracelsus’s magical prowess. One thing isclear: most of the stories concern remarkable cures, and this suggests that hewas primarily gifted with seemingly magical powers of healing. For example, weare told that he cured an innkeeper’s daughter who since birth had beenparalysed from the waist down. The medicine he gave her was probably saltpetrein teaspoonfuls of wine. This would obviously have had no effect, but it seemsthat the hypnotic force of his personality and his natural healing power broughtabout a cure. We are also again confronted by the paradox of the splitpersonality: a man who was bad-tempered, thin-skinned, and boastful, yet whocould be taken over by some strange power that rose from his subconscious depthsand made him a great healer.So we reach the odd conclusion that the contemporaries of Agrippa and Paracelsuswere probably right when they called them charlatans—but that, at the same time,both men possessed genuine powers. It would be another four centuries before thegreat Swiss psychologist Carl Jung attempted to explain these powersscientifically in terms of that vast reservoir of energy known as thesubconscious mind.In the 16th century it was still dangerous for a man of knowledge to gain areputation as a wizard or sorcerer. The witch hunting craze was spreading acrossEurope, and many people were being burned for being in league with the Devil.This no doubt explains why we know so little of the lives of the alchemists whofollowed in the footsteps of Agrippa and Paracelsus. That remarkable 16thcentury French physician and prophet Nostradamus took care to hide his visionsin verse of such obscurity that even nowadays we cannot be certain what most ofthem mean.Dr John Dee, the most highly regarded magician of Shakespeare’s time, is almostunique among magicians in that he possessed practically no occult powers.Perhaps this is why he managed to avoid the usual magician’s destiny ofspectacular success and tragic downfall.He was born in 1527, the son of a minor official in the court of King HenryVIII. From childhood on he was an avid reader, and when he went to CambridgeUniversity at the age of 15, he allowed himself only four hours’ sleep a night.After Cambridge he went to the University of Louvain in Belgium, where Agrippahad also studied. When Dee read Agrippa’s Occult Philosophy, he knew that he hadstumbled on his life’s work—the pursuit of magical knowledge. At the age of 23he gave a series of free lectures on geometry in Rheims, France, and was sopopular that he was offered a professorship. But he preferred to return toEngland to pursue his occult studies.When Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558, she asked Dee to cast a suitabledate for her coronation. Dee did so, and from this time on he enjoyed royalprotection. Even so, as one suspected of magical practices, he still had tobehave with extreme caution. Moreover, Queen Elizabeth was notoriously stingy:her patronage did nothing to improve Dee’s finances, and he remained poor allhis life. Dee married a lady-in-waiting who bore him eight children. He livedquietly and studied astrology, crystal-gazing, and alchemy.The aim of crystal-gazing is to induce a semi-trancelike state in which thesubconscious mind projects future events as images in the crystal. Dee was toomuch of an intellectual to be good at this. He realized that what he needed wasa working partner with natural occult faculties, especially in scrying. In 1582he met Edward Kelley, a young Irishman who claimed to have second sight. Kelleywas undoubtedly a crook—he had had both his ears cut off for forgery—but itseems equally certain that he did possess second sight, and that he was also amedium. Dee’s wife took an immediate dislike to the Irishman, but when Kelleywent into a trance and began to get in touch with spirits, Dee was so delightedthat he overruled his wife’s objections.How did Dee and Kelley go about summoning the spirits? One famous print showsthem in a graveyard practicing necromancy. From what we know of the pious Dee,however, it seems unlikely that he went in for this sort of thing. We can learnmore from his Spiritual Diaries. It is clear that he went into training beforeendeavouring to summon the spirits. He abstained for three days from sexualintercourse, overeating, and the consumption of alcohol, and he took care toshave his beard and cut his nails. Then began a two-week period of magicalinvocations in Latin and Hebrew beginning at dawn and continuing until noon,then beginning again at sunset and continuing until midnight. Kelley, meanwhile,gazed intently into the crystal ball. At the end of fourteen days, Kelley wouldbegin to see angels and demons in the crystal. Later, these spirits would walkabout the room. Dee, however, does not seem to have seen the spirits, but herecorded lengthy dialogues he had with them.One’s instant response to this is the conviction that Kelley made Dee believethat nonexistent spirits had manifested themselves. The trouble with this viewis that the conversations, which came via the mouth of Kelley, were often socrammed with abstruse magical lore that it is almost inconceivable that theilliterate Irishman could have made them up as he went along. Dee, of course,was familiar with the lore, and certain of the demons quoted chunks of Agrippa’sOccult Philosophy. This makes it possible that Dee transmitted themtelepathically to Kelley. The likeliest explanation, however, is that Kelley wasa natural medium.Count Adalbert Laski, a servant of Henry III of France, was so impressed bythese seances of Dee and Kelley that he invited them to visit the king ofGermany. Dee and his family, and Kelley and his wife spent four years travellingaround Europe as guests of various kings and noblemen, and their performanceswere sensationally successful.Kelley was a difficult man, given to sudden tantrums and to fits of boredom anddepression; but in spite of their ups and downs, he and Dee continued to worktogether for many years. They finally separated while they were still on theirtravels in Europe. Kelley achieved some success on his own as an alchemist andscryer, but eventually he died in prison. Dee returned to England in 1589 andlived for another nineteen years, hoping in vain that the spirits would lead himto a crock of gold. Today his reputation among occultists is secure, for he wasthe first magician on record to make use of spirit communication. He was twohundred years before his time; but in spite of his lack of worldly success, heremains one of the great names in the history of magic.The tide turned in the 17th and 18th centuries—the age of scientists such asNewton, Huygens, and Harvey—and the seeker after forbidden knowledge once againbecame respectable, at least in Protestant countries. Sir Isaac Newton—one ofthe greatest names in science and philosophy—spent as much time in hisalchemical laboratory as at his telescope.The career of Anton Mesmer—which was described in Chapter 2[../Text/07_chapter02.html]—illustrates the difficulty of distinguishing betweenthe scientist, and the magician. Mesmer regarded himself as a scientist, but hisbelief in the ‘vital forces’ of the universe classifies him among the mysticsand magicians. Mesmer has an important place in the history of magic for anotherreason: that unlike some of his great predecessors, it is difficult to draw aline between where the scientist ended and the charlatan began. And this, as weshall see, is a problem that continues to plague the history of magic into thesecond half of the 20th century.Nowhere is this more apparent than in the case of the man whose name has becomesynonymous with seduction: Jacques Casanova, the adventurer and confidencetrickster who flourished in the second half of the 18th century. Not only wasCasanova an accomplished faith-healer (he cured an ailing Venetian senator bymeans of suggestion), but he was also remarkably successful at fortune-tellingby means of cards and other oracles. Indeed, the accuracy of his predictionssometimes alarmed Casanova himself. For instance, he told one girl that shewould go to Paris and become the King’s mistress—and that is exactly whathappened. Casanova believed that he somehow conjured up real spirits when he wasmuttering his bogus incantations. What seems more likely is that he possessedthe same occult faculty as Paracelsus or Faust to some degree.Casanova met, and immediately disliked, another charlatan who acquired areputation as a great magician: the man who called himself the ‘Count ofSaint-Germain’. When Saint-Germain arrived in Vienna in the mid-1740s he seemedto be about 30 years old—a man of powerful and dominant personality, with thetypical magician’s streak of boastfulness and desire to astonish. In Vienna hewas befriended by members of the nobility, and was brought to Paris by theMarshal de Belle-Isle. By 1758 he had become a close friend of Louis XV and hismistress Madame de Pompadour.Part of Saint-Germain’s attraction was his reputation as a man of mystery. Noone seemed to have any idea of where or when he was born. But his knowledge ofhistory seemed to be enormous, and occasionally he said things that suggested heknew far more about certain events in the remote past than any mere studentpossibly could know. In short, he implied that he had actually witnessed them inperson. He would learnedly discourse on the priesthood of Egypt in a way thatsuggested he had studied in ancient Thebes or Heliopolis. Another puzzle wasthat he was never seen to eat, although it is now known that he had a specialdiet. He explained that he lived on some elixir of which only he knew theformula. He was a student of alchemy, and claimed to have discovered the secretof the Philosopher’s Stone. What is certain is that he had learned a great dealabout metallurgy and chemistry.Saint-Germain continues to fascinate students of occultism. Many of them believehe is alive today—possibly in Tibet. The unromantic truth is that he died in hismid-70s in 1784, suffering from rheumatism and morbid depression. Accounts ofpeople who met him indicate that, far from being a man of mystery and an enigma,he struck many intelligent people as a fool, charlatan, boaster, and swindler.If Saint-Germain seems to have been fundamentally a confidence man, the samecannot be said of his famous contemporary Count Alessandro di Cagliostro. Thathe was a fraud there can be little doubt, but that he also possessed highlydeveloped occult faculties is fairly certain. His enemies said that Cagliostro’sreal name was Giuseppe Balsamo, and that he had been a confidence trickster inhis native Italy. As a schoolboy he was exuberant and ungovernable, and ran awayfrom seminary school several times. In his teens he became a wanderer, like manytalented and penniless young men, and lived by his wits. But he was also an avidstudent of alchemy, astrology, and ritual magic, and he soon had a wide, if notvery coherent, knowledge of occultism.At the age of 26 in 1769 Cagliostro fell in love with Lorenza, the beautiful14-year-old daughter of a coppersmith. They married, and for many years she washis partner in adventure and fraud, her beauty being one of their greatestassets. When Casanova met them in the south of France the year after theirmarriage, as they were returning from a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostella inSpain, they appeared to be people of means, travelling in style and distributingalms to the poor. In Paris, the couple came under the protection of a nobleman,who then seduced Lorenza and tried to make her leave her husband. Cagliostro hadher thrown into jail, but later reunited with her and took her to England.In London he joined the Freemasons. Soon, however, he founded his own masonicorder, infusing its ceremonies with occult rituals purportedly based on ancientEgyptian practices that Cagliostro claimed he had discovered in an Egyptianmanuscript on a bookstall. Cagliostro was undoubtedly convinced that hisEgyptian masonry was the product of divine inspiration. It was certainly theturning-point in his fortunes. From London he journeyed to Venice, Berlin,Nuremberg, and Leipzig. In each city, he visited the masonic lodge, madespeeches on his Egyptian rite, and initiated members. His argument seems to havebeen that the Egyptian rite was as different from, and as superior to,established freemasonry as New Testament Christianity is from Old TestamentJudaism. He was feted and admired, and became a rich man.Cagliostro came to Strasbourg in 1780, and soon became the most talked about manin town. Although he was wealthy, he lived modestly in a room above a tobaccoshop. His cures became legendary. He was often able to heal the sick simply bythe laying on of hands. On one occasion he successfully delivered a baby aftermidwives had given up the mother for dead.It was in Strasbourg that he met the man who was to bring about his downfall:Cardinal de Rohan. He was a churchman who longed for royal favour, but vhounfortunately was disliked by Queen Marie Antoinette. Caglostro deeply impressedRohan, who spoke of his luminous and hypnotic eyes with almost religious fervor.The cardinal’s downfall occured in 1785 in the famous Affair of the DiamondNecklace. A prety swindler who called herself the Countess de la Motte Valoisbecame Rohan’s mistress, and persuaded him that the queen vanted him to secretlybuy a diamond necklace worth $300,00. In fact, the queen knew nothing of it, andthe money raised by the cardinal went straight into the countess’s pocket. Whentie jewellers finally approached the queen for a long overdue instament on themoney, the whole affair came to light. The countess was tried and publiclyflogged. Rohan and Cagliostro were also tried and, although they were acquitted,the scandal damaged both of them irreparably. In addition, the months thatCagliostro spent in jail before trial broke his nerve—and his luck.Cagliostro went to London after leaving prison. There he accurately predictedthe nature and date of the French Revolution and of the fall of the Bastille.Then he travelled around Europe, often hounded by the police. Finally, he madethe extraordinary error of going to Rome to propagate his Egyptian freemasonryunder the nose of the Pope. He wis arrested and thrown into the papal prison inthe Castel Sant’ Aigelo, and was later transferred to the even worse prison ofSan Leo. Eight years after his arrest in 1787, French soldiers capturec San Leoprison and searched for Cagliostro, intending to treat him as a revolutionaryhero. In fact, he had been dead for sevenl years—though exactly when and how hedied is still unknown.Of all the great charlatan-magicians, Cagliostro is the most tragic. One of hisenemies said that he possessed ‘a demonic power that paralyzes the will’. Bit inretrospect he seems less a demon than a fallen angel.In 1801 there appeared in London a work called The Magus, or CelestialIntelligencer by Francis Barrett. It was supposed to be ‘a complete system ofoccult philosophy’. Nowadays it is not highly regarded by students and adepts ofthe magic arts, because many of the rituals it details are garbled andinaccurate. Nevertheless, it was an important work for it was almost the firstattempt at a serious description of magical practices since Agrippa’s OccultPhilosophy nearly three centuries earlier. After Agrippa’s time, fear ofpersecution had driven the magicians underground for two hundred years.The Age of Reason, as thinkers and writers of mid-18th century Europe calledtheir period, had made magic superfluous—or at least unfashionable. But the tidesoon turned again. For the popular imagination, at least, reason was not enough.All over western Europe novels such as Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otrantobegan to appear, in which high adventure and crimes of passion were mixed withsupernatural events. Of course, most readers did not really believe in thesupernatural trappings of such stories—but their enormous popularity shows thatghosts, magic, and the paranormal continued to fascinate. At the end of TheMagus, Barrett printed an advertisement asking for students to help him found a‘magic circle’, and an active group was established at Cambridge.Nine years after publication of The Magus, there was born in Paris a remarkableman who, more than any other, was responsible for the great magical revival thatswept across Europe in the 19th century: Alphonse-Louis Constant, better knownas Eliphas Lévi. The son of a poor shoemaker, Lévi was a dreamy, sickly, highlyintelligent and imaginative child with powerful religious inclinations. At theage of 12 in 1822, he decided he was destined for the Church. He had a cravingto belong to some spiritual order, some great organization, that would enablehim to devote his life to the truths of the spirit. His teacher at the seminaryof Saint Nicholas du Chardonnet was Abbot Frere-Colonna, a remarkable idealistwho believed that man was slowly ascending toward God, and that a great age ofthe Holy Spirit was at hand. The abbot had studied Mesmer’s doctrines, andbelieved that they were inspired by the Devil. He devoted some time todenouncing them in class, but succeeded only in awakening young Lévi’s interestin such forbidden matters. When the abbot was dismissed through the intrigues ofjealous colleagues, Lévi’s disillusion with the Church began.Lévi still hungered for a faith, however. He became a sub-deacon, and one of hischief tasks was teaching catechism to the young girls. One day a poor womanbegged him to prepare her daughter for first communion, and Lévi’s initialfeelings of protectiveness developed into a wild infatuation for the girl.Nothing came of it, but the experience convinced him that he was not intendedfor the priesthood. When he turned away from his vocation, his mother committedsuicide.After fourteen years in a seminary, Lévi found the world a hard place to adjustto. He still wanted to be a believer, and dreamed of Frere-Colonna’s spiritualrebirth of mankind. So, although he began to write for radical newspapers—andspent time in prison on sedition charges as a result—his search for a faithcontinued. He discovered the writings of Swedenborg, and then the Cabala withits doctrine that man can overcome original sin and rise toward the godhead.Honoré de Balzac’s mystical novel Louis Lambert was also a vital influence. Lévistudied that strange fortune-telling deck of cards known as the Tarot, andlinked its 22 cards of the Major Arcana with the 22 paths of the Cabala. Lévicame to certain important conclusions about magic. The first was that the willis a far greater power than we realize, and that magic is learning how to usethis power. The second was that all space is permeated with a medium that Lévicalled astral light, which can take the impression of thoughts and feelings, andis the medium through which thoughts are conveyed in telepathy. Third, hebelieved deeply in the microcosm-macrocosm doctrine enshrined in HermesTrismegistus’s inscription, ‘As above, so below.’Lévi was in his 40s when his Dogma and Ritual of High Magic was published in1856, and it established a reputation that was consolidated four years later byhis History of Magic. In the first book he describes one of the most curiousincidents of his life. On a visit to London, he records, he was asked to try toraise the spirit of the ancient Greek magician Apollonius of Tyana. After amonth of preparation and fasting, Lévi spent twelve hours in ritualincantations. At last, the shade of Apollonius appeared in a gray shroud, andtelepathically answered questions Lévi put to it about the future of two of hisacquaintances. It prophesied the death of both. Lévi’s description of theinvocation has considerable dramatic quality:‘I kindled two fires with the requisite prepared substances, and began readingthe invocations of the “Ritual” in a voice at first low, but rising by degrees.The smoke spread, the flame caused the objects on which it fell to waver, thenit went out, the smoke still floating white and slow about the marble altar. Iseemed to feel a quaking of the earth, my ears tingled, my heart beat quickly. Iheaped more twigs and perfumes on the chafing dishes, and as the flames againburst up, I beheld distinctly, before the altar, the figure of a man of morethan normal size, which dissolved and vanished away. I re-commenced theevocations, and placed myself within a circle which I had drawn previouslybetween the tripod and the altar. Thereupon the mirror which was behind thealtar seemed to brighten in its depth, and a wan form was outlined therein,which increased and seemed to approach by degrees. Three times, and with closedeyes, I invoked Apollonius. When I again looked forth there was a man in frontof me, wrapped from head to foot in a species of shroud, which seemed more graythan white. He was lean, melancholy, and beardless, and did not altogethercorrespond to my preconceived notion of Apollonius. I experienced an abnormallycold sensation, and when I endeavoured to question the phantom I could notarticulate a syllable. I therefore placed my hand upon the sign of thepentagram, and pointed the sword at the figure, commanding it mentally to obeyand not alarm me, in virtue of the said sign. The form thereupon became vague,and suddenly disappeared. I directed it to return, and presently felt, as itwere, a breath close by me; something touched my hand which was holding thesword, and the arm became immediately benumbed as far as the elbow. I divinedthat the sword displeased the spirit, and I therefore placed it point downward,close by me, within the circle. The human figure reappeared immediately, but Iexperienced such an intense weakness in all my limbs, and a swooning sensationcame so quickly over me, that I made two steps to sit down, whereupon I fellinto profound lethargy, accompanied by dreams, of which I had only a confusedrecollection when I came to myself. For several subsequent days, the armremained benumbed and painful.’In spite of these setbacks, Lévi persisted and, according to his own account,was able to consult the spirit on two more occasions on some fine points ofcabalism.Lévi was a widely respected magician for the remainder of his life, andattracted many disciples. That he had occult powers—or that his disciples wereconvinced he had—is certain. A disciple to whom Lévi had given a prayer torecite before he fell asleep found that the words of the prayer were glowing inthe dark, and that Lévi’s spirit was standing by his bed. It seems likely thatLévi possessed the power of projecting his astral body.His books strike the modern reader as wildly imaginative and confused, but theyexerted an immense influence on a whole generation of students of the occult.His death in 1875 was mourned by hundreds of occultists in France, Germany, andEngland, who regarded him as the great master.In 1831, when Lévi was still studying for the priesthood, there was born inRussia a woman who was to exert an even greater influence than he on19th-century occultism: Elena Hahn, later Petrovna, but known as MadameBlavatsky. Born into an aristocratic family, she married at 16, left her husbandsoon after, and began to travel around the world. She was an explosive,charming, delightful personality. For a while she worked as a bareback rider ina circus, and dabbled in many odd interests. She had undoubted mediumisticpowers, and throughout her life odd manifestations were apt to occur in herpresence: inexplicable rappings, ringing of bells, and movements of objects. Infact, it seems that she had the power of raising poltergeists. After livingcarelessly until she was just past 40, and then wondering how to make a living,she decided to turn her occult abilities to account and become a medium.On going to the United States she met Colonel Olcott, a lawyer and journalistwho became her lifelong admirer and tireless publicist. She told Olcott that shewas in touch with a certain spiritual Brotherhood of Luxor, presumably priestsof ancient Egypt, and he believed her—as he believed everything else she toldhim. Together they formed the Theosophical Society, a movement for the study ofancient wisdom. For three years it flourished in America. In 1879, as interestseemed to wane, they decided to move to India, which Madame Blavatsky regardedas the fountainhead of spiritual wisdom.In Bombay, Theosophy was an immediate success. The charismatic personality ofMadame Blavatsky fascinated the Hindus even more than it had fascinated theAmericans. She claimed that the Secret Masters in Tibet, a group of spiritualinitiates, had imparted their wisdom to her. When disciples asked her questionsabout these matters, paper notes fell from the air. The notes contained detailedreplies to the questions and were signed ‘Koot Hoomi’. These notes later becamefamous as the Mahatma Letters. Koot Hoomi, a semi-divine Master, was even seenby some devotees one moonlight night.In 1884 the bombshell cane. A housekeeper with whom Madame Blavatsky hadquarrelled told a Western journalist that most of the magical effects weremerely tricks. The Mahatma Letters were simply dropped through a crack in theceiling of the room in which the disciples had gathered, and the seven-foot-tallKoot Hoomi was actually a model carried around on someone’s shoulders.Examination of a cabinet in which many manifestations had occurred revealed asecret panel. The Society for Psychical Research, which had been investigatingher powers, issued a sceptical report.It might seem that the Blavatsky reputation was irretrievable. Not a bit of it.Madame Blavatsky set sail for London—and soon the Theosophical Society wasflourishing again, although it never achieved anything like its earlier success.Once again, accounts of Madame Blavatsky’s magical powers began to circulateamong occultists. The poet W. B. Yeats, a serious and long-term student of theoccult—reported that when he visited Madame Blavatsky, her cuckoo clock madehooting noises at him. A. P. Sinnett, who later became her faithful disciple,complained when he visited her that he had attempted to raise spirits atseances, but could not even get rapping sounds. ‘Oh, raps are the easiest thingto get,’ she replied—and raps immediately sounded from all parts of the room.When Madame Blavatsky died in 1891, six years after the fiasco that drove herout of India, she left behind a host of disciples who firmly believed in theexistence of Koot Hoomi and the Tibetan Masters. She also left behind two hugebooks, Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine, in which she explains that theearth is destined to evolve through seven ‘root races’, of which we are tiefifth. Much of these enormous, bewildering books is taken up with descriptionsof the root races.In retrospect, it seems fairly certain that Madame Blavatsky was a genuinemedium of unusual powers. It is more certain that, when her somewhat erraticpowers were feeble, she helped them out with trickery—a temptation to whichdozens of bona fide mediums and magicians have succumbed. She was in short botha charlatan and a genuine magician, and her hypnotically powerful personalitymade her one of the most remarkable women of the 19th century.The next major step in the history of magic was the founding of the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn. One day in 1885 a middle-aged clergyman named Woodfordwas passing an idle hour at a secondhand bookstall on Farringdon Street inLondon. Among the dusty volumes he came upon a bound, handwritten manuscriptthat was obviously in cipher. Woodford was a student of the occult, and herecognised certain symbols of the Cabala in the text. He bought the manuscriptbut, after several unsuccessful attempts to decode it, put it aside. Two yearslater, in the summer of 1887, he sent the manuscript to a friend, Dr WilliamWynn Westcott, a coroner who was interested in occultism and freemasonry.Westcott was familiar with the first major work on ciphers, the Steganographiaby the 15th-century alchemist Abbot Johann Trithemius, and it did not take himlong to conclude that the mysterious pages were actually written in Trithemius’scode. When deciphered they proved to be five magical rituals for introducingnewcomers into a secret society, together with notes on various cabalisticmatters.Concealed among the pages Westcott found a letter in German, which stated thatanyone interested in these rituals should contact a certain Fräulein Sprengel atan address in Stuttgart. Westcott lost no time in writing to her. FräuleinSprengel replied, divulging that she was a member of a German magical order. Acorrespondence about magic ensued, and eventually Fräulein Sprengel gaveWestcott permission to found an English branch of the order, and to use therituals to initiate members. Accordingly, in 1888, Westcott founded a societycalled The Isis-Urania Temple of the Golden Dawn. (Its pretentious title perhapsreflects the influence of Madame Blavatsky, who had arrived in London from Indiaa few months previously.) Two other students of the occult were co-founders:William Woodman, a retired doctor who had studied the Cabala in Hebrew, andSamuel Liddell Mathers, an eccentric scholar of aristocratic leanings. Beforelong the Golden Dawn had branches in Edinburgh, Weston-super-Mare, and Bradford,and an enthusiastic following of displaced intellectuals and cranks. Its membersincluded the beautiful actress Florence Farr, the poet W. B. Yeats, and theyoung and as yet unknown Aleister Crowley.This, at any rate, is the story of the founding of the Golden Dawn as put aboutby Westcott and Mathers. In recent years Ellic Howe, the historian of magic, haslooked into the matter closely, and has concluded that Fräulein Sprengel neverexisted. The cipher manuscript was probably genuine, but it came from acollection of occultist Fred Hockley, who died in 1885, and not from a bookstallin Farringdon Street. Westcott, probably with the connivance of Mathers, forgedvarious letters in German purporting to come from Fräulein Sprengel. His aimevidently was to give the society a certain authority rooted in ancientpractices. Mathers was later to denounce the Sprengel letters as forgeries,although he must have known about them from the beginning. Westcott seems tohave been a Jekyll and Hyde character. Indeed, his split personality was somarked that he wrote in two completely different styles of handwriting. As forMathers, who was to change his name to MacGregor Mathers and pose as a Scottisharistocrat, he was one of those curious figures who seem to occur so often inthe history of magic—a kind of confidence trickster whose aim was not so much toswindle as to gain respect, admiration, and power.Does all this mean, then, that the Order of the Golden Dawn was nothing morethan a combination of chicanery and wishful thinking? By no means. Its membersdid, beyond question, pursue serious and genuine studies of the magical arts. Atthis point, then, we must have a closer look at the whole subject of magic andthose who practice it.First of all, we have to admit that common-sense insists that magic is bound tobe nonsense. How could some semi-religious ceremony have the slightest influenceon the real world? Clergymen in church may pray for rain, or prosperity, orvictory in battle, but they do not expect their prayers to produce a definiteeffect; they merely hope that God will pay attention. So why should some magicceremony, not even addressed to God, have the power to influence actual events?This is, I repeat, the commonsense view, the so-called scientific approach. Butevery day, thousands of events occur that science refuses to recognise becausethey appear to flout scientific laws. Dowsing, telepathy, precognition of futureevents, and spectres of the living are only a few examples. Perhaps we cannotreally blame scientists for declining to pay too much attention to these things.The aim of science is to describe the universe in terms of natural laws,especially laws that forge unbreakable links between cause and effect—between anoccurrence and the forces that make it happen. It is the apparent absence ofsuch a link in magical events that makes scientists sceptical of them. Theoccultist responds to such scepticism by claiming that scientists refuse, or areunable, to spread their net of inquiry wide enough to encompass strange events.What is beyond dispute is that such events do occur.When we try to take account of occult events, and to devise some kind of theorythat helps to account for them, we discover an interesting thing. Such a theoryhas already existed for thousands of years. It does not matter whether we callit magic, occultism, shamanism, the Hermetic tradition as based on the works ofHermes Trismegistus. It all amounts to the same thing. Its basic assertion isthat there is a far more intimate connection between man and nature than we areinclined to believe. The world is full of unseen forces, and of laws of whosenature we have no inkling. Perhaps there is some strange medium that stretchesthroughout space—such as Eliphas Lévi’s astral light—that transmits these forcesas the air transmits sound waves.How do we make contact with such forces? The answer seems to be that you have towant to with an intense inner compulsion. In his autobiography, the painterOscar Kokoschka tells of how his mother, who was having tea with his aunt oneday in Prague, Czechoslovakia, suddenly leaped to her feet and announced thatshe must rush home because her youngest son was bleeding. The aunt tried topersuade her that her idea was nonsense, but his mother hurried home—and foundthat her son had cut his leg with a hatchet while trying to chop down a tree. Hewould certainly have bled to death if she had arrived any later. This story—andhundred of others like it equally well attested—indicates that strange powerscome into operation where our deepest desires or needs are involved. As we gothrough our everyday lives, we do not need to exercise much will power; butoccasionally, something stirs us to some really deep effort. It is this kind ofeffort that is likely to produce magical effects. The 20th-century poet RobertGraves has remarked that many young men use a form of unconscious ‘sorcery’ toseduce young women. This is another word for thought pressure.We could say, then, that organizations such as the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn set out to experiment with will power, and to explore the possibilities ofreaching deep subconscious levels of the will. Perhaps their magic was ahit-and-miss affair that worked only occasionally; but at least they were tryingto learn about the possibilities of the true will.The magic practiced by the members of the Golden Dawn was based on a number ofsimple principles. To begin with, they believed that certain basic symbols orideas have a deep meaning for all human beings. On one occasion, Mathers handedFlorence Farr a piece of cardboard with a geometrical symbol on it, and told herto close her eyes and place it against her forehead. She immediately saw in hermind’s eye a cliff top above the sea, with gulls shrieking. Mathers had shownher the water symbol from the Cabala. There is a close connection between suchsymbols and the theory of archetypes of the psychologist Carl Jung, who believedthat certain symbols are able to strike a chord in the unconscious mind of everyhuman being.The Golden Dawn taught its students to try to train their imagination, which isthe trigger of the will, and gain control over it. One of their exercises was tocontrol likes and dislikes until they could like something they normally hated,and hate something they usually liked. Another exercise was to attempt to seethe world through other people’s eyes rather than their own—in other words, tocompletely change their normal point of view. Many modern psychologists wouldagree that such exercises are valuable and healthy. They are, in fact, similarto exercises practised in yoga and other meditation disciplines.The Golden Dawn also made a genuine attempt to draw together all that was bestin the ancient magical traditions: Hermeticism, Cabalism, Enochian magic (basedon the Apocryphal Book of Enoch, which tells of the fall of the Angels and theirmagic practices), and such magic textbooks as The Key of Solomon, The Magic ofAbrahemelin the Mage, and the Grimoire of Pope Honorius.On the face of it, the Golden Dawn should have been a wholly beneficial andhealthy influence. Unfortunately, too many of its leading figures were driven bythe craving that has been the downfall of so many magicians: the will to power,not only over themselves but also over everyone else. Gerald Yorke, a friend ofAleister Crowley, concluded that the story of the Golden Dawn showed that ‘themajority of those who attempt to tread the occult path of power become thevictims of their creative imagination, inflate their egos, and fall’. There wasa great deal of infighting for the leadership of the Golden Dawn. Dr Westcottsaw himself as the leader, but MacGregor Mathers felt the position shouldrightly be his. Mathers claimed to be in direct touch with the Secret Chiefs,semi-divine spirits, who dictated new rituals to him through his wife as amedium. Then there was A. E. Waite, a learned American historian of magic. Hisinterests, however, were more mystical than magical, and he was not a veryinspiring person. Finally, there was Aleister Crowley, a remarkable and demonicmagician whose career brought ruin to many others as well as himself.Crowley was the son of a wealthy and puritanical brewer. He was born inLeamington near Stratford-upon-Avon in 1875. His birthplace gave him opportunityto remark with typical bombast and arrogance: ‘It is a strange coincidence thatone small county [Leamington and Stratford are in Warwickshire] should havegiven England her two greatest poets—for one must not forget Shakespeare.’ Itsounds like a joke, but in fact Crowley was convinced that he was a great poet.However, though his verse shows considerable talent, he lacked the disciplineand sense of language to be even a good poet.Crowley was a spoiled child who developed an intense dislike of the PlymouthBrethren, the strict religious sect to which his father belonged. He was alsoobsessed by sex. His first of numerous seductions occurred with a young servantwhen he was 14 years old. At university he wrote a great deal of poetry, whichhe published at his own expense. He also developed an incurable desire thatlasted all his life to shock respectable people. In his late teens he discoveredMathers’ translation of a book called The Kabbalah Unveiled, as well as a workby A. E. Waite on ceremonial magic. He quickly established contact with theGolden Dawn.By the time Crowley entered the Golden Dawn in 1898, the struggle for itscontrol had already been going on for some time. In 1891 Mathers had returnedfrom France to announce that he had met three of the Secret Chiefs in Paris, andhad had various magical secrets imparted to him. Dr Woodman died that year andfor the next six years there was a certain amount of tension within themovement. Dr Westcott resigned from the Order—apparently having been told by hissuperiors on the London Council that magic was not a suitable occupation for arespectable public official. Mathers spent a great deal of time in Paris workingon magical manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Nationale, so the struggle forleadership of the movement continued.In August 1899 Crowley rented a house in Boleskine, Scotland on the shores ofLoch Ness, conferred on himself the title ‘Laird of Boleskine’, donned a kilt,and proceeded to practise the magic of Abrahamelin the Mage—a system which, heclaimed, he had learned about in the writings of John Dee.In December 1899, convinced that it was time he moved up to a higher grade inthe Golden Dawn, Crowley went to London to demand initiation. This was refusedthrough the efforts of Yeats and various other senior members, who regarded himas an overgrown juvenile delinquent. Crowley therefore went to Paris andpersuaded Mathers to perform the necessary rituals. He also took the opportunityto stir up trouble, convincing Mathers that he had a revolt on his hands.Mathers sent him back to London with instructions to break into the Golden Dawnheadquarters, and to put new locks on all the doors. Yeats, Florence Farr, andthe other London initiates were enraged.The legal wrangle that ensued in 1901 broke up the original Golden Dawn thirteenyears after it had been founded. One group of members, under the leadership ofA. E. Waite, managed to continue for another four years, still callingthemselves the Golden Dawn. Another group, including Yeats, Florence Farr, andthe novelist Arthur Machen, was led until 1905 by Dr R. W. Felkin, who thenfounded a magical society called the Stella Matutina, or Morning Star. Finally,in the 1920s, a talented young medium and occultist who called herself DionFortune founded the Society of the Inner Light, based on Golden Dawn ritualsobtained from Mrs Mathers—Mathers himself having died in the influenza epidemicof 1918.The same year of the legal problems the Golden Dawn had received another blow inthe form of a sudden spate of unwelcome publicity. It happened when a couple ofconfidence tricksters who called themselves Mr and Mrs Horos were accused ofraping a 16-year-old girl. Mrs Horos had learned that it was supposed to havebeen Fräulein Sprengel who had given the Golden Dawn its charter. She went toParis and introduced herself to Mathers as Fräulein Sprengel. Oddly enough,Mathers was taken in—which could argue that he was not at that time aware thatFräulein Sprengel had been invented by Westcott. Mathers soon became suspiciousof the couple, whereupon Mrs Horos and her husband stole some of the rituals ofthe Golden Dawn and fled to London. There they launched into a career ofconfidence trickery based on a mixture of spurious occultism, extortion, andsex. When charged with their crimes they claimed to be leaders of the GoldenDawn. As a consequence, many of the most intimate secrets of the order were madepublic and sensationalised by the press. The publicity, combined with the powerstruggles within it, sealed the fate of the Golden Dawn.Crowley had decided to get away before the Horos scandal broke. Late in 1900 hehad gone to Mexico, where he studied the Cabala, practiced yoga, and—accordingto his own account—finally became a true magician. When he returned to Paris in1902 he tried to persuade Mathers to take up yoga. Mathers declined, and theirrelation became several degrees colder. Eventually it turned into hatred, withMathers and Crowley pronouncing magical curses on one another. Crowley claimedthat his curses were actually responsible for the death of Mathers.Back in England, Crowley married Rose Kelly, and they travelled to Ceylon andEgypt. They called themselves the Prince and Princess Chioa Khan. In Cairo,Crowley performed various rituals with the intention of invoking the Egyptiangod Horus. On April 8, 1904, he received instructions from his wife, who hadtaken to uttering strange messages while in a trance-like state, to go into aroom he had furnished as a temple. Suddenly he heard a disembodied voiceordering him to write. What Crowley wrote was an odd document called The Book ofthe Law, which became the cornerstone of his later teaching. He claimed that itwas dictated by Aiwass, one of the Secret Chiefs. Its basic teaching wasexpressed in the phrase: ‘Do what you will.’In 1905 Crowley went to the Himalayas to attempt the climb of Kanchenjunga,third highest mountain in the world. During the climb he quarrelled with therest of the team and, when they were buried in an avalanche, made no attempt tohelp them. Several were killed. He deserted his wife and baby in India where thebaby died of typhoid. Rose later became an alcoholic, and died insane. In amagazine called The Equinox Crowley began to publish the secret rituals of theGolden Dawn. Mathers took him to court for this, but lost his case.In 1912 Crowley received a communication from another magical organization, theOrder of the Temple of the Orient, reproaching him for publishing its secrets.Puzzled by the accusation, Crowley went to see Theodor Reuss, one of theO.T.O.’s leaders. It appeared that the secret in question was something calledsex magic. It arose from the system of yoga known as Tantra, which attempts touse the power of sexual energy to fuel the drive toward higher consciousness.The O.T.O. had, it seems, developed its own form of Tantric techniques. Crowleywas fascinated, and promptly availed himself of Reuss’s permission to set up anEnglish branch of the O.T.O. Magical ritual performed by Crowley often involvedsex magic—with his disciple Victor Neuberg it was an act of sodomy. Sex magicremained one of Crowley’s central enthusiasms for the rest of his life—thoughaddiction to heroin and cocaine lessened his sex drive in later years.In the United States during World War I Crowley had an endless series ofmistresses, each of whom he liked to call the ‘Scarlet Woman’. He undoubtedlyhad an exceptional sexual appetite, but it must also be said that he genuinelybelieved that sex magic heightened his self-awareness, and enabled him to tapincreasing profound levels of consciousness. At all events during this periodCrowley steadily developed a kind of hypnotic power that it is as difficult toaccount for as it is to describe. William Seabrook, an American writer on theoccult, witnessed the use of this power one day when he and Crowley were walkingon Fifth Avenue in New York City. Crowley began to follow a complete strangerwho was walking along the sidewalk. Crowley followed a few yards behind, keepingin perfect step with him. Suddenly, Crowley allowed his knees to buckle, anddropped momentarily to the ground. At exactly the same moment, the man he wasfollowing collapsed in precisely the same manner.By the early 1920s Crowley, who was suffering from asthma, was almostpermanently in debt. A legacy of $12,000 enabled him to move to a smallfarmhouse in Cefalu, Italy. He called it the Abbey of Thelema, which means ‘Dowhat you will’, began to practise magic, and invited disciples to join him. Heprovided apparently limitless quantities of drugs for anyone who wished to usethem, and attractive women devotees were expected to help Crowley practise hissex magic. Even with the legacy, however, the money problem remained pressing.Crowley wrote a novel called Diary of a Drug Fiend and started his Confessions,which he called his hagiography (the biography of a saint). He announced thatthe earth had now passed beyond Christianity and had entered the new epoch ofCrowleyanity. But when one of his disciples died after sacrificing a cat anddrinking its blood, the resulting newspaper scandal drove Crowley out of Sicily.The British press denounced him as ‘the wickedest man in the world’ and,although he loved the publicity, he soon discovered that his notoriety madepublishers shy away from his books. He deserted his disciples, one of whomcommitted suicide, and married again. His second wife, like the first, becameinsane. Hoping to make money, he sued the English sculptress Nina Hamnett forcalling him a black magician. But when witnesses described Crowley’s magic, thejudge stopped the case, declaring he had never heard such ‘dreadful, horrible,blasphemous, and abominable stuff.By the outbreak of World War II Crowley had added alcoholism to hisdrug-addiction even though his daily intake of heroin at the time would havekilled a dozen ordinary men. Every now and again he found rich disciples tosupport him until, inevitably, they lost patience with him. He retired to arooming house near Hastings in southern England, and died there in December 1947at the age of 72. John Symonds, a writer who had met him in his last years,later wrote his biography—a hilarious but often disturbing book. Other friends,notably Richard Cammell and Israel Regardie, wrote more sober and admiringaccounts of his career. But it was not until the magical revival that began inthe mid-1960s that Crowley’s reputation began to rise again. Nowadays more thana dozen of his books are in print, and a new generation ardently practises themagic rituals described in them. The Beast has finally achieved the fame hecraved. Nonetheless, and fortunately, the great age of Crowleyanity seems as faraway as ever.Occult powers seem to be a matter of national temperament. Second sight andtelepathy come naturally to the Irish. The Germans seem to produce more giftedastrologers than other nations. The Dutch have produced two of the most giftedclairvoyants of this century: Croiset and Hurkos. Russia tends to producemages—men or women who impress by their spiritual authority; no other nation hasa spiritual equivalent of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky or even of Rozanov,Merezhkovsky, Soloviev, Fedorov, Berdyaev, Shestov. Certainly no other nationhas come near to producing anyone like Madame Blavatsky, Grigory Rasputin orGeorge Gurdjieff. Each is completely unique.Grigory Rasputin’s body was taken from the frozen river Neva, in Petrograd, onJanuary 1, 1917. He had been murdered three days before, and was one of the mostnotorious figures in Russia. Now that he was dead, he would become a legend allover the world—a symbol of evil, cunning, and lust. If ever you see a magazinestory entitled ‘Rasputin, the Mad Monk’, you can be sure it will be full oflurid details of how Rasputin spent his days in drunken carousing, his nights insexual debauchery; how he deceived the czar and czarina into thinking he was amiracle worker; how he was the evil genius who brought about the RussianRevolution and the downfall of the Romanov dynasty. It is all untrue. Yet itmakes such a good story that there is little chance that Rasputin will everreceive justice. The truth about him is that he really was a miracle worker anda man of strange powers. He was certainly no saint—very few magicians are—andtales of his heavy drinking and sexual prowess are undoubtedly based on fact.But he was no diabolical schemer.Rasputin was born in the village of Pokrovskoe in 1870. His father was a fairlywell-to-do peasant. As a young man, Rasputin had a reputation for wildness untilhe visited a monastery and spent four months there in prayer and meditation. Forthe remainder of his life, he was obsessed by religion. He married at 19 andbecame a prosperous carter. Then the call came again; he left his family andtook to the road as a kind of wandering monk. When eventually he returned, hewas a changed man, exuding an extraordinarily powerful magnetism. The youngpeople of his village were fascinated by him. He converted one room in his houseinto a church, and it was always full. The local priest became envious of hisfollowing, however, and Rasputin was forced to leave home again.Rasputin had always possessed the gift of second sight. One day during hischildhood this gift had revealed to him the identity of a peasant who had stolena horse and hidden it in a barn. Now, on his second round of travels, he alsobegan to develop extraordinary healing powers. He would kneel by the beds of thesick and pray; then he would lay hands on them, and cure many of them. When hecame to what is now Leningrad, probably late in 1903, he already had areputation as a wonder worker. Soon he was accepted in aristocratic society inspite of his rough peasant manners.It was in 1907 that he suddenly became the power behind the throne. Three yearsbefore, Czarina Alexandra had given birth to a longed-for heir to the throne,Prince Alexei. But it was soon apparent that Alexei had inherited haemophilia, adisease that prevents the blood from clotting, and from which a victim may bleedto death even with a small cut. At the age of 3, the prince fell and bruisedhimself so severely that an internal hemorrhage developed. He lay in a fever fordays, and doctors despaired of his life. Then the czarina recalled the man ofGod she had met two years earlier, and sent for Rasputin. As soon as he came inhe said calmly: ‘Do not worry the child. He will be all right.’ He laid his handon the boy’s forehead, sat down on the edge of the bed, and began to talk to himin a quiet voice. Then he knelt and prayed. In a few minutes the boy was in adeep and peaceful sleep, and the crisis was over.Henceforward the czarina felt a powerful emotional dependence on Rasputin—adependence nourished by the thinly veiled hostility with which Alexandra, aGerman, was treated at court. Rasputin’s homely strength brought her a feelingof security. The czar also began to confide in Rasputin, who became a man ofinfluence at court. Nicholas II was a poor ruler, not so much cruel as weak, andtoo indecisive to stem the rising tide of social discontent. His opponents beganto believe that Rasputin was responsible for some of the czar’s reactionarypolicies, and a host of powerful enemies began to gather. On several occasionsthe czar had to give way to the pressure and order Rasputin to leave the city.On one such occasion, the young prince fell and hurt himself again. For severaldays he tossed in agony, until he seemed too weak to survive. The czarinadispatched a telegram to Rasputin, and he telegraphed back: ‘The illness is notas dangerous as it seems.’ From the moment it was received, the prince began torecover.World War I brought political revolution and military catastrophe to Russia. Itsoutbreak was marked by a strange coincidence: Rasputin was stabbed by a madwomanat precisely the same moment as the Archduke Franz Ferdinand was shot atSarajevo. Rasputin hated war, and might have been able to dissuade the czar fromleading Russia into the conflict. But he was in bed recovering from his stabwound when the moment of decision came.Rasputin’s end was planned by conspirators in the last days of 1916. He waslured to a cellar by Prince Felix Yussupov, a man he trusted. After feeding himpoisoned cakes, Yussupov shot him in the back; then Rasputin was beaten with aniron bar. Such was his immense vitality that he was still alive when themurderers dropped him through the hole in the ice into the Neva. Among hispapers was found a strange testament addressed to the czar. It stated that hehad a strong feeling he would die by violence before January 1, 1917, and thatif he were killed by peasants, the czar would reign for many years to come; but,if he were killed by aristocrats—as he was—then ‘none of your children orrelations will remain alive for more than two years’. He was right. The czar andhis family were all murdered in July 1918—an amazing example, among many, ofRasputin’s gift of precognition.Rasputin—in fact as well as in legend—was one of the most remarkable men inRussia. Also remarkable was his compatriot and near contemporary GeorgeiGurdjieff, who greatly influenced 20th-century occultism. Gurdjieff differs frommost other men of strange powers in one important respect: he was not primarilya mage or wonder worker, but a philosopher obsessed by the problems of humanfutility. Why are human beings so weak? Why is human consciousness so narrow?Why do we spend our lives in a state of dullness resembling sleep? Above all, bywhat practical methods can we break through to the great ‘source of power,meaning, and purpose’ buried deep within ourselves? It was to questions likethese that Gurdjieff addressed his life and work.Gurdjieff was born in America in 1873. His parents were Greek, but he wasRussian by nationality. From an early age he was intrigued by magic. One of theyoung men in his village could predict the future with astonishing accuracyafter sitting between two lighted candles and going into a trance. At about thistime Gurdjieff also witnessed a demonstration of the power of suggestion. He sawa boy who belonged to one of the many obscure local religious sects trapped inthe middle of a magic circle drawn on the ground by some children of thevillage. He was psychologically incapable of stepping beyond the perimeter ofthe circle.While still in his teens, Gurdjieff set out on what became twenty years oftravel in Asia, Africa, and Europe in search of the secret wisdom that, he wasconvinced, was somewhere to be found. He learned the techniques of yoga andother forms of meditation in Tibetan monasteries and in Arab mosques; he studiedhypnosis; he spent months with dervishes and with fakirs. In 1912, he returnedto Russia, ready to teach some of the mysteries he had learned. Among the closecircle of people who joined his group in Moscow was Peter Ouspensky, a youngoccultist and philosopher who was to become his most distinguished student.On the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917, Gurdjieff left Moscow for hisfamily home, then in the Caucasus. There he founded his Institute for theHarmonious Development of Man, and was soon joined by Ouspensky and others ofhis disciples. However, political conditions became too harsh in the Caucasusand, after attempting to settle in Istanbul and in Germany, Gurdjieffre-established the Institute at the Prieuré near Paris in 1922.Gurdjieff’s system of teaching was based on the idea that, under normalcircumstances, man is asleep, and that he is enslaved by a robot that controlsnot only his automatic functions but also much of his intellectual and emotionallife. Gurfjieff’s aim was to teach man how to outflank the robot by takingcontrol of the vital reserves that exist in all of us, but that most people cantap only in times of crisis. We can all remember occasions in our lives when,faced with exceptionally difficult and perhaps dangerous situations, we havebeen-forced—if only briefly—to excel ourselves physically or mentally. At themoment of success we feel marvellously alive. We are aware of a feeling offreedom—and rightly so, for the greatest freedom consists in our capacity tocontrol and direct our own most deep-seated powers. We say, with quite literaltruth, ‘I didn’t know I had it in me!’Gurdjieff’s method was to force his pupils constantly to extend their mental andphysical limits. They lived almost monastic lives at the Prieuré, working fromdawn to dusk and performing exercises designed to bring the mind, emotions, andbody into harmony and under control. The aim was to achieve a state thatGurdjieff called ‘self-remembering’—a state in which a person is not onlyintensely aware of his surroundings but also aware of himself observing andparticipating in them: a marriage of total inner and outer awareness. If youwant to test how difficult this is, try a simple exercise. Close your eyes anddirect your attention inward until you are aware only of your inner self. Nowopen your eyes and and direct your attention toward the outside world. Now tryto direct your attention to both at once—your inner self and the outside world.You will find that you can only do it for a few seconds at a time; then you‘forget’, and become aware only of either your inner self or the outside world.In certain moments of great excitement or intensity, however, you realise thatyou can maintain a state of self-remembering for much longer.Undoubtedly, Gurdjieff’s mastery of these disciplines gave him remarkable Psipowers—the way he could revitalise an exhausted follower by some inexplicabletransmission of energy is only one example. He was also able to establishtelepathic links with his followers. Ouspensky has recalled how, when they werein Finland, he began to hear Gurdjieff’s voice inside his chest, and was able tocarry on conversations with Gurdjieff who was in another part of the house. Atthe Prieuré Gurdjieffs pupils would give displays of telepathy for visitors,transmitting the names or shapes of various hidden objects from the audience tothe stage. Gurdjieff obviously had profound psychic gifts. One day he told hispupils that a newcomer, who was out of the room, was susceptible to a certainchord of music. When the person came in he struck the chord on the piano, andshe immediately underwent a kind of hysterical fit.There are many stories of Gurdjieff’s fund-raising skills that demonstrate notonly his special psychological insight but also his sense of humour. Before oneof his parties to raise money in New York, Gurdjieff asked Fritz Peters to teachhim all the most obscene four-letter words he knew. When a large number ofrespectable and rich New Yorkers arrived, Gurdjieff began to talk to them abouthis ideas, gradually introducing more and more talk of sex. Finally hisconversation consisted almost entirely of four-letter words. His guests relaxed,and then began to flirt with one another. Eventually, all inhibitions gone, theyproceeded to behave with total abandon. Suddenly Gurdjieff stood up in thecentre of the room, thunderously demanded their attention, and then pointed outthat he had revealed to them something about themselves that they had neversuspected. Surely, he asked, that was worth a large contribution to hisinstitute? At the end of the evening, he was some thousands of dollars richer.During his lifetime Gurdjieff did not publish any books on the techniques of histeaching, and his pupils were bound to secrecy on the subject. Since his deathin Paris in 1949, however, many of his works have been published, and there hasbeen a flood of memoirs by disciples and admirers. Gurdjieff was in almost everyrespect the antithesis of Aleister Crowley. Whereas Crowley craved publicity,Gurdjieff shunned it. Crowley was forgotten for two decades after his death;Gurdjieff, on the contrary, has become steadily better known, and his influencecontinues to grow. One of the main reasons for this is that there was so littleof the charlatan about him. He is no cult figure with hordes of gullibledisciples. What he has to teach makes an appeal to the intelligence, and can befully understood only by those who are prepared to make a serious effort.Nevertheless, Gurdjieff undoubtedly understood all the tricks of thoughtpressure. One of the most typical stories of him is told by the writer andtraveler Rom Landau. One day, Landau was sitting in a restaurant with anattractive lady novelist. She was facing away from Gurdjieff, who was sitting onthe other side of the restaurant. Suddenly she turned as if she had been struck,and her eyes met Gurdjieff’s. Then, blushing, she turned away. Later sheadmitted to Landau that Gurdjieff had somehow ‘struck her through her sexualcenter’, including a powerful sexual response as if with an intimate caress.Like Rasputin, Gurdjieff was no saint in his personal relations with women.Unlike Rasputin, however, he knew how to direct and control his extraordinarypowers. His disciples regard him as one of the greatest men of the 20th century,and it is not necessary to be a disciple of Gurdjieff’s to think that they maybe right.Among the most remarkable—and at present underestimated—magicians of the 20thcentury is the brilliantly talented writer who called herself Dion Fortune.Little is known of her childhood, as her biographer, Alan Richardson, admits.1Born in Llandudno on December 6, 1890, the only child of a lawyer, and of amother who became an ardent Christian Scientist, Violet Mary Firth seems to havebeen an introverted child who began to have ‘visions’ at the age of 4. (Shelater came to believe they were of past lives.) She was also sensitive topsychic phenomena from early childhood. Another well-known psychic, PhoebePayne, has described how as a child she always saw pretty ‘auras’ surroundingflowers, and was surprised to discover later that they were invisible to mostpeople. Violet Firth found that she was able to sense people’s hidden thoughtsand feelings. From the beginning, she ‘walked in two worlds’, and laterdeveloped into a good medium.At the age of 20 in 1911 she became a teacher in a private school. The principalwas a highly domineering woman—a power-hungry bully who had studied the occultin India. After several fierce arguments with the principal, Dion Fortunedecided to quit her job. A colleague advised her to leave without telling theprincipal, saying that if she did not, she would never get away. Against thisadvice she told her superior. The principal said she was welcome to leave if shefirst admitted that she was incompetent and had no self-confidence. Dion Fortuneindignantly denied the charges. The principal then fixed her with her eyes andrepeated the statement hundreds of times for four hours.Eventually some deep instinct warned Dion Fortune to pretend to give way, and tobeg her principal’s pardon. The older woman then relented and let her go. Butthe damage was done: Dion Fortune was a physical and mental wreck for the nextthree years. After more than a year of the illness, she later wrote, ‘my bodywas like an electric battery that has been completely discharged’. Apsychologist’s diagnosis would probably be that the principal had used a kind ofhypnotic power to deflate her self-esteem, to make her feel helpless andaccident-prone. The effect was to drain her vital reserves, as Gurdjieff wouldhave put it, so that the slightest effort exhausted her. She came to theconclusion that the woman had damaged her with a ‘psychic attack’, causing herastral body to leak vital energy. She plunged deep into the study of occultismas an antidote. Perhaps the most interesting part of her account of thisexperience is her statement that the principal had used not merely hypnotism butalso telepathic suggestion—in other words, thought pressure.It seems to have been this encounter that decided her to become a student ofpsychoanalysis, which was just then arousing much hostile attention amongst theBritish medical fraternity. In Psychic Self Defense, her story of the battlewith the domineering principal, she states briefly: ‘I took up the subject andbecame a student, and eventually a lecturer, at a clinic that was founded inLondon.’ This was the Medico-Psychological Clinic in Brunswick Square. She goeson to explain that she soon noticed that some patients left her psychologicallydrained, and that when one of the nurses told her that some patients seemed to‘take it out’ of the electrical machines, and could absorb high voltages withoutturning a hair, she began to wonder whether she was not dealing with some vitalforce that was quite distinct from Freud’s libido. She became convinced thatsome people are ‘psychic vampires’—a conclusion in accordance with theprinciples of ‘occultism’.When she discovered that the Theosophical Society had founded a club not farfrom the clinic in Brunswick Square, she joined it—not, as she explains, becauseshe was interested in Theosophy, but because it was a convenient place to get acheap meal. As a Freudian, she was contemptuous of the doctrines of theTheosophists; but when one day she decided to attend a meditation class—‘in aspirit of mischief’—she was startled to observe in front of her eyes a clearimage of a garden with blue plants. When the leader of the group announced thatshe was trying to transfer the image of delphiniums, she realised that some kindof thought-transference had taken place. Feeling that thought-reading would bean admirable gift for a psychoanalyst, she became a regular member of themeditation class. And as she recognised the reality of thought-transference, shealso began to feel increasingly dissatisfied with the narrow materialism of theFreudians. With typical honesty, she decided to give up psychoanalysis and jointhe Land Army, which she felt to be a more useful job in war time. She wasplaced in charge of a laboratory where research was being conducted into food.Her job involved hours of waiting while bacteria brewed in an incubator. And inthe long hours of silence, her vision turned inward. The result, she explains,was the sudden opening of ‘astral sight’, ‘which gave me one of the frights ofmy life’. With a sense of being helplessly swept into something she failed tounderstand, she hurried along to the library of the Theosophical Society inTavistock Square, and borrowed Annie Besant’s book The Ancient Wisdom. Suddenly,she was converted to a belief in the Masters (although she always maintainedthat Madame Blavatsky was stretching the truth when she insisted that she hadseen them in the flesh). For the next ten days she seemed to live in a strange,twilit world (which she would later identify as the ‘astral plane’ of theCabala). On the tenth night she had a dream of tremendous vividness, in whichshe stood in the presence of the Master Jesus, and other Masters. In her dream,she was accepted as a pupil. When she woke up, she was convinced of the realityof her experience. A second Master she later identified as the Comte de StGermain.Now her problem was to understand what was happening to her. She read R.M.Bucke’s classic Cosmic Consciousness, and Madame Blavatsky’s Isis Unveiled. Shealso met an Irishman named Theodore William Moriarty, a Freemason and occultistwho became her teacher in magic. (She later fictionalised him as her ‘psychicdetective’ Doctor Taverner.) Soon she had become a member of a group of femaledisciples who studied with him at a house in Bishops Stortford and another inEversley, near Wokingham. More extraordinary psychic events took place there,which she describes in Psychic Self Defense. It seems, though, that Violet Firthwas not much liked by her fellow disciples, who regarded her as ‘pushing’.While she was still a member of the Moriarty group, she renewed acquaintancewith a lady named Maiya Curtis-Webb, whom she had known since childhood. She wasa ‘walking encyclopedia of occultism’, and it was she who introduced VioletFirth to J.W. Brodie-Innes of the Golden Dawn. The result was that, in 1919,Violet Firth was initiated into the London Temple of the Golden Dawn, where shewas given the magical name ‘Deo, non Fortune’, which she later transmuted intoDion Fortune.It was at the London Temple that she met Moina Mathers, the widow of MacGregorMathers, who was still running a remnant of the Golden Dawn. Mrs Mathers atfirst liked the attractive younger woman, and even agreed when Dion Fortuneproposed forming a group of occultists more open to the general public—an ideadirectly opposed to the secrecy of the original Order. However, after DionFortune had written a number of books and articles on occultism, Mrs Mathersbegan to feel threatened by the energy and talent of the newcomer. It seemsprobable that Mrs Mathers hoped to turn the Golden Dawn into a source of income.In any case, Mrs Mathers ordered her to stop publicising the secrets of theOrder. According to Dion Fortune, when she ignored the other woman’s wishes, MrsMathers launched a black-magic attack on her. The opening salvo seems to havebeen a plague of black cats: dozens of them invaded Dion Fortune’s house, andtwo of her friends were bothered by the odour of cats in their respectiveoffices several miles away. Then one morning Dion Fortune saw a giant catwalking down the stairs toward her. As she stared, terrified, it vanished—andshe realized that someone was using a kind of telepathic hypnotism on her. Anhour later, the street outside her home was filled with dozens of howling blackcats.Dion Fortune’s major struggle occurred when she made an astral journey. Herdescription of this is interesting because it gives us some insight into whatmagicians actually do when they visit the astral plane. A number of herfollowers formed a circle around her as she lay down and went into a lighttrance. ‘In the language of psychology,’ she wrote, ‘it is autohypnosis by meansof a symbol.’ (Bear in mind that the Golden Dawn believed certain symbols areuniversal archetypes from the racial unconscious. Each of these symbols has aprecise meaning, and will therefore elicit a particular response.) ‘The trainedinitiate, therefore, does not wander on the astral plane like an uneasy ghost,but comes and goes by well-known corridors.’ In other words, it is essentially avoyage into inner space, which the occultist believes to have a geography asprecise as the world we live in, and to be common territory, like the worldoutside us, in which separate individuals may sometimes meet.As soon as she had entered this inner space, Dion Fortune became aware of MrsMathers in her magical robes, barring her path. Mrs Mathers was of a highergrade in magic than Dion Fortune and, therefore, theoretically, stronger. ‘Thereensued a battle of wills in which I experienced the sensation of being whirledthrough the air and falling from a great height, and found myself back in mybody.’ When she emerged from her trance, her followers were in disarray: she hadsomersaulted across the room, bowling them over, and was lying in a corner.Realising that if she were to continue as a magician she had to return to thefight, she ordered the group to reform the circle. After invoking the SecretChiefs, she went into a trance. ‘This time, there was a short sharp struggle,and I was through. I had the Vision of the Inner Chiefs and returned. The fightwas over. I have never had any trouble since.’ That night when she undressed togo to bed, Dion Fortune found that her back was scratched—as if clawed by a hugecat.Of course this story could be pure invention. Yet, in one important respect,that is not the question at issue. We have no way of determining whether thestory is objectively true—whether Dion Fortune actually journeyed the corridorsof the astral plane. The question is whether the account has its own kind ofintegrity, and whether the experience was different in kind from an ordinarynightmare. Dion Fortune, like other magicians, certainly took the concept of themagical attack very seriously. She described in one of her books how one of herfollowers, Netta Fornario, was killed by an ‘astral attack’. Miss Fornario hadgone to the Holy Isle of Iona in western Scotland to practice astral travel. Oneday she seemed panic-stricken and told her landlady that she was being attackedtelepathically—her silver jewellery had all turned black overnight. The next dayher body was found some miles away, dressed only in a magical robe. The soles ofher feet were lacerated as if she had run over sharp stones. She had died of aheart attack, and Dion Fortune was convinced that Mrs Mathers was responsible.It was inevitable that Mrs Mathers and Dion Fortune would go their separateways. In 1924, Dion Fortune founded the Community (later, Fraternity) of theInner Light; originally conceived as a part of the Golden Dawn, it assumed itsown identity, four years later, with Dion Fortune as its ‘Warden’. Her innerMaster was now Melchizedec, ‘Lord of Flame and also of Mind’, and afterinitiation her pupils became High Priests of the Order of Melchizedec. OtherMasters were Thomas Erskine, a Lord Chancellor at the time of Dr Johnson, SirThomas More, and—oddly enough—Socrates. She came to believe that Socrates wasresponsible for much of her magical magnum opus, The Cosmic Doctrine.In the year of The Cosmic Doctrine, 1927, she married a handsome and charmingWelshman, Thomas Penry Evans, who was a doctor and two years her junior—shecalled him Merl, after Merlin. In 1930, she leased a house called The Belfry inWest Halkin Street, near Belgrave Square. She ran her ‘magical school’ at ahouse in Glastonbury, Chalice Orchard (later bought by the Arthurian scholarGeoffrey Ashe), and gave lectures at 3 Queensborough Terrace in London. Duringthe next twelve years she wrote her novels The Winged Bull (1935), The Goat-FootGod (1936), The Sea Priestess (1938)—regarded as her masterpiece—and Moon Magic(1939.) They have been described as the finest novels about magic ever written,and there is no doubt that they are works of extraordinary fascination—certainlyamong the best fiction ever written by an ‘occultist’.She also tells us a great deal in the novels about the gradual break-up of hermarriage. There seem to have been many reasons—her lack of interest in physicalsexuality, her increasing bulk (it seems to be a characteristic of mediums thatthey put on weight), her autocratic temperament. In 1938, her husband went toBarcelona to help the Republican government with the nutritional problems ofchildren; on his return, he met a younger woman, and asked his wife for adivorce, which she granted.During the war years, her life became increasingly dark. One of her leadingdisciples, Charles Seymour, defected—she regarded him as a great magician.Grandiose schemes for a national occult movement came to nothing. She becameconvinced that a black magician who was a member of Hitler’s entourage waslaunching a magical assault on her, and her health declined.In 1945, using the name ‘Mrs Matthews,’ she asked for an appointment with aJungian psychiatrist, Dr Laurence Bendit. (Dion Fortune had become a ‘Jungian’,having long ago abandoned Freud.) She told him she felt she was approaching acrisis in her life, and wanted analysis. Bendit was struck by her keenintelligence. She described a number of dreams full of mythological images, butall, he noted, with an underlying tone of darkness. One day, as they weretalking about the Cabala, Dr Bendit mentioned that the only book he had read onit was Dion Fortune’s The Mystical Qabalah, and went on to make some criticismof her interpretation of Tiphereth. His patient then told him: ‘I am DionFortune.’ (The book Dr Bendit mentioned is generally acknowledged to be her mostimportant contribution to the theory of ritual magic.)Mrs Bendit had seen Dion Fortune passing through the waiting room, and had askedthe identity of ‘that strange woman’. When her husband asked why she wanted toknow, Mrs Bendit remarked: ‘I couldn’t help noticing she was just a burned-outshell.’At Christmas, as she made another appointment, Dr Bendit had a sudden intuitivecertainty that she would not keep it. And when he sent her cheque to his bank inthe New Year, it was returned stamped ‘Drawer deceased’. What had seemed ageneral malaise had suddenly flared into acute leukaemia.It seems appropriate that Dion Fortune should be the last ‘great magician’ ofthe 20th century. More than any other, she has left a personal record of herselfin her works, and these are unique in that they reveal the inner life of an‘adept’ in such intimate detail. They make it clear that the destiny of amagician is at the same time one of the most fascinating and one of the mostdifficult in the world. 1. Priestess, The Life and Magic of Dion Fortune, Aquarian Press 1987."},{"pageContent":"13The Mystery of TimeIT WAS THE LATE ‘Professor’ Joad who, in his Guide to Modern Thought, used thephrase ‘the undoubted queerness of time’. The case he refers to was recorded bytwo maiden ladies, Charlotte Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain, successive principalsof an Oxford college, in their book An Adventure, published in 1911. On August10, 1901, the two ladies visited the Trianon park at Versailles and weresurprised to encounter a number of people in 18th century dress. Two ‘gardeners’gave them directions, and a man who hurried past them warned them not to take acertain path. They passed a woman in old-fashioned dress who was drawing, butonly Miss Moberly saw her. Both ladies felt oddly depressed and experienced adream-like sensation. They went into the Petit Trianon, followed a wedding partyat a distance, then went back to their hotel for tea. A week later, when MissMoberly was describing the visit in a letter, the two ladies compared notes anddecided that there had been something odd about the afternoon. Miss Jourdainwrote her own detailed account. The following January, she returned alone toVersailles on a cold, rainy afternoon. Again she experienced ‘the old eeriefeeling’; ‘it was as if I had crossed a line and was suddenly in a circle ofinfluence’. She saw two labourers in bright tunics and hoods loading a cart;when she looked back a second later, they had vanished, although she could see along way in all directions. She heard the rustling of silk dresses around herand heard voices, but she saw no one.When the two ladies returned to the gardens three years later, they foundeverything totally changed. The trees had vanished; so had a rustic bridge, aravine, a cascade and a ‘kiosk’. Convinced now that they had seen the place asit was in the reign of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, they studied books on theperiod and concluded that they had actually seen historical personages of theperiod just before the Revolution, and that the woman seen by Charlotte Moberlycould well have been Marie Antoinette. After publication of their book in 1911,three people who had lived in a house overlooking the park at Versailles toldthem that they had experienced the same kind of thing so often that they hadceased to pay any attention to it.In 1938, a member of the Society for Psychical Research, J. E. Sturge-Whiting,strongly criticised the account of the two ladies. He had examined the groundsand concluded that they had simply followed paths that still exist on the firstoccasion and failed to locate them on their second visit. In 1965, PhilippeJullian published a biography of Count Robert de Montesquiou (the dandy on whomProust based Baron de Charlus), which described how Montesquiou took a housenear Versailles in the early 1890s and often spent whole days in the park. Hisfriend Mme de Greffulhe organised a fancy-dress party in the Dairy. And this,remarks Jullian in an aside, could easily explain the ‘adventure’ of the twoEnglish ladies. ‘Perhaps . . . the “ghosts” . . . were, quite simply, MmeGreffulhe, dressed as a shepherdess, rehearsing an entertainment with somefriends . . .’The explanation sounds plausible, and together with Sturge-Whiting’s theory ofthe paths, it so convinced Dame Joan Evans, the literary executor of the twoladies, that she decided to allow An Adventure to go out of print. Yet on closerexamination, the two theories still leave nine-tenths of the incidentsunexplained. Sturge-Whiting fails to explain away the topographical problem.Charlotte Moberly says quite clearly about her 1904 visit:‘From this point [the guard house] everything was changed . . . We came directlyto the gardener’s house, which was quite different in appearance from thecottage described by Miss Jourdain in 1901 . . . Beyond the gardener’s house wasa parterre with flower beds and a smooth lawn of many years’ careful tendance.It did not seem to be the place where we had met the garden officials. We spenta long time looking for the old paths. Not only was there no trace of them, butthe distances were contracted . . . The kiosk was gone; so was the ravine andthe little cascade which had fallen from a height above our heads, and thelittle bridge over the ravine . . .’And so on for several more detailed pages. Which suggests that either the ladieswere exaggerating, or Sturge-Whiting must be wrong.Philippe Jullian apparently failed to check the date of the Versaillesadventure. Montesquiou moved to Versailles in the early 1890s and moved again—toNeuilly—in 1894, so the fancy-dress party took place at least seven years tooearly for the English ladies to have seen a rehearsal.Finally, Joan Evans makes no attempt to explain what happened on Miss Jourdain’s1902 visit, when she saw the disappearing carters. On this occasion, MissJourdain again saw the ‘old’ Versailles, as on her first visit. During the nexttwo years, she returned many times and must have become fairly familiar with thegeography of the park; on all these occasions she found the place completelychanged and ‘modernised’.And so on the Versailles adventure remains one of the most baffling andincongruous incidents in the history of modern psychical research.Joad concludes: ‘While admitting that the hypothesis of the present existence ofthe past is beset with difficulties of a metaphysical character . . . I thinkthat it indicates the most fruitful basis for the investigation of theseintriguing experiences.’ What exactly did he mean by ‘the present existence ofthe past’? He never bothered to explain. But the phrase seems to suggest anotion that is not too difficult to grasp: that the past is somehow alive andstill among us, like the voice of Caruso preserved on gramophone records.In fact, as we have seen, Joseph Rodes Buchanan, and his disciple WilliamDenton, meant roughly the same thing by ‘psychometry’ (Chapter 3[../Text/08_chapter03.html]), and Denton even coined the phrase ‘telescope intothe past’. But then, psychometry is not literally the ability to see into thepast—any more than a gramophone stylus is a time machine that can transport youback into the life of Caruso. If the faculty exists—and there is much convincingevidence that it does—then it could be explained simply as a very highlydeveloped ability to ‘read’ the history of objects, rather as Sherlock Holmeswas able to tell Watson the history of his alcoholic brother from the evidenceof his watch. And this, I suspect, is not precisely what Joad meant by the‘undoubted queerness of time’. For, in the section before his account of the‘adventure’ of Miss Moberly and Miss Jourdain, he discusses J.W. Dunne’s book AnExperiment with Time; and Dunne’s book is an account of how he had certain clearand detailed dreams of the future. If Dunne’s book is to be believed—and, again,he had a reputation for integrity—then he dreamed of such events as the greatMartinique earthquake some weeks before it happened. And this is utterlyunexplainable on any ‘scientific’ theory of time, no matter how abstract andcomplex: the scientists’ view of time dictates that the future cannot affect thepast. I may be able to explain certain personal premonitions—say, the death of arelative—in logical terms (i.e., I knew he was ill and suffered from a badheart), but to dream of a volcanic explosion on an island you know nothing aboutis obviously an event of a different order.There, then, is the problem. The files of the Society for Psychical Research andthe College of Psychic Studies are full of convincing cases or premonitions ofthe future and curious visions of the past. The two examples that follow bothconcern the same man: Air-Marshal Sir Victor Goddard.In 1935, when he was a Wing Commander, Goddard was sent to visit a disused FirstWorld War airfield at Drem, near Edinburgh. It proved to be in a state ofdilapidation, with disintegrating hangars and cracked tarmac. Cattle grazed onthe old airfield. Later that day Goddard took off in his Hawker Hart biplanefrom Turnhouse, Edinburgh, to head for home. But he soon encountered thick cloudand heavy rain, and as he tried to descend below the cloud ceiling the planespun for a few moments out of control. He managed to straighten out close to theground—so close that he almost hit a woman who was running with a pram. Ahead ofhim was the Firth of Forth, and Goddard decided to head for Drem airfield to gethis bearings.It was still raining heavily as he crossed the airfield boundary. Then an oddthing happened: he suddenly found himself in bright sunlight. And Drem airfieldwas no longer an overgrown field, but a neat, orderly place, with four yellowplanes parked in front of open hangar doors and mechanics in blue overallswalking around. Both these things surprised Goddard, for in those days all RAFplanes were painted with aluminium and mechanics wore khaki overalls. Moreoverthe mechanics did not even glance up as the plane roared a few feet overhead:Goddard had the feeling that they did not see him. He also had the feeling of‘something ethereal about the sunlight’.When he landed he told his immediate superior about his ‘hallucination’, and wasadvised to lay off the whisky. So Goddard said nothing about his ‘vision’ in hisofficial report. It was not until four years later, when war broke out, that hereceived an even greater shock. Next time he saw Drem it had been transformedinto the airfield of his vision. The ‘trainers’ were now painted yellow and themechanics wore blue overalls. A monoplane he had failed to recognise four yearsearlier he now identified as a Miles Magister.Recordings from the past are a reality, as every film and gramophone recorddemonstrates. But a recording from the future sounds preposterous. Even if weassume it was a hallucination, and not a ‘time-slip’ into the future, it remainsjust as impossible.The second episode concerns a glimpse of the more immediate future.In 1946 Sir Victor Goddard was attending a party given in his honour inShanghai. He was talking to some friends when he overheard someone behind himannouncing that he—Goddard— was dead. He turned round and found himself lookinginto the face of a British naval commander, Captain Gerald Gladstone. Gladstoneimmediately recognised him, and looked appalled. ‘I’m terribly sorry! I doapologize!’ ‘But what made you think I was dead?’ ‘I dreamt it.’Gladstone went on to describe his dream. He had seen the crash of a transportpassenger plane, perhaps a Dakota, on a rocky coast: it had been driven down bya terrible snowstorm. In addition to its RAF crew the plane also carried threecivilians, two men and a women: they had emerged from the plane, but Air MarshalGoddard had not. Gladstone had awakened with a strong conviction that Goddardwas dead, and throughout that day he expected to hear the news.Goddard was not too worried: he was due to fly to Tokyo in a Dakota, but therewould be no civilians on board. He and Gladstone spent a pleasant half hour orso discussing Dunne’s theory of time. But during dinner there were alarmingdevelopments. A Daily Telegraph journalist asked if he could beg a lift toJapan. Then the Consul General told Goddard that he had received orders toreturn to Tokyo immediately and asked if he could travel too; he also asked ifthey could find room for a female secretary. With deep misgivings, Goddardagreed. And when the plane took off from Shanghai, he personally had no doubtwhatever that he was about to die.The Dakota was caught in heavy cloud over mountains—another detail CaptainGladstone had ‘seen’—then ran into a fierce snowstorm. Finally the pilot wasforced to crash-land on the rocky coastline of an island off the shore of Japan.But Gladstone proved to be mistaken about Goddard’s death: everyone on boardsurvived.Such incidents flatly contradict everything that human beingsknow—intuitively—about time. The one thing that is absolutely certain about ourworld is that everything that is born ends eventually by dying, and that, inbetween these two events, it gets steadily older. Time is irreversible. With theaid of a tape recorder, I can replay the voice of someone who is dead; but, if Ihappen to feel guilty about the way I have treated him, there is absolutely noway in which I can go back in time and ‘unhappen’ what has happened. We all knowthis. It is not only a fundamental part of our experience; it seems to be a lawof the Universe.Now when, in 1895, H.G. Wells wrote his science-fiction story The Time Machinehe introduced his readers to an exciting and fascinating new hypothesis. Time,says Wells’s Time Traveller, is nothing more than a fourth dimension of space.Consider photographs of a man at the ages of 8, 15, 17, 23, and so on. These arebasically three-dimensional representations of a four-dimensional being, ratheras you might take slices or cross-sections of a length of soft clay. What thisimplies is that each cross-section is in some way false or, at least,misleading—exactly as those flat Egyptian portraits of solid human beings aremisleading. Seen from the perspective of the fourth dimension, a man is a singlechunk of matter stretching from one point in time to another, not athree-dimensional chunk of matter moving from one moment to the next.One of the Time Traveller’s companions objects that we cannot move about intime; whereupon he makes an interesting reply: ‘You are wrong to say that wecannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident veryvividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, asyou say. I jump back for a moment. Of course, we have no means of staying backfor any length of Time, any more than a savage or animal has of staying six feetabove the ground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in thisrespect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he nothope that ultimately he may even be able to stop or accelerate his drift alongthe Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way . . . ?’The Traveller, of course, claims to have invented a machine for doing preciselythis. But the interesting point of the above explanation is that it suggests aquite different method of time travel. Wells says that when we recall an eventvividly, we move back into the past for a moment; but we have no capacity tostay there. Time, he says, in another paragraph, is essentially mental travelfrom the cradle to the grave. What Wells is suggesting is that time travel is amental faculty we already possess, but to a very slight extent.Wells himself apparently forgot that important suggestion, thrown off casuallyin the opening chapter of The Time Machine. And the remainder of his story—withits mechanical flight through time—raises the kind of paradoxical questions thathave become a commonplace of science fiction ever since. For example, as hemoves into the future, he sees his housekeeper come into the room and moveacross it with the speed of a bullet: for now he is moving more swiftly throughtime, her action happens in a shorter space of time. If he had been goingbackwards in time, he would have seen her move across the room backwards, heractions reversed. But then, would he not also have seen himself, as he was a fewminutes before, or the day or month before? In fact, what was to prevent himhalting the Time Machine and going to shake hands with his ‘self of yesterday?Or why should he not go forward to his self of tomorrow and ask him what horsewon the Grand National? He could even ask his self of tomorrow and his self ofyesterday to climb into the Time Machine and accompany him back to today fordinner . . .And already we see the emergence of the paradox. What right has the TimeTraveller to regard his own time as the present, and his own ‘self as the TimeTraveller? Wells sidesteps this question by sending the Traveller backwards orforwards in time beyond his own life span. So if he went back to 1812 to meetNapoleon or 1066 to meet King Harold, it would sound perfectly logical, ifunbelievable. But if the Time Traveller consists of millions of ‘selves’, onefor every split second of his life, then the same goes for every other personand object in the Universe. The trouble with this is that every one of thesemultiple beings would have its own past and future, since each is a separateindividual. (For example, if the Time Traveller invited his selves of yesterdayand tomorrow for dinner, each would proceed to travel into the future separatelyas three separate beings.) You end up with an absurd vision of amultiple-multiple Universe in which everyone is fragmented into an infinitenumber of selves . . .It is, of course, mere fiction, so we can forgive its shortcomings. But then,the actual experience of time travel is not mere fiction. I suggested, forexample, that the Time Traveller of today might pay a call on his self oftomorrow to enquire the winner of the Grand National; he could then go back tohis own time and place a large bet on it . . . But such events have, in fact,occurred. In 1976 I made a television programme for BBC2 about John Godley, LordKilbracken, who, as an Oxford undergraduate, dreamed winners of horse races, andmade several useful sums of money through his curious ability. Peter Fairley,the science correspondent of Independent Television, had a similar experience.In a BBC broadcast, he told how, as he was driving to work one day in 1965, heheard a request on the car radio for a Mrs Blakeney; he had just driven throughthe village of Blakeney, and a few minutes later, heard a reference toanother—totally unconnected—Blakeney. At the office he heard the name again,this time a horse running in the Derby. He backed it and it won. From then on,he explained, he could pick winners merely by looking down a list of horses; thewinner would ‘leap off the page’ at him. He said that as soon as he began tothink about it and worry about it, the faculty vanished . . .Now this is altogether closer to Wells’s suggestion of Time Travel as a purelymental faculty. And it is certainly far more convincing than the versioninvolving time machines.Let us, then, agree that the usual notion of time travel, derived from Wells, isabsurd and self-contradictory. In that sense, the past is the past and thefuture is the future, and we can never hope to explore either with the aid of aTime Machine. For in this sense, time does not exist; it is a semanticmisunderstanding. I tried to explain the reason for this in a passage of my bookThe Occult. Suppose people were born on moving trains and stayed on them untilthey died. They might invent a word to describe the everyday sensation ofscenery flowing past the window, a word like ‘zyme’. When the train stops instations they would say that zyme has halted; if the train reverses, they wouldsay zyme is flowing backwards. But if someone spoke of zyme as an entity, theywould obviously be committing a logical error; it consists of many things—arailway carriage, scenery, motion and so on. The same goes for time. It isbasically a process which involves physical objects. If you think of acompletely ‘empty’ Universe, or a completely static Universe, it would obviouslyhave no time. This is why Wells’s time machine is an absurdity.If Peter Fairley could really predict which horse would win a race, then thereis clearly something wrong with our human notion of time; for the idea that thefuture has already taken place—which it must have done if you are to ‘know’it—is self-contradictory, a paradox. But then, our minds are a paradox inprecisely the same sense. You and I apparently exist in a solid,three-dimensional Universe: we are physical objects. Then where, precisely, ismy mind? Inside my head? ‘Realist’ philosophers have tried hard to explain mindin physical terms—the brain and the nervous system—but they end with a staticmodel, rather like a computer. And a computer needs to be worked by somebody.When I struggle with an intellectual or emotional problem, I am aware of anelement that I call ‘me’ trying to get the best out of the computer. This beingcan look on quite detachedly while ‘I’ am flooded with a powerful emotion. Itapplies the accelerator or brake to my moods and feelings. It seems to exist ina dimension apart from this physical world we live in.To me, these considerations suggest that these two paradoxical concepts—time andthe mind—are closely connected. Our bodies exist in the realm of one-way time,but our minds do not. As Wells points out, when I become absent-minded, my mindgoes ‘elsewhere’. But on the whole, these visits to other times and places arefar less vivid than our everyday lives. Yet this is not so much a limitation ofour minds as of the ‘computer’ they use, the brain.For example, there is an important experience of the philosopher J.B. Bennettdescribed in his autobiography Witness. Bennett tells how, when he was stayingat the Gurdjieff Institute at Fontainebleau, he woke up one morning feelingexceptionally weak from dysentery, but nevertheless forced himself to get up.Later that morning he took part in some Gurdjieff exercises— incrediblydifficult and complex physical movements. One by one, the other disciplesdropped out; but, in spite of extreme fatigue and discomfort, Bennett forcedhimself to go on. Then, quite suddenly, ‘I was filled with an influx of animmense power. My body seemed to have turned into light.’ All fatigue vanished.When he went outside, he decided to test this power by digging at a rate hecould not ordinarily maintain for more than a few minutes; he was able tocontinue for half an hour without fatigue. He walked out into the forest, anddecided to try to test his control over his emotions. He willed himself to feelastonishment. ‘Instantly, I was overwhelmed with amazement, not only at my ownstate, but at everything I looked at or thought of.’ The thought of ‘fear’ fillhim with immense dread; the thought of ‘joy’ filled him with rapture; thethought of ‘love’ flooded him with a tremendous tenderness and compassion.Finally, bewildered by this new ability to feel anything he liked, he willed itto go away, and it instantly vanished.Now what is involved here is obviously what William James calls ‘vitalreserves’. James points out that we can feel exhausted, push ourselves beyondthe exhaustion, and suddenly feel full of energy again. It is the phenomenon of‘second wind’. It seems that we possess vast energy reserves that we fail tomake use of. But a sudden emergency will bring them into operation. Bennett’stremendous effort not to drop out of the Gurdjieff exercises somehow pushed himinto a heightened state of ‘second wind’, and brought a completely new level ofcontrol over his ‘computer’. It is a pity that he did not try the experiment ofrecalling some event from his past; I suspect that he would have been able to‘replay’ it in the most accurate detail.In fact, as Dr Wilder Penfield discovered, our brains contain the stored ‘memorytapes’ of everything we have ever seen or felt, and these tapes can be‘replayed’ by stimulating the temporal cortex of the brain with an electricprobe. If we could achieve Bennett’s state of ‘second wind’, the electric probewould be unnecessary; all the memory tapes of the brain would become instantlyaccessible to us . . .But that, you will object, is still not time travel; it is merely playing back arecording. True. But, if Joseph Rodes Buchanan and William Denton were correctabout ‘psychometry’, then the brain also has the power to play back the historyof any object it chooses to scan—for example, a five billion-year-old meteorite.Buchanan’s ‘sensitives’ could hold a sealed letter and describe not only itscontents but also the state of mind of the person who had written it. And this,you may point out, is still not time travel. True. But it is something very likeit. And I would remind you that we have already agreed that time travel, inWells’s sense, is an absurdity. You cannot literally go back ‘before’ the Battleof Hastings, because the Battle of Hastings has already happened, and it cannotbe unhappened. Yet, if Buchanan and Denton are correct, then it should bepossible for a ‘sensitive’ to literally relive a day in the life of a soldierwho fought at the battle of Hastings. And Dunne’s experiment with time seems tosuggest that it might be possible to do the same for the future, and ‘relive’ aday that has not yet taken place. And this, I think, would qualify as timetravel.What I am now suggesting is a view of the human mind that has been forcingitself upon me for many years. My starting-point, in books like The Outsider andReligion and the Rebel, was the experiences of certain poets and mystics. Theromantic poets of the 19th century seemed to differ from their predecessors inone important respect: they seemed to have an altogether greater capacity forsustaining imaginative intensity. We live our lives confined by space and timeand the trivial necessities of everyday life; consciousness is basically adevice for perceiving what goes on around us. Poets and mystics seem to be ableto use it for a quite different purpose—to build up a kind of internal worldwhose intensity rivals that of the physical reality that surrounds us. When Icame—almost by accident—to turn my attention to the realm of the ‘occult’ orparanormal, it struck me that the ‘psychic’ is only another type of poet: aperson for whom the physical world is only one aspect of reality.Now this view seems to me, on reflection, logical and reasonable enough.Consciousness is tied to the physical world for a simple reason: if it weren’t,we would have been extinct long ago. As H.G. Wells pointed out, all animals are‘up against it’ from the moment they are born. In the Victorian age, childrenbegan work at six in the morning and finished at eight in the evening. Life isstill brutal and hard for well over a half of the human race. I am lucky that Ican sit at my desk, in a comfortable room, and address my mind to thisinteresting problem of the nature of time; you are lucky that you can sit downand read it. If you and I had to work a fourteen-hour day in a factory we wouldlong for a little leisure to relax and allow the mind to wing its way throughthe worlds of imagination.Because of this harsh physical necessity, consciousness has accustomed itself tosticking to the material world: which means, in effect, that it has never had achance to explore its own capacities—or rather, the capacities of thatextraordinary computer called the brain. But here we come to one of thestrangest parts of the story. For some odd reason, the capacity of this computeris far greater than it needs to be—at least, in terms of Darwinian evolution.For example, it is quite clear that we never make use of that vast library of‘memory tapes’ that Wilder Penfield discovered; we don’t need to make use ofthem for everyday survival. Then why are they there? Why has evolution dictatedthat the brain should remember every tiny event and idea of our lives? Again, Ihave always been fascinated by the capacity of calculating prodigies—usuallyyoung children of ordinary intelligence—who can multiply or divide immense sumsin their heads. Equally extraordinary is the class known as ‘idiotsavants’—children whose IQ may be on the moron level, yet who, in one particularfield, have some incredible mental gift—one, for example, could reel off thename of every musical film ever made and every actor who played every part.Moreover, some of these idiot savants have highly developed ‘psychic’ powers;for example, one boy declined a lift home with his teacher because, he said, hismother would be meeting him out of school. In fact, his mother did arrive tomeet him; but she had decided to do so only half an hour before, when anothertrip took her close to the school . . .And this example brings me to the starting-point of my book The Occult: theobservation that ‘psychic powers’ often seem to involve a breakdown—or at least,loss of efficiency—in our normal mental powers. For example, a Dutch housepainter named Peter van der Hurk fell off his ladder and fractured his skull;when he woke up in hospital, he discovered that he ‘knew’ all kinds of thingsabout his fellow patients, about their past and even their future. This strangecapacity has remained with him and, under the name of Peter Hurkos, he has madea considerable reputation as a ‘clairvoyant’ and psychometrist, often helpingthe police to solve murder cases. But, in the days immediately following hisaccident, he found life difficult because his new psychic powers made itimpossible for him to concentrate on ordinary, everyday jobs; he might havestarved if someone had not suggested using his powers to make a living as astage ‘magician’. When I read this story in Hurkos’ autobiography I found myselfthinking of all those romantic poets and artists who had died in poverty becausethey found it impossible to concentrate on the dreary necessities of materialexistence. There is obviously a close analogy.All this seems to suggest that our brains possess extraordinary powers that mostof us never have reason to use. The problem of survival demands that we are tieddown to the everyday world; if this were not so, we might all be calculatingprodigies and psychics, and probably literary and artistic geniuses into thebargain.But to phrase it this way suggests that it is a question of either/or: either weget rid of such unusual faculties or we lose our ability to survive. But is thechoice really as harsh as that? I am inclined to doubt it. Life for most of usis safer and more secure than at any other time in history. Modern man is farless likely to be knocked down by a car than his ancestors were to be eaten bywild beasts or killed by their fellow men. (Even as recently as the age of DrJohnson, remote country houses were often besieged by gangs of ruffians whokilled those who resisted and carried off everything of value.) Most of us havehours of leisure every week in which we might explore the possibilities of humanconsciousness. No, the real problem is a force of habit so deeply ingrained thatit would be better to refer to it as hypnosis. If you force a chicken’s beakagainst the floor, then draw a chalk line straight in front of it, the chickenwill be unable to raise its head when you let it go; for some odd reason itfocuses attention on the chalk line, and becomes hypnotized by it. We all sufferfrom a similar tendency; the moment we relax, habit induces a state similar tohypnosis, in which the attention becomes fixed on the external world. Sartrewrote about the café proprietor in Nausea: ‘When his café empties, his headempties too.’ But it is not confined to the illiterate or unintelligent. Thereis a story told of the famous mathematician Hilbert. Before a dinner party, hiswife sent him upstairs to change his tie; when, after an hour, he had still notreappeared, she went to see what had happened; he was in bed fast asleep. Heexplained that as soon as he had removed his tie, he had automatically taken offthe rest of his clothes, put on his pyjamas and climbed into bed.This is the problem of human consciousness: habits that bundle us into bed andoff to sleep when there are far more interesting things to be done. Chestertonasked why the world is so full of bright children and dud grown-ups. The reasonis that our most interesting potentialities fail to survive adolescence; we slipinto a habit of using only a fraction of our powers.When habit is broken, anything can happen. In a book called Mysteries (1978) Ihave cited the case of a lady named Jane O’Neill who, when driving to Londonairport, witnessed a serious accident and helped to free badly injured peoplefrom a wrecked coach. The shock was so severe that she had to take several weeksoff from work. She began to experience strange waking visions, some of whichwere oddly accurate: for example, she ‘saw’ a close friend chained in thegalleys; told about this, her friend replied that her ancestors were Huguenotsand many had found themselves in the galleys. One day in Fotheringhay Church,Jane O’Neill was impressed by a picture behind the altar. She later mentionedthis to the friend who had accompanied her, and her friend said that she had notseen any picture. Miss O’Neill was so puzzled that she rang the lady who cleanedthe church and asked her about it; the lady replied that there was no suchpicture. Later, the two women revisited the church; to Jane O’Neill’s surprise,the inside was quite different from what she had seen before—it was muchsmaller—and the picture was not there. She asked an expert on East Anglianchurches, who put her in touch with a historian who knew the history ofFotheringhay. He was able to tell her that the church she had ‘seen’ had beenthe church as it was more than four centuries ago; it had been rebuilt in 1553 .. .Jane O’Neill’s experience is, in its way, as well authenticated as that of MissMoberly and Miss Jourdain. In one sense, it is more convincing; I heard of it byaccident, through a friend, and wrote to Miss O’Neill, who was kind enough tosend me a full account, together with the exchange of letters with the historianwhich established that she had ‘seen’ the earlier church. Miss O’Neill had madeno attempt to publish her interesting story, so cannot be accused ofattention-seeking.But how can we reconcile a story as extraordinary as this with our everydayexperience of the real world? Most scientists have a short and convenient methodof dealing with such anomalies; they dismiss them as lies, distortions ormistakes. Whether intellectually justified or not (on grounds of ‘the laws ofprobability’), this is bound to strike anyone interested in such matters as puremental laziness. If an answer is to be found, I believe that its starting-pointmust be the notion that the powers of the human mind are far less limited thanwe naturally assume. This was a conclusion I had reached many years before Ibecame interested in the paranormal; so that, for example, in Religion and theRebel (1957), I had suggested that our everyday consciousness is as limited asthe middle few notes of a piano keyboard, and that its possible range is as wideas the whole keyboard. In states of great happiness or relief, or when involvedin some absorbing adventure, we receive a clear intuition that the world is aninfinitely richer and more complex place than ordinary consciousness permits usto perceive. And, moreover, that the mind is perfectly capable of taking a widergrip on that breadth and complexity . . .Hurkos’s accident, like Jane O’Neill’s, shook his mind out of its usual narrowrut, and made him aware that ‘everyday consciousness’ is basically unreliable inits report about the actuality that surrounds us. But then, is not suchnarrowness preferable to the state of confused inefficiency that accompanied hispowers of ‘second sight’? Was Jane O’Neill’s glimpse of Fotheringhay in the 16thcentury (or earlier) worth the mental shock of the coach accident? Thesequestions raise serious doubts about the desirability of such powers. But then,we are assuming that it is possible to investigate the unknown powers of themind only by destroying our everyday sense of reality. And this, fortunately, isuntrue.We may recall the story told by Alan Vaughan in his book Patterns of Prophecy,cited in Chapter 11 [../Text/16_chapter11.html] (p. 350[../Text/16_chapter11.html#page_350]), in which he became ‘possessed’ by thewife of a Nantucket sea captain, and how he was ‘exorcised’ by an occultist, whocaused an entity called ‘Z’ to drive out the sea captain’s wife through the topof Vaughan’s head:‘I began to feel an energy rising up within my body and entering my brain. Itpushed out both “Nada” and “Z”. My friends noted that my face, which had beenwhite and pinched, suddenly flooded with colour. I felt a tremendous sense ofelation and physical wellbeing. The energy grew stronger and seemed to extendbeyond my body. My mind seemed to race in some extended dimension that knew noconfines of time or space. For the first time, I began to sense what was goingon in other people’s minds and—to my astonishment—I began to sense the futurethrough some kind of extended awareness. My first act in this strange butexciting state was to throw the Ouija down an incinerator chute . . .’It was this experience that led Vaughan to study the whole question of propheticglimpses of the future. He had seen this ‘extended dimension that knew noconfines of time or space’, and decided that it deserved to be investigated. Thepoet Robert Graves described a similar experience in a story called ‘TheAbominable Mr Gunn’ (which, he told me, was autobiographical): ‘One fine summerevening as I sat alone on the roller behind the cricket pavilion, with nothingin my head, I received a celestial illumination: it occurred to me that I kneweverything. I remember letting my mind range rapidly over all its familiarsubjects of knowledge; only to find that this was no foolish fancy. I did knoweverything. To be plain: though conscious of having come less than a third ofthe way along the path of formal education . . . I nevertheless held the key oftruth in my hand, and could use it to open any lock of any door. Mine was noreligious or philosophical theory, but a simple method of looking sideways atdisorderly facts so as to make perfect sense of them.’The ‘secret’, Graves says, was still there when he woke up the next morning;but, when he tried writing it down, it vanished.It is true that Graves fails to explain just what he meant by the ‘secret’,except to say that it was ‘a sudden infantile awareness of the power ofintuition, the supra-logic that cuts out all routine processes of thought andleaps straight from problem to answer’. But he offers a further clue in citingthe case of another boy in the school who was able to solve a highly complicatedarithmetical problem merely by looking at it. The form master—‘Mr Gunn’—accusedthe boy of looking at the answer at the end of the book; the boy replied that hehad checked with the answer—later—and that its last two figures were wrong—theyshould be 35, not 53. The unsympathetic and obtuse Mr Gunn sent the boy to theheadmaster for a caning, declining to believe that he could simply have ‘seen’the answer . . .So it seems that Graves is speaking of a power related to that of mathematicalprodigies, the ability of the mind to see the answer to a problem in a singleflash. And how, precisely, does such an ability work? Is it some form oflightning calculation, that is, a process of ordinary reason in which everythingis speeded up, as in the famous Trachtenberg speed system of mathematics?Apparently not. We know this from the case of Zerah Colburn, the Canadiancalculating prodigy, who was asked whether a certain immense number was a prime(i.e. could not be divided by any other number), and who replied instantly: No,it can be divided by 641. Now there is no mathematical method of determiningwhether a certain number is a prime—except the painful method of trial anderror, dividing it by every smaller number and deciding that none of them works(shortcuts exist: if it can’t be divided by 3 it can’t be divided by 6, 9, 12,15 . . .). Obviously, Colburn ‘saw’ the answer, as Graves’s fellow pupil F.F.Smilley did—from ‘above’, as it were: a kind of bird’s eye view. And Graves’‘secret’ was, presumably, some similar method of grasping the answer to anyproblem by instantaneous intuition . . .We have seen in Chapter 2 [../Text/07_chapter02.html] that man is a doublebeing, with two selves who live one in each half of the brain. The being youcall ‘you’—your ego—resides in the left cerebral hemisphere. A few inches away,in the right hemisphere, there is another ‘you’; but it is dumb.When I work out a sum on paper, I am using my left hemisphere—with a certainamount of occasional assistance from the right, by way of sudden insights. Andthis, on the whole, seems to be the way the human brain works: the left is the‘front man’, the ego that deals with the world; and the right has to expressitself via the left. And, on the whole, the right has a fairly hard time of it;for the left is always in a hurry, always working out problems, and it tends totreat the right with impatience. This is why civilized Man seems to possess solittle intuition.It seems probable that calculating prodigies have not yet fallen victim to thisbullying dominance of the left. The ‘shades of the prison house’ have not yetbegun to close. They see the answer to a problem, and pass it oninstantaneously, unimpeded by the usual red tape of the bureaucrat who lives inthe left brain.For this, I must stress, is the real problem of civilized Man. We have evolvedto our present level through the use of language and concepts. We use these soconstantly that we ‘identify’ with the left half of the brain. This does no realharm, for in a sense the ‘personality’ is the linguistic part of us. The troublearises from the attitude of the ego to the non-ego who lives in the rightcerebral hemisphere. We tend to treat it as an idiot, as a kind of inarticulateand not-very-bright younger brother who is always being ignored and told to shutup. If we took the trouble to listen to it, we might learn a great deal.Occasionally, it may become so alarmed at our carefully calculated stupiditiesthat it takes the law into its own hands and interferes. Here I can cite apersonal example. The hill that leads up from Pentewan to Mevagissey is long,and has several abrupt curves. One day, I was driving up this hill with the sunin my eyes, almost completely blinded. At a certain point I reasoned that I mustbe approaching a bend, and tried to turn the steering-wheel. My hands ignoredme: they kept the wheel steady. My right brain knew I had not yet reached thebend, and simply cancelled my order to turn the steering-wheel.Even this last sentence illustrates our basic mistake. I say ‘my hands’, ‘myright brain’, as if they were both my property, like my clothes. But the beingwho calls himself ‘I’ is a usurper. It is his brother, who lives next door, whois the rightful heir to the throne. I say this because the left, for all itsnaive egoism, cannot live without the intuitions and insights of the right—thereare many creatures in the world who live perfectly well without language orideas. But the ideal state is one of close co-operation between the two halves,with the left treating the right as a wise counsellor and trusted adviser, notas the village idiot.Significantly, the left brain has a strong sense of time; the right hasabsolutely none. It strolls along at its own pace, with its hands in itspockets. This does not mean that the right lacks the ability to calculatetime—on the contrary, when you tell yourself that you must wake up at sixo’clock precisely and you open your eyes on the stroke of six, this is the workof the right. But it declines to take time too seriously. And it is right tofeel sceptical. The left is stupidly obsessed by time. An anecdote told byWilliam Seabrook of Aleister Crowley illustrates the point. When Crowley was onthe island of Sicily, a film star named Jane Wolfe came to pay him a visit; shewas in a state of permanent nervous tension. Crowley told her that she mustbegin her cure with a month of meditation on the cliff top. The idea dismayedher, but she agreed. She lived in a lean-to shelter and a boy brought up water,bread and grapes every day at dusk. For the first few days she was bored andirritable. By the 19th day she felt nothing but boredom. Then, quite suddenly,she passed into a state of deep calm and peace, with no desire to move. What hadhappened was simply that her over-dominant left brain—accustomed to theHollywood rat race—had gradually realised that it could stop running; then theright took over, with its sense of timelessness and serenity. What is beingsuggested is that time is an invention of the left brain. Time, as such, doesnot exist in nature. Nature knows only what Whitehead calls ‘process’—thingshappening. What human beings call time is a psychological concept; moreover, itis a left-brain concept.Now the left brain, as we know, sees things in rigid categories, and nature doesnot operate within such categories. Consider Zeno’s paradox of the arrow. At anymoment it is either where it is or where it isn’t. It can’t be where it isn’t;but if it is where it is, then it can’t be moving. The paradox of Achilles andthe tortoise depends on the same kind of logic. But the arrow does move;Achilles does overtake the tortoise, although it is ‘logically’ impossible.According to the left brain, there is no logical way of deciding whether a largenumber is a prime except by trial and error, but Zerah Colburn’s right brainsolved it instantly; and, in the same way, Peter Fairley’s right brain knew inadvance which horses would win at the races. (Significantly, Fairley hadsuffered temporary blindness just before he developed this ability; it seemsprobably that the shock was responsible for ‘short-circuiting’ the usualleft-brain processes.)This chapter is, of course, written in language, and it makes use of concepts;consequently its aim is, to some extent, self-defeating. How can I convey inwords the notion that time itself is merely a concept? The above examples can atleast take us in the right direction. For most people have known what it is tosuddenly ‘know’ the answer to a problem without thinking it out. Everyone hashad the experience of trying hard to remember something, and then having itstroll into his brain when he was no longer trying—almost as if another personhad knocked on the door of the left brain and said: ‘Is this what you werelooking for?’Which brings me to the most important step in this argument: that everyone hasexperienced the most basic ‘right-brain’insight, the curious ability that in TheOccult I labelled ‘Faculty X’. This is simply that odd ability to suddenly graspthe reality of some other time or other place. I have elsewhere cited theexample of the experience that led Arnold Toynbee to begin his Study of History.Toynbee was sitting at the summit of the citadel of Mistrà, in Sparta, lookingat the ruins that had been left by the wild highlanders who had overwhelmed itin 1821, when he was suddenly struck by the reality of what had happened—as ifthe highlanders were, at that very minute, pouring over the horizon andoverwhelming the city. He goes on to describe half a dozen more occasions whenthe ‘historical imagination’ has suddenly ‘brought the past to life’ and made itreal, and ends by describing a semi-mystical experience that occurred as he waspassing Victoria Station, London, during World War I, when he found himself ‘incommunion, not just with this or that episode in History, but with all that hadbeen, and was, and was to come’.Chesterton once said: ‘We say thank you when someone passes us the salt, but wedon’t mean it. We say the Earth is round, but we don’t mean it, even though it’strue.’ We mean something only when we feel it intensely, here and now. And thisis what happens in flashes of Faculty X: the mind suddenly conjures up thereality of some other time and place, as Proust’s hero suddenly became aware ofthe reality of his childhood as he tasted the cake dipped in herb tea.Faculty X is another name for insight, the sudden flash of understanding, ofdirect knowledge. And it enables us to see precisely how the left and rightco-operate. At school, I may learn some mathematical formula, like those fordoing long division or extracting square roots; but I use it mechanically. Ifone day I forget the formula, and have to work it out for myself, I achieveinsight into the reasons that lie behind it. But I can quite easily forget thisinsight, and go back to a mechanical use of the formula. The left brain dealswith surfaces, with forms; the right brain deals with insights, with what liesbeneath the surface. The left brain is a labour-saving device, an energy-savingdevice—exactly like using some simple mnemonic to remember the colours of thespectrum or the black notes on the piano. It is when you are full ofenergy—perhaps on a spring morning—that the right brain produces that oddglowing sense of reality. When you are very tired, the left brain takes over.Constant mental fatigue can produce the state Sartre calls ‘nausea’, in whichthe left brain scans the world but lacks all insight into its meaning—the righthas gone off duty: reality seems crude and meaningless.But here is the most difficult part of the argument to grasp. It is the rightbrain which presents us with ‘reality’. The left presents us only withimmediacy, what happens to be here and now. The left ‘scans’ the world; theright adds meaning and value. And your eyes, which are now scanning these words,are actually telling you lies. For they are presenting an essentially unrealworld to you as the only reality. ‘This is real,’ I say, knocking on the tablewith my knuckles; but my knuckles are only scanners, like my eyes.If, as you read these lines, you can penetrate to the meaning I am trying toconvey, you will do it by a mental leap, from left to right. And if you can makethat leap, you will also be able to grasp how Peter Fairley could know thewinners of a race that had not yet taken place, or how Zerah Colburn could‘know’ that 4,294,967,297 is divisible by 641. Somehow, the right ‘thinks’vertically, by taking a kind of upward leap and simply looking down on theanswer. You will object that this still doesn’t explain how it could ‘look downon’ the future, but this is because you are still thinking in left-brain terms.How would you, in fact, go about predicting some future event, assuming thatsomeone made it worth your while to do so? You would ploddingly try to assemblethousands of present ‘trends’, and try to work them out according to the law ofprobabilities. And because there are so many billions of possibilities, we saythe future is unpredictable. The right brain appears to know better . . .Let me try to summarize the argument so far. We have begun by dismissing ‘time’in the Wellsian sense, the kind of time in which you could travel with the aidof a time machine. Like ‘zyme’, this time is a logical error. What reallyhappens out there is ‘process’, and it would be absurd to speak of travelling inprocess. Time is actually a clock ticking inside the head—and, what is more, inonly one side of the head. Our senses, which are built to ‘scan’ the world, chopup process into seconds and minutes. They force us to see the world in theserigid terms of spatial and temporal location. Kant was quite right when he saidthat we see the world through ‘categories’. Think of the Kantian categories as aweird pair of prismatic spectacles you wear on your nose, spectacles which turneverything you see into the strangest angles and corners. This is space andtime, as our brains grasp it.All this, of course, fails to answer a basic question: how future time—that is,process which has not yet taken place—can be predictable. The only scientificexplanation is the one we have considered, the statistical assessment of‘trends’. But it seems fairly clear that Peter Fairley was unable to spotwinners by this method, for he knew nothing about racing, let alone about thecomplex possibilities presented by all the horses in the race. Anyway,experiment has shown that this cannot be the explanation. The well-knownpsychical investigator S. G. Soal performed a series of experiments in telepathywith a man named Basil Shackleton, and both were disappointed that the resultsseemed to be negative. Then a careful look at the results revealed aninteresting thing: Shackleton was guessing the next ESP card that would bechosen. This was confirmed by substituting cards with animal pictures—zebras,giraffes, and so on. Now there could be no possible doubt. If Soal uncovered acard of a zebra, and Shackleton (sitting in the next room) named it as agiraffe, it was almost certain that the next card Soal turned over would be agiraffe. Other experimenters—like J. B. Rhine and Charles Tart—have producedsimilar results.So it looks as if we are faced with a basic fact: that, whether it is impossibleor not, precognition actually takes place—precise and detailed precognition ofthe future—which suggests clearly that the ‘Kantian’ theory is basicallycorrect: there is something wrong with what our senses—and left brain—tell usabout the world.I could easily spend the remainder of this chapter raising questions aboutprecisely how our senses could be mistaken. Such an approach would beinteresting; but I doubt whether it would be very conclusive. Besides, much ofmy time would be taken up in summarising Edmund Husserl’s book The Phenomenologyof Internal Time Consciousness; and those who are interested would do better toread it for themselves. Instead, let us, for the sake of argument, assume thatthis part of the case is proved—that there is something wrong with ourleft-brain conception of time—and look more closely into the other half of theequation: the curious power that, under certain circumstances, seems to enableus to foresee the future.In a fascinating and lucid book, The Case Against Jones, John Vyvyan cites twointeresting cases, one of precognition, one of retrocognition.The first concerns a priest named Canon Guarnier, who dreamed with exceptionalclarity of an Italian landscape—a mountain road, a white house, a woman knittingwith her daughter looking on, three men dressed in aprons and pointed hatssitting at a table, a sleeping dog, three sheep in a field . . . The scene wasdetailed and vivid. Three years later, on his way to Rome, Guarnier’s carriagestopped to change horses, and he found himself looking at the identical scene,accurate in every detail. ‘Nothing is changed; the people are exactly those Isaw, as I saw them, doing the same things in the same attitudes, with the samegestures . . .’The other case concerns the novelist George Gissing, who fell into a fever atCrotone in southern Italy. After a nightmare, he fell into a ‘visionary state’,in which he saw a series of pictures of Roman history. These are described inconsiderable detail—too long to quote here. But Gissing himself had no doubtthat he had somehow witnessed real scenes of history, not simply imaginativepictures. ‘If the picture corresponded to nothing real, tell me who can, by whatpower I reconstructed, to the last perfection of intimacy, a world known to meonly in ruined fragments.’This, of course, is no proof that it was not imagination. What strikes me inreading Gissing’s account—for example, of seeing Hannibal’s slaughter of twothousand mercenaries on the seashore by Crotone—is its similarity to Toynbee’s‘visions’ of the past. Wells’s account of Gissing’s death—in the Experiment inAutobiography—makes it clear that Gissing saw these visions again on hisdeathbed. Like John Vyvyan, I am certainly inclined to disbelieve that it wasmere hallucination. His insistence on the clarity of the scene recallsGuarnier’s dream, and the experiences of Jane O’Neill and of Misses Moberly andJourdain.I formulated the theory of Faculty X in my book The Occult (1971). But fouryears before this, I had made use of the concept in fiction, in a novel calledThe Philosopher’s Stone, which is centrally concerned with this notion of‘mental time travel’. In this novel I suggested that the pre-frontal lobes ofthe brain (I didn’t then know about the rôles of the right and left brains) aresomehow connected with ‘poetic’ experience: Wordsworth’s feeling as a child thatmeadow, grove and stream were ‘apparelled in celestial light’. No one seemscertain of the precise purpose of the pre-frontal lobes, but we know that, whenan adult’s pre-frontal lobes are damaged, it seems to make little difference tohis functioning, except that he becomes coarser. In children, on the other hand,pre-frontal damage causes an obvious drop in intelligence: that is, children usethe pre-frontal lobes. Could this explain why children experience the ‘glory andthe freshness of a dream’, while adults live in an altogether drearierworld—that adults have ceased to use this ‘visionary’ function of the prefrontallobes?In The Philosopher’s Stone I posit a brain operation that is able to restore the‘glory and the freshness’ to the pre-frontal lobes. Whoever has this operationexperiences a kind of revelation. The world becomes alive and exciting andinfinitely fascinating, a place of constant ‘magic’.The underlying assumption here is that the rational intellect—the left brain—isto blame for the dullness of everyday consciousness, with its accompanying senseof triviality and futility. The dullness and rationality are necessary if we areto deal with the complexities of adult life; but we somehow forget the realitythat lies behind our systems of abstraction. And since our vitality is fed bythe sense of reality—and purpose—this forgetfulness causes a gradualwithering-away of some essential faculty, just as blindness would cause agradual forgetfulness of the reality of colour. The pre-frontal operationremedies this forgetfulness, generating a sudden enormous sense of the purposeof human existence.One of the central scenes of the novel occurs when the hero is seated in aStratford garden, basking in the peace and serenity, and enjoying the sense oftimelessness that Jane Wolfe experienced after a month of meditation in Sicily.He finds himself wondering idly what this garden would have looked like in theage of Shakespeare—then suddenly realises that he knows the answer; that hepossesses a faculty that can tell him exactly what he wants to know. In writingthis scene, it struck me as quite obvious that if one could retreat into a deepenough state of serenity, all such questions would become answerable. Yet I wasfully aware that ‘insight’ can deal only with questions of a logical nature, notwith those involving particularities or facts (e.g., no amount of insight couldnormally tell me the name of Cleopatra’s great-grandmother: I have to turn tothe history books).When I thought about this question, it seemed to me that the answer lay insomething we know intuitively about states of deep serenity. And this‘something’ is probably the notion I have already discussed in connection withBuchanan and psychometry: the feeling that the world contains an infinitude ofinformation, and that we possess, although we seldom use, the senses to make useof it. If psychometry works—and there is an impressive body of experimentalevidence that it does—it must be because objects somehow record everything thathas ever happened to them. But we have already noted that our brains also recordeverything that has ever happened to us. At this point we should observe that,no matter how much information we have access to, we can make use of it only bycross-checking it with information inside us (e.g. faced with a broken-down car,a man who knew nothing about cars would be helpless, even if he had a massivehandbook on cars; before he can make use of it, he needs to have certain basicinformation about cars inside his brain). But with an infinitude of informationoutside us, and something like an infinitude inside us, we possess the basicnecessities for answering almost any question.I am still by no means certain that this ‘paradigm’ is the answer. How, forexample, can it explain something that happened to a musician friend of mine,Mark Bredin, as he was travelling back late one night by taxi along theBayswater Road? Suddenly, he felt certain that, at the next trafficlight—Queensway—a taxi would jump the lights and hit them, side-on. But itseemed absurd to tap the driver on the shoulder and say ‘Excuse me, but . . .’So he said nothing. At the next traffic light, a taxi ignored a red light, andhit them sideways-on . . . Could it have been some kind of extrasensoryperception that told him of the approach of the taxi along Queensway at acertain speed, and that the impatient driver would arrive just as the light wasturning red?All that does seem clear is that Bredin was tired and very relaxed but that,after a concert, his senses were still alert. The great roaring machine ofeveryday awareness, with all its irrelevant information, had been switched offand he could become aware of normally-unperceived items of knowledge.It was after writing The Occult, and while I was working on my book Mysteries,that I became aware that the problem was probably complicated by another factor.My discovery that I could use a dowsing-rod, and that it reacted powerfully inthe area of ancient standing stones, made me clearly aware of this ‘other’ me,the non-ego, who lives in the right hemisphere. I also became increasinglyinterested in the work of that remarkable man, the late Tom Lethbridge, aretired Cambridge don who studied the use of the pendulum in dowsing for variousmaterials. After exhaustive experiments, Lethbridge concluded that the pendulumresponds, at various lengths, to every known substance in our world i.e. that inthe hands of a good dowser a fourteen-inch pendulum will go into stronggyrations over sand, while a twenty-five-inch pendulum will detect aluminium.But, having established this to his own satisfaction, Lethbridge was astonishedto discover that the pendulum would respond equally definitely to feelings andideas i.e. that a ten-inch pendulum would respond to the thought of light oryouth, while a twenty-nine-inch pendulum would respond to danger or yellow. Thisseemed to connect with another baffling phenomenon, which I myself havewitnessed: map dowsing. It sounds preposterous, but some dowsers are able tolocate whatever they are looking for over a map as well as over the actual areaof ground. ‘Professor’ Joad, a confirmed sceptic, described in a Brains Trustprogramme how he had seen a map dowser accurately trace all the streams on a mapfrom which they had been removed. I have seen a map dowser, Bill Lewis,accurately trace the course of an underground waterpipe on a sketch map drawn bymy wife.And at this point I became fascinated by another equally strange phenomenon,that of ‘multiple personality’. There are dozens of recorded cases of patientswho slip in and out of a series of totally different personalities. One of themost widely publicised was described in the book The Three Faces of Eve. InMysteries I have described in detail the equally strange cases of ChristineBeauchamp and Doris Fischer. In her book Sybil Flora Schreiber has described thecase of a girl who had 16 different personalities. Such cases actually look likeold-fashioned accounts of ‘demonic possession’. The resident personality, so tospeak, is suddenly expelled from the body, and a stranger takes over. When the‘resident personality’ comes back, he (or she) has no memory of what has takenplace in the meantime.What interested me about such cases is that the various personalities seem tohave a definite pecking order or hierarchy, with the most powerful at the top,the next most powerful next to the top, and so on. (The ‘resident personality’is usually about halfway down the ladder.) Moreover, the ‘top’ personality knowsall about all those underneath; the next one down knows about all thoseunderneath, but not about the one above. And so it goes on, with the bottom-mostpersonality knowing only about himself/herself.I made another interesting observation. In many cases, the ‘top’ personality isa more mature and balanced individual than the patient has ever had theopportunity to become. For example, Jung’s cousin, who was such a case, was ateenager; yet her ‘top’ personality was a mature woman at least ten years older.In 1973, my own experience of ‘panic attacks’, brought on by overwork andstress, suggested a further insight: that we are basically all multiplepersonalities, although, in well-balanced human beings, the others neveractually unseat the resident personality. In my panic attacks, I found that Icould gain a measure of control by calling upon what seemed to be a higher levelof my own being, a kind of ‘higher me’. This led me to wonder how many ‘higherme’s’ there are. And whether the solution of some of these mysteries ofparanormal powers—like precognition—may not lie in this higher level of‘myself’. In short, whether, as Aldous Huxley once suggested, the mind possessesa superconscious attic as well as a subconscious basement—a superconscious mindof which we are unaware, as we are unaware of the subconscious. My own pictureof the ‘ladder of selves’ seemed to suggest that the attic has several storeys.Lethbridge had begun to formulate a similar theory to explain the accuracy ofhis pendulum: that there is a part of the mind that knows the answer to thesequestions, but which can communicate only indirectly. This, of course, soundsmore like the right cerebral hemisphere than the ‘superconscious mind’. Butthen, the right cerebral hemisphere might well be the ‘seat’ of thesuperconscious mind, if such a thing exists.Of course, we are all aware that we develop into a series of different peopleover the course of a lifetime. But we say this is ‘only a manner of speaking’.Is it, though? Some people experience a total personality change when they getbehind the wheel of a car; they feel as if a more reckless and impatient ‘self’has taken over their body. A person involved in lovemaking for the first timemay find that he/she is ‘taken over’ by another self, with its own biologicalpurposes, and that he/she suddenly becomes oddly self-confident and purposeful.A mother holding her first baby is startled to feel a kind of archetypal motherinside herself taking over her responses and her mind . . .This leads me to speculate that we may all begin life as a whole series ofselves, encapsulated like those Japanese paper flowers, waiting for the rightmoment to unfold. Someone who never loses their virginity, a woman who neverbecomes a mother, never allows that particular self to enter the world of theliving. Yet a priest who becomes a saint may allow still higher ‘selves’ tounfold, while the rest of us remain trapped in a routine of getting andspending. A Queen Elizabeth or Florence Nightingale may develop areas of herbeing which remain unconscious in the satisfied housewife.All this seems to provide a possible explanation for Alan Vaughan’s experience,when ‘Z’ drove the Nantucket ‘spirit’ out of his head. He obviously felt animmense and boundless relief, an explosion of sheer delight. Could this havelifted him, as it were, to a higher rung on the ‘ladder of selves’? For onething is perfectly clear: the ‘lower’ we feel, the more we are subject to time.At the beginning of a railway journey, I may feel so concentrated and absorbedthat I can simply look out of the window, and experience all kinds ofinteresting insights and sensations. Later on, I feel less absorbed, but cannevertheless find pleasure in a book. If the journey is far too long, and thetrain breaks down, and I get cold and hungry, all my concentration vanishes, andtime now drags itself slowly, ‘like a wounded snake’. The less absorbed Ibecome, the slower time passes. It seems, therefore, reasonable to assume thatif I could reach some entirely new level of delight and concentration, timewould virtually disappear. In such a state, I might well know what was passingin other people’s minds, and know the future. At all events, it seems clear thatpsychological time is closely related to our control over our own inner states.It seems likely that someone who had achieved a perfect level of collaborationbetween the right and left hemispheres, instead of the present mutualmisunderstanding and confusion, would be able to slow time down or speed it upat will. Therefore, whatever we know or do not know about time, one thing seemscertain: that increased understanding of our own latent powers will bringincreased insight into the nature of time.It could also bring insight into the oddest of all mysteries connected withtime: the problem of synchronicity.The word was coined by the psychologist C. G. Jung to describe what he called‘meaningful coincidence’. As an example, he offers the amusing case of M.Fortgibu, as recounted by the French scientist Camille Flammarion, in his bookThe Unknown. This is Flammarion’s own account:‘Emile Deschamps, a distinguished poet, somewhat overlooked in these days, oneof the authors of the libretto of the ‘Huguenots’, tells of a curious series offortuitous coincidences as follows:‘In his childhood, being at a boarding-school at Orleans, he chanced to findhimself on a certain day at table with a M. de Fortgibu, an émigré recentlyreturned from England, who made him taste a plum-pudding, a dish almost unknownat that time in France.‘The remembrance of that feast had by degrees faded from his memory, when, tenyears later, passing by a restaurant on the Boulevard Poissonière, he perceivedinside it a plum-pudding of most excellent appearance.‘He went in and asked for a slice of it, but was informed that the whole hadbeen ordered by another customer. ‘M. de Fortgibu,’ cried the dame du comptoir,seeing that Deschamps looked disappointed, ‘would you have the goodness to shareyour plum-pudding with this gentleman?’‘Deschamps had some difficulty in recognizing M. de Fortgibu in an elderly man,with powdered hair, dressed in a colonel’s uniform, who was taking his dinner atone of the tables.‘The officer said it would give him pleasure to offer part of his pudding to thegentleman.‘Long years had passed since Deschamps had even thought of plum-pudding, or ofM. de Fortgibu.‘One day he was invited to a dinner where there was to be a real Englishplum-pudding. He accepted the invitation, but told the lady of the house, as ajoke, that he knew M. de Fortgibu would be of the party, and he caused muchamusement by giving the reason.‘The day came, and he went to the house. Ten guests occupied the ten places attable, and a magnificent plum-pudding was served. They were beginning to laughat Deschamps about his M. de Fortgibu, when the door opened and a servantannounced:‘“M. de Fortgibu.”‘An old man entered, walking feebly, with the help of a servant. He went slowlyround the table, as if looking for somebody, and he seemed greatly disconcerted.Was it a vision? or was it a joke?‘It was the time of the Carnival, and Deschamps was sure it was a trick. But asthe old man approached him he was forced to recognize M. de Fortgibu in person.‘“My hair stood up on my head,” he said. “Don Juan, in the chef d’œuvre ofMozart, was not more terrified by his guest of stone.”‘All was soon explained. M. de Fortgibu had been asked to dinner by a friend wholived in the same house, but had mistaken the door of his apartment.‘There is really in this story a series of coincidences which confounds us, andwe can understand the exclamation of the author when the remembrance of a thingso extraordinary occurred to him: “Three times in my life have I eatenplum-pudding, and three times have I seen M. de Fortgibu! A fourth time I shouldfeel capable of anything . . . or capable of nothing!”’This last comment recalls Richard Church’s feeling, described in Chapter 1[../Text/06_chapter01.html], when he realised that the blows of thewood-chopper’s axe were not synchronising with its sound: the sudden exultantfeeling that time is somehow a cheat, and that man is far more free than herealises – a recognition that allowed Church to float off the ground and fly.The word ‘synchronicity’ was coined by Jung in connection with the I Ching, theChinese Book of Changes, which the Chinese consult as an ‘oracle’. The method of‘consulting’ the I Ching consists of throwing down three coins at random half adozen times and noting whether there are more heads or tails. Two or three tailsgives a line with a break in the middle, as in the diagram below; three headsgives an unbroken line. The six lines, placed on top of one another, form a‘hexagram’:[../Images/pg468a.jpg]The above hexagram is number 58, ‘The Joyous—Lake’, with a ‘Judgement’: ‘TheJoyous, Success—Perseverance is favourable.’ But from the logical point of viewit is obviously impossible to explain how throwing down coins at random canprovide an answer—even if the question has been very clearly and preciselyformulated in the mind before the coins are thrown.If, against all reason, it actually works, then we must conclude that there issome ‘hidden mechanism’ that causes it to work. Such a mechanism could onlyinvolve a connection between the mind and the external world, so that the onecould influence the other. One obvious possibility is ‘extra-sensory perception’(ESP). Dame Rebecca West has described how she was in the London Library, tryingto check up on an episode in one of the Nuremberg war crimes trials, and how shediscovered, to her annoyance, that the trials were not arranged in alphabeticalorder. After an hour of fruitless searching, she addressed a librarian who wasapproaching her and started to complain, reaching out as she did so toillustrate her point by showing him a typical volume. The one she picked openedat the page she had been looking for.This certainly sounds like some form of ESP, some unconscious knowledge of wherethe passage was located. But what about the chance that caused the librarian tobe standing in front of the book at the right moment? We have here such acomplex situation that it is difficult to think of an answer in terms of some‘passive’ faculty like ESP.Another story concerning Rebecca West underlines this point. Again in the LondonLibrary, she was waiting for a copy of Gounod’s Memoirs to arrive. She wasapproached by an American who recognised her, and who asked if it was true thatshe possessed some lithographs by the artist Delpeche. They were still talkingabout Delpeche when the Memoirs arrived; she opened it casually, and foundherself looking at the name Delpeche—a passage in which Gounod described howDelpeche had been kind to his mother. The assistant was already on his way tocollect the Memoirs when the artist approached her, so again we have a complexsituation that cannot be explained in terms of ESP. We are forced to fall backon ‘coincidence’.But some synchronicities seem so preposterous that this explanation seemsincreasingly hollow. The best example I can give is a personal one. When writingan article about synchronicity (for An Encyclopedia of Unsolved Mysteries), Ibegan to experience a series of absurd synchronicities, the oddest of which wasas follows. I was describing an experience of the ‘Ufologist’ Jacques Vallee,who became interested in a Los Angeles religious cult known as the Order ofMelchizedec—Melchizedek being one of the obscurer Biblical prophets. (We havealready encountered him in connection with Dion Fortune.) Vallee had searchedfor information about the prophet, but without much success. In the midst ofthis search, he took a taxi to Los Angeles airport, and asked his lady taxidriver for a receipt. She gave him a receipt signed ‘M. Melchizedec’. He thoughtthis an amusing coincidence, which suggested that there were more Melchizedecsaround than he had assumed. But when he checked the Los Angeles telephonedirectory—a vast compilation in several volumes—he found only oneMelchizedec—his taxi driver.Vallee said it was as if he had stuck a notice on some universal notice board:‘Wanted—Melchizedecs’, and some earnest guardian angel had asked: ‘How aboutthis?’ ‘No, no, that’s no good—that’s a taxi driver . . .’Vallee points out that there are two ways in which a librarian can storeinformation. One is in alphabetical order. But a simpler system would be toplace each book on the nearest shelf as it arrived, and have somestraightforward method of retrieving it—like a ‘beeper’ on the spine of everybook, which would respond to a radio signal by making a noise to signal itsposition. Vallee is suggesting that this may be how the universe isconstructed—on a system known as a ‘random data base’—and that it could explainapparent ‘synchronicities’.After I had finished writing this passage, I broke off my day’s work to take mydogs for a walk. As I was leaving my work room, I noticed on the camp-bed a bookthat had obviously fallen off the shelf, and which I did not recognise. It wascalled You Are Sentenced to Life, by a Dr W. D. Chesney, and I had obviouslybought it many years before in California and sent it for binding. But I hadnever actually read it. When I came back from my walk, I glanced through thebook—and discovered, at the very end, a page headed ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEC. It wasa letter to the author from the founder of the Order, Grace Hooper Pettipher.I had cited Vallee’s story about Melchizedec as one of the most proposteroussynchronicities I know. Finding yet another reference to the Order within anhour or so of writing about it—I have about 30,000 books in my house—obviouslyinvolved a coincidence that would be beyond numerical calculation. It was as ifthe ‘guardian angel’ had said: ‘You think that’s preposterous?—well how aboutthis?’It was shortly after this that, reading some text about Hermes Trismegistus, thelegendary founder of magic, and his famous formula ‘As above, so below’ (whichis supposed to express the essence of magic), I felt for the first time that Iunderstood the inner meaning of the saying. It is generally taken to refer tothe magical system of ‘correspondences’, the idea that earthly things have aheavenly connection. (For example, the days of the weeks are named after gods,and a magician who wished to perform a ceremony to ensure wealth would chooseSunday as the best day, since the sun is associated with gold . . .) Whatsuddenly struck me is that we are all accustomed to the fact that theenvironment can act upon the mind—so that a dull day can make us depressed, andso on. But the fundamental tenet of ‘occultism’ (and the basic assertion of thisbook) is that the mind possesses hidden powers that can influence the externalworld. This seems to happen by a process of ‘induction’, not unlike thatinvolved in a simple electrical transformer. If, for example, I wish to use myBritish electric razor when I am in America, I have to buy a transformer whichwill ‘step-up’ American voltage (120) to British voltage (240.) If I want to usean American razor in England, I have to reverse the same transformer (whichmerely involves connecting it up back-to-front) to step-down 240 volts to 120.Like most people, I have often observed that when I am in an optimistic andpurposeful state, things tend to ‘go right’. When I am tired and depressed, theygo wrong—as if I have wired up my ‘mind transformer’ the wrong way round, so itcauses ‘lower’ vibrations in the external world. Optimism, on the other hand,seems to induce more powerful vibrations in the external world, and these inturn induce ‘serendipity’—a term coined by Horace Walpole, meaning ‘the facultyof making happy and unexpected discoveries by chance’.Religion has always taught that the gods have power over matter, but man is itsslave: if this interpretation is correct, ‘As above, so below’ means that manhas the same potential power to control matter as the gods.This is obviously the essence of Richard Church’s insight when the sound of thehatchet and its impact on the tree became ‘desynchronised’ (see page 9[../Text/06_chapter01.html#page_9]): ‘I had found that time and space are notabsolute. Their power was not law . . .’ This is obviously the beginning of atotally different attitude towards reality, an attitude that contradicts our‘normal’ basic assumptions.Let me attempt to express this more clearly. Life on earth has always had adifficult struggle to maintain itself. And man, one of the youngest of lifeforms, has had to fight against every kind of obstacle. What is so remarkable isthat, unlike his fellow animals, he has learned to use his mind as his mostimportant tool in the struggle for existence. This has carried him into anextraordinary realm of imagination and ideas. Our domestic animals live in thephysical world; but our children already inhabit a strange electronic world ofvideo-recorders and computers that would be beyond the grasp of any dog or cat.Man has become a creature of two worlds, with one foot on the solid earth andone foot in the world of the mind.But because he is one of the youngest of all earth’s creatures (only a fewviruses are younger), he is extremely unsure of himself. With very fewexceptions, each individual feels himself to be surrounded by a vast, hostileworld that makes him feel like a pygmy. Above all, this huge and complex worldmakes him feel passive, a ‘creature of circumstance’. Some primitive creaturefrom another planet might well assume man sees himself as a god, but he would bemistaken. We feel that we have very little influence over our complicated lives.Moreover, as soon as we feel tired or worried, we feel even more ‘trapped’, andour estimate of ourselves sinks almost to zero.This is absurd. If we can make the imaginative effort of placing ourselvesbehind the eyes of one of our cave-man ancestors of the late Pleistocene era, wecan imagine his amazement if he could catch a glimpse of the ziggurats of theSumerians, the pyramids of Egypt, the temples of Greece, the aqueducts of theRomans; and if he could see our modern skyscrapers and space probes, he wouldregard us as a race of supermen. And in a sense he would be right. It is we whofail to grasp the magnitude of our own achievement. We remain subject to acrippling kind of modesty, a neurosis of self-belittlement. Because of ourinability to achieve a certain detachment from our own lives—to see them as itwere, from a bird’s eye view rather than a worm’s eye view—we remain gloomilyself-critical, convinced that all our technical and intellectual achievementsare a kind of vanity or a prelude to catastrophe.Yet in the past century or so, we have, in fact, begun to develop a kind of‘bird’s eye view’, a certain capacity to soar above the trivia of our everydaylives into the realm of imagination and intellectual detachment. It is thiscapacity that promises that man will finally begin to grasp the magnitude of hisown achievement, and to live on a far higher level of zest and vitality.One thing seems clear: that the various ‘hidden powers’ we have spoken of in thecourse of this book are called into operation when we are in moods of optimismand relaxation. And, what is more, they induce a feeling of optimism andrelaxation, as we can see in the case of Richard Church; in other words, thereis a ‘feedback’ effect. All this suggests that there is a close connectionbetween optimism, the ‘bird’s eye view’, and the development of these ‘hiddenpowers’. It also suggests that the most important step in this direction is theability to grasp what is at issue in the puzzling phenomenon of synchronicity.Alan Vaughan’s vision of the future reminds us that there have always been menand women who possessed this curious ability; they are known as ‘prophets’. Oneof the chief problems about the great prophets of the past—Nostradamus,Paracelsus, Mother Shipton, the Brahan Seer—is that their prophecies are sofrequently ambiguous. The ‘magician’ Paracelsus published in 1530 (eleven yearsbefore his death) a number of obscure prophecies, including one of wars, riots,slaughters and conflagrations in the North countries, warning the inhabitants ofBrabant, Flanders and Zealand to beware. At the time Paracelsus wrote, the LowCountries were peaceful and prosperous; fourteen years after his death, theypassed from the Emperor Charles V to his son Philip of Spain, who attempted toimpose Catholicism with the aid of the Inquisition, bringing about one of themost appalling reigns of terror in history. As a prophecy, then, it isimpressive, but it could be no more than a fortunate guess—after all, in a worldfull of warlike princes, nothing is more likely than slaughters, riots andconflagrations.Michel Nostradamus, who died a quarter of a century after Paracelsus, is themost controversial of all ‘prophets’. In 1555, he published the first edition ofhis ‘quatrains’, four-line stanzas arranged in centuries (lots of 100—a dozen inall, although several are incomplete.) Most of these are incredibly obscure,and, since they are all mixed up together, it is difficult to guess what periodthey are supposed to apply to. What, for example, can one make of this:Milan, Ferrare, Turin et Aquilleye,Capne, Brundis, vexez par gent Celtique,Par le Lyon et phalange aquilee,Quand Rome aura le chef vieux Britannique.(5:99)Literally translated, this seems to mean: ‘Milan, Ferrara, Turin and Aquila,Capua, Brindisi vexed by a Celtic (i.e. French) gentleman, by the lion and eaglephalanx, when Rome has the old British chief.’It seems to be utter nonsense. But one of its interpreters, Stewart Robb, findshidden meaning there. The French army used the eagle as an emblem for the firsttime under Napoleon, so presumably he is the ‘French gent’ referred to. Napoleonalso taught his army to form into Macedonian ‘phalanxes’. Napoleon liked tothink of himself as ‘the lion’, and even thought of adopting it as his emblem.So it would seem that the stanza refers to Napoleon’s Italian campaigns(1796–7). But who is the ‘old British chief’ whom Rome will have? Well,apparently the Brother of Bonnie Prince Charlie was living in Rome at the time,and the Jacobites liked to refer to him as Henry IX of Great Britain, since hisbrother was now dead . . .An interesting interpretation which is by no means unconvincing. But is theBrother of Bonnie Prince Charlie really so important that he deserves a mentionin the same breath as Napoleon’s Italian campaigns? If Napoleon had met him, orif he had played some part in the campaign, it would be very convincing; as itis, we must feel that the case for Napoleon is unproven.Having said which, it must be admitted that there are some very convincingquatrains. There is one which runs:Du nuit viendra par le foret de ReinesDeux pars, valtorte, Herne la pierre blanche,Le moin noir en gris dedans Varenne,Eleu Cap. cause tempeste, feu, sang, tranche.By night will come through the forest of ReinesTwo partners, by a tortuous valley, Herne the white stone,The black monk in grey into Varenne:Elected capet, cause tempest, fire, blood and slicing.Varennes only appears once in French history, and this was when king Louis XVIfled there with Marie Antoinette from the French Revolution. They went via theforest of Reins, and lost their way, having chosen a bad route (’tortuousvalley’). The king wore a grey suit, and he was, in fact, an elected king(capet), the first France had had. And his flight and subsequent arrest atVarennes led to the Terror, which ended with them losing their heads (the word‘tranche’ almost sounds like the fall of the guillotine).This is an impressive number of ‘hits’. But we have still failed to explain‘Herne the white stone’, and the black monk. The king was of monkish temperamentand had been impotent, so it could refer to this; one commentator says thatHerne is an anagram of reine—queen, and that Marie Antoinette always dressed inwhite.Other ‘hits’ concern Henry of France, the French Revolution, and the massacre atNantes. But literally hundreds of other stanzas remain totally obscure, like thefollowing:Weak warships will be united togetherFalse enemies, the strongest one on the ramparts,The weak attacked, Bratislava trembles,Lübeck and Misnen will hold the barbarous part.The only word that leaps out of all this is Bratislava, the capital ofCzechoslovakia, and since two German place-names are also mentioned, a moderninterpretation will obviously start out from the assumption that this is aboutHitler’s annexation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, and possibly his invasion ofNorth Africa in 1941 (’the barbarous part’). The German navy was not strong in1939. Jean Charles de Fontbrune explains in his edition of Nostradamus that the‘false enemies’ are the Hungarians whose threat led Czechoslovakia to proclaimindependence; the ‘strongest one on the ramparts’ is presumably Hitler, but whathe is doing on the ramparts is not clear (Fontbrune suggests keeping watch).Czechoslovakia has no sea coast, so it is hard to see why Bratislava istrembling at the German navy, or why Lübeck, which is 15 kilometres inland fromthe Baltic, should be mentioned. (Misnen is on the North Sea.) Altogether, itrequires something of an act of faith to believe that Nostradamus was reallyprophesying the events of 1939 and 1941.This should bring comfort to those who recall Nostradamus’s most famousprophecy:L’an mille neuf cens nonante neuf sept moisDu ciel viendra un grand Roi deffrayeur.Rescusciter le grand Roi d’AngolmoisAvant que Mars regner par bonheur.This declares that in July 1999, the ‘great king of terror’ will come from thesky. The great king of the Mongols, Genghis Khan, will be resuscitated(Angolmois is supposed to be an anagram of Mongolais), before which Mars (war?)will reign happily. But the Millennium was regarded with superstitious terror inthe Middle Ages (and even today, the word is synonymous with breathtakingevents, either agreeable or appalling). Mother Shipton, another remarkableprophet who lived in Yorkshire at the time of Nostradamus declared confidentlythatThe world to an end shall comeIn eighteen hundred and eighty one.Mother Shipton also prophesied ‘carriages without horses’, thought that wouldfly around the world ‘in the twinkling of an eye’, iron ships that would floaton water, and men flying in the air—a remarkable record of success. She evenprophesied that Cardinal Wolsey would see York but fail to reach it, and wascorrect—he saw it from the top of a castle tower, but was then recalled toLondon, and died on the way. But it also seems clear that her powers of prophecylost their accuracy as they reached into the distant future.Another prophet who predicted horseless carriages—but this time drawn bychariots of fire (i.e railway engines)—was known as the Brahan Seer, and helived a century after Nostradamus. Coinneach Odhar (or Kenneth Mackenzie) wasborn in Uig, on the Island of Lewis (in the Hebrides) around 1600. News of hispowers of ‘second sight’ reached his feudal overlord, Kenneth CabarfeidhMackenzie—Lord Mackenzie of Kintail—who lived in Brahan Castle—and he releasedthe seer from his job as a farm labourer and allowed him to live rent-free in asod-roofed cottage. The seer attributed his powers to a ‘divining stone’ with ahole in it, through which he used to look to see the future. It was his powersof short-term prophecy that impressed Lord Mackenzie, as when he predicted thata Lochalsh woman would weep over the grave of a Frenchman in Lochalsh graveyard.It seemed unlikely, since there were few Frenchmen in Scotland; but, within afew months, Mackenzie heard of a Lochalsh woman who spent much of her timeweeping beside the grave of her French husband, a footman, who had died afterthe seer’s prediction. When an elderly man, Duncan Macrae, asked the seer how hewould end his days, there was general incredulity when Odhar said he would dieby the sword, since there had been peace for some time. In 1654, General Monckled Cromwellian troops to Kintail, and when he met Macrae, asked him somequestion which Macrae failed to understand. Macrae put his hand on his sword,and was promptly cut down.In 1630, the seer was passing over a patch of moorland when he predicted that itwould be ‘stained with the best blood of the Highlands: 116 years later, it wasthe site of the battle of Culloden. Perhaps his ‘longest shot’ was a prophecythat a woman called Annabella Mackenzie would live in the village of BaileMhuilinn, and that she would die of measles. This prophecy took more than twocenturies to be fulfilled; then an old lady of that name did die of measles inBaile Mhuilinn—at the age of 95.There are two stories about the end of the seer. One states that his lord’s wifeasked him what her husband was doing—Mackenzie was at that time in Paris—andOdhar was injudicious enough to tell her that he saw him kneeling at the feet ofa fair lady. The Countess then ordered him to be burned in a tar barrel. Themore likely story states that when the local gentry were gathered at BrahanCastle, the seer remarked (in Gaelic) that he saw more in the children offootmen and grooms than in the children of gentlemen. Apparently this remark wasinterpreted as meaning that the aristocratic guests had actually been fatheredby footmen and grooms. The Countess sentenced him to be burned; Lord Mackenziearrived home too late to save him, although he rode like the wind to try toprevent the execution. Before his death, the seer made predictions about theMackenzie (Seaforth) family, including the statement that the last of the linewould be deaf and dumb, that four sons would precede him to the tomb (one ofthem dying by water), and that his ‘white hooded’ daughter would kill hersister. In fact, the last Lord Mackenzie was born in 1754, and scarlet feverimpaired his hearing at the age of 12; in later life his speech also becameaffected. His four sons all predeceased him (one being drowned). His daughterMary married Admiral Samuel Hood, and when her husband died, her widows weedsincluded a white hood; she was driving a carriage with ponies when the animalsbolted and the carriage overturned, killing her sister.Perhaps the best-authenticated stories of accurate prediction of the futureconcerns the French essayist and occultist Jacques Cazotte, best known for hisnovel Le Diable Amoureux, in which the Devil takes the form of an attractivegirl who wins the love of a Spaniard who made the mistake of invoking him. Earlyin 1788, Cazotte (who was then 69) attended a dinner given by the Duchesse deGrammont, at which Jean de la Harpe, a well-known atheist, was present, and hewrote down at some length an account of a prophecy made by Cazotte. Afterdinner, the talk turned to the possibility of revolution, which was obviously inthe air, and which most of them (being liberals) welcomed. Cazotte suddenlydeclared that he could tell them that they would see the revolution very soon.The philosopher Condorcet asked for more information, and was told that he woulddie, lying on the floor of a prison cell, of poison that he had taken to cheatthe executioner. The dramatist Chamfort, he said, would cut his own veins, butwould die some months later. The astronomer Bailly would die at the hands of themob. The duchess herself would be taken to the scaffold with her hands tiedbehind her, as would ‘even greater ladies’. The atheist de la Harpe was told hewould become a Christian. An M. Vicq-d’Azir would die on the scaffold, as wouldM. de Nicolai.All these prophecies proved to be accurate. De la Harpe himself became a monk,and his account of the evening was found after his death in 1803. A scholarnamed Walter Borman went into the whole matter in the early 20th century andfound abundant evidence for Cazotte’s prophecy in journals and letters of thetime. (Harpe’s own ‘account’ could, of course, have been a forgery; it waspublished as part of a new edition of Le Diable Amoureux in 1871, edited byGerard de Nerval.) Moreover, the Baroness d’Oberkirch described in herautobiography (1852) how a group of people in her salon discussed Cazotte’sprophecy before it was fulfilled, and how a medium who had been brought along bythe Marquis de Puységur (the discoverer of hypnotism) had then made some evenmore astonishing prophecies about people who were present, all of which provedaccurate. Oddly enough, Cazotte failed to foretell his own death on theguillotine in 1792; but it is generally accepted that ‘prophets’ are unable toforetell their own future.The whole subject of precognition raises a fundamental question: of whether, insome sense, the future has already taken place—in other words, whether our livesare totally predetermined. In a book called Beyond the Occult, I suggested thatthe answer to that question is: probably yes.‘As I now look out of the window I can see the wind blowing washing on the lineand also swaying the syringa bush. To me, the next movement of the bush or theclothes seems purely a matter of chance; in fact, they are just as predeterminedas the movements of the stars—as the weathermen could tell you. What is true isthat human beings introduce an element of genuine chance into the picture; mywife may decide to water the garden instead of hanging out the washing. But thebushes, although alive, can introduce little chance into the picture. Moreover,even free will can be described in terms of statistics. The sociologist Durkheimwas surprised to discover that it is possible to predict the suicide rate withconsiderable precision. This seems to imply that, with sufficiently detailedknowledge, we could predict exactly who will kill himself next year.’The mathematician Laplace took a similar view. He wrote a classic book on themovements of the heavenly bodies, and remarked that if a human being hadsufficient knowledge of the present state of every particle of matter in theuniverse, he could go on to predict the whole future of the universe.Understandably, we find such a notion disturbing, for it seems to suggest thatwe are merely cogs in a gigantic machine. I go on to suggest that this negativeattitude is absurd, because we accept spatial ‘predetermination’ every daywithout concern—on the contrary, I would be very worried if I didn’t knowwhether the next bus would take me to Piccadilly or Pontefract. What is more, Irealise that spatial predetermination makes no difference to my free will; I canchoose whether to go north, south, east or west.Yet there is a paradox in all this. In Man and Time, J. B. Priestley quotes acase from Dr Louisa Rhine. A young mother had a dream in which she was campingwith some friends on the bank of a creek. She took her baby with her to the edgeof the water, intending to wash some clothes. Then she remembered that she hadleft the soap in the tent, and went back to fetch it. When she returned, thebaby was lying face down in the creek, and when she pulled him out, shediscovered he was dead.In fact, that summer she went camping with some friends, and they set up theirtents on the bank of a creek. She was just about to do some washing when sheremembered that she had forgotten the soap. At that point she remembered herdream. So instead of leaving the baby behind, she tucked him under her arm andtook him back with her to the tent.If we assume that her dream was a genuine premonition, then it saved her fromdisaster, and changed her future.Brian Inglis quotes another interesting example in his book The Power of Dreams.A girl woke up in bed one morning, and, before she opened her eyes, had a strongimpression that she was in the bed of a male colleague. He was not a man in whomshe had taken any particular interest, and, in fact, he had a girlfriend and shewas in love with someone else. When she opened her eyes, the feeling vanished.That evening, at some official university function, she and the male colleaguegot bored, and slipped out to a nearby pub. Eventually they ended up in a‘necking situation’ in a car, and he pressed her to return home with him. Shewas about to agree when she recollected her odd ‘dream’ of that morning, andchanged her mind. It struck her later that she might have averted disaster: inthose days of inadequate contraception, she might have ended up pregnant, facedwith a shotgun wedding or single parentage and the loss of her job. Sheconcluded that the ‘dream’ had been intended as a warning.Many other stories could be cited to make the same point: that premonitions canchange the future. One man (cited in Arthur Osborn’s The Future is Now) had apremonition that a car would come round a corner on the wrong side of the road;in fact, as he approached the corner later in the day he recalled hispremonition and pulled over to the other side of the road. Seconds later, thecar came round the corner at high speed.The conclusion would seem to be that the future is not predetermined as far ashuman beings are concerned—at least, not rigidly predetermined. We can affect itwith our decisions.At the time I was writing Beyond the Occult I was unaware of the discoveries of‘Chaos Theory’, developed by scientists and mathematicians like BenoitMandelbrot, Mitchell Feigenbaum, Kenneth Wilson and Edward Lorenz. Chaos theoryflatly contradicts Laplace. Edward Lorenz was responsible for the originaldiscovery in 1961, after devising a computer programme that would simulate theweather for some months ahead. In re-running a part of the programme, he decidedto save space by cutting down some decimals from six figures to three, assumingthat the difference of one part in a thousand was unimportant. In fact, thistiny difference caused an increasing change in the weather pattern of thefuture. He summarised his discovery by saying that an event as small as abutterfly flapping its wings in Siberia could alter the long-term weatherpattern. This means, in practice, that no matter how sophisticated ourcomputers, the weather pattern cannot be accurately forecast for more than a dayor so ahead. Beyond that, it begins to diverge more and more widely from theforecast.Benoit Mandelbrot cast this discovery in mathematical form (to which he gave thename of ‘fractals’.) He began by considering the question of how long is acoastline. It sounds simple enough—you merely have to trace the outline of a mapwith a small measuring device involving a wheel. But a map is a simplificationof reality. A larger, more accurate map would give a larger figure, since itwould trace all kinds of small details not included in the smaller map. In fact,every small part of the coastline would have its own extra details, and thesedetails in turn would have their own details and so on until you had reduced thecoastline to the atomic scale, and it would be impossible to get more detailed,But if a rough coastline is generated by a computer, this ‘atomic’ limit isnever reached. Imagine a giant magnifying glass, capable of infinitemagnification, getting closer and closer to a coastline generated by a computerprogramme. The coastline would go on getting more detailed forever. And themillion-millionth magnification would still look oddly similar to the first. Itis, in effect, like a decimal that can go on forever without repeating itself.Mandelbrot’s fractals also apply to the weather; its possibilities for variationare infinite. And so, scientifically speaking, chaos theory disproves the notionthat everything that happens is predetermined. The picture of the universe Isuggested in Beyond the Occult is something like a giant clock, proceedinginevitably along its predestined course. Human beings can introduce smallvariations, but on such a minute scale that they are as important as tinyfloating grains of dust in Big Ben. According to chaos theory, these grains ofdust, like the butterfly’s wings, can cause virtually infinite changes. If chaostheory is correct, the future is infinitely undetermined.And yet, just as the whole idea of precognition contradicts our commonsense viewof reality—that what has not yet happened cannot be known—so the actuality ofprecognition contradicts chaos theory. Ten days before the Titanic was due tosail, in April 1912, a man named J. Connon Middleton dreamed twice of a sinkingocean liner. Since he was due to sail on the Titanic, he was understandablyworried, and greatly relieved when the conference he was due to attend wascancelled. A marine engineer named Colin MacDonald also had premonitions ofdisaster and declined to sign on the Titanic; the man who accepted the job wasdrowned when the Titanic sank on April 14, 1912.Chaos theory states that it would be impossible to predict the weather ten daysin advance. So even if we suppose some ‘super-ESP’ that could gain access to therelevant information—about icebergs in the Atlantic, the strength of theTitanic’s hull, etc—it would still be impossible to have an accurate premonitionof the disaster.In fact, a novel called The Wreck of the Titan, published in 1898, fourteenyears before the disaster, predicts the catastrophe with uncanny accuracy: theTitan, like the Titanic, was on her maiden voyage from Southampton. It was70,000 tons; the Titanic was 66,000. Both were triple-screw vessels capable of25 knots. The Titan had 24 lifeboats, the Titanic 20. Its author, MorganRobertson, was a ‘semi-automatic’ writer, who felt that some other writer tookover when he wrote. If The Wreck of the Titan was not a genuine piece ofprecognition, then it was a highly convincing example of synchronicity.In short, it seems that we are as far as ever from some ‘scientific’ explanationof the time mystery. All that seems obvious is that there is some sense in whichour perceptions are independent of time, and that human beings therefore possessmore freedom than they realise."},{"pageContent":"14Vampires, Werewolves and ElementalsIN A BOOK CALLED The Paranormal, the psychologist Stan Gooch has described how,at the age of 26, he attended a seance in Coventry with a friend, andspontaneously fell into a trance condition. ‘And then suddenly it seemed to methat a great wind was rushing through the room. In my ears was the deafeningsound of roaring waters . . . As I felt myself swept away I became unconscious.’When he woke up, he learned that several ‘spirits’ had spoken through him. Goochhad discovered that he was a ‘medium’.It was during this period—Gooch reveals in a later book called Creatures fromInner Space—that he had his first experience of a ‘psychic invasion’. He waslying in bed one Saturday morning with his eyes closed when he felt a movementon the pillow beside his head, as if someone had gently pressed a hand againstit. The movement continued for some time; but when he opened his eyes, he wasalone.Twenty years later, lying half awake in the early morning, he became aware thatsomeone else was in bed with him. He felt that it was a composite of variousgirls he had known. ‘On this first occasion my conscious interest in thesituation got the better of me, and the succubus gradually faded away. Onsubsequent occasions, however, the presence of the entity was maintained, untilfinally we actually made love.’ He notes that, ‘From some points of view the sexis actually more satisfying than that with a real woman, because in theparanormal encounter archetypal elements are both involved and invoked.’Oddly enough, Gooch does not believe that his succubus (or female demon) wasreal; he thinks such entities are creations of the human mind. He cites cases ofhypnotised subjects who have been able to see and touch hallucinations suggestedby the hypnotist, and a book called The Story of Ruth, by Dr Morton Schatzman,describing how a girl whose father had tried to rape her as a child began tohave hallucinations of her father and believe that he was in the room with her.He seems to believe that his succubus was a similar hallucination. Yet this viewseems to be contradicted by other cases he cites in the book.The first of these concerns a policeman, Martin Pryer, who had always been‘psychic’. At one point he decided to try practising the control of hypnagogicimagery—the imagery we experience on the verge of sleep—and soon began to havealarming experiences. On one occasion, some strange entity began to cling to hisback like a limpet, and held on until he staggered across the room and switchedon the light. On another occasion, he thought that a former girlfriend wasoutside the window, and when he asked what she was doing, she replied: ‘You sentfor me.’ Then some female entity seemed to seize him from behind, clinging on tohis back; he sensed that it wanted him to make love to her ‘in a crude andviolent manner.’ After some minutes it faded away.Gooch goes on to describe the experiences of an actress friend called Sandy, whowas also ‘psychic’. One night, she woke up and felt that the spotlight in thecorner of her ceiling had changed into an eye that was watching her. Then shefelt an entity—she felt it was male—lying on top of her and trying to make loveto her. ‘One part of her was quite willing for the lovemaking to proceed, butanother part of her knew that she wanted it to stop.’ The entity became heavierand another force seemed to be dragging her down through the mattress. She madean effort to imagine that she was pulling herself up through the mattress, andthe pressure suddenly vanished. But when she went into the bathroom, shediscovered that her mouth was rimmed with dark streaks, and when she opened it,proved to be full of dried blood. There was no sign of a nosebleed or any otherinjury that could account for the blood.We have already encountered Guy Playfair’s case of ‘Marcia’, the Brazilianschoolteacher who had experiences with an ‘incubus’ after picking up a statue ofthe sea goddess Yemanjá on the beach (Chapter 9 [../Text/14_chapter09.html],page 265 [../Text/14_chapter09.html#page_265]). Such cases make it difficult toaccept Gooch’s view that these entities are some kind of hypnotic hallucination.He seems to have arrived at that conclusion because his ‘succubus’ was a blendof previous girlfriends. But on the ‘earthbound spirit’ hypothesis put forwardby Carl Wickland (Chapter 11 [../Text/16_chapter11.html]), it seems more likelythat the entity put these ideas into his mind—that is, into his imagination. Hesays: ‘In short, this entity, though possessing physical and even psychologicalattributes familiar to me, was none the less essentially its own independentself.’ And he agrees that the ‘archetypal elements’ were, to some extent,‘invoked’—that is, that he himself was conjuring them up. Sandy was able to freeherself from the ‘psychic invasion’ by imagining that she was pulling herselfback up through the mattress, indicating that the entity was controlling herimagination, not her body,We also note that these ‘psychic invasions’ occurred when all threesubjects—Gooch, Martin Pryer and Sandy—were either asleep or hovering betweensleep and waking, and therefore in a trance condition akin to mediumship.The ‘succubus’ (or incubus) was, as the Rev. Montague Summers states in his bookThe Vampire, an early version of that mythical creature the vampire orblood-drinker. And the various accounts of possession we have considered seem tolead naturally to the question: was the vampire real, or is it—as most sensiblepeople assume—just a myth?The vampire as depicted in stories like Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897) is a kindof walking corpse that drinks blood. Stoker based his character on a realhistorical personage: Vlad Tepes (the Impaler), King of Wallachia (1456–77) was,as his nickname implies, a man of sadistic temperament whose greatest pleasurewas to impale his ‘enemies’ (which meant anyone against whom he had a grudge) onpointed stakes; the stake—driven into the ground—was inserted into the anus (or,in the case of women, the vagina), and the victim was allowed to slowly impalehimself under his own weight—Vlad often had the point blunted to make the agonylast longer. In his own time he was known as Dracula, which means son of adragon (or of the devil). It is estimated that Dracula had about 100,000 peopleimpaled during the course of his lifetime. When he conquered Brasov, inTransylvania, he had all its inhabitants impaled on poles, then gave a feastamong the corpses. When one nobleman held his nose at the stench, Vlad sent fora specially long pole and had him impaled. When he was a prisoner in Hungary,Vlad was kept supplied with birds, rats and toads, which he impaled on smallstakes. A brave and fearless warrior, he was finally killed in battle—orpossibly assassinated by his own soldiers—and his head sent to Constantinople.Four hundred and twenty years later, in 1897, he was immortalised by Bram Stokeras the sinister Count Dracula, no longer a sadistic maniac, but a drinker ofblood . . .1But how did the legend of the blood-drinking vampire begin? The story firstreached Europe soon after 1718, when Charles VI, Emperor of Austria, drove theTurks out of Eastern Europe, which they had dominated for the past fourcenturies, marching in and out of Transylvania, Wallachia and Hungary and evenconquering Constantinople (1453). Don John of Austria defeated them at the greatsea battle of Lepanto (1571), but it was their failure to capture Vienna after asiege in 1683 that caused the break-up of the Ottoman empire. During the earlierstages of this war between Europe and Turkey, Vlad the Impaler struck blow afterblow against the Turks, until they killed and beheaded him in 1477. When theTurks were finally defeated, two hundred and forty-one years later, theirconquerors were intrigued to hear strange stories about dead people who couldcause death to the living. Such stories had been known to travellers in Greecedown the centuries. There the vampire was known as the vrykolakas, and onJanuary 1, 1701, a French botanist named Pitton de Tornefort had visited theisland of Mykonos and been present at a gruesome scene of dissection. An unnamedpeasant, of sullen and quarrelsome disposition, was murdered in the fields bypersons unknown. Two days after burial, his ghost was reported to be wanderingaround at night, overturning furniture and ‘playing a thousand roguish tricks’.Ten days after his burial, a mass was said to ‘drive out the demon’ that wasbelieved to be in the corpse, after which the body was disinterred, and thelocal butcher given the task of tearing out the heart. His knowledge of anatomyseemed to be defective, and he tore open the stomach and rummaged around in theintestines, causing such a vile stench that incense had to be burned. In thesmoke-filled church, people began shouting ‘Vrykolakas’ and alleging that someof the smoke poured out of the corpse itself.Even after the heart had been burned on the seashore, the ghost continued tocause havoc, until the villagers finally burnt the corpse on a pyre.De Tornefort takes a highly superior attitude about all this, convinced that itis simply mass hysteria. ‘I have never viewed anything so pitiable as the stateof this island. Everyone’s head was turned; the wisest people were stricken likethe others.’ Although the year is only 1701, de Tornefort’s attitude is that ofa typical French rationalist of the 18th century.Attitudes began to change after 1718, as the highly circumstantial accounts ofvampires began to reach western Europe—just how precise and circumstantial isillustrated by the following report, known as Visum et Repertum (Seen andDiscovered), which dates from 1732, and was witnessed by no less than fiveAustrian officers:‘After it had been reported in the village of Medvegia (near Belgrade) thatso-called vampires had killed some people by sucking their blood, I was, by highdecree of a local Honorable Supreme Command, sent there to investigate thematter thoroughly, along with officers detailed for that purpose and twosubordinate medical officers, and therefore carried out and heard the presentenquiry in the company of the Captain of the Stallath company of haiduks,Hadnack Gorschiz, the standard-bearer and the oldest haiduk of the village.(They reported), unanimously, as follows. About five years ago, a local haidukcalled Arnod Paole broke his neck in a fall from a hay wagon. This man had,during his lifetime, often described how, near Gossova in Turkish Serbia, he hadbeen troubled by a vampire, wherefore he had eaten from the earth of thevampire’s grave and had smeared himself with the vampire’s blood, in order to befree of the vexation he had suffered. In twenty or thirty days after his death,some people complained that they were being bothered by this same Arnod Paole;and in fact, four people were killed by him. In order to end this evil, they dugup Arnod Paole forty days after his death—this on the advice of their Hadnack,who had been present at such events before; and they found that he was quitecomplete and undecayed, and that fresh blood had flowed from his eyes, nose,mouth and ears; that the shirt, the covering and the coffin were completelyblood; that the old nails on his hands and feet, along with the skin, had fallenoff, and that new ones had grown. And since they saw from this that he was atrue vampire, they drove a stake through his heart—according to theircustom—whereupon he gave an audible groan and bled copiously. Thereupon theyburned the body to ashes the same day and threw these into the grave. These samepeople also say that all those who have been tormented and killed by vampiresmust themselves become vampires. Therefore they disinterred the above-mentionedfour people in the same way. Then they also add that this same Arnod Paoleattacked not only people but cattle, and sucked out their blood. And since somepeople ate the flesh of such cattle, it would appear that (this is the reasonthat) some vampires are again present here, inasmuch as in a period of threemonths, seventeen young and old people died, among them some who, with noprevious illness, died in two or at most three days. In addition, the haidukJovitsa reports that his stepdaughter, by name Stanacka, lay down to sleepfifteen days ago, fresh and healthy, but that at midnight she started up out ofher sleep with a terrible cry, fearful and trembling, and complained that shehad been throttled by the son of a haiduk by the name of Milloe (who had diednine weeks earlier), whereupon she had experienced a great pain in the chest,and become worse hour by hour, until finally she died on the third day.‘At this, we went the same afternoon to the graveyard, along with theaforementioned oldest haiduks of the village, in order to cause the suspiciousgraves to be opened, and to examine the bodies in them. Whereby, after all ofthem had been (exhumed and) dissected, the following was found:‘1. A woman by the name of Stana, 20 years old, who had died in childbirth twomonths ago, after a three days illness, and who had herself said before herdeath that she had painted herself with the blood of a vampire—wherefore bothshe and the child, which had died soon after birth and through careless burialhad been half eaten by dogs—must also become vampires. She was quite completeand undecayed. After the opening of the body there was found in the cavitatepectoris a quantity of fresh extravascular blood. The vessels of the arteriae,like the ventriculis cordis, were not, as is usual, filled with coagulatedblood; and the whole viscera—that is, the lung, liver, stomach, spleen andintestines—were quite fresh, as they would be in a healthy person. The uteruswas however quite enlarged and very inflamed externally, for the placenta andlochia had remained in place, wherefore the same was in complete putrefaction.The skin on her hands and feet, along with the old nails, fell away on theirown, but on the other hand completely new nails were evident, along with a freshand vivid skin.‘2. There was a woman by the name of Militsa, 60 years old, who had died after athree month sickness and had been buried ninety or so days earlier. In the chestmuch liquid blood was found, and the other viscera were—like those mentionedabove—in good condition. During her dissection, all the haiduks who werestanding around marvelled greatly at her plumpness and perfect body, uniformlystating that they had known the woman well from her youth, and that she hadthroughout her life been very lean and dried up; they emphasised that she hadcome to such surprising plumpness in the grave. They also said that it was shewho had started the vampires this time, because she had been eating of the fleshof those sheep who had been killed by previous vampires.‘3. There was an eight-day old child which had lain in the grave for ninetydays, and which was also in a condition of vampirism.‘4. The son of a haiduk, 16 years old, named Milloe, was dug up, having lain inthe earth for nine weeks, after he had died from a three day illness, and wasfound to be like the other vampires. [This is obviously the vampire who hadattacked the stepdaughter of the haiduk Jovitsa.]‘Joachim, also the son of a haiduk, 17 years old, had died after a three dayillness. He had been buried eight weeks and four days and, on being dissected,was found in similar condition.‘6. A woman by the name of Ruscha who had died after a ten day illness and beenburied six weeks earlier, in whom there was much fresh blood, not only in thechest but also in fundo ventriculi. The same showed itself in her child, whichwas eighteen days old, and had died five weeks earlier.‘7. No less did a girl of 10 years of age, who had died two months previously,find herself in the above-mentioned condition, quite complete and undecayed, andhad much fresh blood in her chest . . .‘8. They caused the wife of the Hadnack to be dug up, along with her child. Shehad died seven weeks earlier, her child—who was eight weeks old—twenty one dayspreviously, and it was found that mother and child were completely decomposed,although earth and grave were like those of the vampires lying nearby.‘9. A servant of the local corporal of the haiduks, by the name of Rhade, 23years old, died after a three month illness, and after being buried five weeks,was found completely decomposed.‘10. The wife of the local standard bearer, along with her child, were alsocompletely decomposed.‘11. With Stanche, a haiduk, 60 years old, who had died six weeks previously, Inoticed a profuse liquid blood, like the others, in the chest and stomach. Theentire body was in the above mentioned condition of vampirism.‘12. Milloe, a haiduk, 25 years old, who had lain for six weeks in the earth,was also found in a condition of vampirism.‘13. Stanoicka, (earlier called Stanacka), the wife of a haiduk, 23 years old,died after a three day illness, and had been buried eighteen days earlier. Inthe dissection I found that her countenance was quite red and of a vivid colour;as was mentioned above, she had been throttled at midnight, by Milloe, the sonof a haiduk, and there was also to be seen, on the right side under the ear, abloodshot blue mark (i.e. a bruise) the length of a finger (demonstrating thatshe had been throttled). As she was being taken out of the grave, a quantity offresh blood flowed from her nose. With the dissection I found—as so oftenmentioned already—a regular fragrant fresh bleeding, not only in the chestcavity, but also in the heart ventricle. All the viscera were found in acompletely good and healthy condition. The skin of the entire body, along withthe nails on the hands and feet, were as though completely fresh.‘After the examination had taken place, the heads of the vampires were cut offby the local gypsies, and then burned along with the bodies, after which theashes were thrown into the river Morava. The decomposed bodies, however, werelaid back in their own graves. Which I attest along with those assistant medicalofficers provided for me. Actum ut supra:‘L.S. (Signed) Johannes Fluchinger, Regimental Medical Officer of the FootRegiment of the Honorable B. Furstenbusch.‘L.S. J.H. Sigel, Medical Officer of the Honorable Morall Regiment.‘L.S. Johann Friedrich Baumgarten, Medical Officer of the Foot Regiment of theHonorable B. Furstenbusch.‘The undersigned attest herewith that all which the Regiment Medical officer ofthe Honorable Furstenbusch had observed in the matter of vampires—along withboth medical officers who signed with him—is in every way truthful, and has beenundertaken, observed and examined in our own presence. In confirmation thereofis our signature in our own hand, of our own making, Belgrade, January 26, 1732.‘L.S. Buttener, Lieutenant Colonel of the Honorable Alexandrian Regiment.‘L.S. J.H. von Lindenfels, Officer of the Honorable Alexandrian Regiment.’The first thing we note in this account is that the ‘vampires’ were obviouslynot able to get up and walk out of their graves, since they were sealed in theircoffins. It was clearly their spirits that caused the trouble. And the girlStanacka was not attacked in the manner we associate with Dracula—by thevampire’s fangs—but was apparently throttled. Moreover, we note in the case ofthe vrykolakas reported by the French botanist Tornefort that the vampirewandered around the town ‘playing a thousand roguish tricks’. This sounds morelike a poltergeist than the traditional vampire. Another vampire described in alengthy official report of 1725, Peter Plogojowitz, also seems to have come tohis victims ‘in their sleep, laid himself upon them, and throttled them’. Butsomeone who is throttled dies immediately. In vampire reports we have people wholived on—like Stanacka—for days. It sounds as if the vampire is draining theirvitality, not their blood. This would, of course, produce a feeling ofsuffocation, or throttling. In other words, the vampire seems to be a demonicentity that possesses the victim, as in so many of the cases we encountered inChapter 11 [../Text/16_chapter11.html], causing them to die of exhaustion, likeFather Tranquille in the Loudun case.The details of the blood in the chest of the exhumed vampire seems puzzling,until we note that the blood is found in the breast cavity (cavitate pectoris)of the woman called Stana, while the lungs are mentioned separately in the samesentence. If she had been drinking blood, it would be in the stomach, not thebreast cavity. The blood found in the chest is presumably the vampire’s own, andis merely a proof that the creature is ‘undead’.Now, in fact, reports of ‘lamias’, or predatory ghosts, date back to ancientGreece—Keats’s poem Lamia tells a traditional story about one, which he borrowsfrom a biography of the magician Apollonius of Tyana by Philostratus.There are even earlier accounts of the walking dead. The French expert onvampires, Jean Marigny, remarks:‘Well, before the 18th century, the epoch when the word “vampire” firstappeared, people believed in Europe that the dead were able to rise from theirgraves to suck the blood of the living. The oldest chronicles in Latin mentionmanifestations of this type, and their authors, instead of employing the word“vampire” (which did not yet exist) utilised a term just as explicit, the word“sanguisugae” (Latin for leech, bloodsucker). The oldest of these chroniclesdate from the 12th and 13th centuries, and, contrary to what one might expect,are not set in remote parts of Europe, but in England and Scotland.’1He goes on to cite four cases described by the 12th century chronicler Williamof Newburgh, author of Historia Rerum Anglicarum. These are too long to citehere (although they can be found in full in Montague Summers’ The Vampire inEurope). The first, ‘Of the extraordinary happening when a dead man wanderedabroad out of his grave’, describes a case in Buckinghamshire, recounted to thechronicler by the local archdeacon. It describes how a man returned from thegrave the night after his burial, and attacked his wife. When this happenedagain the following night, the wife asked various neighbours to spend the nightwith her, and their shouts drove the ghost away. Then the ghost began to createa general disturbance in the town, attacking animals and alarming people. Thathe was a ghost, and not a physical body, is proved by the comment that somepeople could see him while others could not (although they ‘perceptibly felt hishorrible presence’). The archdeacon consulted the bishop, Hugh of Lincoln,who—on the advice of various learned men—suggested that the body should be dugup and burnt to ashes. Then he decided this would be ‘undesirable’, and insteadwrote out a charter of absolution. When the tomb was opened, the body proved tobe ‘uncorrupt’, just as on the day it was buried. The absolution was placed onhis chest and the grave closed again; after that, the ghost ceased to wanderabroad.One of William of Newburgh’s other accounts sounds slightly more like thetraditional vampire in that the ghost—of a wealthy man who had died at Berwickon Tweed—had an odour of decomposition which affected the air and caused plague.The body was exhumed (it is not recorded whether it was undecayed) and burned.Stories like these have the touches of absurdity that might be expected from aneccesiastical chronicler of that period; yet their similarity to the otherchronicles cited suggests that they have some common basis. The same applies toanother work. De Nugis Curialium by Walter Map (1193), also cited at length bySummers.All these cases took place long before Western Europe heard tales of vampiresfrom former Turkish dominions, and in only one of them is there is anysuggestion of blood-drinking. But in most ways, the revenants behave very muchlike Peter Plogojowitz and the vampires of Medvegia. They haunt the living,climb into bed with people when they are asleep, and then throttle them, leavingthem drained of energy. And when the bodies are disinterred, they are found tobe undecayed. It seems very clear that there is no basic difference between thevampires of 1732 and the revenants of the 12th century. And when we look moreclosely into the accounts of the vampires, we discover that they areenergy-suckers rather than blood suckers. Peter Plogojowitz has fresh blood onhis mouth, but it is merely a matter of hearsay that he sucked the blood of hisvictims—the account mentions only throttling. Otherwise, these earlier revenantsbehave very much like the paranormal phenomenon known as the poltergeist.Two 16th century cases also bear a close resemblance to the later vampirelegends. One is known as known as the Shoemaker of Breslau, and is to be foundin Henry’s More’s Antidote Against Atheism of 1653. This describes how, onSeptember 21, 1591, a well-to-do shoemaker of Breslau, in Silesia—one accountgives his name as Weinrichius—cut his throat with a knife, and soon after diedfrom the wound. Since suicide was regarded as a mortal sin, his wife tried toconceal it, and announced that her husband had died of a stroke. An old womanwas taken into the secret, and she washed the body and bound up the throat soskilfully that the wound was invisible. A priest who came to comfort the widowwas taken to view the corpse, and noticed nothing suspicious. The shoemaker wasburied on the following day, September 22, 1591.Perhaps because of this unseemly haste, and the refusal of the wife to allowneighbours to view the body, a rumour sprang up that the shoemaker had committedsuicide. After this, his ghost began to be seen in the town. Soon it wasclimbing into bed with people and squeezing them so hard that it left the marksof its fingers on their flesh. This finally became such a nuisance that in theyear following the burial, on April 18, 1592, the council ordered the grave tobe opened. The body was complete and undamaged by decay, but ‘blown up like adrum’. On his feet the skin had peeled away, and another had grown, ‘much purerand stronger than the first.’ He had a ‘mole like a rose’ on his big toe—whichwas interpreted as a witch’s mark—and there was no smell of decay, except in theshroud itself. Even the wound in the throat was undecayed. The corpse was laidunder a gallows, but the ghost continued to appear. By May 7, it had grown ‘muchfuller of flesh’. Finally, the council ordered that the corpse should bebeheaded and dismembered. When the body was opened up, the heart was found to be‘as good as that of a freshly slaughtered calf. Finally, the body was burnt on ahuge bonfire of wood and pitch, and the ashes thrown into the river. After this,the ghost ceased to appear.Paul Barber, citing the case in Vampires, Burial and Death, agrees that ‘much inthis story is implausible’, but points out that so many details—notably thedescription of the body—are so precise as to leave no doubt ‘that we are dealingwith real events’.But what are these ‘real events’? Before we comment further, let us consideranother well known case from the same year, 1592, (which is, of course, morethan a century earlier than the famous vampire outbreak in eastern Europe). Thisis also to be found in More, and concerns an alderman of Pentsch (or Pentach) inSilesia named Johannes Cuntze (whose name More latinises to Cuntius). On his wayto dinner with the mayor, Cuntze tried to examine a loose shoe of a mettlesomehorse, and received a kick, presumably on the head. The blow seems to haveunsettled his reason; he complained that he was a great sinner, and that hisbody was burning. He also refused to see a priest. This gave rise to all kindsof rumours about him, including that he had made a pact with the devil.As Cuntze was dying, with his son beside the bed, the casement opened and ablack cat jumped into the room and leapt on to Cuntze’s face, scratching himbadly; he died soon after. At his funeral on February 8, 1592, ‘a great tempestarose’, which continued to rage as he was buried beside the altar of the localchurch.Before he was buried, there were stories that his ghost had appeared andattempted to rape a woman. After the burial, the ghost began to behave like amischievous hobgoblin, throwing things about, opening doors, and causing bangingnoises so that ‘the whole house shaked again’—on the morning after these events,animal footprints or hoofmarks were found outside in the snow. His widow had themaid sleeping in her bed; the ghost of Cuntze appeared and demanded to beallowed to take his proper place beside his wife. And the parson of the parish(who is mentioned as the chronicler of these events) dreamed that Cuntze was‘squeezing’ him, and woke up feeling utterly exhausted. The spirit was also ableto cause a nauseating stench to fill the room.The conclusion is much as in the story of the shoemaker of Breslau. Cuntze wasfinally disinterred on July 20, five months after his burial, and was found tobe undecayed, and when a vein in the leg was opened, the blood that ran out was‘as fresh as the living’. After having been transported to the bonfire with somedifficulty—his body had apparently become as heavy as a stone—he was dismembered(the blood was found to be quite fresh) and burnt to ashes.So the earlier vampire stories are very clearly about poltergeists, notblood-drinkers. And the Greek and eastern European cases bear a strongresemblance to stories of ‘demonic possession’, like so many reported in Chapter11 [../Text/16_chapter11.html].If we can once concede the possibility of ‘psychic invasion’, as well as thepossibility of ‘spirits’, then the notion of vampires suddenly seems lessabsurd. In The Magus of Strovolos, an American academic, Kyriacos C. Markides,has described his friendship with a modern Cypriot mystic and ‘magus’, SpyrosSathi, known as Daskalos, who lives in Nicosia. Daskalos takes the actualreality of spirits for granted. It also becomes clear that Daskalos takes‘possession’ for granted, and Markides tells a number of stories, in some ofwhich he was personally involved.There are, Daskalos, claims, three kinds of possession: by ill-disposed humanspirits, by demonic entities, and by elementals (the latter being human thoughtsand desires which have taken on a life of their own). And he goes on to describea case of spirit possession of the first type: Daskalos was approached by theparents of a girl who claimed that she was being haunted by the spirit of herdead fiancé. Although they had lived together, she had refused to allow him topossess her until they were married. He died of tuberculosis, haunted byunfulfilled cravings. ‘Each night before she would go to bed he wouldsemi-hypnotise her and induce her to keep the window of her room open. He wouldthen enter inside a bat and would come to her. The bat would wedge itself on herneck and draw blood and etheric (energy).’ The local priest told Daskalos how todeal with it. He must wait in the next room, and when he heard the bat entering,should go in and quickly shut the window; then, since the bat would attack him,he must stun it with a broom. Then he must wrap the bat in a towel and burn itin a brasier (stove). Daskalos did this, and as the bat burned, the girlscreamed and groaned. Then she calmed down and asked: ‘Why were you trying toburn me?’ The ‘haunting’ ceased thereafter.Daskalos told another story that has elements of vampirism. On a journey insouthern Greece he had encountered another girl who was being haunted by aformer lover. A shepherd who had been in love with her had died in a motoraccident. Five years later, when looking for some goats, the girl saw theshepherd—whose name was Loizo—and he followed her, finally making her feel verysleepy so she felt obliged to sit down. He then ‘hypnotised’ her, and caused herto experience intense sexual pleasure. When she reported the incident, she wasmedically examined and found to be a virgin. But three days later the shepherdcame to her bed and made love to her. Medical examination revealed she was nolonger a virgin. Daskalos noticed two reddish spots on her neck. ‘He kisses methere, but his kisses are strange. They are like sucking, and I like them.’Daskalos claimed that, two days later, he saw the shepherd coming into the houseand greeted him. Loizo explained that he had wanted the girl for many years, andhad never had sexual relations with a woman—only with animals like donkeys andgoats. Now he was possessing her, he had no intention of letting her go. Herefused to believe it when Daskalos told him he was dead. Daskalos warned himthat if he persisted in possessing the girl, he would remain ‘in a narcotisedstate like a vampire’. His arguments finally convinced the shepherd, who agreedto go away.The doctor who examined the girl believed that she had torn the hymen with herown fingers; Daskalos seems to accept this, but believes that Loizo made her dothis.These two cases, taken in conjunction with the others we have considered, offersome interesting clues about the nature of the vampire. According to Daskalos,the ‘earthbound spirit’ of the dead fiancé was able to enter an ordinary bat andthen to suck her blood. This was an expression of his sexual desire, his desireto possess her. There had been many cases in the history of sex crime ofso-called ‘vampirism’. In the early 1870s, an Italian youth named VincentVerzeni murdered three women and attempted to strangle several more. Verzeni waspossessed by a powerful desire to throttle women (and even birds and animals).After throttling a 14-year-old girl named Johanna Motta, he disembowelled herand drank her blood. Verzeni admitted that it gave him keen pleasure to sniffwomen’s clothing, and ‘it satisfied me to seize women by the neck and suck theirblood’. So it is easy to imagine that the earth-bound fiancé mentioned byDaskalos should enjoy drinking the girl’s blood. But we can also see that hisdesire to ‘possess’ her was also satisfied in another way—by somehow controllingher imagination. As the bat was burning, the girl cried out, ‘Why are you tryingto burn me?’.Again, in the case of Loizo, we can see that the shepherd had entered the girl’sbody and taken possession of her imagination, enough to cause her to tear herown hymen with her fingers. This implies—as we would expect—that the lovemakingwas not on the physical level, since Loizo possessed no body.All this has an interesting implications. The act of lovemaking seems to involvea paradox, since it is an attempt at interpenetration by two bodies, an attemptwhich is doomed to failure by their separateness. Plato expresses the paradox inan amusing myth. Human beings were originally spherical beings who possessed thecharacteristics of both sexes. Because their sheer vitality made them achallenge to the gods, Zeus decided that they had to be enfeebled. So he slicedthem all down the centre, ‘as you and I might slice an apple’, and turned theirfaces back to front. And now the separated parts spent their lives in adesperate search for their other half, and they ceased to constitute a challengeto the gods.It is also clear that, in its crudest form, the male sexual urge is basically adesire for ‘possession’, and that the act of physical penetration is an act ofaggression, (Most writers on Dracula have noted that it is basically a rapefantasy.). As a man holds a woman in his arms, he experiences a desire to absorbher, to blend with her, and the actual penetration is only a token union. So wemight say that a ‘vampire’ like Loizo is able to achieve what every lover dreamsabout: a possession that involves total interpenetration.The notion of vampirism that begins to emerge from all this is simple and(provided one can accept the notion of ‘earthbound spirits’) plausible. Daskalostold Markides that those who commit suicide may become trapped in the ‘ethericof the gross material world’, unable to move to the higher psychic planes. Asuicide dies in ‘a state of despair and confusion’, and ‘may vibrate too closeto the material world, which will not allow him to find rest’. He becomes a‘hungry ghost’, wandering in and out of the minds of human beings like a manwandering through a deserted city. Yet he is incapable of influencing hisinvoluntary host, or of making his presence felt, unless the host also happensto be on the same ‘wavelength’ and to share the same desires.Vampirism, then, involves the notion—which we have already encountered inWickland’s Thirty years Among the Dead—that ‘earthbound spirits’ are attractedby the vitality of the human aura, and may do their best to share it. A bookcalled Hungry Ghosts, by the journalist Joe Fisher, makes this point with greatforce. Fisher had written a book about reincarnation, in the course of which hehad become convinced of its reality. One day, after being interviewed on radioin Toronto (where he lives), he received a phone call from a woman who explainedthat she had accidentally become a mouthpiece of ‘discarnate entities’. She wasbeing hypnotised in an attempt to cure her of leukaemia, and various ‘spiritguides’ had begun speaking through her mouth. (Myers points out that a ‘spirit’can only enter a body when the usual ‘tenant’ is absent, a point to note whenconsidering that early accounts of vampires involve attack during sleep.)The first time Fisher went to her house, a ‘spirit’ named Russell spoke throughher mouth with a reassuring Yorkshire accent, and told him that he had a female‘guide’, a Greek girl named Filipa, who had been his mistress in a previousexistence three centuries earlier. This struck Fisher as plausible, since he hadalways felt some affinity with Greece. He began attending the seances regularly,and devoting some time every morning to relaxing and trying to contact Filipa.Eventually he succeeded; buzzing noises in his ears would be succeeded by afeeling of bliss and communication. Filipa was a sensual little creature wholiked to be hugged, and Fisher implies that, in some sense, they became lovers.It broke up his current love affair; his live-in girlfriend felt she was nomatch for a ghost.Other people at the seances were told about their ‘guides’ or guardian angels.One guide was an ex-RAF pilot named Ernest Scott, another an amusing cockneynamed Harry Maddox. Fisher’s disillusionment began when, on a trip back toEngland, he decided to try and verify Ernest Scott’s war stories—with no doubtwhatever that they would prove genuine. The airfield was certainly genuine; sowas the squadron Ernest claimed to have belonged to; the descriptions of wartimeraids were accurate; so were the descriptions of the squadron’s moves fromairfield to airfield. But there had been no Ernest Scott in the squadron, and along search in the Public Record Office failed to throw up his name. Fisher wentback to Canada in a bitter mood and accused Ernest of lying. Ernest strenuouslydenied it. Anyway, he said, he was due to reincarnate in another body, so had toleave . . . The ‘guide’ Russell later told Fisher that Ernest had been reborn inEngland, and gave the name of the parents and date of birth. Oddly enough, whenFisher checked on this it proved to be accurate. He even contacted the parents,who were intrigued, but decided they had no wish to get more deeply involved.With Russell’s approval, Fisher tried to track down the farm in Yorkshire whereRussell claimed he had lived in the 19th century. Here again, many of the factsRussell had given about the Harrogate area proved to be accurate; but again, thecrucial facts were simply wrong. It seemed that Russell was also a liar. And so,upon investigation, was the loveable World War One veteran Harry Maddox. Hisaccounts of World War One battles were accurate; but Harry did not exist.Finally, Fisher took his search to Greece. In spite of his disillusion with theother guides, he had no doubt whatever that Filipa was genuine. She possessed,he states early in the book, ‘more love, compassion and perspicacity than I hadever known’. The problem was that all his attempts to locate Theros—a villagenear the Turkish border—in atlases or gazetteers had failed. Yet that could bebecause it had been destroyed by the Turks in the past three centuries. But atown called Alexandroupoli, which Filipa had mentioned, still existed. After along and frustrating search for the remains of Theros, Fisher went toAlexandroupoli, a city that he assumed had been founded by Alexander the Great.But a brochure there disillusioned him. Alexandroupoli was a mere two centuriesold; it had not even existed at the time when he and Filipa were supposed tohave been lovers . . . Like the others, Filipa was a liar and a deceiver.In a chapter called ‘Siren Call of the Hungry Ghosts’, Fisher tries to analysewhat has happened to him. And the answer seems simple. He had been involved withwhat Kardec called ‘earthbound spirits’, spirits who either do not realise theyare dead, or have such a craving to remain on earth that they remain attached toit. These earthbound spirits or, in Tibetan Buddhist phraseology, pretas or‘hungry ghosts’, are individuals whose minds, at the point of physical death,have been incapable of disentangling from desire. Thus enslaved, the personalitybecomes trapped on the lower planes even as it retains, for a while, its memoryand individuality. Hence the term ‘lost soul’, a residual entity that is no morethan an astral corpse-in-waiting. It has condemned itself to perish; it haschosen a ‘second death’. He quotes Lt-Col.Arthur E.Powell, in a book called TheAstral Body: ‘Such spooks are conscienceless, devoid of good impulses, tendingtowards disintegration, and consequently can work for evil only, whether weregard them as prolonging their vitality by vampirising at seances, or pollutingthe medium and sitters with astral connections of an altogether undesirablekind.’He also cites the modern American expert on ‘out of the body’ journeys, RobertMonroe: ‘Monroe tells of encountering a zone next to the Earth plane populatedby the ‘dead’ who couldn’t or wouldn’t realise they were no longer physicalbeings . . . The beings he perceived kept trying to be physical, to do and bewhat they had been, to continue physical one way or another. Bewildered, somespent all of their activity in attempting to communicate with friends and lovedones still in bodies or with anyone else who might come along.’The conclusion would seem to be that the vampire cannot be dismissed as a myth.But the reality of vampirism has very little in common with the Dracula legend.There is no fundamental difference betwaeen vampires and poltergeists—exceptthat, fortunately, vampire phenomena seem to be far more infrequent.And what of the vampire’s equally celebrated cousin, the werewolf? Here, as inthe case of the vampire, we have many highly circumstantial reports: in the onehundred and ten years between 1520 and 1630, there are thirty thousand incentral France alone. (Here they were called loup-garous.) But there are alsoreports from Great Britain, Germany, Hungary, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Norway,Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Iceland, Lapland and Finland. So it is difficult todismiss them, as Rossell Hope Robbins does in his Encyclopedia of Witchcraft andDemonology, as a sign of superstition or madness. A typical report is asfollows. In 1598 a 16-year-old boy named Benoit Bidel, who lived at Naizan inthe Jura region of France, was found dying from a stab wound. He claimed that hehad climbed a tree and was picking fruit when his sister, who was down below,was attacked by a wolf. The boy tried to fight off the wolf with a knife, but heclaimed that the wolf had snatched the knife from him—it had human hands—andstabbed him. The boy died, and a search of the area was made; a semi-imbecilegirl named Perrennette Gandillon was found. Deciding that she might be thewerewolf, the townspeople killed her. Then someone remembered that her brotherPierre was scarred with scratches; he was arrested, together with his sisterAntoinette and his son George. All three confessed to being werewolves. JudgeHenri Boguet, author of Discourse on Sorcerers, visited the Gandillons in jailand said that they ran around on all fours. They confessed that they had turnedthemselves into wolves with the aid of a witch’s salve, and that they hadattended ‘Sabbats’. All three were sentenced to death and burned. Rossell HopeRobbins takes the commonsense view that all three were insane. Anotherinteresting possibility is suggested by Neville Drury and Stephen Skinner in TheSearch for Abraxas (1971). Discussing Carlos Castaneda and his Don Juan books,they note that Castaneda described how the ‘witch doctor’ Don Juan had taughthim to make a paste of the root of the datura plant, also called Devil’s Weed,and how, when he rubbed it on his body, he felt he was flying at great speedthrough the air. Is it possible, ask the authors, that the witches’ salves ofpast centuries were made of some similar substance that produced thehallucination that they were flying? (In fact, Lord Lytton had already made sucha suggestion in his occult novel A Strange Story.) Of course, much ofCastaneda’s work has been discredited since astute critics noticed that hisbooks were full of factual contradictions, especially regarding dates; yet thisparticular suggestion remains highly plausible.In studying the reports of werewolves one thing becomes clear: the werewolf wasvery closely bound up with witchcraft. The Gandillon family, whether they wereinsane or not, believed that they had attended witches’ Sabbats and that theywere able to turn themselves into wolves by means of a salve. They believed thattheir powers came ultimately from the Devil. It is interesting to note thatPierre Gandillon fell into a trance on Maundy Thursday and, when he hadrecovered, claimed to have attended a Sabbat of werewolves. He believed, then,that he attended these Sabbats ‘in the spirit’ rather than in the flesh, abelief which ties in with theories of ‘astral bodies’. Indeed according to the19th-century French ‘magician’ Eliphas Lévi, a werewolf is simply the astralbody of the sorcerer projected into the shape of a wolf.It is undoubtedly true that many ‘werewolves’ were people who suffered fromdelusions. In 1603 a mentally defective youth named Jean Grenier claimed to somegirls that he was a werewolf; when he was arrested, he implicated his father anda neighbour. In fact, children had been attacked in the area. But the Parlementof Bordeaux took a surprisingly reasonable view for that period and accepted thefather’s explanation that his son was an imbecile; Jean was placed in custody ina monastery, where he died a few years later.In other cases, the explanation may be less simple. In the late 16th century thecase of a ‘werewolf named Peter Stubbe caused a great stir all over Europe.There had been many wolf attacks in the Cologne area; after a wolf had attackeda group of children, nearly tearing the throat out of one of them, a hunt wasorganized; the wolf vanished, but the hunters found a man—Peter Stubbe—walkingtowards Cologne in the area where the wolf had apparently vanished. Undertorture Stubbe confessed to being a werewolf, claiming that he was a witch andthat the Devil had given him a magic belt (which was never found) which enabledhim to transform himself. He admitted to incest with his sister and daughter,with whom he had had a child. He claimed that he had killed many children, aswell as large numbers of sheep, lambs, and goats, over a period of twenty-fiveyears. He was broken on the wheel, his flesh pulled off with red hot pincers,and then decapitated; his daughter and sister were sentenced to be burned.In mediaeval Europe, wolves were the commonest and most dangerous beasts ofprey, and the sexual obsessions that drove Isobel Gowdie caused sexuallyfrustrated peasants to identify with wolves. But the most curious question ishow far their obsession caused actual physical changes. William Seabrook has aremarkable description of how a Russian emigrée woman meditated on hexagram 49from the I Ching, whose meaning is associated with an animal’s fur, and withmoulting. She imagined herself to be a wolf in the snow, then began to makebaying noises, and slaver at the mouth. When one of the witnesses attempted towake her up, she leapt at his throat and tried to bite it. In the case of GillesGarnier, executed as a werewolf in 1574, he seems to have carried out theattacks on children either in the shape of a man or a wolf. The charge, drawn upat Dôle, alleged that he had seized a 12-year-old girl and killed her in avineyard with his hands and teeth, then dragged her along the ground—with histeeth—into the wood at La Serre, where he ate most of her. He so enjoyed it thathe took some home for his wife. (This does not indicate that she was also aloup-garou; three hundred years later, in the same area, a peasant named MartinDumollard made a habit of murdering girls that he lured into lonely places, andtaking their clothes to his wife. He would say, ‘I’ve murdered another girl,’and then go off with a spade. She seems to have regarded these activities as asign of mild eccentricity.) Garnier killed a 12-year-old boy in a wood, and wasabout to eat the flesh (‘although it was a Friday’) when he was interrupted bysome men. They testified that he was in human form, and Gamier agreed. But heinsisted that he was in the shape of a wolf when he strangled a 10-year-old boyand tore off the leg with his fangs; he does not explain how a wolf couldstrangle anybody. He also attacked another 10-year-old girl—again wearing hiswolf-shape—but was forced to flee when interrupted; she died of her wounds. Onthis occasion, the peasants who interrupted Garnier saw him as a wolf, butnevertheless thought they recognised Garnier’s face. He was sentenced to beburned alive.The rational explanation is that Stubbe and Garnier confessed to a great deal ofnonsense under torture, and this is possible. But it is surely more significantthat the great majority of werewolf reports date from the same period as thewitchcraft trials in Europe, and that many ‘werewolves’, like the Gandillons,confessed to being witches. Our study of witchcraft has left no doubt that themajority of cases were miscarriages of justice, but that ‘real witchcraft’undoubtedly existed in Europe, and that many witches had ‘intercourse’ withspirits they believed to be demons. We have also considered many cases ofAfrican witchcraft in which the sorcery undoubtedly worked, and even one inwhich a Catholic priest vouched that a man changed himself into a cassowary.In cases of vampirism, it seems a reasonable assumption that the vampire is a‘hungry ghost’ or earthbound spirit; in cases of lycanthropy, it seems clearthat individuals with a taste for sorcery or witchcraft have attempted to invokespirits in order to change into a wolf. In effect, such individuals wereinviting the spirits to possess them.And, as in the case of vampirism, there seem to be powerful sexual undertones.In discussing werewolves in The Occult, I have pointed out that many modern sexkillers—for example, the child-murderer Albert Fish and the necrophile EdGein—have behaved very much like the traditional idea of the werewolf. If Fishand Gein had been ‘witches’, it is easy to imagine them performing rituals toinvoke spirits until they genuinely felt they had been transformed into beastsof prey. But how far would this cause actual physical changes? In the Gandilloncase, we note that the 16-year-old victim, Benoit Bidel, said that the ‘wolf hadhuman hands, while in the Gamier case, Gamier confessed to strangling a youngboy. And peasants who interupted Gamier as he was attacking a 10-year-old girlsaid they thought they recognised his face. It certainly sounds as if the ‘wolfremained in many respects human—rather like the upright beast into which LonChaney is transformed in the film of The Wolf Man.In his classic work Man into Wolf, the Jungian psychologist Robert Eislersuggests that early man had to transform himself from a herbivorous ape into acarnivore struggling for supremacy with other carnivores, and that in the courseof this battle, he deliberately acquired something of the ferocity of the wildanimal. In his novel Steppenwolf, Hermann Hesse writes of a quiet, scholarly manwho likes to imagine himself transformed into a wolf of the steppes, and whowrites in a poem about attacking a girl:The lovely creature I would so treasure,And feast myself deep on her tender thigh,I would drink of her red blood full measure,Then howl till the night went by.We should also bear in mind Allen Kardec’s remark that spirits are able to‘possess’ those whose affinities they share, and that many sex killers—from the19th century American mass murderer H. H. Holmes to Peter Sutcliffe, theYorkshire Ripper—have believed themselves possessed by the Devil. Is it notconceivable that lychanthropy, like vampirism, should be understood as a specialcase of ‘demoniacal possession’?As we have seen in the chapter on witchcraft, the occult tradition recognisesanother type of spirit, the nature spirit or ‘elemental’—the psychic GeoffreyHodson described the ‘huge, crimson, bat-like thing’ that he saw in the LakeDistrict.Like the vampire and the werewolf, the elemental can be found in all mythologiesof the world. The name obviously implies that such entities are connected withthe ‘four elements’ of the ancient philosophers—earth, air, fire andwater—(respectively gnomes, sylphs, salamanders and undines). And since we nowknow that there are ninety-two natural elements, it would seem that we can atleast dismiss this notion without fear of being accused of scientificmaterialism.On the other hand, the Cambridge don Tom Lethbridge (whom we met in an earlierchapter; see Pp. 210 [../Text/12_chapter07.html#page_210]ff) was convinced thatthere was some scientific foundation for the belief in elementals. WhenLethbridge was eighteen, he and his mother had gone for a walk in the Great Woodnear Wokingham, and, at a certain spot, had both experienced a sense of deepdepression. A few days later they heard that the body of a suicide had beendiscovered a short distance from where they were standing.Forty two years later, after he had retired to an old house in Devon, Lethbridgeand his wife Mina went out one Sunday afternoon to collect seaweed for thegarden from nearby Ladram Bay. It was a grey, damp day in January, and almost assoon as they walked on to the beach, both felt as if they had ‘stepped into akind of blanket, or fog, of depression and . . . fear.’ Mina came hurrying backfrom the other end of the beach, saying: ‘I can’t stand this place any longer.There’s something frightful here.’The following Sunday they returned to Ladram beach. Again they encountered thesame ‘fog of depression’ at the same place. He noted that it was close to a spotwhere a tiny stream ran down from the cliff. When they went to the spot whereMina had experienced the depression the previous week, it was overwhelming, ‘sostrong as to make me feel almost giddy’. He likened it to being in bed with ahigh temperature when one is full of drugs. They went to the cliff top and Tombegan to make a sketch while Mina wandered off. As she stood on the edge of thecliff, she experienced a sensation as if someone was urging her to jump.Back at home, Tom thought he saw a clue. Lethbridge was an excellent dowser, sogood that he often used it in his archaeological work. On one occasion, as anexperiment, he had allowed a friend to blindfold him then lead him over groundthat contained volcanic dykes; his dowsing-rod had located every one of them.Dowsing, he was convinced, was some kind of response to the electrical field ofwater. (If he had known about split-brain physiology, he might have carried hisspeculations further and suggested that it is the right hemisphere thatresponds.) But suppose this ‘field’ could record emotions? Lethbridge was not,apparently, aware of Sir Oliver Lodge’s ‘tape recording’ theory of ghosts (seepage 211 [../Text/12_chapter07.html#page_211]), but the theory he came toformulate was in many ways similar: that when strong emotions occur in certainplaces, they are somehow recorded, and can be ‘picked up’ later by someone whois sensitive to such things. This, he thought, explained the feeling ofdepression in the Great Wood; the emotions of the man who had committed suicidelingered like a bad smell.In the case of Mina’s urge to jump from the cliff, Lethbridge speculated thatsomeone had intended to commit suicide by jumping from the same spot, and thatshe was somehow responding to the ‘recording’ of his depression. At this stage,Lethbridge did not assume that the man had actually jumped; he might have gonehome, had a large whisky, and felt better. But he discovered later that a manhad, in fact, committed suicide from the place where Mina was standing.In his book Ghost and Divining Rod, Lethbridge speculates on how the classicalbelief in nymphs came about. Suppose a youth sits down on the bank of a stream,and falls into a vivid sexual daydream in which he imagines a girl, unaware ofhis presence, taking off her clothes and bathing. His excitement is so strongthat his mental image of the naked girl is ‘recorded’ on the electrostatic fieldof the water. Some time later, a casual passer-by, thinking of nothing inparticular (and therefore in a receptive state), catches a glimpse of a nakedgirl in the stream, and a moment later, she vanishes. He naturally supposes thatshe is a supernatural being who has made herself invisible when she sensed thatshe was being watched . . . Lethbridge coined the name ‘naiad field’ for the‘recording’ medium of the water.The Great Wood near Wokingham was not particularly damp, and this led Lethbridgeto suggest that woods possess their own kind of electrical field, for which hecoined the term ‘dryad field’, after the Greek word for a wood nymph. He went onthe suggest that open places—like moors or deserts—and mountainous areas mighthave their own type of electrostatic field, and that this could account forsimilar tales of ‘spectral beings’ seen there. Lethbridge coined the word‘ghouls’ for the kind of unpleasant feeling he experienced in the Great Wood,and applied the word ‘ghost’ to actual appearances—like the man in hunting kithe had seen in his friend’s rooms in Cambridge.But even Lethbridge had to admit that his neat scientific theory of ‘elementalfields’ failed to explain some of his own experiences. In 1924 he had visitedthe island of Skellig Michael off the coast of Kerry. He had climbed a hill tolook at the ruins of an 8th-century monastery when he noted a heap of rubbishhalfway down the cliff face. As he made his way down towards it, he wasovertaken by an odd conviction that someone wanted to push him over the cliff,and the feeling was so strong that he changed his mind and went back. Accordingto his later theory, he had experienced a ‘ghoul’ like the one that made Minafeel she ought to jump from the cliff. But shortly afterwards, as he walked downthe hill in front of the monastery, he experienced a sensation that there wassomeone behind him, and he was suddenly flung flat on his face by a blow. Whenhe sat up, he was alone on the hillside. Clearly, this was not a ‘ghoul’, a taperecording of negative emotions. A telegraph operator on the mainland told himthat the lighthouse on the island had been haunted since a shipwreck. ButLethbridge thought that whatever had knocked him on his face was some kind ofpoltergeist.In Ghost and Ghoul (where he tells the story), Lethbridge goes on to speculateabout the nature of the poltergeist. He discusses the notion that poltergeiststake their energy from disturbed adolescents, and adds that ‘many still thinkthat the mind of the individual concerned is linked with that of some sub-humanpersonality’. But he then goes on to talk about psychokinesis, and ends bysuggesting that his experience on Skellig Michael could be explained in terms ofsome person who saw the shipwreck, and whose shock had created some kind ofdelayed psychokinetic effect. He fails to explain where the ‘poltergeist’ hadobtained the energy to knock him down. Or rather, he throws off casually thesuggestion that the energy was somehow connected with the ancient religioussite.We are in a position to recognise that Lethbridge was closer to the truth whenhe suggested that the poltergeist is ‘some sub-human personality’. His‘elemental field’ hypothesis is a bold and interesting attempt to create ascientific theory that can explain ‘ghosts and ghouls’. But Lethbridge lackedthe actual experience of poltergeists that led Guy Playfair to recognise that,in many cases at least, they are ‘spirits’. If he had, he would have recognisedthat his ‘tape recording’ theory of ghosts simply fails to cover the facts.Elsewhere in Ghost and Ghoul, Lethbridge goes on the discuss the most familiartype of elemental known to folklore, the ‘sith’ or fairy, and he records withamusement that a Scotsman of his acquaintance, an old boatman named John M.Robertson, was a firm believer in the sith. When Lethbridge and some Cambridgefriends were on the Shiant Islands, in the Hebrides, one them placed his coatand his lunch beside a rock on a hilltop. When he went back, they had vanished.The rest of the party laughed and said that a gull had probably taken them. Butwhile a gull might well help itself to someone’s lunch, it would certainlyignore a coat. His friend was so certain that no one could have taken themwithout being seen that he declared they had been removed by some supernaturalagency. John M. Robertson agreed, declaring that the sith were the culprits.Lethbridge’s later experience on Skellig Michael led him to wonder whetherRobertson might not be closer to the truth than the sceptical young men fromCambridge, and that his friend’s coat might have been taken by some kind ofpoltergeist, like the one that knocked him down on Skellig Michael. But heremained adamant that the fairies described to him by various Scottish and Irishcountrymen were some form of ‘mental projection’—a euphemism for hallucination.Three decades earlier, the poet W.B.Yeats had arrived at a different conclusion.Yeats’s early poems are full of fairies, but at the time Yeats was convincedthat this was wishful thinking. What changed his mind was a collaboration withhis friend—and patroness—Lady Augusta Gregory. In the summer of 1897, Yeats hadbeen staying with Lady Gregory at her home, Coole Park, and the two of thembegan collecting fairy stories from the local peasantry. Yeats’s acquaintancewith the extraordinary Madame Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society,had already convinced him of the existence of ‘spirits’. Now the sheerfactuality of so many descriptions of fairies—many of them eye-witnessaccounts—convinced him that they could not be dismissed as products of the ‘folkimagination’.G.K. Chesterton, who met Yeats a few years later, was impressed by hisinsistence on the factual reality of fairies. ‘He was the real originalrationalist who said that the fairies stand to reason. He staggered thematerialists by attacking their abstract materialism with a completely concretemysticism: ‘Imagination!’ he would say with withering contempt: ‘There wasn’tmuch imagination when Farmer Hogan was dragged out of bed and thrashed like asack of potatoes—that they did, they had ‘um out;’ the Irish accent warming withscorn; ‘they had ‘um out and thumped ‘um; and that’s not the sort of thing thata man wants to imagine.”Chesterton goes on to make a point of basic importance: ‘It is the fact that itis not abnormal men like artists, but normal men like peasants, who have bornewitness a thousand times to such things; it is the farmers who see the fairies.It is the agricultural labourer who calls a spade a spade who also calls aspirit a spirit; it is the woodcutter with no axe to grind . . . who will say hesaw a man hang on the gallows, and afterwards hang round it as a ghost.’A few years later, Yeats was to encourage the orientalist W.Y.Evans Wentz—bestknown for his translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead—to study the folkloreof the fairies: the result was Wentz’s first book The Fairy Faith in CelticCountries (1911), a bulky and scholarly volume, based upon his own extensivefieldwork. Yeats’s friend, the poet ‘AE’ (George Russell) contributed ananonymous piece to the book (under the title ‘An Irish Mystic’s Testimony’) inwhich he describes his own fairy sightings with the factuality and precision ofan anthropologist describing primitive tribes: shining beings, opalescentbeings, water beings, wood beings, lower elementals . . . ‘The first of [thefairies] I saw I remember very clearly . . . there was first a dazzle of light,and then I saw that this came from the heart of a tall figure with a bodyapparently shaped out of half-transparent or opalescent air, and throughout thebody ran a radiant electrical fire, to which the heart seemed the centre. Aroundthe head of this being and through its waving luminous hair, which was blown allabout the body like living strands of gold, there appeared flaming wing-likeauras. From the being itself light seemed to stream outwards in every direction;and the effect left on me after the vision was one of extraordinary lightness,joyousness or ecstasy.’Wentz concludes that the factual and scientific evidence for the existence offairies is overwhelming. ‘There are hundreds of proven cases of phenomena . . .’But AE’s fairies were essentially ‘visions’, and could therefore be classifiedwith unicorns or centaurs. Nine years after Wentz’s book appeared, the Britishpublic was intrigued to learn of new scientific evidence which seemed to placebelief in ‘the little people’ on an altogether more solid foundation.The story began on a Saturday afternoon in July 1917, when an engineer namedArthur Wright, went into the dark room to develop a photograph taken earlier inthe day by his 16-year-old daughter Elsie. As the plate began to develop, Wrightsaw vague white shapes appearing—he took them for birds. But when the picturebecame clear, he was startled to see that they were fairies. The picture showeda serious-faced little girl—Elsie’s cousin Frances Griffiths, aged 11—standingbehind a bush, her chin propped on her hand. And in front of her, dancing on topof the bush, were four neat little female figures with wings and diaphanousgarments, one of them playing a pan-pipe. ‘What on earth are they?’ said ArthurWright to his daughter, who was standing behind him. ‘Fairies,’ she said,matter-of-factly.Now working-class Yorkshiremen tend to be phlegmatic and down-to-earth. ArthurWright did not press his daughter for explanations; he merely grunted, andawaited further developments. They came a month later, when the girls againborrowed his camera. Elsie and Frances scrambled across the deep stream —or‘beck’—that ran at the bottom of the garden, and went to the old oaks in thedell beyond. And when Arthur Wright later developed the plate, it showed Elsiesitting on the grass, holding her hand out to a gnome who was apparently aboutto step up on to her dress.This time, Arthur and his wife Polly looked through the bedroom of the girls,hoping to find cut-out pictures that would explain the photographs. They foundnothing. Arthur Wright became mildly exasperated when both girls insisted therehad been no trickery—that there really were fairies at the bottom of theirgarden. He told Elsie she couldn’t use the camera again until she told him thetruth.In November 1917, Frances wrote a letter to a friend in South Africa enclosingone of the photographs, and remarking casually that it ‘is me with some fairiesup the beck . . .’These events took place in the village of Cottingley, in Yorkshire, on the roadfrom Bradford to Bingley. It has long since ceased to be a separate village, andhas become a part of the urban sprawl; but the Fairy Dell still exists.In the summer of 1919, Polly Wright, Elsie’s mother, went to a meeting of theTheosophical Society in Bradford. She was interested in ‘the occult’, having hadexperiences of astral projection and memories of past lives. The lecture thatevening was on fairies—for it is the position of the Theosophical Society thatfairies are simply a type of ‘elemental spirit’—nature spirits—that can manifestthemselves to people with second sight or ‘clairvoyance’. Naturally, Mrs Wrightcould not resist mentioning her daughter’s ‘fairy photographs’ to the personsitting next to her. As a result, Arthur Wright made prints of the twophotographs, and they were passed from hand to hand at the Theosophists’conference at Harrogate a few weeks later, and finally made their way to London,and into the hands of Edward Gardner, who was the president of the London branchof the Theosophical Society. Gardner was familiar with faked photographs ofghosts and spirits, and decided that these looked doubtful. He asked hiscorrespondent if he could let him see the negatives. When these arrived a fewdays later, Gardner was surprised to find no evidence of double exposure orother cheating. He took the negatives to a photography expert named Snelling,who examined them carefully under a powerful lens, and announced that it wasundoubtedly not a double exposure. Nor were the dancing fairies made of paper,or painted on to a sheet of glass. They had moved during the exposure. A weeklater, after enlarging the photographs, Snelling announced that, in his opinion,they were not faked. They were ordinary open-air shots.It so happened that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, hadagreed to write an article on fairies for the Christmas number of the StrandMagazine (in which Holmes first appeared). When he heard about the photographs,he contacted Gardner and asked if he could see them. The two men met, and agreedthat the pictures were too good to be true—the waterfall in the background(which looked like a painted backcloth), the highly appropriate toadstools . . .Gardner agreed to go to Cottingley to see the girls, and to find out whetherthey were hoaxers. Mr and Mrs Wright were startled to hear that the expertsthought the photographs genuine. And Gardner was startled when he walked up theglen with Elsie, and saw the scene exactly as she had photographed it, completewith waterfall and toadstools—although without fairies.Gardner decided to test the girls. Two cameras were bought, and the film-plateswere sealed so they could not be tampered with. In due course, the negativeswere returned to Gardner, and the factory that had produced them verified thatthey were still sealed, One showed Frances with a fairy leaping close to herface, another showed a fairy offering a flower to Elsie, while the third showedtwo fairies in the middle of a bush. In the centre of the picture there is anobject that looks rather like a bathing costume hung on a line. Elsie apparentlyhad no idea what this was; but Gardner, with his wider knowledge of fairy lore,identified it as a ‘magnetic bath’ which fairies weave in dull weather. (It hadrained continually that August.)Once more, the experts got to work to try to discover if the photographs hadbeen faked; again, they concluded that they were genuine. That Christmas,Doyle’s article on the fairies appeared in the Strand Magazine and caused asensation. Inevitably, the majority of people thought it was a hoax; yet noexpert on photography was able to say anything conclusive about how it mighthave been done. A reporter on the Westminster Gazette learned the trueidentities of the girls (Conan Doyle had used pseudonyms to protect them frompublicity) and went to see them. He concluded that everyone seemed honest andgenuine, and there was no evidence of trickery. Arthur Wright was baffled by itall, and deeply disappointed that Conan Doyle was naive enough to be taken in,‘bamboozled by our Elsie, and her at the bottom of her class’. Conan Doyle washimself puzzled and critical; yet he could not discount the possibility thatthese were real fairies, nature spirits of some kind. He contacted a wellknownclairvoyant named Geoffrey Hodson, and Hodson went to Cottingley, talked to thegirls, and went to the dell with them. He also saw fairy forms. We have metHodson in connection with a ‘bat-like’ elemental.)By the end of 1921, most people had lost interest in the fairies. Conan Doylewas to write a book about the case, called The Coming of the Fairies, which cameout in 1922; but there was no re-investigation.In 1965, Elsie, then in her 60s, was tracked down in the Midlands by a DailyExpress reporter Peter Chambers. His own conviction was that the pictures werefaked; and Elsie’s comment that people should be left to make up their own mindson the subject only deepened his scepticism. Elsie made the curious remark:‘As for the photographs, let’s say they are pictures of figments of ourimagination, Frances’ and mine, and leave it at that.’In 1971, Elsie was asked by the BBC’s Nationwide programme, if her father hadhad a hand in the taking of the photographs; she replied: ‘I would swear on theBible that father didn’t know what was going on.’ But when asked if she wouldswear on a Bible that the photograph were not tricks, she replied after a pause:‘I’d rather leave that open if you don’t mind . . . but my father had nothing todo with it, I can promise you that.’ Again she seemed to be coming close toadmitting that there was some kind of fraud.On the other hand when Frances was asked by Yorkshire Television if thephotographs were fabricated, she replied: ‘Of course not. You tell us how shecould do it—remember she was 16 and I was 10. Now then, as a child of 10, canyou go through life and keep a secret?’This, it seemed was the chief argument in favour of the fairy photographs; thatit seemed unlikely that Francis and Elsie would and could keep such a secret forso long.Frances made this comment in 1976; the occasion was a television programme aboutFrances and Elsie, which had been suggested by the Yorkshire psychicalinvestigator Joe Cooper. Which is why, on September 10, the two women turned upat a house on Main Street, Cottingley, opposite the house where the Wrightfamily had lived half a century earlier. During that time, Elsie had lived inIndia with her husband Frank Hill, a Scots engineer; Frances had married asoldier, Frank Way, and had spent much time with him abroad.Joe Cooper describes Frances as ‘a bespectacled woman of middle class and heightwearing fashionable denim clothes but with a dash of red and black about thescarf and blouse’. Elsie, when she arrived, looked a good ten years younger thanher 75 summers, dressed in fashionable slacks and ‘mod’ gear, with a blackbillycock hat. During the day Cooper became friendly with the two women, evencarrying Elsie over a stile. The camera team interviewed locals—who allexpressed extreme scepticism about the photographs—and filmed the women down bythe beck. Interviewer Austin Mitchell made no secret of believing that the caseof the Cottingley fairies had started as a joke, then got out of hand. Cooperwas inclined to believe them. On camera, Elsie and Frances identified the placewhere they had seen a gnome, and flatly denied that they had fabricated thephotographs. ‘Of course not!’ said Frances. And interviewed by Mitchell, JoeCooper stated his view that the girls had seen an ‘elemental form of fairylife’—that is to say, nature spirits. After all, W. B. Yeats and thousands ofhis fellow countrymen were quite certain about the existence of fairies . . .In 1977, there was an interesting development. A researcher named Fred Gettings,working on 19th century fairy illustrations, came upon Princess Mary’s GiftBook, published during the First World War to make money for the ‘Work forWomen’ fund. It contained a poem called ‘A Spell for a Fairy’ by Alfred Noyes,and this was illustrated by Claude Shepperson. And two of the fairies in hisillustration were virtually identical with the fairies in the first Cottingleyphotograph, showing Frances looking over the heads of five prancing fairies.Their positions had merely been reversed.In August 1978, The New Scientist reported that the magician James Randi (‘TheAmazing Randi’) and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims ofthe Paranormal (CSICOP) had put the photographs through an image-enhancementprocess, and found that this revealed strings holding up the fairies. When JoeCooper told Elsie about the article, she merely laughed and pointed out thatthere was nowhere in the region of the beck where string could be strung. Aftera TV play about the fairies had been broadcast in October 1978, Randi expressedindignation that the BBC had failed to state clearly that the photographs hadbeen proved to be fakes.In 1981, Joe Cooper was writing a book on telepathy, and had some correspondencewith Frances—who now lived in Ramsgate—about it. In September 1981, she askedhim to go to see her, telling him that there were ‘some things he should know’.When he arrived, she was still not ready to specify what these were. But thefollowing day, she asked him to drive her to Canterbury; once there, she askedhim to wait for her while she went into the cathedral. When she returned, theysat in a coffee bar, and she asked him what he thought of the first fairyphotograph. He commented that it has been greatly touched up. Then Francesdropped her bombshell:‘From where I was, I could see the hatpins holding up the figures. I’ve alwaysmarvelled that anybody ever took it seriously.’‘Why are you telling me?’ asked the flabbergasted investigator.‘Because Elsie has already told Glenn’—(Glenn was Elsie’s son).‘What about the other four? Are they fakes?’Her answer was, in its way, as astonishing as the original admission.‘Three of them. The last one’s genuine.’Cooper and Frances now discussed writing a book together, and giving Elsie ashare of the proceeds; Frances was adamant that Elsie should play no part inwriting the book. Cooper went to London to talk to his publisher. Unfortunately,the publisher was not particularly interested in a 60-year-old story aboutfairies, particularly since it ended so anticlimactically.The present writer had also got involved. I had met Joe Cooper at a weekendconference on parapsychology (at the Swanwick Conference Centre in Derbyshire)in 1980, and he told me he had written a book on the Cottingley fairies—this, ofcourse, was a year before Frances told him the true story. He sent me thetypescript, and I found it fascinating. I had also come across people whoclaimed to have seen fairies—one of them a hard-headed Scottish TVinterviewer—and I was simply not willing to rule out the possibility that‘Nature spirits’ might exist. Joe’s own researches into the paranormal hadconvinced him that ‘elementals’ could not simply be ruled out as an absurdity.In fact, I was on my way to Yorkshire to research the ‘Black Monk of Pontefact’(see Appendix [../Text/22_appendix.html]), an investigation that led me—as Ishall describe—to accept the notion that poltergeists are ‘spirits’, and notsimply a form of RSPK (recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis). So it was hardlylogical for me to deny the existence of ‘Nature spirits’ on the grounds thatonly a child could believe in them.But even in its original version, the problem with Joe Cooper’s book wasobviously that the story was too slight—it could be told in fifty pages. Therest had to be some kind of ‘padding’. And since, at that point, both Francesand Elsie were still insisting that the photographs were genuine, there was noreal conclusion. I tried to find a publisher for the book, but was unsuccessful.And at this point, Joe said he wanted to rewrite it anyway; and there the matterrested.It was in the following year that Frances finally ‘came clean’. Oddly enough,Joe was excited that the case had finally reached a definite conclusion. When hetold me about Frances’s confession, I was less optimistic. If the book endedwith Frances’s confession, it would be a damp squib.Joe Cooper came to the same conclusion. Late in 1982, a partwork called TheUnexplained, on which I was a consultant editor, published his article:‘Cottingley: At Last the Truth’, in which he revealed that the fairies in thefirst four photographs were cut-outs stuck to the branches with hatpins.Understandably, this upset both Frances and Elsie. When Frances called Joe’swife on New Year’s Day, 1983, and Joe answered the phone, she called him atraitor and hung up. She died in 1986. Elsie died in 1988, maintaining to theend that she did not believe in fairies.Which seems to be the end of the story. Or is it? Certainly the sceptics arejustified in regarding the case as closed. Possibly they are correct. Yet beforewe make up our minds, there is a great deal more to be said.What Frances is asking us to believe is this. She came to England from SouthAfrica in 1917, when she was ten, and went to stay with her 16-year-old cousinElsie in Cottingley. Elsie had always been fascinated by fairies, and claimed tohave had some odd ghostly experiences—she insisted that when she was 4 she wasregularly visited in bed by a woman in a tight dress buttoned up to her neck.And when she was 6, she woke up one night and called for a drink. When no onereplied, she went downstairs, and found a strange man and woman in the house.She asked where her parents were, and was told they had gone out to play cardswith the neighbours. When Elsie said she wanted to go and find them, the manopened the front door for her. Her parents—who were, in fact, playing cards withthe neighbours—were greatly alarmed to hear about the man and woman, for theyhad left the house empty. But when they went to investigate, the house wasempty.Frances had had no ‘psychic’ experiences. But in the spring of 1918, she saw herfirst gnome. She had gone down to the beck after school when she noticed aphenomenon she had often observed before: a single willow leaf began to shake onthe tree by the stream. Then a small man, all dressed in green, was standing onthe branch. Frances watched, breathless, terrified of disturbing him. Then thelittle man looked straight at her, and disappeared. After that, she claimed, sheoften saw little men wearing coats of greyish green and matching caps by thebeck. She gradually reached the conclusion that the little men were engaged insome kind of purposeful activity, perhaps associated with helping plants togrow. Later, she began to see fairies, with and without wings; these weresmaller than the elves, with white faces and arms, and often seemed to beholding some kind of meeting. Elsie, she insists, never saw the fairies orlittle men.It was after falling in the stream yet again that Frances admitted that she wentto the beck to see fairies. And it was the total scepticism of the adults thatled Elsie to decide to take some fairy photographs. This was not a simple desireto deceive. Elsie believed Frances when she said she saw fairies; her ownpsychic experiences made it quite plausible. She wanted to shake the credulityof the grown-ups. So the photographs were taken with cut-outs propped up byhatpins.When the world suddenly became interested in their fairies, they were in adifficult position. The photographs were fakes, but the fairies really existed.If the whole thing had been a hoax, it would have been easier to confess. But itwas not a hoax—not totally, anyway. They were in an embarrassing and anomalousposition. If they admitted that the photographs were fakes, they would beimplying that the whole affair was nothing but a hoax. And that would be untrueas continuing to maintain the the photographs were genuine. So they kept silent.When the whole affair blew up again in 1965, the situation was more or lessunchanged. Elsie, now a hard-headed woman in her 60s, was no longer so convincedthat Frances had seen fairies; yet she was absolutely certain that she had had‘psychic’ experiences, and was therefore prepared to be open-minded. As toFrances, she had seen fairies and had nothing to retract. In a letter to LeslieGardner, the son of Edward Gardner, Elsie remarked that after her interview withPeter Chambers (in 1965), in which she had declared that people must judge forthemselves, and that the pictures were of ‘figments of our imaginations’,Frances had said indignantly: ‘What did you say that for? You know very wellthat they were real.’Frances had always maintained that the fairies were real. In November 1918 shesent the first fairy photograph to a friend in South Africa, and scrawled on theback: ‘Elsie and I are very friendly with the beck Fairies. It’s funny I neverused to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.’In his original typescript of the Cottingley book, Joe Cooper had included achapter called ‘Other Sightings’, consisting of accounts of fairies related tohim by other people, and it makes clear why he believed Frances. One man, ahealer, told how he was sitting with a girl in Gibraltar, eating a sandwich,when it was snatched from him by ‘a little man about eighteen inches high’. An80-year-old officer of the Theosophical Society insisted that when he was asmall boy, he was often visited in bed by a green-clad gnome. Another old mandescribed seeing a green-clad gnome, about two feet high, walking along a pathin a cornfield. Some young male students told how, when walking in a wood nearBradford, they saw fairies who were ‘circling and dancing’, but who wereinvisible to the direct gaze: they could only be seen ‘out of the corner of theeye’. An elderly lady showed Cooper a photograph of a gnome seen through afrosty window; she claimed that she had come down one morning, seen the gnome,and rushed upstairs to get her camera. The photograph also shows diminutivewhite rabbits.In his book Modern Psychic Experiences, Joe Cooper publishes most of theseaccounts, together with many more. A New Zealand medium named Dorothy describedhow she used to play with a ‘spirit’ girl called Mabel as a child, and how shehad first seen fairies, who came from under plants. One day she came home tofind her father unconscious on the floor—a gastric ulcer had perforated—and thefairies took charge and escorted her to the door of the doctor. Joe Cooper’s ownniece Jo, in her thirties, described how, at the age of 16, she had seen threesmall men crouching on top of a wall.When I wrote about the Cottingley fairies in Poltergeist, I also went to sometrouble to find accounts of ‘real fairies’. I describe being interviewed ontelevision at the 1978 Edinburgh Festival by a man called Bobbie (whose surnameI forgot to note in my journal): in the pub next door he told me casually thatthe had once seen a gnome standing on the pavement outside a convent gate, andthat it had ‘scared the hell out of him.’My friend Marc Alexander, author of many books on the paranormal, told me astory of a friend in New Zealand called Pat Andrew, who claimed to have seen apixie when he was 6. Years later, after seeing a stage hypnotist, Marc and PatAndrew began experimenting with hypnosis on one another. Marc had no doubt thatPat Andrew was genuinely hypnotised, and one day decided to try and ‘regress’him to the age at which he saw the pixie. The result was an amazing one-sidedconversation that left Marc in no doubt whatever that, whether Andrew had reallyseen a pixie or not, he undoubtedly believed he had.One of the most circumstantial accounts I know of an encounter with a pixie isrecounted by another friend, Lois Bourne, in her book Witch Among Us. Lois is a‘witch’ in the sense of possessing odd psychic powers, of whose reality I havenot the slightest doubt. She is an extremely sensible and down-to-earth lady.And in her book, among many stories that psychical researchers will findcredible enough, she tells a story that will obviously cause most readers todoubt her truthfulness. Staying on holiday at a cottage at Crantock, inCornwall, she met another member of a ‘wicca’ coven, and spent an evening at herhome. The woman’s husband, Rob, asked her if she would like to see a goblin. Oneappeared among the rushes of the millstream at Treago Mill, Cuberts Heath, everymorning at sunrise, and if she wanted to see him, she had to be up early. Thenext morning Lois and her husband Wilfred joined Rob at the mill gate, and theycrept up to the stream. ‘I have never been able to decide, and still cannotdecide, whether I really saw that goblin, or if Rob made me see it . . .Whatever it was, there, sitting on a stone calmly washing his socks, was anelfin creature with a red hat, green coat and trews, one yellow sock on, and onein his tiny hands in the process of being washed. I remember thinking at thetime in my sleepy befuddled but practical way ‘what an atrocious colourcombination’. Suddenly he saw us and he disappeared . . . ‘Now do you believeme?’ asked Rob.’I have known Lois for years. I may be gullible and she may be a liar, but Ibelieve her. She is not the type to invent such a silly story. And her husbandWilfred—who also saw it—is not the type to support a downright lie.As already mentioned, the poet W. B. Yeats had been convinced of the existenceof fairies ever since he and Lady Gregory went from door to door collectinginformation from the local peasants. They recorded these interviews in a bookcalled Visions and Beliefs in 1920. Evans Wentz concludes his Fairy Faith inCeltic Countries by acknowledging: ‘we seem to have arrived at a point . . .where we can postulate scientifically . . . the existence of such invisibleintelligences as gods, genii, daemons, all kinds of true fairies, anddisembodied man . . .’ (By the latter he means ghosts). And he goes on to citethe very sound evidence for the existence of the poltergeist. George Russell(AE)—and Wentz—emphasise that these entities are seen only by ‘psychics’, andRussell believes that such beings are not ‘individuals’ in the human sense.‘Theirs is a collective life, so unindividualised and so calm that I might havemore varied thoughts in five hours than they would have in five years.’When all this is taken into account, we may feel that the notion that Francesreally saw fairies by the beck in Cottingley no longer seems quite so absurd. 1.

He comments again and again on the fact that so many Christian churchesare built on ancient pagan sites, and on that curious directive issued by PopeGregory the Great that where possible, Christian churches should be built inthese places. It could be, of course, that he was simply trying to recruitconverts who happened to be attached to the ‘Old Religion’ of the witches. Butthere was almost certainly a second reason: that he recognised that certainplaces were chosen because the ground itself was ‘sacred. Stonehenge is anexample; so is the Cornish circle of standing stones known as the Merry Maidens.In both these places, Lethbridge’s dowsing-rod detected powerful forces. When heplaced his hand on a stone at the Merry Maidens, while he was using a dowsingpendulum with the other hand (a pendulum can be more sensitive than adowsing-rod), he experienced a tingling force, not unlike an electric shock. Hetheorised that ancient priests had recognised this force in the earth, and hadordered the stones to be placed there to conduct the force—rather as anacupuncturist places the needles at the crossing points of certain ‘meridians’in the body.It is a pity that Lethbridge was unaware of the work of his predecessor AlfredWatkins, a Hereford brewer who had also been intrigued by ‘sacred places’. Halfa century earlier, on June 30, 1921, Watkins was riding his horse across thehills near Bredwardine, and as he paused on a hilltop, he noticed something thatexcited him. He could see a number of straight tracks and ancient footpathsrunning across the countyside, and he now observed that they seemed to connectup old churches, standing stones and ancient mounds (known as tumps or tumuli).It struck him that what he was looking at was ancient man’s equivalent of atelecommunications system. Some of these tracks, he thought, were simply traderoutes, while others must have some religious significance, since they connectedsacred sites. He decided to call them ‘ley lines’, from the old word for anenclosed field.It is, in fact, fairly easy to create a straight line that runs for miles acrosscountry, even if it has to go up hill and down dale. The technique is known as‘ranging a line’, and it requires only three staves. The man constructing thepath drives the first staff into the ground, and then closes one eye and looksbeyond it to the hilltop—or whichever point he wishes to go towards. Anassistant then places a second staff in line with the first. The third staff isplaced further along still, in such a position that it is blotted out by thesecond. Then the first staff is pulled up, and the process continues.The men who originally marked out these ‘old straight tracks’ were—Watkinsthought—probably of priestly rank, and would carry a staff as a badge of office.This may explain the great hillside figure called the Long Man of Wilmington,who seems to be holding a long staff in either hand . . .Watkins’s suggestion led to the formation of an ‘Old Straight Track’ club, whosemembers spent their weekends looking for new ley lines.One of its members made an interesting and puzzling observation in the late1930s—that, very often, two tracks ran parallel. But why should there be twotracks—like railway lines—when one would suffice? A retired solicitor named GuyUnderwood found what he thought was the answer. He spent his retirement dowsingaround stone circles, and he noticed that his dowsing-rod often showed twoparallel tracks of some underground force running for miles. And when heexamined ‘holy sites’—like Stonehenge—he found many of these ‘double’ tracks(named by him ‘aquastats’). They seemed to be lines of some kind of magneticforce.Watkins had never suspected that his straight tracks were anything but traderoutes or tracks between churches. Now Underwood was suggesting that theyfollowed lines of underground force. Moreover, at sacred sites, he found thatthese lines often formed a spiral. Ancient rock carvings all over the worlddisplay the same spiral pattern. Could this be because it is the obvious symbolfor this sacred earth force?In the 1960s—when the ‘occult revival’ was in full swing—another student ofancient monuments, John Michell, revived Watkins’ now forgotten ‘ley lines’.Oddly enough—or perhaps not so oddly, as it turned out—Michell began as astudent of the strange phenomenon known as flying saucers or UFOs. These hadleapt to international prominence in the late 1940s, after a businessman namedKenneth Arnold, flying his private aeroplane near Mount Rainier, in WashingtonState on June 24, 1947, had sighted nine shining disc-like objects flying in Vformation. Other sightings poured in, and in Kentucky in January 1948, CaptainThomas Mantell, piloting a Mustang, tried to follow a ‘flying saucer’ to twentythousand feet and fell out of the sky. From then on, there were thousands of UFOsightings, and books about them poured off the presses—to the disgust oforthodox scientists, who regarded it all as mass hysteria.What John Michell noted was that many of the places where flying saucers werereported were also ‘places of ancient sanctity’, and that in many cases theirflight path seemed to follow ley lines. This led Michell to re-examine theevidence of Watkins and Underwood. He also noticed that in Ireland ley lines arecalled ‘fairy paths’, and have been known since time immemorial. His views werefirst propounded in a book called The Flying Saucer Vision (1967), and then, twoyears later, in A View Over Atlantis. It suggested that the religions of ancientman were based upon a recognition of the magnetic forces of the earth, whichwere closely connected with its fertility. Ancient man, he believed, had his ownform of non-technological civilisation based upon these sacred forces.Glastonbury was one of the sites of this ancient religion.But why Atlantis? The Atlantis of legend was an ancient civilisation describedby Plato, an enormous island in the Atlantic ocean which had been swallowed upby some gigantic catastrophe nine thousand years earlier. Scholars had dismissedit as a myth, although one modern archaeologist, Professor A.G. Galanopoulos,had suggested that Atlantis was really the island of Santorini, north of Crete,which had been destroyed in a gigantic volcanic explosion about 1500 BC;Galanopoulos thought that the Egyptian priests from whom Plato got the story hadaccidentally multiplied all their figures by ten, including the date of thecatastrophe. What Michell was suggesting is that the story of Atlantis indicatesthat there had been a complex civilisation long before those that are known tohistory, and that folk memories of this civilisation survive in legends of the‘Golden Age’. Primitive religions were an interaction between man and nature, aninteraction that modern man has totally forgotten.One effect of Michell’s book was to turn Glastonbury into a place of pilgrimagefor hippies; another was to create a new interest in ley lines and ‘earthmagic’.Lethbridge, living quietly in Devon, knew none of this. Yet his own studies hadbrought him remarkably close to the same ideas. He had noticed, to begin with,how often churches called after St Michael are found along the lines that joinsacred places. This, he believed, was because the Christians had taken overpagan sites, and replaced the Celtic god Lugh (or Lucifer), the sun god andlight-bringer, with Lucifer’s traditional enemy St Michael.Lethbridge’s interest in St Michael and in the standing stones that so oftenseemed to be associated with him (or with the sun god) led him to wonder aboutanother ancient mystery: the legends of the great ‘war in heaven’ between StMichael and the ‘dragon’. Was it possible that this was also something more thana primitive myth?Lethbridge began from the same question that had intrigued John Michell: whywere there legends of a ‘golden age’? What made men of the bronze or ironage—who were, after all, so much better off than their forefathers – look backnostalgically to some idyllic past?He was also fascinated by the passage in the sixth chapter of Genesis about thesons of God finding the daughters of men desirable, and fathering children onthem. It adds that ‘there were giants in the earth in those days’, and that thedaughters of men bore children to them. And, since he was so interested in thequestion of St Michael and his enemy the dragon, he wondered about the passagein Revelation 12 about a ‘war in heaven’, when Michael and his angels foughtagainst the dragon.The solution that suggested itself to him struck him as so preposterous that hedelayed publishing it for a long time. It was that the ‘sons of God’ werevisitors from space, and that the ‘war in heaven’ had actually taken place, andthat an atomic bombardment accounted for the heavy cratering of Mars and themoon. As to the standing stones—like Stonehenge and the Merry Maidens: was itnot possible that they might have served as ‘beacons’ for the space craft tohome in on?In short, what Lethbridge suggests is that the ‘golden age’—Michell’sAtlantis—was an age in the remote past when visitors from space had landed onearth and taught human beings a great deal about the use of technology. Theresult was a diffusion of this knowledge over the surface of the earth, whichaccounted for the similarity of artifacts found all over the world.Because Lethbridge was such a loner, he was unaware that he had simply tuned into the ‘spirit of the age’, and was raising questions that had occurred to otherspeculative thinkers. Lethbridge was, in fact, devastated to discover justbefore his death that his ‘space men’ idea had been suggested by the Swisswriter Erich von Daniken, in a book called Memories of the Future (1967) andtranslated as Chariots of the Gods?, which suggested that all kinds of ancientartifacts and monuments—including the Great Pyramid—were the work of space men.In fact, as early as 1958, a writer named George Hunt Williamson had written abook called Secret Places of the Lion, in which he declared that visitors fromspace had landed eighteen million years ago, and had dedicated themselves sincethen to the evolution of mankind. Pauwels and Bergier repeated the suggestion intheir Morning of the Magicians (1960). The same idea was given popular currencyin 1968 in Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001: A Space Odyssey.If Lethbridge had had time to study Daniken more carefully, he would have feltless chagrined. Although Daniken achieved international best-sellerdom with hisbooks on ‘space visitors’, scholarly analysis revealed that most of his ideaswere simply absurd guesses or distortions of fact. Chariots of the Gods?describes how, in the Assyrian Epic of Gilgamesh, there is an episode in whichthe hero Enkidu is borne upward in the claws of the sun god, so that his bodyfeels as heavy as lead; he then flies for four hours in the talons of an eagle.These episodes, Daniken suggests, are really accounts of a trip in a spacecraft. A door that speaks with a human voice is obviously a loudspeaker . . . Infact, a careful perusal of the Epic of Gilgamesh reveals that these events donot occur.Von Daniken also suggests that the Great Pyramid must have been built by ancientastronauts because rope was not known in Egypt at the time it was built; infact, many tomb paintings depict men using ropes. (Von Daniken also manages tomultiply the weight of the pyramid by five.) He insists that the statues onEaster Island must have been built by space men, because carving them and movingthem was beyond the technology of the Easter Island natives; but modern EasterIslanders disproved that by carving and erecting a statue for the benefit of theexplorer Thor Heyerdahl. The lines drawn on the flat surface of the desert inPeru—known as the Nazca lines—were, according to Daniken, intended as landingstrips for space ships; he ignores the obvious fact that the turbulence createdby any large craft would destroy the lines, which have remained unchanged since500 AD only because the desert is windless.In a later book, Gold of the Gods, Daniken indulges in actual deceit. Hedescribes in detail how he descended into a vast underground cave system inEcuador, and examined an ancient library of strange metal leaves engraved withunknown characters. Later exploration of the caves revealed no such library, andwhen Daniken’s companion revealed that Daniken had not even venturedunderground, Daniken himself admitted that this was true, but explained that thewriters of books like Gold of the Gods are permitted to embroider their facts.The result of all this is that Daniken has now been totally discredited, andthat the ‘ancient astronaut’ theory associated with his name has few serioussupporters. This is a pity, for there is far more convincing evidence than thatpresented by Daniken. An impeccably scholarly book, The Sirius Mystery by RobertTemple, examines the question of how an African tribe called the Dogon came toknow that Sirius is a double star, (since this can only be perceived through anastronomical telescope), and that its companion (Sirius B) is a white dwarf—a‘collapsed’ star of tremendous density, which rotates on its axis and revolvesaround Sirius A every fifty years. Temple argues that the Dogon derived theirknowledge from ancient Egyptians, who in turn must have learnt it from ‘spacevisitors’. Opponents of the theory have argued that early white missionaries mayhave brought astronomical knowledge to the Dogon, but there is not the slightestscrap of evidence for this. The Dogon themselves insist that their knowledge ofthe Digitaria star (as they call it) is part of their ancient tradition.More interesting evidence can be found in another scholarly study, Maps of theAncient Sea Kings (1966), subtitled ‘Evidence of Advanced Civilisation in theIce Age’, by Professor Charles Hapgood. In 1956, a Turkish naval officerpresented a copy of an ancient map to the US Navy Hydrographic Society. Astudent of old maps, Captain Arlington Mallery, concluded that it showed theAntarctic coast of Queen Maud Land in the days before its bays were covered overby ice—about six thousand years ago. Hapgood decided to recruit his students atKeene State College into the project, and got them studying the Piri Reis maps:Piri Reis was not (as Pauwels and Bergier state) a 19th century naval officer,but a Turkish pirate of Greek nationality who was beheaded in 1554, and whoseseafaring maps had been preserved in the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. These alsoshowed Antarctic bays that have been frozen over for six thousand years; yetseafaring began only about 2,000 BC.The obvious conclusion seemed to be that a seafaring civilisation existed in4,000 BC. This, admittedly, is hardly proof of Lethbridge’s space visitors –perhaps men built ships two thousand years earlier than anyone suspected, at thetime the Sumerians were creating the earliest known civilisation in Mesopotamia(and, of course, before the birth of writing). What seems altogether odder isthe evidence of another map—the Hamy-King chart—which showed a land bridgeacross the Bering Straits which has not existed for twelve thousand years.Hapgood argued that all this seemed to show that a worldwide civilisation with apowerful navy probably existed twelve thousand years ago—at a time when,according to historians, the earth was inhabited only by primitive Stone Agehunters, and the earliest farmers had not yet appeared.All this naturally excited devotees of the legend of Atlantis, (not to mentionMu, a similar civilisation which was supposed to have existed in the Pacific inan earlier epoch). The publication of Daniken’s Chariots of the Gods in thefollowing year poured cold water on all this excitement, much as the birth ofSpiritualism had caused the eclipse of Buchanan’s psychometry; Hapgood foundhimself tarred with the same brush and labelled a crank. Yet republication ofhis book, in a revised edition, in 1979, left no doubt that his theory of anancient worldwide civilisation must be taken seriously.All this, of course, is still no proof of Lethbridge’s space men theory. In hisbook Timescale—a narrative ‘map’ of world history—Nigel Calder refers to ourCro-magnon ancestors, who replaced the more ape-like Neanderthal Man aroundthirty-four thousand years ago, as a ‘race of supermen, created by mutationsamong the highbrow subspecies living in warm regions’. This race of supermensurvived the last great Ice Age, starting twenty-eight thousand years ago, andwhen the thaw began, about fourteen thousand years ago, nothing seems morelikely than that they quickly learned to take advantage of the seas with theirteeming fish population. So it may be that we merely have to revise our notionsof history to accommodate the idea of a Stone Age civilisation with seagoingvessels. But it is far more difficult to believe that these Stone Age seafarerscreated complex maps—even if they scratched them on bark. Hapgood’s evidencesuggests that we may have to choose between the legend of Atlantis, and thenotion of ancient astronauts.In Legend of the Sons of God, Lethbridge is inclined to accept both. Atlantis,he thinks, may be a ‘garbled memory’ of the exploits of the Megalith builders.But he is also inclined to believe that flying saucers may also be the vehiclesin which the ‘sons of God’ originally came to earth. Lethbridge had seensomething that might have been a flying saucer in 1931—a shining disc like alarge balloon floating down towards the road. (Nicholas Roerich, who designedStravinky’s Rite of Spring ballet, saw one in 1926, when he and a party oftravellers were making their way across the Himalayas from Mongolia to India;this one behaved like the traditional flying saucer in moving at a great speedand then suddenly changing direction). After discussing flying saucers at somelength, he suggests that they could either be ‘space visitors’, or beings fromsome other dimension. (Lethbridge’s studies with the pendulum had convinced himof the reality of ‘other dimensions’1) But he is inclined to believe that thesolution to the mystery lies in what he calls ‘bio-electronics’, the study ofthe living forces of the earth, which ancient man seems to have understood sowell. Like John Michell, he believes that there is some connection between UFOsand the ‘magnetic’ forces of the earth. He also believes that there is aconnection between these magnetic forces and the human mind. He goes on tosuggest that ‘out of the body’ experiences are a proof of the human mind’sability to escape our earthly ‘vibration rate’ and move to a higher one. (Hisneighbour at Branscombe—the ‘witch’—convinced him of this by paying an ‘astral’visit to his bedroom one night, and later describing what she saw there.)Lethbridge died in September 1971, before publication of Legend of the Sons ofGod. What is clear from that book—and from his final posthumous work The Powerof the Pendulum—is that he was experiencing a problem that seems to haunt allinvestigators of the paranormal. They begin by studying some phenomenon thatpersonal experience led them to accept (as Buchanan’s experiences with hisstudents convinced him of the reality of psychometry), and they propound somebasically commonsense theory to explain it in scientific terms. Then moreevidence turns up that contradicts the theory—like Buchanan’s discovery thatpsychometry worked just as well on a newspaper photograph that had not been incontact with its original. The theory is then expanded slightly to try toaccommodate the problem—at which point some new anomaly makes its appearance . .. And so on, until it is clear that no purely rational theory can accommodateall the facts.Many who have decided to look into ‘flying saucers’ have encountered theproblem. One of these was an American journalist named John Keel, who hadprepared a radio documentary as early as 1952, and decided that the evidence forUFOs could not be dismissed.Like so many others, John Keel was also mildly sceptical about flying saucersuntil he tried the unusual expedient of studying the subject instead of passinga priori judgements. In 1952 he prepared a radio documentary on things seen inthe sky, and came to believe that—even then—there had been too many sightings offlying saucers to dismiss them as mistakes or lies. In 1953, in Egypt, he sawhis first UFO, a metallic disc with a revolving rim, hovering over the Aswan damin daylight. Yet even so, it was not until 1966 that he decided to undertake acareful study of the subject, and subscribed to a press-cutting bureau. Whatthen staggered him was the sheer number of the sightings—he often received 150clippings in a day. (In those days press clippings were only a few pence each;twenty years later, at about a pound each, the experiment would be beyond theresources of most journalists.) Moreover, it soon became clear that even thesewere only a small percentage of the total, and that thousands of sightings weregoing unrecorded. (This is in fact the chief disadvantage of a chapter like thisone; it cannot even begin to convey the sheer volume of the sightings. Anysceptic should try the experience of reading, say, a hundred cases, one afterthe other, to realize why the ‘delusion’ theory fails to hold water.) What alsofascinated Keel was that so many witnesses who had seen UFOs from their cars hadlater seen them over their homes; this suggested that the ‘space men’ were notmerely alien scientists or explorers, engaged in routine surveying work.In the following year, 1967, Keel was driving along the Long Island Expresswaywhen he saw a sphere of light in the sky, pursuing a course parallel to his own.When he reached Huntington he found that cars were parked along the roads, anddozens of people were staring at four lights that were bobbing and weaving inthe sky; the light that had followed Keel joined the other four. Keel was infact on his way to interview a scientist, Phillip Burckhardt, who had seen a UFOhovering above some trees close to his home on the previous evening, and hadexamined it through binoculars; he had seen that it was a silvery discilluminated by rectangular lights that blinked on and off. The nearby SuffolkAir Force Base seemed to know nothing about it.Keel was impressed by the witnesses he interviewed; most were ordinary peoplewho had no obvious reason for inventing a story about UFOs. His study of theactual literature convinced him that it was 98 per cent nonsense; but mostindividual witnesses were obviously telling the truth. Keel had soon accumulatedenough cases to fill a 2,000-page typescript; this had to be severely truncatedbefore it was published under the title UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse.As his investigation progressed, Keel became increasingly convinced that UFOshad been around for thousands of years, and that many biblical accounts of fierychariots or fireballs are probably descriptions of them. In 1883 a Mexicanastronomer named Jose Bonilla photographed 143 circular objects that movedacross the solar disc. In 1878 a Texas farmer named John Martin saw a largecircular object flying overhead, and actually used the word ‘saucer’ in anewspaper interview about it. In 1897 people all over American began sightinghuge airships—cigar-shaped craft. (This was before the man-made airship had beeninvented.) Dozens of other early. ‘UFO’ sightings have been chronicled innewspaper reports or pamphlets; Chapter 26 of Charles Fort’s Book of theDamned—written thirty years before the UFO craze—is devoted to strange objectsand lights seen in the sky.Keel was also interested by the parallels between reports of ‘space men’ anddescriptions by people who claim to have had supernatural experiences. The‘angel’ that instructed Joseph Smith—founder of the Mormons—to go and dig forengraved gold tablets sounds very like the kind of space visitor described byAdamski and so many others. During the First World War three children playing inmeadows near Fatima, Portugal, saw a shining globe of light, and a woman’s voicespoke from it. (Only two of the three heard it, although all saw it, suggestingthat it was in their minds rather than in the objective world.) Crowds began tovisit the spot every month where the ‘Lady of the Rosary’ (as she calledherself) appeared to the three children—only the children were able to see andhear her. But on October 13, 1917, when the Lacy had announced that she wouldprovide a miracle to convince tie world, the rainclouds parted, and a hugesilver disc descended towards the crowd of seventy thousand people. It whirledand bobbed—exactly like the UFOs Keel had seen- and changed colour through thewhole spectrum; all watched it for ten minutes before it vanished into theclouds again. Many other people in the area saw it from their homes. The heatfrom the ‘object’ dried the wet clothes of the crowd. Keel cites this and other‘miracles’ (such as one that occurred in Heede, Germany), and argues that theysound curiously similar to later UFO accounts.There also seemed to be a more sinister aspect to the UFO affair: witnessesbegan to report that ‘government officials’ had called on them and warned themto be silent; these men were usually dressed in black, although sometimes theywore military uniforms. No government department had—apparently—ever heard ofthem. Albert K.Bencer of Bridgeport, Connecticut, suddenly closed down hisInternational Flying Saucer Bureau in 1953, and declared that three dark-skinnedmen with glowing eyes had pressured him into abandoning his researches. Most UFOenthusiasts blamed the government; but when Bender published his full accountten years later it was obvious that something much stranger was involved; thethree men materialised and dematerialised in his apartment, and on one occasionhad transported him to a UFO base in A???arctica. Jacques Vallee, anotherscientist who had become interested in the UFO phenomenon, noted the similaritybetween this story and medieval legends about fairies and ‘elementals’.When Keel began to investigate sightings in West Virginia of a huge winged manwho seemed to be able to keep up with fast-moving cars, he himself began toencounter vaguely hostile entities. A photographer took his picture in an emptystreet, then ran away. Just after arranging to meet another UFO expert, GrayBarker, a friend revealed that she had been told about the meeting two days ago-before Keel had even thought of it. ‘Contactees’ would ring him up and explainthat they were with someone who wished to speak to him; then he would haveconversations with men who spoke in strange voices. (He sometimes got thefeeling he was speaking to someone in a trance.) Keel would be instructed towrite letters to addresses which upon investigation proved to be non-existent;yet he would receive prompt replies, written in block letters. On one occasion,he stayed at a motel chosen at random, and found a message waiting for him atthe desk. He says (in The Mothman Prophecies): ‘Someone somewhere was justtrying to prove that they knew every move I was making, listened to all my phonecalls, and could even control my mail. And they were succeeding.’ The entitiesalso made many predictions of the assassination of Martin Luther King, of aplanned attack on Robert Kennedy, of an attempt to stab the pope; but theyfrequently seemed to get the dates wrong. Keel concluded that ‘our little planetseems to be experiencing the interpenetration of forces or entities from someother space-time continuum’.But this is enough to remind us that, according to Kardec, this has beenhappening throughout human history. Stone Age shamans performed their magicritual dances to enlist the aid of the spirits in hunting game. Bronze Agepriests performed their religious ceremonies to ensure a good harvest. Devoteesof the witch-goddess Aradia performed their nature rituals to enlist the aid ofthe moon goddess to aid the poor against the rich. Mediaeval witches invoked theDevil to make their spells effective. Upper-class Frenchwomen in the age ofNapoleon indulged in ‘table turning’—and later in automatic writing—tointerrogate the denizens of the spirit world . . . And fifty years later,Spiritualists learned to ‘contact the dead’ through the agency of mediums. It isarguable that they were all doing much the same thing—achieving contact withvarious bodiless entities who may or may not be what they claim to be.In the light of this recognition, we can begin to understand the strangeexperiences of a contemporary scientist, Dr Andrija Puharich, who has also beendrawn into the bewildering world of the paranormal. Puharich started life as anerve specialist who became interested in the phenomenon of telepathy—apparentlythe most innocuous and scientifically explainable of all paranormal phenomena.He began a series of experiments with the well-known medium Eileen Garrett, whowas placed in a Faraday cage (an electrified cage) to test whether telepathy issome kind of electromagnetic radiation like radio waves. Apparently it was not:Mrs Garrett was able to tell Puharich that his friend Henry Wallace wanted toreach him urgently while she was in the Faraday cage. Minutes later, Puharich’ssecretary came in to tell him that Henry Wallace was on the telephone.Puharich’s book Beyond Telepathy (1974) was to become a classic ofparapsychology.Now Puharich became interested in a young Dutch sculptor named Harry Stone, who,when examining an ancient Egyptian pendant, fell into a trance and began drawinghieroglyphics. An expert on Egyptology confirmed them to be genuinehieroglyphics of the period of the Pharaoh Snofru. They identified the writer asa scribe called Ra Ho Tep, who mentioned that his wife was called Nefert; bothidentifications proved to be historically correct. Puharich watched withfascination as Stone went into a trance and wrote out messages in ancientEgyptian—and learned from them of a ‘cult of the sacred mushroom’, of whichhistorians had never heard. Another acquaintance also fell into a trance,identified herself as someone born in ancient Syria, and also spoke of the cultof the mushroom called amanita muscaria, which was claimed to cause ‘out of thebody experiences’. Puharich had his one-and-only such experience during theinvestigation. Ra Ho Tep demanded a sacred mushroom while Stone was in trance,and applied it ritualistically to his tongue and the top of his head. In asubsequent ESP test, Stone scored 100 per cent, and was able to see through abrick wall.Soon after this, a Hindu scholar, Dr D.G. Vinod, went into a trance whilevisiting Puharich, and speaking in a deep, sonorous voice quite unlike his ownhigh pitched tones, identified himself as M, a representative of ‘theNine’—short for Nine Principles and Forces, superintelligences whose purpose wasto help the human race. If Puharich had known anything about the history ofwitchcraft and Spiritualism, he would probably have told M to get lost. As itwas, he felt highly privileged and awaited further developments, which were notslow in coming. Vinod relayed more messages from the Nine, and materialised aball of cotton; and a couple named Laughead, whom Puharich had met by chance,also delivered messages from the Nine which were consistent with previous ones,convincing Puharich of the genuineness of the space people . . .Next Puharich investigated a Brazilian ‘psychic surgeon’ called Arigo, andwatched him performing delicate operations with a kitchen knife, cutting openpatients, removing tumours with his hands, then sealing the incision by pressingits edges together with his fingers. But when Puharich was informed of Arigo’sdeath in a car crash—by telephone—he learned that he had received the messagebefore Arigo crashed.In 1971, Puharich heard about a young Israeli psychic named Uri Geller, andhurried off to Tel Aviv to meet him. He watched Geller perform successful featsof mind reading, saw him break a ring which a woman held in her clenched fistmerely by placing his own hand above it, and bend spoons by gently rubbing themwith his finger. One day, Geller fell into a trance and told Puharich how, atthe age of 3, he had fallen asleep in a garden, and been awakened by a spacecraft which had knocked him down with a beam of light. Then a strange metallicvoice, speaking from the air above Geller’s head, informed Puharich that it wasa ‘space being’ who had programmed Geller at the age of three, and that itspurpose was to help Geller avert an immensely destructive war. The same ‘spaceman’ later identified himself as one of the Nine. Whenever these beingscommunicated, they caused the tape recording to dematerialise.The strange series of events that followed are described in detail in Puharich’sbook Uri: A Journal of the Mystery of Uri Geller, yet are so bewildering andpreposterous that they caused the book to be received with extreme hostility.The Nine stopped cars and started them again, made UFOs appear overhead,‘teleported’ various objects (and even Geller himself), and performed so manyother bizarre miracles that the reader is finally left in a state of punch-drunkindifference. (When I met Puharich, he told me that he had deliberately left outsome of the more preposterous events for fear of creating incredulity; when hedescribed some of them to me, I saw his point.) The book, which the publishershad expected to become a bestseller, was a flop.Geller and Puharich parted; Geller grew tired of being subjected to endlesstests. But the ‘space intelligences’ were apparently enjoying themselves toomuch to allow Puharich to get back to science. When Puharich went to investigatea medium named Bobby Horne in Florida, they lost no time in re-establishingcontact, and telling him that his purpose now was to prepare mankind for a masslanding of space ships on planet earth during the next year or two. Anothermedium, Phyllis Schlemmer, also began relaying messages from the spaceintelligences. (One of the space beings, a man called Tom, explained that thefirst civilisation on earth was founded by space visitors in the Tarim Basin inChina thirty-two thousand years ago.) Stuart Holroyd, an English writer whobecame involved with the group, subsequently wrote a book called Prelude to aLanding on Planet Earth which describes the amazing goings-on that followed.They are too bewildering to describe in detail: what happened basically was thatPuharich, Holroyd, Phyllis Schlemmer and another Englishman named Sir JohnWhitmore rushed around the Middle East, holding seances in hotel rooms andpraying for peace; Tom periodically assured them that they had justsaved-mankind. By 1975, the landing on planet earth had failed to materialise,and Holroyd settled down to writing his book. His own theory is that theunconscious minds of the people involved were responsible. He cites a curiouswork called From India to the Planet Mars, in which a French psychologist,Theodore Flournoy, investigated the mediumship of an attractive girl namedCatherine Muller, who described her past incarnation as the wife of a prince in15th century India, and the civilisation of the planet Mars. The Indianincarnation is convincing; she appeared to know all kinds of details about 15thcentury India, and the prince to whom she was married, Sivrouka Nakaya, provedto be a real historical personage. But the Martian details—which many acceptedas genuine—were finally disproved in 1976 when a Viking spacecraft finallylanded on Mars and revealed it to be an airless desert.The unconscious deception hypothesis would be more convincing if CatherineMuller had not displayed genuine psychic powers—for example, she could readFlournoy’s mind, and various ‘apports’ appeared while she was in trance,including Chinese artifacts and roses and violets (in midwinter). As it is, itis difficult to avoid the conclusion that Flournoy, like Catherine Muller, wasthe victim of the astral confidence tricksters that Joe Fisher has called‘hungry ghosts’. And the same explanation seems to cover the weird eventsdescribed in Prelude to a Landing on Planet Earth.But perhaps the best example of the problems encountered by unwary investigatorsof the paranormal is furnished by the career of the late F.W.Holiday, anaturalist whose modest aim was merely to establish (or disprove) the existenceof the Loch Ness monster. Sightings of the monster—a kind of long-neckeddinosaur—began in 1933, soon after the completion of a road along the northernshore of Loch Ness, Britain’s largest and deepest lake. A couple saw it surgingacross the loch, and another couple saw it on land—a strange grey creature witha long neck like a serpent. It was even photographed later the same year. In1961, an engineer named Tim Dinsdale took a cine-film of the monster swimmingacross the loch. In the following year, Holiday stood beside the loch on a clearmorning and saw a black, glistening shape like a hippopotamus rise out of thewater, then dive below the surface; he estimated it at about 45 feet long.Holiday saw it twice more, and wrote a book called The Great Orm of Loch Ness(1968), arguing that it was a kind of giant slug. But Holiday was much intriguedto learn that Boleskine House, on the southern shore of the loch, had beentenanted by Aleister Crowley, and that Crowley had performed rituals to summonup ‘spirits’. He began to entertain a cautious suspicion that the ‘monster’ hadbeen conjured up by Crowley, This was not as absurd as it sounds. After his LochNess investigations, Holiday went to Ireland to try to photograph lake monstersseen in a number of loughs (the Irish version of lochs) in Galway. The reportsof sightings by various witnesses were totally convincing; yet what puzzledHoliday was that the loughs were obviously too small to support a large mammal.This led him to wonder whether the ‘peiste’ (as the Irish call the monsters) isa creature of flesh and blood, or some kind of Jungian ‘projection’ (i.e.illusion) of the racial unconscious. Jung had formulated this theory to explainUFOs (although he later came to accept that they were objectively real), andHoliday had also experienced UFO sightings.And now, slowly, Holiday was coming around to the view that lake monsters arenot simply ‘prehistoric survivals’—that they may be somethng altogether moreelusive. In the Middle Ages, ‘orms’ (or ‘worms’) and dragons had been associatedwith evil, and he had been struck by the number of witnesses who had experienceda sense of horror on seeing lake monsters. Could the Loch Ness monster be somekind of phantom?By 1971 Holiday had abandoned the notion that the lake monsters are simply‘prehistoric survivals’. He was coming round to the admittedly eccentric viewthat there is some influence at work that actively prevents the final solutionof the mystery, just as in the case of Unidentified Flying Objects. And sometime in 1972 this view seemed to be confirmed when he read a newspapercontroversy between an ‘exorcist’, the Rev. Donald Omand, and some opponent whothought the Loch Ness monster was simply an unidentified animal. Omand hadinherited ‘second sight’ from Highland ancestors, and had no doubt of the realexistence of powers of evil—or at least of mischief; he often performedexorcisms to get rid of them. He had caught his first glimpse of a lake monsterin Loch Long in Ross-shire in 1967. In June 1968, in a boat in Norway’s Fjord ofthe Trolls, he saw another, which came straight towards them; the Norwegiancaptain who was with him told him not to be afraid: ‘It will not hurt us—theynever do.’ And in fact the monster dived before it reached their boat. But theCaptain, Jan Andersen, was convinced that the monsters were basically evil, thatin some way they could do harm to men’s characters (or, as Omand would havesaid, their souls). In 1972 Omand attended a psychiatric conference at which aneminent Swedish psychiatrist read a paper on the monster of Lake Storsjön, andsaid that he was convinced that the monsters had a malevolent effect on humanbeings, especially those who hunted them or saw them regularly. He thought theirinfluence could cause domestic tragedies and moral degeneration. So Omand beganto consider the theory that perhaps lake monsters are not real creatures, but‘projections’ of something from the prehistoric past.Holiday wrote to Omand, and the odd result was that in June 1973 Holiday andDonald Omand rowed out into the middle of Loch Ness, and Omand performed anexorcism of the loch. Holiday said they both felt oddly exhausted when it wasover. And his suspicion that he was stirring up dangerous forces seemed to beconfirmed two days later when he went to stay the night with a retiredWing-Commander named Carey. Holiday was telling Mrs Carey about a Swedishjournalist called Jan-Ove Sundberg who had been wandering through the woodsbehind Foyers when he had seen a strange craft in a clearing, and someodd-looking men; the craft had taken off at a great speed, and after his returnto Sweden, Sundberg had been plagued by ‘men in black’—people claiming to beofficials who often seem to harass UFO ‘contactees’.Holiday said he intended to go and look at the place where the ‘UFO’ had landed,and Mrs Carey warned him against it. At this moment there was a rushing soundlike a tornado outside the window and a series of violent thuds; a beam of lightcame in through the window, and focused on Holiday’s forehead. A moment later,all was still. The odd thing was that Wing-Commander Carey, who had been pouringa drink only a few feet away from his wife, saw and heard nothing. The nextmorning, as Holiday was walking towards the loch, he saw a man dressed entirelyin black—including helmet and goggles—standing nearby; he walked past him,turned his head, and was astonished to find that the man had vanished. He rushedto the road and looked in both directions; there was nowhere the man could havegone. One year later, close to the same spot, Holiday had a heart attack; as hewas being carried away he looked over the side of the stretcher and saw thatthey were just passing the exact spot where he had seen the ‘man in black’. Fiveyears later, in 1978, Holiday died of a heart attack.Perhaps a year before his death, Ted Holiday sent me the typescript of his bookThe Goblin Universe, in which he attempted to justify the rather strange viewshe had gradually developed since starting his hunt for the Loch Ness monster. Hehad already discussed them in his second book The Dragon and the Disc, in whichhe linked UFOs (‘discs’) and ‘worms’ as symbols of good and evil. Then, to mysurprise, he changed his mind about publishing the book.There were, I suspect, two reasons. The team of investigators from the Academyof Applied Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, led by DrRobert H. Rines, had taken some remarkable underwater photographs in 1972 and1975; one of the 1972 photographs showed very clearly an object like a largeflipper, perhaps eight feet long, while a 1975 photograph showed very clearly along-necked creature and its front flipper; this was particularly impressivebecause the sonar evidence—waves of sound reflected back from the creature—madeit clear that this was not some freak of the light or piece of floating wreckageor lake-weed. By the time he was thinking about publishing The Goblin Universe,Holiday was probably wondering whether the book would be contradicted by somenew evidence that would establish the physical reality of the monster beyond alldoubt. Apart from this, the argument of The Goblin Universe was not quite asrigorous as it might be—he was attempting to explain why his views had changedso startlingly since 1962, and spent a great deal of time dwelling on ‘theparanormal’. At all events, he decided not to publish the book, and insteadwrote another typescript confined to lake monsters. I finally succeeded infinding a publisher for the book in England and America, and it has appeared inboth countries.The Goblin Universe will confirm sceptics in their view that any involvement inthe paranormal is likely to result in some mild form of insanity. Withoutapology, he states his conclusion that both lake monsters and UFOs are ‘psychic’phenomena—or, at least, have some psychic component—and that the same probablyapplies to such odd anomalies as phantom pumas, leopards, Bigfoots andAbominable Snowmen. It is an oddly frustrating book because he makes no attemptto advance some unifying theory that will explain these phenomena—although thereare times when he seems to hint that, like John Keel, he regards them as somekind of attempt to force human beings to abandon their dogmatism and widen theirmental horizons. Like so many investigators, Holiday has moved from the positionof open-minded sceptic to that of a thoroughly confused believer in theparanormal. There is no reason to believe that, if he had lived, he would havebecome any less bewildered.The confusion, of course, is due to his attempt to reconcile the endlesscontradictions that seem to arise in any serious attempt to interrogate theparanormal. We, at least, are in a slightly better position, since, like anyexperienced detective, we recognise that a large number of our suspects areincapable of telling the truth.The latest—and in some ways one of the most puzzling—manifestations of ‘thegoblin universe’ is the curious mystery of the ‘crop circles’.In early August, 1980, a Wiltshire farmer named John Scull was irritated to findthree flattened circular areas in one of his oatfields. It looked as if vandalshad stood in the centre, and swung around some heavy object on a long piece ofrope, flattening the oats to the ground in a clockwise direction. But if this ishow they were made, the vandal must have been a very tall and powerful man, forthe circles were sixty feet in diameter. And the fact that the surrounding oatsshowed no sign of trespassers made it unlikely that the circles had a humanorigin. The Wiltshire Times reported the incident on August 15, adding that thecircles were within the view of the famous White Horse of Westbury, the hillsidefigure cut into the chalk.Close study of the three circles established that they had been formed on threedifferent dates, probably over a period of months. One of the experts, anatmospheric physicist called Terence Meaden, stated that the likeliestexplanation was summer whirlwinds. But he admitted that it was odd that each‘whirlwind’ had remained stationary, instead of flattening a path through thecrops.On August 19 the following year—1981—three more circles appeared in a punchbowlformation below Cheesefoot Head, near Winchester in Hampshire. This time thepattern made whirlwinds seem unlikely. There was one central circle, about 60feet in diameter, and two smaller ones—about 25 feet across—placed neatly oneither side. Would a whirlwind ‘bounce’ three times?There were a few isolated reports of incidents in 1982, but they wereunspectacular, and excited little attention. As if to make up for it, a seriesof five-circle phenomena began in 1983, one of them again close to the WhiteHorse of Westbury. These made it clear that whirlwinds could not be theexplanation. A ‘bouncing’ whirlwind might make three circles in a line, butthese ‘fivesomes’ had a central circle, with the others placed neatly around itas if at four corners. ‘UFO’ enthusiasts had already noted that one of thegroups had appeared at the foot of Cley Hill, near Warminster, where there hadbeen dozens of UFO sightings. Now the ‘fivesomes’ began to excite the attentionof the national media.When another ‘fivesome’ close to the Westbury Horse proved to be a hoax, paidfor by the Daily Mirror, the sceptics said ‘I told you so’. But the man who haddetected the hoax was Bob Rickard, editor of an ‘anomaly’ magazine called theFortean Times. He noted the tell-tale signs of human intruders which had notbeen present in any of the original circles.From then on, circles began to multiply. The whirlwind theory remained the chiefstandby of the experts. As if to disprove this, the circles began to increase incomplexity. Anti-clockwise flattenings began to appear, and some of the circleshad a larger ring outside them—some as many as three rings. This was gettingpreposterous. At Oadby, near Leicester, three circles appeared in neat triangleformation around a larger ringed crop circle in 1988. On Charity Down, nearGoodwood Clatford (Hampshire), a remarkable ‘Celtic Cross’ appeared in August ofthe same year—a double circle with four symmetrical circles in its outer rim.When the circle expert, Dr Terence Meaden published a book explaining thecircles in terms of an ‘electromagnetic plasma vortex’, and pointing out thatsuccessive rings in ringed circles caused flattening in opposite directions, acircle that contradicted all his theories promptly appeared at Cheesefoot Head,reminding students of poltergeist phenomena that poltergeists often show thesame sensitivity to comments made about them. But when a group of UFOenthusiasts suggested that the circles were made by UFOs landing, another circlequickly appeared under a power cable, where a landing would have been virtuallyimpossible.Crop circle experts now called themselves ‘cereologists’, and they also noticedthat the phenomena seemed to respond to human ideas. An aerial photographernamed Busty Taylor was returning home from a day of photographing circles whenhe remarked that he would like to see one in the form of a Celtic Cross; thenext day, a Celtic Cross circle had appeared at the spot he was flying over atthe time.The circles went on becoming increasingly complex, ruling out most ‘natural’explanations. In 1990, an extraordinary pattern of six elaborate circles—in astraight line—appeared near Alton Barnes, in Hampshire, with a number ofkey-like objects sticking out of the sides of three circles, producing theeffect of ancient pictograms.There have been a number of eye-witness accounts of the formation of thecircles. Typical of these is one reported from Scotland in August 1989 by a MrSandy Reid. Meaden reports: ‘For half a minute as he watched, at a distance of15 metres, the wind was violently rustling the corn over a circular area, allthe time making a strange noise, but where he stood there was no wind at all.Then suddenly a ‘force’ shot downwards and a circle appeared almostinstantaneously. This was a good observation of the vortex-breakdown of astanding eddy vortex.’1Here are a number of other eye-witness descriptions, compiled by Bob Rickard:‘Suddenly the grass began to sway before our eyes and laid itself flat in aclockwise spiral . . . A perfect circle was completed in less than half aminute, all the time accompanied by a high-pitched humming sound . . . Myattention was drawn to a “wave” coming through the heads of the cereal crop in astraight line . . . The agency, though invisible, behaved like a solid object .. . When we reached the spot where the circles had been, we were suddenly caughtup in a terrific whirlwind . . . [The dog] went wild . . . There was a rushingsound and a rumble . . . then suddenly everything was still . . . It was uncanny. . . The dawn chorus stopped; the sky darkened . . .’All that seems clear at the time of writing (1991) is that the circles cannot beexplained in ‘natural’ terms, although it is still just conceivable that theymight have been made by some brilliant hoaxer flying a tiny helicopter. In abook called The Crop Circle Enigma (1990), an article by John Michell points outthat the phenomena bring to mind John Keel’s descriptions of his own experienceswith UFO phenomena—that ‘strange ideas and experiences force their way into thelives of all who enquire into such subjects’. ‘Like many other cereologists, andlike Keel, Shuttlewood and ufologists before them, they admit that their lives,minds and outlooks have been radically changed by their investigations.’ And headds the significant evalaluation: ‘On one level the change is philosophical;after honest appraisal of ufology and crop circle data, it is impossible tomaintain the rationalistic world-view on which modern science and education arefounded. One is led into unfamiliar channels of thought, which point away fromstructured theories and hard-and-fast beliefs towards a more mystical view ofreality and, eventually, towards the greater mysteries of divinity and theliving universe.’He goes on to elaborate:‘Reviewing the evidence in this field, Devereux was struck by an observationwhich repeatedly occurs in reports by witnesses to mysterious light phenomena,that their experience of reality is somehow affected. Some tell of visions andpsychic revelations, and a common feature is that witnesses feel aware of amental link between themselves and the phenomena. In his category of earthlights Devereux includes manifestations which are recognised by science, thoughnot fully explained or understood, such as will-o’-the-wisps and ball lightning.Such things certainly seem to be related to the earth’s energy field, but theirbehaviour is unpredictable, and they often give the impression of acting in anintelligent or purposeful way towards those who see them. Devereux’s conclusion,forced upon him by the overwhelming weight of evidence, is that the Earth’svital energies have a component of intelligence, similar to our own intelligenceand capable of interacting with it.’And he summarises:‘There is little doubt, especially as the astonishing events of 1990 continue tounfold, that the patterns in the corn have a meaning, and the meaning of suchthings is to be found in the way people are affected by them. Jung discerned themeaning of UFOs as agents and portents of changes in human thought patterns, andthat function has clearly been inherited by crop circles, which are acontinuation—a solidification, one might say—of the UFO phenomenon. We have seenearlier how exposure to the influence of crop circles has changed the attitudesand mentalities of many investigators. Such changes, if they are in accord withthe spirit of the times, are both permanent and contagious. Judging by what hashappened so far, there seems to be every justification for extending Jung’scharacterization of UFOs to crop circles, and thus for regarding them as signsof ‘great changes to come which are compatible with the end of an era’.’If Ted Holiday had lived for another decade, he would undoubtedly have changedhis mind about his decision not to publish The Goblin Universe. From the pointof view of the last decade of the 20th century, it seems more relevant thanever.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

Now, at the end, we must return to him.Pyotr Demianovitch Ouspensky was born in Moscow on March 5, 1878, the son of agovernment official and a talented artist, and his earliest experience ofmystery came from sudden flashes of the feeling: ‘I have been here before’,which began when he was six. When he discovered the writing of Nietzsche, heconcluded that his ‘I have been here before’ feeling was what Nietzsche’sZarathustra meant by ‘Eternal Recurrence’, the notion that human beings livetheir lives over and over again. And when, at the age of 18, he lost his mother,he decided to travel to foreign countries in search of the ‘hidden knowledge’which he was certain existed. His travels took him around Russia, Europe andIndia in search of ‘masters’ who could teach him the meaning of life. He wrote arather gloomy novel called The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin about a character whohas to keep on reliving his life. (To do Ouspensky justice, he did not believethat the repetition is identical; rather, our lives are like a play which has tofollow the script, but which the actor himself can turn into a triumph or aflop.)Back in Russia, he wrote a remarkable work called Tertium Organum (which wasquoted in the first chapter). This work was later to make him famous in thewest, for at the end of the First World War, it was read by a young Russian,Nicholas Bessarabov, who lived in America, and was published by a writer andarchitect called Claude Bragdon. It was an instant success, with the result thatBragdon tried to contact the author to send him his royalties. His letter caughtup with Ouspensky in Constantinople; Ouspensky had fled from the RussianRevolution and was virtually destitute when the money arrived. He asked Bragdonif he could help him to emigrate to England. A few weeks later, with the help ofanother Ouspensky admirer, Lady Rothermere—wife of the newspaper magnate—Bragdonwas able to send Ouspensky the money to travel to London. There he discoveredthat Tertium Organum had already gone into a second edition, and that a circleof admirers was waiting eagerly to learn what he had to teach them.What he had to teach them was—as we know from the twelfth chapter of thisbook—what Gurdjieff had taught him in Russia: that human consciousness is a formof sleep, and that our problem is to awaken. Ouspensky remained identified withthe teaching of Gurdjieff—who quickly became as well known in Europe asOuspensky himself—and is still generally labelled a ‘Gurdjieff disciple’. Thisis a major mistake. If Ouspensky had died after he had written Tertium Organum,he would still be recognised as a thinker of remarkable freshness andoriginality. And if he had died after he had written his second book, A NewModel of the Universe—still before he met Gurdjieff—he would be known as one ofthe most original thinkers of the 20th century. In a sense, his meeting withGurdjieff, which was the most important event of his life, was also a misfortunewhich prevented his own genius from being recognised.In fact, in 1910, soon after he returned from India, Ouspensky began a series of‘experiments’ in mysticism that brought him some of the profoundest insights ofhis life. They deserve to be regarded not merely as a watershed in Ouspensky’slife, but as a watershed in the history of human consciousness.It is a pity that Ouspensky refuses to go into the techniques he used forachieving ‘mystical’ states of consciousness. This, I suspect, is because he wasashamed of them. I believe he simply used the gas that dentists used to use forputting their patients to sleep: nitrous oxide. It was discovered in 1795 by ayoung chemist called Humphry Davy, who was heating a mixture of damp ironfilings and nitric acid, and, as he sniffed it, experienced a pleasant sensationof dizziness and a tremendous gaiety, so that he burst out laughing. Then helost consciousness. When he woke up he exclaimed: ‘What a wonderfuldiscovery—laughing gas.’The philosopher William James remarked: ‘Nitrous oxide and ether, especiallynitrous oxide, when sufficiently diluted with air, stimulate the mysticalconsciousness in an extraordinary degree. Depth beyond depth of truth seemrevealed to the inhaler. This truth fades out, however, or escapes, at themoment of coming to; and if any words remain over in which it seemed to clotheitself, they prove to be the veriest nonsense. Nevertheless, the sense ofprofound meaning having been there persists; and I know more than one person whois persuaded that in the nitrous oxide trance we have a genuine metaphysicalrevelation.’1Ouspensky had also undergone training in yoga, and it may be that this was whyhe was able to cling on to so much of the revelation, instead of losing it as hereturned to consciousness.Significantly, Ouspensky mentions James’s remarks on mysticism and the use ofnarcotics at the beginning of his chapter ‘Experimental Mysticism’ in A NewModel of the Universe.What Ouspensky discovered was that as soon as he began the experiment, a changein his state of consciousness began to occur. The problem was that this stateoffered so much that was new and unexpected, and these insights flashed by soquickly, ‘that I could not find words . . . which would enable me to rememberwhat had occurred even for myself, still less to convey it to somebody else.’The first sensation, he says, was an odd sense of duality, as if he had becometwo people. This, I suspect, was an activation of both sides of the brain, sothat his ‘I’ became double. The right side had the mystical experience; the leftdid its best to observe and remember it.But now he makes his most important observation: that the problem in describingthis state is that everything is linked together. To describe something, we needa starting-point. Ouspensky found that ‘in order to describe the firstimpressions, the first sensations, it is necessary to describe all at once. Thenew world with which one comes into contact has no sides, so that it isimpossible to describe first one side and then the other. All of it is visibleat every point.’In other words, what he saw in this state is that everything is connected witheverything else, so that trying to describe it is like trying to pick up a heapof chain when you have no idea where to find its beginning . . .In fact, we are all familiar with this experience. When you listen to a piece ofmusic for the first time—particularly if it is a complex piece of music, like asymphony—you only ‘register’ small parts of it. The more often you hear it, themore these parts come together, until finally you have the whole work ‘in yourhead’. A young child listening to a symphony simply fails to understand it; itsounds like an incomprehensible jumble of notes. But when the child is oldenough to understand and enjoy the symphony, he still could not explain it tohis younger brother. He could only say: ‘Ah yes, now I see.’Ouspensky offers an example of the way in which he actually ‘saw’ theconnectedness:‘I remember once sitting on a sofa smoking and looking at an ashtray. It was anordinary copper ash-tray. Suddenly I felt that I was beginning to understandwhat the ash-tray was, and at the same time, with a certain wonder and almostwith fear, I felt that I had never understood it before and that we do notunderstand the simplest things around us.‘The ash-tray roused a whirlwind of thoughts and images. It contained such aninfinite number of facts, of events; it was linked with such an immense numberof things. First of all, with everything connected with smoking and tobacco.This at once roused thousands of images, pictures, memories. Then the ash-trayitself. How had it come into being? All the materials of which it could havebeen made? Copper, in this case—what was copper? How had people discovered itfor the first time? How had they learned to make use of it? How and where wasthe copper obtained from which this ash-tray was made? Through what kind oftreatment had it passed, how had it been transported from place to place, howmany people had worked on it or in connection with it? How had the copper beentransformed into an ash-tray? These and other questions about the history of theash-tray up to the day when it had appeared on my table.‘I remember writing a few words on a piece of paper in order to retain somethingof these thoughts on the following day. And next day I read:‘“A man can go mad from one ash-tray.”‘The meaning of all that I felt was that in one ash-tray it was possible to knowall. By invisible threads the ash-tray was connected with everything in theworld, not only with the present, but with all the past and with all the future.To know an ash-tray meant to know all.‘My description does not in the least express the sensation as it actually was,because the first and principal impression was that the ash-tray was alive, thatit thought, understood and told me all about itself. All I learned from theash-tray itself. The second impression was the extraordinary emotional characterof all connected with what I had learned about the ash-tray.‘“Everything is alive,” I said to myself in the midst of these observations;“there is nothing dead, it is only we who are dead. If we become alive for amoment, we shall feel that everything is alive, that all things live, think,feel and can speak to us.”’This sensation was intensified when he tried his ‘experiments’ when walking downthe street:‘On such occasions the whole of the ordinary world changed in a very subtle andstrange way. Everything became different, but it is absolutely impossible todescribe what happened to it. The first thing that can be said is that there wasnothing which remained indifferent for me. All taken together and each thingseparately affected me in one way or another. In other words, I took everythingemotionally, reacted to everything emotionally. Further, in this new world whichsurrounded me, there was nothing separate, nothing that had no connection withother things or with me personally. All things were connected with one another,and not accidentally, but by incomprehensible chains of causes and effects. Allthings were dependent on one another, all things lived in one another. Further,in this world there was nothing dead, nothing inanimate, nothing that did notthink, nothing that did not feel, nothing unconscious. Everything was living,everything was conscious of itself. Everything spoke to me and I could speak toeverything. Particularly interesting were the houses and other buildings which Ipassed, especially the old houses. They were living beings, full of thoughts,feelings, moods and memories. The people who lived in them were their thoughts,feelings, moods. I mean that the people in relation to the “houses” playedapproximately the same role which the different “I”s of our personality play inrelation to us. They come and go, sometimes live in us for a long time,sometimes appear only for short moments.‘I remember once being struck by an ordinary cab-horse in the Nevsky, by itshead, its face. It expressed the whole being of the horse. Looking at thehorse’s face I understood all that could be understood about a horse. All thetraits of horse-nature, all of which a horse is capable, all of which it isincapable, all that it can do, all that it cannot do; all this was expressed inthe lines and features of the horse’s face. A dog once gave me a similarsensation. At the same time the horse and the dog were not simply horse and dog;they were “atoms”, conscious, moving “atoms” of great beings—“the great horse”and “the great dog”. I understood then that we also are atoms of a great being,“the great man”. Each thing is an atom of a “great thing”. A glass is an atom ofa “great glass”. A fork is an atom of a “great fork”.’He records many other strange insights in his ‘mystical’ states, including onethat seems typical of their paradoxical nature:‘I will try to describe in short what I met with in this strange world in whichI saw myself.‘What I first noticed, simultaneously with the “division of myself into two”,was that the relation between the objective and the subjective was broken,entirely altered, and took certain forms incomprehensible to us. But “objective”and “subjective” are only words. I do not wish to hide behind these words, but Iwish to describe as exactly as possible what I really felt. For this purpose Imust explain what it is that I call “objective” and “subjective”. My hand, thepen with which I write, the table, these are objective phenomena. My thoughts,my mental images, the pictures of my imagination, these are subjectivephenomena. The world is divided for us along these lines when we are in ourordinary state of consciousness, and all our ordinary orientation works alongthe lines of this division. In the new state all this was completely upset.First of all we are accustomed to the constancy of the relation between thesubjective and the objective—what is objective is always objective, what issubjective is always subjective. Here I saw that the objective and thesubjective could change places. The one could become the other. It is verydifficult to express this. The habitual mistrust of the subjective disappeared;every thought, every feeling, every image, was immediately objectified in realsubstantial forms which differed in no way from the forms of objectivephenomena; and at the same time objective phenomena somehow disappeared, lostall reality, appeared entirely subjective, fictitious, invented, having no realexistence.‘This was the first experience. Further, in trying to describe this strangeworld in which I saw myself, I must say that it resembled more than anything aworld of very complicated mathematical relations.‘Imagine a world in which all relations of quantities, from the simplest to themost complicated, have a form.‘Certainly it is easy to say “imagine such a world”.‘I understand perfectly well that to “imagine” it is impossible. Yet at the sametime what I am saying is the closest approximation to the truth which can bemade.‘“A world of mathematical relations”—this means a world in which everything isconnected, in which nothing exists separately and in which at the same time therelations between things have a real existence apart from the things themselves;or, possibly, “things” do not even exist and only “relations” exist.’Equally fascinating is his observation that, in this state of intense excitement(he also mentions that he was seething with a sense of sheer joy and delight),time seemed to slow down. It became impossible to communicate with anyonebecause his mind was moving so much faster than his words:‘I tried my experiments under the most varied conditions and in the most variedsurroundings. Gradually I became convinced that it was best to be alone.Verification of the experiments, that is, observation by another person, or therecording of the experiences at the very moment they took place, was quiteimpossible. In any case I never obtained any results in this way.‘When I tried having someone near me during these experiments, I found that nokind of conversation could be carried on. I began to say something, but betweenthe first and second words of my sentence such an enormous number of ideasoccurred to me and passed before me, that the two words were so widely separatedas to make it impossible to find any connection between them. And the third wordI usually forgot before it was pronounced, and in trying to recall it I found amillion new ideas, but completely forgot where I had begun, I remember forinstance the beginning of a sentence:‘“I said yesterday” . . .‘No sooner had I pronounced the word “I” than a number of ideas began to turn inmy head about the meaning of the word, in a philosophical, in a psychologicaland in every other sense. This was all so important, so new and profound, thatwhen I pronounced the word “said”, I could not understand in the least what Imeant by it. Tearing myself away with difficulty from the first cycle ofthoughts about “I”, I passed to the idea “said”, and immediately found in it aninfinite content. The idea of speech, the possibility of expressing thoughts inwords, the past tense of the verb, each of these ideas produced an explosion ofthoughts, conjectures, comparisons and associations. Thus, when I pronounced theword “yesterday” I was already quite unable to understand why I had said it. Butit in its turn immediately dragged me into the depths of the problems of time,of past, present and future, and before me such possibilities of approach tothese problems began to open up that my breath was taken away.‘It was precisely these attempts at conversation, made in these strange statesof consciousness, which gave me the sensation of change in time which isdescribed by almost everyone who has made experiments like mine. This is afeeling of the extraordinary lengthening of time, in which seconds seem to beyears or decades.‘Nevertheless, the usual feeling of time did not disappear; only together withit or within it there appeared as it were another feeling of time, and twomoments of ordinary time, like two words of my sentence, could be separated bylong periods of another time.‘I remember how much I was struck by this sensation the first time I had it. Mycompanion was saying something. Between each sound of his voice, between eachmovement of his lips, long periods of time passed. When he had finished a shortsentence, the meaning of which did not reach me at all, I felt I had livedthrough so much during that time that we should never be able to understand oneanother again, that I had gone too far from him. It seemed to me that we werestill able to speak and to a certain extent understand one another at thebeginning of this sentence, but by the end it had become quite impossible,because there were no means of conveying to him all that I had lived through inbetween.’It is worth mentioning, at this point, the experiences of another ‘experimentalmystic’, R.H. Ward, the author of a remarkable work called A Drug-Taker’s Notes.The book is mainly devoted to his accounts of ‘controlled’ experiments with LSD;but, in an earlier chapter, he also describes an earlier experience under dentalgas—nitrous oxide:‘On this occasion it seemed to me that I passed, after the first few inhalationsof the gas, directly into a state of consciousness already far more completethan the fullest degree of ordinary waking consciousness, and that I then passedprogressively upwards (for there was an actual sensation of upward movement)into finer and finer degrees of this heightened awareness. But although one mustwrite of it in terms of time, time had no place in the experience. In one senseit lasted far longer than the short period between inhaling the gas and “cominground”, lasted indeed for an eternity, and in another sense it took no time atall. In terms of time, however, the first phase of the experience wascomparatively brief (though perhaps it would be more exact to say that it wascomparatively unimportant): a confusion of sensations in which, while I wasalready hardly aware of my body, I was still able to think in the ordinary way,and with some surprise that I was not being made unconscious by the gas I wasinhaling, but very much the reverse. For already I knew, I understood, Iactually was, far more than I normally knew, understood and was. I put it inthis way because I had no impression of suddenly receiving new knowledge,understanding and being. Rather I felt that I was rediscovering these things,which had once been mine, but which I had lost many years before. While it wasaltogether strange, this new condition was also familiar; it was even in somesense my rightful condition. Meanwhile, what was becoming unreal, slow andclumsy was the ordinary world which I was leaving behind, but of whose shadowyexistence I was still vaguely aware; indeed it presented itself to me as beinglike the receding shadow which fades across a landscape when the sun comes out.’Like Ouspensky, Ward records the sheer happiness of the experience, itsemotional richness:‘As for the emotional tone of this phase of the experience, I can only describeit as being compounded of wonder, joy, and a wholly peaceful inevitableness forwhich there is no name. This sensation, which yet had nothing to do with myalready anaesthetized senses, had an emotional depth which does not belong towaking sensation, and to which our waking word-values do not belong, so that itis all but indescribable. Meanwhile, the extraordinary feeling of the rightnessof things increased, became more poignant, and was accompanied as it did so by apeculiar sensation of upward and bodiless flight. This sense of upward movementcontinued until it seemed to me that I was rapidly passing through what Iafterwards told myself was a “region of ideas”. The emphasis had shifted, thatis to say, from the emotional to the intellectual.’It is clear that this ‘region of ideas’ corresponds to Ouspensky’s world ofmathematical relations. Ward compares it to Plato’s world of forms orideas—recalling Ouspensky’s comment that ‘a fork is an atom of a Great Fork’.Both Ouspensky and Ward describe the disappointment of returning to ordinaryconsciousness. This is Ward:‘Thereafter the upward flight became a downward flight; whereas one had riseninto the pure light of the sun, now one fell again towards the shadows of earth.I was once more aware of being in the “region of ideas”, and this time, asconsciousness diminished towards the consciousness of everyday life (or,paradoxically, as my anaesthetized body “regained consciousness”), the “regionof ideas” took form; on its nether fringes the symbols we need in the wakingstate if we are to comprehend “intuition” were supplied. In a flash, as itseemed to me, I saw the meaning; the meaning, that is, of the universe, of lifeon earth, and of man. As the darkness of what we flatter ourselves isconsciousness closed in upon me, and even as I began dimly to be aware that Iwas “coming to”, the sum of things appeared before my inward eyes as a livinggeometrical figure, an infinitely complicated and infinitely simple arrangementof continually moving, continually changing golden lines on a background ofdarkness. (“Geometry,” it has often been recorded, is a common form for suchvisions to take.)’ [We note here again the need to fall back on a mathematicalanalogy.]Ouspensky expresses an even stronger sense of rejection of ‘normalconsciousness’:‘The strangest thing in all these experiences was the coming back, the return tothe ordinary state, to the state which we call life. This was something verysimilar to dying or to what I thought dying must be.‘Usually this coming back occurred when I woke up in the morning after aninteresting experiment the night before. The experiments almost always ended insleep. During this sleep I evidently passed into the usual state and awoke inthe ordinary world, in the world in which we awake every morning. But this worldcontained something extraordinarily oppressive, it was incredibly empty,colourless and lifeless. It was as though everything in it was wooden, as if itwas an enormous wooden machine with creaking wooden wheels, wooden thoughts,wooden moods, wooden sensations; everything was terribly slow, scarcely moved,or moved with a melancholy wooden creaking. Everything was dead, soulless,feelingless.‘They were terrible, these moments of awakening in an unreal world after a realone, in a dead world after a living, in a limited world, cut into small pieces,after an infinite and entire world.’Ouspensky’s own vision of an ‘entire world’ had been oddly reminiscent of Ward’sliving geometrical figure:‘Once when I was in the state into which my experiments brought me, I askedmyself: “What is the world?”‘Immediately I saw a semblance of some big flower, like a rose or a lotus, thepetals of which were continually unfolding from the middle, growing, increasingin size, reaching the outside of the flower and then in some way again returningto the middle and starting again at the beginning. Words in no way express it.In this flower there was an incredible quantity of light, movement, colour,music, emotion, agitation, knowledge, intelligence, mathematics, and continuousunceasing growth. And while I was looking at this flower someone seemed toexplain to me that this was the “World” or “Brahma” in its clearest aspect andin the nearest possible approximation to what it is in reality—“If theapproximation were made still nearer, it would be Brahma himself, as he is,”said the voice.’The main difference between the two accounts is that Ward describes only‘mystical’ insights, while Ouspensky—no doubt because he repeated the experimentso often—also had certain experiences that are closer to some of the paranormalexperiences described in this book. He heard ‘voices’, and was able to ask themquestions. From the beginning he mistrusted the voices; but on at least oneoccasion, when he asked them a question about alchemy, they were able to tellhim the name of the book in which, in fact, he found the answer to his question(although, he adds, ‘not the complete answer’.)In these states, Ouspensky also found that he was able, to some extent, toforesee the future—or rather, that some inner voice was able to predict it.Thinking about going to Moscow that Easter, he was suddenly ‘told’ that he wouldnot be able to go, and he was able to foresee the chain of events that wouldprevent him from going. It was only just before Easter, when these events beganto happen—and prevented him from going to Moscow—that he remembered he had knownabout it in advance. In states of intensified consciousness—as Alan Vaughandiscovered—the mind is able to see future events.The sense of world-rejection experienced by both Ouspensky and Ward as theyreturned to ‘normality’ raises again one of the most basic of all questions:what might be called ‘the great Outsider question’. In Shaw’s John Bull’s OtherIsland, the mystic Father Keegan explains that he has discovered the answer tothe mystery of human suffering: this world is actually Hell, and we are all hereto expiate sins commited in some other existence. And for the epigraph of myfirst book, The Outsider, I had chosen another passage from the same play:Broadbent: . . . I find the world quite good enough for me—rather a jolly place,in fact.Keegan (looking at him with quiet wonder): You are satisfied?Broadbent: As a reasonable man, yes. I see no evils in the world—except ofcourse, natural evils—that cannot be remedied by freedom, self-government andEnglish institutions. I think so, not because I am an Englishman, but as amatter of common sense.Keegan: You feel at home in the world then?Broadbent: Of course. Don’t you?Keegan (from the very depths of his nature): No.This is the essence of the Romantic dilemma, the problem that caused so many ofthe men of genius of the 19th century to commit suicide or to die in despair—forthe Romantics also experienced this same sense of revulsion on returning to theeveryday world. The crucial question is therefore: is the anticlimax necessaryand inevitable? If the answer is yes, then we are admitting that our humanreality is a kind of trap, and that life is fundamentally futile.But if life is futile, if all effort is a waste of time, then why have wedevoted this book to asking so many questions and formulating answers? Why didwe bother to launch into this exploration of the unknown in the first place? Isit not because, in spite of our rather unstable sense of reality, we have acurious certainty that these questions will lead somewhere, will provide us withanswers that could transform our lives? And if that is so, then surely it meansthat it is possible to do something about human consciousness, to behave in sucha way that we can live on a far higher level of happiness and purpose—in a statethat is far closer to what Abraham Maslow called ‘the peak experience’?This, I am convinced, is true. I have spent more than forty years attempting toanswer this question. Now, as I approach sixty, I am certain that I know theanswer. I have glimpsed it again and again, and lost it again and again. It islike trying to do an enormous jigsaw puzzle which is spread out over the wholefloor of the room. You find half a dozen pieces that interlock, and you quicklyfit them together. But then you pass on to another part of the puzzle in anotherpart of the room, and the part you have ‘solved’ gets forgotten and buried underother pieces as you move them around. And one of the greatest problems is thatthis room called everyday consciousness is too small; you know that the floor issimply not big enough to hold the whole puzzle in its completed state. In anattempt to maintain some kind of order, you try classifying the ‘completed’ bitsof the puzzle under different headings. This book, for example, contains about25% of the bits I have labelled ‘occult’ or ‘paranormal’. (A book with theoff-putting title Beyond the Occult—it was imposed on me by thepublisher—contains about 25% more.) Some of the most promising of the‘completed’ sections are to be found in bocks like The Outsider or The NewExistentialism, which could be labelled ‘philosophy’. Oddly enough, my books oncriminology also contain some of the most interesting parts, and one single page(111 [../Text/09_chapter04.html#page_111]–12[../Text/09_chapter04.html#page_112]) in a book on sexual deviation called TheMisfits contains one of the most important paragraphs in all my work:‘Our human senses show us only a small part of the world—the present. We have tosupplement this present-awareness with memory and imagination. The reason I feelmore ‘alive’ when I set out on holiday is that my memory and imagination arefinally pulling their weight, and supplementing the present moment with allkinds of other times and places. It is as if I am in two places at once. Thesame is true if I am sitting in front of a blazing fire on a cold winter night,with the snow pattering against the windows. I am in two places at once; my bodyis in the warm room, while my imagination is out there, in the cold. But itwould be a mistake to assume that we are talking about mere imagination. We aretalking about something that might be called the sense of reality—what thepsychologist Pierre Janet called ‘the reality function’. Whenever the realityfunction is awake, we are happy.‘In short, before we can feel really alive, the mind needs to add a dimension ofreality to the world of the senses. If there is such a thing as the “greatsecret” of human existence, this is it.’Let me try to explain why I feel that Ouspensky’s attitude about the ‘woodenworld’ was a kind of premature defeatism, the defeatism of a man who was in someways a great thinker, but who was also a typical 19th-century romantic.One of my most basic insights came one day when I was reflecting upon thisproblem of defeatism and pessimism. I was also considering this interesting factthat any kind of crisis immediately arouses us to a higher level of drive andpurpose, so that when it goes away, we momentarily experience a sense of totalfreedom. In Crime and Punishment, the hero Raskolnikov (who has committed amurder) realises that that he might be executed, and reflects: ‘If I had tostand on a narrow ledge for ever and ever, in eternal darkness and tempest, Iwould rather do that than die at once.’ We all know exactly what he means—thatif someone placed a revolver against your head, and said: ‘What is it to be:immediate death, or a narrow ledge for the rest of your life?’, you would replywithout hesitation: ‘Narrow ledge, of course.’ But consider: what would youactually do on a narrow ledge? What is that strange secret that you glimpse,when threatened by crisis, that convinces you that a narrow ledge is preferableto death?These reflections led me to recognise that one of our most basic problems iswhat I labelled ‘upside-downness’. You could say that you have three ‘selves’—aphysical self, an emotional self, and an intellectual (or mental) self. Myphysical values have a nasty habit of changing from one hour to the next; I mayfeel marvellous at ten in the morning, and rather depressed a few hours latermerely because I am hungry or feel tired. But then, we are used to thesephysical ups and down, and do not let them bother us too much. Much moredangerous are our emotional ups and downs. We can have every reason for beingpleased with ourselves and with life, and then some minor problem—a tax demand,someone being rude to us, a flash of alarm—can hurl us into a thoroughlynegative state of mind. Emotions seem to drag us down like a heavy weight.On the other hand, my intellect stands above these physical and emotionalproblems. When I am feeling angry or jealous or upset, another part of me looksdown on it with cool detachment and tells me not to be such a fool. On thewhole, my intellect tells me the truth—or at least, does its best. It is myemotions that often manage to creep in and distort this truth.We might turn this insight into a Chinese parable. When the intellect is theEmperor, and emotions are the Grand Vizier, the kingdom is peaceful and happy.But when the Grand Vizier overthrows the Emperor and usurps the throne,everything becomes confused and chaotic.In our internal political organisation, intellect was meant to be ‘on top’.Emotions were intended to be the servant. What happens when we are upset is thatwe turn ‘upside down’—almost as if our feet had turned into gas-filled balloonsand made us stand on our heads. What is so dangerous is that this can happenwithout us even noticing it. We think we are still clear-headed and rational,but emotion has sneaked in and taken control. Without realising what hashappened, a fog of depression settles over us. Life seems futile and boring. Weare convinced that we have good reason for feeling that life is a cheat and thatfree will is an illusion. All that has happened is that we have turned ‘upsidedown’, and the world from this position looks alien and somehow frightening. Ihave described in Mysteries (and again, in Beyond the Occult) how, during aperiod of severe overwork, I began to suffer from a series of ‘panic attacks’that brought me to the verge of nervous breakdown. All that had happened wasthat I had been overwhelmed by sheer exhaustion, and I could no longer keep myfeet on the ground; every hour or so, I kept finding myself dangling upsidedown, seeing the world as meaningless and dangerous. Only my total intellectualcertainty that this negative vision was an illusion allowed me to struggle ‘theright way up’ and stay in that position.The real trouble is the passivity of human consciousness. We are like cowsstanding around in a field, accepting whatever happens as inevitable. Of course,as soon as some crisis arises, it has the effect of shaking the mind awake, andwe respond magnificently. Suddenly, we recognise that we are free, and that wecan change our lives. But as soon as the crisis is over, we go back to sleepagain, and to chewing the cud.To explain why this happens, I have to repeat a point I made in the firstchapter. We have to recognise that we all have a robot inside us, whose job isto do things for us. I learn to type slowly and painfully; then the robot takesover and does it twice as fast as I could. He also drives my car and talksFrench for me. The problem is that he not only does the things I want, but alsothe things I would rather do myself. If I go for a walk with my robot switchedon, I don’t enjoy the walk; if I eat a meal robotically, I don’t enjoy the food.Although the robot was intended to make our lives more easy and pleasant, heoften goes too far and lives them for us.When this happens, we sink to a lower level of consciousness. What is more, weassume that this lower level of consciousness is telling us the truth about theworld. In fact, it is telling us lies, because it is so dim and dull. Once webegin to see this, we can also grasp that there are a number of distinct levelsof consciousness that every one of us experiences during the course of alifetime.Let us, simply as an exercise, see if we can recognise the most fundamental ofthese levels. Let us start off with the basic state of non-consciousness that weexperience in very deep sleep, and call this Level O. In that case Level 1 isthe level we experience as we dream, and which persists in hypnagogicexperiences.Level 2 is the most basic level of waking consciousness: that is mere awareness.A child experiences this when he is too tired to take any interest in anything.He may be on his way home from a party but he gazes blankly at the passingworld. If you were to ask, ‘What have you just seen?’ he would reply, ‘I don’tknow.’ His consciousness is merely a mirror reflecting the outside world.Nietzsche once said that we envy the cows their placidity, but it would be nouse asking them the secret of their happiness for they would have forgotten thequestion before they could give the answer. This is Level 2.At Level 3 consciousness has become self-aware but it is still dull and heavy—soheavy that we are only aware of one thing at a time: everything seems to be‘merely itself’, utterly without meaning, and your own reflection in a mirrorseems to be a stranger. This is the level that Sartre calls nausea.Level 4 is the normal consciousness we experience every day. It is no longer tooheavy to move: it has learned how to cope with existence yet it tends to thinkof life as a grim battle—possibly a losing battle. Consequently it tends to sinkback easily towards Level 3 and to find experience meaningless and boring.So far the one thing the levels all have in common is a basically passiveattitude towards life and experience. At Level 5 this ceases to be so. This is alevel that I have labelled provisionally ‘spring morning consciousness’ or‘holiday consciousness’. It is characterized by that bubbling feeling ofhappiness we experience when life suddenly becomes more interesting and excitingand all kinds of prospects seem to be opening up in front of us. Quite suddenlycaution and doubt disappear; life becomes self-evidently fascinating anddelightful. This is the feeling that Hesse’s Steppenwolf experiences as hetastes a glass of wine and is reminded of ‘Mozart and the stars’.Level 6 could be labelled the ‘magical level’. It is what happens to a child onChristmas Day, when everything combines to make life seem wonderful. Or imaginethe consciousness of two honeymooners on their wedding night looking down from abalcony on to a moonlit lake, with the dark shapes of mountains in the distance.In such states we feel a total reconciliation with our lives. ‘For momentstogether my heart stood still between delight and sorrow to find how rich wasthe gallery of my life,’ says Steppenwolf. Problems seem trivial; we see thatthe one real virtue is courage. Consciousness has become a continuous mild peakexperience, what J. B. Priestley calls ‘delight’.Level 7 is the state I have called (in The Occult) Faculty X – the odd abilityto sense the reality of other times and places Proust says in Swann’s Way I hadceased to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal. . . .’ This is more than a peakexperience: it is an odd sense of mastery over time, as if every moment of yourlife could be recalled as clearly as the last ten minutes. We suddenly realisethat time is a manifestation of the heaviness of the body and the feebleness ofthe spirit. We can also see that if we could learn to achieve this condition ofcontrol permanently, time would become, in a basic sense, non-existent.The most interesting thing about the levels beyond Level 7—the levels exploredby Ouspensky and other mystics—is that they seem to contradict the evidence ofour senses and of everyday consciousness. The inner becomes the outer, the outerbecomes the inner, man is the whole universe and a mere atom, space and time areseen to be illusions and so on. Yet we can see that these contradictions arealready inherent in everyday consciousness. At Level 2 consciousness has no kindof ‘connectedness’; it is merely a flow of meaningless impressions. Level3—nausea—starts to arrest this flow, to connect things together, but it keepscollapsing into a sudden perception that the world is after all quitemeaningless and futile. Level 4—ordinary consciousness—’connects’ things to afar higher degree, yet it still takes it for granted that life is an endlessuphill struggle and that we have to make a continuous effort to see any meaningin it. At Level 5—’holiday consciousness’—all this changes: there is a sense ofbeing able to see to distant horizons, of becoming aware of ‘Mozart and thestars’. We suddenly realize that the world around us is so fascinating in itselfthat no effort is required. Everything makes us think of something else and sowe are kept in a continuous state of interest and excitement.At Level 6—’magic consciousness’—we seem to be floating in a sea of meaning andfind it hard to understand how we could ever have been unhappy, or how anyoneelse could be. Even the worst experiences of the past now seem deeplyinteresting attempts to teach us something, essential steps on the upward pathto this sense of optimism and control. The only tragedy in the universe seems tobe that so many people lack the courage and sheer dogged stubbornness to keepgoing and so miss this literally ‘heavenly’ sense of wonder and reconciliation.Level 7, with its sense of freedom, of mastery over time, is only a short stepfrom the mystical level, just as Level 6—’magic’—is only a short step fromFaculty X. A sudden additional effort can carry the mind over the threshold intothat strange realm where ‘separateness’ is seen to be a delusion caused byfatigue and everything is seen to be connected. One of the most encouragingthings about this insight into the levels is that each level is only a short andeasy step away from the previous one.Now if you look at this list you will notice an interesting thing about Level4—our ordinary everyday consciousness. At the ‘bottom end’ it is still dull andheavy, like waking up with a hangover. Life is no longer horrible andmeaningless, as it is in Level 3 (‘nausea’), but it is still an uphill struggle.But as you continue to fight back, your ‘engine’ warms up, and you begin toexperience an increasing sense of optimism, a feeling that obstacles are beingovercome. ‘Three down, seven still to go.’ And a point comes—about halfway—whensuddenly you are enjoying life, and even the struggle gives you pleasure, like astrong swimmer who enjoys battling against a powerful current.The turning-point is Level 3½. And three and a half is precisely half of seven.Until you reach 3½, life is an uphill struggle. After 3½, it is all downhill.And at the top end of Level 4, we are bubbling with optimism, and what Maslowcalls the peak experience, the experience of overflowing happiness, carries usup to Level 5, ‘holiday consciousness’. You could say that the peak experienceis a spark that leaps the spark-gap between levels 4 and 5.In other words, below 3½ you are toiling uphill; beyond Level Level 3½, it isall downhill. The odd thing is that most healthy people spend their days fairlyclose to Level 3½. If they made a slightly larger effort, they would be over thetop of the hill.Let me put this another way. You could say that, for practical purposes, you arenormally 50% robot, and 50% what you might call ‘real you’. When you feel tired,you sink to 51% robot, and 49% ‘real you’. On the other hand, when you feelcheerful and optimistic, you are 49% robot and 51% real you. In moods of greatoptimism—setting out on holiday, for example—you become 52% real you and only48% robot.That ‘turning point’—the 50/50 level—is also what we have called ‘Level 3½’.And now it should be possible to see the answer to what I called ‘the Outsiderproblem’ (in the first chapter of this book). Those 19th-century Outsiders hadmarvellous glimpses of sheer delight, when it seemed self-evident that the wholeuniverse is marvellous. Then they woke up the next morning, and the olddepression was back again. They told themelves that the ‘moments of delight’were an illusion, or that they are bound to disappear as the ‘shades of theprison house begin to close’ around us. This is why so many of them committedsuicide or died of wasting diseases that were caused by discouragement.What we can see clearly is that they were making a simple mistake. The ‘momentsof delight’ are not an illusion. They are a perfectly normal consequence ofraising consciousness above level 3½.But how do we do that?The answer is obvious. The romantics were defeated by their sense of gloom, bytheir conviction that life is a trap and that ‘you can’t win’. It was thisconviction that kept them below Level 3½. Notice that as soon as you feeloptimistic, your energy levels rise. And if you were in a 50/50 state, theoptimism has the effect of pushing you up to 51% ‘real you’ and 49% robot. Themere knowledge that we are so close to the ‘turning point’ is enough to push us‘over the top of the hill’. Maslow noticed that people who constantly had ‘peakexperiences’ were all cheerful and healthy people. The peak experiences madethem cheerful and healthy, and the health made them have peak experiences. Theromantics, on the other hand, were convinced that life is one long defeat, sothey immersed themselves in gloom and self-pity. There is no better formula forremaining below Level 3½. They were in a state of ‘negative feedback’.This is the fundamental reason that I am convinced that the human race is on thepoint of an evolutionary leap to a higher stage. Our evolution has been broughtabout by the long, slow acquisition of knowledge, from the moment one of ourape-like ancestors learned to use a sharp stone as a hatchet. Now we haveacquired the most important piece of knowledge of all: the knowledge of howclose we are to Level 3½. What it means, in effect, is that human beings areclose to the level at which they will recognise that they possess the power toremain above Level 3½.And precisely how do we do this—in terms of everyday living? Again, we all knowthe answer without realising that we know it. When I walk out of my room andinto a busy street, I am inclined to wince at the impact of ‘everyday reality’.I am, in effect, 49% ‘real me’. But I can make that small additional effort tocope with reality, to expect positive instead of negative things to happen—inshort, to push myself up that extra 1% that will make all the difference and,having achieved it, to push myself up another 1%, beyond Level 3½.At this point a personal experience may help to make my point. In 1987, I was ona lecture tour in Japan. I do not enjoy travel—I have the natural Outsider’spreference for my own home—and I found that it was important to make a consciouseffort not to allow myself to slip into a state of boredom and indifference inthe crowded streets of Tokyo or Hiroshima. One evening, after a particularlycrowded day, my wife and I were being taken to a theatrical performance by ourinterpreter. I would greatly have preferred to stay in my hotel room and rest,and have to admit that I had allowed myself to lose interest in the eveningahead. I had slipped, without noticing it, into a state of ‘upside-downness’.The theatre was in a very long street, with metal barriers on either side toforce pedestrians to cross at the traffic light. But the traffic light wasseveral hundred yards away. The street was empty, and our interpreter duckedunderneath the barrier, and beckoned us to follow her. As we started to cross,the lights changed, and a sports car roared towards us at 50 miles an hour. Ijerked myself out of my state of indifference, grabbed my wife’s arm, and hauledher across the road as fast as I could. And that ‘awakening’ made me aware thatI had permitted myself to slip into a state of upside-downness. As I sat in thetheatre a few minutes later, I reflected that if my boredom had resulted in mywife being struck by a sports car, I would never have forgiven myself. My‘indifference’ vanished, and I made a determined attempt to give my fullattention to the play.Early the next morning, we were on our way out of Tokyo, being taken to somedistant place in the country; and roaring along the crowded freeway at 70 milesan hour, I reflected on the incident of the evening before, and on myrecognition that it is of vital importance never to allow ourselves to sink intostates of bored resentment. And now I recalled an image that I had used in thefinal chaper of my book The Quest for Wilhelm Reich. It had struck me that‘ordinary consciousness’ has a substratum of boredom. It is disorganised, likebilliard balls spread at random over a billiard table. As soon as somethingarouses our interest, we make a mental effort which pulls all the billiard ballstogether into the centre of the table. When we lose interest, or become tired,they spread all over the tabletop again.If we become deeply absorbed, we make an additional effort of concentration, andthis seems to have the odd effect of compressing the billiard balls stillfurther, so they seem to climb on top of one another, forming a second tier. Andat this point, I become aware of the power of my own mind. I realise that if Imade a still greater effort of concentration, I could make the billiard ballsclimb up into a third layer, and even a fourth. What is so interesting aboutthis procedure is that as I become increasingly ‘absorbed’ (T.E. Lawrence onceremarked ‘Happiness is absorption’) my mental power seems to increase, and I cansee that if I could maintain this level of energy, it should be possible to makethe billiard balls form into a pyramid. It is a process of ‘positive feedback’,where interest releases further energy and excitement, and the excitementdeepens our interest. And, that being so, the pyramid need never collapse. Thebilliard balls ‘spread out’ only because we lose vigilance. We forget. And if wecould once achieve that intense level of excitement and interest, the universewould be so obviously fascinating that we would never be tempted to allow ourattention to lapse.As we drove along the Tokyo freeway, I experienced a state of intenseexcitement. I felt that I had achieved a ‘bird’s eye view’ of the problem ofhuman existence—what I sometimes call ‘a hole in one’. (I do not play golf, butthe analogy seems apt.) This, I saw, was the answer, the key to the next phaseof man’s evolution. And because I was able to formulate that insight so clearlyin words, it has remained with me ever since. I recognise that this is thesolution of the ‘Outsider problem’ that preoccupied me throughout my teens.You may feel that this problem hardly concerns the average ‘insider’ who goesabout his daily business. This is untrue. The Outsider problem permeates ourcivilisation. Every serious thinker and artist in the world has to struggle withit to some extent. And most of them are still trapped in the pessimism that ledso many of the romantics to despair. Think of any ‘serious’ writer of the 20thcentury, and you will immediately recognise that basic pessimism—Proust, Joyce,Eliot, Musil, Valery, Hemingway, Sartre, Camus, Greene, Beckett, Derrida and therest. It permeates the attitudes of philosophers, painters and musicians. Whenour ancestors look back on the 20th century, they will shake their heads andsay: ‘They lived in a negative culture’.Consider again what happens when you have been threatened by some crisis, whichis then averted. You not only experience a sense of relief. You also experiencea curious sense of insight, of what G.K. Chesterton called ‘absurd good news’.Hans Keller, the director of BBC music programmes, described how he had been inGermany during the late 1930s. As a Jew, he was in danger of disappearing into aconcentration camp. He records that he prayed: ‘O God, let me escape fromGermany and I promise I will never be unhappy again for the rest of my life.’ Itsuddenly seemed to him that it would be so easy to remain ecstatically happy forthe rest of his life, if only he could escape from the Nazis. In fact, he didnot keep his promise—he was generally known as a rather touchy and oversensitivelittle man. But then, human beings have never learned to keep that particularpromise—not because they are lazy, but because they don’t yet know how.But think what happens when you are in some situation of crisis. Suddenly, youare giving your full attention to the crisis. And you feel that, when the crisisis over, you will continue to give the same full attention to life withoutcrisis. This is why Keller thought it would be ‘so easy’ to be happy for therest of his life.Think of being in bed on a freezing winter morning, when you have to get up inten minutes. The bed has never seemed so warm and comfortable. Yet on a Sunday,when you can stay in bed as long as you like, you can no longer re-create thatfeeling of comfort and warmth. Why?Because when you have to get up in ten minutes, it is as if you are looking in amirror, conscious of yourself and of your situation. It is the same for a manstanding on the scaffold, waiting to be hanged. He is paying total attention tohis situation.We have returned to John Cowper Powys and the subject of Chapter One[../Text/06_chapter01.html]. As Wolf Solent sits in the railway carriage, he ispaying total attention to his situation—to the seaside posters with their flyspots, to the telegraph poles flashing past the window. Yet he is also totallyaware of himself, like a man relaxing in a warm bath.Whenever human beings experience that deep sense of happiness and meaning, it isbecause they are ‘paying attention’. If you eat a meal without paying attention,you do not enjoy it. But the reason that you can experience that sense ofexpanding happiness when setting out on a journey is that you are payingattention, and attention is somehow expanding, so you are aware of far more thanyour immediate situation. In some strange way, you are aware of other times andother places. It is almost as if you are in two places at once. This is whathuman consciousness should be like all the time. This is what it will be likewhen we have taken that next evolutionary step.When I was a child, I was often told to chew my food properly, or it would giveme indigestion. What I am now pointing out is that when we are happy, it isbecause we are chewing our experience properly—as you do in bed on a cold wintermorning. Otherwise, we tend to swallow experience unchewed, and it does no good.This is what Socrates meant when he said: ‘The unexamined life is not worthliving.’But in order for this analogy with chewing to take on its full significance, wehave to suppose that if a child swallowed food without chewing it, the foodwould remain undigested, and would fail to have any nutritive effect whatever.For this is what happens with ‘unchewed’ experience: it passes straight throughus, and contributes nothing to our growth. That is why so many unreflectivepeople are spiritually stunted.Human beings have to learn to become ‘reflective’, to chew their experience, tosavour it. We see this truth every time we experience crisis and wish it wouldgo away. We suddenly see how easy it would be to savour every moment of ourlives. We have to learn to calm ourselves down, to relax, to go inwards. R.H.Ward said that when he tried to put the essence of his mystical experience intowords, he saw it as a repetition of ‘Within and within and within and within . ..’ like a repeating decimal.Although mystics have known this for centuries, it is only within the past twoand a half centuries that the ‘trick’ has begun to spread to the rest of us—tobe more specific, since 1740. I am not, of course, claiming that Richardson’sPamela was the first sign of this development. Throughout recorded history menhave had this curious longing to escape into the world of the mind, the world ofmyths and stories, and that ‘eternal longing’ is manifested in The Epic ofGilgamesh and the Odyssey and the Greek drama and the Canterbury Tales and theElizabethan drama and Don Quixote and Grimmelshausen’s Simplicissimus andRobinson Crusoe. But because Pamela was the first ‘soap opera’, it was awatershed, somehow as different from Don Quixote as a steamship is from asailing ship. It taught people to pay attention to their own lives instead ofdreaming about mythical heroes and faraway places with strange-sounding names.Ever since Pamela, man has been trying to absorb that lesson. But the industrialrevolution made life far more hectic, preventing us from ‘paying attention’. Sowe continue to swallow our experience without chewing it, and wondering why wesuffer from indigestion. We have to consciously learn to make that effort tochew. The great heroes of this new phase of human evolution are not theconquerors, or even the scientists, but the men who have taught us to reflect,to ‘mythologise’, to go ‘within and within and within . . .’Meanwhile, we remain trapped in a negative culture, whose cult figures areartists and writers who remain convinced that life is basically meaningless ortragic. Here, for example, is a typical passage from the French philosopher andcritic Roland Barthes:‘. . . the art of living has no history; it does not evolve: the pleasure whichvanishes vanishes for good, and there is no substitute for it. Other pleasurescome, which replace nothing. No progress in pleasures, nothing but mutation.’1This is still the same pessimism that we can find in the Romantics, from Novalisto Verlaine. And he is clearly missing the point: that the only way ofpreventing experience from ‘vanishing for good’ is to ‘permanise’ it through‘attention’. This word processor on which I am writing has a key labelled‘save’, and when I press it, the words I have written are transferred from thescreen to the disc. Now they are recorded, fixed—as writing ‘fixes’ our speech.If my word processor is accidentally switched off before I have pressed the‘save’ key, the words ‘vanish for good’. Barthes, like so many of his fellowromantics, has simply failed to realise that his brain has a ‘save’ key, andthat it is because we have learned to use this key that human beings haveevolved faster than any other animal.Now it should be clear why I think that ‘the paranormal’ is of such immenseimportance. Here is one field that is untinged by contemporary pessimism. Theclear message that emerges is that man possesses powers of which he is normallyunaware. As Richard Church watched the gardener wielding the axe, and noticedthat the sound came after the blow, he says that he experienced a marvelloussense of freedom. His enemy so far had been ‘the drag of the earth’. Now herealised that he had been overestimating the enemy. It was at that moment thathe made an instinctive effort and rose from the ground and glided about theroom. When man can clearly recognise the existence of these powers, andincorporate that recognition into his everyday awareness—so that he is no longersubject to a permanent ‘leakage’ of vitality—then he will suddenly have become atotally different kind of creature. 1.

From Barthes by Barthes."},{"pageContent":"AppendixIT SEEMS wortwhile to explain how I came to be converted from the notion thatpoltergeists are simply a form of ‘spontaneous psychokinesis’, due to the hiddenpowers of the unconscious mind, to the conviction that they are independent‘spirits’. It began in 1976, when I presented the Rosenheim case on BBCtelevision.In 1967 the office of a lawyer in Rosenheim, Bavaria, became the scene of anumber of violent poltergeist disturbances. Light tubes shattered, picturesturned on the walls and a heavy filing cabinet was moved as if it weighed only afew pounds. Moreover the telephone bill was enormous because hundreds of callshad apparently been made to the talking clock – more calls than were physicallypossible in the time available.The ‘poltergeist’ was apparently getting straightthrough the relays. A well-known professor of parapsychology from Freiburg, HansBender, went to investigate the case and soon observed that the disturbancesonly took place when a young girl named Anne-Marie Schaberl was in the office.Anne-Marie was a country girl who was unhappy working in a town; her family lifehad been difficult – her father was a strict disciplinarian – and she wasmistrustful and tense. Bender took her back to his laboratory to try varioustests for extra-sensory perception and she showed remarkable telepathicabilities. And while Anne-Marie was in Freiburg the disturbances in the officeceased. But they continued at the mill where she found work: when someone waskilled in an accident Anne-Marie was blamed, and she left. Her fiancé broke offhis engagement to her because she had such an extraordinary effect on theelectronic scoring equipment at his favourite bowling alley. Finally she marriedand had a child, and the manifestations ceased.Anne-Marie had no suspicion that she was the cause of the disturbances in thelawyer’s office: indeed when I met him during the course of the programmeProfessor Bender told me that one of the first rules of poltergeistinvestigation is not to tell the ‘disturbed adolescent’ that he – or she – isthe real cause of the disturbances, for it usually terrifies them.In 1980 I heard of a poltergeist haunting that was even more astonishing thanthe Rosenheim case. It had taken place in Pontefract in Yorkshire and I heardabout it from a friend of the family concerned, who seemed to think that itmight make a book rather like the best-selling Amityville Horror. Thepoltergeist had, it seemed, wrecked practically every breakable item in thehouse and made such loud drumming noises at night that neighbours gathered incrowds to listen. But in this case a number of people concerned had apparentlyalso seen the poltergeist, which took the form of a monk dressed in black. Thefriend of the family who contacted me was also interested in local history andtold me that his researches had revealed that there had once been a gallows onthe site of the house, and that a Cluniac monk had been hanged there for rape inthe time of Henry VIII.The story sounded almost too good to be true. But before deciding to write aboutit I asked a friend who lived in the area, Brian Marriner, to go andinvestigate. He wrote me a long letter in which he outlined the story of thehaunting, and I was left in no doubt that this was a genuine case, not a hoax.The daughter of the family, Diane Pritchard, had been dragged upstairs by thethroat by ‘Black Monk’ and thrown out of bed repeatedly. But the ghost alsoseemed to have a sense of humour. When Aunt Maude, a determined sceptic, came tosee for herself, a jug of milk floated out of the refrigerator and poured itselfover her head. Later what looked like two enormous hands appeared around thedoor: they proved to be Aunt Maude’s fur gloves. As the gloves floated into thebedroom Mrs Pritchard asked indignantly, ‘Do you still think it’s the kids doingit?’ Aunt Maude burst into ‘Onward Christian Soldiers’ and the gloves proceededto conduct her singing, beating in time.Having studied Brian Marriener’s report on the case I concluded that there wasnot enough material there for a full-length book, but it would make an admirablecentre-piece for a book on the poltergeist, on which there is an immense amountof well-authenticated material. Poltergeist cases seem to be among the mostfrequent of paranormal events – at any given moment there is likely to be onegoing on within a dozen miles of where you are now reading this book. This, Iconcluded, is because the world is so full of sexually disturbed adolescents. Isketched out an outline of a history of poltergeist phenomena and submitted itto my publisher, who wrote back to say he liked the idea. Then, accompanied bymy wife, I set out for Yorkshire to investigate for myself.On our way to Pontefract we stopped for a night at the Hayes Conference Centrein Swanwick, Derbyshire, where I was to lecture at a conference on theparanormal. The following afternoon, just as we were about to leave, someonementioned that Guy Playfair was due to arrive in half an hour. He and I hadcorresponded but had never met. So although I was anxious to get on to YorkshireI decided to stay around for another half hour to introduce myself. It proved tobe one of those fateful decisions that exercise an immeasurable influence on thefuture.Guy, I knew, had spent some time in Rio de Janeiro, where he had joined theBrazilian equivalent of the Society for Psychical Research and studied the localversion of black magic, umbanda. I knew his book The Indefinite Boundary, ascientific study of the paranormal, and was impressed by its logic anddetachment. I was just as impressed by Playfair himself, a quietly-spoken manwhose modest utterances nevertheless carried total conviction. For half an houror so we talked about ley lines, animal homing and telepathy. Then, just as itwas about time to leave, I told him I was writing a book on the poltergeist andasked his opinion. He frowned, hesitated, then said, ‘I think it’s a kind offootball.’ ‘Football!’ I wondered if I’d misheard him: ‘A football of energy.When people get into conditions of tension, they exude a kind of energy – thekind of thing that happens to teenagers at puberty. Along come a couple ofspirits, and they do what any group of schoolboys would so – they begin to kickit around, smashing windows and generally creating havoc. Then they get tiredand leave it. In fact the football often explodes, and turns into a puddle ofwater.’‘So you mean a poltergeist is actually a spirit?’‘That’s right. I’m not saying there’s not such a thing as spontaneouspsychokinesis. But most poltergeists are spirits.’ And he advised me to read theFrench spiritualist Allan Kardec.I must admit that I found this notion hard to swallow. Ever since making theprogramme on the Rosenheim case I had taken it for granted that poltergeists aresome kind of strange manifestation of the unconsious mind. I was not sure wherethe energy came from, but suspected that it was from the earth itself. I hadseen a dowser standing above an underground spring, his fingers locked togetherand his hands pumping up and down so violently that the sweat poured down hisface: he was obviously unable to stop himself while his hands were together. Andat a dowsing conference I had been introduced to an old lady who sometimespicked up a large fallen branch and used it as a dowsing rod. Suspended in onehand, it would swing from side to side like a huge voltmeter needle. It seemedto me highly likely that the energy used by the poltergeist flows from the earthvia the right brain of the disturbed adolescent. And now Guy Playfair wasadvising me to abandon these carefully constructed theories and return to a viewthat sounded like crude mediaeval superstition.The following afternoon we arrived at the home of Joe and Jean Pritchard inPontefract. It was the typically neat home of an upper-working-class family.Their nineteen-year-old son Phillip was at home, and during the course of theafternoon their daughter Diane came over with her husband to join us. These twohad been the unconscious cause of the events that had caused a local sensationin 1966. I asked how the disturbances had begun. ‘With these pools of water onthe kitchen floor.’ Joy and I looked at one another. ‘Can you describe theirshape?’ Mrs Pritchard shook her head. ‘They were just neat little pools – likeoverturning an ink bottle.’ This, according to Playfair, was a description ofthe pools of water created by the explosion of the ‘energy football’. He said itwas almost impossible to make them by pouring water on the floor – from a jugfor example – because it splashes. These pools look as if a small cat has placedits behind close to the floor and urinated. I began to feel that there might besomething in his spirit theory after all.Mrs Pritchard said that as fast as they mopped up the pools they reappearedelsewhere. But waterboard officials could find no leak. And when the tap wasturned on green foam rushed out. Then the button of the tea dispenser began tomove in and out, covering the draining board with dry tea leaves; lightsswitched on and off and a plant-pot somehow found its way from the bottom to thetop of the stairs.This first set of manifestations occurred in 1966 and Phillip was obviously thefocus since Diane way away on holiday at the time. Two days later, they ceased.But when they began again in 1968, Diane – now fourteen – had become the focus.The ghost seldom paid a visit during the day, when she was at school. But in theevening the racket would start – usually a noise like a child beating a big drum– and ornaments would levitate across the room while the lights turnederratically on and off. Yet the poltergeist did not seem malicious – rather aninfuriating practical joker. After a tremendous crash all the contents of thechina cabinet were found scattered around the sitting room, yet not one was evencraked. When the vicar came to try to exorcise the poltergeist and told thefamily that he thought their trouble was subsidence, a candlestick rose from theshelf and floated under his nose. The exorcism was unsuccessful.Diane found it frightening, yet less so than might be expected. She always had akind of inward notification when the pranks were about to start. Hurledviolently out of bed with the mattress on top of her, she was unhurt. When thehall stand – made of heavy oak – floated through the air and pinned her down onthe stairs (with a sewing machine on top of it for good measure) she was unableto move and the family were unable to budge it, yet she was not even bruised.When the ghost – whom they called Mr Nobody – hurled the grandfather clockdownstairs so that it burst like a bomb, no one was anywhere near.At a fairly late stage in the haunting the ghost began to show itself. Jean andJoe Pritchard awakened one night to see a dim figure standing in the opendoorway. Their next-door neighbour was standing at the sink when she feltsomeone standing behind her: it proved to be a tall figure in a monk’s habitwith a cowl over the head. It looked so solid and normal that she felt no alarm:then it vanished. Another neighbour, Rene Holden (who was a bit psychic), was inthe Pritchards’ sitting room when the lights went out. In the faint glow of thestreetlamp that came through the curtains she saw the lower half of a figuredressed in a long black garment.The haunting was nearing its climax. One evening when the lights went out Dianewas heard to scream: the family rushed into the had and found her being draggedup the stairs. The ghost seemed to have one hand on her cardigan, which wasstretched out in front of her, and the other on her throat. As Phillip and JeanPritchard grabbed her the ghost let go, and they all tumbled down the stairs.Diane’s throat was covered with red finger-marks yet Mr Nobody had not exertedenough pressure to hurt her. Soon after this Jean Pritchard came downstairs tofind the hall carpet soaked in water; on the wet surface there were hugefootprints.One day Phillip and Diane were watching television when they both saw the BlackMonk – or at least his shape – silhouetted on the other side of the frostedglass door that led to the dining room. As Phillip opened the door they saw histall, black shape in the process of vanishing. It seemed to disappear into thekitchen floor. And that was the end of the Pontefract haunting. Mr Nobodydisappeared and has not been heard from since.I spent the whole of that Sunday afternoon listening to recordings of thepoltergeist making violent banging noises, and questioning the family andneighbours. I also read the accounts contained in the local newspapers at thetime. There could not be the slightest reasonable doubt that the haunting wasgenuine: there were too many witnesses.Even if I had not met Guy Playfair some of the features of the case would havepuzzled me. This poltergeist behaved more like a ghost, and its connection withthe former Cluniac monastery and the local gallows was fairly well established.In that case the theory that it was a really a kind of astral juveniledelinquent from Diane’s unconscious mind seemed absurd. Besides, as Dianedescribed her feelings as she was pulled upstairs by Mr Nobody I experienced asudden total conviction that this was an independent entity, not a split-offfragment of her own psyche. When I left the Pritchards’ house that afternoon Ihad no doubt whatever that Guy Playfair was right: poltergeists are spirits.It was an embarrassing admission to have to make. With the exception of GuyPlayfair there is probably not a single respectable parapsychologist in theworld who will publicly admit the existence of spirits. Many will concede inprivate that they are inclined to to accept the evidence for life after death,but in print even that admission would be regarded as a sign of weakness. Beforethat trip to Pontefract I had been in basic agreement with them: it seemedtotally unnecessary to assume the existence of spirits. Tom Lethbridge’s‘tape-recording’ theory explained hauntings; the unconsciousness’ and the‘information universe’ combined to explain mysteries like telepathy,psychometry, even precognition. Spirits were totally irrelevant. Yet thePontefract case left me in no probability of some local monk who died in asudden and violent death, perhaps on the gallows, and who might or might not beaware that he was dead. And I must admit that it still causes me a kind of flashof protest to write such a sentence: the rationalist in me wants to say, ‘Ohcome off it. . .’ Yet the evidence points clearly in that direction and it wouldbe simple dishonesty not to admit it.When I returned from Yorkshire I took a deep breath and plunged into the annalsof poltergeist activity with the aid of the library at the Society for PsychicalResearch and the College of Psychic Studies. The picture that now began toemerge made me aware of how far my preconceptions had caused me to impose anunnatural logic on the whole subject of the paranormal. It was not so much thatthe conceptions underlying my previous books The Occult and Mysteries were wrongas that they were incomplete. And much of the evidence required to complete themhad been staring me in the face from the beginning."},{"pageContent":"This edition published in the UK and USA in 2011 byWatkins Publishing, Sixth Floor, Castle House,75–76 Wells Street, London WIT 3QHFirst published in paperback as The Mammoth Book of Supernatural byRobinson Publishing in 1991, reprinted in 1997Published by Magpie Books, a Division of Robinson Publishing, in paperback asThe Giant Book of the Supernatural in 1994Text copyright © Colin and Damon Wilson, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2011Colin and Damon Wilson have asserted their right under the Copyright, Designsand Patents Act, 1988 to be identified as the authors of this work.All rights reserved.No part of this book may be reproduced or utilized in any form or by any means,electronic or mechanical, without prior permission in writing from thePublishers.1 3 5 7 9 10 8 6 4 2Typeset by Dorchester Typesetting Group LtdPrinted and bound by Imago in ChinaBritish Library Cataloguing-in-Publication Data AvailableLibrary of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data AvailableISBN: 978-1-907486-55-5www.watkinspublishing.co.uk [http://www.watkinspublishing.co.uk]"}]
