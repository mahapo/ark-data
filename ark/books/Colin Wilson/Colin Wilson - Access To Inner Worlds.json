A man with a strong foreign accent explained to me that hewas from some international press agency, and that he was ringing to tell methat Albert Camus had been killed in a car accident. For a moment I suspected ajoke; my friend Bill Hopkins often rang me up pretending to be a Chineselaundry, or the head of the women’s section of the KGB with just one vacancy fora male. The journalist soon convinced me that he was genuine; he knew too muchabout the accident to be making it up. Camus had been driving back to Paris withhis friend Michel Gallimard when a front tyre burst. The car hit a tree andCamus was catapulted through the rear window; he was killed instantly.On my way to the station a few minutes later—I was going to meet my wife—I triedto grasp the fact that Camus was dead. He worked for Gallimard, my Frenchpublisher, and had been about to write an introduction to my second book. I hadmet him in Paris and found him immensely likeable. Yet now, trying to focus themeaning of his death, I found myself unable to summon any reaction. It was likeringing a doorbell and hearing no sound. When I asked myself: ‘How do you feelabout his death?’, the answer was a kind of: ‘So what?’Yet, in a sense, this was appropriate. The starting-point of all Camus’s work isthis sense of meaningless, that feeling of alienation that he called ‘theabsurd’. Meursault, the hero of L’Etranger, experiences this same inability toreact to the death of his mother. ‘Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday; Ican’t be sure ...’ He is not heartless or self-centred, merely trapped in thepresent. It would not even be true to say he is bored, he seems reasonablycontented. But his sense of meaning is limited to what goes on at the end of hisnose.Then, at the end of the book—when he has been sentenced to death for killing anArab—he experiences a surge of anger that brings insight. ‘It was as if thatgreat rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and...I laid myheart open to the benign indifference of the universe.’ Staring at the stars hecomments: ‘To feel it so like myself...made me realize that I’d been happy, andthat I was happy still.’ This seems an odd statement from a man who seems toplod through life like a blinkered horse. Is it possible to be happy withoutknowing it?Here we confront a paradox; for the answer is yes. We have all experienced themoments that William James calls ‘melting moods’, when it suddenly becomesperfectly obvious that life is infinitely fascinating. And the insight seems toapply retrospectively. Periods of my life that seemed confusing and dull at thetime now seem complex and rather charming. It is almost as if some otherperson—a more powerful and mature individual—has taken over my brain. This‘higher self’ views my problems and anxieties with kindly detachment, butentirely without pity. Looking at problems through his eyes, I can see I was afool to worry about them.If I could remain in this state all the time—or at least, summon it at will—lifewould be a continual adventure. And this is the maddening absurdity. For duringthese moments of intensity and affirmation, we can see that it would be so easyto maintain this insight. Whenever we face crisis or difficulty, we can see thatlife without it would be delightful. Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment saysthat he would rather stand on a narrow ledge for ever than die at once. But wedo not have to go that far to see that life without crisis or misery is full ofpotentiality. I can recognize this truth even when a minor inconveniencedisappears. If the lavatory is out of order for a week, I heave a sigh of reliefwhen the plumber finally appears. The fact that I can now stop flushing it downwith buckets of water becomes an extension of my freedom, a source of activepleasure. And it continues to be so until I begin ‘taking it for granted’. Whenthis happens, I slip into the state in which Meursault spends most of his life:happy without realizing it.What is wrong with human beings? Why is it, as Fichte says, that ‘to be free isnothing; to become free is heavenly’? Why is it that we seem to be unable toappreciate our freedom unless it is under threat? Why do human beings seem tolive in an almost permanent state of unreality?The basic answer is that human beings are the only creatures who spend 99 percent of their time living inside their own heads. Sherlock Holmes used to keep acabinet filled with press cuttings on every subject under the sun, so that if hewas confronted with a mystery involving, let us say, an American oilmillionaire, he could send Watson to the file for a sketch of the man’s career.We all have similar filing cabinets inside our own heads, and they contain‘press cuttings’ (some of them rather brittle and faded) of everything that hasever happened to us. Confronted by some irritating problem, we can look in thefile to see whether anything like it has ever happened in the past. This meansthat we can brood on these matters while lying in bed with our eyes closed; theexperience is all there in the filing cabinet.But this method has its disadvantages. When I am dealing with the real world, Ireact to it in a sensible and balanced manner, and find many problemsexhilarating. When I am lying in bed with my eyes closed, I am out of touch withreality; the result is that I am likely to over-react to problems, and workmyself into a state of anger or frustration or depression. And even when I amsupposed to be ‘in touch with reality’ during the day, I spend a great deal ofmy time in that library with its filing cabinets. Every time I stare out of awindow, or wait at a bus stop, or sit in the midst of a traffic jam, I descendinto my mental world, and virtually lose touch with reality.This ability to ‘live inside our heads’ is, of course, one of the greatestevolutionary advances made by the human race. Grey Walter remarks in his book onthe brain that a chimpanzee ‘cannot maintain a mental image long enough toreflect on it’.Human beings can not only maintain mental images; they can spend hours at a timein a world of imagination. The purpose of this faculty is to enable us toenvisage the future and anticipate its problems. Yet it has one enormousdisadvantage, it means that we can, without even noticing it, lose contact withthe world of actuality. There is an old joke of a man going to borrow alawn-mower from his next door neighbour. On the way there, he imagines hisneighbour saying: ‘Why don’t you buy one of your own?’, to which he replies:‘Because I can’t afford it.’ ‘Then why not get one on hire purchase?’ ‘I don’tlike being in debt.’ ‘Yet you’re willing to come and borrow mine...’ At thispoint he meets his neighbour in the front garden and shouts: ‘Keep your bloodylawn-mower...’ We all allow similar fantasies to undermine the sense of reality.And we are totally unaware of how far the fantasy has taken on a life of itsown. Man is the only animal who is prone to insanity; and this is because hespends so much time in this suffocating prison inside his own head. Hisfantasies creep all over him, like ivy on a tree, until they drain away hislife.This is why the moments of reality—like Meursault’s sense of relief andhappiness—come as such a shock. Our mental apparatus reduces things tooversimplified images, and we come to accept these as a fair copy of the reality‘out there’. And then, in some moment of relaxation and happiness, the realitybursts through, infinitely more exciting than our dehydrated mental images. Itis more real, heavier, richer, more beautiful, and it fills us with a desire tolive for ever. Camus describes such a moment at the end of his story ‘The WomanTaken in Adultery’. Her ‘adultery’ is with the African night, which enters intoher being and possesses her. ‘Not a breath, not a sound, except at intervals themuffled crackling of stones that the cold was reducing to sand...After a moment,however, it seemed to her that the sky above her was moving in a sort of slowgyration. In the vast reaches of the dry, cold night, thousands of stars wereconstantly appearing, and their sparkling icicles, loosened at once, begin toslip gradually towards the horizon. Janine could not tear herself away fromcontemplating these drifting flares. She was turning with them...’The passagebrings to mind another ‘woman taken in adultery’—Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley—andher own mystical sense of living nature as she returns home after love-making:‘in the twilight the world seemed a dream; the trees in the park seemed bulgingand surging at anchor on a tide, and the heave of the slope to the house wasalive’. And Dostoevsky’s Alyosha experiences a similar sensation as he looks atthe stars: ‘there seemed to be threads from all those innumerable worlds of God,linking his soul to them’; he flings himself, weeping, on his knees, to kiss theearth.Yet all that has happened—to Janine, to Constance Chatterley, to AlyoshaKaramazov—is that they have walked out of the prison inside their own heads, toconfront the reality of the world. William Blake writes:> Five windows light the cavern’d Man: thro’ one he breathes the air;> Thro’ one hears music of the spheres; thro’ one the eternal vine> Flourishes, that he may receive the grapes; thro’ one can look> And see small portions of the eternal world that ever groweth;> Thro’ one himself pass out what time he please; but he will not,> For stolen joys are sweet, & bread eaten in secret pleasant.If the ‘five windows’ refer to the senses, then the passage is incomprehensible,since it implies that we can walk outside our senses, and we know this to beimpossible. But what Blake actually means is that man lives in a cave inside hisown head, yet he does not have to. He can ‘pass out what time he please’. He can‘snap out’ of the dream-like state, and reassert his sense of reality.The comment about ‘bread eaten in secret’ is equally puzzling unless werecognize that Blake is speaking about the dream-like state in which we spendmost of our time. Provided the daydreams are pleasant, the cave inside the headis a warm and comfortable place. The danger is in allowing ourselves to mistakeit for the real world. Flaubert’s Madame Bovary and Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina arecautionary tales about women who make this mistake; both commit suicide. Tolstoyhad enough insight to make Anna wake up as she is about to be killed by a train,and recognize that this is preposterous—that death is the last thing she wants.But how is it possible that even the most habitual daydreamer could do anythingas absurd as committing suicide? Children, of course, find it easy to sink intostates of black depression—particularly imaginative children—because theirknowledge of the world is so small that they habitually turn molehills intomountains. But surely the stupidest and most self-absorbed adult ought to knowbetter? And the answer, once again, is that the astonishing pace of humanevolution is to blame. More than any other animal, we have the power to focusupon particulars; we possess a kind of mental microscope which enables us tonarrow down our attention to a single problem. A microscope can make a flea lookas big as a horse. It can also turn a minor annoyance into a major catastrophe.Once we enter the state of adulthood, we spend so large a proportion of ourlives dealing with problems that we forget their actual scale. We forget to takeour eye away from the microscope. To use a slightly different analogy: it is asif we possessed a pair of reading glasses—for close-up work—and a pair oflong-distance glasses. We get so used to wearing the reading glasses that weforget to remove them when we go out for a walk, and find ourselves peeringshort-sightedly at the scenery.Then some crisis—or moment of delighted anticipation—reminds us that we ought tobe wearing the long-distance glasses. And the moment we put them on, weexperience a revelation. Everything becomes clear and real. All petty anxietiesdrop from our shoulders. We feel like laughing aloud. Suddenly, it becomesobvious that all the miseries and anxieties were a stupid mistake, due to thewrong glasses. There is a feeling of relaxation and happiness that seems toexpress itself in the words: ‘Of course!’But ‘of course’ what? If we could answer that question we would have solved oneof the most basic problems of human development.And the starting-point must be the ‘glimpse of reality’. T. E. Lawrencedescribes a typical one in Seven Pillars of Wisdom: ‘We started out on one ofthose clear dawns that wake up the senses with the sun, while the intellect,tired after the thinking of the night, was yet abed. For an hour or two, on sucha morning, the sounds, scents, and colours of the world struck man individuallyand directly, not filtered through or made typical by thought: they seemed toexist sufficiently by themselves...’This is the sensation we experience after an illness, when we first begin toconvalesce. The heart seems to be wide-open to experience, and, as Lawrencesays, we no longer filter it through our critical mechanism. It is the feelingwe sometimes get on the first day of a holiday. Reality comes flooding inthrough the senses, and it has upon us the same effect as food on an emptystomach.One of the most important discoveries of recent decades is the one for whichRoger Sperry has received the Nobel Prize: the recognition that this ‘criticalmechanism’ is located in the left side of the brain, while the mechanism thatenables us to ‘appreciate’ reality is located in the right. Of the two cerebralhemispheres—the parts of the brain that press against the top of the skull—theleft deals with language and reason, the right deals with feeling and intuition.(For some reason that is still not understood, the left brain controls the rightside of the body, with all its muscles, and the right brain controls the leftside.) Looked at from above, they look like the two halves of a walnut. Sperrydiscovered that if the ‘bridge’ between the two halves is severed—as it is insome cases to cure epilepsy—the patient turns into two different persons. Oneman tried to button up his flies with his right hand (connected to the‘rational’ side of his brain) while the other hand undid them. Another patienttried to embrace his wife with one arm while the other pushed her away. Apatient who had been given some wooden blocks to arrange into a pattern (a righthemisphere activity) tried without success to do it with his right hand. Hisother hand kept trying to help, and the right kept impatiently knocking it away,as if to say: ‘Let me do this.’ Finally, he had to sit on his left hand to stopit from interfering.Now in this case, it is obvious that the left hand ought to have been given itsown way; for it is connected to the right brain, and could see the answer. Butbefore we jump to the conclusion that the right is a hero and the left avillain, we should note that the right is also at the mercy of negativeemotions. When one split-brain patient became angry with his wife, his left handtried to hit her; the other hand defended her and held the left hand tightly.The left brain, then, is the critic, the ‘restrainer’, the part of T. E.Lawrence that kept him from appreciating reality—except when he got up so earlythat the left brain was still asleep.This enables us at least to begin to explain what that ‘Of course!’ means.‘You’, the ego, live in your left brain. When we say that man is the onlycreature who spends 99 per cent of his time inside his own head, we mean, infact, inside his left cerebral hemisphere. And in the basement of the lefthemisphere is the library full of filing cabinets—the stuffy room that wemistake for reality. In Heartbreak House, Hector asks Shotover: ‘How long dareyou concentrate on a feeling without risking having it fixed in yourconsciousness all the rest of your life?’, and Shotover answers an hour and ahalf. We all know what he means. Obsessions get stuck in our heads. We broodupon past experience like a cow chewing the cud, regurgitating it and chewing ityet again. Finally, the experience has become shrunken and tasteless, like anold piece of chewing gum. And yet we still mistake it for the real thing.It is upon the basis of this dry, tasteless experience that we base our majordecisions on life. If I am asked whether I would like to go to the theatre onSaturday night, I recall previous visits to the theatre, try to remember whatthey were like, and say yes or no on the basis of those faded memories. Worsestill, confronted by some tiresome problem, I remember the last time I had todeal with a similar problem, and my energies drain away; I feel exhausted anddepressed before I have even started. And this ‘assessment’ is made uponcompletely false data—a tasteless piece of chewing gum.Yet we make this mistake habitually, all the way through our lives—habituallyundermining our own vitality.This is why that ‘glimpse of reality’ makes us say: ‘Of course!’ We have seenthrough the error—the mistake that has caused a constant leak of energy, thathas stolen so much of our happiness, that has prevented us from achieving afraction of what we might have achieved.This brings another interesting recognition. For more than two thousand years,philosophers have been producing gloomy and negative assessments of humanexistence: Ecclesiastes says there is nothing new under the sun and that life isvanity; the Buddha says it is all illusion; Aristotle says it is better not tohave been born. Very few philosophers seem to have much good to say about life.Because these men are great thinkers, we are inclined to take their word for it.Yet now we see that thinking has its own limitations: the limitations of theleft brain. No doubt Ecclesiastes and Aristotle thought they were takingeverything into account; but they had left out precisely 50 percent of humanexistence. They were mistaking an old piece of chewing gum for the real thing.It is true that many philosophers—particularly among the mystics—have warned usagainst the danger of mistaking thought for reality. And in the past century,writers as different as Walt Whitman, G.K. Chesterton, D.H. Lawrence, AldousHuxley and Henry Miller have repeated the message. But there is usuallysomething oddly unsatisfying about these disciples of instinct and intuition.They seem to offer a poor second best. D.H. Lawrence fulminated against ‘headconsciousness’ and advised us to trust the solar plexus; but his work offers noclear advice on what to do. In a sense, he is as pessimistic as the ‘thinking’philosophers; some of his stories seem to suggest that man would be better offif he was born as a horse or a fox. Walt Whitman envied the cows because theywere uncomplaining. But what we want to understand is the secret potentialitiesof consciousness. Rejecting the left brain in favour of the right is obviouslyno solution. I do not feel that human beings have made a mistake in evolvingleft-brain consciousness. For all its problems and anxieties, I still prefer thecondition of being human to being a cow. What we need to know is how to gobeyond left-brain consciousness.The right-brainers, like the left-brainers, have left something important out ofaccount. What? We can see the answer if we think again of Meursault’s experienceof the ‘benign indifference of the universe’, of Janine’s experience of theAfrican night, of Alyosha Karamazov’s desire to kiss the earth. This is notsimply a glimpse of the external reality. It is an internal reality that hasopened up. Hesse expresses it with beautiful clarity in Steppenwolf, anothernovel about a man who finds himself trapped and suffocated in left-brainconsciousness. At the end of a frustrating day he goes to a tavern to eat anddrink; the wine causes a sudden relaxation into right-brain consciousness: ‘Arefreshing laughter rose in me...It soared aloft like a soap bubble...and thensoftly burst...The golden trail was blazed, and I was reminded of the eternal,and of Mozart and the stars. For an hour I could breathe once more...’ Thelaughter is the equivalent of the ‘of course’ feeling; we always want to laughaloud when tension gives way to relaxation. But what is important here is thephrase ‘reminded of the eternal, and of Mozart and the stars’. There was nothingto stop him thinking about Mozart and the stars at any time of the day. But heis referring not to thinking, but to a feeling of the reality of Mozart and thestars. It is as if an inner trapdoor had opened, leading into an immenseAladdin’s cave.What, then, has happened? In effect, Steppenwolf has brought his right and lefthemispheres into alignment. He has relaxed into right-brain consciousness.Another important observation made by scientists examining the differencesbetween right and left is that the left is obsessed by time; the right seems tohave little sense of time. This seems reasonable, since logic and language havea lineal and serial structure—like a chain—while patterns spread out sideways,so to speak. The left brain tends to hurry forward, its eyes fixed on thefuture, while the right strolls along with its hands in its pockets, enjoyingthe scenery. They are like two trains running on parallel tracks, but atdifferent speeds. If the right can be persuaded to move faster, by working itinto a state of excitement (as, for example, with exciting music), then the twotrains can run side by side, and the passengers can lean out of the windows andtalk to one another. The same effect can be achieved if the left can bepersuaded to move slower. This is what Steppenwolf has done as he relaxes withhis glass of wine. Hence the sudden feeling of reality.So one of the main functions of the right brain is to add a dimension of realityto our experience. The world as seen by left-brain consciousness is flat,two-dimensional, little more than a sketch. The business of the right brain isto add a third dimension. It is this recognition of reality that brings thefeeling of relief, the sense that ‘all is well’. As absurd as it sounds, we livemost of our lives upon the assumption that reality is unreal—two dimensional. Wefeel that it is flat, boring, too easily known. But when the right brain beginsto do its proper work, we recognize the absurdity of this assumption: that theworld is infinitely richer and more meaningful than the left can grasp.This provides us with our first major clue to the solution of this problem. Evenif the left cannot see the world as full of potentiality, it can hold on to themoments of insight and refuse to let go of them. If I know that presentdifficulties will end in triumph, I am un-discourageable; I merely have to knowit intellectually. And if I can ‘know’ that reality actually has a thirddimension, I shall never fall into the mistake of complaining that there isnothing new under the sun and that life is futile.This is a point of considerable importance. So much of the literature of thepast century has been concerned with boredom and frustration. Artsybashev wrotea novel called Breaking Point about a dull Russian town in which practicallyeverybody commits suicide. He was arguing, in effect, that when life is seenwithout illusions, the only courageous decision is to refuse to go on. We cansee the absurdity of the mistake. His characters lack sense of purpose, so theyhave become trapped in left-brain consciousness, which dehydrates the world ofmeaning. They have forgotten the trapdoor that leads into inner worlds.This tendency to become trapped in left-brain consciousness is perhaps thegreatest single danger that threatens us as a species. Every year, thousands ofpeople commit suicide because they believe ‘that is all there is’—they thinkthis two-dimensional world of our everyday experience is the only reality. Allmental illness is caused by the same assumption, which can be compared with theassumption of savages that an eclipse of the sun could mean the end of theworld. A savage who knew the real cause of an eclipse might still experience acertain irrational anxiety as the sun became dark; but his basic attitude to theexperience would be relaxed and rational. And if human beings could grasp thisinsight about right-brain consciousness, mental illness would finally become asrare as leprosy.As soon as we glimpse this possibility of a balanced left-and-rightconsciousness, we can see it as the beginning of a whole range of newdevelopments in human consciousness. Consider, for example, what happens when Iread a novel. To some extent, I enter the world of the novelist; yet because myleft brain is doing most of the work, scanning and interpreting the words, myexperience of that mental world is only superficial. I can recall certain booksI read in childhood—Dickens’s A Christmas Carol and The Old Curiosity Shop, theopening chapters of The Count of Monte Cristo, Conan Doyle’s Lost World and theSherlock Holmes stories, Rider Haggard’s She and Cleopatra—which made me feel asif I had entered a state of trance; I was living in the world of the book ratherthan in the ‘real’ world. My mind supplied that fictional world with smells andcolours and tastes. In short, my right brain did its proper work of adding athird dimension of reality to the book.Neither is it a matter of becoming absorbed in certain characters and events infiction. I have slipped into that same state of total absorption when readingWhitehead’s Science and the Modern World and William James’s Varieties ofReligious Experience. The right brain can add this same element of reality toideas.So the ‘filing cabinet’ inside the head is only part of the story. Whenconsulted by the left brain, the cabinet may appear to contain only sheets ofpaper. But when the right brain can be persuaded to play its part, these sheetscan be transformed by some alchemy into a living reality.This enables us to see precisely what is wrong with those writers who areprophets of instinct, like D.H. Lawrence and Henry Miller. They may appreciateliterature, yet they feel that books are ‘just words’, a kind of game thatshould not be confused with reality. But when a book is transformed by the rightbrain, it becomes another kind of reality, with claims to equality with the‘real world’.This is why the past two centuries or so have been some of the most exciting inhuman intellectual history. In 1719, a political pamphleteer named Daniel Defoeproduced Robinson Crusoe, and seven years later, Jonathan Swift publishedGulliver’s Travels. Defoe meant Crusoe to be a piece of realistic journalism—itwas based upon the true story of a shipwrecked mariner—and Swift intendedGulliver as political satire. In fact, both had created a kind of magic carpetthat could carry the reader off into the realms of imagination. In 1740 cameSamuel Richardson’s Pamela, the first novel actually written as an exercise inpure invention (or ‘escapism’ as we might now say), which created a sensationall over Europe. Until this time, the favourite recreational reading of boredhousewives had been volumes of sermons—for the sermon, with its anecdotes andexhortations, also provided a higher vantage point from which one’s own lifecould be surveyed. But as a magic carpet, the novel was as superior to thesermon as a jet plane is to the old-fashioned airship. In a few decades, Englandbecame a nation of avid readers; the same thing happened all over the civilizedworld. Bored housewives had gained ‘access to inner worlds’. Caught up in thesad destiny of Clarissa Harlowe or young Werther, they could transform merewords into a living reality by adding the weight of their own experience.The experience altered the mind of civilized man. Defoe, Swift, Addison,Johnson, Montesquieu were of a generation of realists. They were succeeded by ageneration of dreamers, who placed feeling and desire above convention and duty.And a curious thing happened. Man suddenly noticed that nature was beautiful.Earlier generations had regarded mountains as impressive but inconvenient. Thesenew romantics saw in them a reflection of their own inner mountain landscape.Nature was exciting because it reflected man’s new sense of his ownpotentialities:> To horse!—way o’er hill and steep!> Into the saddle blithe I sprung;> The eve was cradling earth to sleep,> And night upon the mountain hung.> With robes of mist around him set,> The oak like some huge giant stood,> While with its hundred eyes of jet> Peered darkness from the tangled wood.This is the young Goethe, and it conveys the excitement of a young man settingout to ride to his mistress. Poets like Goethe, Schiller, Byron, Shelley,Pushkin, seemed to have glimpsed new possibilities of freedom for the humanspirit.Then why did disillusion set in? Partly for the same reason that earlyexperiments in flying ended in crashes. The romantics were too inexperienced toknow how to handle this sense of freedom. Many of them thought themselves freeto seduce any number of young ladies with a good conscience, then foundthemselves in violent conflict with their sense of human decency. Otherspreferred to escape boredom with the use of drugs and alcohol. Overtaken byphysical and emotional reactions, most of them concluded that the vision offreedom had been a delusion—in which case, human life is futile and tragic. Withits unprecedentedly high rate of suicide and early death, the romanticexperiment was finally accounted a failure.Yet a new generation of romantics—Dostoevsky, Mann, Hesse, Shaw, Yeats—began tounderstand that freedom can only be achieved through self-discipline. Dostoevskyachieved his vision of freedom when he believed he was about to die in front ofa firing squad, and became aware of something that earlier romantics had onlyglimpsed in flashes: that the real trouble with human beings is that wehabitually exaggerate our feelings. A man who thinks he is about to be shotrealizes with absolute certainty that most of the problems that have made himmiserable are unutterably trivial; if he could only get a second chance, hecould guarantee never to be unhappy for the rest of his life.Experiences of this type always bring the same insight. We make the habitualassumption that we consist of a mind and a body. But there is another kind ofbody: the emotional body. For practical purposes, my feelings and emotionsconstitute a separate entity. And this is what makes life so difficult. Theemotional body wastes an enormous amount of my time with its damned feelings.The sun goes behind a cloud and I feel gloomy. Somebody fails to reply when Iask a question, and I feel rejected. I trip over the pavement and feelaccident-prone. I miss a bus and feel unlucky. I open my bank statement and feelapprehensive. I remember something I have forgotten to do and feelguilt-stricken. Nearly all these ‘feelings’ are negative. When the sun comes outfrom behind a cloud, I usually fail to notice it. When my bank statement shows acredit balance, I take it for granted. When I catch a bus, I am usually thinkingabout something else. So on the whole, the emotional body is a dreary bore,groaning at my failures and undervaluing my successes.When some crisis awakens my sense of urgency, I suddenly realize how easy itwould be to discipline the emotional body, and tell it to keep its stupidfeelings to itself. How? That question can be answered by anyone who casts hismind back to such a situation. A real emergency has the effect of ‘stiffeningthe sinews’, arousing ‘vital reserves’. Minor anxieties are instantly suppressedwith a mental gesture that is rather like compressing a spring. With thatthreatening gesture, they instantly subside, like a whining child who realizeshe has gone too far and that the heavy hand is about to descend.This explains one of the minor mysteries of human psychology: why we go out ofour way to look for challenges. Why should anybody want to become a Member ofParliament or the chairman of a sub-committee? Why, for that matter, shouldanyone want to climb a mountain? The old explanation, ‘because it’s there’, isno answer. But every challenge arouses in us the kind of vital energy necessaryfor bullying the emotional body into silence. It sits on our shoulders, like theOld Man of the Sea with his legs wrapped around Sinbad’s neck, slowly choking usto death—until an emergency arises. Then, with a single jerk, we throw him off.And suddenly, we can breathe again. Unfortunately, we do not follow Sinbad’slead, and beat out his brains while he lies on the ground. We forget him, andallow him to sneak back as soon as our thoughts are elsewhere...The first thing we observe when the Old Man has been unseated is that lifebecomes far richer and more exciting. The Old Man’s task, apparently, is to tryto make us tired of life by keeping us entangled in triviality. He keeps onreacting to every minor problem as if it was the end of the world, and finallyhe convinces us that life is one long series of dreary obstacles. My only realally against him is my reason, my ability to tell myself: ‘Don’t be stupid—thisis not important.’ If the Old Man can persuade someone to commit suicide, he hasscored a real triumph.Conversely, a man who had achieved what the Buddha called‘enlightenment’—permanent freedom from the Old Man—would live in an unwaveringstate of serene intensity. In this state, the external world is seen to beendlessly fascinating because, like a mirror, it reflects the immense depths ofthe internal world.The past two centuries have been one of the most important periods in humanhistory. For the first time, large numbers of human beings have been freed fromthe pressing involvement with physical reality. They have learned that it is notsimply entanglement in mere physical process. Life lived under these conditionsis basically futile and repetitive. We begin to live only when we learn todescend into ourselves as a coal miner is transported deep into the earth.But how? How do we begin to go about making the descent?The story I now propose to tell is of a man who stumbled accidentally on the‘trick’, and whose life has been totally transformed by it."},{"pageContent":"2—TEN DAYS IN VIITTAKIVISome time in 1980, a Finnish correspondent, Matti Veijola, wrote to ask mewhether I would be interested in attending a seminar in Finland for ten days inthe summer of 1981. I had only once been to Finland—in 1960, on my way toLeningrad, and I had been impressed by my glimpses of its lakes and pineforests. For me, Finland meant the symphonies of Sibelius and the songs ofKilpinen, and that extraordinary novel by Alexis Kivi called Seven Brothers. Theidea of an extended visit sounded pleasant, particularly since I could take myfamily.In fact, the holiday—in the August of 1981—came at exactly the right time. I hadjust completed the hardest four months work of my whole life. I had beencommissioned to write a book on the poltergeist, with a delivery date of 30June; and by the end of January I had finished the basic research and was readyto start typing. At this point, another publisher asked me if I would like toprovide the text of an illustrated book on witchcraft, a subject I already knewreasonably well. Then Reader’s Digest asked me if I could write them a shortnovel about Rasputin, of whom I had once written a biographical study. The termswere tempting, and since writers are habitually short of cash, I accepted bothoffers, assuming that the publisher of Poltergeist would allow me a couple ofextra months for delivery of the typescript. I was mistaken. They had scheduledthe book for autumn publication; an editor was waiting to get to work on it themoment it arrived, and to rush it to the printer. So it looked as if I had towrite three books in four months. The prospect made my heart sink. The book onwitchcraft would not be too difficult, since the text had to be written insections—which meant there were no problems of construction. But a novel maysimply refuse to go in the right direction, and have to be started again fromthe beginning. (For twenty-five years now I have been writing a novel calledLulu, and must have started it a hundred times.) Yet I couldn’t afford todiscard a single day’s writing. The same was true of the poltergeist book;120,000 words in eight weeks meant 15,000 words a week, or ten pages everysingle day, with no time for revision. Moreover, poltergeists are singularlyrepetitive creatures, behaving like disembodied football hooligans; I was notsure how I was going to spin out their boringly predictable activities for120,000 words—this was a hurdle I would have to take when I came to it.The very thought of all that non-stop typing, without time for relaxation, mademe feel trapped. In 1973, I had been under similar pressure, and had begun toexperience ‘panic attacks’—bouts of sudden fear and intense depression. I hadstruggled my way out of these with common sense and a certain amount ofself-analysis. Now the old sensations of unease began to return—a feeling I call‘the burning-rubber smell’—as if the brakes are beginning to smoulder. On themorning when I received the letter saying Poltergeist had to be delivered ontime, I had been to see my doctor; he told me I was suffering from high bloodpressure and had to lose two stone in weight. He also arranged an appointmentwith a specialist about a problem of internal bleeding that sounded ominouslylike cancer. When I got back from the doctor, I went to my desk to write aboutthe burning and torture of the Bamberg witches; as I wrote I began to experiencea ‘sinking’ sensation, accompanied by the old feeling of panic. In such moments,it suddenly seems that the floor of our sanity is very frail, and might collapselike thin ice. There is a feeling of energy draining away, and a suspicion thatlife is a battle that has been lost in advance. I forced myself to go and lookfor a reference book that I needed—although the action seemed meaningless—andstood in front of the bookcase, struggling with the sinking sensation. It waslike trying not to be sick. Then I went back to my typewriter, gritted my teethagainst the sense of misery and futility, and went on writing. At some point, Ihad to lean forward to pick up something I had dropped on the floor. Quitesuddenly, the oppression vanished—as abruptly as the sun coming out from behinda cloud. With an almost dizzy feeling of astonishment and triumph, I realizedthat my emotions had been ‘trying it on’, having a tantrum, and that they hadsuddenly decided to give up. And at once I saw with great clarity that humanbeings possess two bodies. One is the physical body, the other—just as real,just as self-contained—is the emotional body. Like the physical body, theemotional body reaches a certain level of growth, and then stops. But it stopsrather sooner than the physical body. So most of us possess the emotional bodyof a retarded adolescent. And as soon as we find ourselves under pressure, assoon as life begins to look difficult, the emotional body bursts into tears andtries to run away.That insight was a turning-point. But since I had four months of non-stopwriting ahead of me, and the anxieties about my physical condition, that was notthe end of the matter. I lay awake for hours at night, trying to stop thepounding of my heart, and to resist thoughts that dragged me into depression. Iknew that my salvation lay in that thread of pure will, the determination not togive way; yet there was always a fear that the thread might eventually snapunder the strain. I finished the 50,000 words on witchcraft in just over amonth, and felt a certain irritation when the publisher told me that he hadoverestimated the space available and would have to cut out 10,000 words—a wholeweek’s work. I settled down to the Rasputin novel, which fortunately went wellfor the first hundred pages, although there were days when I felt so low that Icould eat only the occasional digestive biscuit. Halfway through, it was clearthat I wasn’t going to succeed in compressing his life into 60,000 words—I hadalready done 40,000, and hadn’t even got him as far as StPetersburg...Eventually I finished it on time, 15,000 words too long—leavingReader’s Digest the problem of cutting—and on the day after I typed the lastparagraph, began Poltergeist. Again, the gods were with me. New information, newideas, turned up at exactly the right moment. I was well behind schedule, butthe publisher told me that if I could deliver most of the book by the agreeddate, I could have another fortnight to write the final chapter. I began toexperience a sort of grim exhilaration as I forced myself into the final gallop.I finished the book with several days to spare, and then went on to write sixarticles for a magazine of which I am advisory editor. At the end of the fourmonths, I had the satisfaction of calculating that I had written a quarter of amillion words, the length of Joyce’s Ulysses.A week later we set out for Finland—Joy, myself, and our two boys Damon andRowan. At last I had time to take stock. My most powerful ally in the previousfour months had been my power of reason. My emotions had staged a full-scalerevolt, trying to convince me that if I pressed on at this pace, the resultwould be nervous breakdown. My body, on the whole, had behaved rather better, inspite of the high blood pressure and the blood in my urine that made me suspectcancer (it turned out to be nothing worse than a broken vein). What was mostimportant was a recognition—to which I shall return in the last chapter—that ifI could drag myself out of a state of fatigue and depression into ‘normality’,then there was no reason why I should not drag myself out of normality into astate of far higher energy and intensity. We have, in fact, far greater controlover our inner being than we realize. The answer lay in developing a certainpower of realism, of objectivity. When we experience moods of fatigue ordepression, it only takes some real crisis or danger to show us that thedepression was sheer self-indulgence. If we could simply hold fast to thisvision—which reason tells us to be true—we would never again be victimized byour emotions.But the hard truth is that this control can only be achieved by confronting theemotions head-on and bullying them into submission. In the Seven Pillars,Lawrence describes how, after a halt in the desert, they realized that one oftheir number was missing. Lawrence turned his camel and went back to search. Butthe camel disliked leaving the main group, and kept trying to turn back;Lawrence had to force it to go on. Throughout the first half of 1981, myemotions had behaved like Lawrence’s camel every time I sat down at mytypewriter. And I now had the satisfaction of having taught the camel a degreeof obedience.We drove to London airport on the day Prince Charles was married, and the radiobabbled endlessly about the ecstatic crowds; it was impossible to find out whatwas happening elsewhere in the world. At the Post House Hotel they even offeredus a slice of wedding cake, to the surprise of our smallest boy, who speculatedthat it must have been enormous. The following day we flew to Helsinki.The bearded man who met us at the barrier had a slight American accent and aquiet manner; he introduced himself as Brad Absetz, one of the teachers atViittakivi. When I asked where he’d parked the car, he explained that Viittakivididn’t have a car—so we had a four-stage journey ahead of us: by bus intoHelsinki, by train to Hameenlinna, by bus to Hauho, then by taxi to Viittakivi.It is a measure of how far I had succeeded in controlling my sense of boredomthat I accepted all this without an inward groan.In Helsinki, with an hour to wait for the train, we went to a tea shop. It was acuriously old-fashioned place—a small room that looked liked a Victorianparlour, with a bird cage hanging from the wall; on a table, in the centre ofthe room stood a huge cake-stand with all kinds of sticky pastries; we helpedourselves and took our tea over to the curtained window. I could imagine thatthis place had looked exactly the same at the time of Ibsen and Strindberg.While we drank tea, Brad told us more about the Viittakivi centre. It soundednot unlike the Esalen Institute near San Francisco, except that at Viittakivithe subjects ranged from world religions to organic farming. It had been foundedby American Quakers after the war, in association with the Finnish SettlementFederation; this explained how an American like Brad had come to be involved.On that first meeting, Brad did not strike me as in any way unusual—certainlynot the kind of person about whom I might want to write a book. I found himrelaxed and easy to talk to, and in some subtle way definitely not the type ofAmerican that I had met at Esalen—serious-minded students of Zen and GroupTherapy. But he was not the kind of person you would notice in a crowd. The mainthing that struck me about him was that he seemed to be at ease and at peace,like a man sitting in front of his own fireside. He made me think of thatearlier generation of Americans, like Henry James and Henry Adams, who had cometo Europe looking for a sense of the historical past. If that was what Brad waslooking for, he seemed to have found it.The train pulled out of the station, past the harbour, and we were soon in theopen countryside. There is something very soothing in the green, flat Finnishlandscape, with its wooden houses and glimpses of water between the trees. As wesat in the restaurant car, drinking watery beer, I experienced suddenly thatcurious sense of satisfaction that can only be described in the words ‘beingwhere you are’. That sounds absurd only until we reflect that for most of ourlives we are not where we are. I am walking down a lane in Cornwall, but only mybody is there; my mind is ‘elsewhere.’ It is not in any particular place; it isjust ‘not all there’—a phrase we also use for the mentally defective. And then,beyond a certain point of relaxation, it happens. The left brain slows down;suddenly, it is walking in step with the right. And you are there, in thepresent moment, wholly and completely. You can taste the flavour of your ownconsciousness.Casually, I asked Brad whether he had ever done any writing—the kind of politequestion you ask a travelling companion on a long journey. He said: ‘I oncewrote some poems’—the kind of answer you expect from a travelling companion youknow to be literate. Then, after a pause, he added: ‘If you could say I wrotethem.’Oddly enough, I knew immediately what he meant. ‘Who did, then?’‘I suppose you could say they wrote themselves.’I said: ‘The right brain?’Brad looked at me curiously; but it was no time to open a conversation onsplit-brain physiology, with the children asking what was the Finnish for‘potato crisps’. And, unlike most poets, Brad did not seem anxious to pursue thesubject. I said: ‘I’d be interested to see them some time,’ and we talked ofother things.Viittakivi stands in the midst of thick woodland, at the end of a lake thatstretches for many miles. (In Finland there are so many interconnected lakesthat it is possible to row for days.) Although it was late July, there wasalready a tang of autumn in the air—winter comes early that far north. Theleaves were turning gold, and through the still air, you could hear a dogbarking several miles away. The only drawback in this paradise is themosquitoes—but Brad assured me they were scarce this year. (They seem to havethe same power as vampire bats, of being able to feed unnoticed on their host—Iwatched one of them settle on the neck of Jormma (Brad’s teacher-colleague) andmake a three-course meal while he talked on unaware.)Our chalet was comfortable, with a balcony that overlooked the lake. After someinitial confusion—the taxi driver had absent-mindedly gone off with a casecontaining the children’s pyjamas—we settled down to a cold supper. The onlyobvious drawback to the place was that it was ‘dry’; alcohol was not actuallyforbidden; but there was none available on the premises, and the nearest stateliquor store that sold wine was twenty miles away. I thought longingly about themagnums of Beaujolais I had seen at Heathrow, and had decided against buyingbecause of the weight...When we finally retired to bed, I lay awake for hours,made uneasy by the total stillness.Breakfast was at eight; but since this was six o’clock London time, we decidedto sleep late and make do with coffee and biscuits. The day was soft and grey.Since the first seminar was not being held until the afternoon, we caught thebus into Hauho, the nearest village, which is about five miles away. It islittle more than a few shops, supermarkets and houses scattered around across-roads; unlike English villages, Finnish hamlets are mostly as nondescriptas filling stations. In fact, most of Finland has an impressive air of order andneatness, as if run by an army of hard-working housewives. This intimidating airof efficiency is softened by the green, empty landscape, and the low volume oftraffic on the roads; the country still seems to belong to the trees and birds.We bought groceries and cans of beer, went and looked at the church, and found ataxi that got us back in time for lunch. All meals in Viittakivi areself-service, and proved to be excellent. I grew particularly fond of a hard ryebiscuit, as brittle as a sheet of ice, and of a kind of peanut butter betterthan any I have had in England or America.Now it was time for work. While my family went boating on the lake, I attendedthe opening seminar, which took place in the large hall above the dining-room.It was a pleasant place, with huge windows looking out over the lake and forest.There were forty or fifty students, ranging in age from mid-teens tomid-seventies. And, apart from regular lectures involving all the students,there would be five study groups under particular individuals, one being myself.Brad opened the proceedings with a short speech about the importance of beingtogether and getting to know one another. From anyone else it would have soundedtrite; but Brad had a quiet air of meaning every word he said. He felt we werethere to try to reduce the distance between individuals, to try to become a kindof family. After this, every student introduced himself and explained why he hadcome to Viittakivi—about half of them spoke in Finnish and had to be translated.I was startled when one of them, dressed in a kind of multi-coloured suit, wentand sat under the table and buried his face in his hands, peeping out atintervals and shuddering nervously; after which he stood on the table andperformed a series of balletic poses. It looked as if he was trying tocommunicate, like the man in G.K. Chesterton who keeps hopping around on oneleg; then I gathered that he was one of the group-leaders, an actor who was hereto teach us how to get rid of our inhibitions through physical movement...I am not, I have to confess, the kind of person who enjoys group activities. Mybrain tends to switch off, like a bored schoolboy in a class. In the wrong mood,I would have found all this exasperating. But the past six months had made mevery aware that boredom is more to do with the person who is bored rather thanof the person who is doing the boring. We are too mechanical, and allow certainstimuli to hypnotize us into passivity. So I deliberately refused to let myattention wander, and found that I was becoming increasingly interested in thesepeople and their motives. It is true that I had seen it all before, in similarworkgroups in England and America: all the serious-minded people who feel thatcivilization is too impersonal, that capitalism is shameful, and that allgovernments are rather wicked. In fact, we had a number of extreme leftists andtrade unionists among us, and they seemed to take it for granted that we allagreed that the rich must somehow be forced to surrender their ill-gotten gains.Yet there was an air of good humour about their idealism that made me feel theywould not be too offended if I admitted that I regard socialists as well-meaningbut muddle-headed brigands.After an interminable amount of discussion—everybody wanted to talk—we finallyworked out separate ‘themes’ for the work groups: creativity, society andresponsibility (most of the leftists joined that one), self-expression throughmovement, and so on. My own group was concerned with the theme of inner freedom.The following morning, I lectured to the whole student body for ninety minutes,and this was followed by two hours of discussion. Their stamina seemed to betremendous. I was reminded of that story told by Berdyaev, of how a group in StPetersburg had stayed up until four o’clock one morning discussing the universe;when someone suggested it was time to go to bed, someone else said: ‘No, wecan’t go to bed yet—we haven’t decided whether God exists.’ Our discussion wasmainly political. I had finally decided I should nail my political colours tothe mast rather than try to avoid discord; so I began by explaining how I hadceased to be a socialist after I wrote a book about Bernard Shaw which defendedthe socialist position. (When I re-read my own book in print, I saw that thearguments for socialism were nonsense.) I went on to speak about the animal needfor territory, and pointed out that Proudhon was unaware of this fundamentalurge when he formulated the principle that property is theft. To my surprise, alarge number of people nodded enthusiastically—evidently I had been mistaken tosuppose they were all leftists. The trade unionists, to do them justice,listened politely, but evidently felt that I had failed to understand theirideal of human brotherhood. And in the afternoon, I listened with equalpoliteness while three young leftists made stirring speeches about all thethings that are obviously wrong with society, and how easy it would be to putthem right if only people would refuse to obey authority. Again, most of theaudience nodded enthusiastically, and I concluded that they had an unusualcapacity for empathy.Yet even my total disagreement with these ideas began to seem fruitful. Thestresses of the past months had taught me not to ‘give way’ to feelings ofimpatience and boredom. It was interesting to find that I could listen to ideasthat struck me as naive with detachment, even with sympathy. They simply made memore aware that the basic hunger of human beings is for a certain inner freedom.Leftists make the assumption that it can be achieved through political reform,rather as a sexually inexperienced person imagines that losing your virginitycompletely transforms your life. And the clear recognition that they weremistaken made me aware of the precise nature of this inner freedom. I tried toexplain it the following morning, in the first session of our work group. Therewere seven or eight of us, including Jormma, who had come along to translate.Most of the group spoke English (indeed, two were Americans), but one lady spokeonly Finnish and Swedish. I found the prospect of non-stop translationdiscouraging, but it proved to have its advantages. It meant that I had to speakslowly, clearly and precisely, and that everyone had a chance to reconsider itas it was translated.I began by explaining Husserl’s recognition that all perception is‘intentional’, that when we see something, we have to reach out and grasp it,just like picking up an object in the hand. But this act of ‘grasping’ hasbecome unconscious—or rather, subconscious, hovering in the twilight betweenconscious and unconscious. From childhood on, we imagine that happiness is dueto circumstances—holidays, Christmas, unexpected pleasures, and so on. In fact,the holiday only stimulates perception, so you ‘grasp’ twice as hard as usual.The result is that feeling of reality, intensity. If we could deliberatelyre-programme the unconscious mind to make twice as much effort, we could achieveintensity at will.As I write these words, they seem to me to say exactly what I mean, and toexpress one of the most important truths human beings are capable of grasping.But most of the group were only able to half-grasp my meaning. I felt theirritating sense of non-communication that I often feel after lecturing. Thatnight, I lay awake for hours wondering how I could overcome their mistrust ofthe words—make them see straight to the reality behind the words. They wanted to‘do’, not listen. And so the next day, I taught them a basic ‘trick’ forinducing deeper intentionality, the ‘pen trick’.Sudden crises cause the mind to ‘contract’, and when the danger vanishes, weexpand with a feeling of relief. Graham Greene produced this effect by playingRussian roulette with his brother’s revolver—pointing the loaded gun at hishead, spinning the chambers and pulling the trigger. When there was just aclick, he felt immense relief. ‘It was as if a light had been turned on...and Ifelt that life contained an infinite number of possibilities.’ This demonstratesthe basic principle: that if the senses can contract violently, and then relaxand expand, the result is a sense of relief, and a perception of the objectivevalue of being alive.Russian roulette is a dangerous way of causing this ‘contraction’. It can beaccomplished with less risk. One simple method is to take a pen or pencil, andhold it up against a blank wall or ceiling. Now concentrate on the pen as if itis the most important thing in the world. Then allow your senses to relax, soyou see the pen against the background of the wall. Concentrate again. Relaxagain. Keep on doing this until you become aware of the ability to focus theattention at will. You will find that this unaccustomed activity of the will istiring; it produces a sense of strain behind the eyes. My own experience is thatif you persist, in spite of the strain, the result is acute discomfort, followedby a sudden immense relief—the ‘peak experience’. The result is lessspectacular—because less dangerous—than Greene’s Russian roulette, but it is, insome ways, more interesting, for we become aware that we can alter ourperceptions with an act of will. They are not just something that ‘happens tous’.Having explained this, and watched them practising the ‘pen trick’ for tenminutes or so, I was reminded of another exercise for the focusing ofperception: Wilhelm Reich’s breathing exercise. Reich made his patients lie onthe floor, and take a deep breath; then they had to exhale slowly, allowing theout-going relaxation to move from the lungs, to the stomach, then down to thegenitals. They had to repeat, as they did this: ‘Out, down, through.’ I haddescribed the exercise in my book on Reich, and occasionally practised it when Iwanted to relax; but I had never regarded it as particularly important, as Reichdid. Now, on impulse, I asked my group to lie down on the floor, and accustomthemselves to ‘Reichian breathing’ for five minutes or so. Then, at the end ofthat time, I asked them to raise their pens, stare at them, and combine theReichian breathing with the ‘pen trick’. I did this with them, and immediatelyunderstood that I had stumbled upon an interesting discovery. The breathingexercise induces deep relaxation and a sense of physical well-being. The penexercise induces a sense of concentration and control. The two should, intheory, counteract one another’s effect. But this does not happen. The controlitself somehow becomes relaxed and confident, like a baby’s breathing. After afew moments, I noticed the curious sense of exaltation, followed by a sensationas if floating out of my body. I glanced sideways at the others; all were lyingthere contentedly, obviously experiencing the same floating sensation. When thestrain of holding up the pen became too great, we rested the arm, then startedagain. Time became unimportant; when I looked at my watch I could hardly believethat we had been lying there for more than half an hour, and that no one showedthe slightest inclination to get up.I had, in fact, accidentally come across a method of ‘doing’ as well as‘knowing’. For the remainder of our seminars it proved invaluable.On most days, there were lectures as well as work groups. I attended many ofthese—on farming, education, community work, the problems of the ThirdWorld—although I seldom joined in the discussions afterwards. The truth is thatI found some of the basic assumptions so naive that they were not worth thewaste of breath. One pleasant, serious lady who had worked in Africa told usthat she had become disillusioned with Finnish education because backwardstudents lost heart when they failed to receive prizes, and so became the‘losers in society’. She looked forward to the day when there would be no moreprizes—not only in schools, but in society. Competition, she said, was wickedand ought to be abolished. I tried to envisage a world in which all competitionhas been forbidden, and conjured up an image of a city of identical houses, witheveryone dressed in grey uniforms. So I ceased to listen, and stared out of thewindow at the trees, which were distorted by the rain on the window panes. All Ihad to do was to imagine that I had just stumbled in out of a snowstorm, and wasnow relaxing in this pleasant, warm room. In moments like these, I could see thebasic problem of human existence with great clarity. We need stimulus to get thebest out of us. When no stimulus is available, we settle dully into the presentlike a boat grounded by the tide. Yet in every crisis, we can see that these‘dull’ situations should not be regarded as a misery, but as havens of peace. Weshould be able to use the imagination to recall situations of crisis, togenerate instantly the power and drive that will lift us out of boredom like arocket leaving the launching pad.Later the same afternoon, I returned from a long walk in the woods to find agreen plastic-covered notebook on my bed. Its title-page made it clear thatthese were some of the poems Brad had mentioned; he called them ‘concentrates’.I opened the book casually in the middle without any particular interest—for thepast twenty-five years I have received at least one unsolicited book ofmanuscript poems every week or two. But the first poem I read struck me aspleasingly epigrammatic:> The world is full of promise> > when I am empty of threat.> When the world is empty of threat> > I am full of the world.I had been expressing the same idea to our work group that morning: that ourinnate mistrust of the world keeps us from grasping its possibilities, and thatwhen this mistrust evaporates, because of some sudden relief, the world rushesinto our senses like air into a vacuum. Brad had said the same thing with moreconcentration. I turned the page and read:> Sadness is within me> like a creeping gray mist> > blurring the landscape> > within me,> like clinging blue smoke> rising from the fissures> > within me,> like a melancholy melody> echoing through empty chambers> > within me...The romantic melancholy was like the autumn landscape outside, with grey cloudsreflected in the lake. I poured myself a glass of wine and went on reading. Hisstyle had a pleasing simplicity:> The morning tide is out,> the beach washed clean and smooth> of even the sharply etched stepping of early birds;> the far water line> is undulating ever so slowly:> perfectly reflecting an inner seascape.> > > A lone gull> perches motionless and one-legged> > on the single log-post> that breaks the gray, still surface of the morning sea,> and stares with unblinking calm> > through the vanishing mists> > towards an outer infinity.What impressed me was that he seldom made the mistake of trying to be literary,or deliberately striking. I have never enjoyed Dylan Thomas because he seems tobe trying too hard. Brad’s ‘concentrates’ seemed effortless and sure-footed.They avoided sentimentality as easily as cleverness and display. Yet he couldwrite lines as arresting as:> The dark orchids of deadly violence> Exude a warm fragrance of sweet bloodshed.Just as a painter like Utrillo is able to capture a music of nostalgia when hepaints an empty street, so Brad seemed to be able to convey the essence of hisexperience in the barest and plainest of descriptions.But the poem that impressed me most was the longest of all—one that began:‘Following the afterimage of a wise old man within me...’. (I quote it in fullin the next chapter). Here the sense of describing an inner landscape is sostrong that the poem must have sprung out of an almost hallucinatory experience.In his autobiography Jung described how, in a period of great stress after hisbreak with Freud, he developed the curious ability to descend into his own mind,and to enter an apparently real landscape with real people—he called it ‘activeimagination’. In one of these strange waking dreams, Jung had also encountered a‘wise old man’ named Philemon, and he records his conviction that in hisconversations, ‘he said things which I had not consciously thought. For Iobserved clearly that it was he who spoke, not I.’ And this convinced Jung that‘there are things in the psyche which I do not produce’. There is in ritualmagic a technique for entering the ‘astral realms’ which seems identical withJung’s ‘active imagination’, and Yeats has described briefly his own experienceswith the method. Ouspensky also seems to have developed a similar ability, whichhe describes in A New Model of the Universe. But Brad was the first person Iactually met who seemed to have developed the same ability.A couple of hours later I met Brad in the sauna, and told him how exciting Ifound the poems. We sat together on the top step—which is the hottest part—untilone of the children made it uninhabitable by ladling more cold water on to thehot coals, so that the heat became suffocating. So we went out and jumped intothe lake, swam for a few minutes, then went back and repeated the process. Afterhalf an hour or so of this, we agreed we were sufficiently dehydrated, and Iasked Brad if he felt like coming back for a glass of wine (an excellentFinnish-bottled Beaujolais that I had found in the state liquor store inTampere). So we walked back over the low wooden bridge to my chalet, filled twotumblers to the brim, and clinked glasses. And when Brad began to tell me thestory of how he came to write the ‘concentrates’—and also to paint pictures andcreate metal sculptures—I encouraged him to begin at the beginning. It was astory so remarkable that I interrupted him to tell him he ought to write a bookabout it. He shrugged and said he didn’t feel he was a writer. And as he talkedon, the conviction came upon me that if he wouldn’t write the book, then I woulddo it for him. Before he had finished, I even knew what I intended to call it:Access to Inner Worlds."},{"pageContent":"3—HOW TO CONTACT THE ‘OTHER SELF’Early in 1961, Brad and his wife decided to adopt a newly-born baby, whosemother had been unable to take care of him. Like all adoptive parents, theywanted the opportunity to give love and protection to a child in need. But fateseemed to be against the venture from the beginning. During the early months ofhis life, the child had been left alone for long periods. This is, of course,the most vital formative period of a baby’s life—the period at which‘imprinting’ occurs. Konrad Lorenz made the observation that baby monkeys thatdo not receive the love of a mother during this period become incapable offorming emotional attachments; it seems that the give-and-take of love isimprinted within the first weeks of a child’s life. And the baby had been leftlying on one side for such long periods that one side of the head had becomeslightly flattened and malformed. From the beginning, their adopted child was‘difficult’, screaming incessantly for attention, yet hardly seeming to respondto their attempts to give love.In one sense at least, the child was fortunate; Brad and his wife weredetermined to do their best. With less responsible parents, the end result mighthave been a battered baby. It was not as if their son was an only child—they hadthree others, and a fourth arrived subsequently.Then, when the boy was four and a half, he was found to have an abdominalcancer. The growth was removed, and the operation seemed to be successful. But ayear later, a check-up revealed nodes of cancer scattered all over his internalorgans. It was clear that the child was going to die. They decided to devotethemselves to trying to make the last months of his life as complete and asrewarding as possible. The child seemed to grow up and change quite suddenly, asif in some way trying to make up for the years that were lost. He requiredconstant attention; Brad and his wife took turns sitting up with him at night.The months extended to a year, then eighteen months. His eventual death was ashattering experience for everyone.Brad’s wife took it very badly. She was physically and emotionally exhausted,and delayed shock induced severe depression. Brad watched her descend into asubjective world of guilt and self-questioning; she lost interest in the outsideworld. Plunged into destructive self-analysis, she felt at times that she wasdamned, and that the whole world was damned with her. The depressions werebalanced by a manic counter-phase in which she seemed to experience ecstasies ofindescribable absolute freedom.For hours at a time she lay on the bed, her eyes closed, struggling with guiltand depression. When she emerged from these inner spaces, that seemed to be asdepressing as Piranesi’s dungeons, Brad was always there beside her, ready toprovide her with a link to the world of reality. At first, he was convinced thatthis was a growth-process, from which she would emerge stronger than ever. Butgradually, it became clear that she was not improving. These descents into themind can inaugurate a process of negative feedback, a kind of inner landslide ofpessimism. When it became clear that her experiences were becoming frightful andunmanageable, Brad decided to look for outside help. A point came where, for thesake of the children, he felt it necessary to commit her to hospital. On the daya friend drove them there, he felt that he had reached a limit of physical andpsychological exhaustion—that if something had complicated or prolonged theproblems, he would have experienced physical and nervous collapse. Afterreturning from the hospital, he slept for almost twenty hours.But the ordeal was by no means over. For the next few years, the pattern ofbreakdown, hospitalization and partial recovery continued, and much of theresponsibility for bringing up the children fell on Brad. During the day, heworked as a schoolteacher. In the evening, he had to cope with his wife’sillness, which now involved hallucinatory experiences. He would lie beside herfor hours, waiting for her to emerge into reality. He learned to become relaxed,sensitively alert, inwardly poised for the moment when she would ‘surface’ andhe could be of help. It was a continuation of the experience of the last yearsof their son’s life.It was in this state that he began to experience a curious sense of innerfreedom, of release from the body. What happened then can be told in his ownwords:‘One day I was lying on my back on the bed beside my wife during one of theselong periods of relaxed but concentrated sensitivity, when I noticed a clear butpuzzling impulse in the muscles of my upper right arm, near the shoulder. Whatwas clear about it was that the impulse was a movement impulse, i.e. the musclewas indicating a readiness to move. What was puzzling was that I had no thoughtor intention of moving my arm for any reason at the moment. However, beingdeeply relaxed, and having the underlying feeling of well-being that accompaniedit, I was not alarmed, but I was rather curious, and I thought something like:“Well, if that arm wants to move, it may.’’ It waited for a moment, during whichthe impulse got stronger, and my arm really did rise slowly from the bed andstop in mid-air as the movement impulse ceased. “This is really interesting,’’ Ithought. “What now?’’ After a brief moment I felt another clear impulse to movein that arm. Again I let it happen, and observed it with interest as my armmoved still further. For the next few minutes I allowed such impulses to move myarm (and soon it was both arms) through a series of movements. My attention wasfollowing what was happening as a definitely interested but non-interferingbystander.’On subsequent occasions, the movement impulses developed and became morecomplex. Brad discovered that he could make a kind of inner gesture ofpermission, and the movement-impulses might or might not avail themselves of it.‘These movements formed series and patterns involving my whole body and mybreathing too. These were not repetitive routines in which the same series andpatterns would occur time after time. Basic movements occurred in differentpatterns, and in different series, lasting different lengths of time, and withdiffering degrees of muscle strain and intensity each time.’What was happening to Brad? The answer, I believe, is simple. The effort toremain ‘awake’ had removed certain of his functions from the realm of themechanical to the realm of the deliberate or controllable. Human beings are 99percent ‘robot’. Our bodies are programmed to breathe, to sleep, to digest, toexcrete; our instincts are programmed to reproduce our kind and protect ourchildren. But our minds are also largely mechanical. A child has to learn tospeak his own language; he then does it automatically, without effort. I caneven learn to speak foreign languages without effort. I am typing this pagewithout effort, because after thirty-odd years, typing has become ‘automatic’.We live automatically. The answer to T.S. Eliot’s question: ‘Where is the lifewe have lost in living?’ is: ‘The robot has stolen it.’It is, of course, extremely convenient to do so many things automatically; itsaves me an immense amount of trouble. But it also robs me of a great deal ofpleasure. When I first learned to drive, it was delightful to climb into a carand set it in motion—a feeling of astonishment and self-congratulation. I canstill recapture that feeling if I make an enormous effort of imagination. Itcosts so much effort because I am having to wrest it from the hands of therobot.The simplest way of ceasing to live ‘mechanically’ is to make a continualattempt at ‘vigilance’, self-awareness. From Brad’s early diaries—dating back tohis first days in Finland—it is clear that he had always made this effort towrest a little freedom from the hands of the robot. In 1955, he wrote: ‘Fiveyears have gone by since I consciously began in this direction, and these traitswhich I hoped to get rid of are still with me.’ And in 1958 he wrote:> The learning and the teaching> > The fathering and the husbanding,> > this many-sided busyness cloaks a quiet waiting> > for the miracle to happen.But it was the experience of years of stress and exhaustion that caused his own‘miracle’ to happen.The nights of waiting beside his son taught him the discipline of vigilance, ofnon-mechanical waiting. The ‘robot’ could not be allowed to take over; it had tobe kept at bay. It happened again as he lay beside his wife during her longperiods of schizophrenic ‘absence’. And in pushing back the boundaries of hismechanicalness, he was extending the area of his freedom.But the freedom applied to the right-brain ‘self’ as well as to the left. Theright-brain entity is usually modest and self-effacing; it defers to theassertive left-brain ego. But as Brad’s left-brain ego remained in suspensionfor hours at a time, the right began—with a certain hesitancy—to express itself.He gave it permission to continue. The result was the series of spontaneousmovements.And what was the right-brain self trying to achieve in these movements? Theanswer is to be found in his statement: ‘My body was getting into bettercondition than it had been for a long time.’ To a large extent, we drive ourbodies with the will. Look at a man walking through the city with his briefcase;everything about him—his quick, firm walk, the way he leans forward slightly,the way he swings his umbrella—all testify to his purpose and his need toachieve maximum efficiency. It is completely different from his walk as hestrolls home from a cricket match. The right brain prefers to do things slowlyand easily, but the left is always in a hurry. Brad’s right brain was saying, ineffect: ‘If you give me a chance, I’ll show you how to relax properly and how touse your body properly. I’ll show you how to perform your physical functionswith a minimum of effort, and how to recover quickly from fatigue ...’He records: ‘The whole process became flowing and fluent as time went on.Furthermore, I could choose to slip into these movement experiences from muchless intense levels of relaxation, and in an increasing variety of situations;for example, while sitting at my desk, sitting in an audience listening tosomeone lecture or in a theatre or concert hall; or standing at a bus stopwaiting for a bus. For each situation I would choose limits to the kind ofmovements allowed so as not to draw attention or become conspicuous. Theselimits did not at all seem to prevent the process or lessen the quality of theexperience for me.‘One of the first things I had noticed during the first few weeks of theseexperiences was that I could trust my body to move safely; that is, even thoughI usually had my eyes closed to better concentrate, I never moved so as to falloff the bed, or hit the wall or piece of furniture with some part of my body ifI were elsewhere in a room...’ The part of the mind that enables a sleepwalkerto stroll along the top of a wall without falling off had surfaced in Brad whenhe was otherwise fully conscious. He also noticed: ‘Ordinary movements likewalking, sitting, getting up from a seated position, were not only gettingeasier, but they were also changing. I found myself beginning to choose to siton hard chairs or seats, and to sit on the front part of the seat with my backstraight and lightly balanced. This did not require any forceful consciousmuscular efforts on my part; it was not a disciplined effort—on the contrary, itwas easier to sit that way.’One day, as he stood in the queue in the dining-room, waiting to collect foodfrom the buffet, he observed the now-familiar impulse in his right hand and arm.He allowed the hand to reach out towards the food. It went over the first plate,and took a spoonful of food from the second plate. He relaxed and waited; thearm again reached out and took food from another plate. This continued until ithad served the whole meal. The choice of food surprised him. His hand reachedfor foods that he had not touched for years. But there was no regular pattern.No foods were totally ignored and none were regularly chosen. The same held trueof the amounts of food. ‘Going to meals became very exciting because I neverknew beforehand what kind of meal I would choose for myself. Sometimes, I wouldfind myself taking only a glass of sour milk or a glass of water, and, joiningthe others who were eating, saying by way of explanation that I did not seemhungry at the moment. Once I found myself engaging in a complete fast, exceptfor teas and juices and water, and for five days I went to the dining-room foreach meal, not knowing if I would eat that meal or not.’ But there was nophysical discomfort. As a result of this new way of eating, his weight, whichhad been between eighty-two and eighty-five kilograms, dropped by ten kilograms,and remained there.Brad recalled an experiment in nutrition performed in the early fifties. Varioustypes of food were placed on the floor, and infants were allowed to move amongthem and choose their own. After a short time—three or four weeks—the infantssettled into a routine of eating which, according to the nutrition experts, wasan ideal ‘healthy diet’. Abraham Maslow had once cited a similar experiment;chickens were allowed to choose their own foods; but in this case, theun-nutritive food was flavoured with something that made it smell good, whilethe nutritive food smelt unappetizing. What emerged in this case was theobservation that the dominant chickens—5 percent of the total—began to choosethe nutritive food, in spite of its smell, while the non-dominant ones chose theappetizing food. The result was that the dominant chickens became even moredominant, while the non-dominant ones became less so. The lesson is plainly thatthe dominant creatures have a stronger instinct for the food which is best forthem. But the baby experiment reveals that all human babies, both dominant andnon-dominant, make an instinctive choice of what is good for them. The choicecomes from what George Groddeck called the ‘It’, that something else inside usthat seems to know what is best for us. In adults, this is always beingoverruled by the left-brain ego—and, in most cases, not for any sound reason. Itis not good sense on any level when, because I am feeling tense, I gulp down ameal at top speed. It only gives me indigestion. And I may often know perfectlywell that what I am doing is silly; my reason, which is closely connected to theleft-brain ego, can see that quite clearly. So what is making me eat too fast?Not my reason, and certainly not my instinct, but a conglomeration that I canonly call ‘the false self’. Rather complicated feedback mechanisms are at work:my tension releases adrenalin into my system, and the adrenalin urges me to eatfaster, even though I may feel that this is bad for me. My ‘robot’ then proceedsto develop bad eating habits; and if I become anxious about these, things mayget worse than ever. What is necessary is quite obvious. The controlling ‘I’ hasto assert itself, and set out to break the bad habits. It must cease to feelhelpless and passive. For the final decisions always lie in the hands of thiscontrolling ego.Brad himself came to recognize this through an interesting experience. His wifewas also beginning to experience spontaneous movements, and the two of themwould sometimes allow these movements to integrate into patterns. ‘Sometimes wefound ourselves acting out non-verbal role playing in situations which alsodeveloped without conscious intent.’Late one evening, Brad and his wife began a ‘duet’ of spontaneous movements. Itdeveloped into a situation in which he made sexual advances which she resisted.Brad allowed the impulses to continue, and began making increasingly strongassaults, until a kind of attempted rape developed. She continued to plead withhim to stop; he made no attempt to check the impulse. Suddenly, his impulsecollapsed, and they both felt frightened and bewildered. Brad began to wonderwhether he could trust an impulse that had led to a near-rape. The next day, hetelephoned a friend who had studied Zen Buddhism in Japan. Her reply was that nomatter how much power and authority these impulses seemed to have, he mustrecognize that he was in charge. ‘The part is not meant to dominate the whole.’His mistake had been to assume that this ‘other self’, which seemed to have adeeper insight into questions of health and diet, must be right abouteverything. In essence, her advice was: stop being so passive. This is only apart of you. Consult it by all means, but do not make it your sole guide andmentor.My own interpretation of this episode would be that Brad’s ‘other self’ wasattempting to correct another kind of imbalance. I have never met anyone whostruck me as less capable of rape than Brad. His whole personality is gentle,thoughtful, receptive. His early journals show continuous self-analysis andself-criticism. Yet all men need to be capable, at times, of expressing somedegree of aggression, if only jokingly. Presumably the ‘impulse’ was trying toadd a dash of sexual aggression to the totality of Brad’s personality...In short, the ‘It’, the other self, is the regulator of the body and theinstincts, what Gurdjieff called ‘the moving centre’. It is, in short, the‘wisdom of the body’. And it has no real jurisdiction in the realm of the mind.Its task—when it is allowed to get on with it—is to maintain physical health andbalance. Brad noticed this one day when he came back from his first ski of thewinter; as he lay on the bed, his muscles aching, his leg muscles began makingspontaneous movements in the opposite direction from the strains he could feelin his muscles. In effect, they were saying: ‘Don’t just lie there waiting forthe tiredness to go away; you can do something about it.’ We have all noticedsomething of the sort. When very tired, the best way to unwind is not to liedown and try to relax; it is to get absorbed in something else. Five minutes’total absorption—let us say, in some fascinating news item ontelevision—recharge our vital batteries more than hours of trying to relax.Watching cats, dogs and babies in Viittakivi, Brad noticed how many of theirmovements seemed to have no obvious purpose. In adults, such spontaneousmovements become restricted to yawning, stretching, rubbing the eyes,scratching, and a few others; but anyone can observe that pleasant ripple thatflows along the muscles when we yawn and stretch, and how it is followed byrelaxation.Another important point to note is that most of us have no idea of how really torelax. The only time we do it ‘properly’ is when we have been anxious, and theanxiety disappears. Imagine a man lying out on his front lawn on a sunny day,reading the newspaper. Suddenly his wife looks out of the window and says: ‘Isbaby out there with you?’, and he says: ‘No’, and jumps to his feet. For fiveminutes there is considerable tension as they rush out into the street andsearch the house—until they find baby asleep under the bed. And when he liesdown in the sunlight again, he feels really relaxed; the relief almost makes himfeel dizzy. Events like this make us aware that, even when we think we arerelaxed, half our circuits are still switched on. Why? Because modern life getsus into a habit of ‘vigilance’, and we may become so accustomed to continuousmovement that we never have time to ‘unwind’.But even this does not explain why I cannot relax when I want to—when I am lyingin the sunlight with nothing to do for the rest of the day. In order tounderstand this, we have to recognize that the real culprit is ‘the robot’, thatautomatic servant who becomes so accustomed to rushing that he begins toanticipate our wishes—or what he thinks are our wishes—and keeps us in a stateof subconscious alertness all the time. When the robot has formed a habit, itcan only be broken by determined conscious effort.The widest and most prevalent example is boredom. When I prepare to engage insome interesting task, I generate a certain tension—another name for energy—andthis tension is discharged as I perform the task. My robot, accustomed tononstop activity, maintains a state of subconscious tension for most of thetime. (I use subconscious here to denote the twilight realm between consciousand unconscious.) And his foresight is usually justified—life is always throwingup unexpected challenges. But if, for some reason, I have to sit quietly for afairly long time—in a dentist’s waiting-room, in an airport lounge, on atrain—the tension begins to form a pool inside me. If we observe ourselves in astate of boredom, we note that it is a state of discomfort, like wanting tourinate badly.The consciousness of modern man has an almost permanent substratum of this kindof discomfort—in other words, of boredom. When a crowd at a boxing match or afootball game screams itself hoarse, it is deliberately discharging thistension. Football hooliganism is a simple and understandable extension of thismethod. The hooligan has just seen how satisfactorily he can discharge histensions by cheering for his team, and his unconscious mind cannot understandwhy he should not extend this principle and display conspicuous gallantry incombat with the supporters of the other team, or against these ‘civilian’shopkeepers and publicans who are not on one side or the other... (All soldiersfeel a patronizing contempt for non-combatants.)This is the ‘mechanical’ method of discharging tension (boredom). But there isan alternative method: the method of conscious control. Imagine that you areabout to set out on a long train journey—a journey that usually leaves youexhausted and shattered—and for some reason you are convinced you will have aserious accident. On the train, you sit and stare out of the window, wonderingif today is your last. Every time the train brakes, you tense your muscles,waiting for the crash. Yet you never experience a single moment of boredom; andwhen you get off at your destination, you are surprised to feel as fresh as whenyou got on board. Maintaining continual alertness has prevented the robot fromtaking over. Moreover, when you finally settle down in an armchair to watchtelevision, you sink into a deep and genuine relaxation, free of underlyingtension. You have temporarily broken a bad habit...This is how Brad achieved total relaxation, lying at the side of his wife in acondition in which total alertness was combined with relaxation. His consciousmind undid the bad habits of a lifetime. As a result, he was launched into atotally new area of experience.What had happened is that Brad had reconstituted the parliament of his mind, andgiven the Member for the Subconscious (or the right brain) wider powers ofaction. He immediately found one field of activity in which this wider powercould be utilized. Bee-keeping had always been one of his major enthusiasms. Hisfamily was fond of honey, and Brad enjoyed the ritualistic aspect of the work.He would first take a shower, to lessen body odour—bees are understandablyhighly sensitive to smells, since they detect flowers by their sense of smell.He would don the protective clothing, like an astronaut. Then the opening of thehives would be performed like a slow-motion ballet, so as not to alarm ordisturb the bees. Even before the movements started, Brad derived deepsatisfaction from tending his bees; after a morning of slow-motion activity, hewould lose all sense of time. He had slowed down the left brain until it workedat the same pace as the right. And, according to Sperry’s observations, theright brain has very little sense of time. After the ‘movements’ began, he foundthat he could enter into the ritual of bee-keeping with a new sensitivity.Before he approached the hives, he would stand there, and engage in an innerdialogue. ‘I am consciously aware of various factors that should influence mydecisions about my work with the bees. But I know I am also subconsciously awareof many other factors. In years of experience, I have noticed many things thathave influenced my behaviour towards the bees; I must allow these to influencemy decisions today. I have also forgotten many things; it would be good if thesetoo could influence my behaviour...’ And, with this ritual dialogue completed,he would wait for the movement impulses to take over, and then allow them tocarry out his work with the bees. He never quite decided whether this new methodincreased the output of honey. The only thing that was quite certain was thatthis way of working was deeply satisfying, a way of entering the situation withhis whole being, like a man wading into the sea.Another experience of this period underlines an important aspect of thesemovements. During a flu epidemic, Brad had to spend several days in bed. Lyingthere on a Sunday afternoon, completely relaxed, he allowed the movementimpulses to take over. They led him out of bed and into the kitchen, where hefound himself putting the kettle on to boil, and then—moving veryslowly—choosing certain dishes, arranging them on the tray, placing a decorativecentrepiece in their midst, preparing the tea, carrying the tray to the carpetedfloor of the living room, and there sitting down and going through a stylizedtea-drinking ceremony. He had seen the tea ceremony performed in that same roomby a Japanese student; but this was not at all the same thing. He was struck bythe thought that perhaps the original tea ceremonies had originated in this way.In fact, the Japanese tea ceremonies, like their rock gardens, are designed tocreate a state of inner calm which will allow the emergence of such subconsciousimpulses.The next stage of this development was yet more interesting, and raisesimportant questions. One day when Brad was sitting at the tea table, drinking athird cup of tea and feeling relaxed and sleepy, his little daughter asked himto make a drawing that she could colour. When Brad said he was too sleepy, sheleft the pencil and paper, and went off to play. He felt the familiar impulse inhis arm, and watched his hand move out to pick up the pencil. It drew a line,relaxed, then drew another line, and went on until the drawing was finished. Itwas a curious, flower-like pattern. The next day, after work, he took someoil-pastel crayons, relaxed into a state of receptive readiness, and againwatched his hand take up crayons and create an exotic fantasy flower. Thiscontinued for the next two weeks, flower after flower, all quite different.Brad brought a folder of his drawings along to our chalet, and I found themfascinating. I have a box of colour transparencies of them beside me as I write,and even in this much-reduced form, I find them very striking. Each one is abeautiful, elaborate and complete pattern, virtually a completed painting. Twoof them resemble Paul Klee fish (many people who have seen them have thisimpression of Paul Klee fantasy at first glance). I imagine that Klee was givingexpression to the same deep pattern-making impulses of the subconscious. Theyare all very elaborate, and deeply satisfying to look at. A bad painting ordrawing, like a bad piece of writing, seems too crude and obvious—so much moreobvious than life. A good painting has some satisfying complexity that makes itresemble life. Brad’s colour drawings all have this complexity. Although theyall look like small fragments of various—and totally different—patterns, theyare quite unlike, say, the design of a carpet, which is repetitive. These seemto be designs caught in flight as they rush through the mind, expanding intoother designs with the infinite variety of the unconscious. Some look likeglimpses of space with exploding stars, some like a shower of multicolouredeyeballs, some like strange angular birds, some like Douanier Rousseau flowers,some like creatures seen under a microscope, some like curious abstractpaintings. To my mind, they are the most striking of the products of his‘impulses’, for they could not be faked. They leave no doubt that thesubconscious self knew precisely what it was doing. They are instant, visualevidence that something very strange took place. Their variety seems enormous;they could be reproduced in a book, and would be as visually satisfying as thework of most modern painters; moreover, they give the impression of coming froman inexhaustible supply, as if Brad could have gone on producing one a day forten years without repeating himself.The first dozen or so drawings were produced in less than two weeks, and thenBrad temporarily ‘dried up’. He felt that it was a pity to allow this ability toslip away, and tried nudging it into activity. The impulses began again, butthis time the results seemed to be a crude, mocking caricature of the previousdrawings, and he had a strong feeling that something was wrong. He found himselfsaying to himself: ‘All right, I get the message—I will not force myself todraw.’ And he stopped. Six months later, the impulse returned; he bought a packof colour felt-pens, and began again, this time producing another seventy-two inabout eighteen months. As he did them, he had a sense of watching a stranger atwork. In some cases, he would criticize: ‘My God, how can that colour possiblygo with the others?’ But the stranger always knew best. Finally came twoparticularly fine drawings which he labelled ‘The fireball’ and ‘The icecrystal’. These seemed to have a quality of finality, like a period at the endof a sentence. It was as if some inner territory had been completely mapped. Thedrawing impulse then disappeared, except for two small ‘epilogue’ drawings.This drawing period raises more questions than I can fully discuss in a shortbook. The drawings resemble ‘psychedelic patterns’, but they were not producedunder any kind of drug. This suggests that the patterns seen by patients whohave taken mescalin, LSD or one of the other mind-changing drugs are in some way‘objective’ parts of some inner landscape—perhaps Jung’s ‘archetypes of thecollective unconscious’. In my book Mysteries I discuss the Frenchman RenéDaumal, who attempted to explore his ‘inner world’ by holding a handkerchiefsoaked with ether against his nostrils; when he began to lose consciousness, hishand would fall and he would recover. In this way he hoped to snatch glimpses ofhis unconscious mind. He had an overwhelming sense of meanings flashing by at apace too fast to pin down, ‘an instantaneous and intense world of eternity, aconcentrated flame of reality’, a vision of circles and triangles moving andcombining in an inexpressibly complex manner, and a sound like a ritual chant orformula. Daumal speaks of a vision of curved non-Euclidian space and time.Again, in a remarkable book called A Drug Taker’s Notes, R. H. Ward speaks ofhis experiences under dental gas, and later with LSD25. He speaks of thesensation of passing, after a few whiffs of gas, ‘into a state of consciousnessalready far more complete than the fullest degree of ordinary wakingconsciousness’. Again, he gives pages of description of his experience of theseinner realms. There are dozens of similar experiences on record, leaving nopossible doubt that our ordinary consciousness is of an extremely inferior andlimited variety, like looking at a scene through a crack in a fence, and thatthe ‘inner realm’ is a genuinely objective realm, not a subjective world ofdreams and delusions. In a state of mental stress just before the First WorldWar, Jung learned how to descend, consciously, into this inner realm—a trick hecalled ‘active imagination’—and described his experiences in detail in hisautobiography Memories, Dreams, Reflections. (And again, I have discussed theseat length in Mysteries, particularly in the chapter called ‘Descent into theUnconscious’.)At the moment, we know as little of these inner realms as William the Conquerorknew about the world beyond Europe. It was only in the 1950s that Aldous Huxleyfirst clearly formulated this notion that the inner realm is as vast, as realand as strange as the globe upon which we live. One day, when future Columbusesand Vasco da Gamas have provided accurate maps of the New Worlds of our minds,we shall re-read Jung, R.H. Ward, René Daumal, John Lilly, and be able tospecify just what part of this terra incognita was explored in their pioneerinner voyages. And when that happens, I think we shall also look at Brad’sdrawings, and recognize that each one is as precise and significant as theformulae of relativity or quantum mechanics. When I spoke of them with Brad, hedescribed his own feeling that the ‘someone’ who made them was trying to tellhim things which could only be expressed in this way. I also have an obscuresense of a meaning slightly beyond my grasp as I look at them—but not, as withmusic, because there is no exact verbal equivalent; rather, because they areglimpses of a pattern that I have never seen as a whole.But even if we are inclined to reject all this as mysticism, at least it cannotbe doubted that the drawings reveal the ‘other’ part of the brain as a reservoirof pure creativity. This was equally obvious when I looked at some of Brad’s‘metal sculptures’. He brought them along at the same time as the drawings, andat first I was dazzled by the almost oriental intricacy of the patterns. Theywere all made out of the same kind of scrap metal—sheets of ‘leftovers’ afterholes had been punched out, leaving a lattice or grid made up of connectedtriangles. It seemed unbelievable that so many patterns could be made out ofanything so simple—by comparison, my younger son’s ‘Rubik snake’ is crude andobvious. Brad said that he was equally surprised; he had simply watched hishands bending the metal with a pair of pliers, and had no idea of what wouldemerge. Obviously, what had happened was that the pattern-making department ofhis brain—the right hemisphere—had succeeded in taking over his hands, andexpressing its ideas without any kind of interference from the critical faculty.And this in itself is something of a miracle. As I write these words, themeanings of what I intend to say emerge from my right brain, and my left catchesthem and clothes them in words. After years of practice, it does this quitecompetently. And unless my left brain performed its part of the operation, themeaning would simply remain unexpressed. Even artists and musicians and balletdancers have to use the intermediary of the left hemisphere to select and filtertheir spontaneous impulses. If the left is feeling tired, or intervenes tooactively (out of nervousness or self-consciousness) the communication becomesjammed, and a kind of stutter emerges. (Stuttering itself is the mostcommonplace example of excessive interference of the left brain with right-brainfunctions.) We all know that we do these things best if we do them without toomuch self-consciousness. Michael Polanyi pointed out that a pianist whoconcentrated on his fingers would play badly. He must attend from his fingers,to the music.Here is the basic insight into the whole problem discussed in the openingchapter—the problem of ‘alienation’, the feeling of ‘absurdity’, ‘nausea’,futility and meaninglessness. They all involve attending to something instead ofattending from it. Sartre’s ‘nausea’, in the novel of that title, is due tolooking at the tree and nothing but the tree—failing to see beyond it to thewood. A stutter is like a brake that keeps catching on the wheel, making itshudder. In ‘nausea’, the brake has locked completely.What Brad achieved was the equivalent of a wheel without a brake. The stutterercannot help interfering with his natural self-expression, even though he wouldgreatly prefer not to interfere; the interference has become automatic, robotic.Brad had succeeded in persuading his left brain to adopt a policy of totalnon-interference. Betty Edwards’s book Drawing on the Right Side of the Braindescribes various tricks for persuading the left brain to stop interfering. Shepoints out that many sketches of familiar objects are bad because we know toomuch about the object, and try to put this knowledge into the drawing. Ifsomeone looks at the object through a simple ‘view-finder’, and concentrates onits mere shape, ignoring all other data, the result is a far more accuratedrawing. Brad’s hours of ‘suspended consciousness’, lying beside his wife, werea far more effective method of preventing left-brain interference.The next stage was the writing of the poetry—or rather, the ‘concentrates’. Butbefore we discuss these, another experience of the same period should bementioned.‘One morning, in my study, movement-impulse writing began, but the handwritingthat took form on the page was completely foreign to me—it was not like myhandwriting at all. I do not remember the sentence word for word, but it was asentence in which a person, who named herself, briefly introduced herself. Ilooked at the sentence in amazement. Always, up to now, I had felt quite clearlythat my movement-impulse writing was expressing various levels of myself. Strongrejecting feelings filled me completely. I put the pencil down, pushed the paperaway, and found myself saying with a tone of uncompromising determination:“I...will...not...be...a...mouthpiece...for...anyone...but...myself!”’This is important, because it makes it clear that Brad recognized‘movement-impulses’ as a part of himself. (This, justifies his own deliberatereshaping of some of the ‘concentrates’.) Many modern investigators in the fieldof psychical research are inclined to believe that all ‘automatic writing’ issimply an expression of the unconscious mind of the writer. Brad’s experienceclearly contradicts this view. On this one occasion, he recognized the ‘entity’as another person who wanted to join in the dialogue. He concludes, ‘There wasnever a repetition of that kind of experience.’This explains, then, why the ‘concentrates’ were less spontaneous than thedrawings or metal sculptures. Among Brad’s notes, I see many early poems datingfrom his earliest years in Finland, and these have that same quality ofphotographic observation that is found in the concentrates:> The black glass-smooth lake with its cold shine> > breathes a whispy mist> That makes the far shore tree groups into dark,> > solitary islands.And he admits that the writing period began as a result of conscious meditationupon the theme, ‘What are words?’ But the process followed the familiar pattern.The impulse in his arm would lead him to pick up a pencil and allow his hand towrite, one word at a time, without thinking about it. Then he would read thewords, and try to understand the meaning. He would then attempt to express thismeaning more clearly, making sentences around key words. If the writing reachedan impasse, he would relax and allow the ‘automatic writing’ to take over again.This was clearly much more of a collaboration between the ‘two selves’. Butthen, I find it difficult to envisage writing which is not such a collaboration.Sperry’s experiments showed that although the right brain understands language,its linguistic capacities are poor compared with those of the left, just as mostof us write very badly with the left hand (connected to the right brain)compared to the right. Here, it seems to me, the images are moving closer to theworld of our conscious understanding. Reading Brad’s concentrates, I am oftenreminded of the musical landscapes in the symphonies of Bruckner, or of thepeaceful visionary landscapes in the paintings of my friend William Arkle. Whenman wishes to express the impersonal, he turns to nature. It is the same withthe German romantic writer of novelle, Adalbert Stifter. His stories are usuallysimple, like folk tales; they could be told in a few paragraphs. But he devotespage after page to descriptions of natural scenery, or explanations about localcustoms. A critical student might accuse him of padding. But the perceptivereader soon recognizes that, far from being ‘padding’, these descriptions ofhills, mountains, forests, lakes, are in a sense more important than the storyitself. J.P. Stern says of him: ‘We feel he would rather not tell the story atall...’ Stifter is escaping from his personal self through these descriptions ofscenery. And this is surely the heart of the matter. For what he is escaping tois not simply the impersonal world of nature, but his own inner mountainlandscape.This seems to me to be the essence of the longest and most important of Brad’sconcentrates—the one that led to the writing of this book:> Following the afterimage of a wise old man within me> > I walked a road within me,> > up over forested ridges> > down through meadowed valleys,> > to a dead end> > that became a lane, and then a path> > leading towards a muffled roar> > growing louder and louder within me> > to where the path opened out> > of the tangly bushes> > into a spacious green glen,> > and beyond the glen ...> > the roar itself.> > Breaking through the shorelines of a calm upper lake> > overflow waters were rushing down> > boulder strewn, rock studded> > irregular channels> > forming,> > swirling, slashing,> > curling, crashing> > rapids within me.> > Nearby,> > in the dense underbrush surrounding the glen> > lay mossgrown millstones> > worn smooth by wear and weather, memorials of a mill> > once working within me,> > its mechanical being turning the power> > from swirling rushing rapids> > to revolving stones> > grinding the seeds of harvests.> > Within the glen,> > near the rapids bank, was a solitary tree> > of gigantic girth and stature...> > widely spreading, deeply probing roots> > drawing up the overflow into their growth,> > stabilizing the earth along the bank;> > leaves of widely spreading> > highly reaching branches,> > drawing down the sun into their growth,> > releasing refreshment into the air...> > an organic power transformer> > outliving the mill> > within me.> > Downstream, to my right,> > the rushing rapids eased> > into a smooth even flow> > that slowly stilled> > into the calm serene being> > of new found depths.> > I left the rapids and the glen within me,> > still following the afterimage of the wise old man,> > back along the path that became a lane> > that led to the road end, now beginning,> > down through the meadowed valleys,> > up over forested ridges, all familiar now,> > to a point where a path appeared> > in the dense forest along the road.> > I walked this path right off the road> > through the thick tree screen,> > and suddenly, up before my eyes> > stood revealed through thinning trees> > the steep mossy slope of a forested mountain.> > The path led up irregularly...> > around stumps and stones,> > through dead leaves, branches,> > and low bushes with wintered berries,> > hanging dull and red here and there...> > until high up, upon the slope,> > I reached an open clearing around a granite boulder> > which I climbed> > to look back over whence I had come...> > the forests, the ridges,> > the meadows and valleys> > just travelled through.> > There, beyond them,> > lay the calm deep waters> > that were stilling the rushing rapids> > of the flow within me.> > Contrasting patches> > of dark purple cloud shadows> > and glistening radiant sunlight> > moved over land and the peaceful waters,> > and islands rose reflected> > from its still serene surface.> > And along the distant skyline of the far shores> > rose hazy silhouettes of other forested regions yet unreached.This concentrate excited me because it was such a striking example of Jung’s‘active imagination’, or of the kabbalistic technique of inner travel. But therewas another reason, connected with my own experiences of tension and ‘panic’. Ihad—as described earlier—identified the root of the trouble as the ‘emotionalbody’, a kind of spoilt child that hides inside all of us, and whose separateidentity only becomes obvious in times of misery or fear, when he becomesuncontrollable. Now in writing the book on the poltergeist, I had returned tothe books of Max Freedom Long on the Hunas of Hawaii, for Huna ‘magicians’(called kahunas) seem to be able to cause appalling damage, even death, bysomehow making magical use of ‘poltergeists’. But what interested me so muchabout the Hunas was their belief that man has no less than three souls or‘selves’, which they call the unihipili, the uhane and the aumakua, meaning ‘lowself’, ‘middle self’ and ‘high self’. When Max Freedom Long first went to Hawaiias a young man, he become so intrigued by the strange beliefs of the Hunas thathe tried hard to penetrate their secrets. He began with the etymology of thesethree Hawaiian words, and concluded that unihipili, low self, means a spiritwhich can grieve but may not be able to talk. Uhane, middle self, means a spiritwhich can talk. And Long quickly became convinced that these two ‘souls’correspond quite exactly to our western notions of the conscious and unconsciousminds. (He rather loosely uses the term ‘subconscious’, which I use to mean thetwilight realm between the two, so I shall refer to the unihipili as theunconscious.)Long goes on: ‘To summarize, the kahuna idea of the conscious and subconsciousseems to be, judging from the root meaning of the names given them, a pair ofspirits closely joined in a body which is controlled by the subconscious andused to cover and hide them both. The conscious spirit is more human andpossesses the ability to talk. The grieving subconscious weeps tears, dribbleswater, and otherwise handles the vital force of the body. It does its work withsecret and silent care, but it is stubborn and is disposed to refuse to obey.’My panic attacks had made me very familiar with that refusal to obey, which ledme to compare the unihipili—which I called the emotional body—to T. E.Lawrence’s camel refusing to go back into the desert. I was also deeply struckby Long’s remark that the unihipili ‘intermingles with or tinctures theconscious spirit to give the impression of being one with it’. That is mostcertainly true. The emotional body is so dangerous because I think it is ‘me’.When the emotional body goes into revolt, I feel completely shattered andundermined because it seems to me that I am betraying myself. Lawrence remarksin the Seven Pillars that during the desert war, he saw men drive themselves tothe limits of endurance, yet there was never a sign of a break unless it camefrom within. When the mind is unified and confident in purpose, nothing can gowrong. When the emotional body becomes hysterical, then and only then are we indanger of inner defeat. This is the basic explanation of all mental illness andof all suicide.Now, the chief characteristic of the uhane (middle self) is that it can talk,which reminds us that this function is governed by the left brain. And we havealready seen that this left-brain self is the ‘everyday self’, the consciousnessthat confronts the world, the being who ‘copes’ with human existence. Thisnotion is confirmed by Enid Hoffman’s book, Huna: A Beginner’s Guide, in achapter called ‘The selves in the brain’. She remarks: ‘The middle self, whoseconsciousness is centred in the left hemisphere of the cortex...of the brain,continually reviews the information coming from the low self, whoseconsciousness is centred in the solar plexus.’ And this identification of the‘dwelling place’ of the unihipili also seems to make sense. When we are in anupset and undermined condition, we keep on feeling a ‘sinking sensation’ in thepit of the stomach.So the spoilt schoolboy lives in the solar plexus, and the ‘middle self’ livesin the left brain. Then what of the right brain? According to Enid Hoffman’sinterpretation of the kahunas, this is the home of the ‘high self’, the aumakua.According to the kahunas, the high self knows the future and can control it. Ifthe unihipili is our unconscious ‘basement’, then the aumakua is thesuperconscious ‘attic’. The main difference between the unconscious and thesuperconscious is that we can, if we relax deeply, allow the activities of theunconscious to enter consciousness. But the activities of the superconscious arenormally inaccessible to us. We can, according to the kahunas, communicate withthe ‘high self’ (and so control our own futures), but it has to be done via the‘low self’. The telephone line from the middle self runs via the low self; thereis no direct line to the superconscious.One obvious consequence is that if the ‘low self’ is in a state of misery andrevolt—as mine was during the panic attacks—then no messages can get through tothe superconscious; there is too much crackling on the line. If we wish to makeuse of the superconscious, the first step is to soothe the unconscious intoserenity.If the unconscious is a spoilt schoolboy, then what symbol would be appropriatefor the superconscious? I had already decided, before I read Brad’s poem, thatit was the wise old man of Jung’s inner voyages. So Brad’s poem fell upon groundthat was perfectly prepared for it.I asked Brad how he had come to write the poem, and his explanation confirmed myfeeling that it was a communication of the aumakua. In June 1976, he began toexperience a feeling of restlessness and a need to be alone. By now, herecognized the symptoms well enough to know that he had to find the time and thepatience to allow something to surface. He telephoned friends who lived in aremote part of central Finland, Bob and Beverley Schrader, and asked if he couldgo and spend a few days with them. On the evening of his arrival, Beverleymentioned that she had recently discovered an interesting piece of scenery onone of her walks. The next morning, Brad set off on the walk she hadrecommended. ‘During the whole walk I sensed everything with slow, intensiveconcentration—not thinking about it, but just taking it all in very deeply.Everything about that walk felt significant and important in some inexplicableway.’ The following day, he accompanied Bob Schrader on a walk in the oppositedirection, and again experienced the same sense of significance, of somethingrising slowly to the surface. By the next morning, he knew that his purpose hadbeen achieved; the walks had accomplished the release of the impulse that hadmade him restless. He was able to write the ‘concentrate’. ‘With the writingcompleted, I felt that it stood in the same relationship to me and my innerworld as my last two paintings had: i.e. that it was a summarized account of theway I had come in my recent personal development, a concentrated synthesis of myinner state of being, a symbolic map of the fundamental features of my innerterritory, and an integrated presentation of my past, present and futuredirection.’The meaning of the symbolism need not at present concern us: the overflowinglake, the rapids, the now-defunct mill, the great tree whose roots hold the banktogether, the forested slopes of the mountain, the clearing with the graniteboulder, the calm waters of the pool. An ‘explained’ symbol is a symbol drainedof half its meaning. But the poem leaves us facing a far more importantquestion: in fact, the question that lies at the centre of this book: what wasBrad’s ‘wise old man’, his aumakua, trying to tell him? The implications are socomplex that they require a chapter to themselves."},{"pageContent":"4—THE ROAD TO VISIONARY CONSCIOUSNESSThe question needs to be considered in stages: the ‘movements’, the ‘teaceremony’, the ‘bee-hive ceremony’, the metal sculptures, the paintings, theconcentrates.We have already seen that the purpose of the original movements seemed to be toimprove Brad’s physical condition, to reduce his weight to its natural level, toteach him to make proper use of his energies and powers of recuperation. Oncethis had been achieved, it seems to have moved on to a more constructive orcreative stage. The emphasis shifted from the body to the mind. The mind ofmodern man flows forward like a narrow, fast stream; it needs to be taught tobroaden into a slow-flowing river. Brad’s ‘tea ceremony’ seems to have been anattempt to show him that even a simple, functional activity like making teacould be given a third dimension of meaning, turning it literally into aritual—after all, the purpose of all religious ritual is to re-awaken the memoryof something that we ought never to forget. The same is true of the ‘bee-hiveceremony’. Brad had always performed his work with the bees in a slow anddeliberate manner, because bees respond better to slow movement. The ‘wise oldman’ said, in effect: ‘Why waste this activity? Why not make it an opportunityfor communion with the rest of your being?’ And so tending the bees becameanother religious ritual.The paintings and metal sculptures represent a new level of creativity. Whatsurprised me most about the metal sculptures was their astonishing variety. Iwould not have believed it possible to make so many elaborate and beautifulshapes from those strips of triangular metal. To do so required what Edward deBono calls ‘lateral thinking’. Again, we fail to see these possibilities becauseour minds rush forward in a straight line. In causing Brad’s hands to make theseelaborate shapes, the aumakua was attempting to show him all the hiddenpossibilities that were being overlooked by that over-purposeful left brain. Itwas saying in plain language: ‘You are overlooking half the meaning of the worldthat surrounds you. Slow down. Learn to “stand and stare’’.’The paintings take us a stage further, with their distinctly ‘psychedelic’ air,and we know that psychedelic drugs such as mescalin have the effect ofdisconnecting our obsessive left-brain consciousness, which treats the world asif it were a mere diagram, and making us conscious of its immense, solid,self-sustaining reality. The coloured stripes on Aldous Huxley’s deck chairseemed to become stripes of fire. When mescalin-takers close their eyes, theysee coloured shapes very much like those painted by Brad. I have alreadymentioned the similarity to some of the paintings of Paul Klee. Are thesepaintings a reflection of some strange geometry of our inner world, such as thatglimpsed by Rene Daumal? The most obvious thing about Brad’s paintings is thatevery one of them is clearly a fragment of something larger; not one has an airof self-completeness.I am here reminded of a very remarkable book, Essay on the Origin of Thought byJurij Moskvitin, which deserves to be far better known. Published by OhioUniversity Press in 1974—my copy was sent to me by some unknown well-wisher—itseems to have been more-or-less stillborn.Moskvitin describes how one day, lying in the sunlight with his eyeshalf-closed, he was observing the colour spectrum that sometimes becomes visiblewhen the eyelashes partly cover the eyes. Then, he says: ‘Suddenly I becameaware as if of a film in the background, a screen or a mosaic with the moststrange and beautiful patterns which gave me the feeling of watching somethingparticularly significant’. These patterns were constantly moving and changing,and seemed to be made of several layers or screens moving behind each other.‘Sometimes the patterns became like an embroidery of small interconnectedswastikas, sometimes combinations of triangles and meandering ornaments...’ Andas he gradually developed the ability to focus upon these patterns, herecognized their similarity to patterns in religious art, or ‘art andornamentation created by civilizations dominated by mystical initiation andexperience’. The forms began to suggest figures of the physical world, butalways highly stylized, like Mexican masks. The patterns changed into otherpatterns when some rows of the ‘mosaic’ seemed to become prominent, to standout. Studying these, he became convinced that they were made up of ‘dancingsparks’ of the kind sometimes seen in migraine. He compared the effect to apainting by the 'pointilliste' painter Signac, and began to believe that ournormal visual field is actually made up of these sparks, although we do notnormally focus on them.Moskvitin’s next observation was that the sparks had tiny tails, like comets ortadpoles, and that the sparks and their tails seemed to be part of somethinglarger—smoke-like forms floating in the air. He compares the effect to a Dutchpainting in which a beautiful wine glass, on closer observation, proves to besimply a few dashes of yellow paint. In other words, we impose our own meaningson these smoke-like forms, rather as you can rub your eyes until you see flashesof colour behind your eyelids, and then cause these splashes to change intovarious shapes as your daydreams or thoughts somehow mingle with them. He says:‘The forms came floating out of anything I looked at, lying like cobwebs aroundall objects, and from these stretching into my eyes, as if the objects emanatedfrom me’ (my italics).Moskvitin’s way of expressing his ideas is often obscure, and needs translatinginto simpler terminology. Here, for example, is one of his key sentences:‘If we remember that the essential difference between what we call the realworld and the world of imagination and hallucination is not the elements ofwhich we build them up but the sequence in which these elements appear—at randomor directed by the sequence of external impulses—then it follows that thesequences directed from without represent a limitation of the otherwiseunlimited combinations of the selective forms released at random from within.’The last part of the sentence offers a flash of his meaning. We can see thatBrad’s paintings seem to suggest unlimited ‘inner forms’, a patterned world ofinfinite variety; Moskvitin is saying that the external world that our eyesreveal to us is just a limited version of that larger inner world. So he issaying here that these ghostly or smoke-like forms in some way constitute theexternal world (at least, as seen by our eyes). They can be ‘constituted’ in twoways: either from within—as when I rub my eyes and make the colours alter theirshapes—or from without. What he seems to mean is that the world outside usarouses in us certain stock responses, certain expectations, and these shape the‘forms’ into the familiar objects of the world.A simple way of grasping his meaning is to think of the Rorschach test in whichthe patient is asked to look at a shapeless ink-blot and tell the psychiatristwhat it reminds him of. Or of the way we can stare into a fire or at the cloudsand see various faces and shapes. It is obvious there that we are selectingcertain elements in the cloud or the inkblot, and then projecting our ownexpectations or visions into it.Now Moskvitin is suggesting that, without being aware of it, we constantly‘project’ a ghostly substance made of pinpoints of light on to the externalworld, just like the cloud or inkblot, and then project our expectations intoit. I might reply: ‘Nonsense. I know I am now seeing a tree.’ But then, youmight say, ‘I know I am now seeing a glass’ when I look at the Dutch painting;but a closer look shows me that it is merely a few streaks of paint, which onclose examination do not even look like a glass.All this sounds highly speculative and mystical—particularly later in the book,when Moskvitin speaks about the mystic Plotinus, who seems to feel that wesomehow ‘project’ the real world from deep inside the soul, as if the soul werea cinema projector and the world was merely a blank screen. In fact, Moskvitin’sideas are simply an interesting variation on the basic insights of thephilosopher Edmund Husserl. Husserl’s basic recognition is that perception isintentional. We tend to think, when we see something, that it simply walks inthrough our eyes and is grasped by the brain. But even this way of expressingthe idea gives the show away. For if I happen to be daydreaming, or thinking ofsomething else, then I do not grasp what I happen to be looking at, and as aresult, I do not see it. If I look at my watch without paying attention, I donot see the time—or rather, I do not grasp it, and I have to look a second timewith my attention awake. In order to perceive something I must reach out andgrasp it, just as I pick up a book in my hand.This insight sounds commonplace enough—hardly the basis for a revolutionary newphilosophy of perception. But as soon as we know that we have to grasp activelyfor what we see, we also know that we can look at something with full attentionand still not see its essential meaning because we are not attempting to graspit. As far as I can make out, the television means absolutely nothing to my dog;he is not even interested in Lassie Come Home. I suspect that he simply sees itas moving shapes on a screen, just like the movements of clouds—quitemeaningless, because he does not grasp the sense in it.In the same way, two people can look at an urban landscape of deserted factoriesagainst a background of muddy junk-yards, and experience totally differentreactions. One of them shudders and thinks: ‘How dreary.’ The other, who happensto be an industrial archaeologist, thinks: ‘How fascinating.’But this is not simply a difference of opinion. One is putting far more into itthan the other. If we could get behind the eyes of the two men, we would realizethat one of them sees a dull, poorly-defined landscape, like a smudgyphotograph, while the other sees something more like a great painting. Theindustrial archaeologist’s picture is sharp, clear, full of satisfying coloursand shapes. In short, he is seeing the landscape with a kind of ‘mescalinvision’. And he is doing this by grasping more of it.What Moskvitin is saying is that when we ‘see’ something, we actually paint it.Seeing is an instantaneous act of painting, and the paintbrush is this magicalrush of ‘sparks’ from our eyes. He is not, of course, saying that the world ‘outthere’ does not really exist. He seems to be saying that it is infinitely morebeautiful and complex than we can ever grasp. He remarks:‘Our situation is somewhat that of a horse or dog trained to perform tasks farbeyond its natural capacities.’ And we can easily see that if my dog walks intoa library, it simply does not see the same library that I see, for the bookshave no significance whatever for a dog. But I am prepared to believe that whenwe go for walks, I do not see the world that he sees, for his sense of smell andhis interest in rabbits, foxes, birds and other creatures makes his view ofnature far richer and more complex than mine. But when he walks into my library,his eyes ‘paint’ it in a few strokes.To put this another way: our experience of the world is like listening to apiece of music. When I was a child, all classical music sounded much the same tome—an endless blur of noise. As I grew up, I gradually learned to recognizefeatures in this blur, until now I can tell whether I am listening to a good orbad performance of a Brahms symphony. Anyone can see that it would be nonsenseto say that the child hears the same Brahms symphony as an adult. And I can onlytell a good from a bad performance because I know the symphony well enough tocreate my own symphony as I listen, and compare my mental version with the onebeing played. We ‘create’ the world we see in the same sense.Husserl used to refer to this ‘creative self’ as the transcendental ego. This isthe ‘painter’. But when he paints a Brahms symphony, the painter is limited bythe symphony as Brahms actually wrote it. When he paints a tree or a landscape,he is limited by his knowledge of real trees and landscapes. But when he usesthat strange, magic ‘smoke’ inside his head, he is far less limited. He cancreate his own symphonies and patterns.Yet even if I happen to be a great composer or painter, my work remains somehowlimited. Every artist knows what it means to ‘lack inspiration’; it means thatthe external world, the real world, seems to hold him in chains. He tries tocreate, but he can only observe. This is largely the fault of the left brain.Yet if he closes his eyes and begins to drift into a light sleep, his creativityis released in the forms of images and feelings; he may wake up after a fewminutes completely refreshed and ready for work.So the sheer profusion of patterns in Brad’s paintings could be regarded as theright brain demonstrating its freedom from the limitations of the left. It issaying to the left-brain ego: ‘I am here. Do not leave me out of account. Do notimagine that, when you confront the world, you are alone. I am always waiting inthe background...’The question of why the paintings look like the familiar psychedelic patterns isat present unanswerable; Moskvitin’s explanation seems as good as any: becausethe ‘creative self’, the transcendental ego, is a pattern-maker by profession,and he works in primary colours. We may assume that, if he had felt so inclined,he could have gone on and produced a thousand paintings, all completelydifferent from one another.This left brain, whose development has enabled man to ascend the evolutionaryladder quicker than any known species, has ended by impeding our furtherdevelopment. If Husserl and Moskvitin are right—or rather, because they areright—I am actually the creator of this world I see in front of me. That is notto say, of course, that I am the creator of the real world—that is somethingdifferent again. But of this representation which I take to be ‘reality’, andwhich is actually a ‘painting’, I am undoubtedly the creator. Yet, trapped in myleft-brain sense of identity, I fail to realize this. From the moment I am oldenough to begin to take an interest in the reality around me, I believe that itis ‘real’, quite independent of me. When I feel ecstatically happy at Christmas,and when it seems self-evident to me that this world is infinitely richer andmore marvellous than I had suspected, I believe that I am happy merely becauseit happens to be Christmas. If, a few days later, I remember the ‘vision’ ofChristmas day, and wonder why the world has returned to its usual dullness, Ifeel that this is because my senses are too feeble, my powers of memory tooweak, to maintain the vision. So I become convinced of a double lie: that I amrather weak and mediocre, and that my moments of happiness and vision are dueentirely to circumstance.Fortunately, healthy people experience almost daily flashes of ‘vision’—the peakexperience—which make us aware that there is something badly wrong with ourbasic assumptions; they bring the flash of ‘absurd good news’. The sexual orgasmfloods the senses with energy, and again, we experience the surge of confidence,the certainty of strength. In these moments we see, in a flash, how untrue it isthat ‘the world is what it is’. We see that our optimism, our determination, ourwill-power, can transform it.This transformation can be accomplished in three ways. The first is the leastsatisfactory: we manipulate the senses. Drugs and alcohol will ‘transform’ theworld. And so will giving yourself some ‘reward’—buying yourself somethingexpensive, taking a holiday. But these methods leave us trapped in the oldfallacy: that we are weak and mediocre and that moments of happiness and visionare due to outside circumstance.The second method is the one adopted by most human beings who are determined toevolve: the method of knowledge, of learning new things. Imagine that a dog hasthe potential intelligence of a human being, and that I want to make him awarethat a library is a far more interesting place than he realizes. I would have todeepen his knowledge, make him grasp the function of language, then of writing,and so on. And the dog’s mental painting of the library would acquire depth, akind of third dimension of reality. In the same way, I deepen my perception ofreality by adding to my knowledge. I may, for example, deepen my perception of agame of Rugby football or chess by learning its rules, so I can appreciate whatis happening. I may deepen my perception of music by learning about itsstructure and its history. Science itself is a continual deepening of perceptionof the world. A really important and exciting idea may simply deepen one’sperception of everything, as every religious convert knows.The third method is the most difficult in practice, although the most simple inconception. This is actually to learn to grasp the creative function of the‘creative self’. To judge by his philosophy—a kind of mysticalPlatonism—Plotinus had succeeded; he recognized that the soul is the creator ofthe world. William Blake also seems to have succeeded. He says in his catalogueto Vision of the Last Judgement: ‘The nature of visionary fancy, or imagination,is very little known, and the eternal nature and permanence of its ever existentimages is considered as less permanent than the things of vegetative andgenerative nature...,’ and again: ‘This world of imagination is the world ofeternity; it is the divine bosom into which we shall all go after the death ofthe vegetated body. This world of imagination is infinite and eternal...’ He hasrecognized that this inner being, which creates works of art and literature, isalso the Great Painter of the universe as we know it. And although it does not‘know’ the real universe, this is really a relative matter. That ‘real’ world issimply far more rich and complex than we can grasp. And if we know this, andcontinue to expand our ability to grasp its complexity, then we have nothing tofeel ashamed about. The damned are those who think that their narrow, stupidlittle world is the real universe, and who feel there is nothing more to belearned about it.According, then, to Moskvitin—and Husserl—man finds himself in a most peculiarsituation. He believes that he is in a ‘real’ world which encloses him andlimits his freedom, so that for most of his life, his role is merely that of anobserver. He feels essentially passive. This, says Mokvitin, is untrue. Thisworld that we take for real is projected from some creative centre inside us,and our so called ‘observation’ is, in fact, a continuous act of creativetransformation. He compares the process of perception to the scanning mechanismof a television set, and says that it is as if objects were ‘licked’ with atongue. He goes on:‘Now let us imagine that we ourselves were able to look into this process...Letus suppose that we were suddenly permitted to see the world external to us “aswe see it”. Imagine that step by step we are withdrawing our attention... Thefirst thing we should notice is that the world is not homogeneous andcontinuous; on the contrary, the projection of the retina will make the wholepicture more like a mosaic, something like a painting by Seurat or Van Gogh. Atthe next point, when we focus attention on the firing of the impulse reactions,we should instead see the mosaic dissolving or continually fluctuating as if thewhole thing were composed of myriads of small dancing sparks or mad molecules. Anext step would be to see the spikes themselves—the transmission of the impulsesdown the channels. We should then see the sparks with traces or long tails afterthem...’Out of this insight would arise the realization that the external world is, in asense, created by the power of this inner magician. Man does not understand hisown power, so he remains little better than a worm, unaware of the astonishingsecrets of the transcendental ego. Camus’s L’Etranger paints an accurate pictureof how most of us see ourselves: as little more than mirrors, passivelyreflecting reality. We may, like Meursault, be quite happy about that reality.But if we become nervous or depressed, this cheerful acceptance quickly turnsinto a sense of ‘absurdity’, of being trapped in the repetitive meaninglessnessof the world. Yet this, in itself, is an absurdity. It is as if a theatricaldesigner who had been painting the scenery for the prison in Beethoven’s Fideliohad a lapse of memory, and became convinced that he was locked up in prison.Roquentin, the hero of Sartre’s Nausea, feels that reality is so real that itcompletely negates the human mind. He believes that we can only treat reality socavalierly because we never stop to question the absurd ideas we impose onit—rather like some busybody in a comedy who mistakes a marquis for a servant,and gives him orders, which the marquis, out of amusement and sheer good nature,obeys. Sartre’s attitude is only possible because it is true that we haveseparated ourselves from our intuitive faculties. Living in the left brain meansthat we are in a permanent state of ‘forgetfulness’. So it is easy for thisforgetfulness to go one stage further, and become nervous and self-effacing. Itis as if the busybody realized suddenly that the marquis is not a footman, andallows the shock to scatter his wits and completely undermine his belief thatanything is what it appears to be.According to Moskvitin, all visionaries have glimpsed the basic mechanism of the‘sparks’, and so come to realize intuitively that the inner self is a magician.He cites E.T.A. Hoffmann’s story ‘The Golden Pot’, in which the hero has avision of golden snakes twining themselves in the branches of an elderberry bushand moving so fast that it is as if the bush ‘was spreading a thousand sparklingemeralds among its leaves’. He also quotes Isak Dinesen’s unfinished story ‘TheCaryatids’, a grim little drama about incest. The sister, who is unknowinglymarried to her half-brother, goes to consult a gypsy, and is shown a vision inthe mill pond. It consists of ‘a pattern of glowing red sparks’, which becomes ared evening sky. ‘The sparks were not a pattern on a dark ground, they werethemselves the background.’ Dinesen uses the interesting phrase: ‘all at once,the noise around her changed; it had sense; it spoke’. This is, of course, theessence of the visionary experience: that sudden sense of deep significance. Andthe girl feels ‘a deep ecstasy about this new world opened to her’.Why deep ecstasy? There is nothing in her vision actually to cause ecstasy. Theecstasy of visionary states springs from a glimpse of the mechanism of ‘vision’,the recognition that its source is the ‘inner magician’. We can observe the samething in the famous passage in Proust, in which the narrator tastes the cakedipped in tea, and is suddenly carried back to his childhood. ‘I had ceased tofeel mediocre, accidental, mortal.’ But why should this sudden clear memory ofchildhood produce a feeling of ecstasy? We are all capable of answering thatquestion, for we have all experienced similar ‘glimpses’ of the past: a smell ofBlackpool rock brings back days at the seaside, a smell of hot loaves from abakery suddenly conjures up the bakery we passed on the way home from school atthe age of seven...The smell triggers a sense of freedom. Freedom from what?From our sense of being trapped in the present, like a fly stuck on fly paper,from the belief that we are the slaves of matter. The prophecies of Blake arefull of attempts to express this sense of entrapment. Los, the creativeprinciple—the ‘divine imagination’—is bound in deadly sleep:> And now his eternal life> > Like a dream was obliterated.And in Visions of the Daughters of Albion:> They told me that the day and night were all that I could see;> > They told me that I had five senses to inclose me up,> > And they inclosed my infinite brain into narrow circle,> > And sunk my heart into the abyss, a red, round globe, hot burning,> > Till all from life I was obliterated and erased.> > Instead of morn arises a bright shadow, like an eye> > In the eastern cloud; instead of night a sickly charnel house...In Europe , the female principle declares:> Go! tell the human race that woman’s love is sin;> > That an eternal life awaits the worm of sixty winters> > In an allegorical abode where existence hath never come...In poem after poem, Blake finds symbols to express the way that the spiritsomehow becomes blinded and falls into a state of amnesia. The culprit seems tobe Reason, symbolized as the god Urizen: that is to say, the left brain. Andagain and again, man falls into this state of amnesia from what appears to be apleasant and promising condition. In Europe, Los is just celebrating a victoryover the forces of repression and stupidity, and his wife, Enitharmon, feelsthat it is now time for peace and comfort and relaxation. And this desire forcomfortable domesticity allows mankind to slip into a state of amnesia anddelusion, so that man comes to believe he is a mere ‘worm of sixty winters’.(Blake seems to be attacking the Christian church, which he identifies withpriestcraft and repression.) Finally, the spirit of revolution awakens inFrance, and Los ‘called all his sons to the strife of blood’. Blake feels, likeYeats, that> When a man is fighting mad> > Something drops from eyes long blind> > He completes his partial mind...These glimpses of joy and power are the key to man’s inner possibilities. But itwould be a mistake to think of them as semi-mystical experiences. They are asfamiliar as eating and drinking. We all experience them thousands of times inthe course of a lifetime. Setting out on a holiday, or simply setting out forthe office on a sunny morning, something inside us wakes up, and there is acurious tingle of sheer joy, of ‘absurd good news’. Some power seems to stirinside us, and awakens a hunger which is in some ways like physical hunger. Inour usual state of consciousness, new experience is, on the whole, rejected asan interruption. The telephone rings as we are settling down with the eveningnewspaper, and we curse irritably. A child, full of the appetite for newexperience, rushes eagerly to answer the door or the telephone; he is full of an‘expectancy’ that the adult has rejected.According to Moskvitin, there is another way to achieve the glimpses of joy andpower: to make deliberate use of dreams and hallucinations. This is because hebelieves that the ‘inner magician’ who shapes our perceptions can be seendirectly at work in dreams. This certainly seems to be confirmed, for example,by those who have taken opium. In March 1804, Thomas De Quincey, at the age ofnineteen, was suffering from rheumatic pains in his head and face, as a resultof falling asleep with wet hair. He bought a bottle of tincture of opium from adruggist in Oxford Street, and gulped down the prescribed quantity as soon as hewas back in his lodgings. ‘...and in an hour, O heavens!...what a resurrection,from its lowest depths, of the inner spirit! what an apocalypse of the worldwithin me!...here was the secret of happiness, about which philosophers haddisputed for so many ages.’De Quincey insists that the effect of opium is a sense of clarity and power, nota descent into some warm and muddled dream world. ‘The Opium Eater...feels thatthe diviner part of his nature is paramount—that is, the moral affections are ina state of cloudless serenity, and high over all the great light of the majesticintellect.’ He speaks of ‘the abyss of divine enjoyment’, of the power of opiumto build ‘out of the fantastic imagery of the brain, cities and temples, beyondthe art of Phidias and Praxiteles, beyond the splendour of Babylon andHecatombpylos’.It seems, then, that the chief quality of opium was to free De Quincey from hissense of being a victim of material reality. On the page before he takes thedrug, his account remarks: ‘It was a Sunday afternoon, wet and cheerless; and aduller spectacle this earth of ours has not to show than a rainy Sunday inLondon.’ We all know the feeling—as if the spirit is being dragged downward bysome enormous force of gravity that makes us feel weak and helpless. Opiumrestored a sense of power, of control. And part of this control was the abilityto create magnificent scenes inside his head. Which suggests that the sense ofjoy and power created by opium is not purely a physical effect, like the senseof well-being experienced by a hungry man when he eats a hot meal. It is a‘glimpse’, like the ‘exquisite pleasure’ Proust describes on tasting the cakedipped in herb tea. Blake would have said it is a glimpse of the powers of thesoul, of the Divine Imagination.De Quincey himself recognized this to be true. In the Opium Eater he describes avisit to the opera under the influence of opium, and how deeply he enjoyed themusic. ‘The mistake of most people is to suppose that it is by the ear theycommunicate with music. But this is not so; it is by the reaction of the mindupon the notices of the ear, (the matter coming from the senses, the form fromthe mind) that the pleasure is constructed...Now opium by greatly increasing theactivity of the mind generally, increases, of necessity, that particular mode ofits activity by which we are able to construct out of the raw material oforganic sound an elaborate intellectual pleasure.’And this passage also clarifies a point that Moskvitin leaves in obscurity: whatthe inner magician does to the reality of the external world. The music DeQuincey was listening to had already been written; the mind of the composer hadalready stamped it with meaning. So the opium did not transform the music intosome celestial melody; it merely increased De Quincey’s power to grasp thereality of the music. And the sense of joy and tranquillity induced by opiumsprings from the mind’s increased grasp of the reality outside us. Moskvitin’sachievement is in making it so clear that we grasp reality in a rathercomplicated way, which is analogous to a television camera translating points oflight into electrical impulses, which are then fired from a kind of gun andtransplanted back into points of light on the television screen.It is easy to make the mistake of assuming that the television screen on whichwe see ‘the world’ is a mirror faithfully reflecting what is in front of it.This mistake gives rise to the ‘passive fallacy’, the feeling that reality iswhat it is and that there is nothing much we can do about it. This is whatMeursault feels as he looks out of his window on a Sunday afternoon; it is alsowhat De Quincey felt in Oxford Street. Reality is ‘a bore’. So the spirit droopsand yawns. Opium revealed to De Quincey what his flash of rage revealed toMeursault: that a burst of energy can alter the senses, so the world suddenlybecomes ‘rich and strange’. The inner magician can alter the quality of thepicture, just as the television controls enable us to heighten the colour orincrease the definition.This is a question that must be explored more fully in the final chapter.Meanwhile, let us return to the question of the nature of the ‘inner vision’induced by opium or psychedelic drugs—or, in Brad’s case, simply by deeprelaxation. We observe that De Quincey talks about magnificent palaces andstatues—he felt that a granite statue of Rameses II in the British Museumsymbolized the serenity and strength of the mind in opium reverie—but not aboutthe usual coloured patterns that have become familiar to us from the psychedelicliterature. Coleridge also took opium, and he had visions that sound rather morelike the results of mescalin or LSD—a spectrum with a pattern like a pheasant’stail, and vivid kaleidoscopes of colours. He spoke ‘of figures, even with openeyes, of squares...and of various colours.’ In her book Opium and the RomanticImagination, Alethea Hayter remarks that ‘opium by strengthening the combiningpower and heightening the emotion, has already brought these dreams halfway toconscious literary creation’. This certainly seems to have happened in the caseof De Quincey’s weirdly complicated dreams—described in Suspiria de Profundisand The English Mail Coach, or of Coleridge’s Kubla Khan. So the effects ofopium seem to be strangely complex, ranging from simple patterns to curiousinner voyages, such as the one described in Brad’s ‘Old man’ poem. Thecommon-sense view is that drugs plunge the mind into a completely irrationalworld of nightmare, and that it would be futile to subject these visions torational analysis. Yet De Quincey and Coleridge plainly feel otherwise. AndMoskvitin’s theory provides a rationale. He would say that the tremendousselective and creative power of the inner magician is given free rein by thedrug, but moulded by the dreamer’s memory in the way that ordinary physicalperception is moulded by our expectations of the external world. By a fortunateaccident, Brad was able to release some of these powers without the use ofdrugs, and the inner magician made him aware of its presence by demonstratingthe range of its creativity.Why did it express itself in patterns rather than in ‘visionary’ paintings, likethose of Blake or Van Gogh? Here Moskvitin offers a clue. If the mechanisms ofperception are analogous to the mechanisms of a television screen, thenperception breaks down into ‘units’ of patterns. Look at a newspaper photograph;perhaps it shows a wedding, or a statesman climbing on to an aeroplane. Thereare no obvious patterns. Now look at it through a magnifying glass, and you seethat it is actually a grid of dots, and that it consists entirely of patterns. Aclose look at a television screen showing a videotape reveals the same thing; atclose quarters, the texture of the picture resembles a piece of cloth, with awarp and woof. And again, we become aware of patterns. Look at the scenery asyou drive along in a car. At first you are only aware of things—trees, fences,clouds, fields, houses. But now look at them with a painter’s eye, or as if youwere looking at a series of colour photographs. You now become aware of‘compositions’—colours and shapes blending in various ways. Your visual field ismade up of patterns. But if you were a photographer or a painter, you wouldreject most of these ‘compositions’ because they lack harmony. That gasworksspoils the composition; that cloud should be in the middle; that overhangingbranch of the tree should be on the other side...But the inner magician has nosuch problems. He can choose harmony in every composition. Brad has describedhow, as his hand reached out for a certain colour, he thought: ‘Oh no, thatcan’t be right.’ But it always was.In short, if the inner magician chooses to display his versatility as a painter,what is more natural than that he should work in coloured patterns?"},{"pageContent":"5—FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE FREEDOMDuring those last four or five days at Viittakivi, I spent as much time aspossible with Brad. My meeting with him struck me as an astonishing piece ofJungian synchronicity, and I felt I would be a fool not to take advantage of it.The stresses of the six months before I left England had convinced me that theanswers to some of our major problems lie in the right cerebral hemisphere. Ihad come to Viittakivi with the intention of trying to teach a discipline basedupon this recognition. And in Viittakivi I had met a man who seemed to be theperfect illustration of my theories. Yet there was still a great deal I wantedto know. Important discoveries are seldom made without some kind of preparation.In Brad’s case, I felt intuitively that the story had begun long before thetraumatic experience with his adopted son. So with the tape recorder switchedon, I asked him to give me an account of his life before he came to Finland.Ronald Bradley Absetz was born in Buffalo, New York, on 10 March 1928. (Ithought: of course, a Pisces: the romantic dreamer.) And he was twenty-twobefore he began to suspect that his unconscious had, so to speak, a mind of itsown.It was during the summer vacation of 1950, when he was a student at OberlinCollege. He had decided to spend the summer in the Bay area of California,working in a fruit cannery.On his first day in Oakland, he found himself a room, paid a month’s rent,bought a supply of food, and spent the evening reading the situation-vacant adsin the local newspapers. He marked several possible jobs, and prepared to go andfind work early the next morning. But when he woke up, he felt sleepy andlethargic, and decided to stay in bed. He spent most of the day in bed, and gotup in the late afternoon, in time to buy milk and bread, and the eveningnewspapers. Again, he read the situation-vacant ads and marked those that lookedpromising. The next morning, he felt the same reluctance to get out of bed.Assuming that the hitch-hike from Ohio to California had tired him more than herealized, he decided to spend the day in his room again. But when the same thinghappened for the rest of the week, he began to feel a mixture of irritation andbewilderment. By evening, he could usually work up the energy to go out and buyfood and newspapers; but when he woke up the next morning, he felt will-less andpurposeless. In his third week, he travelled to the next town, where his motherlived, to borrow money. He told her only that he was still looking for work. Andso the paralysis of the will to act continued for another three weeks. Duringthe day he wanted only to lie in bed and doze; everything seemed too mucheffort. By evening he had worked up the energy to go out; but it had evaporatedby the next morning.One day, he remembered that he had promised to prepare a bulletin for in-comingcollege freshmen back at Oberlin. A sense of guilt forced him to go out and buywax stencils, and to spend that evening typing the bulletin. This effort seemedto break the strange inner paralysis. The next morning, he went to the postoffice to send it off, then went on to a fruit cannery and got a job. And forthe rest of the vacation he worked strenuously; the mysterious lethargy wasforgotten.Back at Oberlin in the autumn, he threw himself back into his studies, and intovarious extra-curricular activities. As a student, Brad was noted for hisseriousness and enthusiasm—this is what made the period of lethargy soincomprehensible. Finally, it struck him that he had made no effort to try tounderstand what had happened, and he decided to consult the student counsellor.Her name was Frances Seaman, and she was a friend and admirer of the‘existential psychologist’ Carl Rogers. She was convinced that most people havethe capacity to grow and develop according to certain inner laws, and that herbusiness was to try to help that growth to happen. It was a good relationship,and Brad found it helpful. They often spent most of the therapeutic sessionsitting in silence—she seemed to believe naturally in ‘relaxing into the rightbrain’. And one day, as they sat in silence, Brad had an experience that soundslike Jung’s ‘active imagination’. As if in a ‘clear, strong dream’, he sawhimself beside a well, carrying a case full of tools. As he put down the case onthe ground, looking into the well, he saw a baby lying in the bottom of thewell. There was no need for him to interpret the ‘dream’; he already knew whatit meant. ‘The baby was my inner self who had been born at the same time as myouter physical self, but had been kept down at the bottom of the well; that allthe tools of analysis and understanding in that case on the ground hadserved...to bring me to this well and discover this infant form of my innerperson—and that these tools were no longer necessary. What was necessary wasthat I should lift the baby from that deep well and allow it to develop andgrow.’ The baby, he felt, was trying to express itself through his adult body.What absurd and embarrassing things could happen to an infant ‘inner self’ in anadult body? The thought threw him into a panic in which he was afraid that hewas going to disintegrate. Gradually, the panic subsided as he realized that hewas still in one piece—mentally as well as physically. This ‘vision’ convincedhim that the therapy had served its purpose and could be discontinued.When Brad told me this story, he seemed apologetic, as if unsure whether he waswasting my time; when he finished, he sat in silence for a while, then asked: ‘Idon’t know if that helps?’ It did indeed—far more than he could possiblyrealize. Suddenly, in a flash of excitement and insight, I saw the wholepattern. All the other things he had told me now fitted together.Brad’s parents had imbued him with the Protestant work ethic. They were alone ina strange country—his father’s parents were Slovaks from the Austro-Hungarianempire, and Brad’s family were the only people called Absetz in the whole UnitedStates. Salvation lay in hard work and high moral standards. Brad and hisbrother were taught to be good Christians—which meant continual involvement inchurch activities—and to behave ‘like gentlemen’. His father was unemployedthrough most of the 1930s, so the need to preserve standards seemed evengreater. At school, a slight speech defect led to much teasing—his ‘s’s soundedlike ‘sh’, so that ‘sit’ came out as ‘shit’. Speech therapy eliminated thedefect, but the shyness and loneliness remained.At the age of seventeen he enlisted for two years in the US Navy. At thetraining station in San Diego he realized ‘that no one there would know me—thatany kind of person I chose to be would be considered “he who naturally is’’ byeveryone. This insight coincided with a need I had noticed growing in myself—aneed to change, to become something more/or/else than I had been up to thattime.’ He decided to call himself by his middle name, Brad, instead of Ron. Whenhe came out of the navy, he was able to continue his education at thegovernment’s expense, and decided on Oberlin because it was one of the smallestcolleges in the United States, with a student-teacher ratio of fifteen to one(compared to about a hundred to one at the University of California.) He feltthat he needed a ‘supportive’ environment to allow his personality to developnaturally. He experienced an instinctive revulsion for ‘the rat race’. And then,in his second year at college, he set out to spend the summer vacation inOakland, California...The ‘waking dream’ of the baby in the well is another example of the ability ofBrad’s unconscious mind to solve problems when given the opportunity to expressitself. Gurdjieff made an important distinction between ‘essence’ and‘personality’. Personality is the outer self, the part that has learned to copewith other people and with the world. Essence is the inner being, and in most ofus, its development lags far behind that of the personality. Personality reactsmechanically to events and circumstances. Under stress, it tends to bend orbreak. Essence is the part of us that enables us to stand alone, to make our owndecisions, if necessary to ignore the opinions of other people and swim againstthe tide. Shy people are particularly prone to leave their essence undeveloped,because their biggest problem is to learn to blend with the crowd, to feelthemselves a part of society. They often spend so much effort on developingprotective coloration that they have no energy left for deciding what theyreally want out of life.Brad’s early training—the Protestant work ethic, the insistence on behaving‘like a gentleman’—provided the protective coloration. At school he was atypical ‘outsider’, with his speech defect and his naturally shy and introvertedtemperament. At sixteen he had his first opportunity to develop a more positive‘self-image’ when he went to live with his maternal grandmother in Canada. Thencame the navy, and a new self-confidence; Ron Absetz became Brad. At Oberlin hejoined a church group, and threw himself into voluntary and social activities.The self-image—the personality—was developing nicely.The trouble with personality is that its motivation needs to come from outside.It reacts to people, to situations, to external stimuli. Like a donkey, it needscarrots to make it break into a gallop. Which explains what happened in Oakland.Alone in a room, with no one else looking on, no one to please or impress, Bradfound his mainspring was no longer there.Machado de Assis has a story called ‘The Looking Glass’ that expresses theproblem with great clarity and precision. A young man from a small village joinsthe army and becomes a lieutenant. When he comes home in his uniform, everyoneadmires him. An aunt who owns a remote farm presses him to come and stay; sheorders the servants to address him as ‘Signor lieutenant’. But both the aunt anduncle are unexpectedly called away to sick relatives, and the slaves on the farmtake the opportunity to desert. The young soldier is left totally alone. As thedays go by he experiences a sense of emptiness and meaninglessness; hispersonality seems to be dissolving. In the large mirror in his bedroom, even hisown reflection seems blurred. Then he has an idea. He takes his uniform out ofits chest, and puts it on. Then he walks up and down in front of the mirror.Suddenly, he feels ‘real’ again. And he does this daily until his aunt and unclereturn...Machado begins his story by saying that man has two souls, one outside andlooking in, one inside and looking out. He means, of course, essence andpersonality. Like Brad at the age of twenty-two, the young lieutenant has a babyinside him looking out.The act of forcing himself to type the bulletin set in motion the wheels ofBrad’s personality; it was the equivalent of putting on his uniform and standingin front of a mirror. He once again allowed his conduct to be dictated by whatwas expected of him. And so the experience of ‘accidia’—the word Christianascetics used for these periods of inner deadness—came to an end. Most peoplewould have been glad to forget the experience, or write it off as some form ofexhaustion. Brad seems to have recognized that there was more to it than that.And in fact, the problem returned two years later. During his senior years atOberlin, Brad became involved in the student cooperative movement. The studentsrented two dormitories from the college and operated them on a basis of sharedresponsibilities. The North American Students’ Cooperative League was persuadedto move its offices to Oberlin, where it could be run by the students’cooperative. Brad agreed to serve as coordinator, with the task of forging linksbetween students’ cooperatives throughout the US and Canada. In effect, itbecame a one-man operation with Brad in charge. In December 1953 and January1954 he toured campuses throughout the US and Canada, making ambitious plans.On his return to Oberlin, he rested for a couple of days before settling down towork. And once again, the relaxation turned into lethargy, paralysis of theability to act. ‘This time I felt that the message was clear: there wassomething about the job, as exciting and challenging as it seemed, thatunconscious levels in me were forcefully rejecting...’ And after two more monthsof lethargy, he felt there was no alternative to resignation. This was somethingof a disaster for the student cooperative organization, since Brad had becomeits mainspring. The decision to abandon the path of ‘duty’ must have involved agreat deal of guilt and self-reproach. But the accidia seemed to leave noalternative.And so for a second time Brad obeyed the dictates of an obscure, unconsciousurge, which had given a sign that he needed a change of direction. He had failedto obtain his degree, having less than the required number of marks in French;he was advised to stay on for another year and re-take the French examination.Instead, he left the relative comfort and security of the college, and took ajob on a freighter as assistant cook. In the September of 1954, he sailed forEurope; his only prospective income was of periodic payments from someone whohad bought his motor bike. When this failed to materialize, he had to thinkurgently about employment. At the flat of a girl-friend in Paris, he saw abrochure about Viittakivi—the girl had vaguely intended to go, then changed hermind. Brad wrote to enquire about a scholarship and, to his delight, received inreply a friendly letter beginning ‘Dear Brad’. The writer was a girl who hadbeen a fellow student at Oberlin, and who was now teaching at Viittakivi. Thecoincidence was remarkable, since Oberlin has such a small student body. EvenBrad’s hitch-hiking trip to Finland seemed to reveal the same hand ofprovidence. At the Dutch frontier, the guard refused to let him through since hehad so little money. He turned back, intending to try another frontier crossing.The first car that came along picked him up; when he told the driver hisdestination, the driver said that his brother would be making the trip toFinland in two days’ time, and could give Brad a lift.This is how it came about that, in the January of 1955, Brad finally arrived inthe country that he would come to accept as his home. ‘My first impression ofthe far North—of snow-covered southern Sweden and Finland in January—was ofalmost endless open space on every side; with the few widely scatteredfarmhouses separated by vast stretches of snow-covered fields, rolling hills andridges that were dotted with occasional hay sheds. I felt that we weretravelling over a sparsely inhabited infinity plane. Viittakivi was also locatedin such solitude, with the spaciousness framed on two sides by the pine andspruce forests...’When the scholarship ran out, he became leader of an international work camp inLapland, then replaced the fellow Oberlin student as a part-time teacher. Whenhe was offered this job, he told the director, Elvi Saari, frankly about hisexperiences of accidia, and admitted that he could not guarantee that he wouldnot succumb to another attack. She shrugged and said that it didn’t matter; ifit happened again, they might all learn something from it. ‘That freedom to failwas one of the most important gifts anyone had ever given me.’ And,understandably, the accidia never recurred.So, in due course, Brad married a Finnish girl, became the father of threechildren, and eventually became a full-time teacher at Viittakivi, with a salaryand paid holidays. He was now in his mid thirties, and it was the first time inhis life that he experienced this kind of security. It looked as if the longsearch was over; he had found his ‘supportive environment’, and a job thatoffered the freedom for personal development. And it was at this point that hiswife had a miscarriage, and they decided to adopt a mulatto baby. So just as heseemed to have achieved security, Brad was, in fact, entering upon the mostpainful and traumatic period of his life. The result was the ‘movementimpulses’, the paintings and the poems.With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy enough to see what happened. Sinceearly childhood, Brad had been driven by the sense of obligation, of duty, thathad been instilled by his parents. And the same external necessity had continuedto be his main motivating force during his period in the navy and the first yearat Oberlin. The right brain, the creative intuition, never had a chance toexpress itself. When he had paid the month’s rent on the room in Oakland,external necessity was suddenly removed. He was ‘free’. But free for what? Thiswas a problem that faced many of his generation. Arthur Miller had written aboutit in Death of a Salesman, in the character of Biff Loman, the son who doesn’tseem to want a regular job. Jack Kerouac had also written about it, in a novelcalled On the Road which, in 1955, had still not found a publisher. A wholegeneration—in Europe as well as America—was bored with the ‘success ethic’ andthe conventional wisdom. Brad never became a drifter like Biff Loman, or adharma bum like Kerouac; but something inside him insisted that modern Americansociety and its values were not for him. That first ‘breakdown’ in Oakland was aconfrontation with his own lack of a mainspring, the second occurred when he wasrevealing his organizational abilities in the students’ cooperative. In allprobability, he would have become its permanent organizer. And the ‘other self’groaned with boredom at the prospect.Yet even the ‘supportive environment’ of Viittakivi could provide no realsolution. Again, it was the problem: freedom for what? The answer came onlyafter the death of Kalevala, his adopted son, and his wife’s schizophrenicbreakdown. In the hours of silent, relaxed concentration, lying beside her,Brad’s ‘other self’ at last succeeded in making its voice heard. And, forperhaps the first time in his life, Brad began to live and act ‘from inside’,instead of from external necessity.Expressed in this way, the achievement sounds unimportant enough. But this isbecause we continue to judge these things in terms of conventional success. In1957, publication of On the Road made Kerouac famous; it looked as if thisyounger generation of Americans had found a solution to the problem of ArthurMiller’s salesman. Yet we know that, in a practical sense, Kerouac never foundhis solution; the biography by Anne Charters shows a man who is slowly losingcontrol, drifting into breakdown and alcoholism. Timothy Leary advised hisstudents to ‘tune in and drop out’, and a whole generation followed his adviceand abandoned the rat-race to smoke pot and drop acid. The trial of the Mansonfamily in 1969 made it obvious that the hippie ethic was open to great abuse andwas not the solution Kerouac and Leary had been looking for.The same criticism could be levelled at the post-war existentialist movement inEurope. This generation had the advantage of having known Nazi oppression atfirst hand; they understood the meaning of freedom. In August 1945, when theGermans were being driven out of Paris, Camus wrote an article in theunderground newspaper Combat that began: ‘Paris is shooting all her bullets inthe August night. In this vast setting of stones and waters, all round thisriver that has reflected so much history, the barricades of freedom have oncemore been thrown up.’ And he ended: ‘This huge Paris...is bursting with all thefires of hope and suffering, it has the flame of lucid courage and all the glow,not only, of liberation, but of tomorrow’s liberty’. But the course of‘tomorrow’s liberty’ was charted by Simone de Beauvoir in her novel TheMandarins, which opens with the liberation of Paris, and in which both Camus andSartre figure as central characters. Tomorrow’s liberty has failed tomaterialize. They drink and smoke and talk all night in cellars in St Germain,they fornicate and change partners, they discuss politics—and boredom hangs overthem like a faint odour of decay. The point is reinforced in Herbert Lottman’sbiography of Camus; he tells of a heavy night’s drinking in St Germain, and how‘they continued their drinking in a bistro in the Halles neighbourhood, wept forhumanity as they walked across a bridge over the Seine. “To think that in a fewhours I’m going to talk about the writer’s responsibility,’’ Sartre remarked,referring to a lecture he was to give that day at the Sorbonne; Camus laughed.’In fact, Camus had been pitchforked into fame before he was ready for it. He wasa simple, unaffected man who liked talking and drinking with friends. He wasalso an unashamed womanizer who found it practically impossible to be faithfulto his wife. Such a way of life is hardly conducive to the ‘mandarin’ frame ofmind. And the detailed portrait of Sartre that emerges from Simone de Beauvoir’sautobiographies makes it clear that he suffered from the same problem. Gurdjieffwould have said that essence lagged behind personality. Both were compelled toassume a mantle of intellectual seriousness that would have been loose even onGoethe or Tolstoy. Camus felt the strain more than Sartre—whose leftistaffiliations made his isolation easier to bear—and when the Nobel Prize broughtthe inevitable backlash of denigration, it plunged him into a depression thatbrought him to the edge of nervous breakdown. The writing block had still notdisappeared at the time of his pointless death in the car accident. Sartre livedon for another two decades, but the major work that was to have reconciled hisexistentialist philosophy and his Marxist politics—the Critique of DialecticalReason—remained unfinished, a symbol of his inability to solve the dilemma.The generation of writers that emerged in England in the mid 1950s—and whichincluded myself—faced an analogous problem. The heroes of John Osborne, KingsleyAmis, John Wain, Iris Murdoch, John Braine, Arnold Wesker, showed the sameanti-bourgeois tendency as the heroes of existentialism or the Beat Generation.They also wanted to find a way of life that was a spontaneous expression of theurge to freedom. On the whole, the revolt of the ‘angry young men’ was a matterof negative emotional attitudes. In attacking the British ‘establishment’, theyhad chosen an easy target; and the establishment reacted in its normal manner,listening sympathetically, and then slowly absorbing the rebels. My own workdiffered from that of the other ‘angries’ in being totally unconcerned withsocial issues; The Outsider was a study in the paradox of freedom: that, asFichte says, to be free is nothing; to become free is heavenly. Its success wasgreater than anyone expected—it had been translated into twenty or so languagesbefore the end of the decade—and convinced me for a short time that the problemof inner freedom is of interest to an enormous number of people. Criticsdescribed us as the representatives of a new generation, while one journalistdenounced us as ‘messiahs of the milk-bars’. It was interesting and exciting tobe regarded as ‘intellectual leaders’, and to join in discussions on thewriter’s responsibility in Encounter and Les Temps Modernes. But I think thatmost of us had the same sense of incongruity that Sartre and Camus experiencedas they walked back from their night’s drinking. And it soon became clear to methat there was no enormous audience waiting to join in the discussion abouthuman freedom; in England there is not even a small audience. (Probably thesituation was the same in France, but disguised by the success of‘existentialist’ catchwords.) At all events, as I watched the angry young menturn into successful middle-aged men, I could see clearly that this problemcould only be solved on the individual and personal level; political revolt isirrelevant. Both Camus and Sartre had been neatly hog-tied by their earlierradicalism. Camus came to see that rebellion is a political roundabout thatrevolves back into the same old tyranny; too ashamed to admit that he hadoutgrown his leftism, he found himself in an intellectual cul-de-sac. Sartreaccused Camus of being a reactionary; but he paid for his own refusal tore-examine his political convictions by congealing into a grotesque attitude ofpermanent indignation, shaking his fist at some abstract Authority. Wherepolitics was concerned, he seemed determined to be guided by his emotions.The point I am making should be clear. Nothing is plainer, more simple, moredirect, than the impulse to freedom. And nothing is simpler than taking thefirst step, which consists of rejection: of conventional ties, of thebourgeoisie, of the establishment. But this only produces negative freedom, ofthe kind Fichte meant when he said: ‘To be free is nothing.’ Most rebellions endhere. The rebel knows clearly what he doesn’t want; but he is less sure aboutwhat he wants. Some feel that since this is a ‘spiritual’ problem, the answershould be sought in religion. But there is no evidence that varioustwentieth-century writers who accepted this solution—Chesterton, Eliot, Greene,Waugh, Lewis—have found it a source of positive freedom. Thomas Merton, whofollowed his impulse of retreat to its logical conclusion—behind the walls of aTrappist monastery—seems to have been more frustrated as a monk than he was as alayman. The problem was still waiting for him in his cell.When Brad experienced the paralysis of will in Oakland, he had taken the stepinto negative freedom. He retreated into the security of university life, butrepeated the rejection process when he threw up the post of secretary of thestudent’s cooperative. The trip to Europe was an attempt to find out what to donext. But his arrival at Viittakivi was no solution. Admittedly, Viittakivi hadbecome a centre for people involved in the same search; most of those who gothere feel that modern civilization has taken the wrong turning, and that lifemust somehow recover its individual dimension. But although the existence ofplaces like Viittakivi guarantees a forum for discussion of the problem, it canno more provide solutions than can a Trappist monastery. It was Brad’srecognition of this fact that led him to leave Viittakivi after his marriage,and to plan to move to India. The arrival of a family made this impracticable,and it is difficult not to feel that he would have found it ultimatelyunsatisfying—Brad was in search of an ideal, not of a country. He returned toViittakivi as a full-time instructor. And the ordeal of the death of his adoptedson and the illness of his wife finally revealed the solution, and provided thestep into positive freedom. In those hours of inner suspension, lying beside hiswife, simultaneously attentive and relaxed, that ‘other self’ found that itsvoice could be heard, and that it would no longer be ignored or overruled by thepractical ego. Brad had, in fact, taken a vital step towards solving a problemthat has preoccupied artists, philosophers and poets for almost two centuries."},{"pageContent":"6—A CENTURY OF MISUNDERSTANDINGLet us, at this point, look back at the nature of that problem.It is, as Moskvitin recognized, the problem of ‘visionary consciousness’, ofstates of mind in which we become aware of what Wordsworth called ‘unknown modesof being’. No doubt men have always longed for these states of visionaryconsciousness, and some of the saints have achieved them. But where Europeanliterature is concerned, they appear for the first time in the writings of theromantics, in the poetry of Wordsworth, Blake and Novalis, the fiction of JeanPaul Richter and E.T.A. Hoffmann. (Moskvitin points out that Hoffman’s vision ofgreen snakes seems to be a glimpse of the actual mechanism of this vision.)In its most basic form, it is simply a feeling of excitement, of happiness andaffirmation. This is accompanied by an insight that seems to be purelyobjective: that reality is infinitely deeper and richer than it appears toordinary perception: that, in some paradoxical sense, everyday consciousness isa liar. Early romantics tried to capture the feeling in images of sensual bliss;this is Novalis, from Heinrich von Ofterdingen:‘He approached the basin, which surged and quivered in endless colours. Thisfluid, which was not hot but cool, covered the walls of the cave, where itemitted only a faint bluish light. He dipped his hand into the basin and wet hislips. It was as though a spirit breathed through him, and he felt deeplyrefreshed and strengthened. An irresistible longing to bathe seized him; heundressed and stepped down into the basin. It seemed as if a sunset cloud wasenveloping him; a heavenly sensation flowed through his soul; with voluptuousdelight countless thoughts strove to mingle within him. New images never seenbefore arose and interfused and became visible around him, and every wave of thelovely element clung to him like a tender blossom. The waves appeared to becharming girls dissolved, which momentarily embodied themselves as they touchedthe youth.’‘It was as if a spirit breathed through him...’ The sexual imagery of the finalsentence is not accidental; the romantics associated this ‘heavenly sensation’with sexual bliss, the delight of feeling a girl’s naked body against one’s bareskin. The romantic ecstasy has much in common with sexual ecstasy. In thesemoments, it is natural for us to compare the sensation to a surge of electriccurrent that causes a bulb to glow twice as brightly. The romantic was inclinedto compare it to the wind. In The Prophet, Pushkin likens the poet’s heart to alive coal; but a coal has to wait for the wind to make it glow. The force ofShelley’s ‘Ode to the west wind’ springs from our recognition that he is reallyspeaking about this vital current:> Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is...In ‘Winter’, Pushkin describes the far more common sensation of the poet’s senseof helplessness when the wind fails to blow:> Slow drop by drop I drink my boredom’s bitter poison.> > I try a book; the eyes glide down the page—in vain.> > My thoughts are far away...This is the problem that discouraged the romantics: that there is no infalliblemethod of ‘raising the wind’, of controlling the current. Yet in Pushkin, we canobserve that the problem is, to some extent, self-created. Like a spoilt child,he feels that life has no right to bore him—how dare it make him swallow thisnasty medicine? And the next line of Shelley’s poem—‘What if my leaves arefalling like its own!’—betrays the same note of self-pity. The romantics ingeneral were inclined to raise indignant wails of reproach, like a childcomplaining that its soup is half-cold. Proust explains smugly that he hasalways been subject to nervous debility, and is liable to suffer agonies ofmigraine and insomnia if he drinks tea too late at night...Yet in his vastautobiographical novel, Proust came closer than any of the romantics to grippingthe problem of ‘vision’ in the forceps of analysis. He recognized theessentially paradoxical nature of the experience: how we can be feeling boredand listless one moment, and then quite suddenly experience a momentaryimmortality, a sense of power, of insight, of vision. What is more, we are notswept into these moments on the crest of a wave of ecstasy or vitality; they areonly a hair’s breadth away from the experience of fatigue and boredom. As Prouststands outside the public lavatory in the Champs-Elysees, waiting for hischaperone, he observes that ‘the old damp walls of the entrance...emitted acool, fusty smell which...filled me with a pleasure of a different kind fromother pleasures, which leave one more unstable, incapable of grasping them, ofpossessing them, a pleasure that was solid and consistent, on which I could leanfor support, delicious, soothing, rich with a truth that was lasting,unexplained and sure. I should have liked...to endeavour to penetrate the charmof this impression which had seized hold of me, and remaining there motionless,to explore this antiquated emanation which invited me not to enjoy the pleasurewhich it was offering me only as a bonus, but to descend into the underlyingreality which it had not yet disclosed to me.’ Proust recognizes that his normalgrasp of reality is somehow false, and that moments like this bring a glimpse ofanother mode of understanding. This is what is so exciting in Proust, in spiteof the hypochondria and self-indulgence: his recognition that this ‘otherreality’ is so close. This is quite unlike the exquisite self-pity of Shelley’s:> Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,> > Stains the white radiance of Eternity,...with its implication that we would all be better off if we could escape this‘dim vast vale of tears’. Proust can somehow see that ordinary, everyday lifecould become a continuous delight if we could learn that trick of looking atthings from a slightly different angle.We now know something that Proust was in no position to know: that the change ofangle is simply a movement of a couple of inches from one side of the brain tothe other. (And I must emphasize that doubts about split-brain theory make nodifference whatever; the difference between the ‘two selves’ does exist, whetheror not they can be closely identified with the left and right.) All that hashappened as he breathes in the smell of damp and fungus is that he is suddenlyperceiving it directly, with ‘primal perception’, and not—as T.E. Lawrencesays—filtered through and made typical by thought. As a hypochondriac, Proustwas always creating false problems and tensions, working himself up into statesof anxiety based on self-doubt—that is, the ego’s sense of its own inadequacy.These ‘glimpses’ that came through smells and tastes—or even from stumbling on acracked paving stone—were ‘intimations of immortality’ that by-passed the ‘falseself’. This becomes clear in the paving stone episode in the final volume, whereProust’s narrator again experiences the ‘all is well’ feeling as he ismomentarily transported back to St Mark’s in Venice. He remarks that his doubtsabout his literary gift suddenly vanished ‘as if by magic’: ‘I had followed nonew train of reasoning, discovered no decisive argument, but the difficultieswhich had seemed insoluble a moment ago had lost all importance.’ That slightchange of angle has made them evaporate: and Proust recognizes that he hasby-passed chains of reasoning and arguments—left-brain activities—for some formof direct perception.These are not matter of ‘mysticism’ or poetics, but a centcal—perhaps thecentral—problem of philosophy. The problem is this. Reason seems to lead us tothe truth about the world. The dialogues of Socrates are a series ofdemonstrations of how reason can lead to truth. Yet when we try to grasp theworld by reason, we find ourselves involved in all kinds of problems andcontradictions, and the truth seems further away than ever. Plato suggested whatis happening in his myth of the cave—that human beings were like prisonerschained in a cave, seeing only the shadows cast by a fire on the wall andmistaking them for reality. If they could be unchained and allowed outside, theywould be staggered by the real world... But, thought Plato, reason can revealthis ‘real world’ to us—we only have to be educated to use our minds instead ofliving ‘by rule of thumb’.This belief of Plato was to cause much agony to later philosophers (for, asWhitehead remarked, western philosophy is little more than a series of footnotesto Plato). We can see why if we think of Proust’s experience with the madeleineor the broken paving stone. These brought that sudden flash of direct insight,quite simply a sense of reality—like the prisoner released from the cave. Yetreason obviously played no part in the process. The more we reason, the more weseem to become entangled on our own logic. Dostoevsky experienced the ‘sense ofreality’ when he was reprieved in front of a firing squad; what had that to dowith reason? Yet to reject reason is no answer either; we only have to turn toPlato’s dialogues to see that reason is precisely what he claimed—the mostreliable gateway to truth.From Descartes onward, modern philosophy has found itself in an apparentlyinsoluble dilemma. Descartes believed that it should be possible to create aphilosophy that should be as reliable as geometry or mathematics, and simply bysubjecting everything to the test of reason—that is, of doubt. And he found itdifficult to get beyond the basic proposition, ‘I think therefore I am.’ What ifGod is a conjuror, and the universe is a box of conjuring tricks, intended todeceive us? How could we tell? Hume pointed out that even the connection betweencause and effect could be a conjuring trick. If the conjuror, for example, madewater-falls go up instead of down, we would assume that to be ‘natural’ andinevitable. Berkeley went on to argue that, when considered from this strictlyrational point of view, the real world can be doubted out of existence. Andindeed, if the game is played according to the rules of left-brain logic,Berkeley and Hume are irrefutable. ‘Sceptical logic’, logic where everything hasto be ‘proved’, can be compared to one of those mathematical games where youhave to join up a number of dots without lifting the pencil from the paper orretracing any line. What could be sillier than saying, ‘I think, therefore Iam’? I am just as aware that ‘I am’ when I lie in bed, perfectly contented andunthinking, a few moments after waking up, or when I am involved in someemergency that forces me to act without thinking; in fact, even more so. DoctorJohnson went straight to the point when he tried to refute Berkeley by kicking astone; he was demonstrating that, where the business of experience is concerned,reason is the least important of our faculties. In effect, we see the worldsimultaneously through two pairs of eyes, one belonging to reason, the other tointuition.Kant instinctively recognized that this was the solution to the problem; his‘Copernican revolution’ amounts to grasping that our minds add something to whatwe experience, so the rationalist method of interrogating reality—as if what oursenses tell us is the whole truth and nothing but—is based upon a fallacy. It israther as if a detective interrogating a suspect should suddenly realize that heis subject to hallucinations and ‘voices’, so that half the testimony may be hisown invention. Kant recognized that our senses are ‘active’. They do not‘contemplate’ reality; they play their part in creating it. The ‘you’ who looksat a clock to tell the time is not the whole you, but merely a partial self, aleft-brain façade; and if you try to construct a philosophy on the testimony ofthis self, you will find yourself involved in some baffling contradictions.Experience happens to you; but you also happen to experience.So when Camus’s Meursault looks out of the window and feels that life is‘absurd’, or when Sartre’s Roquentin decides that the truth about reality isglimpsed in flashes of ‘nausea’, they are falling into the same trap as Hume andDescartes. They have not reached their conclusions through a process ofphilosophical argument, but by a kind of immediate perception: that is, by aleft-brain interpretation of direct experience. All true philosophy—no matterhow abstract and complex it sounds on paper—has this foundation in thephilosopher’s immediate experience of his own life. The fact that aperception—like ‘nausea’—is immediate and powerful does not mean that it istrue.‘Nausea’ is one of the commoner human experiences. It happens to us, in a mildform, every time we become tired or discouraged, and feel ‘mediocre, accidental,mortal’. And nausea is only possible because we are capable of ‘taking stock’ ofour situation. If you play a game with an insect, blocking its path with a twig,it never seems to become discouraged; it will continue indefatigably trying tofind an unblocked path until it collapses with exhaustion. A man becomesdiscouraged long before because he ‘contemplates’ his situation; he may even getdiscouraged before he starts. The purpose of this faculty—of taking stock—is toenable us not to waste vital energy. But in practice, it causes us to waste agreat deal. We exaggerate; we become over-excited; we succumb to anxiety andself-pity. In short, the rational ego loses touch with its intuitive partner.They could be compared to a married couple who go for a picnic; but the husbandis so impatient and preoccupied that he walks on ahead until they have lostsight of one another. Unfortunately, the wife is carrying the bag with the food;so the husband starves—as the rational ego starves and wilts when it loses touchwith intuition. When Marcel tastes the madeleine dipped in tea, he experiencesin a flash of insight the absurdity of this situation.This is the essence of the problem: ‘losing touch’. But what is the solution? Igrasp it instinctively whenever something interests me deeply. My rational egois eager to pursue the matter, but it makes quite sure that the intuitions arenot left behind. I can observe the same process when I am listening to music orenjoying poetry. I deliberately slow down the left-brain ego; I ‘pay attention’,I try to apprehend it simultaneously with reason and intuition, with the mindand the emotions. And if I can persuade them to cooperate, I suddenly find thatI am grasping reality in a new way. It has taken on a third dimension—adimension of reality. And this is enough to make me aware that what I normallytake for reality is not real at all. It is a mere surface, a kind of stagescenery. It bears the same relation to reality that paste jewellery bears toreal diamonds.Now this is obviously the experience that Plato was speaking about—when theprisoner is unchained and taken out into the sunlight. Reason can prevent usfrom taking the shadows for reality. Proust spent most of his life in a state ofemotional upheaval. The whole central episode of his novel—the love affair withAlbertine—is an example of neurotic self-indulgence. Proust recognized that thistendency became dominant when his mother failed to kiss him goodnight, and hewas allowed to spend the night in her bed. He possessed an exceptionallypowerful intellect; but it was the slave of his emotions. Plato recognized thatmost men are the slaves of emotion and impulse and physical sensation; this iswhy he emphasized the importance of reason. But reason cannot produce the flashof ‘absurd good news’, the peak experience. It can only point us in the rightdirection.The crucial step is to recognize the ‘negative intentionality’ that producesthese confusions, and that leads inevitably to the process of ‘losing touch’.Most practical activities involve some element of obsession. Let us say that Ihave decided to write a letter before dinner. As I write, I begin to feelhungry. Nevertheless, I tell myself that I shall enjoy my food more when I knowthe letter is finished; so I press on. Finally, I feel rather depressed andexhausted. And when I re-read the letter the next day, after a good night’ssleep, I can see that I have allowed my hunger to influence my mood, and thatthis is reflected in the opinions I express.What has happened is that my hunger has started a process of ‘negativefeedback’. It has made me feel that it is not worth making much effort; this inturn has reduced my pleasure in writing, which in turn increases my feeling ofboredom and impatience. I allow myself to make less and less effort, yet I failto see the connection between this act of ‘rejection’, of impatience, and myincreasing boredom. I feel that the letter is boring. In other words, I feelthat I am reacting in a rational and logical way to an obstacle in the externalworld. As my pressure sinks, I fail to see that I am releasing it, asdeliberately as if I had pushed a matchstick into the valve of a tyre.The real problem is that the process tends to be self-perpetuating. Modern manis permanently in a hurry. Because I am in a hurry, I fail to bring enoughenergy and concentration to bear on some specific task, and the task begins tostrike me as futile and boring. And since most of my life is made up of similartasks, I experience this mildly irritating sense of boredom from morning tillnight; I begin to accept it as the basic condition of modern life. My attitudebecomes a habit. I contemplate tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, and suddenlyI wonder if it is all really worth the effort. Is this dreary repetition whatthey mean by ‘living’? And as my ‘heart sinks’, I realize that if this state ofboredom persists, then I am going to lose my grip on life. I may begin toexperience a strangled sense of panic, of futility, a terrified conviction thatlife is ‘vanity of vanities’. And because I lack insight into the process ofnegative intentionality, I remain totally unaware that all this is an absurdmisunderstanding.We also have tantalizing flashes of insight into how easy it would be to reversethe whole process. Something strikes me as so interesting that I focus upon itthe total weight of my attention. Suddenly, I experience a curious inner glow, arefreshing trickle of optimism and excitement. Involuntarily, my attentionincreases. For a moment, I glimpse the astonishing truth that I merely have toput ‘interest’ into any experience in order to make it ‘interesting’. For amoment, I grasp that the power and the glory lie behind my eyes. But thisinsight is altogether too strange, too bewildering, and a moment later, I haveslipped back into the old habit of passivity.But there are also times when this experience can be held on to. Perhaps, likeProust, I come to associate happiness with a particular place—or, like a childat Christmas, with some particular time. Because I am convinced that the placeis interesting, I increase the intensity of my gaze; and this has the effect ofbringing an instant, delicious flash of meaning, like the faint tingle thatoccurs when you place your tongue against the terminal of a torch battery. Itmay happen when I listen to a particular piece of music, or encounter a certainsmell or taste. When my senses have become sharpened and focused in this manner,they may surprise me by producing unexpected flashes of intensity. I peer intothe salad to see whether there is any avocado left, and suddenly the green ofthe lettuce and the red of the radishes and tomatoes glows and deepens, and thecolours enter into combination with the smell of vinegar to produce that samedeep, satisfying sense of reality that Proust experienced in the Champs Elysees,a feeling of delight that they merely exist. In such moments we become awarethat our ‘normal consciousness’ consists mainly of a buzzing cloud of emotionslike a swarm of gnats, and that most of them are completely unnecessary. It isthen that we glimpse the truth that ‘interest’ has nothing to do withcircumstances; that the view from a yacht in the Mediterranean or the edge ofthe Grand Canyon is no more interesting than the view of a gasworks inManchester or the cracks in an old shoe. For the length of the insight, thephrase ‘perception is intentional’ becomes a more exciting piece of good newsthan anything in the world’s scriptures.And now we are near the very heart of the matter, the fundamental mechanisms ofvisionary consciousness. Let me try to clarify them with a case history.In October 1975, an eighteen-year-old student named Robert Poulin walked intothe classroom of his school in Ottawa, and opened fire with a shotgun, woundingseven students. Then he turned the gun on himself and blew his brains out.Poulin lived in the basement of his parents’ home; his mother found smokepouring from the window and alerted the fire brigade. They discovered thehalf-burnt corpse of a seven-teen-year-old girl on the bed; she had been rapedand stabbed to death. Poulin had apparently spoken to her at the bus stop—shewas a neighbour—and persuaded her that he had something important to show her inhis basement.Police discovered piles of sex magazines, a box of women’s underwear, hard corepornography, and a blow-up sex doll. Poulin’s diary made it clear that he hadbeen brooding about sex for a long time, and that he believed himself to beunattractive to women. He decided that, sooner or later, he would have to commita rape. When he bought the sex doll for $30, he confided to his diary: ‘Now I nolonger think I will have to rape a girl...’ But on the day the doll arrived, henoted: ‘Doll a big disappointment.’We may also surmise that his final hours with seventeen-year-old Kim Rabot—agirl whose name was included in a list of possible rape victims—were also ananti-climax. He had been brooding and dreaming about sex for years; it was asubject that was permanently in his thoughts. Obviously, he expected ‘the realthing’ to be some kind of tremendous revelation, an almost mystical ecstasy. Itwould have been impossible for any experience to have lived up to suchexpectations. After the rape, he must have felt like the victim of a confidencetrickster. There was a bloody naked corpse on the bed, somehow too real, tooordinary, to be sexually exciting. Then what had happened to the fever, thedesire, the ecstasy? It must have seemed total illusion—part of life’s strategyto ensure the continuation of the species. For a man who has ‘seen through’ thefraud, suicide must have seemed the only solution.Poulin is abnormal, yet his story is only ‘normal’ experience magnified fiftytimes. We are all familiar with the way that reality seems an anti-climax afterour expectations. A child looks forward to a birthday present for months, yetfeels bored with it within days, even hours. We seem to spend a great deal ofour lives saying, ‘Is that all?’ Disappointments are usually small and quicklyforgotten, but they occur with great frequency. In fact, you could say that theyare part of the essential texture of experience. Disappointment seems built intothe sex act itself. A man who catches a glimpse of a girl taking off her clothesfeels that she is infinitely desirable, yet if he makes love to her, he realizesthat this is not the girl who caused him so much excitement. It is as if aswindler has cunningly substituted a paste jewel for a real one, or bundles ofpaper for pound notes. As Poulin tried to make love to his blow-up doll, it musthave struck him that sex is largely our imagination. Yet he still believed thata real girl would deliver the promised ecstasy. If this failed to materialize,the result must have been conviction that life is a tissue of illusions. Thefeeling was given its definitive expression in literature in Villiers del’Isle-Adam’s Axel, where the hero persuades a girl to enter into a suicide pacton the grounds that no reality ever lives up to its promise, and that even theirlove will degenerate into a mere ‘relationship’.Yet before we accept this horribly plausible notion, we should also recall thosemoments when an experience did live up to expectation. If life is an illusion,how can we account for these? And what of the experiences that came as apleasant surprise, when we were not expecting them, and that seemed oddlyperfect, without a note of discord? If we analyse such experiences, we can seethat this was because there was no inner conflict, no ‘mistrust’, no element ofdoubt. In fact, the experiences that seem ‘unreal’ or disappointing are those inwhich we allow ourselves to remain, to some extent, passive spectators. Once webecome involved, once we throw the weight of our own enthusiasm and vitalityinto the experience, it becomes self-evidently real and satisfying.As soon as we begin to examine this problem through the microscope ofphenomenology—the detached observation of inner states—we can begin to observeMoskvitin’s ‘visionary mechanisms’ in action. Moskvitin recognized that it is wewho transform the ‘sparks’, the raw material of perception, into what weactually see. Perception is a sculptor, a moulder of reality.Let us examine this mechanism more closely. It is again important to grasp thatthe statement that ‘we transform the raw material’ does not mean that we createreality. The meaning is already there. When I bite into an apple, I know that itwill taste like an apple; even if I try to convince myself that it is an orangeor a pear, it will still taste like an apple. The taste is already there. All Ican do is to increase or decrease its taste, like turning the volume knob on aradio up or down. If I am anxious and preoccupied, I may not even notice whetherit is an apple or a pear. But if I am hungry, and I concentrate my fullattention on the apple, I can experience its smell, its texture, its flavour, sothat it becomes the most delicious apple I have ever tasted.Perception, then, is intentional; I fire it like an arrow. If I am feeling boredand passive, then I can scarcely muster the energy to pull back the string, andthe arrow falls a few feet away. But if my expected reward—the taste of theapple or of a girl’s lips—fills me with desire, I draw the bowstring back as faras it will go, and the arrow thuds into its target.In many cases, I add this element of vitality so spontaneously that I am unawarethat I am doing so. I go for a walk on a spring morning. The air smells sopleasant, the breeze is so fresh, that my senses reach out eagerly forexperience. I am only half-aware of this intentional element, and am inclined toattribute my pleasure to some other cause—that it has been a long winter, that Ihave had a good night’s sleep, that this morning really is exceptionallyfresh... The next day I take the same walk and find it disappointing. In fact,my conviction that I have only to relax and enjoy myself means that I am puttingless vitality into the experience. Perhaps I read some depressing item in themorning paper before I came out, and this makes me feel: ‘All this loveliness isan illusion—life is really rather grim...,’ and the element of ‘mistrust’ makesme ‘shrink’ from the experience instead of running to meet it, as I did theprevious day.My own view of myself, my ‘self-image’, also plays an important part in myresponse to experience. Robert Poulin was a shy teenager, riddled withself-doubt. He spent a great deal of his time bored and exhausted, shrinkingfrom direct experience, preferring the world of his imagination. So even if hisvictim had been willing to cooperate, he would have been in no position to getthe most from the experience. The element of ‘mistrust’ would thrown him into anautomatic stance of embarrassment and passivity. He would have failed to throwthe weight of intentionality into the experience, like a boxer failing to puthis weight into a punch. This is what Eliot was talking about in ‘The HollowMen’:> Between the idea> > And the reality...> > Between the emotion> > And the response> > Falls the shadowThe ‘shadow’ is the twinge of mistrust, the ‘shrinking’, the conviction thatthis is all an illusion...The male who is convinced that the female is his by right—or, for that mattervice versa—throws the full weight of his conviction into the experience and, asa result, finds it far more satisfying. (Even so, he may allow hisintentionality to become diluted by force of habit, or by some other tension orpreoccupation, and so lose the essence of the experience.)We are speaking now of the basic ‘intentional rule’ that governs all experience.We can see it in operation when we lie in bed on a cold winter morning, knowingwe have to get up in five minutes. We observe it when we sink into a hot bathafter a hard day’s work. We simply allow the mind to focus upon our presentsituation, instead of ‘wandering’. We can see the principle in operation in thestory of Tom Sawyer whitewashing the fence. Tom does not want to whitewash thefence; he wants to be elsewhere. So his mind is ‘elsewhere’, and he finds thetask unrewarding. But by whistling and looking happy, he convinces his friendsthat he is enjoying himself. And when they have bribed him into letting themtake turns, they actually enjoy it. Why? Because, expecting to enjoy it, theyfocus wholly upon the experience; their minds are not ‘elsewhere’. It is as ifthey are holding up a mirror in which they can see their own faces.A sense of optimism does it just as effectively. We have all observed how, afterwe have received some good news, the world seems to take on a warmer, richercolouring. If this experience is analysed more closely, it can be seen that thegood news has filled us with a conviction that the world is a delightful place,full of hidden meanings. It is the attitude that children take towardsexperience: an assumption that whatever happens is bound to be interesting.And if I take the trouble to observe myself in these moods of expectancy andreceptivity, I notice something else. I am now free of ‘doubt’, of the ‘shadow’,of the assumption of meaninglessness that so often drains me of optimism andvitality. When I become aware of this, I can see that this assumption is not aconscious belief—as it must have been when Poulin decided on suicide. It is atacit assumption, a kind of hesitancy. But it has upon my consciousness exactlythe same effect that self-doubt would have upon an actor delivering his lines ora pianist interpreting a Beethoven sonata: it somehow robs the whole thing ofconviction. This is what Blake meant when he wrote:> If the sun and moon should doubt> > They’d immediately go out.He recognized that ‘doubt’ is not simply a matter of the intellect, but is woveninto the fabric of consciousness. Goethe was expressing the same insight when hemade Mephistopheles describe himself as ‘the spirit that negates’.But what is the precise nature of this ‘doubt’? Kierkegaard would say that it isthe essential ‘angst’ of the human spirit contemplating the mystery of itsexistence; Sartre would say that it is a recognition that consciousness is akind of emptiness; Samuel Beckett would say it is man’s realization that lifehas no meaning. But in that case, how do we explain moments like Proust’s‘glimpse’ in the Champs-Elysees, which make the doubts seem suddenly absurd?This question forms the subject of a remarkable essay called ‘The Process ofThought’, which was presented to the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis in1971 by Dr Howard B. Miller. I have written of Miller elsewhere,1 so shall hereoffer only a brief summary of his central idea. When studying the curativepowers of hypnosis, Miller was led to ask what factor in the nervous systemexplains why a person under deep hypnosis can control bleeding and even certaindiseases. This led him into considering the philosophical question: what isthought? The psychologist’s answer to that question is: the flow of images,ideas, emotions, that take place when the brain is conscious. Miller concludedthat this definition is inadequate; he wrote: ‘However, research and experimentshave led me to consider and propose the existence of a powerful factor behindthis so-called stream of thought. This power seems to be a controlling andcreative one...’ When we close our eyes and look inside ourselves, says Miller,we seem to be watching a kind of television screen, on which appears acontinually changing flux of symbols, emotions and pictures. But who is lookingat the screen? Who is this ‘you’ who is observing it?He goes on to mention Wilder Penfield’s experiments in which an electronicprobe, touching certain areas of the brain during surgery, can cause the patientto re-live, in the utmost detail, events from the past. The brain is obviously agigantic library, a computer with an incredible amount of storage space.And this, says Miller, is our problem. As Proust knew only too well, thecomputer cannot be persuaded to allow us immediate access to ‘remembrance ofthings past’. Moreover, it seems to prefer to fill our heads with thoughts andimages we could well do without. And when I would prefer to taking mentalvoyages, it keeps me drearily trapped in the present. I am supposed to be themaster of my brain and body; in fact, I seem to be their slave. No wonderphilosophers are always asking ‘Who am I?’ It is the cry of despair of a man whois not master in his own house...This, says Miller, is a mistake of enormous magnitude, the mistake that lies atthe heart of all our problems. To begin to recognize this mistake, we only haveto close our eyes and proceed to conjure up different scenes—yourself on thebeach, complete with the smell of seaweed and the warmth of the sun, thenyourself at the foot of a mountain, standing in the snow and looking up at theclouds...We ourselves select and change the image on the television screen. Theobserver who looks at the screen is ‘the essential you’—or, as Miller prefers tocall it, ‘the Unit of Pure Thought’. Our mental processes seem confused andrandom—like a cinema projector running wild—only because we fail to make theeffort of control. Thoughts are controlled and created by the Unit of PureThought, the ‘You’. It is the lack of this awareness, says Miller, that hasprevented us from picking up the reins and taking control of our own brains.Miller’s ideas are very closely connected indeed with that central recognitionof Husserl that thought is intentional, and with Moskvitin’s insight into theway in which a kind of hidden artist ‘paints’ reality in front of our eyes. ButMiller has gone boldly to the heart of the matter, and stated: ‘You are themaster of your brain and your thoughts.’How did we get into this confused situation? For millions of years, humanevolution trained us for action, not for thought. When a hunter is engaged inthe excitement of the chase, he does not need to ask, ‘Who am I?’ He knows. Heis aware of his power to transform reality, that he decides whether the spearwill plunge into the animal’s side or its neck. His ‘I’ knows it is in control.Modern man feels the same when he is driving at ninety miles an hour or peeringdown the sights of a rifle. But when he is standing on a train, clinging to astrap, or waiting for the traffic lights to change, he becomes passive. Hespends so much of his life regarding himself as passive—‘mediocre, accidentalmortal’—that it becomes a part of his self-image, something he is inclined toaccept as a basic premise of his existence. So when certain situations make himaware that he is the ‘master’—love-making, drinking, fast driving—he is inclinedto regard these insights as some kind of pleasant delusion. And he attempts toduplicate them by simply repeating the experience, and sometimes becoming analcoholic or a traffic fatality in the process.It is true that thinking can produce the same sense of mastery, but this is sucha recent activity in the evolutionary time-scale that most of us do ithesitantly and badly. Thinking seldom involves much sense of urgency, so we failto do it with much conviction. The result is that it has become a primarilyleft-brain activity—whereas in fact, real thinking, the kind we encounter in thedialogues of Plato, involves the close cooperation of both halves of thebrain—like two men at either end of a double-handed saw.Miller believes that we have the power to change the situation. We can usethought to explore and analyse all our other vital processes. And once we haveachieved the insight that thought is ‘intentional’, we can begin to use it tocontrol our perceptions and feelings. The history of religion teaches us thatsuch an insight really can enable us to gain control. If Proust had reallygrasped the meaning of his own insight—that he was not accidental, mediocre,mortal—he would have been able to duplicate the experience at will, instead ofwaiting for it to occur by chance. The Hindu mystic Ramakrishna was able tograsp the meaning of the insight when, in a state of despair, he tried to killhimself with a sword, and experienced the vision of meaning that Graham Greeneexperienced when he played Russian roulette; but Greene, like Proust, failed tohold on to the meaning, while Ramakrishna was able to summon it at will,producing states of visionary ecstasy. These violent methods, while obviouslyeffective, are dangerous. The essence of the Buddha’s teaching is that we canachieve insight—‘enlightenment’—simply by learning to use the mind and willcorrectly. Violent methods—even the self-torment of the Christian ascetics—isquite unnecessary. And what is so exciting about the insights of Hudson, Maslow,Sperry, Ornstein, Miller is that they reveal the existence of a scientific routeto ‘enlightenment’. Perhaps the most unexpected development of our time is thatreligion and science are ceasing to point in opposite directions.The essence of these insights always amounts to the same thing: that our mentaland physical states are far more within our control than we realize. The humansituation could be compared to that of a passenger in a car that gets stuck inthe mud, and who is asked by the driver to give it a push. But he is convincedthat he is too weak to be of any use; so he pushes half-heartedly, and hisconviction is reinforced when nothing happens. But finally, driven to efforts byshouts of ‘Push!’, he exerts all his strength, and the car shoots forward. Andfrom then on, he will never make the mistake of assuming he is impotent.An example of this process is cited by Abraham Maslow. When he began talking tohis students about ‘peak experiences’, they began to recollect peak experiencesfrom their own lives—experiences that they had already half forgotten. And assoon as they made a habit of thinking and talking about peak experiences, theybegan having peak experiences all the time. The peak experience is, in fact,merely ‘committed’ experience, experience in which the ego exerts its fullweight, instead of ‘hanging back’ in the conviction that it is merely aspectator. As soon as Maslow’s students began to recall past peak experiences,they discovered that ‘peaks’ are not some kind of divine visitation. We causethem by being optimistic and interested.We also cause the opposite of the peak experience: the sinking feeling, thesudden sense of mistrust. This is based upon the conviction that life is anendless struggle against impossible odds, a drearily repetitious obstacle race.This is dangerous because it looks so plausible; for indeed, life does consistmainly of repetition. And in moods of optimism, we see that this is no reasonfor despondency. A great actor can transform Hamlet into a new play; a greatconductor can make the Beethoven Fifth sound as if it is being played for thefirst time. It is no objection to these works to say that they consist of arepetition of the same words or notes. On the contrary: the fact that theyalready exist on paper allows the interpreter a degree of freedom that would beimpossible if he were forced to improvise.We must grasp this central fact: that most of our problems are self-inflicted,caused by ‘negative feedback’. We allow some dreary prospect to cause a sinkingfeeling, then accept the sinking feeling as evidence that life is difficult anddangerous—‘We can’t win.’ Our descendants will look back with astonishment onour naivety. They will have learned the crucial lesson: that external events mayor may not be controllable; we choose our reaction to them.1 Frankenstein’s Castle, p. 104 et seq.

I place myself in areceptive frame of mind, and address a kind of question to my memory. And if Iam relaxed and receptive, memory will send up the answer immediately. The tuneis already ‘inside’ me. Proust’s taste of the cake dipped in herb tea was arevelation of the size of this inner library. And Proust, for all his irritatingqualities, deserves credit for being the first great novelist to make thisexperience the centre of his life’s work. He raises the most interesting of allquestions: what is the meaning of that overwhelming certainty that ‘all iswell’? For Proust, the paradox was that it was a feeling of strength andconfidence; and, since Proust was a hypochondriac, this contradicted the imageof himself that he took completely for granted. Nietzsche experienced a similarrevelation during a thunderstorm on a hilltop; as the thunder crashed and therain hammered on the roof of the hut in which he had taken shelter, he felt animmense exhilaration, and wrote: ‘Pure will, without the troubles andperplexities of intellect—how happy, how free!’ Yet Nietzsche, like Proust,suffered from poor health, and the revelation seemed to be a contradiction of aself-evident ‘truth’ about himself. The revelation always has this effect ofparadox, of flat contradiction of our normal values. Gorki tells how Tolstoy waswalking down the street when two guardsmen came walking towards him. As theystrode along with jingling spurs Tolstoy said indignantly: ‘What pompousstupidity, like circus animals...’ Then, as the soldiers came abreast, marchingin step, ‘But aren’t they magnificent!’ Sheer vital energy overwhelmed hisintellectual judgement; the right brain contradicted the left.All of which makes it clear that the certainty that ‘all is well’ is arecognition of this ‘other self’, with its immense, crude vitality. Man hasslowly developed a left-brain personality, capable of dealing with the intricateminutiae of existence—unlike animals and young children, who are quite incapableof handling complications. As the complexity of civilization has increased, andsurvival of the fittest has ensured the development of left-brain efficiency,the left brain has come to seem the ‘dominant hemisphere’ and the rightcorrespondingly the ‘minor hemisphere’. The right has slipped into the positionof an overworked housewife, a downtrodden drudge.For most of the time, this hardly matters, for the right carries on with itsessential task of supplying ‘reality’ with a third dimension, a dimension ofmeaning. When we are thoroughly relaxed—perhaps on holiday—the right is treatedas an equal partner, and we are suddenly surprised to notice that reality can beso pleasant and rich. But the moment we are placed under stress, the leftdispenses with this dimension of meaning, and contents itself with a symbolicrepresentation of the world; these moving creatures who jostle me are merely‘people’; those noisy objects that roar past me are merely ‘traffic’. In effect,the left is holding its breath, like a swimmer under water, making do withoutmeaning. But if it does this for too long, it begins to feel tired anddepressed. And at this point, as we have seen, this deadly ‘negative feedback’mechanism slips into gear, and the result can be depression, panic attacks,nervous collapse, even insanity. (‘Meaning starvation’—for example, sensorydeprivation in a black room—can produce hallucinations, as the right brain triesto replace the missing dimension.)Human beings have developed various ways of attempting to escape this negativefeedback circuit. The simplest is to allow our instincts to take over: eating,drinking, hunting, making love, making war, seeking adventure. All theseactivities can rescue us from left-brain impoverishment. But the left brain hasits own remedies, ways of reminding itself that the impoverished,two-dimensional reality is not the whole truth. The most powerful and effectiveof these methods is religion, which requires the recognition, as an article offaith, that there is another dimension of reality beyond this world which isvisible to our senses. So when the savage has completed his ritual sacrifice tohis gods, or when a man rises from his knees after the Sacrament, he experiencesa sense of comfort, of release from anxiety, of contact with meaning andpurpose.Later still, man developed art as a method of ‘reminding’ himself of that otherdimension. It originated as a servant of religion, but eventually assumed itsown identity. Art is, in fact, a collaboration between the right and lefthemispheres; the right provides the insights, the left translates them intowords or shapes or musical notes. Keats pointed out that the essence of art—hewas speaking of poetry but it applies to all art—is ‘negative capability’,openness, receptivity, when the left brain is prepared to remain silent and waitfor the right to speak. Since art is a collaboration between left and right, itcan hardly avoid serving as a reminder of the existence of the right.Science came later than religion or art, and in the past century, has gaineditself a bad reputation among the religious and the artistically inclined. Butthis is because scientists have taken it upon themselves to dogmatize aboutreality, unaware that the reality they perceive through their microscopes is thetwo-dimensional reality of the left brain. Science is nothing more than areference system, like the index at the end of a book, which is meaninglesswithout the reality that occupies the rest of the book. And now this slow,plodding method of ‘indexing’ reality is beginning to reveal its true value. Forthe left brain is never entirely convinced by the ‘revelations’ of religion andart; it is inclined to discount them as mere ‘emotions’. But today its owninvestigations of the structure of the brain have made it aware that reality isunreal until it is completed by a third dimension.And so we have been enabled to grasp through the intellect the truth we alreadyknew by instinct: that if the left brain is to grasp the reality of the world,it must slow down until it is walking at the same pace as the right. For thefirst time, we are able to grasp objectively what happened when the romanticsexperienced their ‘moments of vision’, and why they found them sodishearteningly elusive. We can also see the baffling nature of the problemfaced by the romantics. They were, in effect, trying to re-live the wholehistory of mankind. Animals are instinctive, right-brain creatures, who have nocapacity for self-detachment. But at least they remain in constant contact withthe three-dimensional world of reality. When human beings leave their childhoodbehind, they have to learn to cope with a world of symbols; and so they losehold of their sense of reality. The romantics discovered how to use art torestore the contact; but in doing so, they were inclined to drift back into theworld of the child. Thomas Mann describes in Buddenbrooks how young HannoBuddenbrook loves his holidays at the seaside; yet his family can neverunderstand why these holidays seem to leave him weaker, not stronger. It isbecause a return to right-brain reality creates a revulsion from the left. Theromantics thought that this was inevitable: that the man who is capable ofexperiencing this deeper reality (and it is deeper in the quite literal sense ofpossessing a third dimension) will inevitably be a ‘loser’. It became part ofthe romantic myth that man can choose either crude vitality and success, orsensitivity and failure. From Blake to D.H. Lawrence, the romantics were unitedin denouncing the left brain and all its works.We can see that the conflict was quite unnecessary. It is not a choice betweengoing forward into the world of the scientist or backward into the world of thechild. Left-brain consciousness must remain as dominant and powerful as ever,prepared to take over at a moment’s notice. Yet it must also be capable ofremaining silent; of suspending its dominance to allow the right to develop itsown powers of self-expression.Now we can see the implications of Brad’s experiences. One of the main problemsof western man is that his left brain is hyperactive. Like some enormousfactory, it hums and roars with deafening activity. Yet much of this activity isautomatic; machines have been left running when they could equally well beswitched off.When we are subjected to unexpected stress or sudden crisis, the factory noiserises to a hysterical crescendo. Disappearance of the stress brings a startlingsilence, as we become aware that the anxiety is unnecessary—and that the normallevel of tension is far in excess of our need for alertness. We realize we couldafford to relax and treat life as a holiday. This mechanism explains Greene’s‘vision’ after playing Russian roulette.There is another method of silencing the machinery—to remain relaxed but alertfor fairly long periods of time—which is the basis of the technique ofenlightenment discovered by the Buddha. He dismissed the strenuous self-tormentof Hindu ascetics and yogis, and insisted that it was enough to sit quietly,holding the mind calm and steady. ‘This trembling, wavering mind, so difficultto guard and to control, this the wise man makes straight as the fletcherstraightens his shaft.’ ‘Will is the way to Nirvana; laziness is the way ofdeath. The wise man guards his vigour as his greatest possession.’ But one ofthe chief difficulties encountered by those who try to meditate—to silence themind—is our tendency to drift into ‘free association’. As Brad lay beside hiswife, there was no tendency to free association; he was listening intently forthe first signs that she was returning to normal. He was, in effect, asking hismind to be quiet. He was like a man listening intently for a distant sound.After a while, his mind obeyed; and then ‘listening’ became a habit. And at thatpoint, Brad had achieved his own version of enlightenment. From now on, theother self could make itself heard.Brad’s method, like the Buddha’s, is fundamentally simple and easy to use. Assoon as we relax and close our eyes, we become conscious of the roar of themachinery, the tension of the body, the forward-drive of the will. It is theopposite of what you experience when you awaken from a deep sleep, thoroughlyrelaxed. But the aim is not now to relax. It is to bring the automatic activityof the mind under control, to silence the machinery.Since we are full of automatic tensions, the direct approach—simply to‘unwind’—is seldom successful. It is better to begin by deliberately increasingthe tension. Concentrate the mind, as if lifting an enormously heavy weight, andallow the attention to move from part to part of the body, enlisting thecooperation of each part in the collective effort. Clench and unclench thefists; tense and relax the muscles of the arms, the stomach, the thighs. Afterhalf a minute or so, relax. Then do it again.My own experience is that after ten minutes or so there is a sense of a tidalflow of energy around the body. Mesmer believed that the universe is full ofvital currents, and that human beings can tune in to these currents. Certainly,the sensation produced by this constant effort of ‘vigilance’ is of waves ofenergy running through the body like an in-coming tide.This effort also makes one aware that we are normally full of unused energy. IfI am forced to keep breaking off my writing to check facts in reference books, Ibecome aware of an increasing exasperation; it is rather like holding my breath.These ‘trapped’ energies can produce migraine or depression. The exercise of‘controlled tension’ makes one aware of these energies, as they are slowlydischarged. A point comes at which so much ‘trapped’ energy has been dischargedthat we can afford to relax. And now, like a tired athlete, we can acceptrelaxation with gratitude, and without the protesting voice of unused energies.This is an interesting state. For once the protesting voices have been silenced,there is nothing to prevent us from opening the door and walking into the worldinside us.This can be a stage of delightful exploration. In a story called ‘The Man of theCrowd’, Edgar Allan Poe describes how, recovering from an illness, he sat in thewindow of a coffee house in London. ‘With returning strength, I found myself inone of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of ennui—moods ofthe keenest appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs...’ In thiscase, illness had switched off the ‘machinery’, and returning health had not yetswitched it on. Poe describes his immense interest as he studied the passingcrowds. But in the same state, we can study the passing crowds inside the mind.It is my own experience that in these states, mental pictures are exceptionallyclear. The sensation is not unlike getting a good picture on a television screenon which we have become accustomed to poor reception. And suddenly, it becomesobvious that this world has been there all the time, waiting for us to enter. Itis like some cave in the Arabian Nights, entered by raising a massive stoneslab. And below the slab there is a flight of stone steps, leading down to anunderground palace.It is important to grasp that we are not now speaking of a world of dreams orfancies. Sir Karl Popper made this point when he coined the term ‘World 3’.World 1 is the physical world outside us; World 2 is the subjective world ofwhich we become aware when we close our eyes. But then, there is the world thatman has created or discovered, and which he stores in libraries. If ourcivilization was destroyed tomorrow, but all the books were still left intact,it would be possible for our descendants to rebuild the world within a fewgenerations. But if all the books and records were also destroyed, man wouldhave to start from scratch, and it might take two thousand years or so. World 3,the world of what we have discovered, is an independent entity, like World 1 and2. It has objective existence, like the physical world.Those who have succeeded in gaining ‘access to inner worlds’ have discoveredwith surprise that they are quite unlike dreams or hallucinations. In Heaven andHell, Aldous Huxley made this point in a now-famous remark: ‘Like the earth of ahundred years ago, our mind still has its darkest Africas, its unmapped Borneosand Amazonian basins.’ And he adds: ‘Like the giraffe and the duck-billedplatypus, the creatures inhabiting these remoter regions of the mind areexceedingly improbable. Nevertheless they exist...’ He goes on to point out thatsome people can be transported to these regions under hypnosis. Huxley commentsthat we are still ignorant of how hypnosis produces its effects. Since he wrotethese words, in 1956, we have a fairly shrewd idea of how it produces itseffects: by putting the left brain to sleep, and leaving the right wide awake.And, as we know, either putting the left brain to sleep, or silencing the noiseof its machinery, can open the doors to the world inside us.Huxley’s simile about our mental Borneos and Amazonian basins may be toopicturesque. The first thing we discover when the left brain can be persuaded tolet go of our coat tails is that we are in a large and rather interestinglibrary. Yet it differs from an ordinary library in one basic respect. Inlibraries, the books sit on the shelves, with their backs to you, and you haveno way of finding out about their contents except by removing them and lookinginside. But this mental library is rather more like a sound library where therecords are being played continuously. If you place your ear close to the coversof any book, you can hear the memories it contains. Perhaps you catch the soundof a musicbox that belonged to your elder sister when you were a baby, or thelong-forgotten barking of the hysterical pekinese they used to have next door,or the warm, tarry smell of the garden fence in the sunlight, together with avivid memory of the way the paint blistered on the back door, or the reflectionsof light on the boating pond in the park, or the taste of over-roasted chestnutsthat burnt the tongue...Even the briefest glimpse of these memories produces asense of pure delight and astonishment, that feeling of ‘immortality’ thatProust described. And why do we feel astonished? To begin with, because thesheer profusion, the sheer quantity, of these memories seems unnecessary. Whyhas the brain carefully stored up everything that has ever happened to us sincebirth, if we are never going to make use of it, and if the brain is going tostart decomposing within minutes of death? Somehow, this seems unlikely. Theremust be some other purpose behind human existence, some immense, complex,unfathomable purpose...This is not a reasoned conclusion; it is a feeling, akind of perception, and it explains why Proust ceased to feel mediocre,accidental, mortal, and why Camus’s Meursault could suddenly realize that he hadbeen happy and was happy still. It explains why Scrooge burst into tears andceased to be a miser when he had been allowed a brief glimpse of that libraryinside the head.But this library inside us is not merely a repository of separate memories. Whatis so exciting is that these memories can blend together and connect intosomething much bigger. The tarry smell of the sun-warmed fence is connected withthe smell of grass, and an odd cold sensation that seems to be a memory ofwater, which in turn brings back the cold of a winter day and the sogginess ofmelting snow...And at this point, it becomes difficult to pinpoint thesensations because they seem to be spreading outwards, so that every one evokeshalf a dozen others, and so on in geometric progression. There is a dazzlingsensation of hovering above your own life, seeing it as a whole, like someenormous landscape. And as we glimpse these ‘distant horizons’, we also becomeaware that this is what memory is for. Not fragmentary, piecemeal perceptions,but a total grasp. And not only of my own life, but, by some process ofdeduction, of other lives, of all life.Our ‘normal’ way of perceiving the world could be compared to a man who is soshort-sighted that, whenever he goes to a picture gallery, he has to peer at thepaintings through a magnifying glass. Naturally, he can never see more than afew square inches. If he is very intelligent and very diligent, he can puttogether a general idea of the whole picture. But if he tries to stand back andsee it as a whole, it turns into a blur. If someone presented him with a pair ofpowerful spectacles that would enable him to look at pictures from the properdistance, the result would be a revelation—very much like Plato’s image of theman who is allowed outside the cave.The absurd thing is that, in the case of this inner picture gallery, we knowthere is nothing wrong with our eyesight. We were intended to have theseglimpses of things as a whole. Then what is it that prevents us? The answerseems to be our lack of desire, our failing to recognize that this is one of ourperfectly normal possibilities. We take it for granted that living means‘coping’ with the external world, and that the moments of relaxation, when weretreat inside ourselves, are no more than ‘breathing spaces’, holidays from theeveryday business of living. All children know better, of course. When theybecome absorbed in a fairy tale, with its magical landscapes, they knowperfectly well that life was intended to be more than this dreary business of‘living’. They know precisely what William Blake meant when he wrote:> Father, O father, what do we here> > In this land of unbelief and fear?> > The Land of Dreams is better far,> > Above the light of the morning star.They feel increasingly that this world is a kind of prison. Yet there genuinelyseems to be no alternative. Their fathers have to go out to work to supportthem, and they, in due course, will have to learn to force this difficult worldto grant them subsistence. So they also learn to ‘cope’, and to take briefholidays in the ‘land of dreams’.This certainly seems to be inevitable. Man has become the most dominant creatureon earth because he has learned to ‘cope’ better than any other animal. Andanimals certainly have very little capacity for ‘access to inner worlds’. When astranger comes into your house, your dog either recognizes him or he doesn’t.The dog has no capacity to search his memory or ask, ‘Now where have I seen himbefore?’ It seems reasonable to suppose that man’s memory, that rudimentaryaccess to inner worlds, is simply one more evolutionary development to enablehim to ‘cope’.Those deeper glimpses of ‘inner worlds’ reveal that this is not so. If wepossess such a vast inner library, were we not intended to make more use of itthan we do? We were intended to have a deeper, more vivid type of consciousness.But how are we to achieve it? Brad’s experience leaves no possible doubt aboutthe answer. We have to know the library is there, and start using it. We have tolearn deep relaxation, learn to still the left brain and the senses. TheAladdin’s cave is there, waiting for us to walk in. The only thing that stops usfrom doing so is ignorance of its existence.And yet we cannot claim to be really ignorant. When, for example, I readRaskolnikov’s statement that he would rather stand on a narrow ledge for everand ever than die at once, I know perfectly well what he means, and I know Iwould feel the same. When I hear about some tramp who says that all he wants outof life is a country cottage with roses round the door and a small income, Iunderstand exactly why he believes that this would keep him happy for the restof his days. In fact, Raskolnikov would probably commit suicide after a fewweeks on a narrow ledge; the tramp would probably become bored and dissatisfiedafter a winter in his ideal cottage. But a simple act of identification makes usaware of why they thought otherwise. The life of a hunted criminal is one ofcontinual uncertainty; so is the life of a homeless tramp. They make continuousdemands on the ability to ‘cope’. And it is so easy to see how, when we have thechance to relax and appreciate life, we merely have to sigh with relief and slowdown. If you asked Raskolnikov what he would do on his ledge, he would reply:‘Be grateful that I am still alive.’ If you asked the tramp what he would do inhis garden, he would reply: ‘Just look around.’ For each of them, the answerlies in simply calming the senses, slowing down the left brain until it walks atthe same pace as the right.This is only the first step. There is obviously far more to it than that.Consider more closely what happens when we ‘slow down’. Let us suppose that Ifeel tired after a hard day’s work. I pour myself a glass of wine, drop into myarmchair, and heave a sigh of relief. In effect, I tell myself: now you canrelax. It is a kind of hypnotic command. Then I pick up a novel. I read only oneparagraph—a description of an autumn day—yet as I read, I seem to smell thatdistinctive smell of damp earth and rotting leaves. What has happened is that,because my left brain has slowed down, my right can perform its proper functionof supplying a third dimension to experience. The experience is, in this case,purely fictional; yet the right hemisphere dutifully supplies those smells andsounds and colours. It can do so because I am in no hurry. I am prepared tolisten without impatience.If I push the book aside and stare out of the window, the right brain is just aswilling to do its own specialized job. I get a feeling of dozens of possiblesensations hovering on the edge of consciousness, like willing servants, readyto obey my instructions. If I choose to think about last year’s holidays, I canclose my eyes, and momentarily travel back to that rented cottage with its noisyplumbing and that dangerous back doorstep. But my right brain is just as willingto give me a glimpse of my schooldays, or the science lab at the technicalcollege, complete with that acrid smell of nitrogen peroxide. If I choose toopen a volume of poems, it will supply a ‘third dimension’ for a poem of RobertService just as willingly as for W.H. Auden; the right brain is no culturalsnob. And if I want to put on a record of a Haydn symphony, it will happilysupply a whole kaleidoscope of images and impressions.All these sensations clearly belong to the faculty called imagination. But wenormally think of imagination as the ability to conjure up mental images: I canimagine what it would be like to win the football pools, or to go hang-gliding.In fact, imagination is far more than this. It is the ability to re-createexperience, in all its complexity and richness. And the right brain is able todo precisely that.The problem is that it seldom gets a chance. I read a book about ancient Rome,and imagine that I now have an excellent grasp of the world of the Romans. Myright brain shakes its head in despair; if only I had allowed it to cooperate,it could have re-created ancient Rome for me. How? By drawing upon its immensestore of memories and impressions. I have galloped through the book at such aspeed that it is little more than a series of blurred impressions. But it is notsimply a question of speed—the right can move with surprising speed when itwants to. It is a kind of forgetfulness. We forget that when we relax, the rightbrain will supply reality with a third dimension.And now it becomes possible to understand the direction of human evolution. The‘reality’ experienced by animals is no doubt far richer and more complex thanour human reality, because they experience it with the whole brain, not justwith a half. And their experiences are also stored away in the brain-library.But their access to this library is then limited. They lack reflectiveself-consciousness. It is doubtful whether a dog can lie on the mat and recallimages of its past. It lacks any kind of detachment from itself.The first step in human evolution was to achieve ‘detachment’. Slowly, and nodoubt very painfully, man learned to use his powers of reason. It must have beenan uphill task, as hard as a child learning to cope with the adult world. But itwas necessary to survival. Our ancestors had to learn how to ambush the mammothand the great elk, and how to outwit the natural cunning of predators who wantedto make a meal of their children. Their success led to the creation ofsurprisingly complex societies, with shamans who taught them how to achievesuccess in the hunt by means of magic. The shamans eventually became priests,and cities sprang up around temples. Man had to learn to cope with a complex and‘unnatural’ social life. Cities were intended to protect their inhabitants; butthe archaeology of Mesopotamia teaches us that almost as soon as the firstcities appeared—around 6000 BC—the first wars began. The city dwellers weresquabbling about territory. No matter how hard he tried, it seemed that mancould not escape stress and uncertainty. So he used his ingenuity to createcities with massive walls and underground water supplies, to withstand siege. Healso created war chariots and siege engines to destroy other people’s cities.The result was that by the year3000 BC, the history of mankind had turned intoan almost continuous tale of slaughter. Three thousand years before the Nazis,the Assyrians practised torture and genocide, and boasted about them in theirinscriptions and bas-reliefs. The fictional brutality of the James Bond novelshocks us; but if we imagine something of the sort happening continuously forcentury after century, we can begin to understand why man grew like a hot-houseplant. To the student of early history, it seems incredible that Plato waswriting the Republic only five thousand years after the foundation of the firstcities. And that ten thousand years before that, our ancestors lived in caves.But it was almost certainly because human life was so bloody and violent thatman developed the powers of his left brain, the ability to think, to calculate,to look ahead.And now he possessed these powers, a new phase began. Spartans and Persians andMacedonians continued to slaughter one another and burn cities. But nowso-called ‘learned men’ were studying the heavens and the forces of nature, andcommitting their observations to scrolls and sheepskins. Man began to build anew world, the world of knowledge—Popper’s ‘World 3’. And some remarkable menmade a very creditable attempt to transfer the whole sum of human knowledge intotheir own small brains—their left brains. Nowadays, names like Paracelsus andFicino and Pico della Mirandola and Cardano mean very little to us; in their owntime, they were regarded as intellectual supermen. By the nineteenth century,such men were no longer a rarity; universities produced them by the dozen. Menlike Kant, Hegel, Carlyle, Ruskin, Soloviev, Tolstoy, lived in World 3 asnaturally as a fish lives in water, and so did thousands of ‘intellectuals’ wehave never even heard of.Yet such men were not necessarily happy in their self-chosen element; Ruskineven went insane. They despised mere physical existence; they wanted life raisedto a higher level by the power of the mind. Yet most of them were thoroughlydissatisfied with their cold world of intellect. The romantics expressed thisdissatisfaction most clearly: the longing for something warmer, richer, morereal, than this attenuated realm of philosophy and art.And we, at last, are in a position to understand precisely what they wanted.With their heads stuffed with all kinds of knowledge, they wanted to make itlive, as Combray suddenly ‘lived’ for Proust as he tasted the madeleine. That iswhy human beings have such a passion for knowledge: because it somehow freesthem from the personal, allows them to enter a wider world where there is asense of freedom, like standing on a mountain top. This in turn makes us awareof the extraordinary and paradoxical fact that human beings were not primarilyintended to live in ‘this world’. This sounds absurd; for when we look at a dogor a bird, we can see plainly that its ‘purpose’ is to keep itself alive—tosurvive—and to propagate its kind. That is its primary purpose and, as far as wecan see, its only obvious purpose. Man is an animal: ergo, the same thing shouldapply to him. Yet human beings who are restricted to such an existence feelthere is something wrong. They begin to crave some ‘other’ form of existence;this is the origin of religion. And when we read of a Newton discovering the lawof gravity, a Harvey discovering the circulation of the blood, a Kantdiscovering that the mind influences our perceptions, a Freud discovering thatman’s unconscious mind is far more powerful than his conscious mind, we see in aflash that man was intended for more than mere survival. He was not intended for‘personal’ existence; he was intended for impersonal existence. This soundsbleak and uncomfortable, but that is only because we are confusing theimpersonal with our left-brain, two-dimensional consciousness. When the rightbrain adds its third dimension, the realm of the impersonal becomes far morerich and exciting than the personal. Ants labour impersonally at theirant-hills; wasps labour impersonally at their nests: these are their homes. Manlabours impersonally at this gigantic edifice that is World 3: that is his home.And now we come to the most absurd, the most preposterous part of the story.What would we think of a man who lived out on the lawn in a tent, while he builthimself a magnificent home, and then absent-mindedly went on living in the tentand left the house empty? For that is precisely what man has done. We have onlyto glance at the enormous volumes of history, philosophy, theology,anthropology, sociology, on library shelves, to see that very few of the writersactually lived their knowledge. Arnold Toynbee admits as much in the last volumeof A Study of History, where he describes certain brief moments in which heexperienced history as a living reality. Those few moments of ‘living history’were enough to provide the stimulus for half a century’s labour. Similarly,Proust’s few ‘glimpses’ led to the writing of his immense novel, and the writingitself was an attempt to fathom the mystery of those glimpses, with theirtantalizing implication that it could all be ‘so easy’. Proust created amasterpiece, yet he failed to solve the mystery.But why does man live in a tent? Why does he treat the mansion as a museum whichis open for only a few minutes a week? The answer probably lies in the past fewthousand years, with its high level of violence. Man developed his intelligenceto avoid extinction, and in the past few millennia, that threat has actuallyincreased—its source being his own kind. So intelligence has developed inassociation with the need for alertness, for scanning the external world forproblems and threats. In short, intelligence sprang from a sense of urgency. Andnow the urgency has diminished, and man can afford to relax and enjoy thismagnificent civilization he has created, he finds it impossible to escape theold sense of urgency. Like a man who has been driving all day, and who keepswaking up at night, imagining he is still behind the wheel, mankind has slippedinto an insidious habit—of anxiety, of tension, of over-alertness.But intelligence is the ability to adjust to new circumstances. And compared tosome of the problems he has solved in the past—problems of survival that makeour own lives seem like a non-stop holiday—this problem of left-brainover-alertness is relatively trivial. It has remained so persistent largelybecause we have made no real attempt to solve it. When things are going well, wetend to switch on the ‘automatic pilot’, and do what we did yesterday and theday before. This is another legacy of the past: that we need crisis to keepalert. But when we consider this matter more closely, we realize that we alreadyknow the answer.Let us first of all restate the problem. It is our inability to ‘retreat insideourselves’, to make use of our freedom. We can be free and yet bored. And whenwe are bored, we feel trapped in this material world, ‘as if that were all thereis’. When we are faced with difficult problems, we know that to be withoutproblems would in itself be delightful. But after being without problems for aday or two, we feel ‘at a loose end’. It is infuriating to feel that you are avictim of your own moods, and that you lack the ability to carry out long-termdecisions. This is why ascetics flagellated themselves and slept in hair shirts;they felt instinctively that the answer lay in self-discipline. Yet we feelinstinctively that this is not the answer either; this is trying to open thedoor with a battering ram when it ought to open of its own accord.The problem is ‘generalized hypertension’; our minds refuse to stop running. Yetwe possess a natural ‘brake’. If someone raises his finger and says: ‘Listen!’,we automatically apply this brake and slow down our senses (another way ofsaying: sharpen our perceptions).Again, consider what happens when you finally get hold of a book you have beenwanting to read for a long time. You make sure that you will not be disturbed,and then ‘switch off’ your interest in the external world—so that if someonespeaks to you, you don’t even hear them. It is exactly as if you had taken alarge funnel, inserted it into the book, and then poured all your attention intoit.Sex can have this same ‘funnelling effect’, concentrating the senses andfocusing the vital energies, giving us again a glimpse of that Proustian senseof power and control. This is why sex means so much more to human beings than toany other animal. Equally revealing, from our point of view, is the popularityof pornography. After all, we enjoy eating, but few of us bother to read booksabout it. But the actuality of sex is often a disappointment. Why? Because iteasily becomes diluted by habit—the robot. Our senses drift back into their oldhabit of ‘scanning the external world’. And the quantity of attention that goesdown the funnel diminishes steadily. A book enables us to by-pass the robot; wedeliberately focus full attention on the description of sex, and again achievethe ‘funnelling effect’.And here we can see how far human beings have evolved beyond all other animals.For a chimpanzee, a book or a photograph or a blue film would be as abstract asan algebraic formula. Our right brain obligingly adds a third dimension ofreality, so that we are sexually stimulated by an abstraction. We can evenimagine a sexual stimulus and experience the same response.All of which demonstrates that we already know the answer. It lies in thedeliberate use of ‘the funnel’.Let us look more closely at the mechanics of this process of ‘funnelling’. I amrelaxed in an armchair. I idly pick up a child’s schoolbook that lies on thefloor—an anthology of poetry. In a spirit of nostalgia I turn the pages: ‘Elegywritten in a Country Churchyard’, ‘The Daffodils’, ‘Ode to the West Wind’, ‘Fullfathom five’... As I read Gray’s‘Elegy’, I conjure up a picture of achurch-bell, a herd of cows, a tired ploughman. But because I am relaxed, I addother things that Gray forgot to include: the plop of cow dung on the muddy roadand its not-unpleasant grassy smell, the moss on the gravestones, the cool smellof the air after a shower. Phrases like ‘glimmering landscape’, ‘drowsytinklings’, ‘ivy-mantled tower’, ‘blazing hearth’, all bring a trickle ofdelight, and encourage my ‘other self’ to supply more details. When he speaks ofswallows twittering in a straw-built shed, my mind supplies the smell of thestraw. And when I have finished the poem, I experience a deep inner calm, asense of relaxation, of relief. It doesn’t matter that much of the poem seemsold-fashioned, and that it has more than a touch of sermonizing. Gray hasdemonstrated to me what my mind can do. It can take me out of this armchair, toother times and other places. When I turn to Shelley’s ‘Ode to the West Wind’,my mind creates the roaring of wind in trees and the smell of autumn leaves;when Wordsworth speaks of ‘old unhappy far-off things’, my mind slips intohistory, and I realize that even if my own life is limited to three score andten, I am the only animal who can look back down the corridors of history justas I can look down on the world from an aeroplane.There can be no doubt whatever: I have re-created Gray’s country churchyard andWordsworth’s daffodils and Shelley’s autumn woods. This ‘I’ is Howard Miller’s‘unit of pure thought’. And it is capable of far more than conjuring up a fewmental images: a beach in summer, a mountain landscape. It is perfectly willingto take me on mental voyages. When my child comes and switches on the televisionset, I realize that these trivial soap operas and situation comedies are basedon the false assumption, that our imagination is limited. Having just returnedfrom this mental voyage, I only feel saddened by these crude attempts to engagemy attention.Yet this is hardly the fault of the television companies. For how often do I tryto use that power of the mind? When I feel tired, I pick up a newspaper, or lookin the TV guide. My leisure is controlled by this assumption that that world‘out there’ is the reality, and that if I close my eyes, I shall fall asleep.But let me try to grasp the implications of what has just happened. The old lampin the woodshed is an Aladdin’s lamp, which can release a genie who is willingto take me voyages on a magic carpet. The absurd thing is that I have knownabout him since childhood; he has been taking me on these voyages ever since mymother read me Jack and the Beanstalk. But I have made the false assumption thatthese voyages were a kind of dream. They also seemed to depend upon some factorthat I could not control: so that even with a free evening and a good book, Icould still not be sure whether the magic carpet would float off the ground, orleave me sitting there. More often than not, it left me sitting there. So I havecome to feel that the carpet is thoroughly unreliable. Now can see that thefault lay in me. I have simply failed to achieve the correct conditions: torelax, to still the senses, to ‘funnel’ my mental energies into the book.Sometimes, there seems to be some obscure dissatisfaction in me that resists thewhole process, a kind of tension. If I analyse this more closely, I see that itsprings from another misunderstanding. I am inclined to assume that my own roleis passive; I sit down with the book, and wait for it to ‘transport’ me. But ifI study the experience of being deeply moved by poetry, I see that I have to dohalf the work. I request my right brain to conjure up the country churchyard. Isay, ‘How about some cow dung?’, ‘ How about the smell of straw?’, ‘How aboutsome moonlight reflected on a pond ?’, and my right brain obliges. They haveentered into a state of mutual understanding, of collaboration. It is a processof dialogue. So again, the lesson is: I must establish communication with mygenie. It is not his fault if he is ignored and forgotten.In short, the lesson of the experience is the recognition: ‘Now I have apartner.’ It is analogous to falling in love and realizing that your feelingsare reciprocated. ‘I’ am not alone. What I now have to do is to recognize theimplications of this discovery. To some extent, I have always known them. Forexample, if I need to wake up at seven in the morning, some inner alarm clockwill awaken me at precisely seven. This depends, to some extent, onself-confidence. If I am feeling tense and nervous, I shall probably wake uphalf a dozen times in the night, and then oversleep. But this is because Ibelieve I am alone. If I am feeling healthy and cheerful, my confidence somehowactivates that ‘other self’, which gives me a good night’s sleep and awakens meat the right time. I must come to take the existence of this ‘other self’ forgranted, as a basic, unforgettable fact, I must use it and learn to communicatewith it. Once I can accept its existence as an incontrovertible fact, then I canbegin to persuade it to cooperate on projects that would once have seemedimpossible.To begin with, it is the answer to the problem Maslow thought insoluble: how tosummon ‘peak experiences’ at will. The technique is for the ‘me’, the left-brainself, to build up optimism and self-confidence, the certainty that ‘all iswell’. (And this is the easiest thing in the world; I just did it spontaneouslyas I wrote the previous sentence.) We can study this simplest of all mechanismsin all moments of contentment—by recalling, for example, what it was like as achild on Christmas Day: that increasing feeling of ‘trust’, of happy expectancy.When the left brain tells itself, ‘All is well,’ the right responds with a glowof warmth, a trickle of sheer joy. I am, in effect, re-programming mysubconscious, my ‘underfloor lightning’.It is true that if I have been feeling depressed, I may find it difficult toconvince myself that ‘all is well’; some diminutive sceptic inside me mutters,‘Oh yeah?’ Here it is important to grasp Howard Miller’s central recognition:that the ‘I’ is the master of consciousness. The presence of the inner scepticis unimportant; he will eventually be overruled by majority opinion. Meanwhile,the ‘I’ must state: ‘It is an objective fact that all is well.’ For this is thevery heart of the matter. We are speaking of objectivity. Most human unhappinessis due to subjectivity, our tendency to be dominated by emotions we know to be‘false’, yet which seem to cling with the persistency of leeches. We evolve byforcing these emotions to obey the rule of law, of objectivity.As soon as we induce these states of inner certainty, we begin to observe theireffect. We become less ‘accident-prone’. Some sixth sense helps to steer usclear of trouble. Interesting coincidences begin to occur. (When I becomesubject to these synchronicities, I know I am in good health.) We may begin tohave flashes of pre-cognition; the telephone rings and you know who it is beforeyou answer it. You know that a letter from a long-lost friend will arrive in thepost. In short, the right brain seems to control certain paranormal powers, andis willing to place them at the disposal of the left. The kahunas assert thatthe ‘higher self’ can control the future; and everyone who has experienced moodsof relaxed self-confidence knows that curious inner certainty that nothing isgoing to go wrong.The most interesting possibility remains the prospect of unlimited ‘access toinner worlds’. The ‘natural’ view of our inner world is that it consists offeelings, memories, emotions, and that these are necessarily limited. TheProustian ‘glimpses’ make us aware that this is untrue. The ‘library’ containsdetailed recordings of everything that has ever happened to us, and these can berecombined in any order. Just as a simple knowledge of algebra provides me withthe basis for solving any algebraic problem, so a fairly small range ofexperience can provide us with the material for constructing a vast range of‘other realities’. We catch a glimpse of this inventiveness in dreams, or in‘hypnagogic states’ (between sleeping and waking); but these are obviously somekind of random selection. Our inner librarian does his best work when we ask forhis cooperation. When, for example, I am reading a book about Paris in thenineteenth century, he helpfully conjures up a vast range of images, fromBalzac, Zola, Maupassant to the Impressionist painters to my own memory of thesights and smells of the Left Bank. He only does this when I am thoroughlyrelaxed and absorbed; but when he chooses to do it, he evokes a Paris which isactually far richer than any physical experience of the real place.This ability to ‘realize’ another time and place I call Faculty X. It is quiteclearly a natural ability we all possess, but that we fail to understand. Theglimpses of the romantics were glimpses of Faculty X; and, as we have seen, theyconcluded that they come and go as they please. Only now, more than a centurylater, are we beginning to recognize that such states are within our control;not only that, but that they offer the promise of the most fascinating step inhuman evolution so far. When we study the long course of evolution, from thecrude instinctive consciousness of the animal to our own sophisticated andcomplex self-awareness, it suddenly becomes clear that the main direction ofthis evolution has been the conscious control of Faculty X.In Back to Methuselah, Shaw suggested that human beings would have to learn tolive for at least three centuries in order to begin to realize theirpossibilities; seventy or eighty years is simply not enough. As to how thiswould come about, Shaw explained that once human beings had become conscious ofthe necessity, the rest would follow automatically. The unconscious mind woulddo the rest. ‘The brain shall not fail when the will is in earnest.’ At thetime, this struck many of Shaw’s admirers as the least plausible part of histheory—human beings are used to struggling for what they want. But we can seethat it is a plain statement of fact about Faculty X. The crucial step inindividual evolution is quite simply to recognize the existence of that ‘otherself’. When this happens, we are ready to embark upon the most interestingexperiment of all: to discover what our two selves can do when they enter intoactive collaboration.For myself, I must acknowledge that Brad’s description of his experiencesbrought new levels of insight into this whole problem of ‘visionaryconsciousness’ and the two selves. The pressures of writing a quarter of amillion words in four months had made me aware that I had to stop treating thisas a problem for ‘me alone’. I had to assume that something inside me wouldrespond to the urgency and take on half the work. And as I slaved away, I becameaware of a sensation that something was happening: rather as if someone hadtaken hold of the other end of the double-handed saw. There was no possibilityof relaxation: I still had to do my part. But there was a comforting sense ofhaving a willing helper. I have always been too inclined to drive myself, tooinclined to grit my teeth and rely on sheer force and stubbornness. And I have adeep distrust of anything that looks like self-pity or self-indulgence, forthese have been far more responsible than material hardship for the destructionof many ‘Outsiders’. But under pressure, this attitude of mind can lead tofatalism and pessimism. As I wrote chapter after chapter of the Rasputin novel,then of Poltergeist, the pessimism began to give way to a cautious, realisticoptimism.At Viittakivi, I tried to convey to my students what I felt to be the centrallesson of the previous six months: that we must be in charge of our ownemotions. The logical answer to someone who says, ‘I am depressed’, is, ‘Ok.Un-depress yourself.’ To demonstrate the point, I asked the students to meditateupon the most depressing thoughts they could call to mind. Within a few minutes,most of them were looking thoroughly gloomy. Then they were told: ‘Now snap outof it.’ ‘Under orders’, they found this fairly easy to do—easier than it mighthave been if they were alone. On the last day, all the groups met together inthe main hall, and various spokesmen tried to explain what they had been doing.The woman who spoke for our group said: ‘Mr Wilson taught us how to makeourselves depressed,’ and there was a roar of laughter. Yet she had stated theessence of those group sessions. If you can raise yourself out of depression byan act of will, then you can also raise yourself out of ‘normal consciousness’into the peak experience.One of my literary chores during the earlier part of the year had been writingan introduction to The Occult Establishment by the late James Webb. Webb, one ofthe most brilliant minds of his generation, had committed suicide the previousyear, after a two-year mental illness. In the latter part of his illness, he hadkept up a correspondence with Joyce Collin-Smith, which she allowed me to read.It was clear that he had gone through a rather more severe version of my ‘panicattacks’, complete with delusions and hallucinations. He had allowed himself tobe ‘taken in’ by the depressions and, as a result, had been drawn far deeperinto ‘negative feedback’. Yet he fought back, and in those final months seemedto be regaining his balance, and recognizing that he had achieved completely newinsights into the problems that interested him so deeply—the hidden powers ofthe mind. The suicide seems to have been due to a momentary regression intopessimism. The Introduction remained unpublished, because his wife disagreedwith my view of his illness—she preferred to believe that it was ordinaryinsanity. But my study of Webb’s last letters made me more aware than ever ofthe nature of this problem. We ‘identify’ with our emotions. When I have a pain,I say, ‘It hurts.’ not, ‘I hurt.’Yet when I experience happiness I say, ‘I am happy;’ and when I experiencedepression, I say, ‘I feel gloomy.’ Writing about James Webb made me moreconvinced that feelings—particularly negative feelings—are an irrelevancy. The‘central ego’, the ‘unit of pure thought’, must learn to recognize that itremains the final arbiter. Feeling, like perception, is intentional.But these prescriptions seemed negative: to decline to be ‘taken in’ byfeelings, to regard a sudden depression as objectively as you would regard abruised knee-cap or a cold in the head. These formulae amounted toself-discipline, but the problem was not self-discipline so much as how toenlist the active support of that ‘other self’. This was the problem thatpreoccupied me when I arrived in Finland; this was the problem to which Bradpresented me with a simple and unambiguous answer. Brad told me, in effect:‘There is no problem whatever in contacting your “other self’’. It is perfectlywilling to contact you. You merely have to be willing to listen.’‘Listening’ must here be understood as an active suspension of our automaticfunctions, an attitude of vigilance, of alertness. Most of us waste about 90percent of our lives in purely automatic living. In order to suspend this, Imerely have to behave as if I am listening intently for some important noise,like the ringing of a telephone. And as I remain in this condition of‘openness’, my vital powers begin to rise in me, like water in a well.When I asked Brad to summarize the long-term results of his experience, hereplied in a long letter:‘During all these years there has been a continuing diffusion ofmovement-impulse moments into all possible areas of life—not continuouslytimewise, but whenever I choose to let it happen. And I have chosen to do so inmany different kinds of situations: when teaching, when taking part in adiscussion, when in sexual intercourse, when spending a day in town, when takinga shower, when preparing a lesson or talk, very often in the preparation ofthese materials for you. This “choosing to do so” means making the inner gestureof becoming silent and empty for a brief moment, a letting the decision about“what next” rise to the surface and take form via movement impulses.‘It has taken me several years to realize and learn that although this dimensionof experience emerged “by chance’’ in my life, it will continue only “bychoice”, i.e. by clear conscious wanting or willing to make the inner gesture ofchange-over from my usual mind-directed level of conscious behaviour in asituation, to the “movement-impulse level” which I feel represents a more whollyintegrated level of response in which my mind is just a part, co-existing andcollaborating with many other levels of myself, of my person.’One area in which Brad feels there has been a decisive change in his life isthat of human relationships:‘In recent years, and during this last year more than ever before, some kind of“living with love” or “living in love” has characterized my living, and it hasbeen transforming my experiences with my students, my fellow teachers, myfriends and acquaintances. Earlier in my life, from my teens onward, my tendencywas to limit and confine this sort of “whole open being and sharing” to onechosen relationship at a time, and, while that relationship continued, not allowmyself to have other “meetings” with others. There was a popular song in the1940s: “When I’m not near the girl I love, I love the girl I’m near.” Butbecause I was living according to a closed-relationship morality, those wordswere very threatening to me then. Now, I see the possibility of giving a newinterpretation to them—of understanding them to mean the deep promise of an openrelationship morality. Just this transition from closed exclusive relationshipsto open inclusive relationships is the direction of my growth and development atpresent...Because so much of my life has been spent within a closed-relationshipframework of values, now my venturing into the territory of open relationshipsis like moving in a new, unexplored territory without a map or compass. It isboth thrilling and threatening.‘Long ago, in an experience, I felt myself almost disintegrating into a flood offear (my “baby at the bottom of the well” experience). Now I have moments whenI’m almost disintegrating into a flood of joy...each cell would float offbuoyantly in a different direction...Recently, I have been experiencing these“deep peaks” several times a week. It has been like riding waves from crest tocrest without touching bottom in between...’Brad seems to feel that these basic changes may be regarded as a preparation forthe second part of his life. ‘I expressed this latter feeling last year when Itold a friend that I felt that something in me was getting ready to be born, andthat I felt as though I were the baby, the mother and the midwife, all at thesame time.Brad does not regard his present situation as some kind of ultimate. All stagesare transitional. Brad seems to me to have made an important discovery about howwe can enter into a new relationship with the unknown areas of the mind. Yet hisown experience has not been so much one of ‘access to inner worlds’ as of anactive collaboration with that ‘other self’ in this world. He remarks that newpossibilities ‘will open up as I become stronger and clearer in my ability towill the inner gesture of change-over from my usual mind-directed level ofconscious behaviour to the movement-impulse level’. He recognizes that thepresent stage is as rudimentary as a baby’s first efforts to walk or use itshand for grasping. ‘Whether the strengthening of my will will lead only to moresustained and continuous periods of living from that level, or whether it willalso lead to new levels of experience, I do not know.’ Neither is it importantthat he does not know. All that matters is to know that in our generation, inthe last part of the twentieth century, a new direction of evolution hassuddenly opened up in front of us."},{"pageContent":"The world-famous author of THE OUTSIDER shows how we may learn to achieveenlightenment.Access to Inner Worlds is Colin Wilson's considered response to the questionsraised in The Outsider.
