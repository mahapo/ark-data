At this time, the earth is dominated by giant telepathicspiders who breed human beings for food. They scour the skies in spiderballoons, seeking to bring under their control the few human beings who remainat large. These include Niall, a youth who daydreams of one day finding a way todestroy the spiders and restore men to freedom.A hundred miles to the west is the country known as the Great Delta, perhaps themost dangerous place in the world. And it is on a trip to the Delta, in searchof healing drugs, that Niall's uncle and cousin are killed by one of theman-eating plants.Ingeld, the dead man's widow, longs to return to her family home in theunderground city of Dira, near the great inland lake, and Niall and his father,Ulf, agree to escort her there. It is in Dira that Niall loses his heart to thebeautiful Princess Merlew, daughter of King Kazak, and is tempted to remain inthe underground city. But when he overhears Merlew describing him as \"thatskinny boy,\" he is disillusioned, and decides to return home with his father.It is during the journey home, driven to take refuge from a sandstorm in aruined city, that Niall kills a giant spider, and unintentionally seals the fateof Dira, which is overrun by the spiders soon after. And while Niall is awayfrom home, his own father is killed and his family taken captive by spiders.Niall sets out to follow them, but is himself soon taken prisoner.On a sea journey to the spider city, Niall is instrumental in saving the life ofone of the spiders, which has been washed overboard in a storm. The result isthat on his arrival in the spider city, he and his family are treated with acertain consideration, and are assigned to live in the palace of King Kazak, whohas become an ally and accomplice of the spiders. It is there that Niall learnsthat the spiders are engaged in a breeding experiment to reduce humanintelligence and to prevent men from ever again becoming a challenge to thespiders.It is when Niall discovers that Kazak is betraying his own people that he runsaway, and takes refuge in the mysterious white tower that dominates the centerof the spider city. This proves to be a time capsule, built by earlier men toinform their descendants of how they fled from the Earth to avoid a strike bythe radioactive comet Opik.Inside the white tower, in a sleep-learning machine, Niall is taught about thehistory of mankind before the Opik catastrophe. He also learns that the centerof the living force that created giant insects lies in the Delta; the spidersworship this force as the goddess Nuada.When he leaves the white tower, Niall takes refuge in the slave quarter, most ofwhose inhabitants have been turned into imbeciles by selective breeding.Appointed overseer to a squad of slaves, Niall finds his way to the nearby cityof the bombardier beetles, and renews his acquaintance with the explosivesexpert Bill Doggins. The beetles adore explosions, and Doggins has beenappointed to satisfy their immense appetite for this form of entertainment.Niall has arrived on \"Boomday,\" when Doggins is Master of Ceremonies at animmense firework display. But an accident results in a tremendous blast thatdestroys the whole remaining stock of explosives. Doggins decides that he has noalternative but to lead an expedition to the spider city, seeking a legendarystockpile of explosives in the abandoned barracks known as the Fortress.They are successful beyond their most optimistic dreams, discovering crates fullof \"reapers,\" an atomic blaster which is one of the most awesome weapons everinvented. Surprised by the spiders, they shoot their way out of trouble, stealspider balloons, and return to the city of the bombardier beetles, which isalready being besieged by spiders. Again, the reapers save the day. But whenNiall is ordered by the Master of the bombardier beetles to destroy the reapers,he decides to disobey, and to travel instead to the Delta, in a bid to destroythe force that has created the giant insects.Niall quickly discovers that the Delta deserves its reputation as the mostdangerous place on Earth. One by one, their party is reduced, until Niall andDoggins are the only ones to reach the foot of the great hill that they haveidentified as the center of the force. But it is Niall who finally scales thehill alone -- to learn that the \"goddess Nuada\" is actually a giant plant, whichhas been carried to Earth from another galaxy in the tail of the comet Opik.On his return to the city of the beetles, Niall is placed under arrest, andhanded over to the spiders. In a horrific encounter with the Spider Lord, hecomes close to being destroyed, both physically and mentally. But at this point,the goddess herself intervenes, filling the room with her strange blue light.Now convinced that Niall is the chosen of the goddess, the Spider Lord accedesto his demand that human beings should be set free. And Niall, to his ownbewilderment, suddenly finds himself appointed ruler of the spider city. Part OneThe Assasins Shortly before dawn he was awakened by a cold so intense that it reminded him ofthe desert night. He lay there, the bedclothes pulled around his face, and hisbreath formed moisture on the blanket as he exhaled. He had chosen this roombecause it faced east, and he liked to be awakened by the sun. Today there wasno sunlight; the dawn came like gray mist until the room was filled with a cold,even light. No birds sang.Something about the strange silence disturbed him. He crossed to the window,treading on the soft woolen rugs, and found himself looking out on a whitelandscape. White rooftops seemed to blend into the pearl-gray sky, and the greatsquare was carpeted in the same featureless whiteness. It had even found its wayinto the corners of the window frames, and a few fine flakes had frozen onto theoutside of the glass.Niall had heard about snow and read about it, but this was the first time he hadever seen it. Nothing had prepared him for this cold, beautiful whiteness thatseemed to blanket the universe. He was suddenly filled with a magical excitementwhich, although he was unaware of it, had filled thousands of generations ofchildren at the first sight of the winter snow.Possessed by a longing to touch this strange substance, he pulled on a sheepskinmantle over his tunic, thrust his feet into shoes lined with rabbit fur, andhurried out of the room. The palace was silent and its corridors empty; Niallwas usually the first awake. He mounted the staircase to the top floor, passingthe sleeping chamber shared by his cousin Dona and his sisters Runa and Mara,then climbed the narrow stairs that led up to the roof. As soon as he opened thedoor, a rampart of snow tumbled in and deluged his bare legs. He jumped backwith an exclamation; he had not realized snow would be so cold. Then he took offhis shoes one by one -- the snow had fallen into them -- and shook them out; thefur now felt cold and wet to his ankles. Yet the morning air seemed surprisinglywarm; this was because there was not the faintest breath of wind. The spacebetween the parapet and the steep roof was deep in snow; it crunched underfootas he trod in it. He picked up a double handful and molded it into a ball; butit froze his fingers, so he threw it away. With the sleeve of his mantle hecarefully brushed the snow from the parapet, then stood leaning on it, gazingout over the milky whiteness that extended as far as the distant hills. In thecenter of the parkland on the far side of the square, the white tower rose likea finger of ivory, but now that the surrounding grass was white, it was nolonger the most striking feature in the landscape. This distinction belonged tothe river, whose blackness split the cold plain like a current of ink; it madehim feel colder merely to look at it.The city seemed empty; there was not a living thing in sight. Then, as he turnedto go indoors, his attention was caught by a movement in the square below.Something black was lying in its northeastern corner. From this distance itmight have been an uprooted bush. Then he looked more closely, and saw the redstains in the snow; at the same time, another faint movement made him aware thathe was looking at a badly injured spider.He hurried back down the stairs, holding the balustrade because the snow on hisshoes made the marble treacherous. For a moment he was tempted to return to hisroom to put on warmer clothes; but his sense of urgency overruled thediscomfort. He pulled back the bar that locked the main door, and tramped outinto the deep snow, ignoring the cold wetness that ran down inside his shoes.The snow had turned the steps into a smooth ramp, so that he had to tread withextreme care; at one point he fell and plunged in up to his elbows. But as hestruggled to his feet and waded unevenly across the square, choosing a routewhere the snow lay thin, his mind was obsessed by a single problem: how a deathspider could have met with serious injury in such a wide open space.As he approached, the spider saw him, and it made a convulsive attempt to rise;but its jointed legs were not strong enough, and buckled under its weight. Theblack, hairy body was covered in snow; evidently it had been lying there forsome time. Niall found this puzzling; spiders are telepathic, and can send aninstant distress call to others of their kind. And since this one lay within afew hundred yards of the headquarters of the ruling directorate, on the far sideof the square, its presence should have been sensed the moment it was injured.When he came close enough to see the far side of its body he saw why it had beenunable to rise. Three of its legs had been smashed to a pulp; the bottom jointof one of them, with its black claw, was almost completely detached. A trail ofblood smears, partly obliterated by snow, showed that the spider had draggeditself for about fifty feet before it collapsed. It was obviously dying.\"What happened to you?\" Niall spoke the words aloud, but knew that his meaningwould be carried directly to the spider's brain.The reply that sounded inside his chest made him wince; it was a blur of pain,and the directness of the communication made Niall experience its misery andexhaustion, so that he himself felt drained and nauseated. It was impossible todistinguish what the spider was saying, but the \"voice\" was one that Niallinstantly recognized. It was Skorbo, the captain of the guard. Now Niallunderstood why its communication was an incomprehensible chaos of feeling. Theability to communicate with human beings was a difficult art -- the equivalentof a human being learning to read. In spider terms Skorbo was an illiteratepeasant, a creature whose chief value to his masters was a certain brutalstrength and the ability to dominate others. Niall had always found himrepellent; yet now that Skorbo was injured and dying, he felt overwhelmed withpity.He said: \"I'll go and get help.\"It was impossible to hurry through the snow; each step plunged him in up to theknee, and if he tried to withdraw the foot too quickly, he left his shoe behind.To avoid discouragement, he deliberately averted his eyes from the expanse ofsnow that stretched in front of him, and treated each step as an individualeffort. It was a pleasant surprise to find himself suddenly at the foot of thesteps in front of the headquarters building. Two wolf spiders would normallyhave been on guard outside its great double doors; the cold had evidently driventhem inside. Niall beat on the door with his fists, not because it was locked,but because he knew he would risk being attacked if he rushed in withoutwarning. There was a movement inside and the door opened; Niall found himselflooking up into the enormous black eyes of a brown wolf spider, whose height wasat least two feet greater than his own. The chelicerae (or pincers) wereextended, so he could see the folded fangs. A moment later, the spiderrecognized him, and sank down in a gesture of homage, lowering its belly to thefloor.Niall turned and pointed. \"Quick. Skorbo has been injured. Go and fetch him.\"Again, the words conveyed his message direct to the spider's brain. Followed bythe second guard, it loped across the square toward Skorbo, its enormousstrength unaffected by a mere foot of snow. Niall knew there was no point intrying to follow; his whole body felt drained. Instead, he sank down on a benchoutside the door, and watched as the guards gently lifted the injured spider. Asthey approached, he observed the way the legs dragged in the snow, and knew thatSkorbo was dead.They placed the body on the floor, scattering snow on the black marble. Skorbowas still bleeding; his blood was thicker, more viscous, than human blood, andit spread slowly, like a pool of oil. It was running from the spider's head,which lay sideways on the floor, and now Niall was able to see that there was ahole in the skull, about a foot above the single row of eyes that extended in aband around its head. Unlike human beings, spiders have no internal bonestructure; the armored shell is itself an external skeleton. Skorbo's skull hadbeen shattered by a blow. What puzzled Niall was that there seemed to befragments of broken armor in the hole, as might have been expected if sometremendous blow had been delivered from above. A large segment seemed to bemissing. Blood oozed from the hole as from the socket from which a tooth hasbeen pulled.The wolf spiders were standing there, too respectful to ask questions. Niallsaid: \"Please notify Dravig of what has happened. Tell him I shall be at home.\"But as he plodded back through the snow, curiosity overcame his weariness. Whathad happened struck him as completely incomprehensible. The hole in the skullmade it look as if Skorbo had been attacked. By whom? Another spider? Thatseemed unlikely. Unlike human beings, spiders seldom fought among themselves.Yet it was equally difficult to envisage some accident that might have causedthe damage.The obvious way to find out was to go and look. Niall retraced his steps, andtook the diagonal route across the plaza, where the forward rush of the wolfspiders had churned up the snow like some enormous plough. When he came to theplace where the injured spider had lain, he realized that Skorbo had lost agreat deal of blood; his life had oozed away into the snow as he lay there, hisbrain too damaged to send the signal that would have brought help. In front ofNiall, along the eastern side of the square, there were a number of empty housesin various states of disrepair. The city was full of such houses; spiders oftenmade their homes in the upper stories. But they preferred houses on either sideof the street, so they could weave their webs between them; this is why thehouses bordering the square had remained empty.The trail of blood had been obliterated by falling snow; but by bending untilhis face was within a few inches of the surface, he was able to make out thedarker patches. These, he could now see, led back toward the second house fromthe corner, a tall building whose rusty balconies suggested that it had oncebeen a hotel. Like the others, its windows had been boarded up and its door wasclosed -- all houses in this square had been forbidden to human beings. Nialltried the door; it seemed to be locked. Yet when he brushed aside the snow onthe doorstep with his shoe, a damp bloodstain told him that this was the housein which Skorbo had met his injury. He rammed the door with his shoulder; itseemed completely immovable. But a sheet of plywood covering a window proved tobe less solid, and caved inward when he pushed it with both hands.He leaned in with caution. If something -- or someone -- powerful enough to killa spider was lurking inside, he was going to take no risks. In fact, he foundhimself looking into a bare hallway whose wooden floor was covered with plasterand rubble; it smelled of decay and damp. Recognizing that his tension wasblocking his perceptions, he deliberately relaxed, exhaling deeply and closinghis eyes; then, as he achieved inner stillness, concentrated intently. A pointof light glowed inside his skull, and the silence seemed to deepen. In thatmoment, he knew with absolute certainty that no concealed enemies were lying inwait; the building was deserted. Yet this deeper perception also made him awareof another odor, musky and slightly sweet. It was familiar, yet its significanceescaped him.He pushed the plywood violently; the nails that held it to the window frame toreloose, and it fell into the building. Niall clambered inside. By now he wasregretting that he was not wearing warmer clothes; his hands and feet werefrozen. But since he was here, it seemed pointless not to explore. The lightfrom the window gave him a clearer view of the hallway. He observed ratdroppings among the dust and plaster on the floor. That indicated clearly thatno spiders used the building; they regarded rats as particularly appetizingdelicacies, and would wait for hours in the hope of catching one.As he expected, there were more bloodstains on the floor, and clear signs in thedust and rubble that a wounded spider had dragged itself across the floor. Themarks continued across the hallway to an open door beyond a collapsingstaircase; this admitted light and a draft of air. Beyond this, a corridor leddown to an open space that had once been a garden; there were more bloodstainson the floor. The door at the end, which stood half open, had obviously beenforced; its lock had been smashed, and marks on the outside woodwork made by achisel or a crowbar looked fresh.Niall peeped cautiously into the weed-grown garden, then looked upward at thewall above the door; it rose vertical and windowless to the roof, where theguttering was still intact. This disposed of his theory that the spider had beenstruck by some heavy object -- perhaps a piece of masonry -- dropped from above.Yet when he brushed aside the snow on the threshold, he saw signs of blood. Thisgarden clearly held the secret of the spider's death.To Niall's untrained eye there were no obvious clues. The layer of snow on theground had covered any footprints. The garden, which extended as far as the rearwall of the next building, was divided from the gardens to the right and left byhigh walls. A dozen feet from the door stood a young palm tree; beyond this,there was a tangle of weeds and shrubbery which offered a great deal ofconcealment. When Niall studied this more closely, he observed a number offreshly broken twigs which indicated that someone had been there recently. Butthe hard ground had retained no other indications.He penetrated the shrubbery as far as the rear wall; here the overgrown grassconvinced him that no one else had been here for months. But as he was about toturn back, he noticed something that made him pause. In a corner of the gardenwall there lay a heap of palm leaves, some of them spreading out from a commoncenter. They looked so natural in that setting that he almost failed to noticethem. But why should there be palm leaves lying in a corner? Then he looked upand saw that the young palm tree had no leaves. In fact, someone had hacked offits top, leaving a bare trunk. And within a foot of the top of the truncatedpalm, there was a length of rope.Now at last he understood. The tree was about twice the height of a man --precisely the distance from the foot of the tree to the rear door of thebuilding. A further search of the shrubbery revealed the stunted tree to whosebase the other end of the rope had been tied. The young palm had been bentbackwards like a catapult. When the spider had stepped out of the doorway,hesitating as it faced the dark garden, someone had cut the rope, and the treehad snapped over like an immense spring. Skorbo had evidently been standingslightly to one side, or had started to move at the last moment; the tree hadsmashed his legs and battered him to the ground. . .Niall returned to the doorway and looked down at the bloodstains. They showedclearly that his reconstruction was correct. The blow had caused blood splasheswhich were some distance from the original stain, and other splashes had struckthe wall at an angle so they were elongated, with tadpole-like tails. And a fewfeet away, half-buried in the snow, there was a triangular fragment of thespider's skull, with brain fragments still adhering to its underside. But theoriginal blow had shattered the legs, not the skull. This could mean only onething: that while the spider was stunned, someone had deliberately smashed thetop of his skull, with the intention of penetrating the brain and destroying hiscapacity to send out a distress signal.Niall shivered. He had no liking for Skorbo, but the sheer savagery of theattack horrified him; he felt as if he had been there to witness it.His shiver reminded him of how cold he was; his facial muscles had lost allfeeling and his eyelids felt as if they were frozen. He retraced his steps backthrough the empty building. The front door had been wedged shut with a balk oftimber. He heaved it loose and went out into the square.As he plodded back through the snow, walking in the deep footprints he had leftearlier, he recalled his excitement on first seeing the snow from his bedroomwindow. It had made the world look like fairyland. Now it was merely cold anduncomfortable, and somehow too real. Someone had lit a fire in the great fireplace that faced the main door; thesight of flames leaping up the chimney brought a glow of delight, and made himrealize why the men of old had regarded fire as a god. But as he stood beforethe blazing logs, watching the snow melt from his garments, he was surprised bythe pain in his limbs as the blood began to circulate again.In the chamber adjoining his bedroom, his personal servant Jarita had lit thestove and laid out his breakfast on a low table: cold meats, preserved fruits,honey, sweetened milk, and newly baked bread. Before he ate, he changed into dryclothes: a baggy woolen suit, in which he felt comfortable, and slippers linedwith down. Then he sat cross-legged on the silken cushions, tore a crust fromthe hot loaf, and spread it with butter and honey. This was usually the time ofday that he enjoyed most, the hour before work began, when he could eat goodfood, and reflect on the incredible twists of fortune that had brought him froma cave in the desert, and made him the ruler of fifty thousand human beings. Itwas an important hour of the day, for he was still stunned by the swiftness ofthe change, and his unconscious mind needed time to absorb it; he still woke upin the middle of the night and imagined that he was in the underground densurrounded by his family.But this morning he was unable to relax or to enjoy the food. He could onlybrood on the problem of why Skorbo had been killed, and who had carried it out.Both questions left him baffled. It was true that the city was full of humanbeings who loathed the captain of the guard and would be delighted with the newsof his death. But none of them possessed the kind of courage or determination tolure him into a trap. They had been the slaves of the spiders for so long thatthey no longer had any will of their own; they were conditioned into totalobedience. And there would have been no point in harboring thoughts of hatred orrevenge, for the spiders could read their minds more easily than Niall couldread a book.The men who had been captured from Kazak's underground city were a differentmatter. Their minds were still unviolated, and they had a long tradition ofhostility to spiders. But now that they were no longer slaves, they had nomotive for killing a spider. Most of them were now overseers and supervisors,and contented with their lot. They were delighted to be living in the open air,instead of in an underground fortress. Besides, even they lacked the kind ofcunning and ruthlessness necessary to have set the trap. . .There was a light tap on the door, and a tall, dark-haired girl looked in. Thiswas Nephtys, the commander of Niall's personal guard; because she knew he hatedto be disturbed at breakfast, she spoke with her eyes averted.\"The Lord Dravig is here.\"\"Ask him to come in.\" He smiled at her, wishing that his servants were not soafraid of him. But they had all been trained to fear and respect those who wereabove them. Their fear of the spiders was like that of a slave for some ruthlesstyrant. So they found it awe-inspiring that Niall should speak on equal termswith the tyrants. The point was reinforced when Dravig entered the room, andNephtys prostrated herself in front of the spider at the same time that Dravigmade a ritual gesture of obeisance before Niall.Dravig was probably the oldest spider in the land, with the exception of theancient female spider who presided over the ruling council of the city. He stoodmore than seven feet tall, but was thin and gaunt, and the hairs on his bodywere turning gray. Insofar as it was possible for a spider to understand a humanbeing, and for a human being to understand a spider, these two understood oneanother.Niall moved away from the table and sat on a cushion on the dais. It would havebeen impolite to continue his breakfast. For some reason, the spiders wereprofoundly disturbed by the sight of human beings eating or drinking -- perhapsin the same way that a human being would be disturbed at the sight of a spidereating a fly or a rat.He wasted no time on preliminaries. \"Do you know that Skorbo is dead?\"\"Yes.\"\"Have you any idea who did it?\"\"No.\"During this dialogue, Niall spoke aloud while Dravig communicatedtelepathically. Niall was also communicating telepathically -- spiders wereunable to understand human language -- but he found it easier to speak his wordsaloud; it seemed to give his thought an added precision.\"Is the Spider Lord very angry?\" Although the ruler was a female, she was knownto human beings as the Spider Lord.\"Of course. But she will abide by the agreement.\" Dravig understood the questionthat Niall had in mind -- this was the advantage of speaking telepathically.While human beings had been slaves, the death of a single spider had beenpunished with appalling ferocity -- sometimes with the torture and execution ofa hundred humans. When the slaves became free, the Spider Lord had agreed thatthere should be no more killing.Niall said: \"Nevertheless, if the murderers can be found, they must bepunished.\"\"That is your decision. We shall abide by the agreement.\"There was a silence between them, but it was the silence of understanding.Intelligence had bridged the gap between their two species, so that it was as ifboth were human or both were spiders.Dravig said: \"But I cannot understand how human beings could kill a spider.\"Niall stood up. \"Come with me and I will show you.\"On the spot where the injured spider had collapsed, a platoon of slaves wasshoveling the snow into handcarts and washing away the blood with buckets ofwarm water. It would have been regarded as a kind of sacrilege to leave thespider's blood staining the ground. As Niall and Dravig went past, the overseercracked his whip and made the slaves stand to attention. Niall averted his gaze;the blank eyes and drooling mouths of the slaves always made him feeluncomfortable.The door stood half open, exactly as Niall had left it. As they entered therubble-strewn hallway, the spider paused and his chelicerae unfolded; Niall wasaware that something had galvanized him into sudden alertness. But the spidersaid nothing. After a moment, he followed Niall down the passageway and out intothe garden.Niall pointed at the truncated palm tree. \"That was what killed Skorbo.\"Dravig failed to understand. Spiders were completely lacking in mechanicalaptitude. Niall had to transmit a mental picture before Dravig could understandhow a tree could be used as a murder weapon. Even then, he seemed skeptical.Niall had to point out the rope still tied to the top of the tree, and to thebloodspots on the wall, before the spider was convinced.Niall also pointed out the shape of the blood splashes, with their tadpole-liketails, indicating that they had flown upwards due to the force of the blow.Dravig said with astonishment: \"The human mind is amazingly subtle.\"Niall pointed to the fragment of bone lying in the snow.\"The blow failed to kill him because it struck him to one side, breaking hislegs. While he was still stunned, someone attacked him with some heavy weapon --probably an ax -- and shattered his skull. That is why he failed to send out adistress signal.\"Dravig said: \"Whoever is responsible will pay for this.\" The force of his angerwas so great that it struck Niall like a blow, causing him to step backward. Herealized then that he had underestimated the strength of Dravig's feelings. Fora human being, the murder of a spider could be regarded with detachment. ForDravig, it was the slaughter of a fellow creature, and it filled him with rageand a desire for revenge.Dravig was instantly aware of the effect produced by his anger on Niall; he madea mental gesture of abasement and apology, to which Niall replied with a similargesture indicating that apology was unnecessary. In human language the exchangewould have been expressed: \"I am sorry. I did not mean to upset (or shock orstartle) you;\" \"Please do not apologize, I understand perfectly.\" Instead, thesemeanings were conveyed instantaneously, and with a precision beyond the power oflanguage. It made Niall aware of the crudity and clumsiness of human speech.Dravig advanced toward the palm tree, and gripped it with his pincers and withhis four front legs. Niall looked on with a perplexity that changed toembarrassment; surely Dravig realized that it would take far more than thestrength of a single spider to uproot a tree? His embarrassment changed toastonishment as he watched the spider's legs brace and strain, and heard thetearing sound as the roots began to loosen. This was not merely physicalstrength; it was will power intensified by rage. The spider staggered for amoment as the earth under his feet heaved upwards; he regained his balance andagain braced himself. A moment later, the tree was ripped out of the earth. Witha gesture of contempt, Dravig threw it away from him, and it crashed down ontothe bushes.Dravig said nothing, but Niall could sense that the effort had relieved some ofhis rage and frustration.Niall stepped forward and looked down into the hole, with its torn rootsprotruding from loose brown earth. The two main roots had been snapped in two;the strength required must have been tremendous. Yet Dravig showed no sign ofeffort; he was not even breathing heavily. Niall realized that he had used hisimmense will-force -- the will-force that could knock a human being unconscious-- to galvanize his muscles into this unbelievable effort. And, as so oftensince he had been in contact with the death spiders, Niall caught a glimpse ofthe great secret forces of the will.Something caught his eye in the loose earth. He bent down and picked up agray-colored object that lay between the roots. It was a disc, about four inchesin diameter, and its weight surprised him. Niall had heard of lead, although hehad never seen it; now he guessed that this was what he was holding.When he brushed off the earth, he saw that a simple design had been carved intoone of the surfaces; this consisted of four curved lines. [0001.jpg] Dravig asked: \"What is it?\" Niall held out the disc, and the spider took it inhis claw.Niall said: \"It was in the hole. It must have been there when the tree wasplanted.\"\"Does it mean anything to you?\"\"No.\"The spider dropped it; Niall picked it up. \"I'll take it with me. I'd like tofind out what it is.\"It was too heavy for the pocket of his mantle, so he placed it beside thedoorway.Dravig was looking among the bushes. Niall pointed to the rope tied round thebase of the stunted tree.\"This is the other end of the rope they used. Someone must have cut it as Skorbocame out of the doorway.\"Whatever had been used to cut the rope -- either an ax or a knife -- had beenrazor-sharp; there were no frayed ends.Dravig asked: \"Have you any more observations?\"Niall considered. He allowed himself to remain silent for a long time, awarethat the patience of spiders is far greater than that of human beings. He saidfinally: \"Whoever did this planned it carefully. In my opinion there must havebeen at least three of them. And for some reason they hated Skorbo.\"\"You believe that Skorbo was the intended victim?\"\"I am inclined to think so.\" Niall decided against explaining why Skorbo wasdisliked; it would have seemed discourtesy toward the dead. And Dravig, whosensed that Niall had more to say, was too tactful to press him.Niall said: \"They probably entered by the front door. But they did not leave byit. They had propped it closed with a balk of timber. That means they must haveclimbed over the wall. . . Ah yes.\"He had pushed himself through the gap between the bushes and the left-hand wall,and now found a low gate in the wall. It was made of iron, and was rusted. Yetwhen he pushed it, the gate swung upon its hinges without a creak. A glance atthese hinges showed that they had been greased.The gate led into a narrow lane, which ran between two garden walls. It hadobviously been constructed to afford entrance into the gardens, and a few yardsfrom the gate, it terminated in the wall of the house. In the other direction,it ran on for about a hundred yards before it was blocked with rubble where awall had collapsed.Dravig had found it easier to step over the wall than to squeeze his bulkthrough the gate; now he stood beside Niall in the snow-covered lane. Anyfootprints that had been left behind had been obliterated by the more recentsnowfall. Both stood there silently; Niall had discovered that being with aspider placed him in a calm and contemplative frame of mind, and that thissharpened his powers of intuition. So far his mind had been full of questionsand observations, and this made him abnormally aware of his physicalsurroundings, as if they were thrusting themselves insistently against hissenses. Now, quite suddenly, he relaxed, and it was as if the physical world hadreceded. The discomfort of his cold hands and feet became irrelevant, as if theybelonged to someone else. In this new silence, he experienced a kind ofawakening of attention, as if some unusual sound or smell was hovering on theedge of his perceptions. As he stood there, totally relaxed, it became stronger.There was something unpleasant about it, something distinctly menacing.Dravig also stood motionless, without a hint of impatience; yet Niall's contactwith his mind told him that the spider was completely oblivious to this sense ofunpleasantness. It had often struck him as curious that, in spite of theirtelepathic powers, spiders seemed oddly lacking in intuition. Perhaps it wasbecause they had so little to fear.Niall walked on slowly, his head averted as if listening. Because his eyes wereon the ground, he noticed the footprints close to the left-hand wall. There werehalf a dozen of them, and they were pointing in the opposite direction; whoevermade them had wandered to one side of the path for a few steps, then returned tothe center. Because the breeze had been blowing from the north, the footprintshad been protected by the wall, and were covered with only a light powdering ofthe snow that had fallen later. Now Niall paused and examined them closely,kneeling down in the snow. The first thing that struck him was that they hadbeen made by sandals -- or shoes -- of excellent workmanship. Most of thesandals worn by the workmen of this city were poorly made; thick leather solesheld on to the foot by leather thongs or strips of reinforced cloth, which werethreaded through holes in the leather. In order to prevent these thongs frombecoming worn where they made contact with the ground, holes were countersunk inthe sole to minimize the friction. So a footprint made by a workman or a slavewas quite distinctive, with its three pairs of holes. On the other hand, thehuman beings captured from Kazak's underground city wore more elaboratefootwear. Having far more time at their disposal, the shoemakers of Dira tookpride in their craft, and sewed broad leather straps to the sole with waxedthread. The soles themselves were shaped to correspond exactly to the outline ofthe human foot. It seemed likely, then, that these footprints in the snow hadbeen made by a man of Dira.Dravig asked: \"These are the footprints of one of the assassins?\"\"Yes.\"\"They seem to interest you.\"\"I am puzzled. If you look at my own footprints, you will see that they havebeen made with an even pressure -- the heel and the sole are of equal depth. Inthese, the heel is far deeper than the sole.\"\"I see that.\" Dravig's tone was polite, but Niall sensed that the spider foundhis interest incomprehensible. The spider mentality seemed averse tomathematical logic. \"And what do you infer?\"Niall straightened up, shaking his head. \"That he was carrying something heavy.\"But he was far from convinced by his own reasoning.Fifty paces further on, the path was partly blocked with rubble where theleft-hand wall had collapsed. On the other side of it there was an overgrowngarden; the house to which it belonged had once been large, but had now falleninto ruin. Niall paused and stood looking at the house. Once again he had thesense that something was hovering on the edge of his perceptions, like amovement glimpsed out of the corner of his eye. Stepping carefully, he made hisway over the fallen stones and into the garden. Instinct told him to turn leftand make his way toward a gap in the shrubbery. It was only when he was therethat he noticed that there was less snow on these bushes than on the surroundingones, and that somebody had probably brushed past them, shaking the snow ontothe ground.A dozen yards from the house, he found his path blocked by an empty swimmingpool. Its plastic material had long ago become cracked and coated with blackmildew; only in places were there glimpses of its original blue color. Thebottom was covered with rubbish: dead leaves, fallen slates, and broken glass.But what immediately attracted Niall's attention was the pile of more recentrubbish on the side nearest the house. In the corner of the pool, at the foot ofan aluminum ladder that was still firmly attached to the side, there were deadbranches, pieces of rotten timber, and a quantity of fallen leaves mixed withsnow.Dravig was standing silently behind him. Niall asked: \"Do you notice anything?\"\"No.\" The spider's antennae were directed toward the pool.\"There's almost no snow on that lawn. Somebody has gone to the trouble ofgathering all the dead leaves\" -- he pointed down into the pool -- \"and throwingthem in there.\"He went around the pool and clambered down the ladder; as he did so he notedthat the steps were almost free of snow. Standing at the bottom, he reached outand grabbed the end of a length of decaying timber that looked as if it had oncebeen the frame of a door. As he heaved it free, and a dead bush also came awaywith it, he saw what he had been half-expecting: a human leg protruding from thewet leaves.A moment later, Dravig was beside him, clearing away the dead branches. Thecorpse that was exposed was naked; it was a man, and his head and limbs wereswollen to almost balloon-like proportions. The face had turned black, andlooked as if it was made of shiny leather. Niall felt the energies drain fromhis heart; it reminded him of his father's corpse as it lay across the thresholdof their underground home in the desert.Dravig said with satisfaction: \"Skorbo managed to kill one of them before hedied.\"Niall leaned forward cautiously until his nostrils assured him that, in spite ofits bloated appearance, the corpse had not yet started to decay. He took hold ofthe foot and pulled the body clear of the dead leaves. The eyes were open andthe lips drawn back from the teeth; he had obviously died in agony. The kneeswere bent grotesquely in rigor mortis.Dravig asked: \"Do you know him?\"\"No.\" The swelling made recognition impossible.Niall turned away; the staring eyes and exposed teeth made him feel sick. Heclimbed the ladder back to the lawn; suddenly he was glad it was cold. On a hotday the corpse would already have been surrounded by bluebottles. And sincebluebottles were the size of small birds, the corpse would soon have beendevoured.Niall stood staring at the lawn. Only a few hours earlier, men had worked in thedarkness, gathering armfuls of snow and dead leaves to conceal the corpse; theyshould have left behind some clue to their identity. But the recent snow hadburied all the clues. But why should they take so much trouble to hide the body?Did they mean to return later to give it a decent burial? Niall dismissed thatidea. The man's clothes had been removed because they might afford a clue to hisidentity; the body had probably been concealed for the same reason. But thatsuggested that the killers were men who belonged to this city. And Niall foundsuch an idea almost unbelievable.Dravig had been waiting patiently while Niall stood there, lost in thought. AsNiall shook his head and sighed, Dravig asked: \"Do you have any idea who mightbe responsible?\"\"None. The whole thing is completely baffling.\"From over the rooftops came the sound of a gong. In the days when men wereenslaved, it had been used to announce the evening curfew; anyone found abroadafter that time was subject to instant execution. Now it was used in themornings to announce the beginning of the working day.Niall said: \"I must go back. There is a meeting of the Council in half an hour.\"Its full title was the Council of Free Men, but Niall shortened it in order toavoid the risk of causing offense.As they walked back through the bushes, Niall observed something that had caughton a twig. It was a fine, thin chain made of a gold-colored metal; suspended onit there was a medallion of the same color. One side was blank; on the other wasthe symbol that he had already seen once that morning. Niall held it out on thepalm of his hand. But Dravig stared at it blankly. The spider mentality, for allits intelligence, found symbols incomprehensible.Niall said: \"It is the same sign we found on the lead disc under the tree.\"\"But what does it mean?\"\"I don't know. But I shall try to find out.\"As they returned along the path between the walls, Niall stopped and pointed tothe footprints.\"Now I understand why the heel is deeper than the toes. He was walkingbackwards, helping to carry the body.\"\"But why did they not leave the body where it was?\"\"By removing it, they thought they were leaving no clues behind. If the snow hadbeen heavier, we would never have discovered how Skorbo died.\"Dravig said: \"The snow was their ally.\"\"And also their enemy.\"In the damp-smelling hallway, with its dust and rubble, Niall paused again tolook around. This time he was able to find the prints of two sets of sandals inthe dust. He said: \"There is still one thing I cannot understand. How did theylure Skorbo into the building?\"\"I can tell you that.\" Niall stared at him in surprise. \"They used the scent ofa female spider in season.\"\"Of course!\" It was the smell that had intrigued Niall when he first steppedinto the hallway. When he had returned with Dravig, it had gone. But thespider's more acute senses had detected it.Dravig said: \"What do you wish me to say to the Death Lord?\"The question took Niall by surprise. After all, he had nothing to do withSkorbo's death. Now, suddenly, he realized that his attitude revealed a lack ofmaturity and understanding. He was the ruler of all the human beings in thiscity. Therefore, the murder was his responsibility, whether he liked it or not.He said: \"Please tell the Death Lord that I shall do everything in my power tofind the criminals. When they are found, they shall be handed over to you forpunishment.\"\"Thank you.\" Their minds made momentary contact; it was the equivalent of ahuman handshake. Then Dravig turned away and went out into the square. When heand Niall were alone, he omitted the ritual gestures of homage, knowing thatNiall found them embarrassing. Dravig would have preferred to make the gestures;like all spiders, he found them natural and satisfying to his sense of order.That he omitted them now was a sign of friendship and respect.About to follow Dravig into the square, Niall remembered the leaden disc, whichhe had left outside the door that led into the garden. He went back down thecorridor. The disc was gone. Niall could remember the exact spot where he hadleft it; in fact the indentation was still in the snow, with some faint earthmarks.The slaves were now clearing the snow from the pavement in front of the house.The overseer, a powerfully built man whose face looked as if it had been carvedout of wood, snapped to attention as Niall approached.Niall asked: \"What is your name?\"\"Dion, sir.\"\"Have you seen anyone go into that house in the last ten minutes?\"\"No, sir.\"Niall was probing his mind as he spoke, and could see he was telling the truth.\"None of the slaves has been in there?\"\"No, sir.\" This time, Niall sensed his hesitation. It was understandable enough.Watching slaves shoveling snow was scarcely a demanding job; what could be morenatural than turning his back and gazing into the distance?Niall looked thoughtfully at the slaves. It seemed inconceivable that any ofthese pathetic creatures could have taken the disc. To begin with, it would betoo heavy for the pockets of their garments. Slaves were notoriously inclined tosteal, but they were usually interested in food, or attractive shining objects.Niall scanned the minds of those who were closest to him. It was as he hadexpected. Slaves seemed to live in a permanent mental fog, a perpetual presentwithout past or future; their minds were little more than a reflection of theirenvironment. By comparison, even the overseer was an intellectual prodigy. Niallalways found it depressing to probe the minds of slaves; they took theiremptiness so completely for granted that it was contagious, like a disease.Niall said: \"Listen to me, Dion. Behind this house there is a garden with a gatein the wall. Follow my footprints along the lane. They will lead you to an emptyswimming pool, in which you will find the body of a man. Have him carried to mypalace. Do you understand?\"\"Yes, sir.\" If the man was surprised, his face showed no sign of it. Under thespiders, the overseers had been trained to obey like machines. As he retraced his footsteps through the snow, Niall was lost in thought. Theevents of the past few hours had left him baffled. Yet he found them irritatingand puzzling rather than alarming -- a tiresome interruption of more importantaffairs.The past six months had been the most absorbing and exciting of his life. Sincethe spiders had granted men their freedom, life had become a continuousadventure. In the days of slavery, men had not been allowed to use their minds.Children had been raised in strictly supervised nurseries; any who showed signsof unusual intelligence were destroyed. Books had been forbidden; so had anyform of mechanical device. Even the servants of the bombardier beetles, who hadalways enjoyed relative freedom, had been forbidden to construct any kind ofmachine on pain of death.In practice, the beetle servants had ignored the prohibition; for generations,their children had secretly learned to read. But the men of the spider city hadbeen allowed no such latitude. Ever since birth, their minds had beensystematically violated by their masters; even their most secret thoughts hadbeen open to inspection by the spiders. Most of them had never even dreamed ofthe possibility of freedom.The men of Dira were a different matter. Until their capture by the spiders lessthan a year ago, they had always been free. But their minds had been cramped bygenerations of confinement in an underground fortress, and by the need for thestrictest obedience if they were to avoid the vigilance of spider patrols. Inorder to guarantee their safety, their rulers -- like the late King Kazak -- haddemanded total submission and loyalty. Even the women of Dira were treated byKazak as his private harem. So the men of Dira were almost as ill equipped asthe men of the spider city to deal with the experience of self-determination.It had not taken Niall long to realize that men need to be taught to exercisetheir freedom. Too much freedom bewildered them and made them lazy. So the menof the spider city continued to go to work daily under the supervision of thefemale commanders. But these commanders were now -- theoretically at least --under the orders of the Council of Free Men. In fact, they continued to workclosely with their old masters; they regarded the spiders with a loyalty thathad been instilled into them since childhood. As far as they were concerned,Niall was merely an overseer who had been appointed by the spiders. They had nodesire for \"freedom.\"Yet humans differed from spiders in one basic respect: their craving fornovelty. Niall had soon recognized that this could be used to increase theircapacity for freedom. The beetle servants were now manufacturing all kinds ofnovelties: pressure lamps, clocks, kitchen appliances, mechanical toys, electrictorches, children's picture books, even bicycles. When the first examples ofthese things were seen in the spider city, they created a sensation. Mechanicaltoys were in such demand that grown men would barter their food and clothing forthem. But the men of the spider city possessed few goods that could be used forbarter -- one man had been known to offer a hundred hours of manual labor inexchange for a pressure lamp. Recognizing their frustration, Niall decided tooffer them the most startling novelty so far: money. In exchange for their dailywork, men were paid in brass coins, cast in the newly built mint. They could usethese coins to purchase food, clothing, and \"novelties.\"The results surpassed all Niall's expectations. Within weeks, all the men wereworking longer hours to accumulate more money to buy the novelties. After dark,the windows of the city glowed with the lights of pressure lamps. Manufacturersof clothing and footwear began to produce \"luxury\" goods that could commandhigher prices. Bakers began to create cakes and tarts and sweetmeats, and thecoarse gray bread that had been the staple diet of human beings for as long asthey could remember gave way to a fine white bread that was baked daily. The useof dyes spread from the city of the bombardier beetles; soon all the women ofthe spider city were wearing brightly colored garments and necklaces of glassbeads. As men and women were once again allowed to live together -- the spidershad kept them segregated -- they ceased to live communally in basements, andbegan taking over empty buildings. Nearly all the windows in the spider city hadbeen broken; now the beetle servants taught the art of glass manufacture, andmen and women spent their free time repairing and decorating their new homes.After nightfall, the spider city had once been dark and silent; now its streetswere more crowded in the evening than during the day. And the men and women whowalked the streets had a new sense of confidence and responsibility; Niall couldsee it in their eyes, and it filled him with satisfaction. He had no illusions;he knew that most of them were little better than innocent and greedy children.Nevertheless, it was a beginning. In a few generations -- perhaps after Niall'sdeath -- they would be capable of shaping their own destiny.This is why Niall was so excited at the thought of the Council meeting. Everymeeting was a landmark. Four of the twenty members were from the city of thebombardier beetles, and during the early meetings, they had dominated theproceedings with their suggestions and advice; now it would take a veryperceptive observer to guess which of the members were beetle servants. At thelast meeting, one man had suggested that the darker streets should be lighted bylarge pressure lamps, which should be paid for jointly by all the inhabitants ofthe street; only Niall realized that the streets of ancient cities had beenilluminated by municipal lighting. Another man, a cook who had once prepared anightly meal for a hundred men, and who now lived with his wife and child, hadasked permission to convert an empty room into a dining hall, where men andwomen could come and buy the meals that he and his wife would cook; only Niallknew that restaurants were almost as old as civilization. And the charioteers,who had once worked exclusively for the commanders, and spent most of their dayswaiting for their masters, were now suggesting banding together to create apublic transport system. It was exciting to realize that all these people --Niall thought of them as his people -- were embarking on an adventure ofself-development, and that one day their story would occupy an important placein the history books.And now, just as men were beginning to understand the meaning of freedom, thismurder threatened to undermine everything they had accomplished. Niall was awarethat many of the spiders resented this new situation; they regarded human beingsas slaves whose lives were as unimportant as those of the lowest kind of insect.Now they had been told that these human vermin were under the special protectionof Nuada, the Goddess of the Delta, and that the Spider Lord had ordered thatthey were to be treated as equals under the Law. That was, of course,preposterous. Nothing could make a spider regard a human being as his equal. Butbecause they were accustomed to obedience, they observed the letter of the Law,and ceased to treat human beings as slaves. They continued to regard them withcontempt, but they no longer showed it openly. And because human beingscontinued to regard the spiders with fear and respect, there was no openfriction.But if these human lice could murder a spider, then the whole situation hadbecome outrageous. It would surely deserve the utmost severity -- as in the olddays, when rebels had been tortured and executed in batches of a hundred at atime.Dravig had said that the Spider Lord would stick to the agreement; human lifewould continue to be respected. But since spiders were telepathic, they were farmore aware of one another's feelings than human beings were. If the feelingbecame too strong, even the despotic old Spider Lord might feel obliged tochange her policy. . .Niall was aroused from these disquieting reflections by the sight of twocharioteers who were laboring breathlessly through the deep snow; behind them inthe cart sat a big, fleshy man, who was shaking his head with visibleimpatience. Niall recognized him as an overseer named Broadus, a prominentmember of the Council of Free Men. When he saw Niall, the expression ofirritation dissolved into an ingratiating smile. He made a bow from a sittingposition.\"Good morning, highness. I'm sorry I'm late.\"\"Good morning, Broadus.\" (Broadus's smile changed into something like a smirk;he loved hearing his name spoken aloud.) \"I'm afraid we're all late. Would youtell the Council I'll be with them in a few minutes?\"\"Certainly, highness.\" He shot a wrathful glance at the charioteers as heclambered out into the snow.As Niall started to mount the stairs, Nephtys came hurrying down to meet him.She said in a whisper: \"The Princess Merlew is waiting to see you.\"\"Oh no! I've got a Council meeting.\"\"I've told her that.\"\"All right. Thank you, Nephtys.\"As he approached his chamber, the door opened and Merlew came out; she must havebeen waiting behind it.\"Good morning, Niall.\"\"Good morning, princess.\" He deliberately used the formal title.She was looking dazzlingly beautiful in a short dress of red spider silk whichclung to the curves of her body; her red-gold hair was combed straight down herback.\"You must be cold.\" She took his hands in both of hers. \"Oh yes, you're frozen!So is your face.\" She had placed her hands on his cheeks; they felt pleasantlywarm. He felt his impatience melting away; he had never been able to maintain anattitude of coolness toward Merlew.\"I've got a Council meeting. . .\"\"I know. You can keep them waiting. That's your prerogative.\"\"Punctuality is the politeness of kings.\"She laughed. \"That's clever! I must remember that.\"He was tempted to tell her that he had found it in an old book, but sheinterrupted him.\"I've got a present for you.\"He grunted noncommittally; he was pulling off his boots, and the thick woolensocks.\"It's a new servant girl. Her name is Savitri. I've trained her myself.\"He was buckling his sandal, and was glad his face was averted. \"Thank you, but Ican't accept her.\"\"Why not?\"\"This house is run by women -- it might cause problems.\"\"I'm sure it wouldn't. I'll speak to your mother.\"\"I'd rather you didn't. Why don't you give her to my brother?\"\"Because Veig ...\" She lowered her voice. \"Because Veig already has enough bodyservants.\" She laid a delicate emphasis on the word \"body.\" Veig was notoriousfor his susceptibility to attractive girls.\"So have I.\"She sighed. \"I wish you weren't so hard to please.\" She took from his hands thebelt with the ceremonial shortsword, and passed it round his waist. For amoment, her pointed breasts pressed against his chest, and her lips came close.In that moment he realized how easy it would be to relent and say yes. All thatrestrained him was the knowledge that his womenfolk would regard the new girl asa spy, and resent her accordingly. As Merlew finished buckling his belt he said:\"I have to go.\"\"There's something else I have to tell you.\"\"Yes?\" He hesitated at the door.She stepped back and lowered her eyes; it was a reaction that always made himsuspicious.\"I've heard a rumor. . . The Council intends to ask you to get married.\"\"Married!\" He was genuinely taken aback.She said quickly: \"It's nothing to do with me. I only heard it secondhand.\" Shereached up and made an adjustment to the front of his tunic.He looked down at her quizzically. \"And what do you think?\"\"I quite agree, of course.\" She colored. \"I'm not suggesting you should marryme. There are plenty of nice girls among the commanders.\" He made a movement ofimpatience. \"But you do need someone to help you.\"He should have known from past experience that she could exert an almosthypnotic power of attraction. Yet it never failed to take him by surprise. Hewas aware that she had put on this red dress for his benefit, and that she worea perfume distilled from gorse flowers because she knew it was his favorite. Butshe exuded a magic that made these things unimportant; it was urging him to takehold of her bare shoulders and kiss her mouth. He looked away from her with aneffort.\"I'm afraid we shan't be discussing marriage this morning.\"She looked up quickly. \"Why not?\"\"There's something more important. Have you heard about Skorbo?\"She shook her head.\"He's been murdered.\"\"Oh no!\" Her surprise was genuine; he was able to see into her mind as shespoke, and he could register her sense of shock. That came as a relief. Merlewhad detested Skorbo, and it had crossed Niall's mind that she might be behindthe murder.Merlew was also intelligent enough to understand the implications of thekilling, and they worried her. She was Kazak's daughter, and she knew how thespiders would react. \"Who can have done it?\"\"I have no idea.\"\"Surely not a human? Are you sure it wasn't another spider?\"\"No. It was a human all right. But now I have to go.\"This time she made no attempt to detain him. Yet it cost him an effort to leaveher. As he hurried along the corridor, he shook his head with amusement. He hadcaught himself feeling a flash of gratitude to Skorbo's assassins fordistracting Merlew.The Council of Free Men met in the main dining hall of the palace. (In fact,Niall's researches had revealed that the \"palace\" had once been the RoyalInsurance Building, and that the council chamber had been its board room.) Now,as he crossed the main hall toward its great double doors, someone waved to himfrom a curtained recess. From the shabby green tunic, the color of dying moss,Niall recognized Simeon, the chief physician of the city of the bombardierbeetles. Since the days of freedom, Simeon had founded a college of medicine. Hewas also one of the most active members of the Council. At the moment, it wasobvious that he was anxious not to be seen. As Niall approached, he disappearedbehind the curtain. Niall followed.Simeon said quickly: \"A word in your ear. The Council has got some plan to marryyou off.\"\"I know.\"\"Who told you?\"\"Merlew.\"Simeon grunted sarcastically. \"She's behind it.\"\"Who proposed it?\"\"Corbin.\"\"I should have guessed.\" Corbin was also a member of the stadion, the council ofthe city of the beetles; he and Merlew had always been friendly.\"I thought I'd better warn you anyway.\"\"Thanks. Now we'd better go -- we're late.\"Simeon said: \"Let me go first and give me two minutes. I don't want them torealize we've been speaking.\"Niall smiled ironically as he watched him go; it seemed absurd that being aruler of men involved so much plotting and counterplotting.There was a knock on the main door; since there were no servants nearby, Niallwent and opened it himself. The overseer Dion was standing there; behind himstood half a dozen slaves, carrying the corpse on an improvised stretcher madeof planks.\"Where shall we put him, sir?\"\"On the table there.\"Dion shook his head. \"I wouldn't advise putting him too near a fire, sir. He'llstart to pong.\"\"No, of course. Have the table carried out into the courtyard and put him onit.\"Dion beckoned for more slaves. Niall hurried into the council chamber.The members were talking earnestly among themselves, and at first failed tonotice his entrance. Then all jumped to their feet, and raised both arms tochest level in a ritual salute.\"Please sit down, gentlemen. I'm sorry I'm late.\" He drew up his chair at thehead of the table. \"We have some important business. . .\"Broadus, whose seat was next to Niall, jumped to his feet with a deferentialsmile.\"Very important business, if I may say so, highness. Perhaps I may. . .\"Niall raised his hand. \"One moment please, Councilor Broadus. Gentlemen, I wouldlike you all to look out the window.\"All turned and looked outside. The door into the courtyard had opened, and fourslaves carried out the table into the snow. There were sharp intakes of breathas the others followed with the corpse, and lifted it onto the tabletop.Simeon was the first to speak. \"Who is that?\" He was so surprised that he forgotto address Niall as \"sire,\" a formality he always observed at Council meetings.\"I don't know. I was hoping one of you might be able to tell me. Would you mindstepping outside?\"A door from the chamber led directly into the courtyard. They all followed Niallinto the cold air. The face of the dead man was blacker and more swollen thanwhen Niall had last seen it. The Council of Free Men looked at him withdistaste, but without revulsion; this was not the first time they had seen thebody of a man killed by spider venom.\"Does anyone recognize him?\"Some moved to get a better view; one by one, all shook their heads.\"Simeon, could he be from your city?\"\"No. I know every man there. This isn't one of them.\"As they looked at the corpse, Niall watched them carefully, his mind receptiveto impressions. It was obvious to him that none of them knew anything aboutSkorbo's death.Simeon was peering closely at the feet. He asked Niall: \"Notice anything?\"Niall studied them closely. \"They're unusually hairy.\" The man's legs, and theupper portions of his feet, were covered with dark hairs.\"Not that.\" Simeon took hold of two of the dead man's toes, and pulled themapart. \"Look. He was born with webbed feet, like a duck. The webs were severedlater.\"Mastering his revulsion, Niall looked more closely, and was able to see theflaps of loose skin between the big toe and its companion. He shook his head.\"What does it mean?\"\"Just a birth defect -- I've seen it once or twice. But it proves that he wasn'tborn in this city.\"Some of the others looked puzzled. But Niall understood his meaning. The spidersbred human beings for physical perfection; those who had the slightest defectwere killed at birth.Niall turned to Dion. \"Cover him over with a sheet. Then have the body removedto the mortuary.\"He led them back inside again; they were all looking shaken. Simeon said: \"Doesanyone know what happened?\"\"Yes. He was killed by Skorbo.\" There were some angry murmurs. Niall said: \"Butit was understandable. He was responsible for Skorbo's death.\"That shocked them, as he had known it would. Someone said incredulously: \"A loneman killed a spider?\"\"There were three of them. It was an ingenious booby trap. They cut off thefronds of a young palm, then bent it down like a spring. As Skorbo approached,they cut the rope. . .\"There was no need to elaborate; Niall's words, reinforced by mental images,conveyed his meaning direct to their minds.Niall took the pendant on its gold chain from his pocket and handed it toBroadus. \"Has anyone seen this before?\"As it was passed around the table there was a shaking of heads.Simeon asked: \"It belonged to the dead man?\"Niall nodded. \"It is of ancient workmanship. No modem jeweler would have theskill to make this chain.\"\"Have you any ideas about that symbol on it?\"Simeon said slowly: \"In my younger days I was interested in the old science ofalchemy. This reminds me of a symbol of a bird of prey.\"\"Yes, of course.\" Now he looked more closely, Niall could see the resemblance.Corbin, a fat young man whose head was covered with tight blond curls said: \"Ihear that Skorbo was the most hated spider in the city.\" He spoke with a certaincomplacency.Niall said reprovingly: \"That may be true. But it doesn't help us to find outwho killed him.\"\"I'm certain it wasn't one of our people.\" The speaker was one of the captivesfrom Dira; his countrymen occupied one third of the seats on the Council.Niall said: \"You could be right, Massig. But someone in this city must knowsomething about it. I need the help of every one of you. You must all realizehow serious it is.\"Corbin asked: \"And what happens if we find them?\"\"We must hand them over for punishment.\"Massig asked: \"Couldn't we execute them ourselves? We are a legally constitutedauthority.\"Niall understood his objection. The spiders would devise the most horrible deaththat could be imagined.\"That is true. But we must also show that we possess a sense of justice.\" Helooked around at their faces, and could see that none of them was convinced.\"Listen to me. I used to wonder why the spiders hated men so much. I thought itwas because they were monsters. Then I found out the real reason: because theywere afraid of us. They regarded us as the monsters. They had to enslave usbecause they believed we threatened their existence. And nothing that hashappened since then has made them change their minds. Yet they agreed that thereshould be peace between the spiders and men. They agreed there should be no morekilling. And now it looks as if we have broken our side of the bargain. What ifthey decide that it is time to break theirs?\"In the silence that followed he could read their thoughts: the fear andconfusion and self-interest. They all enjoyed being on this Council, playing atbeing men of authority. Now they remembered what it was like to be slaves, andthe thought chilled them.Hastur, one of the beetle servants, asked: \"Do you think that might happen?\"\"Not at the moment.\" He could sense their relief. \"But it could happen. That iswhy we must show our good faith.\"Broadus asked: \"What can we do, sire?\"\"I want you to go back to your own people and find out what you can. Someonemust have seen these men. Perhaps someone spoke to them. They cannot haveentered the city unnoticed. If you learn anything, report back to meimmediately.\" He stood up. \"And now I think it is time to adjourn this meeting.\"All rose and made ritual obeisance. As they filed out of the room in silence,Niall beckoned to Simeon. When they were alone, he closed the door, then satdown at the table.\"Give me your advice.\"Simeon shook his head. \"What can I say? This is a bad business.\"\"But who do you think was responsible?\"Simeon frowned. \"It's baffling. We know it can't be one of your people -- theywouldn't have the courage or the enterprise. My people detest the spiders. Butthey've simply no reason to kill Skorbo. It would be an act of stupidity. Thatonly leaves the men of Dira. Plenty of them have reason to kill spiders. Some ofthem saw their relatives and friends murdered when the spiders overran the city.Some of them saw their children eaten. As far as I can see, they're the onlyones with a good reason for killing a spider.\"Niall shook his head. \"I don't think they were responsible.\"\"Why not?\"\"There's something I didn't mention. Dravig tore the palm tree out of theground. And in the roots there was a metal disc -- I think it was made of lead-- with a symbol on it: the same symbol as on the pendant. It seemed to me thatit must have been there at least a year.\"\"What makes you think it had been there so long?\"\"Because the roots had grown around it.\"Simeon stared at him with astonishment. \"You're saying that the tree wasspecially planted to kill Skorbo?\"\"Can you think of any other explanation?\"\"Isn't it more likely that it was put there later, to bring good luck to theirenterprise?\"\"It's possible. But I got the impression that it had been there since the treewas planted. And that must have been at least a year ago -- before Dira wascaptured by the spiders.\"Simeon shook his head; he was obviously perturbed. \"If you're right, thenthey've been planning this for a very long time.\"Niall nodded. \"That was my own thought.\"\"Then who the devil are they?\"\"Have you heard of human beings outside this city -- in other parts of thecountry?\"\"No.\" Simeon was silent for a long time. \"I suppose there are some, of course. Ionce heard rumors of people to the north -- people who are more like animals.But I never believed them.\"\"Why not?\"\"Because the spiders would have hunted them down.\"Niall had to agree that this sounded reasonable. In the days of slavery, spiderballoons had constantly patrolled all areas suspected of concealing humanfugitives.Simeon said: \"Could I see this lead disc?\"\"It disappeared.\"\"Disappeared?\"\"It was too heavy for my pocket, so I left it by the door. When I came back, ithad gone.\"\"So these men must have been hiding nearby?\"Niall shook his head. \"It was more likely one of the slaves. They were workingright outside the building.\"\"Did you question the overseer?\"\"He saw nothing.\"\"But why should a slave want a piece of lead?\"\"You know slaves. They'll steal anything.\"\"But you didn't have them searched?\"\"It hardly seemed worth the trouble.\" Yet now that he thought about it, he couldsee that Simeon was right.Simeon persisted. \"Look, if someone went to the trouble of stealing a heavypiece of lead, he must have had a reason. Even a slave wouldn't have much usefor a lump of lead. What if Skorbo's killers were among the slaves?\"Niall shrugged. \"It's possible. But they looked just like an ordinary squad ofslaves.\"\"Even so, I think we ought to go and check.\"\"Yes, I suppose you're right.\" Yet he stood up reluctantly, feeling that he wasgiving way merely to humor Simeon.Outside, the pale winter sky was cloudless, and the reflected sunlight waspainful to the eyes. At least the slaves had trampled a path through the snow,so walking was easier. The slaves were no longer in the square, but the wheelmarks of the cart that had been used to transport the dead man were clearlyvisible.The mortuary was situated in the same building as the newly founded medicalschool, three blocks south along the main avenue. As they reached the corner,they could see the slaves shambling in irregular formation beside the cart, notfar from their destination. They were hurrying after it when the cart halted;the body -- still covered by a trailing sheet -- was removed, placed on a plank,and carried into the building. The overseer was about to follow as Niall andSimeon arrived, breathless from their exertion. Niall called him back.\"Dion, I want you to line up all the slaves. Call the others from inside.\"The overseer saluted and shouted an order; a few moments later, the bodyreemerged from the building. It was on a single broad plank, and the arms andlegs hung down on either side. Niall ordered them to replace it on the cart.Then the slaves were ordered to stand in line along the road. Niall countedthem, then asked the overseer: \"How many should there be?\"\"Thirty, sir.\"\"Then why are there only twenty-nine?\"The overseer blinked with astonishment, and counted them slowly, pointing ateach one as he did so. He said: \"Yes, you're right.\" He turned to face thesquad. \"Attention!\" The slaves clicked their heels, and made a half-heartedattempt to look like soldiers. Dion said: \"Do any of you know what happened tothe other fellow?\"\"I do.\" The speaker was a hollow-chested man with a harelip who was standingnext to the cart. When he showed no sign of offering further information, Dionshouted impatiently: \"Well, where is he, you fool?\"The man raised his hand and silently pointed into the building. The overseercursed.\"I thought I told you all to come out.\" The man gazed back blankly with cowlikeindifference.Niall beckoned to Dion. \"You'd better come with us.\"Simeon said: \"Someone had better watch the rear of the building, in case hetries to escape that way.\"Niall had already been here several times. The ground floor had been convertedinto a casualty department and maternity ward. It smelled of the chlorinatedlime used as a disinfectant. This was a large building, and the man could havegone in one of many directions. As they stood, hesitating, Dion said: \"Ifnecessary I'll get a squad and search the whole place.\"Niall pointed. \"Look, he went up there.\" He had noticed a fragment of meltingsnow on one of the stairs.They climbed the stairs quietly, so as not to forewarn their quarry. The nextfloor was in the process of being converted into a ward, and they could hearcarpenters sawing wood from behind a closed door; it seemed unlikely the man hadgone that way. Niall led the way up the next flight. This part of the buildingwas still in its original state, and the floor had not even been swept; it wascovered with plaster that had fallen from the walls and ceiling, and with brokenglass and fragments of lath. A glance at the floor of the corridor told Niallthat no one had been this way recently; but the overseer was already flingingopen doors and peering into empty rooms. Niall swore under his breath; the manthey were seeking must have heard the noise.\"He may be heading for the roof. Could he get into the next building?\"\"Probably.\" Simeon opened the nearest door; through the broken window of theempty room, they could see that the building next door was less than six feetaway -- a distance posing no problem to an agile man.\"We'd better hurry.\"Simeon laid a hand on his arm. \"Careful. There's a spider living in the roofspace. It might jump on us and ask questions later.\"His caution was justified; although spiders were now forbidden to attack humanbeings, the invasion of its personal territory might be regarded as extremeprovocation. \"A death spider?\"\"No, a pink glue spider.\" This was the name given to spiders of the speciesoonopidae, generally regarded as harmless, since they were smaller than thedeath spiders and had no poisonous sting. But they were many times stronger andswifter than any man, and their tarsal claws were powerful enough to sever anarm.Niall mounted the stair softly and cautiously and, as he reached the top step,suddenly found himself face to face with the glue spider. It had obviously cometo investigate the noise. For a moment, both were equally startled; itsimmediate reaction was to immobilize him with a concentrated burst of willpower. Niall felt exactly as if his whole body had been frozen in a block ofice, so that he was unable to move a muscle. Six months earlier, he would havefound such an experience terrifying; now he had become so accustomed to spidersthat it hardly caused his heartbeat to accelerate. His passivity and lack offear convinced the spider that he was harmless, and it released him almostimmediately.Niall had never seen a glue spider at close quarters, and he was struck by thebeauty of its coloring; its body, legs, and head were all of the same flesh pinkcolor, like the cheeks of a healthy country girl. But unlike the wolf spiders ordeath spiders, whose chelicerae resembled tufts of beard, the face of the gluespider entirely lacked the slightest touch of humanity. The great dome of ahead, not unlike that of a bald-headed man, surmounted the smooth pinkchelicerae with their unfolded fangs; the six eyes were in two rows, with fourabove and two below, and the end eyes of the upper row were turned outward;since they were also pink, they looked like glass globes rather than eyes. Thecreature seemed as alien as a Martian.Yet perhaps because it seemed so totally nonhuman, perhaps because of its warmcoloring, Niall felt that he had nothing to fear. He addressed the spidertelepathically, also speaking the words aloud.\"We are looking for a man. Have you seen him?\"The spider seemed startled. It shifted uncomfortably on its feet but made noreply. The bulblike eyes -- on a level with Niall's own, since the spider wasless than six feet high -- seemed blank. Niall repeated the question -- thistime trying to transmit the image of a man -- but there was still no reply. Hestepped forward cautiously; the spider stepped back and then moved aside. Niallbeckoned to Simeon and Dion to follow him.He attempted to place himself in the mind of the fugitive. If he had arrived atthe top of the stairs, and found that he could go no further, what would he do?This floor, like the others, consisted of a corridor with rooms on either side.The rooms on the right side overlooked the narrow side street, and through thenearest open door, Niall could see the web of the glue spider stretching acrossthe street to the house opposite. The fugitive had almost certainly noticed thisbefore he entered the building, so it was unlikely that he had gone to theright.And if a man knew there was a spider in one of the rooms on the right, he wouldmove to the left, probably on tiptoe. Niall looked carefully at the dust andrubble on the floor, mixed with the wings and carapaces of dead flyingcreatures, and saw what he was looking for. The marks would have beenunnoticeable to anyone who was not looking for them, mere disturbances of theplaster and debris. The man had, as Niall suspected, been walking on tiptoe, andthe slight signs were repeated at regular intervals of about eighteen inches --a man on tiptoe takes smaller steps than a man walking normally. In front of thefirst door on the left, there was a clear footmark where the man had paused toopen the door. Niall did the same, and found himself looking into an empty roomwith unbroken windows. There was no place of concealment, and this was clearlywhy the man had continued on tiptoe to the next door. It was unnecessary to openthis, for the marks continued on along the corridor, sometimes becominginvisible where there was no dust or rubble, but also resuming further on.Outside the third door the traces ceased; there was no sign of disturbancefurther along the corridor. Niall raised his hand to halt the others; his heartwas beating violently. Cautiously, he turned the handle and pushed open thedoor. To his disappointment, the room was empty. But its cracked window had beenraised. He hurried across the room and peered out. An ornamental ledge ran underthe window along the whole length of the building; it was only six inches wide,but would present no problems for an agile -- or desperate -- man. What puzzledNiall was that there was no accessible window in the building across thealleyway, only a blank wall; to achieve access to such a window, the fugitivewould have to move twelve feet along the ledge in the direction of the mainavenue. And the window opposite this spot was closed and unbroken. Thealternative, it seemed, was to go in the opposite direction, and around thecorner at the rear of the building. And looking down at the ground four storiesbelow, Niall had to admit that only desperation could have induced him to makesuch an attempt.Simeon said: \"What about the next room?\"Niall shook his head. \"The footprints stopped outside this one. Wait . . .\"Hestooped and examined the floor. His nerves tensed as he realized that the signsshowed that the man had gone back across the room -- back toward the corner,where there was another door. It looked like an inbuilt closet or cupboard. Helooked toward it, and the others understood his meaning. Niall tiptoed towardit, and noticed that it had been left open a crack; the man inside had evidentlybeen unable to close it completely. But while he was still several feet away,the door burst open, and a man darted out and ran to the open door of the room.He was so quick that they were all taken by surprise. Niall was the first torecover; he gave a cry and ran in pursuit. The man was already halfway down thecorridor, but his run was heavy and awkward, and Niall had always been fleet offoot. Within a few strides, Niall had gained on him, and seized the shoulder ofhis slave tunic. The man swerved and stumbled, crashing to the wall. For amoment, Niall gazed into his eyes. They were large eyes, and seemed very darkand piercing. But as Niall prepared to grapple, he experienced a sensation thatmade him drop to his knees. It was exactly as if someone had struck himviolently in the face, and at the same time gripped his windpipe to cut off hisbreathing. For a moment everything became dark, although he had the confusedimpression that time had gone into slow motion, and that his arms and legs werealso moving in slow motion, like those of a swimmer. It was like beinghalf-awake and half-asleep.When his vision cleared, he saw that the man was now lying on the floor, helddown by the front legs of the glue spider. His face and hands were covered insome shiny substance, and as Niall watched, the spider squirted more from itschelicerae. It was some kind of transparent glue, and as it struck the man'sface, he suddenly ceased to struggle, collapsing as if dead.Niall dragged himself to his feet, helped by Simeon. He was feeling oddly sickand dizzy. He looked at the spider, and transmitted a message of thanks. Thespider released its victim. But as soon as it did so, the man twisted sidewaysand jumped to his feet -- it was evident that he had been shamming. His handdarted into his bosom, and emerged with a knife in a sheath. As he pulled offthe sheath and dropped it to the floor, his eyes met Niall's in a smile oftriumph. There was something animal-like in the way the lips revealed his yellowteeth. He raised the knife, and Niall shrank back, expecting to be attacked.Instead, to his astonishment, the man slashed at his own forearm, making asuperficial cut. Then, as the spider again seized him from behind, he sagged tohis knees and collapsed onto the floor. This time it was obvious that he was notshamming.Simeon knelt beside him and twisted his face sideways by grabbing his hair. Theman's eyes were closed, and the glue on his face was already hardening into amask. Simeon took his wrist and felt his pulse.\"He's dead. Don't touch that!\" This last was shouted at Niall as he bent forwardto look at the knife. But Niall had no intention of trying to pick it up. Whatinterested him was the symbol burned into the wooden handle of the knife, thesame symbol he had already seen on the leaden disc.The spider was retreating along the corridor. Then it reached up, and its tarsalclaws gripped the edge of a hole in the ceiling. A moment later, it had pulleditself upward and heaved its body through the trapdoor. Its abdomen seemed toolarge, and stuck for a moment; then it disappeared.Simeon asked: \"Are you all right?\"\"Yes.\" But Niall staggered as he said so, and almost lost his balance.\"What did he do?\"\"I don't know.\" He was feeling sick again, and had no desire to answerquestions. He turned to the overseer. \"Please go to the headquarters of theSpider Lord and ask Dravig to come here.\" When the man looked alarmed, Niallturned to Simeon, whose face seemed oddly distorted, as if seen through water.\"Would you mind going too? They'd pay more attention to you.\"Before they were out of sight, Niall sat on the floor, his back propped againstthe wall. Waves of heat were rising to his forehead, and he could feel himselfbreaking out into perspiration. After a few moments, the nausea retreated again.He was breathing heavily, through his mouth, and his body felt drained ofstrength. But after resting for five minutes, a feeling of normality began toreturn. He opened his eyes, and looked at the dead man, whose face was turnedupwards toward the ceiling. It was easy to see how he had succeeded inmasquerading as a slave; he had a beaklike nose, large ears, and a receding chin-- only the abnormally pale face distinguished him from other slaves. But Niallrecalled the strange glance of those dark eyes, and realized that he had beendealing with a man of intelligence. He had also been dealing with a man offormidable resolve; his instantaneous suicide proved that.And he had, he now realized, been dealing with an alien, a man who was a nativeneither of this country nor of Dira. The proof was that the man had somehowlearned the spiders' trick of striking direct at his will power. Yet there wasan obvious difference. When the pink glue spider had paralyzed him at the top ofthe stairs, it had somehow paralyzed his nervous system, so that he was fullyconscious, yet unable to move a muscle. This man had used some direct, brutalpsychic force, like a blow with a blunt instrument. It had left him feeling sickand weak, while the momentary paralysis of the spider had had no aftereffect.The difference was obviously that the spider intended only to stop him frommoving; the man had intended to hurt him.As he stared at the masklike face of the corpse, he experienced a strangesensation that sent cold waves through his scalp; for a moment, he was convincedthat the man was still alive. It took him some moments to understand what hadhappened. His sense of bafflement had led him to make an attempt to probe themind of the corpse. It was a purely automatic reflex, for he knew the man wasdead. The result should have been totally negative, like stirring a dead bodywith his foot. Yet he had encountered an eerie sense of warmth and vitality.There was some sense in which the body was still alive and yet unconscious, likea plant or vegetable. Niall allowed his mind to become blank, and tried again.This time, he experienced a reflex of disgust which made him instantly withdraw,as if he had touched something unpleasant and slimy. There was something aboutthe lingering life-field of the dead man that repelled him like an unpleasantsmell. It was something as distinct as a smell, and therefore inexpressible inwords. He had occasionally encountered it in the desert, in the minds ofpredators -- for example, in the nightmare creature called a saga insect, whichhad held a cricket in its claws and then crunched its way down its body as ifeating a stick of celery. And he could still remember the revulsion heexperienced on accidentally catching a glimpse into the soul of some demonic,batlike creature in the Delta; it had seemed to be entirely malevolent, as ifconsumed by the desire to kill.The sound of footsteps brought him back to the present. It was Simeon, followedby Dravig. Niall started to rise to his feet, then thought better of it as thewaves of nausea rose to his head. He sank down again, his back against the wall.\"Hello, Dravig. I'm sorry to bring you here.\"\"Are you hurt?\" Niall was flattered by the genuine concern in the spider'squery.\"No, I'll be all right.\"Dravig looked at the corpse. \"Who is this man?\"\"One of Skorbo's assassins.\"\"You have done well. Where is the third?\"\"I don't know. But now we know why they removed all the clothes of the dead man.He must have been dressed in a slave uniform, and they didn't want us to know hewas hiding among slaves. I think it might be worth searching the slave quarter.\"\"I will give the order. How did this man die?\"\"He killed himself with that knife. Be careful.\" The spider had picked it up inhis tarsal claw, and raised it toward his face. \"It's poisoned.\"\"Yes. It is the venom of the green rock scorpion, perhaps the deadliest poisonon earth.\" The spider's sense of smell was far more acute than that of a humanbeing. \"It is fatal even for spiders.\"\"Then you should warn the searchers to be careful. The other may be armed withone too.\"The spider signified affirmation; the mental gesture was independent of words,like a nod. He asked: \"Do you need help?\"\"No, thank you. Simeon will help me.\"\"Then I must return to make my report.\" He drew himself up, as if standing toattention, and said formally: \"In the name of the Spider Lord I thank you forhunting down this assassin.\" Niall understood enough of the spider mentality toknow what he was trying to convey: that he accepted that the human beings ofthis city were in no way responsible for Skorbo's death.Niall inclined his head. \"Thank you.\"When Dravig had gone, Simeon picked up the knife, and carefully replaced it inits sheath. \"I'll get this analyzed. The poison must be deadly.\" He had beenunable to hear Dravig's side of the conversation.\"It is the venom of the green rock scorpion.\"\"Great goddess!\" Simeon almost dropped the knife. \"If I'd known that I'd havepicked it up with gloves.\" He took a large handkerchief from his pocket andcarefully wrapped the sheath, tying the corners in a knot.Niall pushed himself cautiously to his feet, and was relieved to find that he nolonger felt dizzy; but the feeling of tiredness remained. Simeon looked at hisface with concern.\"You're very pale. Did he hit you in the stomach?\"Niall shook his head. \"He struck at me with his will-force, like a spider.\"Simeon stared incredulously. \"Are you sure of that?\"\"Quite certain.\"\"He didn't touch you physically?\"\"No.\"Simeon absorbed this in silence. He looked down at the body, shaking his head.\"Then who the devil could he be?\"He dropped on his knees beside the body and searched the pockets. They yieldedonly a soiled handkerchief of coarse linen, and a wooden spoon and fork --slaves carried their own eating utensils.Niall said: \"Look around his neck.\" There was, as he expected, a fine gold chainwith a pendant.Simeon removed it and held it out to Niall. \"Do you want it?\"\"No. I already have one.\"But this was not the real reason he refused to take it. He felt a curiousintuitive revulsion, a feeling that the pendant was somehow unclean. Before he was halfway down the avenue, Niall realized it had been a mistake towalk. Every muscle in his body ached, and his feet felt as if they were made oflead. In spite of the sunlight, the cold air made him shiver. He brushed thesnow from a low wall and sat down.A few hundred yards away, in the center of the square, the white tower sparkledin the sunlight; its purity made even the surrounding snow look gray. As hestared at it, framed against the pale blue sky, Niall felt again the sensationhe had experienced the first time he saw it: the curious spark of pure joy. Heand his family had been prisoners of the spiders, and they had looked down onthis city from a hilltop to the south. Some intuition had told him that thewhite tower represented freedom and hope. Now, as he looked at it, the surge ofdelight caused the exhaustion to vanish, and he realized that his mind had beenincreasing the fatigue by paying attention to it.The tower stood in the midst of a square space of green lawn, now invisibleunder the snow. Even in the days of slavery, the spiders had allowed their humancaptives to trim the grass and keep it free from weeds. They had detested thetower, as a symbol of past human supremacy; they had even attempted to destroyit. Yet they had respected it as a mystery beyond their understanding.In fact, the tower was virtually indestructible. What looked likesemitranslucent white crystal was, in fact, an atomic force field, made to looksolid by causing it to reflect the light; it rejected solid matter in exactlythe same way that the pole of a magnet rejects the like-pole of another magnet.In the course of about a million years, the force field would drain away and thetower would collapse. In the meantime, it would continue to serve as a timecapsule, a giant electronic brain whose memory cells stored the accumulatedknowledge of the men who had once been the sole masters of the earth.Now that he had regained his breath, Niall stood up and walked on toward thetower. The men and women who passed him hardly gave him a second glance; in hislong cloak, with the fur-lined hood, he was indistinguishable from most of them.It was a relief not to have to return their salutations. During his early daysas the ruler of this city, they had prostrated themselves on the ground andremained in that position until he had gone past. He had tried issuing aproclamation that he wanted to be ignored, but it had made no difference; theidea of ignoring their king shocked them profoundly. So Niall had issued asecond proclamation, declaring that he preferred to be saluted with a bow. Thistime the citizens had obeyed him, but sometimes they bowed so deeply that theyfell over, and Niall felt obliged to go and help them up. On the whole, hegreatly preferred to be ignored.The snow that covered the lawn around the tower was free from footprints.Although there was no law forbidding citizens to walk on the grass, no one everdid so, even to take a shortcut; the tower seemed to inspire feelingsapproaching religious awe.The white tower was thirty feet in diameter at its base, and about two hundredfeet high. Yet as he looked up, it seemed to stretch as high as the clouds. Thiswas an optical illusion, due to some quality in its milky surface, which seemedto shimmer like the air above a hot road; Niall had once compared it to liquidmoonlight. As he approached within a few inches, he experienced the familiartingling sensation throughout his body, the sensation a water divinerexperiences as he stands above an underground stream. He felt as if he was beingpulled forward by a magnet. The sensation became stronger as he made his wayaround to the north side of the tower, where he knew its vibrations wereprecisely attuned to those of his own body. There the pull became irresistible,and he moved forward. As his body encountered the surface, there was a sensationlike walking into water. He experienced a momentary dizziness, a loss oforientation, as if he was on the point of fainting or falling asleep, andeverything became dark. Then it grew light again and he stepped inside thetower.Yet what faced him now was not the circular room he had anticipated, but abreathtaking panorama of snow-clad mountain peaks, ice-covered ridges, and mistyblue valleys, stretching out in all directions for what seemed hundreds ofmiles. Clouds rested like feathery pillows in some of the glaciated valleys, butthe clouds above his head looked as jagged and broken as the granite ridges andslopes far below. He was standing on a mountaintop on hard-packed snow, and theair was so clear that it seemed to sparkle. Less than six feet in front of himthere was a sheer drop into a valley that must have been at least a mile deep;to his right, a sloping ridge like a snow-covered rocky spine ran down toanother peak far below.Niall was startled, but not deceived. He knew that the scene spread out beforehim was an illusion. The first time he had entered the white tower, he had foundhimself standing on a sandy beach, facing a line of steep cliffs; that had alsobeen a panoramic hologram, a film projected into three-dimensional space toproduce an illusion of solid reality. Even the cold wind that now blew againsthis face was an illusion created by electronic technology; a stream of chargedparticles bombarded his nerve ends, creating an illusion of moving air. Yeteverything looked so completely real that it was impossible to detect thedeception.He rubbed his feet on the hard snow; it felt exactly like the snow he had leftbehind outside. But as soon as he closed his eyes he was aware that he wasstanding on a smooth wooden floor. He took three steps forward, so he wasstanding on the edge of the sheer drop. Intellectually, he knew he was stillstanding on the hard floor. Yet when he tried to force himself to take anadditional step into the void, his feet refused to obey him, and he experienceda rush of fear that almost took his breath away. He could see the worn graniteface of the great slope opposite, with its snow-filled crevasses and razorlikeedges, in the most precise detail. Yet as soon as he closed his eyes it allvanished -- even the cold wind -- and he knew that he was on a solid floor.He walked two steps forward, then opened his eyes. He was suspended in midair,looking down at the striated rock face a mile below, and on the cloud-filledvalley floor. It was like floating on a magic carpet. He went on walking, nowintellectually confident, while his emotions continued to sound frantic alarmbells and to flood his bloodstream with adrenaline. A few steps further, andthey gradually became calm, leaving him suddenly relaxed and triumphant.At that point the mountain landscape disappeared with the abruptness of abursting bubble, and he found himself in the familiar room, with its curvedwhite walls and luminous white ceiling. In its center there was a marble-coloredcolumn, more than three feet in diameter, stretching from floor to ceiling; ithad the same texture as the outer walls of the tower, but seemed even moreunstable, as if made of a kind of gray liquid smoke, which flowed as if it werealive. When Niall stepped forward into the surface, it admitted him, and hefound himself surrounded by a white odorless fog. As if his body had suddenlybecome weightless, he was floating upward; it was such a pleasant sensation thathe would have liked it to last for hours. But a few moments later he stoppedwith a slight jerk. A single step forward, and he was standing on a flat roof,with a pale blue sky overhead, and the panorama of the spider city stretchedaround him -- the view with which he had become so familiar from the roof of hispalace.This was not, in fact, a flat roof, but a room consisting of a force field inthe shape of a glass dome. But a glass pane is visible because it hasaccumulated a layer of dust; the force field, being uncontaminated by dust, wasvirtually invisible.This room was comfortably furnished; tubular metal furniture was covered with ablack, leatherlike material that was warm and yielding to the touch; the thickblack carpet was as soft as spring grass. The only unusual item was the tallblack box that stood against the southern wall, with its sloping panel of opaqueglass and row of control knobs. This was the Steegmaster, the creation ofTorwald Steeg, which was responsible for this tower and almost everything in it.Standing beside the Steegmaster, staring out over the square, stood a man in agray suit. The tall figure was slim and upright; only the white hair betrayedthat he was old.He asked: \"Did you recognize it?\"\"It was the Himalayas, wasn't it?\"\"Your geography is improving. You were standing on the summit of Mount Everest,looking south toward Nepal. The summit in the distance was Kanchenjunga.\"It was a game they played every time Niall came to the white tower. Yesterday ithad been the South Pole; two days before that, the crater of Mount Etna in fulleruption. Niall had guessed wrong both times.He went and joined the old man by the window, and was surprised to see that thesquare was no longer empty. In the few minutes since he had entered the tower, alarge contingent of men had formed ranks outside the headquarters of the SpiderLord; there must have been at least a hundred of them. As he watched they werejoined by another squad who marched out of a side street. At an order from oneof the black-clad commanders, all stood to attention. A moment later, the doubledoors of the headquarters building opened, and death spiders and wolf spidersbegan to emerge. They were marching in single file, and Mail recognized thespider at the head of the column as Dravig. They crossed the western side of thesquare and moved north toward the river; the slave quarter lay on its furtherbank. As the spiders continued to pour out of the building, Niall found it hardto believe that it could have held so many. By the time the doors closed, theremust have been at least three hundred spiders on the march. The men, with twocommanders at their head, marched behind them.Niall asked his companion: \"Do you know what is happening?\"\"I assume this is connected with the death of the spider?\"\"Do you know who killed him?\"The old man shook his head. \"You overestimate the powers of the Steegmaster. Itspurpose is merely to gather and correlate information.\"It was true that Niall had only the vaguest idea of the capacities orlimitations of the Steegmaster; wishful thinking inclined him to regard it as anall-knowing intelligence.\"But you knew about the death of the spider?\"\"Naturally, since it took place only a hundred yards away.\"\"But you've no idea who might have killed him?\"\"I would like to help you. But I lack the information to assess theprobabilities.\"\"I thought the Steegmaster could read minds.\"The old man said patiently: \"Not minds. Thoughts. That is an entirely differentmatter. A thought-reading machine can decipher the information stored in thememory circuits of the brain, but it operates best when the person is asleep. Itis almost impossible to read the thoughts of someone who is awake because themental processes are too complex, and most of them operate on a subconsciouslevel. The Steegmaster has no power to read feelings and intuitions, whichoperate on frequencies far beyond its range. To work efficiently, theSteegmaster requires specific information.\"Niall took from his pocket the pendant on its gold chain. He held it out on hispalm, with the symbol uppermost. \"How about this? Can you tell me anything aboutit?\"The old man studied it for a moment. \"I would say that it is a magical sigil.\"\"Sigil?\" Niall had never heard the word.\"A type of symbol used in magic or alchemy.\"\"But what does it mean?\"The old man smiled at him. \"Let us see if we can find out.\" As he finishedspeaking, he vanished. And since he had been forewarned by the smile, Niallaccepted the disappearance without surprise. Throughout their conversation, hehad been aware that he was actually speaking to the computer that stood betweenthem. Like the mountain range that had confronted him on entering the tower, theold man was a computer-created hologram; this was why Niall sometimes addressedhim by the name of his creator, the twenty-third-century scientist TorwaldSteeg. Niall was also aware of his purpose in disappearing, rather than leavingthe room in the normal manner. Steeg's aim was to teach him a new set ofreflexes and reactions; it was an attempt to make him trust his reason ratherthan his senses.Now reason told him the old man would be found in the library. He stepped againinto the column in the center of the room. As the mist surrounded him, he againexperienced the sensation of weightlessness; his body seemed to be a featherdrifting gently into a gulf. When the slight jerk told him that the descent hadceased, he stepped out of the column. Of all the rooms in the tower, the librarywas Niall's favorite; he loved to breathe its smell of dust, old parchment, andleather-bound books. To refer to it as an illusion would have struck him as akind of blasphemy. The library, was, admittedly, a creation of the Steegmaster;but a creation of such complexity was in some way more real than mere physicalreality. After all, what was reality but a force field of subatomic energies?The library was a vast hexagonal room, about fifty yards wide, and so high thatits domed ceiling was almost invisible. The walls were lined with bookshelvesand with wrought-iron galleries that encircled the room; Niall had once countedthem and discovered that there were precisely a hundred. Between these galleriesran black iron stairways whose steps, like the galleries themselves, had afretwork design based on a motif of leaves and petals. On either side of thelibrary, an old-fashioned cagelike elevator ran up to the topmost gallery.These shelves, according to the gold plate above the door, contained copies ofevery book in the world, a total of 30,819,731 volumes. Every book had beenphotographed page by page and stored in the memory of the computer -- a projectthat had taken an army of scholars more than fifty years. The undertaking hadbeen inspired by the notion of the twentieth-century writer H. G. Wells, who hadadvocated the creation of an encyclopedia encompassing the whole range of humanknowledge. This library was even more ambitious than Wells's \"world brain\"; itcontained, quite simply, every idea that man had ever committed to print.The design of the room had been based upon a combination of the Reading Room ofthe British Museum, the Bibliothèque Nationale, and the Vatican Library. Thecenter of the library was occupied by a large circular desk, staffed bylibrarians; from this, like spokes in a wheel, radiated blue leather-coveredtables illuminated by reading lamps. Niall had never discovered the identitiesof the people who sat at these tables and trod softly around the galleries; heliked to believe that they were real men and women of the twenty-third century,whose identities had been captured and preserved by the miraculous technology ofTorwald Steeg.The old man was standing at the central desk, talking to one of the librarians;now he turned and beckoned to Niall, pointing to the nearest elevator. Nialljoined him as he was pulling aside the creaking concertina of a door, andfollowed him into the wood-paneled interior, whose rear wall bore the notice:\"Maximum load three persons.\" The old man touched a button; nothing happened. Heopened and closed the concertina door again; this time, the elevator began torise slowly, with a soft, whining sound. Niall had no idea how all this wasaccomplished, and no desire to know; he preferred to bask in the illusion thathe had been transported back into an earlier century.They stepped out at the twenty-eighth level -- each level had its number cast inthe ironwork of the front of the balcony. These galleries made Niall nervous,since the fretwork made it possible to see through the floor and the sides ofthe balcony, which were scarcely three feet high. He knew it was impossible tofall, yet would have felt more comfortable if the floor and wall had been solid.As he followed Steeg along the gallery, Niall observed that many of the titlesof the books were in Latin: Turba Philosophorum, Speculum Alchamiae, De OccultaPhilosophia, Aureum Vellus; others were in Greek or Arabic. They halted before ashelf whose metal-engraved label read: Hermetica, KU to LO.\"What's hermetica?\"\"Magical studies, named after the legendary founder of magic, HermesTrismegistos -- Thrice Great Hermes.\" He reached up to the shelf and removed,with some effort, a large volume bound in black leather; Niall had time to readits title: Encyclopedia of Hermetic and Alchemical Sigils, before it was placedon one of the tables that stood in each angle of the hexagonal gallery. Thebook's edges were uncut, and the handmade paper was thick and unglazed.The old man clearly knew what he was looking for; he quickly located a pagetoward the end of the volume. \"I think this is what you are looking for.\"The symbol on which he had placed his finger was unmistakably the same as theone on the pendant, in spite of some slight variations in shape. [0002.jpg] Niall bent forward eagerly, then looked up, his face wrinkled in disappointment.\"What language is that?\"\"German.\"\"And what does 'rache' mean?\"\"Revenge. The text says that this is a sigil dating from the thirteenth century,representing revenge. The lower part represents the wings of a bird of prey. Theupper part represents the horns of der teufel, the devil. The bird of prey iswinging toward its prey, carrying a terrible vengeance on its back.\"As Niall stared at it, he felt a crawling sensation in the nerves of his scalp,as if someone had poured cold water over his head; it was like a premonition ofdanger. He examined the sigil intently, as if he could force it to give up itssecret. \"Does it say whether this was a famous symbol?\"\"It doesn't, but the answer is almost certainly no. A symbol like this would beknown only to students of hermeticism.\"\"Then how do you suppose Skorbo's killers knew about it?\"\"That is something I cannot answer.\" He replaced the book on the shelf. \"Perhapsthey were students of magic.\"As he followed Steeg back toward the elevator, Niall experienced a deep sense offrustration. It seemed absurd to be surrounded by so much knowledge, and yet tobe baffled by a simple question.\"Why should anyone want to study magic?\"\"Because it is far older than natural science.\"\"Yes, but. . . but surely it's just a kind of superstition?\"\"That is what most people believed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.But in the twenty-first century, many anthropologists came to a differentconclusion. They studied primitive tribes and concluded that some of them wereable to perform certain feats of magic -- rainmaking, for example.\"Niall shook his head. \"Do you believe that?\"The old man smiled apologetically. \"I do not believe or disbelieve. I am merelya machine. But Torwald Steeg was a rationalist, and he refused to believe it.\"As they stepped into the elevator, Niall asked: \"And how is magic supposed towork?\"\"All primitive peoples say the same thing -- that magic is performed with thehelp of spirits.\"\"But spirits don't exist, do they?\"The old man smiled. \"Torwald Steeg certainly did not think so.\"The sensation of descending brought a return of the feeling of nausea; waves ofheat seemed to be rising from his stomach. Niall pulled a folding seat out ofthe wall and sat down.\"Are you feeling ill?\"\"Just tired.\" Niall closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the wall.\"One of Skorbo's killers struck me with his will-force, like a spider.\"\"Although he was, in fact, a human being?\"Niall controlled his impatience. \"Of course.\"\"I see.\" It was at times like this that it was obvious that the old man was amachine; he had no power to register astonishment. \"In that case, I have asuggestion that might help.\"The elevator rattled to a halt. As they stepped out, the old man politely heldthe door for a middle-aged woman in a tweed skirt; she gave them a tight smileas she stepped past them. In response to the silence around them, Niallautomatically lowered his voice.\"Suggestion?\"The old man waited until they were outside before he spoke. \"If your mind hasbeen in contact with the mind of the killer, then he has left us a clue to hisidentity.\"\"How?\"\"Every event is bound to leave a trace -- that is one of the basic principles ofscience. And it applies to mental as well as physical events.\"Niall shook his head in bewilderment. \"But how could you see a mental trace. . .?\"\"It can be done -- with the aid of the peace machine.\" Again Niall's scalptingled, but this time with pleasurable excitement. It was the sensation heexperienced every time he approached the tower, the excitement a child feelswhen he hears the words \"Once upon a time. . .\"His expression must have betrayed his feelings. The old man said: \"Do not be toohopeful. The art of self-reflection is difficult and dangerous. But you willhave to learn sooner or later. Come.\"This time the old man led the way into the column. A few seconds later, theystepped into the hall of the peace machine.This room was another of the Steegmaster's magical creations. Like the library,it was far too large to be accommodated in the tower. It was a broad gallery,about a hundred feet long, whose walls were covered with a rich brocade of blueand gold. At regular intervals there were pedestals with busts and statues. Butthe city Niall could see through its round-arched windows was not the spidercity; to begin with, it was bathed in a sunlight so dazzling that waves of heatshimmered over its houses. The square outside contained a market, whose stallswere covered with bright-colored canopies, and the people who crowded betweenthem were also dressed in bright garments; many of them carried swords. The citywas surrounded by turreted walls, and beyond these there were green hills withterraces and vineyards.But Niall was now so familiar with this panorama of fifteenth-century Florencethat he paid it little attention. His eyes were fixed on the machine ofblue-colored metal that stood in the center of the gallery. This consisted of abed or couch above which was suspended a blue metal canopy whose lower face wascovered with frosted glass. Even to look at it made Niall feel serene andrelaxed. This was the peace machine, invented in the mid-twenty-first century byOswald Chater and Min Takahashi, and capable of inducing a state of consciouslycontrolled relaxation equivalent to dreamless sleep.But as he was about to climb onto the couch, the old man raised his hand.\"Wait. Before you do that it is important for you to understand the principlesof controlled self-reflection. Please sit down.\" He pointed to a bench that ranbetween the busts of Aristotle and Voltaire. \"To enter the state withoutpreparation could be highly dangerous.\"You know that the first thought-reading machine was invented in the early 2090sby a team at the University of Albuquerque, led by W. S. K. Sawyer. It wasSawyer who discovered that habit-memories have a molecular structure similar tothat of DNA, and that an electric current can cause them to discharge. When youtry to remember something without success, this is because you are too tired tocause the memory molecule to discharge.\"One day, an assistant of Sawyer's named Carl Meiklejohn was amplifying thememory circuits of an albino rat, and feeding them through to his own temporalcortex by means of electrodes implanted in his scalp. Suddenly, he discoveredthat the rat had formed a strong attachment to a pretty lab assistant namedAnnette Larsen. Now it so happened that Meiklejohn himself was in love withAnnette, but had been too shy to show his feelings. So he naturally enjoyedstudying the rat's feelings toward her. In fact, he enjoyed it so much that hebegan to make a habit of staying behind in the laboratory so he could play thememory circuits over and over again. One evening, when he was very tired, hefell into a half-sleep as he was playing the memory circuits. And in this state,he seemed to receive a strong impression that the girl was just as interested inhim as he was in her. When he returned to his normal waking state, he wasinclined to believe that he had been dreaming. But he had also noticed somethingelse while he was half-asleep: that the girl had a circular patch of brown skinon her neck between her shoulder blades. The following day, he walked up behindher when she was peering down a microscope, and saw that she had a patch ofbrown skin precisely where he had seen it the night before. This so impressedhim that he asked the girl to go out to dinner with him. She accepted, and thatnight they became engaged.\"Now Meiklejohn thought a great deal about this experience. He asked the girl ifshe had ever allowed the rat to walk over her shoulders and the back of herneck; she said of course not. In fact, she had seldom taken it out of its cage.So how could the rat's memory contain the knowledge of the patch of brown skin?Now Meiklejohn reached an important conclusion. He recalled that the rat'smemory had also told him that Annette was interested in him, and that this hadproved to be true. So was it possible that the rat's memory contained far morethan mere physical impressions of the girl: that because it was attached to her,it had somehow read her mind? And Meiklejohn, in turn, had read the rat's mindwhen he was half-asleep, and therefore in a state of deep relaxation.\"These conclusions were, of course, revolutionary. For it meant that a rat'smemory is capable of recording impressions of remarkable complexity --impressions too complex for the rat itself to understand. And that, moreover,Meiklejohn in his waking state was unable to grasp these complex impressions. Hehad to be totally relaxed and on the edge of sleep.\"Now Meiklejohn realized that he had made a discovery of tremendous importance,and that it would probably win him the Nobel Prize. So he decided to keep hisdiscovery a secret until he had conducted some further experiments. And thisproved to be a mistake. One morning, he was found wandering around theuniversity building wearing nothing but his shirt, and in a state of psychoticanxiety. Attendants from a local mental hospital had to put him in astraitjacket. Under heavy sedation he eventually recovered, and told them whathad happened. He had made recordings from the memory circuits of a stray dog.And the dog had belonged to an alcoholic who had treated it with extreme crueltybefore he went insane. In a state of deep relaxation -- Meiklejohn had beenusing the peace machine -- he had played back the dog's memory circuits, and hadbeen so shocked that he had an instant nervous breakdown.\"The story has a happy ending. Meiklejohn married Annette Larsen, and made acomplete recovery; he also received the Nobel Prize. And he went on to invent adevice for recording and amplifying memories which he called the psychoscope --a kind of telescope for looking into the mind. It became known to the generalpublic as the internalizer. And the psychoscope led him to an even moreimportant discovery: that he was able to study his own memories, and observe allkinds of complex impressions that he was not even aware of having received. Forexample, he discovered that Annette was pregnant at a time when neither of themhad even thought of the possibility.\"Cheap forms of the internalizer became immensely popular toward the end of thetwenty-first century -- people love to play with their own minds. But it causedso many nervous breakdowns, and so many cases of violent crime, that governmentsfinally banned its sale, and made private possession of internalizers illegal.\"Niall said: \"But how could it tell me anything about Skorbo's killer? I only sawhim alive for about half a minute.\"\"Your minds came into contact. That is enough. But before you try exploringthese memory impressions, I would advise you to experiment with a few simplepictures.\"Niall found it hard to conceal his excitement. What he had just heard seemed toopen up almost unimaginable vistas of possibility. There was nothing to preventhim from exploring his own past like a picture gallery, from reliving thebrightest moments of his childhood, or the excitement of his first visit to theunderground city of Dira. His heart was beating almost painfully as he stood upand went to the peace machine.\"Where is this internalizer?\"\"There is one already built into the peace machine.\"Niall climbed onto the bed, and lay down under the frosted glass; the yieldingvelvet surface was as soft as eiderdown. A light came on behind the frostedglass, and there was a faint humming sound. The relaxation that instantlypervaded his body was so deep that he felt as though he was expelling the achesand fatigues of a lifetime. He had not even realized that he felt so tired, orthat the encounter with Skorbo's killer had so drained his energies. Wave afterwave of delight flowed from the soles of his feet up to his head, then seemed toretreat back again like the tide flowing back down a beach. In spite of hisefforts to remain conscious, one of these waves picked him up and carried himinto oblivion. As soon as Niall opened his eyes, he remembered where he was. He sat up hastily.\"How long have I been asleep?\"\"About two hours.\"The thought filled him with guilt. \"I must get back to the palace.\"\"Why? You are the ruler. You can do what you like.\"This, of course, was true. Moreover, the Council meeting was over for the day.He allowed himself to relax again, adjusting the pillow under his head. Now henoticed the device that was lying beside him on the couch; it was made of half adozen curved strips of metal in the shape of a cap. A wire ran from it to asocket in the side of the couch.\"Place that on your head and adjust it until it is comfortable.\" On the insideof each metal strip there were a number of felt pads; when Niall touched one ofthese with his fingertip he discovered that it was damp. He adjusted the cap onhis head, with the front strip across his forehead, the rear one at the back ofhis skull. There was a faint electrical tingling where the pads touched his bareskin.Behind the frosted glass screen, the light came on again; this time he wasalready relaxed, so it merely induced a warm glow of pleasure.\"Now, close your eyes and try to make your mind a blank.\"Niall tried to imagine total darkness, and was surprised at his success. It wasas if he was suspended in endless space. Then, with a suddenness that startledhim, he heard his mother's voice.\"It has to be grated and pounded, then cooked for at least two hours. Otherwiseit is a deadly poison.\"He was so surprised that he opened his eyes to make sure that she was not in theroom. Even with his eyes open he could hear her voice saying: \"My grandmotherused it to make a kind of wine.\"The voice of his grandfather, Jomar, said: \"She is right. It can also be groundinto flour for making bread.\"The old man asked: \"What can you hear?\"\"It's my mother talking to my grandfather.\"And even as Niall answered, the conversation continued. Suddenly, Niall couldrecall exactly when it had taken place. He was about seven years old, and thefamily had only just moved into the burrow, the lair of the tiger beetle on theedge of the desert. Before that, they had lived in a cave at the foot of thegreat inland plateau; but it had been hot, uncomfortable, and unsafe. Bycomparison, the burrow was cool and secure. When they first moved in, it hadsmelled of the acrid smoke of the burnt creosote bushes that had been used todrive out the tiger beetles. Now, as Niall listened to his mother andgrandfather discussing how to cook the roots of the cassava plant, he could alsosmell the burnt creosote wood. There was another smell which he found moredifficult to place; then it came back: the poultice made from the crushed rootof the devil plant, which had been used to dress the wound in his grandfather'sthigh -- a wound made by the mandibles of a dying tiger beetle.As Niall lay there, he experienced many conflicting emotions and sensations. Apart of him had become a seven-year-old boy, with all the feelings and thoughtsof a seven-year-old. Yet he was also aware of his older self lying there on thecouch of the peace machine, conscious of the presence of the child inside him.It seemed incredible that his memory had preserved this section of his childhoodwith such precision and exactitude, with every single word spoken by his motherand grandfather, and later by his cousin Hrolf, and Hrolf's mother Ingeld. Andthis recognition of the reality of his own past induced a feeling of elation, ofsheer joy in being alive, together with a certainty that all the problems ofhuman life are trivial, and that human beings only take them seriously becausethey are stupid and short-sighted. All these insights were so powerful that theyseemed self-evident, as if he had known them all his life.The old man's voice interrupted his thoughts. \"Can you see where you are?\"\"No.\"\"Very well. I want you to keep your eyes tightly closed, but imagine openingthem.\"At first it was difficult to follow this instruction. When he tried to imagineopening his eyes, he felt his eyelids twitch, and caught a glimpse of the glasspanel above him. Then he tried placing his hands over his eyes, so that it wasimpossible to open them, and envisaged lying on his bed of rushes in the burrow,with his mother only a few feet away. Quite suddenly, the cave was there, and hecould see the face of his grandfather, illuminated by the single oil lamp. Itseemed incredible that his father's father, who had been dead for more thanthree years, should be sitting there in all his living reality, talking toNiall's mother Siris, who sat with her back toward him. With a sudden totaldepth of conviction, Niall reflected that time is an illusion.The old man said: \"Have you succeeded?\"\"Yes.\"\"Very well. Now I want you to try something rather more difficult. I want you tochange this scene completely.\"Niall said: \"How?\" The idea seemed absurd. He was there, in the cave, listeningto his mother and grandfather, and waiting for his father and his uncle Thorg toreturn from a hunting trip.\"Imagine some other scene, and try to see it.\"Niall tried to envisage the outside of the burrow, with its gray-looking shrubsand creosote bushes, and the treelike euphorbia cactus; but it made nodifference. Then, suddenly, everything became dark. A moment later, his motherwas saying: \"It has to be grated and pounded, then cooked for at least twohours. Otherwise it is a deadly poison.\"His grandfather's voice replied: \"It can also be ground into flour for makingbread. . .\"The old man asked: \"What is happening?\"\"It's gone back to the beginning.\"\"Good. Now try again.\"Niall tried concentrating. This made the voices fade; but when he stoppedconcentrating, they came back again. In some strange sense, his efforts seemedto be counterproductive.The old man said: \"Try imagining something that gave you great pleasure.\"Niall tried to conjure up the first time he had seen Princess Merlew. She hadbeen standing beside her father, King Kazak, in the throne room of theunderground city, and her red-gold hair had been held in place by a circlet ofgold. He could still remember the way his heart had lurched when she smiled athim, showing the white, even teeth that were unstained by the juice of berries.He could feel the softness of her skin as they clasped forearms in greeting. . .Then, with a suddenness that startled him, he was holding her in his arms, andshe was saying: \"I've come to take you back with me.\" Her mouth was warm againsthis ear, and he could feel the curves of her body through the red spider silk ofthe dress. His own voice replied: \"You know I can't do that.\" At that moment,Niall recalled that they were no longer in the underground city, but in the cityof the bombardier beetles, and that he was waiting for an audience with theMaster. And now Merlew was checking the door, to make sure the latch was secure,before she lay down on the couch, and drew him down beside her. His whole bodywas responding to the softness of her mouth as she pressed against him. Hissurge of desire was so powerful that he opened his eyes, embarrassed by thepresence of the old man. Like a light being extinguished, the scene disappeared.But this time he was aware of what he had done to make it disappear. He hadswitched his attention elsewhere, like turning his head to look at somethingelse.The old man had also disappeared. Niall felt relieved, and at the same timeamused with his own stupidity. The old man was a machine, yet his reflexescontinued to treat him as a living reality. And all this training was designedto teach him to control his reflexes.He readjusted the metal bands, pressing the contacts against his forehead, thenclosed his eyes and made his mind a blank. Once again he was surprised by thetotal darkness that supervened, as if he was suspended in empty space. This timehe turned his thoughts to his cousin Dona, whom he had seen for the first timein Kazak's underground city. He was trying to conjure up the living quarters ofthe house where she lived with her mother Sefna. Instead, he found himselfsitting beside her on a bench in the garden of the nursery in the spider city.The sunlight was warm, and there was a hissing sound as a fountain threw a sprayof water into the air. A few feet away, his brother Veig was sitting on the lawnwith Runa and Mara, telling them a story. And he and Dona were looking into oneanother's eyes, while cautiously allowing their fingers to touch. . .As he now looked at her -- and she seemed as real as a living person -- he foundhimself wishing that Merlew had some of Dona's gentleness and kindness, and thatDona had a little of Merlew's jaunty vitality and seductiveness. Because theimage of Merlew had so recently been present to his senses, he found it easy toconjure up her presence, as if he was still holding her in his arms. For amoment, Dona receded and gave way to Merlew. By a mental effort, he causedMerlew to recede, so that he was once again sitting beside Dona. It was as if hewere in two places at once, and as if the two women were both trying to occupyhis consciousness. Yet his consciousness was not a room in which Dona and Merlewjostled for space; it was a unified awareness in which both women were equallypresent. With a sudden flash of insight, he realized that this awareness was hisawareness, and that it depended entirely upon his own power to sustain it. Witha spontaneous and instantaneous mental gesture, he blended Merlew and Dona, sothey ceased to be two persons. Merlew took on the gentleness of Dona, while Donasuddenly glowed with a new seductiveness.This result astonished him. He had become so accustomed to the vagaries of theimagination, to his mind's inability to sustain a mental image for more than afew moments, that he found it hard to believe what had happened. It was truethat this new Dona-Merlew was not as real as either of the two women; he wasaware that if he reached out and tried to hold her hand, she would dissolve backinto her constituents. Yet he could look at her, could study the amazing waythat Merlew's pale skin blended into Dona's golden-brown complexion, and the waythat Merlew's blue eyes and Dona's brown eyes united in an intermediate shade ofgreen. Even their clothes had blended, and the new Dona-Merlew was wearing anursemaid's blue tunic made of a clinging spider silk that emphasized the curvesof her body. But what surprised Niall most of all was that the new girl,although less real than either Dona or Merlew, was undoubtedly a separateindividual, a human being with her own unique reality. It seemed impossible tobelieve that she was merely a fantasy, a creation of his own mind.The old man's voice said: \"You may find it simpler to use this.\" When he openedhis eyes, no one was there, but on the pillow, a few inches from his face, therewas a small black box, about three inches square, whose upper face containedfour rows of black numbered buttons. By now, Niall knew enough of electronics toguess that it was a control unit. And since the voice issued no furtherinstructions, he cautiously pushed the first button. This was clearly the on/offswitch. The curious sense of excitement and vitality disappeared immediately,and the world around him seemed to become solid and normal. It was a sensationnot unlike waking up. When he pressed it again, he experienced a slightdistortion of his senses that made him screw up his eyes; this passed, and hefelt once again the electrical tingling that produced such an odd sense ofexpectancy and interest. The effect was not unlike that of the thought mirrorwith which the old man had presented him on his first visit to the tower; butthe thought mirror amplified the powers of concentration, as if looking at theworld through a magnifying glass, while this device seemed to induce a sense ofrelaxation and delight, as if the sun had emerged from behind a cloud.This feeling disappeared as soon as he pressed the second button. This time thedistortion of his senses made him feel sick and giddy; when it vanished, hisbody felt heavy and languorous, and he was overwhelmed by a dreamy sensationthat made the world seem unreal; it was like being awake and asleep at the sametime. He pressed the button again, but this only had the effect of increasingthe dreamlike sensation until his senses blurred, and he felt as if he werehopelessly drunk. But as soon as he pressed the on/off switch, his sensescleared. It was an immense relief to be restored to everyday reality, and forthe first time in his life, Niall realized that the sense of normality deservesto be regarded as a luxury.The pleasure of exploration soon induced him to press the \"on\" switch. Then hepressed the button labeled \"3.\" Nothing happened. He switched off and triedagain. Still nothing happened. He knew that he merely had to speak aloud, andthe voice of the Steegmaster would explain what was wrong. But he preferred towork it out for himself. He stared at the device in his hand, and wrinkled hisnose. The first button switched it on and off. Without that, the second buttonwould not work. Perhaps the second button had to be pressed before the thirdwould work? He tried it, touching the second button quickly and lightly -- hehad already worked out that the intensity of the effect depended on how long heheld it down -- and then pressed the third button. The darkness that supervenedtold him that his guess was correct. A moment later, he was startled by thesound of birdsong, and a noise of running water. At the same time, he couldsmell the indefinable yet distinct odor of wet grass and leaves. But since hewas still in darkness, he had no idea where he was. Then, suddenly, he was inmotion, and could hear the sound of wheels on the hard road, and of the feet ofcharioteers. He lay flat, and tried to imagine that he was opening his eyes.This time it worked immediately, and he found himself sitting between his motherand his brother in a cart pulled by four runners. They were passing through astretch of woodland, and the branches overarched the road and formed a greentunnel. Between the branches overhead, the sky was a deep blue, but he could seestorm clouds hanging over the distant hills; as they passed between two steepbanks, he could reach out and touch the wet grass. They had just landed in thecountry of the spiders, and were being taken to the city of the white tower. Onthe sea voyage from North Khaybad, Niall had saved the life of a wolf spider whohad been swept overboard; this is why they were being treated as guests insteadof prisoners. And now, for the first time since his birth in the desert, Niallwas looking at rain-soaked woodland and hearing the song of the thrush and theblackbird. It had been one of the most memorable sensations of his life, andnow, as he experienced it again, he was bathed in a sense of delight andnostalgia. Although it had been less than a year ago, it seemed to be in anotherlifetime, like a memory of childhood.A moment later, this memory was suddenly replaced by another with which itseemed interconnected. This time he was marching along a moonlit road with agroup of men who were dressed like slaves. In fact, they were young men from thecity of the beetles, and they were setting out on a venture whose dangers werefar greater than they realized: to try to gain access to the old fortress andits arsenal of weapons and explosives. Ulic, Milo, Yorg, Mostig, Crispin,Marcus, Hastur, Renfred, Kosmin, Cyprian were all drunk with the spirit ofadventure; only Doggins, their leader, was aware of the danger. Within a fewhours, three of them would be dead, including Cyprian, who was now marching nextto Niall. . . But in the meantime, Niall breathed in the cold sweetness of thenight air, and absorbed the enchantment of the silvery mist; some strange innerglow of optimism told him that tonight would change the whole direction of hislife. . .Now, at last, Niall felt he was beginning to understand some of the complexitiesof the internalizer. One memory had evoked another because they had some basicfactor in common; and what they had in common was not simply that bothexperiences involved the countryside, but that both involved the same curioussense of delight and freedom.He pressed the fourth button. Again there was darkness but a darkness in whichhe could hear the sighing of the wind, and smell the sharp, salty odor of thesea. Without even having to restore the sense of sight, he knew that he wasstanding on top of the high mountain pass that divided the desert from thecoastal plain of North Khaybad, and that he was smelling the sea for the firsttime. His heart swelled with a tremendous exultation. A moment later he waslooking down on the green plain with its trees and bushes, and at the blueexpanse of the sea that lay beyond. Then the vision blurred and darkened, and hewas lying by a campfire, smelling the wood-smoke and the cold night air, andlistening to sailors harmonizing the chorus of a sea shanty. He knew he was backin North Khaybad, on his way to recover the body of his father, and that theirparty was encamped in the midst of the same green plain he had seen from thehigh mountain pass.At this point a strange thing happened. As he lay there on the couch, listeningto the singing and the crackling of the fire, he felt himself drifting intosleep. It was then that he realized that his \"earlier self\" must have fallenasleep at about this point, and that he had been witnessing that drift into thetwilight world between sleep and waking. And now he was fascinated to observethe blurred images that wandered like slow clouds before his inner vision, andthe alien voices that uttered meaningless yet strangely significant phrases --one of them said: \"His greenness will be more obstinate when he finds his tail.\"Then the voices seemed to turn into water which seeped into the cracks of hisunconscious mind and ran into some underground lake of darkness. The effect wasso strange that it made him feel sick and dizzy, as if everything had becomeunreal. He groped for the \"off\" button of the control unit, and felt a flood ofrelief as the normal world returned like daylight after a nightmare.His curiosity about the control unit still strong, he touched the final buttonof the bottom row, which was labeled \"20.\" The result was as unexpected as itwas unpleasant. He was suddenly gripped by a convulsion of sorrow and miserythat struck with the unexpectedness of a summer storm or a violent blow. He wasstanding in the entrance to the burrow, looking down at a hideously swollencorpse which he could just recognize as that of his father. The face was blackand the open eyes were bulging. The arm, wearing a copper bracelet, was flung upas if to protect the face from the fangs of an angry spider.The old man's voice said: \"I think that perhaps you should switch off themachine.\"He was standing again by the couch. Niall's energies had been so drained by theshock that it cost him an effort of will to press the \"off\" button. He said:\"Why did it do that?\" Even his lips felt numb.\"The electrical pulses of the internalizer cause memory circuits to discharge.You selected a frequency connected with traumatic memories.\"\"But what good is it?\" He knew the question was irrational, but the shock wasturning to anger.\"Far more than you think.\" The old man's voice was so calm and reasonable thathis anger evaporated. \"I would advise you to repeat the experience.\"\"Why?\" Niall's faith in the Steegmaster was implicit, but the idea appalled him.\"Because it will make the pain disappear. Try it.\" Bracing himself as if for ablow, Niall switched on the unit, then pressed the button labeled \"20.\" Again hewas assailed by waves of misery as he looked at his father's distorted face;this time he even noticed the puncture marks on the underside of the arm wherethe spider had injected the poison. Yet he was also aware that the misery wasbeing experienced by the Niall who was standing in the entrance to the burrow,and that he himself was feeling it at second hand.\"Again.\" The old man's voice actually sounded sympathetic. As he pressed thebutton, and the memory returned to the beginning, he was even more clearly awareof the gap between his present and his past self. When that past self hadexperienced a sense of numbness, it had been a defense against an overwhelmingsurge of emotion; now the emotion had lost some of its power, Niall ceased toexperience the numbness. Instead, he experienced rage and pity, and a sense ofthe futility of his father's death. \"Again.\"This time, even the rage and pity had lost their force.\"Again.\"This time he felt only pity.\"Again.\"The pity became a sense of sadness mingled with futile regrets.\"Again.\"Now he could see that even regret and sadness were pointless; it had happened,and there was nothing he could do about it.\"Again.\"Niall shook his head. \"There's no need to do it again.\" He felt curiously calmand peaceful; he was also experiencing an odd sensation, as if he was growingphysically older second by second. He asked: \"How did the machine do that?\"\"It didn't. Your own mind did it. Any negative emotion can be erased by relivingit.\"To his surprise, he found himself yawning. The sense of shock had given way to apleasant feeling of relaxation. But his brain felt tired, with the kind offatigue he had experienced after making too much use of the thought mirror. Heclosed his eyes for a moment, tempted to fall asleep, then remembered why he wasthere, and forced himself back into wakefulness.\"You said I could learn about Skorbo's killers.\"\"You wish to make the attempt now?\"\"Yes, if it's possible.\"\"It is possible, but perhaps not entirely advisable. You need more practice withthe internalizer. I would suggest at least another day.\"Niall shook his head. \"There's not time. One of them may still be in the city,and he could be gone by tomorrow.\"\"It is your choice. You understand the dangers.\"He asked with misgiving: \"Dangers?\"\"You have already encountered the worst of them. Negative emotions.\"\"The worst?\" He could not keep a note of relief out of his voice.\"You should not underestimate negative emotion.\" There was a hint of reproof inhis tone.\"Of course. But if you don't object. . .\"\"It is not for me to object or approve.\"Again Niall had to remind himself that Steeg was a computer, not a human being.\"Then tell me what I have to do.\"\"First of all, concentrate upon this man. Try to envisage him clearly. It mayhelp you to hold the pendant in your hand. Then, when you are ready, pressnumber two, which induces the alpha state, then number nine, which amplifiesshort-term memory -- the experiences of the past few hours. You may then beginto receive impressions. If this fails, try deepening the alpha state.\"Niall took the pendant from his pocket and held it in his right hand. But thisseemed pointless; after all, he could not see it while he was holding it.Instead, he placed the chain round his neck, so the pendant rested on his chest.Then he touched the second button. The dreamy sensation returned, accompanied bya feeling that was like falling backwards. Now he closed his eyes, and envisagedthe face of the dead man, with its large eyes, beaklike nose, and weak chin. Fora moment it was real; then it became blurred. Even in the hour since he had seenit, the memory had faded, overlaid by other impressions. The more he tried tovisualize it precisely, the less clear it became. He opened his eyes and touchedthe ninth button. The result was startling. He was again standing in therubble-strewn corridor, smelling its distinctive odor of damp plaster and dust,and looking into the strange, dark eyes. He braced himself, knowing what wasabout to happen. There was the sensation of being struck violently in the face,while at the same time, his breathing was cut off as if someone had gripped hiswindpipe. His senses blurred, and everything seemed to go into slow motion. Yetbecause he was also observing it all from a distance, he also continued to stareinto the face of his attacker, and to observe its expression of uncertainty andanxiety. He even experienced a flash of sympathy: this man was alone in ahostile city, surrounded by enemies. His safety depended on not beingrecognized, and now that he had been recognized, he had ceased to be the hunter,and became the quarry. . .Over the man's shoulder, Niall saw the glue spider lowering itself silently outof its hole in the ceiling. The man heard it as its feet touched the floor, andstarted to turn. Before he could do so, he was struck by the will power of thespider and immobilized; moments later, he was being held down on the floor bythe spider's front legs, and a fine spray of glue was being squirted into hisface. At the same time, Niall's vision cleared, and he became aware that Simeonwas bending over him and helping him to his feet.He knew what would happen next, and the thought sickened him. Even as he waspressing the \"off\" button, the man was leaping to his feet and reaching for theknife hidden inside his garment; then, like a light being extinguished, hevanished.The old man said: \"You learned what you wanted to know?\"\"No.\"\"What happened?\"\"The man was about to commit suicide, and I didn't want to see it.\"\"I see.\"The calm, level voice made him feel ashamed of himself. In the silence thatfollowed, he said: \"I'll try again.\"\"One moment.\" Niall paused, his finger on the control. \"Every time you do this,you use up mental energy. The more tired you become, the less you are likely todiscover -- the tired mind is unobservant.\"Niall knew he was right; his brain was feeling heavy and dull. \"I'll try justonce more.\"\"Very well. But a word of advice. The longer you hold down the second control,the deeper the alpha state. This will increase your sensitivity. But it willalso make you more vulnerable. I would suggest that you keep your finger on theoff control.\"\"Thanks. I will.\"He closed his eyes and made his mind a blank, deliberately inducing relaxation.Then he pressed the \"on\" switch and touched the second button. The dreamy senseof unreality was a little like sinking into a sea of some soft, silky materialthat caressed his senses. He was aware of hovering in the borderland betweensleeping and waking, where the slightest relaxation of attention would allow himto drift into sleep. A huge wooden cart with massive timber beams trundledacross the threshold of his mind, while a female voice stated clearly: \"Allelephants are misfits in the world of fleas.\" An effort of will propelled himback toward consciousness, and he depressed the ninth button, on which hisfinger was already resting. He was immediately back in the corridor, runningafter the man in slave uniform. As he seized the shoulder of his tunic, the manstumbled and crashed sideways against the wall. The scene had the clarity of adream, and was in such vivid detail that it seemed to be taking place in a kindof slow motion. The man was turning his head, and Niall was looking into thelarge eyes, and experiencing his sense of panic and desperation; it was so acutethat Niall felt sorry for him. Then came the sensation of a violent blow, andthe choking sense of suffocation. But this time, Niall saw the \"blow\" coming:the concentration of the will, the focusing of a beam of aggression, thedeliberate assault on the control center of his nervous system. Then, as theirminds came into contact, his own identity seemed to blend into that of hisassailant, as if they had become the same person. For a few seconds, the man'swhole life was spread out for Niall's inspection. What he saw shocked andrepelled him. Once again, he experienced the unpleasant sensation, like adisagreeable smell, and this time was aware that it sprang from a certainruthlessness and brutality. The sheer complexity of what he was seeing wasbewildering, although its salient features were clear enough; it was a littlelike looking down on the Earth from outer space. He needed time to study andtake it in.But already the man was springing to his feet and reaching into his bosom; hishand was emerging with the knife as Niall touched the \"off\" control.\"Well?\"Niall said: \"He was a trained killer.\"\"Was Skorbo the intended victim, or was he chosen at random?\"Niall had to search his memory. It was like trying to remember a dream. \"Theintended victim.\"\"Where do they come from?\"\"Somewhere. . . underground.\"\"Dira?\"\"No, not Dira. Some. . . other place.\"\"Do you know where?\"Niall closed his eyes and tried to focus the memory, but it was no good.\"No. It all happened too quickly.\"\"That can be remedied, of course. What else did you find out?\"\"Hatred. . . I could sense hatred. This man was a kind of trained butcher orexecutioner. And there was something else I didn't understand. . . He wasn'tentirely human.\"\"In what sense?\"\"I don't know. It was just something I felt.\"There was a silence. Niall said: \"It seems incredible. . . that there could beanother underground city. Surely you'd know about it?\"The old man shook his head. \"I am afraid our information-gathering system is notinfallible.\"\"But a whole city. . .\"\"There is a curious legend that dates back to the twentieth century, a legend ofspace travelers from a distant galaxy who landed on Earth when they were at theend of their resources. Solar radiation was deadly to them, so they builtcolonies underground, and created a complex civilization when mankind was stillliving in caves. But the hardships of living underground gradually caused theirnumbers to decrease. Many of those who were left began to suffer from a kind ofinsanity, so they turned into monsters.\"\"Monsters?\"\"They ceased to behave rationally. Some of them began to eat human beings. Thestories declare that these people were the origin of legends about vampires,ghouls, troglodytes, and other sinister creatures from underground.\"\"But is that true?\"The old man chuckled. \"Torwald Steeg would have said that it was obviousnonsense. But he would also have acknowledged that it is impossible to know howmuch truth there is in a legend.\"\"Then how can we find out about this underground city?\"\"At the moment, your main hope lies in the internalizer. Your minds were only incontact for a moment, yet you may have learned far more than you realize.\"Niall reached for the control unit, then hesitated. \"You say I should wait untiltomorrow?\"\"That is your decision. If you are tired, the results will be poor.\"Niall's head ached and he felt exhausted; yet his curiosity was stronger thanhis fatigue. \"I think I'll try just once more. . .\"He lay down, closed his eyes, and touched the \"on\" button. The headachedissolved away, and he experienced an overwhelming temptation to fall asleep. Heresisted this and touched the second button. It was even more difficult toresist the waves of dreamy relaxation that tried to wash away his consciousness.Before this could happen, he touched the ninth button.Once again he was in the rubble-strewn corridor with its smell of damp plaster.But this time the experience was so vivid that it was hard to believe that itwas unreal. As in a dream, the walls looked quite solid, and the floor under hisfeet was obviously hard. His underlying tiredness seemed to sharpen hisperceptions, with the effect of slow motion. Even as he was pursuing the manalong the corridor, he could see the glue spider looking out of its hole in theceiling, and this observation made him aware that his perceptions were notconfined to his memory of the event. As if in a real life situation, he coulddirect his attention to anything he chose. As he reached out to grab the man'sshoulder, he noticed a few links of the gold chain showing from under the slavegarment. Then the man stumbled and turned -- Niall felt that he now knew hisface as well as that of his own father or mother; he also noticed the badlyshaven chin and the oddly feral quality of his teeth. When the blow came, itseemed to be like a kick deliberately aimed at his solar plexus. He wasinterested to observe that the man was using a kind of emotional negativeenergy; it was as if he had looked at Niall with hatred, and the hatred hadsomehow turned into a physical force, like a clenched fist. And this, Niall nowrealized, was because it had been directed at his own emotional center.As their minds came into contact he was again aware of his distaste, a desire toturn away his face, as if from an unpleasant smell. But this time he resistedthe impulse, determined to try to understand as much as possible of the killer'slife and background. Again there was a vertiginous sensation of seeing too manythings, so many that his mind had no chance to retain them.It was at this point that the whole quality of the experience underwent achange. So far, he had been aware that he was studying a kind of recording, amemory trace that had been fixed in time. Now, suddenly, he had the curioussensation of being in contact with a living mind. This was obviously absurd,since the man was dead. Yet the experience was unmistakable. The differencebetween studying a memory-recording and probing a living mind was as plain anddistinct as the difference between touching the cold flesh of a corpse and thewarm flesh of a living person. His mind recoiled in fear and alarm. In thatmoment he became aware that both he and Skorbo's killer were standing in anarrow stone chamber, in complete darkness. There was an impression of cold. Afew feet in front of them, a man was seated in a stone chair that was not unlikethe throne on which King Kazak had received visitors in Dira. In spite of thedarkness, the man in the chair was completely visible, as if to some sense otherthan sight. He was dressed in a long, black garment like a monk's robe, and hisface was concealed inside its cowl. Yet in spite of being able to see in thedark, Niall was unable to see the face inside the hood; only the whites of theeyes were dimly visible, and they seemed to stare with an unblinking intensitythat was unnerving.Dark shoes with curled tips peeped out from under the robe. The only other partof the man that was visible were the hands that rested on the arms of the chair.Niall observed that these seemed to be scaly, like the skin of a lizard or asnake, although the flesh was the color of normal human flesh. The fingers wereconnected together with a web of almost transparent flesh.In the moment Niall suddenly found himself in his presence, this man wasapparently questioning Skorbo's killer, who was standing before him with bowedhead, in an attitude of respect. But as Niall stared with astonishment at theman in the stone chair, Skorbo's killer seemed to sense Niall's presence; amoment later, the seated man also became aware of him. Niall had the impressionthat the eyes had narrowed, and as they turned on him, it cost him an effort notto take a step backwards; there was an almost physical force in the stare. Hisbodiless state seemed to amplify his sensitivity, so that he was abnormallyconscious of the personality behind the eyes. Oddly enough, there was no senseof evil or malice; only of ruthless fanaticism that was akin to blindness. Hesensed that this was a being who would regard anyone who opposed or disagreedwith him as an enemy who deserved to be exterminated.The man raised his right hand from the arm of the chair and pointed at Niallwith a finger that seemed to have a claw instead of a nail; it might have been agesture of admonishment. As he did so, Niall experienced an agonizing sensationin his chest. It felt as though some small crablike creature had leapt on to hischest and clung there, gripping with sharp little claws that seemed to extend ina circle, like those of certain bugs or lice. The pain made him gasp; yet as hisfingers tried to tear it away, he could see there was nothing there.A moment later, he was back on the couch in the white tower, and the sun wasstreaming in through the window. His feeling of relief gave way to horror as herealized that the invisible entity was still tearing at his chest, as if intenton eating its way into his heart. The internalizer had been switched off, theroom looked solid and normal. Yet he was still aware of the gaze of the narrowbrown eyes, and of the intense pain in his chest. As his hands clawed at theneck of his tunic, they snapped the fine gold chain that held the pendant roundhis neck; it flew across the room and landed on the floor. At that moment, thepain stopped, and he ceased to be aware of the brown eyes.\"What happened?\"Niall shook his head; once again, he felt drained and exhausted. But this timeit was not the tiredness that follows a shock, but an aching sense of fatigue,as if he had just been subjected to some enormous strain that had brought him tothe verge of physical breakdown.He pointed at the pendant, which was lying against the wall. \"That thing nearlykilled me.\"The old man picked it up. \"That is impossible. It is merely a piece of metal.\"Niall felt too exhausted to argue. He said: \"It's some kind of transmitter. \"The old man shook his head. \"My analysis indicates that it is an alloy of copperand zinc, with a trace of gold. It is quite solid, and therefore contains notransmitter.\"\"I don't give a damn what your analysis says.\" Niall was aware that histiredness was causing his voice to choke with frustration. He forced himself tobe calm, and allowed his head to sink back on the pillow. The peace machineimmediately began to vibrate -- he realized this was an automatic response tohis tension -- and he experienced an instant sense of relief. \"Please switchthat thing off.\" The vibrations ceased. \"I don't want to go to sleep. I want tofind out what happened.\"\"Yes, of course. I understand.\" The mechanically soothing voice caused a wave ofirritation, and he had to remind himself that it would be pointless to lose histemper with a machine. \"Please describe what happened.\"Niall drew a deep breath. \"I found myself standing in a dark room with Skorbo'skiller. There was an old man sitting on a kind of throne -- a man in a longblack robe. And when he realized I was there, he attacked me with his mind.\"\"At which point, I realized you were having a nightmare and switched off themachine.\"\"It was not a nightmare!\" Niall found it hard to keep his voice down. \"I'mcertain he was real.\"\"Very well, he was real.\" The flat, reasonable voice was infuriating. \"And whatof Skorbo's assassin?\"\"He was real, too. He was the first one to notice me.\"\"Then he was not dead after all?\"\"Yes, he's dead.\" His own voice sounded dull and flat.\"How is that possible? You said he was alive.\"\"I said he was real. Perhaps he was some kind of a ghost.\"\"The Steegmaster does not make allowance for the existence of ghosts, except inthe psychological sense. Torwald Steeg believed that ghosts are a primitivesuperstition.\"Niall spoke with his eyes closed. \"I don't care what Steeg believed. I'm tellingyou what happened.\" The peace machine switched on again; as the waves ofrelaxation flowed through him, Niall was tempted to allow it to soothe away histiredness and frustration. But something in him revolted at this surrender tomere physical comfort. He said: \"Turn that thing off. We've got to get to thebottom of this.\"\"Of course.\" The vibrations ceased. \"But please consider what I am saying. Yourdescription bears all the hallmarks of a nightmare. You insist that it was real.But you forget that the psychoscope has the power to make dreams appear to berealities.\"It sounded highly plausible. Niall realized suddenly that the old man could beright after all. \"But why should a nightmare make me feel so exhausted?\"\"This is why I warned you against using the psychoscope when you are overtired.Tiredness creates negative emotions, and the psychoscope amplifies them.\"\"But would it make me feel as if something had drained all the life out of me?\"\"Not normally. But that is something that can easily be tested.\"\"How?\"\"By measuring your life-field.\" He passed out of Niall's line of sight, behindthe peace machine, and emerged a moment later holding two retractable wires --coiled so they were like long springs -- which terminated in bell-shaped cups.He held out one of these to Niall. \"Please place this against your inner thigh.\"Niall raised his tunic and pressed the cup against his flesh, where itimmediately attached itself. \"Please moisten your lower lip.\" He pressed thesecond cup against Niall's lip; Niall felt his flesh sucked inward as itgripped.\"What does it do?\"\"Measures the electrical field associated with your vitality.\" He disappearedbehind the machine; there was a humming sound, which lasted only a few seconds."},{"pageContent":"Niall said: \"Well?\"\"That is strange.\" He detached the two cups. \"Your lambda reading is down to8.5.\"\"And what should it be?\"\"A normal reading is between 10.5 and 11.\"\"So it could have been real?\" He experienced a sinking of the heart; it had beenpleasant to believe that the man with the webbed fingers had merely been adream.\"Not necessarily. You forget that your energies were drained by the man whoattacked you. And the psychoscope uses up a great deal of vital energy.\"\"Don't you have some machine for putting it back again?\"\"Of course.\" Niall looked at him with surprise; his comment had been intended asa joke. \"The peace machine has an inbuilt Bentz apparatus for inducing anartificial life-field. That should at least restore your electrical potential.\"Niall's weariness was turning into a headache, accompanied by a feeling ofnausea.\"Can it stop me feeling sick?\"\"I think so.\"A bright blue light came on behind the frosted glass panel, accompanied by awhining sound that soon passed beyond the range of audibility. The light hurthis eyes, and he closed them tight. Then, as the sound faded, his headache fadedwith it. At the same time he began to experience a curious inner glow ofoptimism. He felt an absurd desire to chuckle, and a sensation that made himfeel slightly breathless, as if someone had sprayed ice-cold water in his face.He gasped and drew a deep breath as the weariness turned into a pleasure thatwas close to pain. There was a brimming sensation of vitality, one curiousconsequence of which was a tickling sensation at the back of his throat; amoment later, this exploded into a sneeze. The blue light immediately vanished,and the serenity gave way to a feeling of normality that was like waking up. Hegroped in his pocket for his handkerchief, as he blew his nose, there was aflash of pain in the back of his skull.The old man stood silently, looking at the dial. The silence lasted so long thatNiall asked: \"Is something wrong?\"\"Something is causing your life-field to leak.\"He felt a twinge of alarm. \"What does that mean?\"\"It means that we are dealing with some unknown factor that I cannot explain.\"Niall watched with curiosity as Steeg picked up the pendant on its broken chain,carried it to the other end of the room, and dropped it into a cylindricalobject that might have been a wastepaper basket made of copper-wire mesh.\"What are you doing?\"\"Taking a simple precaution. The rupture of your biophysical membrane suggeststhat you have been in contact with some hostile entity. If this pendant is itstransmitter, then an electromagnetic field will render it harmless.\"\"So you think it wasn't a nightmare after all?\"\"I cannot judge. Your earlier encounter may have done more damage than youthink.\"Even as he was speaking, Niall could feel the euphoria induced by the Bentzapparatus leaking away, like air escaping from a punctured balloon.\"Can the damage be repaired?\"\"Certainly. It will heal itself in due course, like a cut or graze. But theprocess can be accelerated by the Bentz apparatus.\"As he spoke, the blue glow radiated from behind the frosted glass, and theelectrical hum rose in pitch until it passed beyond the range of the human ear.This time the glow was less intense; it might have been the pale blue of awinter sky. The sensations that accompanied it were correspondingly lessintense; but the headache dissolved slowly, as if blown away by a faint breeze.As the vitality seeped back into him, like water into parched earth, Niallsuddenly knew, beyond any possibility of doubt, that the man in the black robewas a reality, and that his own life was now in danger. It was already dark when he emerged from the tower, and the temperature haddropped below freezing. In the cold black sky the stars looked like fragments ofwhite ice; a faint glow on the western horizon announced the rising of the moon.The snow had frozen, so that with every footstep he had to crunch through thehard surface. In the great avenue, lights glowed behind windows, and the soundof music drifted on the bitter wind. He had always found it pleasant to observelighted windows, particularly in upper stories; in the days of slavery, humanbeings had been confined to basements, and lights had to be extinguished soonafter dusk. But now he experienced only a sense of foreboding; it was as if thehuman beings in the lighted rooms were too vulnerable.One thing was clear: the killers had time on their side. The tree that hadstruck Skorbo to the ground had been planted at least a year ago, the symbol ofrevenge hidden beneath its roots. If necessary they could afford to wait anotheryear to claim their next victim. . . Yet the tree had failed to kill Skorbo, andone of the executioners had died as he tried to redeem the failure; that provedthey were not infallible.In the entrance hall of the palace, the log fire still blazed in its huge grate.His brother Veig was standing in front of it, one arm around a girl as hewhispered in her ear. The sound of the closing door made them break apart, andshe ran away toward the kitchen -- Niall recognized her as the prettiest of thekitchen maids, a girl called Nyra. He felt a twinge of envy -- not for hisbrother's amorous escapades, but for the simplicity of his life.Veig said cheerfully: \"Had a hard day, brother?\"\"A long one.\" Niall stretched out his hands toward the blaze.\"Why don't you take a day off. You are the king, you know.\"Niall accepted the bantering tone without resentment; he understood thedifficulties of his brother's position. Veig had always been fond of his youngerbrother, as well as highly protective. Now, suddenly, he was merely the king'selder brother with nothing much to do but hang around the city and flirt withpretty girls. A less amiable man might have been envious and resentful; Veig wasfar too good-natured for that. But he still felt the need to assert hisindependence.Nephtys leaned over the stone balustrade above them. \"Are you ready to eat, mylord?\"\"Yes, I am.\" It had reminded him that he had not eaten since breakfast, and wasfamished. He asked Veig: \"Have you eaten?\"\"Yes, but I'll join you in a glass of wine.\"It had been many months since the brothers had shared a meal together. Niall hadbeen too busy with his duties, while Veig seemed determined to make up for theyears during which he had been starved of female company. Even now, as theymounted the stairs behind Nephtys, his eyes studied the shapely legs under theshort tunic.In Niall's chamber, burning wood crackled in the stove, and the air was full ofits smell. Jarita, the maidservant, was already setting out food on the lowtable.Nephtys pointed to a long bundle wrapped in sacking, which leaned against thewall inside the door. \"A man brought that for you.\"\"Do you know his name?\"\"Yes. The overseer, Dion.\"Niall laid the bundle on the floor, and unwrapped the sacking. It was an ax,with a haft about four feet long. The shining blade was stained with driedblood. Etched into the blade was the sign with which he was already familiar:the symbol of revenge.\"Did he say where it had been found?\"\"He said in the garden, among the undergrowth.\"Veig picked it up and swung it through the air. \"It's beautifully balanced. Andas sharp as a razor.\"\"Be careful. It's the ax that killed Skorbo.\"\"I guessed that.\" Veig tested the blade with his thumb, then snatched his handaway. \"My god, it's sharp!\" A drop of blood ran down his thumb.\"Go and wash it, quickly!\" Niall was remembering the poisoned knife that hadkilled Skorbo's assassin in a matter of seconds. To his horror, Veig licked thecut and said casually: \"It'll be all right.\" It was only when, a minute or solater, Veig was still obviously unaffected that he allowed himself to relax.Niall rewrapped the ax in its sacking, and handed it to Nephtys. \"Here, take itaway.\"Veig threw himself down on a heap of cushions, and poured two glasses of thepale golden mead; it had been freshly made, and was still sparkling with risingbubbles. He drank down half the glass in one draught, then lay back with a smileof contentment.\"Well, whoever killed Skorbo did a good job.\"Niall shook his head warningly, glancing toward Jarita, who had just entered theroom with a dish of roast skylarks. Veig grinned broadly and raised hiseyebrows. With his curly black hair and bright blue eyes, he exerted a charmthat made it impossible to be annoyed with him. When Jarita had left, he asked:\"Don't you trust her?\"\"Of course, but I don't want to shock her. You forget that most of the people inthis city still think of the spiders as their masters.\"\"That may be so.\" Veig picked up a roast skylark and dipped it in the savorysauce. \"But they still hated Skorbo.\"\"Why? Most of them didn't even know him.\"Veig chewed and swallowed before he replied, wiping the gravy from his beardwith the back of his hand. \"But they knew all about him.\"Niall was intrigued by his tone. \"What did they know about him?\"\"He had a reputation as a brute. He enjoyed killing human beings. They say heeven enjoyed killing children -- not just to eat them, but for the fun of makingthem scream. And of course, they say he's never stopped.\" Veig returned tognawing the bird.\"Never stopped what?\"\"Killing and eating human beings.\"Niall stared at him incredulously. \"Are you serious?\"\"Didn't you know?\" Veig shook his head in mild surprise. \"I thought everybodyknew.\"Niall put down the bird he was eating. \"Where did you hear that?\"\"I think Sidonia told me.\" Sidonia was the captain of the Spider Lord'shousehold guard; Veig was known to spend much of his time in her company.\"But what did she tell you?\"\"Oh, that Skorbo and a bunch of his cronies didn't like the idea of giving uphuman flesh. Besides, they'd got quite a few left over from the days of slavery.They thought it'd be a pity to let all that meat go to waste, so they went oneating it.\"Niall heaved a sigh of relief. \"I thought you meant they were still eatingpeople.\"\"So they are. Nyra told me that one of her brothers disappeared a few weeksago.\"\"Nyra? That girl from the kitchen? Then why didn't she report it to me?\"Veig resumed his bird. \"I think most people assumed you knew about it.\"Niall felt stunned. \"They really thought I'd allow that to go on?\"\"Well. . . I suppose they thought there was nothing you could do about it.\"Niall had to make an effort to keep his voice under control. He said: \"When theSpider Lord agreed to end slavery, he also agreed that there should be no morekilling of human beings. The terms of the treaty were that men and spidersshould be free and equal. Now you tell me the spiders have never kept their sideof the bargain. . .\" He took a drink of mead to steady his voice.Veig said mildly: \"Don't blame me.\"\"I'm not blaming you.\" Niall felt as if the ground had collapsed under his feet.\"But are you certain the Spider Lord knew about this?\"\"Oh no, I didn't say that. I'm pretty sure he didn't. What Sidonia told me wasthat Skorbo and a few of his mates resented the idea of not eating human flesh.So they went on eating the people in their larder. And when they'd finishedthose, I suppose they decided to restock the larder.\"Niall picked up the handbell on the table and rang it. Jarita hurried into theroom.\"Go down to the kitchen and ask Nyra to come up here.\"\"Yes, lord.\"When they were alone, Niall chewed moodily at a piece of bread crust; hisappetite had all but vanished. Veig was eating with undiminished gusto. Niallsaid: \"I can't understand why you didn't tell me the moment you learned aboutit.\"Veig looked embarrassed. \"As a matter of fact, I didn't come back to the palacefor a couple of days.\"\"Then why didn't you tell me as soon as you came back?\"\"You weren't here then. You were inspecting the harbor installations. You alwaysseem to be so busy that I didn't like to disturb you.\" He picked up a napkin anddabbed at his bleeding thumb. \"You always work so hard that you make me feellike a layabout.\"Niall felt a glow of affection for his brother; but it was still outweighed byhis sense of foreboding.\"There's nothing to stop you working.\"\"At what?\" Veig spread out his hands. \"I'm no good on committees and councils.What else is there for me to do except lounge around and eat too much?\" It wastrue that Veig had put on a great deal of weight recently. \"But I'll tell youone thing.\" He spoke with sudden seriousness. \"I've often wished I was back inthe desert and setting out for a good day's hunting.\"Niall grunted. \"There aren't any girls in the desert.\"\"Oh, you can have too much of anything. . .\" He was about to say more when theywere interrupted by Jarita's return; she was followed by Nyra. The kitchen maidwas a shapely girl in her early teens, with soft brown eyes and a startlinglyperfect profile. The beauty of the girls in the spider city never ceased toamaze Niall, even though he knew it was the result of selective breeding.She stood in front of them, her eyes downcast, her hands clasped over her apron.Her long brown hair had been plaited, and coiled around her head -- one of therules for girls working in the kitchen.Niall said: \"Veig tells me that one of your brothers has disappeared?\" Shenodded, evidently too nervous to speak. Niall tuned in to her thoughts, andrealized that she was almost paralyzed with self-consciousness. It shocked himto realize that she regarded him as an almost godlike being, and that she wasafraid he had sent for her to dismiss her for flirting with Veig. He saidgently: \"Tell me what happened.\"She cleared her throat. \"He went out after dark and didn't come back.\"\"Where do you live?\"\"In the street of the leather beaters.\"\"Is it very dark?\" She nodded. \"And where did he go?\"\"Across the street to see a friend. He'd left his horse there.\"\"His horse?\"\"A wooden toy. He just ran across to get it.\"\"Did you go out and look for him?\" She shook her head. \"Why not?\"\"We don't go out after dark.\"\"Why not?\"\"It's not really allowed. . .\"\"But that was in the days of slavery! Now you can go anywhere.\"She nodded, her eyes still on the ground, her cheeks bright red withembarrassment. Suddenly Niall understood. This girl's family found it difficultto adjust to their new freedom. It was almost impossible to break the habit of alifetime. This was why they had failed to report the child's disappearance. Hehad been out after dark, and that was against the law; therefore, they had beenpunished.\"Have you heard of any more disappearances?\"\"Only one. A girl in the next street.\"\"Did anyone see or hear anything?\"\"No.\"That was to be expected. A spider dropped silently out of the dark, paralyzingits victim with will-force, and whisked him back into the air in a matter ofseconds; there was almost nothing to see or hear.\"All right. Thank you, Nyra. I'll see if there's anything I can do.\" She wasstill so tongue-tied and self-conscious that he had to add \"You may go\" beforeshe curtseyed and hurried out of the room. Veig stared after her withadmiration. Niall had shared the feeling when she came in; now it hadevaporated. Looking into her mind had made him aware of her essence, which wasthat of a normal teenager of average intelligence. Veig, who lacked hisbrother's telepathic powers, was entranced by her remarkable beauty, andtherefore possessed by a desire to explore it and discover whether her mind wasequally fascinating. Niall knew in advance that he would be disappointed -- andyet that there was no possible way in which he could share the insight with hisbrother. This realization saddened him and made him thoughtful.Veig said: \"What are you going to do?\" He was pouring another glass of mead.\"I shall have to speak to the Spider Lord.\"\"Is that a good idea?\" The thought of voluntarily seeking a confrontation withthe Spider Lord appalled him.\"Why not?\"\"It might only make things worse. . .\"\"That's why Skorbo was able to go on killing human beings -- because no onedared to say anything about it. If someone had told me sooner, Nyra's brothermight still be alive.\"\"I suppose you're right.\" He was obviously unconvinced.There was a light tap on the door, and Nephtys came in. \"The doctor would liketo speak to you, my lord.\"Veig asked: \"Doctor?\"\"That's what they call Simeon. There was no such thing as a doctor in this citybefore he came. Ah, come in, Simeon. Would you like a glass of wine?\"\"Thanks. I need one.\" Simeon looked and sounded tired. Nephtys took his cloak,while Jarita helped him to take off his boots, which were covered with snow. Hesank down with a groan of relief onto the cushions, and accepted the glass ofmead that Veig offered him. He drank with obvious appreciation, then sigheddeeply.Niall asked: \"Where have you come from?\"\"The slave quarter.\" He was already helping himself to one of the birds.\"Did they find the other assassin?\"\"Oh yes, they found him.\" Simeon spoke through a full mouth.\"Where is he now?\"\"Dead.\"\"How? Did he kill himself, like the other one?\" Still chewing, Simeon shook hishead. \"Did a spider kill him?\"\"No.\" Simeon swallowed. \"The spider had him pinned down so he couldn't move amuscle. The first thing I did was take his knife away. Only then did the spiderrelease him. I asked him questions, but he didn't reply -- he pretended not tounderstand. So I told the spider to hurt him a little -- I didn't like doing itbut I wanted to learn where he came from. The spider squeezed him a little andhe screamed. But he still wouldn't talk. I'll say this for him, he was a braveman.\"Niall winced at the picture Simeon conjured up. When Simeon spoke of squeezinghe was not referring to physical pressure. A fully grown death spider couldsqueeze a man by sheer will-force, like a nut in a nutcracker, until he felt hisbones cracking under the pressure. Niall had experienced it in his firstencounter with the Death Lord, and the thought still made him shudder.\"What happened then?\"\"They decided to take him back to the headquarters of the Spider Lord. Ifollowed on in a chariot. But halfway across the bridge, they sent for me tocome and examine him. He was dead.\"Veig said: \"Probably died of fright.\"\"No. It looked like a heart attack -- blue lips and a dead white face.\"Niall asked: \"Where is he now?\"\"In the mortuary.\"\"I'd like to see him.\"Simeon and Veig both stared at him with amazement.\"What for?\" Simeon obviously suspected him of harboring some morbid obsessionabout corpses.\"There's something I'd like to find out.\"Veig asked: \"Is it a secret?\"\"No.\" He turned to Simeon, who had resumed eating. \"Was this man wearing apendant around his neck?\"\"Yes.\"\"Did you remove it?\"\"No. Why should I? It was the same as this one.\" He gestured toward his chest.Niall experienced a chill that was like a cold wind. \"You're wearing it roundyour neck?\"\"Yes. Why not?\"Niall kept his voice calm and casual. \"Could I see it please?\" He held out hishand. Simeon was obviously puzzled; nevertheless he reached under his tunic,lifted the gold chain over his head, and handed the pendant to Niall. As Niallheld it in the palm of his hand, he felt for a moment that it was alive, likesome small insect; he dropped it hastily. A moment later, when he picked it upagain, the sense of life had vanished; it was merely a piece of metal alloy.Moved by some natural instinct, he dropped it into his glass of mead. The othertwo were watching him with astonishment.Simeon asked: \"What was all that about?\"Niall hesitated, realizing that it would sound absurd; for a moment he eventhought of prevaricating, then decided against it. He gestured at the glass. \"Ithink that's what killed him.\"Simeon shook his head in bewilderment. \"Why?\"Niall said: \"Why do you suppose they were all wearing these things around theirnecks? As some kind of decoration? That would be stupid. If one of them wascaught, it would mean that the other two could be identified more easily. No,it's some kind of communicator.\"Both of them stared at the pendant, which was now coated with bubbles. Simeonasked: \"What makes you think so?\"\"I took the other one into the white tower.\"Simeon nodded. \"Aha, I see!\"Niall allowed the misapprehension to stand; it saved explanation.Veig said: \"But why did you put it in there?\"\"Because wine is alive. The vibrations might confuse it.\"Simeon said: \"But a communicator can't kill.\"Niall said: \"I think this kind can.\"Veig was still unsatisfied. \"But why do you think so?\"For a moment Niall considered telling them about his experience in the tower,then dismissed the idea; it would take too long, and place too great a demand ontheir credulity. The internalizer had to be experienced to be understood.Instead he said: \"It's just a guess. That's why I'd like to see the body.\" Heasked Simeon: \"Will you come with me?\"\"Of course. But do you mind if I finish eating first? He won't get up and walkaway.\"\"I'm sorry.\" Niall had forgotten that Simeon was tired. \"Please don't hurry.\"Aware that he had sounded brusque, Simeon said: \"You haven't finished eatingeither.\"\"No, of course.\" Niall forced himself to eat a piece of buttered bread; but hisappetite had gone.As Veig and Simeon emptied the carafe of mead, he pretended to listen to theirconversation. But as his thoughts revolved around the pendant and the man withthe pointed head, he found himself wishing that he could talk to Dravig; it wasso much easier to communicate with an intelligent spider than with a humanbeing. The image of the man in the black robe was so vivid that he seemed to beable to see the bushy eyebrows, the pointed ears, the webbed fingers, and had toshake his head to disperse the illusion. A moment later he was staring at therising bubbles in the glass, and experiencing a curious passivity that was akinto hypnosis.There was a thunderous knocking that shocked him into attention; he started asif from sleep. A moment later he realized with astonishment that it had onlybeen the sound of Nephtys tapping at the door.She said: \"The Lord Dravig is here my lord.\"\"Good. Ask him to come in.\"Veig and Simeon clambered to their feet as Dravig entered the room; they weresufficiently conditioned to feel uncomfortable remaining seated in the presenceof a spider. Niall acknowledged the gesture of obeisance with an inclination ofhis head.\"I am glad to see you.\"Dravig said: \"I felt that you wanted to see me -- that is why I came.\"The other two resumed their seats. Aware that spiders had a distaste for thesight of human beings engaged in eating, Niall said: \"Let us go into the otherroom.\" He asked Nephtys: \"Please tell Jarita to bring more wine for my guests.\"The bedroom was illuminated by the clear light of the moon, which shone throughthe window, and by the red glow from the stove. Niall said: \"Simeon has told meabout the man's death. Do you know how it happened?\"\"No. But I suspect he was killed.\"\"So do I.\" For several moments neither of them spoke; since their minds wereopen to one another, there was no element of discomfort in the silence. ThenNiall said: \"Do you know this man?\"He accompanied the words with a mental image of the man in the black robe; itwas exactly as if he had shown Dravig a photograph.\"No. Who is he?\"\"The man who sent the killers.\"Dravig said: \"Then your own life is in danger.\" He had made this statement outof his total grasp of the situation, and again Niall experienced thesatisfaction of direct communication. He said: \"I know.\"\"You must take special precautions. I will send guards to stand outside yourpalace.\"\"Thank you.\" Niall disliked the idea, but he knew it was common sense. Anyonecould walk into the palace at any time. Until today he had felt totally secure.But the man who had been responsible for the death of two assassins was himselfan obvious target for assassination.Dravig said: \"I will go and attend to it now.\"\"Wait. There is something else I have to talk to you about. Did you know thatSkorbo was still killing and eating human beings?\"\"No!\" The force of Dravig's surprise made it evident that he was speaking thetruth.\"My brother tells me that many people knew about it, including Sidonia, thecommander of the Death Lord's guard.\"\"Then why did she not speak? She shall be punished.\"\"No. She is not to blame. Like the others, she assumed the Death Lord knew aboutit.\"\"That is absurd!\" Dravig was close to anger. \"The Death Lord gave you his word,and his word is sacred.\"\"I know that. But the human beings of this city do not yet understand it. Theymust be given time to learn.\"Dravig had already sensed the next thought that Niall was about to express.\"Was Skorbo the only one?\"\"No. I gather there were a number of others -- Skorbo's close associates.\"\"I know who they must be. Skorbo had his own special friends -- all came fromthe same region of Astigia, where the Black God of the Mountain is worshiped. Iwas told they were infidels, but I never believed it until now. They must bepunished.\"\"Is that wise?\" The spider expressed incomprehension. \"It might cause resentmentto punish spiders for killing human beings.\"\"It must be so. They have not only disobeyed the will of the Death Lord, but thewill of the goddess. That is an offense punishable by death.\"Niall was silent; he had no particular desire or reason to defend Skorbo'smurderous associates.Dravig sensed that the conversation was at an end. \"With your permission I willleave you.\"\"Wait. I'm coming with you.\"Nephtys was still keeping guard at the door; Niall told her to summon hischarioteers.\"Are we ready to go?\" Simeon rose to his feet.Niall turned to Dravig. \"I would like you to accompany us to the hospital.\" Withthe equivalent of a human nod, the spider transmitted his acquiescence.Simeon said: \"I think your brother had better come too. I'd like to do somethingabout that thumb.\"\"Is it still bleeding?\" He saw that the handkerchief around Veig's thumb wassoaked in blood. When Veig removed it, blood welled out of the clean cut. \"Whyisn't it clotting?\"Simeon said: \"My guess is that there was an anticoagulant on the blade. I've gota poultice that should cure it.\"Outside, it was a cold and brilliant night; the moon was almost directlyoverhead. As they stood waiting for the charioteers, Niall looked across thesquare to the house where Skorbo had been attacked. To his surprise, it was nolonger there; instead there was merely a gap. Dravig followed the direction ofhis gaze.\"It has been demolished. We regard a house where a murder has taken place asunholy ground.\"Niall asked: \"Did the workmen find the leaden seal?\"\"I have not been told of it. But I will make inquiries.\"Simeon, who had been able to hear Niall's part of the conversation, asked: \"Doyou think the seal is a transmitter?\"\"It's possible.\"The charioteers, muffled in furs, finally arrived. Niall climbed in, followed byVeig and Simeon.\"Take us to the hospital.\"Dravig followed the chariot, walking with long unhurried strides; even when thecharioteers were running, it cost him no effort to keep up with them.Niall looked at his brother, who was sitting between them, and then down at hisbandaged hand -- Jarita had provided a long strip of cloth.\"How do you feel?\"Veig grinned cheerfully. \"Fine.\" He held up his hand; the bandage was alreadystained with blood. \"It won't stop bleeding, but otherwise there's nothingwrong.\"But as the chariot bounced and jarred on the frozen snow, Niall observed hisbrother's face with concern; it seemed unnaturally pale, with a pallor that wasmore than an effect of the moonlight.The front door of the hospital building was closed, but opened when Niall pushedagainst it. Simeon led them down the dimly lighted corridor, which smelled ofchlorinated lime and medication. A woman in slave uniform looked out of adoorway, but blanched and hastily retreated when she saw the spider. The door ofthe maternity ward stood open, and they could hear the heavy breathing of awoman in labor. Simeon turned left at the end of the corridor, and halted infront of a plain wooden door. He shook his head in annoyance.\"I told them to leave someone on guard.\" He pushed open the door, then halted.\"Great goddess!\"Niall, who was directly behind him, found it difficult to see what had causedthe exclamation. The small oblong room, with its white-painted walls, was lit bya single rush lamp which burned in a corner alcove; white gowns hung on thewalls. Two benches stood in the center of the room, and a third against the rearwall. On this bench lay a corpse, its feet toward the door. It was only whenNiall looked more closely that he saw what had startled Simeon. The corpse hadno head. A moment later, Simeon was kneeling beside another corpse that laybetween the benches.Veig peered over Niall's shoulder. \"Who's that?\"\"The caretaker, Jude. Give me a knife.\"Even in the poor light, Niall could see that the dead man's face was swollen andsuffused with blood, and that the lips were drawn back from the teeth in agrimace of agony.Simeon was sawing with a knife in the region of the man's throat. He shook hishead. \"It's no good. The cord's tied so tight I'd have to cut his throat to getit off. He's dead anyway.\"Dravig had followed them into the room, although his enormous bulk almost filledit. He stood looking down at the headless corpse. \"This is the man who died thisafternoon.\"Niall said: \"I know.\" He was looking at the cut on the forearm made by thepoisoned knife.Simeon said: \"They've taken the other body.\"Niall asked: \"Are you sure it arrived?\"\"Certain. I watched them carry it in before I came to see you.\"Veig voiced the thought that was in Niall's mind. \"Perhaps he wasn't dead afterall.\"Simeon said: \"He was dead all right. I'd stake my life on that.\"Niall lit a second rush light from the one in the corner, and held it near thefloor.\"Look. Someone carried the head out of the door.\" There were splashes of driedblood on the wooden floor.Simeon said: \"Which means there were at least three of them.\"Veig asked: \"Why three?\"\"A man carrying a severed head holds it by the hair, and he holds it away fromhimself to avoid the blood. That's what happened here. So there must have beenthree -- two to carry the body, one to carry the head.\"\"But why should they want the head?\"Niall was in the corridor, bent close to the floor. The trail of blood randiagonally across it to another door. When he opened this he found himselflooking into a small yard enclosed by a high wall; it was clearly illuminated bythe moon, which was directly overhead. Against this wall lay a pile of choppedlogs, and the snow between the door and the logs had been trampled by many feet.But the trail of blood ran across the yard, and out of a rusty iron gate, whichstood slightly ajar. The snow in this part of the yard was still deep anduntrampled. It showed clearly the single line of footprints that accompanied thetrail of blood.Niall pointed. \"Only one man.\"Simeon shook his head. \"That's unbelievable. Unless a dead man can walk.\"Veig said: \"Or unless he was still alive.\"Simeon said: \"He certainly looked dead.\" But his tone of voice indicated that hewas beginning to experience doubts.Outside the gate, the blood trail ceased. The snow here had been trampled, andwas too hard to show footprints.Niall said: \"He must have realized he was -- leaving a trail.\"Veig said: \"But how could he stop it bleeding?\"Simeon grunted. \"Turn it upside down and tuck it under his arm.\"The moonlit street was empty, although lights burned in some of the buildings.Veig had dropped onto his knees and was studying the snow; Niall knew him wellenough to know that his hunting instinct had been aroused. But after severalminutes, he stood up, shaking his head. He pointed down the street.\"I'd guess he went that way. But only because I think he wouldn't risk goingback to the main avenue.\"Dravig asked: \"Shall I summon the guard?\"Since the others were unable to hear the question, Niall repeated it aloud.Simeon shook his head. \"If he knew he was being followed, he'd hide in thenearest empty building, and we might never find him.\"Veig was already walking along the street, away from the main avenue, his eyeson the ground; Niall recognized in the bent shoulders the total concentration ofthe hunter. He was attempting to allow his intuition, like an animal's sense ofsmell, to guide him back to the trail. And as he watched his brother, Niallsuddenly became as fascinated by Veig's efforts as by their immediate objective;he recognized the peculiar \"inwardness\" that he himself knew so well, the innercontraction of the faculties that seemed to awaken some hidden power.Veig halted at the next intersection, a narrow street that was hardly more thanan alleyway. The moonlight caused the houses on the left to throw a sharp blackshadow. The snow here was untrampled; the only visible tracks were those of awolf spider. Yet Veig stood there, his head turning to right and left like atracker dog that has picked up the scent. Then he disappeared into the shadow ofthe building.\"Bring a lamp here.\"Niall carried his own lamp, which was shaded by a glass chimney, to the spotwhere Veig was standing. Veig took it from him and knelt. He gave an exclamationof satisfaction.\"This is it.\"He had, in fact, discovered a line of footprints that ran along the left-handpavement. Niall was about to ask how he could be so sure, then changed his mind.Veig, at least, seemed to have no doubts. He handed the lamp back to Niall, andhurried forward, his body bent almost double.A hundred yards further on, the alleyway joined the other main avenue that ranfrom east to west across the square. Common sense suggested that their quarryhad not turned east into the square, where his position would be completelyexposed, and the same reasoning suggested that he would avoid turning west intothe avenue. The alternative was to cross the avenue into the narrow street whichran down toward the river. Here again the snow had been trampled, so noindividual print could be distinguished. As they passed close to the rear of thehouse in which Skorbo had been attacked, Niall was struck by the thought thattheir quarry could have taken refuge in any one of a dozen empty buildings. YetVeig continued to hurry forward without hesitation, so that by the time hereached the embankment he was almost running.Niall was the first to see the fugitive. He was walking along the road, aboutfifty yards to their right, toward one of the smaller bridges that crossed theriver to the slave quarter. There could be no doubt about his identity; theobject he was carrying under his arm looked like a cabbage. Afraid to shout, incase he betrayed their presence, Niall flung up an arm and pointed. The man waswalking slowly, in a curiously stiff, doll-like manner, as if both legs weregiving him pain. A moment later, Niall felt the blast of will-force thatemanated from Dravig; it was so powerful that it made him wince. He expected tosee the man fall to the ground as if poleaxed. Yet, incredibly, he continued towalk, in the same stiff-legged manner, toward the center of the bridge. Dravigwas also incredulous; it was the first time in his life that a human being hadfailed to respond to a mental command. As they watched, the man halted andclimbed onto the parapet of the bridge. Again, Dravig hurled a thunderbolt ofwill-force that should have knocked him backward; it had no visible effect. Amoment later the man jumped; the wind carried the sound of the splash away fromthem.Dravig hesitated no longer; a few strides carried him to the embankment and overits low wall. A few seconds later Niall reached the spot, expecting to see theman struggling in the water, or in the grip of the spider's forelegs. Instead hesaw Dravig standing in the middle of the river -- which was about six feet deepat this point -- looking bewilderedly to right and left.They hurried down the steps that led from the embankment to the flagstoned pathbeside the river. The slow-flowing water was flat and calm, reflecting themoonlight; the only ripples were caused by Dravig himself.Veig said: \"He must be swimming underwater.\" But as they stared intently at thesmooth surface, it became clear that this was unlikely; no one could hold hisbreath that long.Dravig began to wade slowly downstream, and they followed, walking under theblack shadow of the bridge. As Dravig emerged from the shadow he halted, andsuddenly plunged under the water. A moment later he reappeared, holding the bodyof a man in his forelegs. In two strides he had regained the bank. Since thebody was upside down, and remained motionless, it seemed clear that the man waseither dead or unconscious. Then, as he landed with a thud on the flagstones, itbecame obvious that he was dead. The blank eyes gazed directly ahead and themouth gaped open like that of a fish; the right arm was still bent against hisside, as if holding the head; but the head itself had escaped.Simeon knelt beside him and touched one of his eyelids, then pinched the fleshof the cheek. When he looked up, his face was very pale.\"This man has been dead for hours.\"\"How can that be?\" Veig's voice sounded incredulous, almost angry.Simeon took hold of the left arm and tried to bend it. \"Look. Rigor mortis. Thatdoesn't set in for at least four hours after death.\"\"But we all saw him walking. Dead men can't walk.\"\"Can you think of any other explanation?\"Niall also touched the cheek; it was like cold rubber. There was somethingrepulsive about the face; it was flabby, with a receding double chin and athick, sensual mouth; the nose was like a pig's snout. Controlling his aversion,Niall tore open the tunic, exposing the white, hairless chest. He pointed to thependant, which lay against the base of the throat.\"That's what killed him.\"Simeon asked: \"How can you be so sure?\"\"Look.\" Niall pointed to the circular red spot above the heart; it was about aninch in diameter and might have been a burn mark. Then he took hold of thependant and extended it on its chain; it covered the red mark precisely. \"That'swhy he died of a heart attack.\"Simeon's hand went up to his own chest. \"Great goddess; I've been wearing one ofthose things all afternoon. . .\"Niall said: \"But he had no reason to kill you. On the contrary, it would havegiven him away.\"Veig said: \"But who is 'he'?\"\"I don't know his name. But he's some kind of magician. Only a magician couldmake the dead walk. . .\" Niall's voice trailed off as he spoke the last words;it was as if he felt that even speaking them aloud was dangerous.Simeon removed the pendant from around the man's neck, and handed it to Niall.\"Now at least he'll stay dead.\" As soon as Niall's head touched the pillow, he fell into a deep and dreamlesssleep. Yet when he woke, two hours later, it was as if struggling out of anightmare. He immediately experienced a strong conviction that there was someoneelse in the room. He raised his head and listened; there was no sound but thewind, which howled against the corner of the building. He reached out cautiouslyto the lamp that burned in an alcove above the bed, and turned up the wick. Theyellow flame revealed that the room was empty. Yet when he stilled his senses,retreating to the silent place inside himself, he still experienced the feelingthat he was being watched.He sat up in bed and took the lamp from the wall. Then, walking silently on barefeet, he went into the next room. Yet even as he tiptoed across the floor, hefelt that these precautions were absurd. It was as if the watcher was lookingdown on him from above, or from some direction beyond the reach of his senses.The glass containing the mead stood on the table. Now it contained two pendants,one taken from Simeon, the other from the corpse by the river. As soon as he sawthem, Niall knew he had made a mistake to put them together. Now each onereinforced the power of the other, creating a living force field that was awareof everything that moved within its radius.He reached out his hand toward the glass, then snatched it away; it was liketrying to reach out to a striking snake. In fact, the pendants with theirintertwined chains seemed to be two snakes with their coils intertwined; he feltthey were daring him to reach out and touch them.For a moment Niall considered taking them to the white tower, where they couldbe rendered harmless by the electromagnetic field of the Steegmaster. Thethought of the freezing wind deterred him. Then he was struck by anotherpossibility. In the basement below the hall, there were a number of stone jarsmade of some black, granitelike substance; they were so heavy that no one hadever attempted to move them. No one seemed to know what they had been used for.But one day the children had discovered that they possessed a peculiar property:pins, needles, and small iron ornaments stuck to them so firmly they weredifficult to remove. Simeon told him they had been carved from an ore namedmagnetite.With an effort that cost all his power of self-discipline, Niall reached out andpicked up the glass. It was hard to dismiss the idea that the two pendants werealive and about to rear up and crawl over the sides. A few seconds later, hishand began to tingle with a sensation like pins and needles. Carrying the lampin his other hand, he went out into the corridor and down the stairs. In thehall, the air was warm, and red embers still burned in the grate. But as hecrossed to the door that led to the basement, the pins and needles turned into anumbing sensation, so that he felt he had to grip the glass more tightly toavoid dropping it.At that moment he became aware that the force field of the glass was beingreinforced from elsewhere; somewhere out in the city, an even more powerfulfield was joining its energy to theirs. At the same time, he seemed to besurrounded by a dull gray light that made everything unreal. The flame of thelamp was no longer necessary; the light seemed to illuminate the room like thefirst gray mist of dawn. The sound of his own footsteps seemed very far away. Ashe pushed open the door into the basement, he realized he was sweating, and thathis teeth were chattering. He was seized by an overwhelming desire to put downthe glass and run away; the presence that had been watching him now seemed sostrong that he expected it to materialize.He was aware that the watcher was exerting all his force to make him losecontrol. If all this had happened a year ago, it would have succeeded. Butcontact with the spiders had taught Niall something of the use of his own willpower, and of the hidden force in the depths of his being. Now, as he bracedhimself to resist, the danger of panic receded, as if the watcher recognizedthat his self-control refused to be undermined.He hurried on down the stairs to the basement. This was a great stone-flaggedroom that had once been a wine cellar; a few months ago it had been full ofrusty wine racks and broken bottles. Now it was used as a storeroom for food; itsmelled of preserved smoked meat and spices. Along the rear wall stood six blackstone jars, each about three feet tall, and carved out of a veined stone whosesurface showed brown streaks of rust. Niall placed the glass and the lamp on theground, then used both hands to lift the cone-shaped plug in the neck of thenearest jar; it was so heavy that it made him gasp. He placed this on the floor,then, gritting his teeth, raised the glass and inverted its neck over the jar.The pendants fell into its depths with a faint metallic clink.The gray light immediately vanished, and he experienced a curious inner-shift offocus. At the same time, the numb sensation left his hand and forearm -- notslowly, like a limb to which circulation had been restored, but instantaneously,as if the numbness was some kind of delusion. The tension that had made histeeth chatter dissolved away, to be replaced by a relief that was so powerfulthat it seemed to drain him of strength. As he walked back upstairs, his legsached as if he had walked to the point of exhaustion, and he had to hold on tothe marble banister to support himself. By the time he was back in his room,waves of fatigue were making him walk like a drunken man. But as he threwhimself into bed, he noticed that the sensation of being watched haddisappeared; even the howling of the wind seemed friendly. As soon as he closedhis eyes, he fell into a heavy sleep. He woke up with a start, to find Jarita standing by the bed; sunlight slantedthrough the window. \"What time is it?\"\"Two hours after dawn.\"\"You shouldn't have let me sleep so late.\" He threw back the bedclothes.\"I looked in twice but you were sleeping deeply. And you have no Council meetingthis morning.\"\"Thank you, Jarita.\"He was hoping she would go, but she continued to stand by the bed. She wanted,he realized, to help him bathe and dress. This was one of the problems ofgetting up late. The underground cave in which Niall had spent his childhood andyouth had been extremely cramped; nevertheless, the men and women went toconsiderable lengths to preserve their modesty. Here in the Spider City, thefemale servants expected to help their masters to dress and undress; theyenjoyed anointing his body with scented oils, and even climbing into the bathwith him and administering a massage in the warm water. Veig openly reveled inall this attention, surrounding himself with attractive slaves. Niall alsoenjoyed being pampered, but he found that he preferred to be alone when hedressed; it seemed oddly pointless to allow someone else to help him put hisclothes on. This is why he liked to rise with the dawn. Now he realized thatJarita would regard it as a rejection if he declined her services. So he stoodthere passively, and allowed her to remove the knee-length tunic that he wore inbed, then fetch a bowl of warm water and sponge down his body. She did this withsuch obvious pride and pleasure that he found himself feeling guilty about hisimpatience.There was a knock at the door, and Nephtys looked in. Niall could tell she wassurprised to find Jarita there, and that Jarita herself was pleased to be foundkneeling at his feet.\"What is it?\" His embarrassment made him speak abruptly.\"The doctor is here, my lord.\"\"Tell him I'll be there in a moment.\"Simeon was already seated at table, drinking herb tea, when Niall came in; Niallmade a gesture to prevent him from rising. \"What brings you here so early?\"\"Your brother. His cut has been bleeding all night -- the comfrey poulticedidn't work. I've had to put in a couple of stitches.\"\"But it was only a small cut.\"\"That's what's so odd. There must have been a strong anticoagulant on the bladeof that ax. But even that shouldn't stop it from healing after twelve hours.Could I see the ax?\"Nephtys, who overheard the request, left the room, and returned a moment later,carrying the bundle wrapped in sacking.\"For heaven's sake be careful. It's very sharp.\"\"I can see that.\" Simeon studied the blade at close quarters, but made noattempt to touch it. \"No wonder it killed Skorbo. How do they make a blade assharp as that? And such superb metal. . .\"\"They obviously have a high level of culture.\"Simeon looked at him from under his bushy eyebrows. \"And do you have any ideawho 'they' are?\"\"Only what I can guess. Have you?\"\"I noticed one rather strange thing -- the skin of those dead men. It was toopale. I've only once seen skin as pale as that -- it was an old man who went madand locked himself in his room for twenty years.\"Niall said: \"As if they lived underground.\"\"That's right.\" Simeon glanced at him sharply. \"So you do know something aboutit?\"Niall shrugged. \"The Steegmaster told me of a legend of a race of men who cameto Earth from the stars, and who lived underground because the sunlight wasdeadly to them.\"\"Did he say where they lived?\"\"No. He thought it was just a story.\"Simeon shook his head. \"I'd swear that those men had lived underground, or beenkept in a dungeon.\"Jarita brought in another pot of herb tea; it was made from the leaves of aplant called delium, and diffused a delicate and delicious odor. The tea had afaintly astringent quality that seemed to sharpen the senses. As Jarita poured,she said: \"My lord, forgive me for interrupting, but the Lord Dravig is waitingto see you.\"\"But why is he waiting? Ask him to come in.\"\"I told him you were eating breakfast, and he said he would wait.\"Simeon looked uncomfortable. \"I'd better go.\"\"There would be no point. Dravig prefers to wait. Spiders have infinitepatience. He would only feel embarrassed if we allowed him to interrupt ourmeal.\"Simeon looked at him curiously. \"You seem to understand spiders very well.\"\"No. I understand a little. But I think it would be impossible for a human beingto understand all the subtleties of the spider mind. In some ways they know farmore than human beings.\"Simeon spread honey on a piece of hot crust. \"Do you suppose Dravig might knowwhere these people come from?\"\"I doubt it. He told me he had no idea of their identity.\"\"Yet it seems incredible that no one should know who they are or where theylive.\"Niall asked: \"What do you know of the land to the north of this city?\"\"Not much. It's said to be extremely dangerous. But, as you know, the servantsof the beetles were only recently granted freedom to go where they liked. Andvery few of them have been far from the city.\"\"What kinds of dangers?\"\"I've heard of a beetle that has a shell so tough that no weapon can penetrateit, and jaws that can bite through a steel spear. But I must admit I've nevermet anyone who's seen one.\"\"Not even the bombardier beetles?\"\"Oh no. They hate travel. They say that some of them have never even venturedoutside the city.\" He emptied his cup and replaced it on the table. \"I'd bettergo. Tell Veig to come and see me if he has any more problems.\"He and Niall clasped forearms; the old man's forearm was stringy and muscular.At the door, Simeon paused with one hand on the latch. \"There is one more thingI meant to ask you. Why do you think that creature chopped off the head, thentook it away?\"Niall smiled. \"For the same reason he took his own head away.\"Simeon frowned. \"His own head? But that was on his shoulders.\"\"Quite.\"\"Yes, but why did he want the head?\"Niall said: \"He didn't want it. He only wanted to get rid of it, so we couldn'tfind it. And if we hadn't caught him, both heads would now be at the bottom ofthe river.\"\"But what could we learn from a head?\"\"A head contains a brain. And a brain contains information.\"\"Not when it's dead it doesn't.\"\"You could be wrong. This man is a magician. He knows many secrets that we donot know. The only thing he does not know is how much we know. That is why hewanted to get rid of the heads.\"Simeon looked at him curiously. \"You seem to know a great deal.\"He was interrupted by Nephtys, who appeared in the open doorway. \"My lord, theLord Dravig. . .\"\"Yes, I know.\" Niall stood up. \"Tell him I'm coming now.\" He bowed inacknowledgment as Simeon withdrew. Jarita said: \"Your cloak, my lord.\"As he stood there, allowing her to fasten the soft gray cloak about his neck, henoticed that her hands lingered slightly longer than necessary -- and thatNephtys was also aware of it. And since he could see into the minds of bothwomen, he knew that Nephtys had been meant to notice. It disturbed him torealize that he was an object of a subtle rivalry between these two women, andthat by allowing Jarita to dress him, he had intensified the rivalry. So, whileJarita was still smoothing the cloak, he followed Simeon out of the room.Dravig was standing close to the fire, obviously enjoying its heat; as Niallappeared on the stairs he made the ritual gesture of obeisance. There was nogreeting exchanged between them -- because they were telepathic, spiders foundsuch human formalities incomprehensible. But since Niall was obliged to speakfirst he asked: \"What brings you here so early?\"\"The Death Lord requests your presence in his headquarters.\" (The imagetransmitted was, in fact, of a web.)\"Of course.\" He hoped that Dravig had not noticed his uncontrollable reaction ofdismay. Although he was, in theory, the lord of the Spider Lord, unpleasantimpressions of previous encounters lingered in his memory. As he crossed to thealcove in which he had left his outdoor cloak and fur boots, he asked casually:\"Do you know what it's about?\"\"He wishes you to be present at the trial of Skorbo's fellow criminals.\"This time Niall made no attempt to conceal his consternation. \"As a witnessagainst them?\"\"That is unnecessary. They have already confessed.\"\"Then why does he want me there?\"\"To witness that he always keeps his word.\"\"When does the trial take place?\"\"It will begin as soon as you appear.\"\"Oh dear, I'm sorry.\" But even as he pulled on his boots, he knew that Dravigfound his apology incomprehensible.Spider language had no equivalent of \"waiting.\" It would have been asinapplicable to a spider as to a tree.The sunlight made the air pleasantly warm, although the north wind still had anedge of coldness; the snow was already beginning to thaw. The square was full ofpeople, for today was a holiday -- a concept introduced from the city of thebombardier beetles, where men worked for six days and rested on the seventh. Assoon as Niall was recognized, people cleared a way for him, then fell on theirknees in the snow, bowing their heads. The fact that Niall was followed byDravig, who walked a few steps behind him -- as was required by protocol --obviously increased their respect. Once again Niall found himself wishing thathe could stroll among his own people without being recognized.As soon as he entered the headquarters of the Spider Lord, Niall became aware ofa brooding tension. It was, in fact, an altogether curious sensation, as ifwalking into a kind of cold jelly. This feeling was undoubtedly shared by everyspider in the building: a recognition that something of great seriousness wasabout to take place. In the days when human beings had been lords of the Earth,the same atmosphere had probably pervaded murder trials and public executions.Niall found himself stifled by a sense of oppression. In the dark hallway, heturned to Dravig. \"What would happen if I begged the Death Lord to spare theirlives?\"Dravig answered without hesitation: \"That would be inadvisable.\"\"You mean he would refuse?\"\"No. He would agree. But for the prisoners themselves it would be a shamefulhumiliation.\"Niall was astonished. \"Why?\"\"Because they would owe their lives to the intercession of one they regard as anenemy. They would prefer to die.\"Dravig now preceded him up the stairs. And, as he followed, Niall tried tounderstand this latest baffling paradox of the arachnoid mentality: that aspider should prefer death to the generosity of an \"enemy.\" Then, as he againbecame aware of the suffocating tension in the air, he suddenly understood.Unlike human beings, spiders were in constant telepathic contact. There would beno way in which a spider could forget or ignore the contempt of his fellows. Andthat contempt would cause him to see himself as an entirely contemptiblecreature, unworthy of life. . .The building was in almost complete darkness; every window was covered by athick layer of dust-laden cobwebs which had accumulated over the centuries. Somelong-dead Spider Lord had probably chosen this building as his headquartersbecause the great main staircase was built of black marble, and the walls werecovered with a substance like black volcanic glass. Spiders had an instinctivepreference for darkness -- no doubt because it was necessary for the concealmentof their webs.On the fourth floor, Dravig halted in front of a wide door covered with blackleather and decorated with brass studs. The two wolf spiders who stood on guardon either side were so still that they might have been statues. The same wastrue of the dark-haired girl who stood to attention in front of the door; shewas dressed in a black uniform, although her white arms had been left bare;Niall recognized her as Sidonia, the captain of the Spider Lord's householdguard. She looked at him without recognition -- the slightest wavering of hergaze would have been regarded as a severe breach of discipline -- then turnedher back on them and threw open the door.In the spacious hall beyond, there was enough light to reveal that the walls andceiling were entirely covered with dusty cobwebs. At the far end of the room,the cobwebs stretched from floor to ceiling, and were so thick that theyresembled layers of netting or a tangle of creepers. From the midst of thisjungle, Niall had a sensation of being surveyed by invisible eyes. As he came toa halt, the voice of the Spider Lord sounded inside his chest.\"Welcome, chosen of the goddess.\"Niall replied: \"I am honored to be in your presence, O lord of the Earth.\"As his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, Niall became aware of otherspiders standing by the walls; they were so still, and blended so well into thebackground, that they were virtually invisible. And then, quite suddenly, it wasunnecessary for him to try to penetrate the darkness; every spider in the roombecame clearly visible. For a moment he thought that a beam of sunlight hadpenetrated the dusty windows. Then, with a shock, he understood what hadhappened. The Spider Lord had integrated him into the web of awareness withinthe room. He had been granted the supreme honor of becoming a part of thegeneral consciousness that united all spiders.It was, in a sense, the most remarkable experience of his life. Like all humanbeings, Niall had spent his whole life seeing things from his individualstandpoint, like a man sitting alone in a small room; even when closest toothers he felt aware of his solitariness. He had taken it for granted that thiswas what it meant to be alive. Now, suddenly, he was no longer alone; he was apart of a network of other beings, as aware of their existence as he was of hisown. The bewildering thing was that his sense of identity had vanished; he hadbecome the spiders who surrounded him, while his own identity had somehow becomedivided among them. Yet when he looked inside himself, wondering at this loss ofindividuality, he realized with surprise that his identity was still there, asit always had been. It was his sense of being himself, of being Niall, that haddisappeared. And now he understood that this had always been an illusion, thathe had never been Niall. Niall was merely a set of misconceptions.All this, he realized, was an act of supreme courtesy on the part of the SpiderLord, an attempt to make amends for centuries of mistrust between spiders andhuman beings. And since spiders have a natural aversion to human beings, just asmost human beings have a natural aversion to spiders, this gesture ofintegration into spider consciousness was also an act of extraordinarygenerosity. The generosity was all the more astounding since Niall could nowunderstand why spiders found humans so distasteful; with their cramped littleegos, their obsessive self-preoccupation, they must all seem to be sufferingfrom a kind of insanity. Now he could also see why spiders had felt no guiltabout treating human beings as slaves; with their blindness and narrowness, menwere only one degree less stupid than sheep.Yet although his new awareness allowed him to blend into the consciousness ofthe spiders, so that he himself became a kind of honorary spider, he was alsoaware that all the spiders possessed their own individual consciousness, so thatthe contents of their minds were hidden from him, just as his were hidden fromthem. He could betray his thoughts to them, by allowing them to \"overflow,\" butif he chose to minimize his thought energy, then there was no way in which theycould invade the privacy of his mind.Now, as he stood in silence before the web of the Spider Lord, he understood theproverb quoted by Dravig as the essence of spider wisdom: \"Silence allows Timeto hear its own voice.\" Because they were directly aware of one another'sexistence, spiders felt perfectly at home in silence; this was why they couldremain silent and motionless for days or weeks at a time. This, he alsorealized, was why spiders lived so long: the silence allowed them time to renewthemselves. While he had been trapped in his own identity, Niall had feltawkward and self-conscious to be standing alone in the middle of the room; nowhe felt that he could easily stand there for a year without fatigue.As his attention shifted from the strangeness of his new awareness to the roomaround him, Niall became conscious of the situation in which he found himself.The web that covered the end of the room like a dark tunnel now seemedtransparent, and he recognized for the first time that it was the equivalent ofa royal throne, in which the Spider Lord sat surrounded by her courtiers, theruling council of the spider city; each of these councilors -- all were female-- had her precise place. The only other occupants of the room, besides himselfand Dravig, were six male spiders, who were ranged on either side of the room;these, he now realized, were the prisoners on trial.As soon as his attention was fixed on them, he was aware that five of the sixwere nonentities, the spider equivalent of foot soldiers. The leading spirit wasthe sixth, a captain of the guard who had been Skorbo's closest friend. Thisspider was smaller and more compact than the others, although his powerful legsand pincers revealed enormous physical strength. Niall was surprised to realizethat this spider, like the others, was nameless -- for names would have beenpointless when spiders had instant telepathic recognition. If one of them wishedto refer to a spider who was absent, he could convey a mental image of thespider's essential identity. Names such as Skorbo and Dravig had been bestowedon prominent spiders by human beings.And now that his attention was focused on the sixth spider, Niall alsorecognized that a name would have been an absurdity. This spider had come from adistant province across the sea, and he had been born into a privilegedposition, a member of a family whose natural dominance ensured them a certainpreeminence. Here, in the spider city, his natural dominance aroused resentment,while his small stature led to him being regarded with a certain lack ofrespect. And since spiders attached immense importance to being respected, thishad engendered a certain rebelliousness.Skorbo, by comparison, had been coarse and stupid; but he also possessed a highdegree of natural dominance, so the two had formed a kind of alliance. Skorbohad never understood his companion's rebelliousness, for he himself was a bornsoldier who regarded obedience as a law of nature; but he admired this\"aristocrat\" among spiders.As members of the imperial guard, these two had never given cause for complaint;but when they were off duty, they took pleasure in hunting and tormenting humanbeings. They were not interested in those who were merely fat and succulent, butonly in those who possessed a certain strength and enterprise, some degree ofleadership quality. These they observed with infinite patience, studying theirmovements, waiting until the opportunity came to plunge down on them from thesky and seize the victim in all eight legs. This generated an almost feverishintensity of pleasure. The victim's vocal chords were paralyzed so that he couldnot cry out, but his limbs were left unaffected, for the essence of the pleasurelay in his struggles. To feel a terrified captive squirming frantically produceda delight that in human beings is associated only with sex. Then he would betaken to a lighted room, and allowed to try to escape. One man had evensucceeded in leaping out of an upper window, hoping to kill himself; but Skorbohad been crouching in his web, and had caught him before he struck the pavement.(Spiders were able to increase or decrease their speed of descent at will.) Thevictim had then been tormented for hours until he had died of terror andexhaustion. His body had been eaten while still warm.All this Niall knew instantaneously on looking at the guard captain, for it hadalready been confessed, and was therefore in the minds of his companions. Hecould also understand why, when the Spider Lord had announced the peace treatybetween spiders and human beings, Skorbo and his companion had been so shockedand outraged. They were being deprived of a pleasure that had become the keenestand sweetest sensation in life, something that meant more to them than food anddrink. Yet Skorbo was willing to accept the new state of affairs; since it wasthe will of the goddess, he could see no alternative. It was his companion whorebelled at the idea. Although he too was willing to respect the will of thegoddess, the notion of treating human beings as equals filled him with fury andcontempt. Humans were vermin, obviously intended by Nature to be the prey ofspiders. If the goddess had allowed them to go on killing human beings forcenturies, it was surely unlikely that she would suddenly change her mind. No,this new prohibition was obviously the decision of the old Spider Lord, who wasimpotent and senile. It deserved to be flouted.In any case, there was no hurry about deciding what to do. Their private larderwas well stocked with human flesh. A death spider could inject his prey with apoison that would paralyze the central nervous system without causing death; ifprecisely the right quantity was injected, the victim might live for six monthswithout being able to move a finger or an eyelid. So Skorbo and his companioncontinued to dine on human flesh for many months after the peace treaty withoutfeeling that they were breaking the law. Then five NCOs of the imperial guarddiscovered a forgotten communal larder containing a dozen or so paralyzed humancarcasses, as well as some cows and pigs. These were transferred to Skorbo'slarder, and the NCOs joined in the nightly feasts. One night, an NCO broughtback the body of a slave who had collapsed during an epileptic attack, and theyall agreed that the fresh meat tasted so delicious that it would be absurd toforgo the pleasure of eating the occasional slave -- besides, no one reallyregarded slaves as human. But then, human beings from across the river oftenwandered around the slave quarter at night, and it was quite impossible to knowwhich was which. And so, step by step, without any intention of breaking thelaw, Skorbo and his companions had drifted back into the habit of eating liveflesh. . .All these facts were communicated to Niall's mind within a few moments of theSpider Lord's greeting; it was unnecessary for them to be communicated serially,one by one, for they existed simultaneously, in the mind of the Spider Lord andof every other spider in this room. But he was also aware that the mostimportant part of the interrogation was still to come -- a part that, althoughpurely formal, was still essential to the process of justice.First of all there was a lengthy silence -- the silence spiders believed shouldprecede all affairs of importance. As Niall relaxed in this silence, heexperienced an almost electrical sensation of delight. The last time he hadexperienced this sensation was when he and Veig, and their cousin Hrolf, wereexploring the country of the ants, and had encountered a shallow stream thatmeandered in its rocky bed. For the first time in his life, Niall had immersedhimself in water, and then had sat there, staring at the rippling surface, withthis same sensation of peaceful ecstasy.The Spider Lord finally spoke, addressing the prisoners: \"You are aware that youhave broken the law, and flouted the will of the goddess. What do you have tosay for yourselves?\"The accused made no reply. The five NCOs were obviously too ashamed to speak;the captain simply maintained silence.The Spider Lord said: \"Is there any reason why I should not pass the sentence ofdeath?\"After another silence, the captain replied: \"I would regard the death sentenceas an injustice.\"\"Why?\"\"Because the fault was unintentional. We began by eating humans who had alreadybeen destroyed.\" (The spider thought-language made no distinction between\"paralyzed\" and \"destroyed.\")\"We realize that. But you then went on to break the law by killing those who hadnot yet been destroyed.\"\"It is true that I broke your law. But it was not the law of my own country, theland of Koresh.\"At this point, Dravig intervened. \"You are in this country, not in Koresh, andare therefore obliged to obey our laws. Are you trying to deny this?\" Dravig'svoice had a note of anger.The captain's reply sounded cool and unemotional. \"I do not deny it. But Isubmit that this particular law is unfair.\"\"Why?\" The Spider Lord's voice also betrayed a note of anger.\"I am a stranger in your land. You have no right to ask me to treat human beingsas equals. I do not regard them as equals. Moreover, I do not believe you regardthem as equals.\"Niall was suddenly struck by an astonishing insight. Spider justice differedfrom human justice in one basic respect. A spider could not be sentenced todeath against his will. If he was to be executed, it had to be with his owntotal consent. The reason was obvious. If a spider was executed against hiswill, every other spider in the city would be aware of his misery and agony.Therefore, it was necessary for a spider to be convinced of his own guilt, andto consent to his own execution. The captain, apparently, was determined not todie. This, Niall now realized, was why Dravig and the Spider Lord were becomingangry.But when the Spider Lord replied, it was with remarkable restraint. \"All that isirrelevant. I gave my word that there should be peace between spiders and humanbeings. You have caused that promise to be broken. Therefore you deserve todie.\"This argument was obviously irrefutable; in effect, the captain had now beendriven into a corner. Surely he would at last concede the justice of thesentence?\"I agree that I have been the cause of your promise being broken. But I arguethat there are extenuating circumstances.\"The Spider Lord addressed the other five prisoners. \"Do you agree that youdeserve to die?\"All five made a gesture that signified assent.The Spider Lord asked: \"Well?\"\"I see no reason why my life should be sacrificed to the will of cowards.\"The Spider Lord suddenly lost patience. \"That is enough! I am tired of yourequivocations! You have deserved death a thousand times. Bow your head!\"This last sentence -- it could also have been translated \"Subordinate your will\"or \"Prepare to die\" -- was spoken in a tone of such menace that the roomsuddenly seemed to darken. The five NCOs obeyed immediately and abjectly, as ifbowing their heads to the executioner's ax. But the captain, although he knewhimself to be in an impossible situation, continued to radiate defiance. TheSpider Lord and Dravig struck at once with a force that made Niall cringe; ahuman being would have been squashed like a fly. The captain collapsed to theground, and lay there, his legs drawn around him in a tight knot; at the sametime, his will also collapsed into a defensive posture, surrounding him with ashield of invisible force. The combined strength of Dravig and the Death Lordstruck this shield with a force that should have smashed it and crushed thespider underneath it. In fact, it rebounded onto the other five spiders, killingthem instantly. There was a crunching sound, and the air was suddenly full ofthe peculiar pungent odor of spider blood.Niall felt them die. It was a strange sensation, as if time had suddenly goneinto slow motion. His brain was flooded with information -- so much informationthat it was impossible to absorb it, or even grasp its nature. Nevertheless, heknew intuitively what was happening: that in the moment of instantaneousextinction, the spiders were reliving their own lives. The experience wascuriously exciting, and completely devoid of the terror he had expected to beassociated with death. Then, what seemed to be several minutes later, there wasonly darkness and a sensation of emptiness.The captain was still lying there, surrounded by his defensive shield; it wasobvious that he had no intention of dropping his guard. All his will wasconcentrated upon a single purpose: to save his own life. In the pause thatfollowed, the Spider Lord regarded him with angry contempt; he found itunbelievable that any spider should prefer ignominy and disgrace to an honorabledeath. Then he summoned the others to join with him in the work of destruction.This meant that he and his ruling council would cease to act as individuals, butwould unite their efforts in a common purpose. This stratagem -- known to thebeetle servants as multiple-reinforcement interaction -- could be compared tothe decision of a group who had been trying to batter down a door by individualefforts to unite their strength behind a battering ram.The captain sensed what was about to happen, and his fear was so powerful thatit overwhelmed the bitter stench of blood. Yet even his terror had an element ofcalculation. Since its vibrations were being carried simultaneously to everyspider in the city, they had all become witnesses of this attempt to destroyhim. He was like a man screaming at the top of his lungs in order to mitigatethe severity of a beating. But as the multiple reinforcement mechanism began tooperate, the terror became muted as it gave way to a grim determination tosurvive. Niall watched with sickened fascination as the captain exerted all hisown will power in an attempt to preserve his life for a few moments longer. Hecould understand that terror of sudden extinction -- as could every spider inthe city. The interlinked will power of the spiders was like some giantnutcracker; it seemed impossible that any living creature could withstand suchforce. Even the corpses of the other spiders were caught in the mesh of power,so they began to crack and crumble, while their blood ran over the floor likewater squeezed from a sponge. The captain's mind was also cracking under thepressure, and Niall experienced again the sense of being overwhelmed withinformation -- that curious flood of images that seemed to accompany theconviction of approaching death. The most vivid of these was of a square, graybuilding surrounded by rich vegetation, including red and yellow tropicalflowers. But the inside smelled like a butcher's shop, and from the beams thatsupported the ceiling, a number of human bodies cocooned in spider silk swunglike pendulums in the breeze.It was as the blood began to run around his own feet that Niall suddenlyunderstood why this united will-force had not yet destroyed the captain'sresistance. It was because he, Niall, was present in the room, therebyinhibiting the Spider Lord from exerting the power that could overwhelmresistance through brute force. Such an explosion of power might well havecracked the walls of the room in which they were standing; it would certainlyhave squeezed the life out of Niall at the same time as it destroyed thecaptain. There was only one way in which Niall could cease to be an obstruction:by uniting his own will with that of the Spider Lord, so that his will became apart of the web of power. Yet even as this thought occurred to him, he was awarethat it was out of the question. He was a human being, not a spider. The captainmight be a sadistic coward who enjoyed torturing Niall's fellow humans; butNiall had no personal quarrel with him. If he took part in this execution, hewould be somehow forfeiting his own humanity.The struggle seemed to continue for a long time; in fact, it might have beenminutes, or even seconds. At a certain point, it became clear that the captainhad won his fight for life. Without Niall's participation, he could not bedestroyed. At that moment, the Spider Lord suddenly released his grip; Dravigand the others did so at the same time. The result was that the captain spunacross the room like a projectile, narrowly missing Niall's legs, and crashedinto the wall. The force of the impact was enough to deprive him of his senses.But instead of taking advantage of his helplessness, the Spider Lord merelyregarded him with contempt. Several minutes passed as the prostrate spiderstirred; then, as if knowing the danger was past, he struggled slowly to hisfeet.When the Spider Lord spoke, his voice was cold and detached. \"You will leavethis city immediately and never return. But you will not be allowed to return bysea to your own land. No ship will carry a traitor who prefers dishonor todeath. Now go.\"The spider dragged himself toward the door, every movement revealing a deadlyfatigue. In this state, a child could have killed him.The voice of the Spider Lord followed him. \"You are now an outlaw, and allcreatures are licensed to kill you. You must find your way back to your own landas best you can.\"The door swung open; Sidonia was standing on the other side. When the exhaustedspider had crawled past her, she closed it again.The Spider Lord now addressed Niall. \"You have chosen to spare his life. Thatwas your own decision, and I accept it. But the debt is now discharged.\"The implication was that, since Niall had spared the captain's life, he shouldnot complain if more human beings were killed. Niall signified his understandingby making a deep bow. The gesture was intended as a kind of apology, and theSpider Lord understood it as such. Then, followed by Dravig, Niall made his wayto the door, walking cautiously to avoid slipping in the blood. Activated bysome command that was beyond the range of Niall's perceptions, Sidonia openedthe door again, then closed it behind them. It was a relief to be in the cleanair. The stench of dead spiders had brought Niall to the verge of beingviolently sick.Sidonia was standing to attention, her face as blank as a doll's; theshoulder-length blonde hair and the pink cheeks reinforced this impression. Butbehind the immobility, Niall could sense her nervousness as he stood looking ather.\"Sidonia, I want to talk to you.\"Her color deepened as he spoke; otherwise she gave no sign of having heard. Hesaid: \"I'd like you to come with me.\"As she followed him down the stairs he could sense her puzzlement; she couldimagine no reason why he should want to talk to her, unless he found herattractive, and harbored the same desires as his brother. Dravig was alsopuzzled, but was too polite to attempt to read Niall's thoughts.Outside, the sunlight seemed dazzling. On the northern side of the square, hecould see the captain moving down the main avenue toward the bridge that led tothe slave quarter. Although his movements still betrayed fatigue, he wastraveling swiftly, apparently determined to leave the city before someone tookadvantage of the license to kill.Niall sat down on the sun-warmed balustrade, and gestured for Sidonia to take aseat beside him. She sat down awkwardly, as if it made her uncomfortable tocease to stand to attention. Dravig waited impassively; spiders had an oddability to freeze, as if turned into statues.Niall asked: \"How well do you know this city?\"\"Very well, I think.\" She spoke in the clipped voice of one accustomed to givingcommands.\"Do you know of a square, gray building, surrounded by green bushes and red andyellow flowers?\" He reinforced the question with a telepathic image.She looked down at the pavement, biting her lip, then shook her head. \"No,lord.\"Niall could see she was telling the truth; yet he could also sense an element ofdoubt. Something about the image aroused a sense of familiarity.\"Are you quite sure?\"She flushed, thinking that he was doubting her word. Because she was soaccustomed to spiders probing her mind, she had no idea that her privacy wasbeing invaded.\"Yes, lord.\"\"But have you any idea where it might be?\"She frowned. \"There are many flowers in that part of the city.\" She raised herhand and pointed to the east, along the avenue that ran past Niall's palace.\"How far?\"\"Perhaps two or three miles.\"Niall turned to Dravig.\"Do you know that part of the city?\"\"No. My business has never taken me there. It is quite deserted.\"\"Why is it deserted?\"\"Because it is not suitable for human habitation.\"\"I would like to go there. Will you come with me?\"The spider made a gesture of acquiescence. Niall turned back to Sidonia. \"Iwould also like you to accompany me. Please come to the palace at two o'clockthis afternoon.\" The sun now shone from a clear blue sky; the only unmelted snow lay in theshadows of trees and buildings, and the air was full of the rippling sound ofwater as it ran along the gutters and down the drains. The heat on their backswas so great that Niall and Simeon removed their cloaks and carried them overtheir arms; only Sidonia preferred the discomfort of the sun to the indignity ofbeing improperly dressed. Dravig, as usual, seemed indifferent to thetemperature.Around his neck, Niall was wearing the thought mirror that had been presented tohim on his first visit to the white tower. This was a device for coordinatingvibrations from the brain, the heart, and the solar plexus, producing aconcentration that intensified the perceptions. Since becoming ruler, Niall hadlost the habit of using it; he found that it heightened the powers of the willat the expense of intuition. Today he was wearing it for a special purpose. Onthat first visit to the tower, he had used the thought mirror to enable him tomemorize the map of the city. It had imprinted the map so powerfully on hismemory circuits that now, with its aid, he was able to study it in detail merelyby half-closing his eyes. The map showed the eastern part of the city extendingto the lower slopes of the circle of hills that enclosed the spider city. But alarge area was marked with the words \"Industrial Estate,\" a description thatNiall found baffling, and upon which neither Simeon nor Dravig was able to throwany light. He was aware that industry meant the production and manufacture ofgoods, and his history lessons in the white tower had included the story of theIndustrial Revolution; but in the part of the city they were now approaching, hecould see no sign of soot-blackened factories or tall chimneys. The buildingsseemed, if anything, to be lower than in the central part of the city.The sandstone-colored road along which they were walking looked as new as if ithad been built yesterday. In the second half of the twenty-first century, tarmacand concrete had given way to a compound of stone dust and plastic that hardenedinto a substance not unlike marble, but twice as durable. This is why the road,and the pavements on either side of it, showed no sign of wear. The houses,shops, and office buildings in this part of the city had also been built of newcompounds, so that they were in a far better state of repair than those in thecenter. The total effect was neat and orderly, but oddly dreary.A mile further on, commercial buildings gave way to small identical dwellinghouses built of red brick, each standing in its own small garden. These had oncebeen saved from monotony only by the elaborate patterns surrounding windows anddoorways; now the gardens had turned into tangles of overgrown vegetation thatsometimes covered the roofs; in one case, a tree had grown up through the centerof the house, so its trunk had pushed its way through the slates, and itsbranches overshadowed the roof. Niall experienced an intense curiosity toexplore one of these houses, to see whether their former inhabitants had leftbehind evidence about their daily lives; but he knew that only a few more hoursof daylight remained.After another mile or so, the scenery again changed dramatically. The first signof this was a profusion of bright color which began half a mile ahead where thered brick houses left off. According to the map, this was the beginning of theindustrial estate; but the buildings looked as if they had been designed for acarnival or recreation park. They were built of brightly colored bricks, many ofthem triangular or circular, and none of them was more than two stories high;the favorite color of the roofing tiles was a mottled shade of emerald green.Like the red brick houses, these were overgrown with vegetation; but thisvegetation had a tropical luxuriance. The main plant was a kind of thickcreeper, whose broad, glossy leaves were marbled with green and yellow, whilethe flowers were trumpet-shaped cups of scarlet. A smaller plant also had brightgreen leaves, round and glossy, and bright blue flowers. Palm trees, such asNiall had seen in the Delta, pushed their way above this mass of vegetation. Thetotal effect was one of strange extravagance, as if it had been designed by ajoker.As they came closer, it became clear that the scent of the plants was asdelightful as their appearance, a blend of honeysuckle, lilac, roses, gorse, andhyacinth, all overlaid by a rich odor resembling new-mown hay. The last timeNiall had encountered such a complexity of sweet scents was in the Delta, andthe recollection made him nervous. But when Sidonia strolled among the bushesand creepers, burying her face in the flowers with obvious pleasure, Niall alsosuccumbed to the temptation, and found the odors delicious. He asked Sidonia:\"Have you been here before?\"\"Yes.\" He thought she cast a nervous glance at Dravig.\"And is it always like this?\"She hesitated. \"I think so.\"\"Then why doesn't everyone come here? It's beautiful.\"\"Because. . .\" She was taking a deep breath of one of the scarlet trumpets:\"Because it is not good to have too much pleasure.\"As he looked at her with astonishment, she blushed. But her reaction broughtunderstanding. She was a soldier who took pride in discipline and self-control.These scents aroused a disturbing desire to surrender. And such an attitudewould have been regarded with displeasure by the spiders.Simeon was also studying the plants, but with the detached eye of an herbalist.Niall asked: \"Why do they grow like this in midwinter? Does the sunshine makethem think that it's spring?\"Simeon made a gesture of bewilderment. \"I don't know. I've never come acrossanything like it before.\"\"Not even in the Delta?\"\"That's different. Most of the plants in the Delta contained some kind of trap.\"\"And you're sure these don't?\"\"Oh no.\" It was Sidonia who spoke; her voice had a dreamy tone, and she wascaressing the scarlet trumpet as though it were a pet animal. \"This is not atrap.\"Niall removed the thought mirror from around his neck -- it focused hisattention too sharply -- and saw immediately that she was right. There wassomething curiously innocent and joyful about this profusion of odors. Hisintuition told him there was nothing to fear.\"Have you ever seen plants that bloom in midwinter?\"\"Not like this.\" Simeon was studying one of the thick, glossy leaves. \"Younotice the leaves are evergreen.\" He felt the petal of an orange flower thatmight have been an unknown variety of rose. Niall did the same, and observedthat it was thick and fleshy. \"And this flower could probably remain intact in agale.\"Niall asked Dravig: \"Do you know anything about them?\"\"My people have no interest in flowers.\" The reply carried an overtone ofamusement; Niall had observed before that Dravig possessed a dry sense of humor.Simeon said: \"Surely it can't be a coincidence that they planted these flowersamong these buildings?\"The same thought had struck Niall at the same moment. At close quarters, thebuildings looked as if they had been constructed for a child's playground; theirbright colors and elaborate patterns produced that same curious upsurge ofdelight.\"Perhaps this was the nursery of the industrial estate.\"\"Industrial estate? Is this an industrial estate?\"\"According to the map.\"Simeon nodded slowly. \"That explains it. They used to build them like this inthe old days. The workers got depressed if their surroundings were boring anddull. But as soon as they made the surroundings attractive, everyone workedharder. My grandfather read about it in books on history.\"\"But that doesn't explain flowers that bloom in winter.\"\"No.\" Simeon took a deep breath of a great golden flower like a giantsnapdragon. \"I agree that's odd.\"Sidonia said: \"Perhaps they brought these plants from the Delta,\"Niall said: \"The Delta didn't exist in those days.\"\"No?\" It was obvious that she knew no history.A light breeze rustled the bushes, mingling the scents so that they becamealmost overpoweringly sweet; they produced a shimmering, swooning sensation thatmade him want to lie down on the damp grass and close his eyes. With an effort,he replaced the thought mirror round his neck. The dreamy sensation vanishedinstantly, to be replaced by a hard sense of clarity that seemed almost brutalin comparison. The feeling of joyousness also vanished, swept away by the senseof concentrated will power, a desire to hurl himself into practical activity.\"It's getting late. We ought to move on.\"Simeon turned his back on the flowers with a sigh. But Sidonia pulled back hershoulders, thrust out her breasts, and followed him with a firm, purposefulstride.Simeon's account of the industrial estate was obviously correct. All thebuildings had the same deliberate gaiety, which at times approached vulgarity.Niall could imagine it as it was when originally built; with its smooth lawns,and colored buildings surrounded by bright flowers, it must have looked like apiece of fairyland. Simeon pointed out one curious structure, built entirely ofgreen stone, that looked like some unknown species of cactus pushing its way outof the rich soil.Niall shook his head. \"But surely they got bored with it after a day or so?Everyone gets used to the same surroundings sooner or later.\"Simeon shrugged. \"My grandfather didn't say anything about that.\"By half-closing his eyes, Niall was able to study the map he had memorized inthe white tower. It amazed him that, with the aid of the thought mirror, hismind could re-create every detail with the precision and clarity of aphotograph; it was an awesome glimpse into the unknown powers of memory. The mapindicated that the industrial estate was roughly circular, and more than twomiles in diameter. There was a large lake, still attractive although nowovergrown with reeds and algae, an industrial museum, and an administrationblock that resembled the pipes of some vast organ. Yet it was obvious to Niallthat none of these buildings bore the slightest resemblance to the square graystructure they were seeking. A gray building would have been out of place inthis explosion of color. But after passing the administration block, which stoodin the center of the complex, the nature of the buildings began to change.Presumably the lessees were unable to afford the more elaborate premises, or thedesigners of the estate had run out of money; at all events, the buildingsbecame increasingly functional, and many were built of plain red brick. Then,toward the eastern edge of the estate, Niall saw something that made his heartcontract: the top part of a gray building that rose behind the trees. Hepointed. \"That looks like it.\"Simeon surveyed it dubiously. \"It looks like an electricity generating station.There's one exactly like it on the other side of the city.\"In fact, as they changed their angle of approach, they could see that the graybuilding stood beside a water tower. For a moment Niall was convinced that hehad made a mistake. Then, as they emerged from a side path, he was able to seethe lower half of the building, and the banks of rich vegetation that surroundedit, with their red and yellow flowers. At that moment, he knew with intuitivecertainty that they had discovered Skorbo's secret larder. A curious wave ofcold energy, like a shiver, emanating from Dravig, told him that the spider wasalso aware of it.They were approaching the building from the rear, and they found themselvesfacing a blank wall, with no sign of doors or windows. It would clearly benecessary to find their way around to the front. This proved to be less simplethan it looked; a prickly hedge, which seemed to form the eastern boundary ofthe estate, blended into the mass of bushes and small trees that surrounded thebuilding. On closer inspection, this hedge proved to be a tangle of needlelikespikes, and it stretched up more than four feet above their heads -- too talleven for Dravig to step over. It was Sidonia who solved the problem by drawingher shortsword and stepping boldly into the bushes; with each heavy blow,severed branches and creepers fell at her feet. Within a few minutes she hadhacked her way through to the wall and exposed an overgrown concrete path aboutfour feet wide; this had prevented the vegetation from approaching too close tothe wall, and they were able to force their way around to the front of thebuilding.What faced them was a gray façade with half a dozen broken windows and a massivesteel door whose blue-tinged metal was still unrusted; a handle at one endindicated that this was of the type that slid open on rollers. Niall bracedhimself and heaved; the door slid open about four feet, then jammed. Sidonia,still holding her sword, took a cautious step inside. As she did so, Simeonshouted a warning, and something hurled itself out of the darkness. Sidonia wasthrown violently onto her back, her head striking the concrete floor. The forceof the blow probably saved her life; the spider that stood over her was poisedto strike at her throat, and would undoubtedly have done so if she had moved.Because she lay still, the fangs remained poised for long enough for Dravig --who had just squeezed his way around the corner of the building -- to transmit amental command. The spider froze in astonishment. But when Dravig ordered it tomove back, it ignored the command and remained in a threatening posture. Niallwas incredulous. It was the first time he had ever seen a spider defy the orderof a superior.Now he looked more closely, he was not even certain that the creature was aspider. The legs seemed to be encased in a kind of shell, like those of ascorpion. The huge black body, which was also encased in a jointed shell, like awood louse, was circular, completely lacking the waistline that separates thecephalothorax from the abdomen in most spiders. It was also lacking anythingresembling a head; the eyes and the fangs seemed to be set in the body. The bigbody and powerful legs gave an impression of immense physical strength; it wasobvious that the mandibles could sever the girl's head with a single pincermovement.Dravig was also astonished; as the special adviser of the Spider Lord, he hadbecome accustomed to instant obedience. Now it seemed unbelievable that thisuncouth monster, who looked more like a black beetle than a spider, should beignoring him. Perhaps the creature was mentally subnormal, or had simply failedto recognize him? Once again he snapped a mental command. Still the strangercontinued to stare back, its feelers trembling slightly, as if from tension, itseyes glinting red as they caught the light. Dravig's impatience turned to anger,and exploded in a burst of will-force that made Niall wince; the spider cringedand retreated a step backwards. Like Dravig, Niall expected it now to give wayand submit to Dravig's superior dominance. Instead, its sullen defiance turnedto anger, and it lashed out with a burst of will-force that was like a heavyblow. Dravig, who was unprepared, reacted exactly as if he had been struck by aphysical force; his two back legs started to buckle, and the gray hairs on hisbody quivered as if a wind had blown over them. Dravig responded with outrage,drawing himself up like a patrician who has been insulted by a commoner. But theother spider was unimpressed; it was obviously a stranger to this city. It tooka step forward and braced itself over Sidonia's body, its tarsal claws raised tothe fighting position. Niall observed nervously that Sidonia was beginning tostir; then she opened her eyes and stared up at the hairy belly poised aboveher. Fortunately, the challenger was paying too much attention to Dravig tonotice her.Then the two spiders were locked in a combat of wills. This was no longer aquestion of blows, but of strength pitted against strength. It was the firsttime Niall had witnessed such a combat, and he was fascinated to observe whathappened. It was as if each spider was surrounded by an energy field, like thelines of force surrounding a magnet. These two energy fields met head on,producing exactly the same effect as the like-poles of two magnets approachingone another and creating repulsion. Where they met, it was as if the lines offorce darkened in color, so they became visible. In fact, these force fieldswere invisible to Simeon, who could only see two spiders facing one another at adistance of about twelve feet, each one braced as if walking into a powerfulgale, or as if pushing at one another like two wrestlers. Niall could see theforce between them because he was on the same telepathic wavelength as Dravig.He could also see that Dravig was out of condition for this kind of combat. Hewas older, and it had been many years since he had been called upon to asserthis authority through force. And although his will power had the controlledthrust of a rapier, he lacked the sheer brute force of his adversary, whoseaggressive energies had the same strength as his squat body. Moreover, Dravig'sconviction was undermined by a feeling that this combat was an undignifiedabsurdity. And although it seemed that the two were locked in equal combat,neither giving nor losing the slightest advantage, Niall was aware that Dravigwas losing strength sooner than his opponent. What would happen if Dravig wasfinally forced to give way? Niall could almost see it as if it were happening atthe moment. The only way in which Dravig could save his own life would be tomake a ritual gesture of surrender, the equivalent of an animal turning tail.And this was inconceivable. Even now, as his energies remained locked in precisecounterpoise, Dravig's stance expressed a furious loathing of his opponent, adesire to see him punished and utterly abased. This meant that, when Dravig wasfinally forced to give way, he would inevitably be killed. And to a spider,death would have been a matter of indifference after surrendering to one heregarded as an inferior.Suddenly it struck Niall as absurd to be standing there while Dravig was engagedin a life-and-death struggle; it was an affront to his own courage. His state ofinner tension -- and his desire to see the stranger defeated -- was such that hecould also have faced death with indifference. Then his tension made him awareof the thought mirror against his chest; it produced a burning sensation,exactly as if it had been a flame. At the moment, its concave side was turnedinward, reflecting his thought-energies back inside himself and intensifying hispowers of concentration. Now he reached inside his shirt, turning it the otherway, and directing the force of his concentration at Dravig's adversary.The spider was startled by this additional attack, and immediately gave ground.A moment later, it registered with amazement that its adversary was a humanbeing. With a strength that Niall found incredible, and without losing an inchof ground, it braced itself to meet this new challenge, and began to fight backon two fronts. Niall immediately felt as if some invisible force was pushing himbackwards, and for a moment he felt absurdly lightweight and inadequate. Then heagain concentrated his will, and used all the force of the mirror to press homehis attack. The mirror became so hot that it burned his flesh, and he foundhimself wishing that he had taken the precaution of suspending it outside histunic. He ignored the pain, and summoned all his force to resist the power thatwas trying to force him backwards and then crush him to the ground.Several minutes passed. They were deadlocked. Niall's intervention had made itimpossible for the stranger to win; with all its brute strength, the spider wasnot sufficiently strong to press home the attack on two fronts. Yet it seemedcapable of holding its opponents at bay indefinitely, and Niall found himselfwondering how long he could maintain this intensity of concentration. His senseof urgency had steeled him to a level of effort that he would normally havefound impossible to maintain for more than a few minutes. But attempting tobatter down the will of this squat, powerful stranger was like trying to pushdown a brick wall by sheer physical force. He was aware that his own strengthwas beginning to flag.Then, with startling suddenness, all resistance vanished. As Niall stumbled andfell to his knees, he experienced an agonizing shock that seemed to tear hisintestines like a white hot flame. He looked down, expecting to see bloodgushing through his tunic, and was relieved to see that everything lookednormal. The stranger was staggering backwards, as if struck by a powerful blow.It took Niall a moment to realize what had happened: that Sidonia had driven hersword into its belly and ripped it sideways. Now he saw her withdraw it, andthen roll aside like an acrobat as the pincers tried to decapitate her. The painin his stomach had been the result of telepathic contact.Unlike Niall, Dravig had continued to exert his will-force; it was this that hadcaused the spider to stagger backwards, and which now smashed it to the groundlike some immense club. As it lay there, dazed and defeated, blood gushed fromits stomach over the concrete floor. Dravig contemplated it with cold hostilityfor a moment; then, holding it paralyzed with his will, he stepped forward anddrove his poison fangs into its head. He remained in that position for severalseconds, his legs braced, as the poison was injected. Niall was startled andshocked by the ferocity of the attack; he had somehow expected Dravig to showmercy. Then, as Dravig withdrew his fangs and stood back, Niall caught a glimpseinto his mind, and realized that he felt no fellow feeling toward the creaturehe had just killed. It was simply a dangerous wild animal that had justthreatened his life; now he had destroyed it with the same lack of compunctionthat it would have shown toward him.The poison must have been powerful; the spider gave a convulsive jerk thatturned it over on to its back, then became perfectly still, its legs bunchedcrookedly underneath it. Simeon went over and examined it with interest; Sidoniawrinkled her nose with haughty distaste. But when Dravig said \"Thank you\" -- itwas addressed to both of them -- she blushed like a schoolgirl. And Niallrealized with astonishment that she would have sacrificed her life for Dravigwithout a second thought. To save her the embarrassment of thinking he hadnoticed her blush, Niall turned to Simeon.\"Is it a spider?\"\"Not strictly speaking. It's called a bull spider -- my father used to call themdruggets. I think it's a member of the bug family.\"\"Have you ever seen one before?\"\"Oh yes. The beetles kept two of them as work animals. They're incredibly stupidbut immensely strong. Also incredibly loyal. Skorbo had probably ordered him tolet no one in. And he'd be prepared to attack the Spider Lord himself ratherthan disobey.\"Sidonia said: \"There's a colony of them in the old mine over there.\" Shegestured vaguely toward the east.Since the dead bull spider was occupying most of the doorway, Niall and Simeonhad to drag it aside -- like all spiders, it was surprisingly light for its size-- before they could enter. Then they pushed back the steel door to its limit --the groove in which the castors moved was filled with compacted rust and grit.The first thing they saw was a mutilated corpse lying in a pool of blood. It wasa woman, and her head and left arm had been eaten away. Her clothing, stillcovered in spider web, lay nearby; it had been neatly sliced off by thebull-spider's mandibles. They had evidently interrupted it in the course ofeating its dinner.Niall looked up. In the dim light that pierced the dusty windows he could see adozen or so human-shaped cocoons suspended from the beams that supported theceiling. They swayed gently in the breeze, exactly as he had seen them in hisglimpse into the captain's mind. In fact, he was startled to realize how closelythis shed corresponded to that momentary glimpse, as if all its essentialfeatures had been conveyed instantaneously. There was only one slightdifference. The slaughterhouse of his vision had stunk of blood; this place onlyhad a damp and musty odor. And this, he realized, was due to the differencebetween the senses of a man and the far keener senses of a spider.Niall asked Simeon: \"Do you think any of them are alive?\"\"She was alive.\" Simeon indicated the woman's corpse. \"Otherwise her bloodwouldn't have flowed like that.\"Niall turned to Dravig. \"Do you think any of them could be saved?\" Dravig'smental gesture was the equivalent of a shrug. The warehouse was virtually a bareconcrete shed, empty except for a number of packing cases stored in its farthestcorner. The suspended bodies hung six feet or so above their heads. Each wascovered with a semitransparent gauzy mesh of surprising delicacy, far thinnerthan normal strands of spider web. As Niall's eyes became accustomed to the poorlight, he was able to distinguish the features underneath the gauze that coveredthe faces -- in one case, even to observing that the eyes were open.Simeon pointed. \"That looks like a child.\"The body hanging closest to the far wall was only about three feet tall; throughthe thin web that covered his face like a hood, Niall could see dark curly hair.Simeon voiced the thought that was in Niall's mind.\"Could that be the brother of your kitchen maid, what's her name?\"\"Nyra. It could be.\" He asked Dravig: \"Is it possible to cut him down?\"The spider braced himself against the wall and reached up with the legscontaining the tarsal claws, steadying the body with one of them while the othersnipped the thread that held it suspended. He caught it neatly with hispedipalps as it fell.As Niall took the body from him, the sticky web clung to his fingers and histunic. He carried the child into the sunlight and lowered him carefully to thefloor. The gauze covering the face was like a film of sticky rubber, andresisted all attempts to tear it. Niall borrowed Sidonia's shortsword, which hadan edge like a razor and, pulling up the mesh so it was clear of the face,carefully sliced his way through the clinging threads. The face that was exposedwas that of a boy of about seven. The face was deathly pale, and there was nosign of breathing. But as Simeon was cutting away the mesh that covered the arm,Dravig extended his pedipalps above the chest and said: \"He is alive.\" A momentlater, Simeon placed his thumb on the child's wrist and pronounced that he couldfeel a faint pulse.Niall placed his hand on the cold forehead. \"Is there any way of reviving him?\"Simeon shook his head. \"I don't know. If it's a poison that paralyzes thecentral nervous system, the damage may be irreversible. That one's probably deadalready.\" He pointed to a face that was as emaciated as a skull.Niall asked Dravig: \"Is he dead?\"Dravig stretched upwards, raising his pedipalps toward the swaying body.\"No. He is alive. They are all alive, although the woman at the far end is closeto death.\"Sidonia startled them with a cry. \"That one moved his eyes!\"She was standing underneath a body that hung from the center of the beam, wherethe light from the doorway was strong. The body was small -- it might have beenthat of an overgrown child or teenager. Behind the gauze that covered the face,the eyes were closed. Niall stared intently, but could detect no sign ofbreathing.\"Are you sure?\"\"Quite sure. His eyelids moved.\"Niall addressed the face that swayed above his head. \"If you can hear me, try toopen your eyelids.\"Nothing happened. He repeated it, slower and louder. This time, after a longdelay, there was a faint but unmistakable movement of the eyelids. Sidonia said:\"You see. He is alive.\"Dravig said: \"It is not a he. It is a woman.\"From the other side of the shed, Simeon gave an exclamation of excitement. Hewas looking at the packing cases that stood in the far corner.\"What is it?\"\"This stuff is labeled hospital equipment. Lend me that sword, would you? I wantto try and get the lid off.\"As Niall looked down at the child who lay on the concrete, a flash of pain inthe back of his skull warned him that he had been wearing the thought mirror fortoo long; he removed it and dropped it into his pocket. The relief was sointense that he felt dizzy; he had forgotten that the thought mirror consumed somuch energy. Momentary darkness clouded his vision, filling his head with abuzzing noise, and he felt himself swaying. To avoid falling, he crouched downon his heels, balancing himself with both hands on the floor.A few moments later the blackness began to pass away, and the child's facebecame visible. And then, quite suddenly, he was overwhelmed by a feeling ofintense cold. It felt exactly as if he had been plunged into the depths of someicy lake, where the light found it impossible to penetrate. At the same time, heexperienced a return of the nausea of the previous day, the peculiar exhaustionthat had succeeded the attack by Skorbo's assassin. There was an odd sensationthat something unpleasant had happened. Niall started around in bewilderment,and was relieved to see that everything looked so normal. Simeon and Sidoniawere trying to open one of the packing cases, with Dravig looking on; it wasobvious that they had noticed nothing. Through the open door, the bushes wereglowing in the late afternoon sunlight -- oddly enough, they seemed to bewavering, as if seen through a heat-haze. Yet he was gripped by an icy cold sointense that he had to clench his teeth to prevent them from chattering. He wasalso aware of a sense of vulnerability, as if a layer of skin had been strippedaway, leaving all nerve-ends exposed.The sunlight outside looked infinitely alluring, yet his weariness was so deepthat he found it impossible to drag himself to his feet. It was a temptation tolie down on the floor and close his eyes. Yet he felt that if he gave way to thetemptation, he would freeze to death. It cost him a convulsive effort of will toallow himself to sink into a sitting position, then to turn over on to his handsand knees and force himself to stand up. As he did so, he again felt his sensesleaving him; but he mastered the nausea, and forced himself to take the halfdozen steps that carried him out into the sunlight.It was like plunging into a warm bath. The warmth seemed as startling andinexplicable as the cold of a few moments before. He breathed a deep sigh ofrelief, at the same time placing both hands on the nearest bush to preventhimself from swaying. As the warmth soaked into his body, he tried to understandwhat was happening. This glowing sensation was not simply the heat of the sun;it was a vital energy that made his heart beat faster and filled his blood witha pleasurable excitement. And the cold inside the building was not physicalcold; it had the effect of draining his vitality; it was a sensation like badnews.As the freezing sensation gradually melted away, his senses readjusted to thesoothing warmth. The shimmering energy that surrounded him felt exactly asthough warm air was rising through vents in the ground. It was associated with apleasant tingling in the nerves, as if tiny bubbles were bursting all over hisskin. With his eyes closed, he could sense that some form of energy was risingfrom the ground, and was somehow being converted into a spray by the plants andbushes. This is why he felt as if he was standing in a shower of spray from afountain.Yet why was the polarity reversed inside the building, so that it drained hisvitality instead of increasing it? Now that his energies felt recharged, thisquestion filled him with curiosity. Deliberately bracing himself, he steppedforward across the threshold of the warehouse. It was, as he expected, likeplunging into icy water. Yet there was an important difference. Cold water wouldhave produced a freezing sensation in his feet and legs. This cold seemed toattack his face and shoulders, like an icy wind blowing down from above. As hetook another slow step forward, it struck the crown of his head, causing theskin to contract so his hair felt as if it was standing on end. Then, as heforced himself to take another step, it was concentrated on his scalp and theskin of his neck and shoulders. And since he was now standing directly under thecentral beam, with its suspended bodies, it seemed reasonable to assume that thecold was associated with the bodies. This was confirmed when he took anotherstep, and the freezing sensation moved to the back of his head and the upperpart of his spine. It cost an effort of self-discipline to turn and walk backunder the bodies; it felt as if he was naked and standing in a shower of icyrain.Yet why should unconscious bodies produce this sensation? The question sointrigued him that he mastered the desire to go out into the sunlight, andforced himself to stand there, trying to understand what was happening. Was itpossible that these devitalized bodies were somehow stealing his own vitalenergies? But if that was the explanation, why had the others not noticed it?For a moment he considered hanging the thought mirror round his neck, but wasdeterred by the thought of the agony it would produce in his present state offatigue. Instead, he closed his eyes and twisted his face into a grimace ofintense concentration. The relief was immediate; it was as if he had interposeda barrier between himself and the suspended bodies. Even so, the cold wasbeginning to make his shoulder muscles ache.It was at this point that he realized that his efforts had attracted Dravig'sattention. The spider was staring at him so intently that it produced aprickling sensation in the roots of his hair. He had time to register this asunusual -- Dravig would normally have regarded it as a form of rudeness -- whenthere was an explosion of light inside his skull, and a sensation as if thebreath had been snatched from his lungs. For a moment he felt as though he wasdrowning and was overwhelmed with panic. Then the breathlessness passed, and ashis senses cleared, he realized he was being held up by Sidonia and Simeon. Hestraightened his legs and forced himself into an upright position, realizingthat his legs had buckled underneath him. At the same time he noticed that thecold had vanished, and that the air in the building felt pleasantly warm. Hisvoice sounded thick as he asked: \"What happened?\"Dravig said: \"Did you not realize that you were being attacked?\"Niall shook his head. \"No. I just felt cold.\" He still felt as if he had justclimbed out of an icy river.\"You were cold because you were being attacked. Your energies were beingdrained.\" Responding to the question in Niall's mind, Dravig indicated the bodythat swayed above Niall's head. It was the girl whose eyelids had moved. Niallstared up at her, trying to distinguish the features beneath the gauze thatcovered them. \"But she is unconscious.\"\"Yes. She is unconscious. You were being attacked through her. You have adangerous enemy.\"As he spoke, Niall was overwhelmed with a sense of his own stupidity. Suddenly,everything was obvious, and he found it difficult to understand how he couldhave failed to see it. Because he had assumed that the unconscious bodies weredraining his energy, he had looked no further for an explanation.He asked: \"What did you do?\"\"I tried to attack your enemy through your mind. But it was too late. He hadalready withdrawn.\"Simeon said: \"Come on. Let's get you into the sunlight!\" Niall needed nopersuading; he still felt frozen to the bone. As he walked outside, withSimeon's hand on his elbow, his legs felt numb and stiff. The feeling of thesunlight on his face brought a sense of relief; yet he was aware that somethinghad changed. The air was no longer full of shimmering heat-waves; this wasmerely the normal sunlight of a winter afternoon. The bushes still glowed withthe same magical brightness; but when he reached out and touched them, there wasno longer a sensation like standing in a shower of fine spray.He asked Dravig: \"Is it possible to reach this girl and cut her down?\"\"Of course.\" He returned into the building, and a few moments later, emergedwith the web-encased body gripped in his pedipalps and front legs. He laid heron the ground at Niall's feet.\"Your sword please.\" Sidonia handed it to him. Niall pulled the web clear of theface, and carefully cut it open; as it parted, it made a faint tearing soundlike rubber. Niall sliced down as far as the waist. As he had expected, she waswearing a slave's tunic. Simeon watched with curiosity as he reached down insidethe neckline. Niall found what he was looking for between the small flatbreasts; the tightness of the web had prevented it from falling out. Niallsnapped the chain, and held out the pendant on the palm of his hand.Simeon shook his head incredulously. \"Another one of those.\" He took the girl'schin in his hand and turned her face toward him. \"She doesn't look like theothers.\"It was true. Her hair was short, like that of a boy, but the features had thedelicacy of a girl, with a finely shaped nose. The face might have been made ofwax, and the lips were so bloodless that they looked white.Simeon tore aside the gauze of web, freeing her arm, and placed his thumb on herwrist.\"There's a pulse all right.\" He stared with curiosity at the pale face. \"But I'dlike to know how she got here.\"\"Like the others. Walking around at night. She's lucky she wasn't eaten.\"Simeon said: \"I wonder if she's the reason they killed Skorbo.\"The same idea had occurred to Niall. \"It's possible.\"\"In that case, she's dangerous.\"\"Dangerous?\" For a moment he was puzzled; the unconscious girl looked anythingbut dangerous.\"He may be willing to kill to get her back.\"Niall shrugged. \"That's a risk we'll have to take.\" But he was aware that hesounded more confident than he felt. He turned to Sidonia. \"Would you mindstaying here to guard her until we return?\"\"Of course not, lord. But would it not be simpler for me to carry her?\"\"Carry her?\" The idea had not even occurred to him.\"She looks as light as a child.\"Her words reminded him of the child who was still lying on the concrete floor.Now that the sun was sinking below the treetops, the air was becoming chilly.\"No, Dravig can carry her. But do you think you could carry him?\"\"Of course.\" She picked up the child as easily as if he had been a doll,cradling his head on her shoulder.As they walked back toward the setting sun, Niall's body ached with weariness. Achill wind sprang up from the north, and he pulled up the hood of his cloak anddrew its folds more closely around him. The events of the day had left himprofoundly tired, and fatigue had numbed his senses, so he walked mechanically,oblivious of his surroundings. Yet underneath the exhaustion there was a senseof deep satisfaction, which revived every time he looked at the child inSidonia's arms, or at the girl who was now being carried by Dravig. And now, inretrospect, he could begin to understand what had happened in Skorbo's larder.As he had removed the thought mirror from his neck, he had experienced momentaryloss of consciousness. His enemy had seized the opportunity to insinuate himselfinto his mind like an invisible leech. Yet this had proved to be a seriousmiscalculation, since he had alerted them to his presence. The result was thatthis girl -- whose identity would otherwise have gone unsuspected -- was nowtheir hostage. The enemy might be unpredictable and dangerous, but he wasobviously not infallible. . .Niall had become so absorbed in his thoughts that it came as a surprise torealize that they were already entering the main square. The sun was sinkingbelow the western rooftops; only the top half of the white tower reflected itsgolden light. Most of the snow had vanished from the square; it remained only onthe grass that surrounded the white tower.As they halted at the bottom of the steps, he saw the two wolf spiders who keptguard on either side of the door. \"What are they doing here?\"Dravig said: \"The Death Lord ordered them to keep guard. He was afraid that someof Skorbo's friends might bear you malice.\"\"Please thank him for his consideration.\" A few hours earlier, the thought ofguards outside the palace would have struck him as ridiculous; now they broughta sense of security.As he entered the main hallway, Nephtys was descending the stair; her smile ofwelcome turned to astonishment as Dravig entered, with the girl resting in hispedipalps. Sidonia followed, with the child in her arms.He asked her: \"Is the kitchen maid Nyra still here?\"\"Yes, my lord.\"\"Ask her to come here.\"Dravig laid the girl on the matting in front of the fire; Sidonia set down thechild beside her. A moment later, Nyra came in, looking apprehensive. Niallpointed to the child. \"Is this your brother?\"As she looked at the still form her face became deathly pale; for a moment Niallthought she was going to faint. He said quickly: \"He is alive.\"She gave a cry and dropped on her knees beside the child. When she saw that hewas breathing, she seized him and covered his face in kisses. Then, to Niall'sembarrassment, she rushed over to him, seized both his hands, and pressed themto her lips. He freed one of them and placed it gently on her hair.\"There. The next task is to revive him.\" He turned to Simeon. \"What do youadvise?\"\"Give him a warm bath, and massage his arms and legs.\" Niall could sense that hewas less than optimistic; but Nyra was too excited to notice.Nephtys was looking down with curiosity at the girl, whose breast was alsorising and falling gently.Niall said: \"She was also destined for Skorbo's dinner.\" His words made hershrink, but he was too tired to care. \"I want you to prepare the room next tomine, and place her in a warm bed. The door is to remain locked and bolted allthe time.\" The sight of her pale face reminded him of the pendant. He excusedhimself and went down into the basement; it was in darkness, but the lightthrough the open door enabled him to grope his way to the urn in the corner. Ashe removed the pendant from his pocket, his fingertips told him that it hadceased to be inert; it seemed to squirm like a living beetle. He removed theheavy lid with both hands and dropped the pendant into its depths. As hereplaced the lid he experienced a curious sense of lightness.An hour later, he was stretched out on the cushions in his chamber, eating adish of river prawns that had just been cooked by Jarita. Simeon was helpingNyra to bathe the child. The sound of excited voices told him that Nyra'sparents had arrived; they had been summoned to the palace. He tried to generatethe energy to go and see what was happening, then decided to drink a glass ofmead instead. Ten minutes later, as Jarita was laying the table for supper,Nephtys came into the room, smiling with pleasure. \"He's just opened his eyes. ..\" She became silent as Jarita shook her head and pointed. Niall was lying onhis back, sleeping deeply. Part TwoThe Living Dead That night was made memorable by another curious experience. Niall woke up in adarkness that was as warm and suffocating as a blanket. For a moment he imaginedhe was back in the burrow; then the collapse of the ashes in the stove made himaware that he was in his own room. He lay there with all his senses alert,wondering if he had been awakened by some noise. When his sixth sense assuredhim that he was alone, he threw back the blankets and turned on his back in thevelvet darkness, wondering why he found it so difficult to breathe. His heartwas pounding and his body was covered in perspiration.Inevitably, his mind returned to the warehouse with its hanging bodies, and hevisualized them so clearly that he even seemed to be able to see them suspendedabove him in the dark. Even by daylight the scene had been unpleasant enough;now, in the middle of the night, he found himself imagining how the victim feltas a spider landed on him, immobilizing him with its will power, then sinkingits fangs into the flesh and injecting the venom that would bring totalparalysis. He could envisage how the victims felt as they were carried, fullyconscious, to the warehouse, wrapped in a cocoon of sticky spider silk, thensuspended upside down, in the full knowledge that they were to be eaten alive.The thought was so horrifying that he writhed as if in pain.In fact, he knew that it was stupid to be tormented by these imaginings, andthat in the daylight they would vanish like a nightmare. Yet even this thoughtbecame a kind of torment, for he was aware that the horror was real. Eventually,by using his will power to relax his muscles and slow down his heartbeat, hesucceeded in restoring a sense of peace and equilibrium. As the gray light ofdawn began to seep into the room, he felt himself drifting back into sleep.The dream that followed had a curious air of reality. He was standing outsidethe palace, and the air was full of falling snow; flakes of snow were melting onhis cheeks. He was trying to push open the door, but it seemed to be locked.Then he heard footsteps from inside, and someone drew back the bolt. The dooropened and his father was standing there. His mother, who was leaning over thebalustrade at the top of the stairs, called: \"Who is it?\" and his fatheranswered: \"It's only Niall. He's been looking for the magician.\" For somereason, this answer struck Niall as incongruous. How could his father know aboutthe magician, since he had died before Niall came to the spider city? Therealization that his father was dead made Niall suddenly aware that he must bedreaming. He looked carefully at his father to see if there was any obviousindication of his unreality; in fact, he looked as real and solid as usual. Thebeard and mustache were streaked with the gray hairs that had developed in thefinal year of his life, and he was wearing the shabby garment of the caterpillarskin that he had worn on the journey to Dira. The hall in which they werestanding also looked completely normal, and when Niall put out a finger to touchthe flecked green marble of the wall, it felt cool and solid, exactly as he hadexpected it to feel. Then he looked down at the floor, which should have beenmade of the same substance, and experienced a sense of triumph when he saw thatit was made of triangular slabs of a stone that looked like granite. This wasundeniable proof that he was dreaming. But in that case, where was he? Theobvious answer was: lying asleep in bed. Yet when he moved his shoulders to seeif he could feel the bed, it seemed obvious that he was standing in the hall. Itthen struck him that if his body was lying asleep upstairs, the simplest way tofind out would be to go and look.He took a step toward the stairs, then decided that, since he was dreaming, hemight as well fly. He raised his arms in the air and rose gently from the groundand up over the balustrade where his mother was standing. Floating on up thesecond flight of stairs, he alighted on the floor outside his chamber. Inside,he found Jarita laying the table for breakfast; she was so preoccupied that shedid not even notice him. He opened his bedroom door and went inside; just as heexpected, he was lying in bed, fast asleep, with his left arm lying on thecoverlet and his right hand under the pillow. He went and stood by the bed,looking down on his body with a kind of pleased astonishment, wondering whatwould happen if he leaned over and shook himself by the shoulder: would hisother self wake up and speak to him? Then suddenly he knew what would happen: hewould wake up and find himself in bed. But he had no desire to wake up yet; thesituation was far too interesting. Therefore he stepped back quietly and tiptoedout of the room. Jarita was still so absorbed that she failed to notice him, andhe was tempted to give her a pinch; he decided against it in case she screamedand woke him up. He tiptoed out into the corridor.Now he recollected that he had ordered the unconscious girl to be placed in thenext room. He pushed open the door and entered. Simeon was in the room, standingby the bed, which was underneath the window, and cutting the spider silk fromthe girl's body with a huge pair of scissors whose blades must have been over afoot long. As the snapping steel reached her feet, Simeon pulled open the silkwith a jerk. The girl was not wearing shoes, and Niall observed that there weremarks around her ankles, as if they had been tied. He asked Simeon: \"What arethose?\" and Simeon shook his head and said: \"Damned if I know.\" The phrase wasquite uncharacteristic of Simeon, reminding Niall that this was a dream.And now, to Niall's surprise, Simeon began cutting off the slave uniform,starting at the top near the neck. The big shears sliced through the coarse graycloth until they reached the bottom of the garment, which fell apart, revealingthat she was naked underneath. The first thing that struck Niall was that herbody was unusually pale, and that faint blue veins showed in the skin of herthighs, which were delicately curved. But he was puzzled by fragments of somebrown substance that was sticking to the small, flat breasts; there were alsotraces of it on her belly and thighs. Niall reached out and peeled off one ofthe larger pieces; it was dry, like a fragment of leaf mold.He looked down at the sleeping face. \"I wonder what she's called?\"\"Charis.\"\"How do you know?\"Simeon made the curious reply: \"It's written on her heart.\"A sound from the street drew Niall's attention, and he looked out the window. Inthe square below, a gang of workmen led by the overseer Dion were pulling alarge cart on which there was a wooden packing case; he recognized it as beingone of those from the corner of the warehouse. He turned to Simeon. \"One of yourcases has arrived.\" Simeon looked out the window and said with enthusiasm:\"Good! Let's go and unpack it.\" Niall asked: \"What are you expecting to find?\"\"What does it matter? It's sure to be interesting.\" He pulled the bedclothes upover the naked girl, and hurried to the door. As they stepped into the corridor,Niall turned the key in the door and dropped it into his pocket. Simeon lookedsurprised. \"Why lock the door? She won't escape.\" Niall lowered his voice. \"Idon't trust Jarita any more than I trust Skorbo.\" At that moment he glancedtoward his own chamber and saw that Jarita was, in fact, looking through thepartly open door. His certainty that she must have overheard made him feelguilty and apologetic. Then, to his surprise, she wrinkled her nose at him andstuck out her tongue. He was so startled that he woke up.The sun was shining through the half-closed curtains; from its position on thewall he guessed that it was about seven o'clock. From outside he could hear thesound of birds. It was then that he realized that he was lying with his left armon the coverlet of the bed, and his right hand under the pillow, just as he hadseen himself in his dream. The realization startled him; he usually slept on hisleft side or his right. Was it possible that the strange dream contained someelement of reality?He yawned and stretched, then climbed out of bed. He winced when he accidentallytouched the red spot in the middle of his chest -- the bruise caused by thethought mirror during his encounter with the bull spider; the skin was peelingfrom it, as if it had been subjected to intense sunburn. It made him aware thata certain feeling of weariness still lingered in his muscles. He slipped intothe sheepskin mantle that he used as a dressing gown and went out into thecorridor, closing the door quietly behind him in case he woke Jarita, who sleptin the next room. On the other side of his chamber was the room to which thegirl had been taken. As he reached out to the handle, he noticed that the brasskey in the keyhole was the same key he had seen in his dream.But the room itself was different. It contained more furniture, and the bed wasagainst the right-hand wall, not under the window. He half-expected to findSimeon there, and felt oddly relieved to find it empty. Even now, his tirednesscreated a faintly dreamlike sensation, so that for an absurd moment he foundhimself wondering if he was still asleep.The girl was lying on the bed; she had been covered with a blanket that leftonly her face visible. When Niall pulled this back, he saw that she was stillencased in a cocoon of spider silk. Her breathing was scarcely visible, and whenhe touched her forehead the flesh felt cold. As he looked down at her, heexperienced again the sensation of his dream -- a feeling of being on the vergeof some interesting discovery. Like an empty house, her sleeping mind seemed toinvite him to investigate its secrets. Yet even as he placed his hand on hercold forehead, he experienced an oddly uncomfortable sensation as if he wasbeing observed.He crossed to the window, which was closed -- in the dream, it had been open. Itcost some effort to open it -- the brass screw that controlled the slidingopener was thick with dust and the hinges were rusty. But even before he forcedit open, he was aware that the dream had been incorrect in another particular:the view from this window was not of the square, but of an empty building nextdoor.When he pushed open the casement to its limit, a small portion of the square infront of the palace became visible. He breathed deeply, enjoying a fresh breeze.As he did so, he heard voices in the square and the sound of laughter. Suddenly,he knew with absolute certainly what he was going to see next. A moment later,four men came into view, dragging a baggage cart by the shafts. Then, as thecart itself became visible, he saw that it contained one of the large packingcases from the warehouse. Another four men were pushing from behind, and theoverseer Dion was walking beside it. For a moment, the dreamlike sensationintensified, and he shook his head to get rid of it, pulling the sheepskincloser round his throat.The door behind him opened; Jarita stood there in her night clothes -- aknee-length tunic of thin cotton-like material. She looked embarrassed to findhim there.\"Is my lord ready for his bath?\" She spoke with eyes on the ground, but Niallobserved that she had stolen a glance toward the bed. He was glad that the girlwas covered with the blanket.\"Yes, in a moment.\" He spoke curtly, vaguely annoyed that she had interruptedhim. She withdrew in silence.The square was now empty; at this time of the morning, there were few peopleabout. Jarita's interruption had somehow destroyed the curious sense ofanticipation. After another glance at the unconscious girl, he realized that thedesire to probe her mind had evaporated. As he closed the door behind him, heturned the key in the lock and dropped it into his pocket.Niall's bathroom was less elaborate than the equivalent room in Kazak's palace,in which the circular bath was tiled with white porcelain, and was the size of asmall swimming pool. This bath was a square stone tub, about six feet wide, sunkinto the floor; a furnace underneath kept it perpetually warm. Neither was thewater in this tub scented; to the bafflement of his womenfolk, Niall preferredplain water.As he descended slowly into the water -- which was a little too hot for comfort-- Jarita came in with bath towels. She placed them on a wooden bench, thenstood waiting. He knew she was hoping to be asked to join him in the water, buthe wanted to be alone.\"Shall I bring the oil of roses, my lord?\"\"No, thank you.\"When the door had closed behind her, he sat down in the warm water -- it came upto his shoulders -- and leaned back against the wall of the tub. Then, in therelaxation that followed, he set out to recall his dream. Unlike most dreams,this one had not faded, and he was able to go over it step by step, from themoment he had found himself standing outside the palace in the falling snow. Thesensation of floating up the stairs had been quite clear; so had the curiousexperience of standing and looking down at his own body as it lay asleep. Thisstruck him as oddly significant, yet he was unable to understand why. He alsorecollected the size of the pair of scissors that Simeon had used to cut off thegirl's clothes; they were so large that they seemed almost comic. But when herecalled standing at the window, and watching the baggage cart go past, heremembered that there had been no snow on the ground. That seemed to prove thatit was nothing more than a dream. In which case, what was the significance ofits strange symbolism? What were the brown, leaflike fragments on the girl'sbody? Why had Simeon said that her name was written on her heart? (He tried hardto recollect her name, but was unable to do so.) And why had he told Simeon thathe would not trust Jarita any more than Skorbo? This seemed typical of thestupid, irrational statements made in dreams. Yet although the whole thing hadthe absurdity of a dream, he still felt that it concealed some deeper meaning.Niall stifled a yawn. This weariness troubled him; it seemed absurd to feel sosleepy when he had been awake for less than half an hour. In an attempt to shakeit off, he gripped his nostrils between thumb and forefinger, and plunged hishead below the surface of the water. There was a roaring sensation as the waterentered his ears. Yet this was accompanied by an instantaneous feeling ofrelief, as if something inside his brain was expanding. When he came up gaspingfor air, the sense of relief continued, although he noticed that the wearinessbegan to return as he leaned his head back against the wall of the tub andclosed his eyes. He gripped his nostrils again and plunged his head under water.Once again, he experienced the sensation of relief, as if a window had openedinside his head and a cool breeze was blowing in. He allowed his body to slipdown inside the bath until he was lying on the bottom; the depth of water abovehis head produced an oddly comforting sensation. This time he held his breathuntil his lungs were bursting.When his head broke the surface, he was startled to realize that someone wasstanding beside the bath; he had to rub the water out of his eyes before herecognized Jarita.\"I'm sorry, my lord. I knocked twice.\"\"What is it?\" He was beginning to feel resentful about these interruptions.\"The doctor is here. He wants to know if he can look at the ax.\"\"The ax? What does he want it for? Oh, never mind. Give it to him. And ask himto stay and have some breakfast.\"It was only after she had gone that Niall realized that the feeling of wearinesshad vanished completely.When he entered the room, five minutes later, Simeon was seated at the table,with the ax lying in front of him. Its head was resting on a white cloth, andSimeon was carefully scraping the edge of the blade with a knife. He was soabsorbed that he failed to hear Niall entering the room, and only glanced up atthe sound of the closing door.\"What are you doing?\"\"Taking scrapings from the blade.\" He indicated a few traces of a brownish-blacksubstance on the white cloth. \"I'm going to try to find out if it's beenpoisoned.\"\"Is my brother no better?\"\"Worse. He has a fever.\"Niall's heart contracted with anxiety. \"Is it serious?\"\"I don't think so. That's what puzzles me. If the ax had been poisoned, I'dexpect him to be dead by now.\"Jarita came in from the kitchen, carrying a plate containing a pile of pancakes.As they seated themselves at the table, Niall asked: \"How will you test it?\" Hewas aware that Simeon's laboratory in the hospital was primitive.\"To begin with, dissolve these scrapings in a salt solution, then examine themon a microscope slide.\"\"Microscope? You have a microscope?\"Simeon chuckled as he poured honey on a pancake. \"I've more than that. Thosepacking cases contained some marvelous stuff. Hypodermics, scalpels, even aspectroscopic analyzer. You ought to come and see.\"Niall said: \"The brown stain on the blade is Skorbo's blood. Could that explainVeig's fever?\"\"I doubt it. Why should it? Spider blood's not poisonous.\"\"What if there was spider venom on the ax blade?\"Simeon nodded. \"I thought of that too. A very small quantity of spider venommight explain the symptoms. If so, he'll be all right in a day or so, as hebuilds up resistance.\"They were interrupted by a timid knock on the door. Jarita opened it. Niallrecognized the slight, blonde girl who stood there as Crestia, Veig'smaidservant.\"My master is coming to see his brother.\"Simeon snorted. \"That's stupid. He's not well enough.\"The girl was obviously unhappy. \"That is what I told him. . .\"\"Well, go back at once and tell him I forbid it.\"\"Too late.\" Veig stood in the doorway. \"I thought I'd come and join you forbreakfast.\"If it had been later in the day, Niall would have assumed he was drunk. Veig wasswaying slightly, and he spoke slowly and hesitantly, choosing his words withcare. Niall signaled to Jarita.\"Set another place for my brother.\" He crossed the room and took Veig's arm.\"Come and sit down.\"\"Thank you.\" Veig disengaged his arm. \"There's nothing wrong with me -- just aslight fever.\" He sank down on the cushions and leaned his back against thewall. \"I won't have anything to eat. Just some fruit juice or milk.\"Niall could see why Simeon looked concerned. Veig's forehead was covered inperspiration, and his face was pale. There were dark rings under his eyes -- sodark that they looked like bruises -- and the bandage around his right hand wassoaked in blood.Jarita placed a large goblet of papaya juice on the table. Veig picked it up inboth hands, drank thirstily until he had almost drained it, then began to cough.Finally, he leaned his head back against the wall, his eyes closed; a drop ofjuice ran down into his beard. Niall watched him with concealed anxiety. WhenVeig's breathing became heavy and regular, Niall gently probed his mind --assuming, correctly, that in his present state of affliction, his brother wouldbe unaware of the intrusion. What he observed troubled him. Although he seemedto be awake, Veig was actually half-asleep; his consciousness was being invadedby confused images from the world of dreams. The worst of these was a black,shapeless being, more like an octopus than a man, that was trying to engulf him.Now Niall understood why Veig had come to join them; he was afraid to be alone.He also realized that the best way to allay his brother's fear was to behavenormally. He therefore called to Jarita, asking her to bring the herb tea andthe hard-boiled quails' eggs. Then he continued his conversation with Simeon.\"Do you know what happened to the little boy we brought back?\"\"He regained consciousness last night. But he is still too weak to move.\"\"How did they wake him?\"Jarita, who was bending over the table, said: \"They gave him a warm bath andmassaged his body with oil of roses.\"Niall asked Simeon: \"Do you think that might work for the others?\"\"It's possible. But I doubt it. Children are more resilient than adults.\"Veig opened his eyes. \"I hear you brought a girl back with you.\" His voice wasstill heavy and slurred, yet he seemed more alert.Niall nodded. \"She's in the next room.\"\"Who is she?\"Niall waited until he was sure Jarita was out of hearing before he replied. \"Wethink she is an accomplice of the men who killed Skorbo.\"Simeon said: \"Although I can't imagine why they wanted to bring a girl withthem.\"Veig said: \"Perhaps she was some kind of housekeeper. They must have had ahideout somewhere.\"Niall asked: \"Would you like to see her?\"Veig grinned. \"Is she pretty?\"Niall also grinned, glad to hear his brother sounding more like his normal self.\"Very.\"\"In that case, yes.\"Niall pushed his plate away. Veig said: \"Finish your breakfast -- there's nohurry.\"\"I'd finished anyway.\"Simeon asked Veig: \"Are you feeling better?\"\"I think so. This thing comes and goes.\" But as he rose, he swayed, and had toclutch at the wall for support.The maidservant Crestia was waiting outside the door. She looked anxiously atVeig but, to Niall's relief, made no move toward him. Niall knew his brotherwell enough to know that he would resent any attempt at help.He unlocked the door and let them in. As he stepped inside, Niall was againreminded of the dream. The memory was so clear that he hung back, waiting to seewhat Simeon would do next.In fact, Simeon pulled back the blanket and lifted the girl's wrist. \"Nothingwrong with her pulse.\" Simeon raised the girl's eyelids with his thumb, thenopened her mouth. \"My God!\"\"What is it?\" Niall looked into her mouth and saw what had startled Simeon. Thetip of the girl's tongue was split, so that it resembled the tongue of a snake.Simeon touched it gently with his fingertip. \"Poor girl. That looks to me as ifit's been deliberately cut.\"Niall could see why he thought so; a V-shaped segment of the tongue was missing.\"Why should anyone do that?\"Simeon said grimly: \"Perhaps she talked too much.\"\"Would that prevent her from talking?\"\"It would make it difficult. When you speak, notice how often you press yourtongue against your teeth.\" Simeon drew the blanket down to her feet, thentugged at the spider web that still encased the lower half of her body. \"Let'shave this off.\" He reached into the side pocket of his tunic and took out a pairof scissors.Niall was almost relieved to see that they were not the grotesquely large pairof his dream, but only slightly larger than normal; it seemed to confirm thatthe dream had been merely a freak of his sleeping consciousness. When Simeon hadsliced the web down to her feet, he pulled it free and threw it on the floor. Itwas so light that it scarcely made a sound. Niall was now able to observe thather feet were bare, and that around both ankles there were faint red marks.\"Now this, I think.\" Simeon began to cut the slave tunic, starting from theneck. The scissors were obviously very sharp and as the fabric parted, Niall wasable to see that, just as in the dream, the girl was naked underneath. A momentlater, his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his cheeks. On the whiteflesh of the belly and thighs, there were a number of brown fragments that mighthave been damp autumn leaves.He reached out and peeled one from her thigh.\"What do you think this is?\"Simeon took it from him and peered at it. \"I'd say it's a piece of seaweed.\"\"Seaweed? Why should she be wearing seaweed?\"Simeon shrugged. \"I'm damned if I know.\" As he spoke, Niall experienced acurious sensation of two overlapping realities.He pointed to the red marks around the ankles. \"What do you suppose they are?\"Simeon studied them carefully. \"Looks as though she's been tied up. But it musthave been for a long time, or the marks would have disappeared.\" He peered atthe space between her big toe and its neighbor; Niall could see they wereconnected by a thin web of flesh. \"And she hasn't had the operation to separatethe toes.\"Remembering the words spoken in the dream, Niall asked: \"I wonder what she'scalled?\"But Simeon merely shook his head, looking blank.Staring at the still face, Niall was tempted to probe her mind. But he decidedto leave it until he was alone. \"What do you think we should do with her?\"\"I'd advise you to leave her until we know more about spider poison. It maysimply work itself out of her system.\"A muffled sound, like a groan, came from Veig. He had been standing close to thedoor since they came into the room, leaning against the wall; Niall had been soabsorbed in the girl that he had paid him little attention. Now he was shockedto see that Veig's face was glistening with perspiration, and had become so palethat Niall wondered for a moment if he was about to lose consciousness. When heprobed his brother's mind, he seemed to plunge into a roaring confusion in whichVeig's heartbeats sounded like hammer blows. In this chaos, the borderlinebetween reality and a nightmarish unreality had become almost indistinguishable.Niall placed his hand on Veig's shoulder. \"Are you all right?\"Veig stared at him, but seemed hardly to recognize him. Then he looked acrossthe room, and his eyes focused on the naked girl; a puzzled look crossed hisface, as if she was an acquaintance whose name he had forgotten. A drop of sweatran, unnoticed, down the side of his nose, and lost itself in his mustache. Hebegan walking unsteadily toward the bed, his steps as heavy as if he wereclimbing a mountain. Niall and Simeon exchanged glances; Niall shook his headslightly, to indicate that he felt that Veig should be left alone. The girl laythere, naked, one arm hanging loosely by the side of the bed. It seemed to Niallthat her breathing had deepened and become faster. Veig had halted two pacesfrom the bed and was staring down at her; he was breathing through his mouth,and seemed to be in some kind of trance. Then he lunged forward, placing oneoutstretched hand on her forehead, one on her solar plexus. Simeon also startedforward; but it was unnecessary. As Veig reached the bed, his knees buckled. Hishands clawed at the air in an oddly confused way, then he collapsed on top ofthe girl. He landed so heavily that Niall was afraid he might suffocate her.Simeon obviously felt the same misgiving; he took Veig under both armpits andtried to lift him. Veig was too heavy; but he slid off the bed and rolled on thefloor, coming to rest with his face upturned to the ceiling.Niall glanced at the girl. This time there could be no doubt. She was breathingmore deeply, and there were faint spots of color in her cheeks.Simeon shook his head. \"He shouldn't have left his bed. He's in a fever.\" Heopened the door; Niall was glad to see that Crestia was standing outside. Simeonsaid: \"Get some servants and have him carried back to his chamber.\"Niall stooped beside his brother and placed his hand on his forehead. It feltsurprisingly cool. A moment later, Veig opened his eyes, and struggled into asitting position. When Simeon tried to restrain him, he shook off his handimpatiently.\"Let me alone. I'm all right.\"Simeon said: \"You fainted.\"\"No I didn't. I just tripped and fell.\" His voice was surprisingly insistent,almost angry.Simeon said soothingly: \"All right. You tripped and fell.\"A moment later, Crestia came into the room, followed by two muscular servantsfrom the kitchen. As Veig began struggling to his feet, she tried to help him;he pushed her away angrily.\"I'm all right. Let me alone.\"The girl looked appealingly at Simeon. \"The doctor says you should go back tobed.\"Niall touched his brother's arm. \"Please do as she says.\"The appeal had its effect. Veig nodded and walked toward the door, followed byCrestia. But as he went out, Niall noticed that he cast a glance back toward thebed.Niall asked: \"Do you think he'll be all right?\"\"I think so. He's suffering from some kind of recurring delirium. But it doesn'tseem too serious. I hope that girl can persuade him to stay in bed.\"Niall turned to Jarita, who was lingering in the doorway.\"Find my mother and ask her to go to my brother. Tell her that he must be madeto rest.\" As he pulled the blanket back over the girl, he noticed that her breathing wasso faint as to be almost unobservable, and that her cheeks were again withoutcolor.Simeon said: \"I'm going to the hospital. Are you coming?\"He hesitated, wondering if he should stay with Veig. Then he realized there wasnothing he could do. \"Very well.\"As they started along the corridor, Nephtys came to meet them. \"CouncilorBroadus wishes to speak to you, my lord. He's waiting below.\"\"I'm coming now.\"Simeon said in an undertone: \"That man's a terrible bore. Don't let him wastetoo much of your time.\"Broadus was standing in front of the fire in the hall, warming his hands; besidehim stood a small, bald-headed man whom Niall recognized as a Council memberfrom Dira. As Niall approached them, both made a ritual gesture of obeisance.Broadus was beaming; he was evidently well pleased with himself.\"Highness, I have made a discovery of the first importance.\"\"About Skorbo's killers?\"\"Yes, highness. I have found out where they were hiding.\"\"Excellent! Where?\"\"In a house in the slave quarter.\"Niall looked at the bald-headed man, who was shuffling uncomfortably; heremembered him as one of the less articulate Council members."},{"pageContent":"\"And your colleague?\"Broadus said offhandedly: \"Ah yes, Fergus. . . You remember Councilor Fergus?\"\"Of course.\" The bald-headed man bowed awkwardly. \"And what part did you play inthis discovery, councilor?\"\"I. . . sp-spent the evening in the slave quarter, asking about strangers.\" Thelittle man had a slight speech impediment and even his bald head blushed as hespoke. \"S-someone remembered three men and a woman who lived in a house near theriver. The door was locked, but I managed to force the lock. The place wasempty. . .\"Niall nodded. \"It would be.\"\"But there were signs that several people had been living there. And they werenot slaves.\"\"How could you tell?\"\"They had too many clothes. Most slaves only possess one garment.\"The little man was obviously intelligent as well as competent. At this pointBroadus -- who had become distinctly restive while his colleague was speaking --interrupted. \"They must have planned it all very carefully. They chose a housenear the river because they know slaves are afraid of rats. I've been to look atit and I maintain these people were not slaves.\"\"Good work. I shall commend you both at the next Council meeting.\" The littleman looked embarrassed, but Broadus glowed with satisfaction.\"Would you like us to escort you there, my lord?\"\"Not now, thank you. There's something else I have to do first. But there issomething I'd like you to do for me. Go to the headquarters of the Spider Lordand ask to see Sidonia, the captain of the guard. Tell her to send guards toprevent anyone from entering the house before I arrive.\"\"Of course, sire.\" Broadus performed his most graceful bow.Simeon waited until the door had closed behind them, then said: \"You can seewhat happened there, can't you? The little chap did all the work, and Broaduswants to take all the credit.\"\"I don't care who takes the credit. This could be the breakthrough we've beenhoping for.\" It was another sunny day, although the north wind had a cutting edge. The skywas a cold blue, and piled high with fleecy white clouds that looked as if theywere made of cotton wool. The few patches of melting snow that remained were onthe grass surrounding the white tower, and these were stained with mud. Oddlyenough, the top of the white tower, which was slightly curved, was still coveredwith a thick layer of snow, some of it projecting over the edge, like theguttering on a roof. As Niall and Simeon watched, a large slab of it camesliding off, and crashed to the ground.From the corner of the main avenue, they saw Sidonia emerge from theheadquarters of the Spider Lord, and approach Broadus and Fergus, who werewaiting on the pavement, under the gaze of two wolf spiders. Simeon said: \"Doyou really think guards are necessary?\" He grinned. \"Or was that just to get ridof Broadus?\"\"No. I'm not taking any risks. I think it would be a mistake to underestimateour opponent. He always seems to be two steps ahead of us.\"\"You seem to have done fairly well so far.\"Niall nodded. \"Yes, luck has been on our side. But it won't continue unless wecan find out who this man is and what he wants to achieve.\"Simeon asked seriously: \"You're sure he is a man?\"Niall was startled by the question. \"What else could he be?\"\"You called him a magician.\"\"Isn't that a man?\"Simeon shook his head. \"My grandmother -- goddess rest her soul -- used to saythat there are three orders of supernatural being. There are the gods who madethe Earth. Then there are nature spirits, who care for nothing but trees andlakes and mountains. Then there are the magicians, who are halfway between godsand men. Your magician sounds like that.\"Niall felt no surprise to hear Simeon speak of gods and nature spirits. He hadbecome accustomed to the fact that even the servants of the bombardier beetlestook such beliefs for granted. In fact, Niall himself had shared them until theSteegmaster had taken his education in hand.\"All the same, I don't believe he's a supernatural being.\"\"Then what is he?\"\"A man. A spiteful and ruthless man, but a man nevertheless.\"Simeon gave him a sidelong glance. \"You sound as if you know all about him.\"Niall said: \"I think I have even seen him.\"Simeon stared at him with amazement. \"You've what?\"Niall hastened to explain: \"It was only in a dream.\"\"And what did he look like?\"\"He had a forked beard\" -- Niall tried to indicate its shape under his chin --\"and his face was hidden in a black hood.\"Simeon nodded, his face serious. \"That sounds like a magician all right. Mygrandmother used to say they're twice as clever as a human being and twice asvindictive. She used to say she'd rather tease a swamp cobra.\"As he spoke, Niall experienced a peculiar sensation, as if a cloud had coveredthe sun. They walked the remaining distance to the hospital in silence, eachpreoccupied with his own thoughts.Two four-wheel carts stood at the side entrance, one empty, the other containingthree bodies wrapped in their cocoons of spider web. Niall observed thatpedestrians averted their eyes and hurried past, as if afraid of beingcontaminated by the sight. It reminded him that, in this city, most of the humanbeings still preferred not to know the secrets of their former masters.Overhead, on a web that stretched across the street, a brown and black-stripedhunting spider looked down curiously, probably wondering why good meat was beingallowed to go to waste. A massively built workman came out of the yard, slung abody over his shoulders like a sack of potatoes, and carried it inside.The unconscious bodies had been laid out on trestle tables in a large room nextto the women's ward. A tall young man with shoulder-length dark hair was cuttingopen a cocoon of web with an enormous pair of scissors. When he saw them, Niallexperienced a tingling of the scalp; these were altogether more like thescissors of his dream.Simeon said: \"I don't think you've met Phelim -- my nephew and assistant.\"Niall and Phelim shook hands. The young man's face was not handsome, but withhis deep-set eyes and irregular nose, was full of character. He had a powerfulgrip and an open, friendly smile. Niall was glad that he made no attempt to bow.Simeon asked: \"Anything to report?\"\"Only this.\" He approached the body of a man wearing a slave uniform, and tuggedat a chain that hung round his neck. \"Any idea what this is?\" He dangled apendant between his thumb and forefinger.Niall and Simeon exchanged glances. Simeon asked: \"Have you found any more ofthem?\"Phelim shook his head. \"No. What is it?\"Simeon was tugging the remainder of the cocoon off the man's feet, then thesandals. He pulled open the toes; Niall could see the scar tissue where the webbetween the toes had been severed.Niall said: \"It's a communicating device.\"Phelim looked blank. \"Are you joking?\" A moment later he gave a slight start anddropped the pendant.\"Why did you do that?\"\"Oh, nothing.\" He touched the pendant gingerly with his fingertip. \"I thought Igot a tingling feeling. . .\"Niall picked it up; it felt completely inert.Phelim turned to his uncle and asked with mild exasperation: \"What on earth'shappening here?\"Simeon explained to Niall: \"He only arrived a couple of hours ago. I haven't hada chance to tell him.\" He took the scissors from Phelim and used them to cut offthe slave tunic. The naked body was that of a man of about thirty. His breathingwas faint but distinctly perceptible. The face bore a family resemblance to theothers Niall had seen: a beaklike nose, a lined forehead, an oddly large andsensuous mouth, and a receding chin which, in spite of its lack of prominence,somehow conveyed no impression of weakness. The body looked hard and muscular,but the flesh was very pale. The black hairs that covered the chest and legsgave him an animal-like appearance.Simeon reached out to the hairy midriff and removed a tiny brown fragment thatlooked like a piece of dried leaf.Phelim asked: \"What is it?\"Simeon handed it to him. \"What do you think?\"Phelim sniffed it. \"Seaweed? Has he been swimming?\"Simeon said: \"That's what we'd both like to know.\"Niall was staring at the immobile face, and at the yellow teeth that were justvisible through the partly open lips. He placed one hand on the lined forehead,and experienced an odd sense of repulsion as he felt the cold flesh. Then,ignoring the others, he allowed his mind to become a blank and to blend with theconsciousness of the sleeper. There was the oddly familiar sensation that heknew from past experience: of losing his own identity and becoming someone else.But since this man was unconscious, the \"someone else\" was a kind of blankness,like hovering in empty space. Niall had to reach out and hold on to the edge ofthe table to steady himself. After a few moments, his mind seemed to becomeaccustomed to the blankness, as the eyes become accustomed to darkness. Therewere faint flashes in the darkness, like distant lightning; Niall assumed theseto be some kind of electrical activity in the man's brain. Then, to hissurprise, there was a crash like a distant roll of thunder. A moment later, thedarkness began to give way to a pale blue light, which seemed to vibrate whenthere was another crash of thunder. A strange landscape became dimly visible, asif seen from a great height. Niall almost ceased breathing, suddenly gripped bythe certainty that he was about to learn something important.Then two things happened. He experienced a sickening sensation that reminded himof a bad smell -- the same smell he had experienced when probing the mind ofSkorbo's assassin -- and at the same time he felt his consciousness hurledoutward, as if by an explosion, and ejected violently and suddenly from thebrain of the stranger; it was as if some powerful force had gripped him andthrown him through the air. There was a sharp pain in his eyeballs, as if theywere being forced out of his head, and the nausea struck his solar plexus likethe blow of a fist. Simeon and Phelim, who had been watching him in silence, sawhim gasp and stagger backwards. Phelim caught him as his knees buckled.When he opened his eyes he was lying on one of the trestle tables, and Phelimwas taking his pulse. He heard Simeon say: \"He's dead.\"\"No I'm not.\"Simeon said: \"He is.\" He pointed at the body of the man. Niall forced himselfupright, fighting off the nausea that spread upward from his stomach, andlurched off the table, supported by Phelim's hand on his arm. He could see at aglance that Simeon was right. The dead eyes stared glassily at the ceiling. Thejaw had sagged open, and the hairy chest had ceased to rise and fall.Niall groaned and struck himself on the forehead with his fist. \"What an idiot Iam!\" He tore the chain from around the man's neck and hurled it across the room.Phelim shook his head in bewilderment. \"Would someone tell me what's happening?\"Niall said bitterly: \"I killed him out of pure stupidity, that's what.\"Simeon laid a hand on his shoulder. \"It wasn't your fault.\"\"Oh yes it was. I should have removed the pendant first.\"He looked down at the dead face, with its yellow teeth. \"He can kill from adistance.\"Phelim asked: \"Who can?\"\"The man who sent him. The magician.\"Phelim looked at Niall in blank astonishment. \"A real magician?\"Simeon said quickly: \"I'll explain it all later.\"\"But. . .\"\"We've other things to do now.\"Phelim was obviously troubled. \"I'd still like to know what killed him.\"\"If you want my guess, a heart attack.\" Simeon reached out and closed thestaring eyes.\"But I thought. . .\"Simeon silenced him with a gesture. \"Before we do anything else, let's get therest of these webs off. I want to see if there are any more pendants.\"Ten minutes later, the spider silk had been removed from the remaining bodies.There were fourteen in all, and their garments made it obvious that all camefrom the spider city. Their faces made it even plainer; all had the striking butsomehow vapid good looks of human beings who have been deliberately bred forbeauty and stupidity. Three of them were workmen, four adult women, and sevenyouths and girls -- some hardly more than children. Phelim pointed out that eachof them had fang marks on the neck or shoulders: evidence that they had beenattacked from above.Niall watched all this in a state of angry self-reproach; he was still cursinghimself for his stupidity. When the last of the webs lay on the floor, Phelimsaid: \"No more pendants.\"Simeon voiced what Niall was thinking. \"That means the girl is the last onealive. We must guard her carefully.\"\"Or better still, find some way of waking her up.\"Phelim said: \"How about the viper serum?\"Simeon considered it. \"Yes, I suppose it might work. It's worth trying, anyway.\"Niall asked: \"But what does it do?\"\"It's an antidote to the poison of the horned marsh viper. I made it byinjecting a horse with the venom until it built up a resistance -- it cured mywife in the Great Delta. The poison of the marsh viper has roughly the sameeffect as spider venom -- a small quantity causes paralysis, a large quantitycauses death.\"\"But what if it killed her?\"\"Why should it? The poison in a serum is already neutralized. In any case, wecould try it on one of these sleeping beauties first.\" He turned to Phelim.\"Help me find one with a good, strong pulse.\"Phelim lifted the wrist of the girl closest to him. \"How about this?\"Simeon took her other wrist, and nodded. Then he opened her eyelid, and verydelicately touched her eyeball with his fingertip. Niall thought the girl'sother eyelid twitched.From a wooden medical chest Simeon took an instrument that Niall recognized as ahypodermic syringe. He had never seen one, but his history lesson in the whitetower had made him familiar with their use. Simeon guessed what he was thinking.\"I'd never seen one either.\" He held it out for Niall's inspection. \"Beautiful,aren't they? One of these would have saved the life of my father. Now we've gotsix dozen.\"A voice said: \"Twelve dozen.\" A boy of about fourteen had come into the room.His dark hair was close-cropped; otherwise he bore a striking resemblance toPhelim.\"You've found more? Good.\" Simeon placed a hand on the boy's shoulder. \"This ismy nephew Boyd, the mechanical genius of the family.\"Boyd said: \"And guess what I've found? An electric generator. Isn't thattremendous?\"Phelim snorted. \"It would be if we had any use for electricity.\"\"Any use?\" Boyd's tone was outraged. \"What do you mean, any use?\"Phelim said: \"Well, you tell me what we can use it for.\"\"Well, lighting this place to begin with. That's what it's for. It's anemergency generator. Don't you know anything?\" It was obvious that the brothersmaintained an attitude of mutual criticism.Simeon said: \"Never mind him. I think it's wonderful. What have you got there?\"Boyd was holding a curved metal band of a pale gold color. \"I'm not sure. It'seither a bipartite encephaloscope or a Gullstrand apparatus. I thought you mightknow.\"Phelim took it from his brother. \"It looks like an ordinary headband to me.\"This was true; it reminded Niall of the kind of band Merlew wore ho keep herhair in place. Yet there was something about its pale gold color and gracefulform that fascinated him.Simeon said: \"Why don't you go and look it up in the big medical encyclopedia?Have you finished unpacking?\"\"Of course not. There's a whole crate yet.\"\"Well, go and finish it. We'll come up in a moment.\"Boyd turned to Niall. \"Do you want to come?\" It was the first time he hadacknowledged Niall's existence.Simeon said: \"No, he'll come up with us. Go and unpack the other crate.\"Boyd exchanged a glance with Niall and pulled a wry face. As he ran off down thecorridor, Phelim said resignedly: \"My younger brother is brilliant, but he's aterrible pest.\"In fact, Niall had taken an instant liking to the boy, whose eyes radiatedintelligence.Simeon had already turned back to the girl, and was studying her forearm. \"Giveme the viper serum.\"Phelim handed him a small glass bottle containing a yellow fluid. But as Simeonfilled the syringe, Niall experienced an odd sense of misgiving.\"Wouldn't it be safer to try a small quantity first?\"Simeon shrugged. \"It shouldn't do any harm. But perhaps you're right -- I don'twant to waste the serum.\" He squeezed some of it back into the bottle bypressing the plunger.Niall looked down at the girl's sleeping face. She was a pretty, dark-hairedteenager with an olive skin and full lips. There was something very attractiveabout its serenity. Almost without being aware of it, his consciousness passedbeyond her sleeping face and into her brain. It was like plunging into a sea ofoblivion, total absence of being. Through this nothingness, Niall continued tobe aware of his own body, standing there and looking down at her. Yet he was nolonger inside his body. Nor did he possess any identity. He was like a newbornbaby, gazing blankly out on the world.Yet this consciousness of nothingness was dimly illuminated by flashes ofsomethingness, like a faint dawn on the horizon. This was the girl's sleepingconsciousness, dimly aware of her body and of the room she was lying in. Thisvague, almost nonexistent consciousness became momentarily more aware as Simeondrove the needle into her arm and pressed the plunger.Simeon said: \"Do you realize this is the first time in a thousand years that oneof these things has been used?\"His voice produced a slight shock that brought Niall back into his body. It waspleasant to reenter his own identity and to become aware that he was Niall, andnot a fragment of nothingness.The three of them stood there in silence, looking down at the girl's face, andat the rising and falling of her breasts. After about a minute her breathingbecame faster, and spots of color appeared in her cheeks.Phelim said: \"It's working.\"Simeon shook his head. \"Don't speak too soon.\"As he said this, Niall once again probed the girl's mind. As soon as he did so,he realized that something was wrong. There was an acute sense of discomfort, afeeling of suffocation, and a scalding sensation in his veins. The waves ofdelirium made him feel so unbalanced that he hastily withdrew.The girl was now breathing fast, as though in a fever, and Simeon was beginningto look concerned. Phelim reached out and raised her eyelid. Niall could seethat the eye was moving around rapidly, showing the white of the eyeball; theeffect was unpleasant, as though she were a frightened animal. Simeon, who washolding her wrist, shook his head.\"You were right. Thank heavens I didn't give her a larger dose.\"\"What happened?\"\"I don't know. The two neurotoxins may have opposed one another.\"Phelim took another bottle from the medicine chest. \"How about belladonna?\"Simeon shook his head emphatically. \"Fatal. Atropine stimulates the heart andher pulse is already a hundred and thirty. Hyoscin might work. But I don't wantto take any more risks.\" He dropped the wrist. \"I think she'll be all right.\"But Niall, who was aware of the feverish tumult in the girl's brain, was lessconfident. Even to share her consciousness at second hand produced a burningsensation of thirst and an irrational longing to plunge into cold water.Simeon said: \"There's nothing more we can do for now. Let's go and see howBoyd's getting on.\"It was a relief to follow him out of the room. It was not until Niall washalfway along the corridor that the burning sensation disappeared.The large room at the top of the stairs had been recently vacated by thecarpenters, and smelled of freshly sawed wood and varnish. The five packingcases from the warehouse now stood against the wall; the floor and two largetrestle tables were covered with an assortment of objects, from rolls ofbandages and cotton wool to strange items of medical equipment that remindedNiall of things seen in the control room of the white tower.Boyd was enthusiastically levering the lid off a packing case with a crowbar. Hepointed to a large satinwood box on the floor. \"That's an electron microscope.Do you know how many times it can magnify?\" Phelim shook his head. \"Half amillion!\" He pointed to a gleaming chromium-plated device on the table. \"That'sa comparison microscope.\" He touched a button at its base, and a small butpowerful light came on, illuminating the slide-holder.Phelim was astonished. \"What made it light up?\"Boyd said scornfully: \"A battery, of course. By the twenty-second century they'dinvented batteries that could store a thousand volts. How about this?\" He pickedup a black tube from the table and pushed a button; a powerful beam of lightshone on the opposite wall. Boyd pointed it at Phelim's face, and twisted thebase; the light became so blinding that Phelim covered his eyes with his hands.\"Isn't that marvelous? An emergency operating-theatre light. . . And look atthis.\" He opened a polythene box and took out a flat device with a handle at thecenter of its base. It was about a foot square, and seemed to be made of cloudyglass.\"What is it?\"\"A portable X ray.\" He turned to Niall. \"Put your hand on the table.\"Niall did as he was told. Boyd held the clouded glass above it, then squeezed aswitch. A pale green light illuminated the glass. Niall gazed with astonishmentas his flesh disappeared, and he found himself looking at the hand of askeleton. Boyd chortled with delight, and held the device up against Phelim'sface; Phelim's head immediately turned into a grinning skull with empty eyesockets. As Phelim started to move away, Boyd said: \"Hold still a minute.\" Usingboth hands, he pushed a slide on the handle. Phelim's head became slowly clothedwith flesh -- not normal flesh, but a kind of semitransparent jelly in which allthe veins and arteries were clearly visible. Inside the skull, it was possibleto see the outline of Phelim's brain. \"There, you see, uncle, you were wrong --Phelim has got a brain.\" He ducked a playful blow from Phelim.Niall picked up a gleaming metal tube from the tabletop; it was a foot long andtwo inches in diameter. It reminded him of the expanding metal rod he had foundin the land of Dira. Like the metal rod, it was startlingly heavy for its size.One end was covered with a frosted glass screen, and the control button on itsside rested in a graduated slot. When Niall pushed the button upward, the glasswas illuminated with a green glow.He asked Boyd: \"What's this?\"\"I'm not sure.\" It obviously pained him to admit ignorance. \"Some kind oftorch?\"Niall shone it on the palm of his hand. To his surprise, the green lightproduced a pleasant, cool sensation not unlike a breeze. As he pushed the buttonupwards in its slot, the light intensified, and his hand became increasinglycold. Before the button had reached the halfway mark, his hand felt frozen, asif immersed in icy water. Even when he turned the light away, the flesh remainedachingly cold, so that it was difficult to move his fingers. He whistled withpain. \"That's freezing!\"Boyd said: \"Ah, now I know what it is. It's a cold light. They were invented toreplace refrigerators.\"Phelim was studying a large sheet of paper. \"Yes, it's here on the inventory --Rykov Dethermalizer or cold light. What's an otoscope?\"Boyd said: \"A thing for looking in your ear.\"\"What's an electrodiagnostic analyzer?\"\"I don't know.\"\"Well, there should be one in here somewhere. And a Gullstrand apparatus,whatever that is. . .\"Niall was no longer paying attention. As the freezing sensation graduallydisappeared from his hand, he was struck by an interesting idea. While theothers were bent over the packing case, he slipped out of the room and tiptoeddownstairs.The girl was now in a fever; her cheeks were flushed, and she was breathing inshort gasps. Niall placed the cold light gently against her damp forehead, andpushed the switch. As he did so, his consciousness blended with hers, and hefelt her shock wave of relief as the sudden coolness invaded her brain. Withinthirty seconds, the flood of emergency signals that had overloaded her nervoussystem had diminished to a trickle, and her breathing was calmer. Yet as hecontinued to hold the cold light against her forehead, Niall was aware that hewas treating only the symptoms, not the cause of the problem. Her nervous systemwas in shock as a result of the reaction between the spider venom and the snakeserum. And after six weeks of hanging upside down in Skorbo's larder, hervitality was too depleted to cope with the crisis. Even as her heartbeat sloweddown, Niall was aware that she lacked the strength to fight off this newinvasion of poison that Simeon had introduced into her bloodstream. Trapped inthe confused electrical storm of her consciousness, Niall felt completelyhelpless.Yet when he was once again looking down at her flushed face, he experienced asurge of anger at this pointless waste of her life. It seemed absurd that therewas no way in which he could transfer some of his own excess vitality into herbody. On a sudden impulse he switched off the cold light and placed one hand onher forehead and the other on her solar plexus. In doing so, he was consciouslyimitating the posture he had seen his brother adopt earlier that morning. Herecognized immediately that it established a sense of contact between theirphysical organisms. As his consciousness blended with hers, he instinctivelysynchronized their vibrations so she could absorb the energy he was trying togive her. A warm sensation flowed down his arms and through his fingertips. Andsince the sense of contact was still inadequate, he bent over and pressed hismouth against hers. Her lips were dry, so he moistened them with his tongue. Andnow that contact was fully established, her body responded to the flow of vitalenergy as parched ground responds to water. It was a curious sensation --allowing his vitality to be sucked into the vortex of her need. It felt as iftheir sexes had been reversed, and that he had become the female, she the male.Then, just as the strain of the position was beginning to turn into physicaldiscomfort, he felt the power inside her respond to the power that was flowingout of his own body; like waterlogged soil she had taken as much of his vitalityas she could absorb. A moment later, he felt her lips move, and knew she wasreturning to consciousness. As he straightened up, he experienced a suddendizziness that made him sway on his feet and grip the edge of the table. Thedarkness passed, and he saw that her eyes were open. He smiled at her, but shestared back blankly, without recognition. Then she sighed deeply and closed hereyes as the weakened spider venom once more plunged her nervous system into astate of paralysis.When the others came into the room a few minutes later, she was breathingnormally and peacefully. Simeon noticed the change immediately.\"Hello, she's looking much better.\" He took her wrist. \"Yes, her pulse is backto normal.\"Niall said: \"I think your serum must have worked after all.\"Simeon gave him a suspicious glance from under his bushy eyebrows, but saidnothing. His charioteers were waiting for him when he came out of the hospital. He wasgrateful to them for their foresight; the events of the past half-hour hadfilled him with a dreamy but not unpleasant tiredness. He told them to take himto the slave quarter, then, with a sigh of gratitude, relaxed into the cushions,wishing the journey ahead was longer.In spite of the tiredness, he was in a curious state of inner excitement. Theworld around him seemed marvelously fresh and real. This, he realized, wasbecause he had made a voyage outside his own body and into the mind of theunconscious girl; now his own identity seemed new and strange, like a suit ofnew clothes.This excursion into the mind of a stranger had also made him aware once again ofthe odd mental vacuity of these citizens of the spider city. The spiders hadgone to a great deal of trouble to breed all the imagination out of their humanservants. Yet what had intrigued him about the girl was that, in spite of herlack of imagination, she was obviously happy -- like the crowds of people whowere now enjoying the sunlight in the main square, or strolling down thetree-lined avenue that led to the river, mingling freely with wolf spiders and afew bombardier beetles. She had never been outside the spider city, yet she wascontented with her lot in life. And was he, in spite of his imagination, so muchbetter off? He had freed his fellow humans from their slavery, and he was theruler of this spider city. Yet in spite of this, he continued to experience anobscure feeling of discontentment, almost of anticlimax.Oddly enough, these thoughts caused him no distress. On the contrary, as thecart crossed the bridge that led to the slave quarter, he experienced a curiousfeeling of satisfaction, as if he was at last coming to grips with the problem.If he was not to surrender to the mindless contentment of the spider servants,then he had to learn to develop his own deeper sense of purpose. And what hadjust happened seemed to offer him a clue: to leave his own body behind, to beable to float freely in the open space that exists around all human beings. . .The charioteers paused on the far side of the bridge. \"Which way, highness?\"Broadus had not given precise instructions, but he had said that the house facedthe river. Niall said: \"Turn right here.\"Half a mile to the east, the explosion of a vast underground ammunition storehad destroyed a large area of the slave quarter, and the river flowed into thecrater, forming a lake. Bloated bodies still occasionally floated to itssurface, to be fought over by the razor-bill gulls who had now come to nestaround its edges. These gulls, whose wingspan was more than two feet,occasionally attacked children, and had stolen at least one baby from itscarriage, which had been left outside a front door; for this reason -- and alsobecause they were afraid of the rats, who were as big as small dogs -- theslaves had moved away from the houses adjoining the lake. This suggested toNiall that men who wished to remain unnoticed might choose the roughlytriangular area bounded by the lake to the east and the river to the south.Most of the houses along this riverfront area were damaged; some had lost theirroofs, most had broken windows. If the ammunition store had not been so deep andso well protected, the explosion would have destroyed half the city. Now, asthey approached the lake, and a few curious gulls squawked and soared abovethem, Niall observed that one of the birds was behaving in an unusual manner. Itwas swooping upward, turning a backward somersault, then losing control andfluttering frantically toward the ground before it readjusted itself and soaredagain on outspread wings. When it carried out this strange maneuver a thirdtime, the other gulls took fright and flew off toward the lake, leaving theircompanion to swoop upward and repeat the same clumsy and incongruous somersault,squawking with alarm. This time it failed to regain control and crashed into achimney, then rolled, bumping, down the side of a roof. Niall observed the spotwhere it had disappeared from sight.\"Turn left at the next street.\"A few white feathers showed where the gull had hit the pavement; the bird itselfwas now in the mandibles of a wolf spider, which was standing guard outside ahouse a few yards down the road. Niall had guessed he would find it there; thegull's behavior could only be explained in terms of a bored wolf spiderindulging its sense of humor. (Wolf spiders were hunters who enjoyed swiftmovement, and lacked the immense patience of other species.) It was now soabsorbed in its prospective meal that it failed to notice their approach, andstarted nervously as they moved into its field of vision. When it recognizedNiall -- telepathically rather than visually -- it dropped its prey and made aclumsy gesture of obeisance; the bird squawked and fluttered feebly. Niallpretended not to notice the spider's embarrassment, and hurried past it throughthe open front door.He noticed immediately the tidiness of the hallway. Although large slabs ofplaster were missing from the walls, and the floorboards were worn and uneven,the floor itself looked as if it had been scrubbed. For a house in the slavequarter, this was unusual; slaves were notoriously untidy, and even slave womenwere sluttish housewives. The next thing he observed was the smell -- a smellthat for a moment eluded him, because he had encountered it late in life. Thenhe remembered: it was the iodine-like smell of seaweed, and it seemed to blendnaturally with the cry of the gulls above the rooftops.He tried the nearest door, which should have led into the front room; it waslocked or jammed. But the next door stood slightly ajar. He found himself in alarge room whose floor space was almost entirely occupied by furniture -- fourbeds, several chairs, and a chest of drawers. Otherwise, it was a bare,uncomfortable-looking room, like most other bedrooms in the slave quarter. Itdiffered in only one respect; the beds had been tidily made up, and the floorspace between them looked as if it had been scrubbed. Like the hallway, it had adistinctive sea smell.He found himself unable to suppress a feeling of disappointment. The room seemedto contain no personal belongings, nothing to offer a clue to those who hadlived in it. At this point, he recalled a remark of the bald-headed littlecouncilor, Fergus: that these people could not have been slaves because theypossessed too many clothes. He picked his way between the beds -- there wasbarely space to walk -- toward the chest of drawers in the corner. Halfwayacross the room, he halted and listened intently: a faint creaking offloorboards had sounded from the room above. A few moments later, soft footstepsdescended the stairs. Niall groped in his pocket, cursing himself for notbringing the expanding metal rod or some other weapon. For a moment heconsidered lying between the beds, then realized that, in the silence of thehouse, the creak of the floorboards was bound to give him away. A moment later,alarm turned to relief as the huge body of a spider blocked the doorway.\"Dravig! What are you doing here?\"Dravig was able to sense his relief. \"I apologize for alarming you. I was withthe Death Lord when your message arrived. He ordered me to see what you haddiscovered.\"\"This is the hideout of Skorbo's killers.\" Niall looked around the bare room.\"Did you find anything upstairs?\"\"Nothing. The rooms are unused.\"\"Then for some reason, they all lived in this room. Probably because they didn'twant to draw attention to themselves. Look at the windows.\" Dravig did so, butobviously failed to comprehend. \"They're thick with dust, yet the room itself isspotlessly clean. Clean windows might have given them away -- slaves never cleanwindows.\"He crossed to the chest of drawers, and pulled open the top one. Inside, as hehad half-expected, were slave garments, neatly folded. He pulled these out inarmfuls and tossed them onto the nearest bed. The drawer contained nothing else.The second drawer also contained slave garments, and several pairs of sandals;Niall was intrigued to observe that, unlike the sandals usually worn by slaves,these were of excellent workmanship. They might have been made by the workmen ofDira.Under these, at the back of the drawer, lay five small objects, wrappedindividually in cloth. When Niall touched one of them, he observed that thematerial was damp. Inside the cloth was a layer of brown seaweed, like thefragments Niall had already seen on the flesh of the unconscious girl. When thiswas removed, he found himself looking at an object made of smooth green stone.It was about two inches high, and his first impression was that it was a carvingof a frog or toad. It was a small, squat creature with bulbous eyes, a flat faceand a large slack mouth. As a desert dweller, Niall had seen very few frogs ortoads; but this one struck him as too humanoid for either. To begin with, thetiny feet on which it supported itself looked more like human hands, althoughthey had webbing between the fingers. The fat little belly had a navel, and thechest had two diminutive nipples. What struck Niall as most intriguing was thatboth the bulging eyes had darker patches of green that might have been pupils.These seemed to be a natural part of the stone; it must have taken the sculptora long time to find a stone with two such dark patches in exactly the rightplace.He held it out to Dravig. \"What do you think this is?\"Dravig reached out both feelers, then quickly withdrew them. \"Do not touch it.Put it back.\"\"Why?\" Niall stared at him in surprise.\"Can you not feel it?\"Niall withdrew into the still center of his mind and opened all his senses. Now,suddenly, he understood what Dravig meant. There was something strange about theobject in his hand, a kind of force or energy that was not unlike the force of aliving creature. And as he looked at the toadlike face, it now seemed oddlymalevolent -- although a better word might have been predatory, like a hunterlying in wait and watching the approach of its victim. Niall had observed itmany times among the carnivorous plants of the Great Delta. Even so, theemanation from the stone was mild, almost undetectable; Dravig must havepossessed remarkable sensitivity to observe this without even touching it.Niall rewrapped it and replaced it in the drawer. Then, one by one, he removedthe others and unwrapped them. Each, he observed, had been placed with its facetoward the back of the drawer. Each was subtly different from the others,although there was a strong basic resemblance. Some had more humanoid faces thanothers, and one had an open mouth inside which teeth were visible. But theseteeth were like no others that Niall had ever seen. They were not triangular andpointed, like the teeth of a fish, nor flat like those of a herbivore, but acombination of the two, with oddly irregular points. One figure had a curiousprotuberance, not unlike a short trunk, and one had closed eyes, although theface seemed to have the same vaguely menacing watchfulness as the others.Dravig watched all this with an air of doubt that amounted to disapproval. Niallwas aware that he seemed to feel that all this curiosity was unnecessary, almostindecent -- much as humans might feel about ransacking someone's personalpossessions. Once again he was struck by the alienness of the spider mind, itsstrange lack of curiosity. Spiders were intelligent and observant; yet theyseemed to have very little of the natural inquisitiveness of human beings.He asked Dravig: \"Why do you suppose they keep their lucky charms wrapped inseaweed?\"Dravig replied: \"They are not lucky charms. They are their personal gods.\"Now, suddenly, Niall understood. Spiders had a highly developed sense of theunknown forces of nature, and a boundless awe for the great goddess. This waswhy Niall himself was now treated as a kind of god; the spiders regarded him asan emissary of the goddess. Dravig was perturbed because Niall was failing todisplay respect for sacred things. Yet his disapproval was muted since Niallhimself shared their sacred nature.Niall carefully rewrapped the last of the images, and replaced it in the drawer.\"I'd still like to know why they wrap them in seaweed. I thought they livedunderground.\"He was trying to open the bottom drawer, but it yielded only with difficulty;its wood seemed to be swollen and damp. The drawer proved to contain a flatwooden box, about eighteen inches long and a foot wide. Niall had often comeacross such boxes in the kitchens of deserted houses, during the hours oframbling exploration; they usually contained cutlery, although on one occasionhe had found one full of small bottles containing herbs and condiments. Heplaced this one on top of the chest of drawers and pushed up its catch. ToNiall's surprise, it proved to contain nothing but a mass of brown seaweed and aquantity of liquid, presumably sea water. The iodine-smell of the weed filledthe room. He lifted a corner of the weed and looked underneath; there wasnothing. But he noted that the inside of the box had been treated with some graysubstance that looked slimy, but was, in fact, quite hard to the touch; it wasevidently intended as waterproofing. The weed itself had a slippery, leatheryconsistency, and as he raised it, he noted that it was not, as he had firstthought, a mass of separate leaves, but a single sheet of weed. When he liftedit in the air, holding it in both hands, it became clear that it was a roughlyrectangular mat which had been folded in two. One side of the mat was smooth andleathery; the other side consisted of sucker-shaped buds, each one about half aninch across. At the edge of the mat there were a number of trailing stems ortendrils; these made it clear that this was a single piece of natural weed whichhad been removed in its entirety.He held it out toward Dravig, its water dripping onto the floor. \"What do youmake of that? What do you suppose they did with a piece of seaweed?\" Dravig madea mental gesture that was like a head-shake. Niall replaced it in the box andclosed down the lid. When he rubbed his wet hands down his tunic, he noticedthat a few fragments of brown weed stuck to the cloth.The rest of the room yielded no further clues. A cupboard in the corner provedto be empty except for two grubby slave tunics. Niall tossed these onto the bedwith the others, then looked through the pockets. As he had expected, these wereempty. Finally, he left the room and explored the rest of the ground floor. Whenthe locked door of the front room failed to yield to a determined push, heturned the handle, and rammed it with his shoulder. The door burst open. But theroom, as he had expected, contained only dusty furniture, and had evidently notbeen used for a long time, possibly centuries. All the windows were broken, andshards of glass still lay on the floor.Since this was a small house, the only other room on the ground floor was thekitchen. This proved to be spotlessly clean, and the few cups and dishes hadbeen washed and left to drain. A dish towel hung from a rack above the sink, andtwo dish cloths had been spread out to dry from the edge of the draining board.Saucepans and other utensils were upside down on a shelf. The stove containedburnt wood ash. A waste bin underneath the sink was half full of decayingremains of vegetables and some rabbit bones.The kitchen drawers contained knives, forks, and other implements, some of themrusty and evidently dating back to the days when humans ruled the earth. Thecupboard underneath was locked, and an attempt to force it open with a rustypair of scissors only broke the blade of the scissors. But by removing thedrawers, Niall was able to look down into the cupboard; in the middle of the topshelf lay a key. He tried it in the lock; the cupboard door opened. His firstimpression was that it was empty. Yet in that case, why hide the key? Kneelingon the floor, he peered sideways into the bottom shelf, and gave a grunt ofsatisfaction. In the far corner there was a small wooden box, which had beenplaced so far back that he was able to reach it only with his fingertips. Itproved to be a few inches square, and made of a black, polished wood. Whatpuzzled him was that it appeared to have no lid; there were no hinges and nosign of a catch. It took him several minutes of careful study to realize that ithad a sliding lid, so carefully crafted that its groove was virtually invisible.When he placed his hand firmly on the lid and pushed, it slid open. Inside,there was a brown glass bottle, and a curious device whose purpose eluded him.It was made of the quill of a bird, and one end was sharpened to a point; theother was covered with a small bulb made of a rubberlike substance. Nialluncorked the bottle and sniffed it; the liquid inside had a medical smell. Hedipped the quill into it and squeezed the bulb; a yellow liquid was drawn upinto the tube. But he still found it impossible to guess why the end waspointed. After squeezing the liquid back into the bottle, he replaced them inthe box, and dropped it into the pocket of his tunic. Simeon would certainlyfind it interesting.He concluded by looking at the upstairs rooms. But these, as Dravig had said,were empty and showed no sign of occupation; except for Dravig's footprints, thedust on the floors was undisturbed.Back in the bedroom, Dravig was waiting with that infinite patience Niall foundso admirable -- he had apparently not even changed his position since Niall leftthe room. Niall sat down heavily on one of the beds and surveyed the room.Dravig could sense his frustration. He asked with carefully controlled courtesy-- so as not to imply that Niall had been wasting his time: \"What message shallI take to the Death Lord?\"Niall sighed. \"You mean what have I learned? Not much, I'm afraid.\" Dravig'smind transmitted a wordless sympathy; in fact, the direct communication betweenthem meant that his sympathy was plainer than words. Niall said: \"All I can tellyou is this. There were five of them here, but not all at the same time, sincethere are only four beds. It was a carefully planned expedition.\" He pointed togarments on the bed. \"Some of those slave tunics were manufactured for thejourney. If you look at them closely, you'll see that they're made of a finermaterial than these\" -- he pointed to the soiled slave tunics -- \"which are thereal thing. As soon as they could obtain real slave garments, they put theirtraveling clothes in a drawer. Someone might have noticed the difference. Andthey were anxious not to draw attention to themselves. That's why they left thewindows uncleaned and why they haven't attempted to board up the front windows.Instead, they kept the inner door locked, in case someone climbed in through thebroken window.\"Dravig had been listening with deep attention. \"Your powers of observation areremarkable. How did you come to develop them?\"\"All hunters have to develop them or their catch would be poor. But in this caseobservation is less important than reason. You notice, for example, that thesepeople were obsessively tidy -- these floorboards have been scrubbed untilthey're almost white. That reveals immediately that they were not slaves. Andanyone who came into this room would realize it. So why did they not avoid thatrisk and leave the place as untidy as most slave dwellings? Because they havebeen trained to be tidy. To live in an untidy room would be worse thandiscovery.\"Dravig said: \"But they also had a woman who had nothing else to do. Slave womenstay at home all day.\"Niall shook his head. \"You forget that she had already been captured by Skorbo.Only men lived in this room the past few weeks, yet they have continued to keepit tidy.\" He pointed to the soiled slave tunics. \"These were probably left inthe cupboard, waiting to be washed, on the morning they set out to assassinateSkorbo.\"He was struck suddenly by another thought. \"On that morning, there were onlythree of them left. Two were hanging up in Skorbo's larder. Is that why Skorbowas chosen as the victim -- because they knew that he was responsible for thedisappearance of the other two? That would explain something that has beenpuzzling me. The tree that killed Skorbo must have been planted at least a yearago, probably more. And at that time, they had no reason to kill Skorbo -- hewas simply the captain of the Death Lord's personal bodyguard.\"\"Then who was the chosen victim?\"\"You.\"\"I?\" It was the first time that Niall had seen Dravig taken aback.Niall laughed. \"I am only guessing. But who else? The Death Lord never leaveshis headquarters. Next to him, you are the most distinguished spider in thecity.\"\"But why should they want to kill me?\"\"Why should they want to kill anyone? I believe these people are driven -- orrather, that their leader is driven by a consuming hatred of the spiders andtheir servants.\"\"But what could they hope to achieve?\"Niall realized, with wry amusement, that Dravig was beginning to credit him withsome almost supernatural insight.\"We can only guess. If they hate your people, then presumably their ultimatedesire is to destroy them, and to take their place as the rulers of the Earth.\"Here Niall was drawing upon his own memory of lifelong hatred of the spiders.But if Dravig guessed this, he was far too tactful to allow it to show. He onlysaid mildly: \"It is difficult to see how that could be accomplished.\"Niall shrugged. \"Whatever their plans, my guess is that Skorbo spoiled them. Sothey sent for reinforcements and decided to make Skorbo their first victim. Andat that point, everything began to go wrong. Skorbo killed one of them and theyhad to conceal the body. They removed his clothes so we wouldn't guess he waspretending to be a slave. But by then, Skorbo had dragged himself out into thesquare and raised the alarm. They couldn't escape through the fresh snow withoutleaving a trail. So they tried to blend with the squad of slaves outside. Evenat that point they might still have escaped -- in fact, one of them did manageto slip away without being noticed. Fortunately, Simeon guessed what hadhappened, and we caught the other one at the hospital.\"Dravig said: \"And now they are all dead.\"\"Not all. There is still the girl.\"\"Ah yes. I still cannot understand what part the girl played in their plans.\"Niall shook his head. \"Neither can I. And she cannot tell us yet.\"\"We must guard her carefully.\"\"I shall.\" Niall looked around the room. \"I think we should also leave a guardon this place, in case some of them should return.\"\"You think there may be more of them in the city?\"\"Not now, perhaps. But when their master knows he has failed, I think he willtry again.\" He was suddenly struck by a sense of the preposterousness of thesituation. \"But, in the name of the goddess, where are they coming from?\"\"Our patrols have been instructed to search the area for fifty miles around thecity. There are no reports of intruders.\"\"I wasn't thinking about intruders. Where is their city?\"\"There are no reports of large concentrations of human beings in the lands ruledby the Death Lord.\"Dravig's impassivity, and the oddly impersonal manner in which he deliveredinformation, produced in Niall a mixture of frustration and amusement. \"How fardo these lands extend?\"\"I cannot give you precise figures. My people lack an interest in such matters.I would advise you to speak to the commander of the aerial survey force.\"Niall was intrigued. The spiders never volunteered information about theirpolitical or military organization, so that even after six months of workingwith them, he knew little more than at the beginning.\"What is his name?\"\"Your people call him Asmak.\"\"Where can he be found?\"\"At the headquarters of the Death Lord. Shall I send for him?\"\"No. I'm going back now. There is no more to be learned here.\"Dravig made ritual obeisance. \"In that case I shall return to deliver myreport.\"Niall waited until he was sure Dravig was out of the building, then took fromthe drawer one of the stone figures, still wrapped in its cloth -- Dravig, heknew, would advise him against it. This he placed in the pocket of his tunic. Hethen replaced the clothing on top of the other figures, and closed the drawer.Finally, he took the flat wooden box containing the seaweed, wrapping it firstin one of the slave garments to prevent the water from dripping.The wolf spider was still standing on guard -- now, under observation from thecharioteers, as rigid as a statue; a few scattered feathers drifting in thegutter were all that remained of the seagull.Niall said: \"I would like you to keep guard inside the house with the doorclosed. I will send another guard to relieve you shortly.\" It was not clearwhether the spider understood; its two main eyes, and the four subsidiary eyesbeneath, stared rigidly and unwaveringly into space. But by the time the chariotturned the corner at the end of the street, it had vanished into the house, andthe front door was closed. As they crossed the main square, Niall ordered the charioteers to halt besidethe green lawn that surrounded the white tower. He then dismissed them, tellingthem to go and eat; his insight into their minds told him that they wereravenously hungry.As soon as he approached the tower, he knew there was something wrong. Itnormally exerted upon him a peculiar feeling of attraction, like the pull of amagnet. Now this familiar sensation was absent, as if his body had been encasedin some insulating substance. And in fact, when he reached out to touch thewall, there was no longer the sensation of plunging his hand into water; it wasmerely touching a solid surface.This baffled him. He walked round to the north side, where the vibrations wereusually stronger. It made no difference; the milky, almost translucent wallremained solid; it even looked solid, instead of appearing to shimmer, like somecrystallized smoke.Could it be the box he was carrying? He set this down on the marble platformthat surrounded the base of the tower; but even as he did so, he knew it made nodifference. Next he removed from his pocket the stone figurine. As soon as hisfingers touched it, he experienced a return of the sensation he had felt onfirst handling it, a mild vibration not unlike that of a living creature --perhaps one of the carnivorous plants of the Great Delta. And as soon as heplaced it on the ground, he felt a return of the familiar tingling sensationinduced by the force field of the tower. Even so, it seemed somehow duller, lesspowerful than usual. It was not until he placed the figurine on the grass thathe experienced again that curious sense of vibrancy, as if the atoms of his ownbody were somehow resonating at the same rate as those of the tower.He picked up the box, still wrapped in the damp slave garment; this made nodifference. Then he stepped forward into the curious electrical embrace of thewall, which was like water tingling with living energy. A moment later, hewalked out into the inner room of the tower, with its luminous curved walls.It was the first time in many months that this had happened. He normally foundhimself in some strange and often frightening landscape. On one occasion it hadbeen the yellow, sulfurous mists of Venus; on another, the boiling maelstrom ofwater at the foot of the Victoria Falls; once he had even found himself sharinga sunlit pond with other ani-malculae. But the Steegmaster, who had inauguratedthis guessing game, clearly felt that now was no time for distractions.Niall said aloud: \"What's happening?\"As he spoke the words, the old man was standing in front of him, exactly as ifhe had been there all the time. He offered only the briefest nod of greeting.\"The walls of the tower were designed to exclude potentially hostile entities.\"\"I do not understand.\"\"The creature you tried to bring into the tower was potentially destructive.\"\"But it wasn't a creature. It was a piece of stone.\"The old man stared at him from under the bushy eyebrows. \"Are you certain ofthat?\"\"Quite certain. It was a kind of odd little statuette.\"\"Where did it come from?\"\"A room in the slave quarter. It was the hideout of Skorbo's killers.\"The old man shook his head. \"I suspect you have been deceived. Describe thecircumstances in which you found it.\"Since this was precisely why he had come, Niall described the events of the pasthour in some detail. The old man listened without expression -- Niall suspectedthat it was part of his present policy to accustom Niall to the fact that he wasmerely a machine -- then said: \"I must see this artifact.\"To Niall's astonishment, he walked into the wall and vanished. Niall steppedafter him, and found himself standing in the sunlight -- it was always aslightly vertiginous sensation to walk through a solid wall and step intonothingness. The old man was already bending over the cloth-wrapped figurine onthe grass. A few passers-by in the square apparently took him for someone likethemselves, for no one paid any attention to him.Niall found it impossible to resist asking: \"Have you even been out herebefore?\"The old man shook his head. \"There has never been any occasion for it.\"He unwrapped the cloth from the figurine, and held it on the palm of his hand.Niall said: \"Well?\"\"I admit that I cannot understand why it has produced this anomalous reaction.It is clearly a piece of silicate mineral related to nephrite.\"He turned and once again vanished through the wall of the tower. Niall followedhim in. The old man was still studying the figurine -- Niall observed that itwas the one with closed eyelids -- in the palm of his hand. He shook his head.\"I must confess that this problem is beyond the capacity of my informationcircuits.\"Niall could not repress an ironic smile. \"You mean it contradicts Steeg'sconception of the universe?\"\"Precisely.\"\"Doesn't that suggest that your information circuits need to be extended?\"\"That inference seems reasonable.\" Niall reflected that the advantage of amachine is that it is not ashamed to admit that it might have been wrong.\"What do you propose to do?\"\"First of all to neutralize it.\"He placed it on the floor, then stepped back. What happened next made Nialljump. A beam of intense blue light stabbed down obliquely from above,illuminating the figurine. There was no obvious source of light; it appeared toemanate from the plain white surface of the ceiling. In its glow, the figurineappeared to be faintly luminous. The air around them became suddenly chilly.Niall asked: \"What's that?\"\"A cold beam.\"\"I thought they were green.\"\"They normally are. But this one induces a temperature of absolute zero,reducing all the molecules to immobility. If there is any vestige of life, itwill be placed in suspended animation.\"\"Wouldn't that destroy it?\"\"Not if the freezing process occurs rapidly enough. In the great ice ages, fishwere sometimes frozen instantaneously in rivers, and were able to swim away whenthe ice melted.\"The temperature had plunged swiftly; Niall's breath now turned to vapor as heexhaled. But as he shivered and pulled his cloak around his neck, the blue beamvanished, and the room seemed to become instantly warmer. Water vaporimmediately froze around the figurine, turning it white. Niall winced as the oldman bent and picked it up, aware that his own flesh would have been seared as ifby a white hot iron. After contemplating it steadily for several seconds --Niall was aware that he was performing some kind of analysis -- the old man onceagain stepped into the wall. A few moments later he reappeared, but this timewithout the figurine. In answer to Niall's look of interrogation he said: \"Thecold had neutralized its force. But caution suggests that it would be betterleft outside.\"\"Have you any idea of the nature of the force?\"\"None, except that it is biological.\"\"What makes you so sure?\"\"Because it was neutralized by the cold.\"\"But you admit that Steeg didn't understand it?\"\"I admit that he made no allowance for it in creating my information circuits.\"\"Doesn't that suggest that he may have been mistaken about the existence ofmagic?\"\"Magic signifies supernatural interference in natural processes. Steeg regardedthat as a primitive superstition.\"Niall said patiently: \"Look. A group of murderers came to this city carryingpendants inscribed with magical symbols of revenge. They also brought stonefigures that appear to be alive. Surely Steeg himself would have agreed thatthis was something beyond his understanding?\"\"Steeg knew that the universe is full of things beyond his comprehension. But hewould have denied that these things can contradict the basic laws of logic andreason.\"\"Perhaps they don't. Perhaps they simply obey a different kind of logic.\"\"What are you suggesting?\"\"Well, you have hundreds of books on magic, don't you? Some of them must containclues about what's going on. Couldn't you find out?\"\"You are asking me to make a comprehensive search of more than three thousandvolumes.\"\"Could it be done?\"\"Of course. But it would take a long time.\"Niall's heart sank. \"How long?\"\"Perhaps half an hour.\"Niall burst out laughing. \"That's all right. I can wait that long. I'll go tothe dining room. Would you give me a call when you're ready?\"The dining room was on the same floor as the \"Florentine\" gallery. It was asmall room, containing no more than a dozen tables, although since Niall hadbeen eating there regularly, these had been enlivened with attractive tablecloths, and the food was served on decorated china plates instead of plasticdishes. There was no fresh food available, but the food synthesizer was of sucha high standard that its products were greatly superior to the food cooked byNiall's own kitchen staff. Even after six months he was still astonished by itsvariety.The synthesizer was an oblong metal box, about three feet long, which wasattached to the wall beside the window. The menu that was displayed above itoffered a list of food and drink amounting to more than a hundred items,beginning with hamburgers (with or without onions) and ending with Burgundy,Bordeaux, and American Chardonnay. Over the past six months Niall had sampledeverything on it, from pâté de foie gras and tournedos Rossini to peach melbaand crêpes suzettes; he had finally concluded that his taste was toounsophisticated for most of these culinary marvels, and that he preferred atwo-course meal of fish and chips and pecan pie with pistachio ice cream. Thisis what he now proceeded to order from the synthesizer, unaware that in so doinghe was merely confirming the verdict of dozens of generations of teenagers. Healso ordered a glass of sparkling apple juice, whose taste he greatly preferredto that of wine.As he ate he looked out the open window at the bustling market scene, whichlooked exactly as it must have looked in the days of Lorenzo de'Medici. Niallhad come to recognize many of the stallholders and their typical cries, as wellas many of the servants and housewives who made regular visits to the market.The man who ran the butcher's stall on the corner had a hoarse shout that couldbe heard above all the other sounds of the city, including the bellowing ofcattle and the bleating of sheep. Like most of the males in the square, he tooka keen interest in the red-haired peasant woman who ran the vegetable stall thatwas directly opposite Niall's window. This woman, who was in her mid-thirties,was taller than the average man, and had a magnificent ringing laugh and ajaunty way of throwing back her head and placing her hands on her hips. She madeNiall think of a noisier and coarser Princess Merlew. Most of the men enjoyedlaughing and joking with her, and although Niall was unable to understand thelanguage, he guessed from the ribald laughter that many of the jokes must havebeen indecent.She was also the object of admiration of a wealthy young man who stopped at herstall at least once a day -- he wore a purple doublet, a hat that reminded Niallof an inverted flower bowl, and rode a chestnut mare. This young man wasregarded with dislike and derision by the male stallholders, particularly thebutcher; but Niall sensed that their hostility was based on envy, and on acertain fear that the redhead would one day surrender her virtue to the lovesickgallant. Niall entertained the same suspicion; one day toward evening, when mostof the stallholders had packed up and left, he had seen the young man presenther with a bouquet of flowers, and -- after glancing around to see that no onewas watching -- the woman had accepted them and hidden them under her stall. Butwhen he leaned forward and whispered something in her ear, she had shaken herhead vigorously. And the butcher, who had come out from behind his stall at thatmoment, had scowled angrily, and as the young man rode away, he spat on theground.Now, as Niall gazed out of the window, he witnessed an interesting scene betweenthe red-haired woman and a boatman who had moored his craft by the first flightof steps that ran up from the river to the market square. The boatman wascarrying a large fish -- it must have been more than a foot long -- and wasobviously trying to persuade her to buy it. She shook her head, as if objectingthat he was asking too much. He leaned forward and said something; she lookedthoughtful, then finally nodded her head and handed over money and a basket of agreen vegetable not unlike cabbage. The man went behind the stall and placed thefish in a box. Then, as he was turning away, he took the woman's arm and pulledher toward him. Niall could not see what happened next -- the man's body wasbetween them -- but the woman's reaction was to give him a box on the ear thatmade him stagger. The woman on the next stall began to laugh loudly -- she had amost unpleasant cackle -- and this seemed to enrage the man, who tried to takeback his fish. The woman grabbed the box and held it out of his reach. Within afew seconds there was a noisy quarrel involving at least half a dozen men andtwo women, as well as a half-starved mongrel, which barked furiously and triedto bite the fisherman's leg. The man quickly got the worst of it -- he hadclearly expected to be allowed certain liberties in exchange for selling thefish cheaply -- and he slunk off to his boat, leaving the basket of vegetablesbehind. And the stallholders, obviously sorry that the diversion was over, wentreluctantly back to work. The overexcited dog went on barking until a man gaveit a kick that lifted it off the ground; it vanished toward the river with apathetic yelp.Niall had been watching all this with such total absorption that he jumped inalarm when the old man's voice spoke in his ear. \"I am sorry I have taken solong. The task was more complicated than I expected.\"\"It doesn't matter. I've been watching that woman down there.\" He was struck bya sudden suspicion. \"Or did you arrange it all to keep me amused?\"\"No. Today is market day. If you had been here yesterday the square would havebeen empty.\" He pulled up a chair and sat down on the other side of the table.Since he was unreal, this pantomime was unnecessary; yet, as he had oftenexplained to Niall, the crowning achievement of the Steegmaster was theextraordinary detail of its realism.Niall spooned up his melted ice cream. \"Did those people down there reallyexist?\"The old man looked at him with mild reproof. \"Since the camera was not inventedin 1490, that is obviously an impossibility.\"Niall looked down at the red-haired woman, who was now showing off her fish tothe woman on the next stall.\"So if I was a magician, and I could travel back to 1490, these people wouldn'tbe there?\"The old man sighed. \"What you call time travel is a verbal misunderstanding.Time is merely another name for process. In theory, process can be reversed, butto restore the universe to its state of five minutes ago would take an infiniteamount of energy. Therefore, to travel into the past would be quite impossible.\"Niall asked: \"And is that also true of the future?\"\"Not quite. Anyone can predict the future. I can tell you the exact time the sunwill rise tomorrow. I can even tell you what the weather will be like. Yet I amnot a magician.\"Niall said: \"I dreamed of the future last night, and when I woke up, it happenedexactly as I dreamed it. Does that mean I am a magician?\"The old man shrugged. \"I am not programmed to answer that question.\" Then,oblivious to Niall's grimace of frustration, he went on: \"Do you wish to hearwhat I learned about the nature of magic?\"Niall sighed. \"Very well.\"\"I admit that I was mistaken to believe that it was merely an irrationalsuperstition.\" Niall looked up with renewed interest. \"It appears to be an oddlyconsistent system of belief, whose foundations cannot be clearly distinguishedfrom those of religion.\"Niall frowned; he always found abstract jargon difficult to absorb.\"I see.\"\"As far as I can see, it appears to be based upon a number of propositions. Thebest known of these is attributed to the legendary founder of magic, HermesTrismegistos, and it states: 'As above, so below.' This appears to mean thatevery man is a miniature version of the whole universe. \"Niall tried to look as if he understood.The old man went on: \"But according to magical philosophy, the universe does notconsist of dead matter -- in fact, there is no such thing as dead matter.Everything in the universe is alive.\"Niall said: \"Like that stone figure I tried to bring into the tower?\"\"Possibly.\" The tone was noncommittal. \"The magical view is that all matterexists outside space and time, in a multidimensional universe. We only see onesmall aspect of a being that reaches back through many invisible planes ofexistence. It follows, of course, that human beings also exist on many planes ofexistence, although they are not aware of it. According to the Cabalists, thereare ten planes of existence, the highest being God and the lowest earth. Inhuman beings, these planes of existence are planes of consciousness. Am I goingtoo fast for you?\"\"No.\" This last comment had aroused Niall's attention. \"So there are ten planesof consciousness?\"\"According to the Cabala.\"\"Are you saying that if you could get up to a higher plane, you'd be amagician?\"\"That appears to be the position.\"Niall shook his head and sighed. \"I don't follow that. If I can rise to a higherlevel of consciousness, surely the only person it affects is me? It's likegetting drunk. When I've had a few glasses of mead, everyone seems much nicer.But they haven't really changed -- it's just me.\"\"A perceptive comment. But according to magical philosophy, the best way tochange the world is to change your own consciousness. One alchemist wrote:'Magic is the art of causing changes in consciousness at will.' According to thesame writer, luck is an example of the use of magic. When you feel lucky, youusually are lucky. You somehow make lucky things happen to you. And people whofeel unlucky seem to make unlucky things happen to them. According to anotheralchemist, this is the real meaning of 'As above, so below.' Everyone knows thatthe mind can be affected by the external world -- that a dull day can make youfeel dull. But the magician is someone who knows that the mind can also affectthe external world. When you are full of courage and optimism, you somehow makegood things happen to you.\"Niall shook his head in wonderment. \"And that's magic?\"\"According to the books I have consulted.\"Niall said thoughtfully: \"This magician doesn't seem to have been very lucky.\"\"I beg your pardon?\"\"This man who sent Skorbo's killers. First two of his servants get carried offby Skorbo. And when they've killed Skorbo they all get caught. That doesn'tsound very lucky, does it?\"The old man's face remained inscrutable, an indication that he failed to graspwhat Niall was talking about. \"No doubt you are correct.\"Niall said thoughtfully: \"So it sounds as if it's my luck against his.\"This time the old man made no comment. After a long silence he said: \"Do youwish me to continue to summarize the nature of magic?\"Niall shook his head. \"Not now, thank you. But I'd like to ask your opinionabout that dream. Do you know about the girl we found hanging upside down inSkorbo's larder?\"\"Yes.\" The Steegmaster's ability to read thoughts meant that it was able toperceive every important event that occurred in the city.\"I dreamed about her last night. I dreamt that Simeon came and cut off her tunicwith a big pair of scissors, and I saw that she had bits of brown stuff, likedead leaves, stuck to her skin. Well, when I woke up, Simeon did cut off hertunic with a pair of scissors, and she did have bits of brown stuff stuck to herskin. How can you explain that?\"\"And were they dead leaves?\"\"No. They were this stuff.\" He bent down and picked up the flat box from underhis chair. \"Seaweed.\"The old man took a damp brown frond between his thumb and forefinger, and staredat it intently. Niall knew enough of the operations of the Steegmaster to knowthat it was being chemically analyzed.\"This is not seaweed.\"\"It's not?\" Niall was astonished. \"It smells like it.\"\"Sea water contains a precise percentage of magnesium, sulfur, and calcium, aswell as fifty-eight other elements. This contains far too much of all three, aswell as a high percentage of phosphorus. That indicates that it comes from afreshwater lake with a high mineral content. It could be the crater of anextinct volcano.\"\"Could it be an underground lake?\"\"Impossible. Even weed requires light to grow. As you can see, this weed was notoriginally brown but green.\" He placed his finger on a small area of weed thatwas, in fact, a pale green. \"It has oxidized to this brown color.\"Niall stared at the brown mat of weed, whose smell filled the room.\"And that means sunlight?\"\"Of course. Plants live by photosynthesis -- absorbing carbon dioxide to producesugar.\"\"Have you any idea where it might have come from?\"\"I cannot be specific. There are a dozen extinct volcanoes within fifty miles.\"Niall recalled from his sleep-learning sessions that the approach of the cometOpik had produced many volcanic eruptions.\"And are there many lakes with that kind of high mineral content?\"\"Certainly not in this region.\"\"Could it be identified?\"\"Unfortunately, I know of no such lake. But you must remember that most of mygeological information dates back several centuries.\"Niall lifted the mat of weed, and held it up by its corners. \"Why do you supposethe magician's servants brought this with them?\"A silence of ten seconds indicated that the Steegmaster was surveying manyalternatives. \"Possibly it has some religious significance.\"\"Religious?\" This idea bewildered him.\"Or it may have been used in some kind of magical ritual.\"\"What kind of ritual?\"\"That is impossible to say. There was a tribe of Indians in Ecuador who wore agarment made of leaves from a sacred tree for their magical ceremonies. Youobserve that this mat is a human artifact.\"This also came as a surprise. Niall spread out the weed on the tabletop. Nowthat he examined it closely, he could see that the old man was correct. A numberof pieces of weed had been woven together so skillfully that it was virtuallyimpossible to see the joins. He held it out at arm's length. Yet it wasobviously a mat, not some kind of a garment. He sighed with exasperation as herefolded it and replaced it in the box.\"They must have had some reason for bringing it. But what could it have been?\"\"I can offer no other suggestions.\"Niall looked out the window at the sunlit market scene, which was now busierthan ever. \"And if time travel is impossible, how did I dream of the future. Canyour books on magic explain that?\"\"Magical philosophy states that the mind exists outside space and time. Only thebody is subject to these limitations. So when the body is asleep, the mind maybe able to pass beyond space and time.\"Niall asked with excitement: \"Do you think that's true?\"The old man smiled gently. \"How could I?\" Niall shrugged impatiently. \"I have nomeans of judging whether such a theory is true or not. I exist merely in spaceand time. You are alive, which means that you are not entirely limited by spaceand time. You must judge for yourself.\"Niall felt a twinge of remorse. \"I'm sorry.\" He stood up. \"And thank you foryour help.\" Apologizing made him feel calmer, less frustrated.\"It is always available.\" His courtesy made Niall feel even more ashamed of hisimpatience.The position of the sun in the sky showed that it was about two hours aftermidday. As he moved from behind the table, Niall became aware of the box in hispocket. He had totally forgotten about it. \"Have you any idea what this is?\"The old man took the pointed quill and held it in the palm of his hand.\"Yes. This is a primitive form of hypodermic syringe, of the kind invented inthe seventeenth century.\" He uncorked the bottle and sniffed its contents. Aftera pause he said: \"And this is human blood serum containing traces of spidervenom.\"Niall snapped his fingers. \"Of course! I should have guessed! A serum againstthe poison of the death spiders. Do you think it will work?\"The old man shook his head. \"There is only one way to find out -- byexperiment.\"\"Thank you.\" Niall was already halfway to the door when the old man stopped him.\"You have forgotten your lakeweed. Where are you going in such a hurry?\"\"To the hospital. It's full of people who've been paralyzed by spider venom.\"\"In that case, they will still be there when you arrive, will they not? Rememberthat impatience is the worst of human failings.\" But Niall was already out ofthe room. As he approached the hospital, Niall saw that the main doorway was blocked by asmall crowd. The hall beyond was also full of people, and a babe in arms wascrying lustily. Niall made his way round to the rear entrance, and was relievedto find it deserted. The first person he saw when he stepped inside was Phelim.\"What's happening?\"\"Word got around and they've all come looking for relatives.\"At the far end of the corridor, three nurses were forming a human barrier tohold back the crowd, and a powerfully built woman, whom Niall recognized as thematron, was admonishing everyone to make less noise. The door of the room inwhich the unconscious bodies were laid out stood open. As they approached, awoman rushed out, her hands over her face, wailing noisily. Behind her, Simeonwas shaking his head with angry disgust.\"Damn fool! She wants to take her husband back home. I told her he'd be betterhere.\" He noticed Niall, and made an obvious effort to regain his equanimity.\"Hello, my boy. You can see what chaos we're in.\"Half a dozen people were wandering around among the prostrate bodies, peeringanxiously into unconscious faces. One of them, a dark-haired girl in a simpleyellow dress, seemed vaguely familiar.Boyd came into the room, carrying an oblong metal container, with a large andbadly worn book balanced on top of it. He was obviously pleased with himself.\"Look what I've found.\"Phelim said resignedly: \"Go on. What is it?\"\"An ECT apparatus.\"Simeon said: \"A what?\"\"Electro-convulsive therapy. Look, here's a piece about it.\" He opened the bookand handed it to Simeon, who fumbled in his pocket and took out a pair ofgold-rimmed spectacles, which he balanced on his nose.Boyd watched his face anxiously as he read. \"Worth trying, don't you think?\"Simeon said nothing for several seconds, then shook his head. \"No. It's forcuring depressives. And it recommends administering a light general anestheticbefore use. These poor devils are already anesthetized.\"\"But it might wake them up.\"\"Too risky.\" The experiment with the snake serum had obviously made himcautious. \"Thanks anyway.\"Boyd shrugged disconsolately. As he left the room Simeon called after him: \"Keeptrying.\"Niall said: \"I think I may have the answer.\"\"To what?\"\"Waking them up.\" He produced the box from his pocket, and slid back the lid.\"What on earth's that?\"\"I found it in the hideout.\"Simeon stared at it through his spectacles, then held the brown bottle up to thelight. \"What do you suppose it is?\"\"I think it's antidote to spider venom.\"Simeon's face brightened. He took up the quill and squeezed the bulb. \"You couldbe right. This is obviously a crude hypodermic needle.\" Two spots of red on hischeekbones were the only indication of his excitement. He turned to Phelim.\"What do you think? Should we risk it?\"Phelim said cautiously: \"That's your decision. I'm only the assistant.\"Niall understood his doubts. If the \"antidote\" killed the patient, it would behard to know what to tell the relatives.Simeon turned to Niall. \"What do you think?\"\"I think it's probably safe. The Steegmaster said it contained only small tracesof spider venom.\"A girl's voice said: \"Please try it on my brother.\"It was the dark-haired girl in the yellow dress; she had come up behind them asthey were speaking. She was now the last of the visitors left in the room.\"What is your name?\"\"Quinella. I am from Dira.\"\"Ah yes. Where is your brother?\"\"Here.\" She led them across the room. \"You know him. His name is Eirek.\"\"Eirek! Of course!\" Eirek had been one of the crowd of children with whom Niallhad played in Kazak's underground city. But now, as he looked down at the thin,pale face, he was scarcely able to recognize him.Niall's eyes met Simeon's. He asked the girl: \"Do you understand the risk? Thisserum is untried. It could do him harm.\"Simeon added: \"It could even kill him.\"She said: \"But I feel he will die if he remains like this.\"Niall understood her fear. Many of the children of Dira had died on their marchacross the desert; even now, Eirek's ribs showed clearly through his skin.Simeon shrugged. \"Very well.\" He turned to Phelim. \"Hand me a new syringe.\" Hedipped the needle into the brown bottle, and drew up some of the pale yellowfluid into it. Then he carefully selected a spot on the underside of Eirek'sforearm, slapping the flesh to make the vein stand out. Then he drove home thepoint and pressed the plunger. After only a moment he withdrew the needle.\"I don't want to risk using too much.\"The girl smiled palely. \"Thank you.\" Her eyes had not left her brother's face.Simeon said gently: \"It could take hours, or even longer. Why don't you go home?We'll look after him.\"She shook her head. \"Please let me stay.\"He sighed. \"All right. You'd better find yourself a chair.\"Phelim muttered: \"Here's more of them.\"There was a sound of voices in the corridor. The matron appeared in the doorway.\"Can I let some more in?\" Simeon nodded, and half a dozen subdued-looking menand women shuffled into the room. A moment later, as Simeon was taking Eirek'spulse, they were all startled by a loud shriek; it came from a middle-aged womanwith dyed golden hair.\"My husband! My dear husband!\" She flung herself down on one of the bodies andbegan to kiss the face. The trestle table on which it was lying almostcollapsed. Simeon said sternly: \"Madam, unless you control yourself, you mustleave immediately.\"She appeared not to hear him. \"Is he alive?\"\"Yes. But please lower your voice.\"The woman began patting the man's cheeks with both hands -- the pats were sohard they amounted to slaps. \"Noldi! Wake up! It's me.\"Simeon glanced at the matron, who took the woman firmly by the arm. Sheimmediately burst into loud cries and shook herself free.Niall had seen the problem before: in the spider city, there were manymiddle-aged women who had become domineering and prone to uncontrolled outburstsof emotion. In the days of slavery, men and women had been kept segregated. Themen, under the direct domination of the spiders, were little more thanworkhorses. Women, on the other hand, had little direct contact with thespiders; they were under the supervision of female commanders, and weregenerally well treated. Compared with men, they saw themselves as a kind ofaristocracy. Older ones -- like this woman -- were usually promoted to matronsin charge of women's hostels, and became accustomed to authority. But without ahusband and children, they often became self-centered, and prone to violentoutbursts of emotion, like the one they were now witnessing.Eventually the woman was persuaded to sit down, and a nurse was dispatched tofetch her a cup of herb tea. Meanwhile, the other visitors had finished theirsurvey of the paralyzed victims. Most of them were obviously disappointed. Onlyone sad-looking woman continued to stand by the body of a child, tears runningdown her cheeks. Niall asked: \"Do you know her?\"\"She is my daughter. But I think she is dead.\"The girl was a slight, thin child, about twelve years old; fragments of cobwebwere sticking to her blonde hair.\"No. She is still alive.\"He confirmed this by probing her mind. To his surprise, the child seemed to befully conscious. For a moment he suspected her of shamming, then realized that,although aware of all the sounds from the surrounding room, she was unable tomove a muscle.The girl in the yellow dress gave a sudden cry. \"He's waking up!\"In fact, Eirek's eyelids were fluttering in a manner that suggested a nervoustwitch rather than someone waking from sleep. A moment later they closed again.Then the rib cage expanded in a deep breath, and he shook his head violently, asif someone had slapped his face. A moment later his eyes opened and he staredaround with a startled expression.The girl said: \"Eirek. Do you know me?\"He smiled faintly and nodded. \"Quinny.\"Simeon said: \"That's remarkable. It took less than five minutes. No, please. ..\" These last words were addressed to Quinella, who had seized his hand and waspressing it to her lips. Simeon pointed to Niall. \"He's the one you should thank-- he brought the antidote.\"There was a loud cry from the middle-aged woman, who had joined the group roundthe table. Now she flung herself at Simeon's feet. \"Please give it to myhusband! I beg you in the name of the great goddess. . .\"Simeon blushed with embarrassment as the woman tried to embrace his legs.\"Please get up, madam. I'll do my best for everyone.\"\"Promise me first. Promise me you'll give him some.\"Simeon took a deep breath; for a moment Niall thought he was going to lose histemper. Then he said: \"Very well, madam. But please get up and promise to behaveyourself.\"\"I swear!\" A calculating expression came into her eyes. \"But you'll give it tohim now, won't you?\"\"Very well.\"The woman's husband was a handsome, powerfully built man, obviously at least tenyears her junior. Because the spiders had always paid so much attention to thephysical well-being of their human subjects -- breeding them like prize cattle-- this city was full of magnificently handsome men with the physique of Greekgods and women with superb figures. For Niall, it was a perpetuallydisillusioning experience to glimpse their minds and realize that they wereutterly without the power of reflection.Simeon drove the needle into the man's forearm, withdrawing it almostimmediately. The woman asked: \"Are you sure that's enough?\"Simeon said gruffly: \"This is all we have, and it has to serve for a dozenpeople.\"Niall's eyes encountered those of the mother of the twelve-year-old girl; hecould see that she was too shy or too timid to speak. He placed his hand onSimeon's arm. \"Give some to the little girl. It shouldn't take much.\" The mothergave him a warm smile of gratitude.Simeon slapped the child's thin forearm to bring up the vein, then drove in theneedle. As he did so, Niall once again probed her mind, and again was puzzled torealize that she was as wide awake as he was. The likeliest explanation, heconcluded, was that because she was so small, the spider had injected acarefully graduated dose of venom, precisely enough to paralyze the nervoussystem without killing her. This was confirmed when, a few seconds later, thegirl's eyelids fluttered and she opened her eyes. She smiled at her mother, thenimmediately turned to look at Niall, although he had been standing beyond herline of vision.Niall reached out and took her hand. \"What is your name?\"\"Wenda.\"\"How long have you been awake?\"\"All the time.\"Simeon was obviously baffled by her reply. \"What does she mean?\"Niall asked her: \"Ever since the spider jumped on you?\" She nodded.Simeon said: \"Great goddess!\"Niall was puzzled by her composure. \"Wasn't it horrible?\"She shook her head. \"No, it was a kind of. . . sleepy feeling.\"Niall began to understand. His grandfather had once described how he had beenseized by a death spider, and how, instead of feeling terrified, he hadexperienced a curious dreamy sensation, as if he was in no danger. Now it seemedplain that, as they pounced, the spiders somehow anesthetized the mind againstfear. On reflection, this seemed logical. A victim in the grip of terror woulddie sooner than a victim who experienced an illusory sense of security.The middle-aged woman grabbed Simeon's arm. \"Look! He's waking up.\"Her husband was shaking his head and staring around him in a bewildered manner.\"How long have I been asleep?\"It was obvious that he had no idea of what had happened to him.The matron appeared in the doorway. \"Is it all right to let some more of themin?\"Simeon snapped impatiently: \"No it isn't. Keep them out for at least half anhour.\" He was taking the man's pulse. \"Do you feel strong enough to walk?\"\"Of course.\" He jumped off the table.\"Good. Take him home, madam.\"The woman seized her husband by the arm, and hurried him out without pausing tosay thank you.The child was now in her mother's arms. Niall asked the woman: \"When did shedisappear?\"\"Exactly six weeks and two days ago.\"Niall asked the child: \"And you were awake all that time?\" She nodded. \"And youweren't afraid?\" She shook her head firmly.Simeon muttered: \"Incredible!\"The child said: \"But I didn't like the nasty man.\"\"What nasty man?\"\"The man with the funny lips.\"Niall and Simeon exchanged glances; the phrase evoked Skorbo's assassins, withtheir strangely sensual lips. Niall took the child's hand, gazed into her eyesand probed her mind. What he saw there startled him. He asked her: \"You saw thisman with the spiders?\" She nodded. \"And they didn't attack him?\"\"No. They were friends.\"Niall could see that further questioning would be pointless; she had told himall she knew, and her mind was succumbing to exhaustion; when he tried to probefurther, it was as if he was trying to see through a drifting fog. \"You'd bettertake her home. Do you live nearby?\"\"Across the street.\"Simeon said: \"Make sure she gets a good sleep. Bring her in to see me tomorrow.\"When the mother had gone Simeon asked: \"Did that child mean what I thought shemeant?\"Niall nodded. \"I'm afraid she did.\"Phelim was looking baffled: \"What did she mean?\"Simeon said: \"The man with the funny lips was one of the killers.\"\"But she said they were friends.\" He looked from Niall to Simeon. \"Perhaps shewas dreaming? Or suffering from delirium?\"Niall shook his head. \"I'm certain she wasn't.\"\"But that's absurd. Why should Skorbo be friendly with one of his killers?\"Niall said: \"It could mean one of two things. Either that this man betrayed hiscomrades to Skorbo. . .\"Simeon finished the sentence: \"Or Skorbo was in league with the magician.\"\"Oh, surely not -- that doesn't make sense. If Skorbo was in league with themwhy did he drag two of them off to his larder? And why did they kill him?\"Niall shook his head. \"Perhaps they betrayed him. Perhaps he betrayed them. Idon't know. But I'm certain she wasn't dreaming.\"There was a silence, while each of them was lost in his own thoughts. FinallySimeon shrugged.\"I agree. It doesn't make sense. But we have work to do.\" He asked Phelim: \"Howmuch serum is there left?\"Phelim held up the bottle against the light. \"About an inch.\"\"Then we might have enough.\"For the next ten minutes he moved deliberately among the prostrate bodies,injecting each with a carefully measured quantity of the serum. A few woke upalmost immediately; others took several minutes before they showed signs ofreturning consciousness. Some of these began to moan, as if in the grip of anightmare. But most gave the characteristic shake of the head, and gazed aroundthem in perplexity.Simeon grunted with satisfaction. \"Amazing stuff.\"Phelim asked: \"Why does it work so quickly?\"\"I imagine it's because the spiders inject a precise amount of poison toparalyze the nervous system but not to kill. As soon as the balance is altered,the victim begins to recover.\"The last to be injected was the girl who had reacted so badly to the snakeserum. Niall watched her with anxiety, and was relieved when her eyelids openedalmost immediately. As her eyes met Niall's, her face broke into a warm andgentle smile, which was succeeded a moment later by a look of alarm andembarrassment. What had happened, he realized, was that she had recognized himfrom the depth of her dream consciousness as someone with whom she hadexperienced some form of intimacy; a moment later, she recognized him, and wasplunged into confusion.He took her hand and helped her into a sitting position. \"What is your name?\"\"Amaryllis.\"\"Did you see the spider that attacked you?\"She shook her head. \"I remember nothing.\"\"Where were you when you were attacked?\"\"In the slave quarter.\"Niall and Simeon exchanged glances.\"Please tell me all you can remember.\" When she still hesitated, he asked: \"Whatwere you doing in the slave quarter?\"\"I had been to see my old nurse.\" In the days of slavery, all children had beenreared in nurseries, with female slaves as wet nurses. The result was thatchildren often regarded the nurse as their true mother.\"Then what happened?\"\"It was a full moon, and we walked down to the new lake while Dinah's sister wascooking supper. Then we started to walk back. . .\"\"Can you remember which way you walked?\"\"Along the river bank. But we turned into a side street.\"\"Which one?\"\"I cannot recall. We were talking. . .\"\"And what happened?\"\"Dinah screamed, and something knocked me down. . .\" \"Did you see or feelanything?\"\"It all happened so quickly.\" She began to cry. \"What happened to Dinah?\"Simeon patted her hand. \"We'll try to find her, don't worry.\"While they had been speaking, the room had gradually emptied as patients wereled away to be reunited with relatives. Some were so weak that they had to besupported by nurses; many seemed dazed and distressed. Now, at a signal fromSimeon, Amaryllis was also led away by the matron. Niall watched her go withregret. Because he had infused some of his vitality into her, he felt that shewas taking a part of his identity with her. It was a sad, yet at the same timean oddly pleasant sensation.Simeon said: \"It's strange that she was in the slave quarter. Do you think. . .?\"\"I'm afraid so. The hideout was within fifty yards of the new lake. She may havebeen attacked in the same street.\"Simeon ran his fingers through his stubbly gray hair. \"This is insane. Whyshould Skorbo be in league with them? What would be the advantage to eitherside?\"Niall shook his head. \"I don't know.\"Phelim said: \"What I can't understand is how Skorbo could keep such a secret.Surely the other spiders would be able to read his mind?\"Niall saw he was suffering from a familiar misconception about telepathy. \"Notnecessarily. It's not difficult to hide your thoughts, particularly if no onehas any reason to suspect you. Skorbo was the captain of the guard, so none ofhis subordinates would dare to probe his mind. And his superiors -- the SpiderLord and his council -- wouldn't want to read his mind.\"\"Why not?\"It was not easy to explain. \"Skorbo was a commoner, an ordinary soldier of noparticular distinction. They simply wouldn't be interested in what went on inhis mind. They'd find it slightly distasteful.\"Simeon had noticed the box wrapped in the slave tunic; Niall had left it on achair.\"What's this?\"\"I found it in the hideout. It's a sort of seaweed. You remember the brownfragments on that girl's body. . .\"He broke off, and he and Simeon stared at one another with sudden dismay; thesame thought had struck them both at the same time. Simeon smote his forehead.\"We've used up all the serum!\"\"Are you sure? There was some in the bottle. . .\"But the bottle and the hypodermic syringe both proved to be empty. Simeongroaned: \"What an idiot I am!\"Niall turned the bottle upside down; there was not even a drop left.Phelim said: \"Couldn't we make more?\"Simeon sighed. \"It looks as if we'll have to.\"Niall asked: \"How is it made?\"\"Oh, that's straightforward enough. First of all you have to get hold of somespider venom. Then you dilute it and inject someone with tiny quantities untilthey've formed a resistance. When that happens, the blood serum becomes anantidote to spider venom.\"Phelim asked: \"Don't we have any in the dispensary?\"\"No, for a simple reason. It's never been possible to get hold of spider venom.They obviously don't want anyone to develop an antidote.\"Niall said: \"I'm sure Dravig could arrange it. How long does it take to makeserum?\"\"Two weeks. Perhaps three.\"Phelim said: \"Does it really matter how long the girl remains unconscious?\"It was Simeon who answered. \"While she is unconscious she cannot be questioned.And she is now our only link with the magician.\" He shook his head. \"How thedevil did we both manage to forget the girl?\"The question was rhetorical; but as their eyes met, both realized they werethinking the same thing.A moment later, Boyd came into the room. He looked startled to see that thetables were now empty. \"Hello! Where's everyone gone?\"Phelim said: \"We found the antidote to the poison.\"\"Pity. I've got another idea.\"Simeon said quickly: \"What is it?\"\"But it's no use now, is it?\"Phelim said: \"Tell us all the same.\"\"One of these.\" Boyd reached up, and tugged from around his head something thatNiall had taken for a metal hairband. It was of a pale gold color.Niall asked: \"What is it?\"\"It's called a Gullstrand apparatus. It's supposed to help brain-damagedpatients.\"Niall took it from him. It looked so much like a hairband that he wonderedwhether Boyd was mistaken.\"It doesn't seem to have any controls.\"\"It doesn't need any. It's made of two substances, a conductor and anonconductor, and when the ends make contact with the skin, it fires randombursts of electric current into the brain. Why don't you try it?\"Niall slipped it on to his head, with the center of the band across his foreheadand the ends above his ears. He expected to feel some kind of electricaltingling sensation; in fact, he felt nothing. \"Are you sure it works?\"\"It takes a minute or two.\"\"Then what happens?\"\"I got strange sorts of flashes, then some rather weird sensations.\" Somethingin Boyd's expression suggested that he was saying rather less than he meant.They stood there, watching him in silence. Niall finally shook his head.\"Nothing's happening. Are you sure it's switched on?\"\"It's on all the time. It works off permanent batteries.\"\"Perhaps they're worn out.\"\"Not likely.\" Boyd spoke with confidence. \"They only use a few millivolts.They'll last forever.\"Niall slipped it off his head and held it out to Simeon. \"I don't think it'sgoing to work.\"Simeon said: \"Keep it. It's yours.\"\"Mine?\"\"It was found in this city. You are the ruler of this city. Therefore,everything in it belongs to you.\"\"Thank you.\" Niall replaced it on his head, this time using it as a circlet tohold the hair in place.Boyd said: \"It worked for me. There must be something peculiar about your brain.\" Niall opened his eyes and stared around him in bewilderment. It took him a fewmoments to recognize where he was. He was lying in the empty hallway of thehospital, at the foot of the stairs. Outside, the avenue was almost deserted. Afew yards away, down the corridor, he could hear the voice of the matron holdinga conversation with one of the nurses. The last thing he remembered was a flashof light inside his head, followed by a sharp pain like an incipient headache.He clambered hastily to his feet, glad that no one had noticed him lying there-- the thought of fainting filled him with embarrassment. The circlet was lyingon the floor; he picked it up and replaced it on his head. The moment he did so,he realized that this was what had been responsible for his loss ofconsciousness. His brain lurched, as if he had stepped onto the deck of a shiptossing in a storm, and he had to steady himself by grabbing the banister at thebottom of the stairway. He hastily snatched the circlet from his head, anddropped it into the wide pocket of his tunic. The moment he did so, the feelingof dizziness vanished, but a feeling of weakness remained.He sat down on the bottom step and closed his eyes. It was best to relax andallow himself to become totally passive; any attempt to think brought a returnof the weariness. But after a few minutes, his sensations returned to normal.When he stood up, he was relieved to find that there was no return of thenausea.But as soon as he stepped out into the winter sunlight he noticed thedifference. It was as distinct as waking up from sleep. Everything around himseemed oddly clear, as if some kind of a veil had been withdrawn. The outline ofeverything he looked at was oddly sharp and bright. There was a similarheightening in his physical sensations. The wind against his face seemed somehowcooler and stronger, as if he had just stepped out of a hot bath. The sensationof his clothing against his body, normally unnoticed, was now almost painfullyintrusive, as if a layer of skin had been removed. This new sense of clarity wasat once delightful and uncomfortable; even the sunlight seemed too bright, sothat he was forced to half-close his eyelids against it. In this state ofwide-awakeness, his normal consciousness seemed like a form of sleep.One thing was clear: that the Gullstrand apparatus caused peculiar changes inthe brain. Boyd had said that it was used to help braindamaged patients. He wastempted to return to the hospital, to see if the medical textbook contained anyfurther information; but since his forehead was covered in perspiration, and hefelt a strong desire to lie down, he decided against it.Now, as he walked along the southern side of the square toward the palace, herealized that strange things were still happening inside his head. He was nowexperiencing a disturbingly strange sensation -- as if everything had suddenlybeen magnified and then shrunk back to normal size. It felt rather as if someenormous object was rushing toward him at great speed, then receding again, oras if his brain was on a swing, swooping backwards and forwards. It was avertiginous experience, and brought back some of the earlier feeling of nausea.But he comforted himself with the thought that, since it had been caused by theGullstrand apparatus, which was now in his pocket, the effect should be onlytemporary.Staring at the pavement helped. But this had the curious effect of making thepavement seem closer and somehow more real; although he had been staring at itfor only a few seconds, he felt that he would remember it for the rest of hislife. He made a kind of effort -- like pushing it to arm's length -- and thisoverpowering sense of reality disappeared, to be replaced by a curious sensationas if he was seeing the pavement through the long end of a telescope.He had almost reached the palace when he heard the sound of footsteps runningbehind him. It was Boyd.\"You forgot this.\" He held out the box containing the lakeweed.\"Oh, thank you.\"Boyd looked at him closely. \"Are you all right? You look a bit funny.\"\"Yes. I'm all right. Just rather tired.\"Boyd looked down at the gold circlet, which was sticking out of the wide tunicpocket. \"It was that thing, wasn't it? It made me feel as if I'd had too manyglasses of mead. But it soon wears off.\"\"Do you know how it works?\"\"Yes, I think so. But it would take a long time to explain.\"\"Then why don't you come in? Or are they expecting you back?\"\"Oh no. They're trying to analyze the blood on that hatchet. That'll takehours.\" He looked up at the palace. \"Is this where you live?\"\"Yes.\"\"What a marvelous place. Does it have marble staircases?\"\"Yes. Would you like to come and see it?\"Boyd said eagerly: \"I'll say!\" The piece of slang was new to Niall, but hegathered that it signified assent.As they approached the door, Boyd glanced nervously at the wolf spider who stoodon guard; the spider betrayed no sign of being aware of their presence. When thedoor had closed behind them, Boyd asked in an undertone: \"Is that thing real?\"\"Of course.\" Niall looked at him in surprise.\"I thought it might be a statue. Doesn't it give you the creeps?\"Niall was surprised to find himself feeling defensive about the spiders. \"Humanbeings give spiders the creeps. We have to learn to get used to one another.\"Oblivious to the implied rebuke, Boyd was staring around the hallway. \"I say,what a place to live! It's like our town hall.\" He ran over to the fireplace andpeered up the chimney. \"Isn't it huge? Why doesn't the rain come down?\"\"I don't know.\"Boyd opened the cellar door. \"What's this place?\"\"The cellar.\"\"Can I have a look?\"\"It's dark down there.\"\"There's a lamp here.\" In a niche at the top of the stairs, there was anunlighted oil lamp, with a tinder box beside it. (Matches had been availablesince the end of slavery, but were still in short supply.) With an expertiseborn of long experience Boyd kindled the wick and replaced the chimney. Then,with Niall behind him, he went down into the cellar. Half a dozen smoked hamswere hanging from the beams, and there were a few barrels of pickles, preserves,and boxes of spices. Boyd said with disappointment: \"Not much here.\"\"No. It was cleaned out six months ago.\"\"What's in them?\" Boyd pointed to the massive black jars that stood against thefar wall.\"Nothing -- they're empty.\" As he spoke, Niall's heart contracted withforeboding. The jar in which he had placed the two pendants was broken, so thatone fragment was lying on the floor, together with the stone plug that hadsealed the neck. Boyd caught the gold-colored glint in the lamplight.\"Look, there's something in this one.\" He started to bend forward.Niall said sharply: \"Don't touch!\"Boyd straightened up obediently. Niall took the lamp from him, and knelt on oneknee. The jar had been cracked into three pieces, as if struck with asledgehammer. Two pieces remained upright; the third had fallen down.His first thought was that the jar had been accidentally broken by a servant --perhaps someone had removed the stone plug, found it unexpectedly heavy, anddropped it back into the neck, splitting the jar. Then he realized that this wasimprobable. No one knew that he had put the pendants into the jar, so no one hadany reason to look into it.Niall studied the pendants, holding the lamp close to them, then reached outcautiously and touched them. They were completely inert. He picked them up andheld them at arm's length.Boyd said: \"There was one of those back in the hospital. What are they?\"\"They are worn by the servants of the magician. Do you know about the magician?\"Boyd nodded. \"Uncle Simeon's been telling us.\"\"Then you know they can be dangerous.\"As he was speaking, Niall was trying to untangle the chains of the pendants; itwas impossible; they had been virtually knotted together. Yet he could clearlyremember dropping them from the glass into the jar, and noticing that they wereseparate. It should have been impossible for them to become entangled. Hefinally gave a hard tug that snapped one of the chains, and was able to pullthem apart. Boyd asked: \"Why are you doing that?\"\"Because when they are separated they have less power.\"If he had been alone, Niall would have taken the pendants to the white tower.Instead, he dropped them separately into two stone jars, deliberately choosingthe two that were furthest apart, and carefully resealing them with the stoneplugs.As they were returning up the stairs, Boyd asked: \"But who broke the jar?\"\"The magician.\"Boyd gazed at him with astonishment. \"He's been here?\"\"No. But the pendants are here, and that is enough. That is why they are sodangerous.\"Boyd was full of questions, but Niall answered them in a state of abstraction.He was still wondering about the broken jar, and about the effect of the twopendants. It probably meant that the magician was aware of everything that hadhappened in the palace in the past two days. Niall cursed himself for hiscarelessness, and vowed to take them to the white tower at the firstopportunity.His room was empty; Jarita, like many other women in the palace, was inclined totake a siesta in the afternoon. He laid the box containing the lakeweed on thetable, and removed the metal circlet from his pocket and placed it beside it.Now he became aware of the pressure of some object against his thigh; it was thegreen figurine. Before Boyd could ask what it was, Niall said: \"Tell me aboutthe Gullstrand apparatus.\"\"Shall I go and fetch the textbook?\"\"No. just tell me what you can remember.\"Boyd wrinkled his brow. \"Well, let's see. . . It's something about nervepathways in the brain. They carry different impulses. . .\" He stopped, drew adeep breath, and began again. \"They discovered that if someone has damage tosome particular area of the brain -- let's say he falls out of a tree and can'tuse his left hand -- he'd often recover without any help -- especially if hekept trying to use the hand. And that wasn't because the damaged area in thebrain had healed up. It was because he'd developed new nerve pathways around thedamaged area. I think that's correct, anyway.\"Niall nodded. \"It sounds right.\"\"So this man Gullstrand thought they must be discovering the new pathways bytrial and error. So he invented this thing to make it easier. It keeps onstimulating different nerve pathways at random. It's a bit like sending a lot ofpeople off down dark lanes, carrying torches. Sooner or later, one finds a way.\"Niall nodded slowly. He was beginning to understand some of the strangesensations he had experienced when he left the hospital. New nerve pathwayswould explain the sensation of freshness and newness, as if seeing things forthe first time. Yet he still failed to understand that other sensation: as ifhis brain was on a swing, swooping backwards and forwards, so that objectsseemed to come closer, then recede. Even thinking about it seemed to revive it,bringing a momentary feeling of dizziness.He asked Boyd: \"Can you describe how you felt when you tried it?\"\"There was a strange sort of flash -- as if somebody had hit me on the head.Then I felt sick. Then I began to get a strange sort of feeling as thougheverything was alive. . .\"\"Alive?\"\"That's right. And as if I was being watched. It began to get better after that-- a sort of excited feeling.\"Niall picked up the circlet. \"I'm going to try it on this girl. . .\"\"Can I come?\"\"Of course.\"In the corridor he almost bumped into Dona, who was carrying an armful ofchildren's clothes. When she saw Niall, she flushed with pleasure. \"Hello. Ihaven't seen you for a long time.\"\"No. I've been very busy.\" Her smile made him feel guilty. There was a time whenhe had intended to marry Dona. And although nothing had ever been said, he knewthat she was aware of it. The duties of kingship had made him push the idea tothe back of his mind. Yet he still experienced the same curious feeling ofgladness every time he saw her, a glow of affection that made him want to takeher in his arms.Boyd was staring at her with obvious curiosity. Niall hastened to introducethem. \"This is Boyd, Simeon's nephew. This is my cousin Dona.\"They exchanged smiles, and Boyd made the odd little half-bow that was thestandard formal greeting between males in the city of the bombardier beetles.There was a moment of embarrassed silence, then Dona looked down at the circletin Niall's hand. \"What's that?\"\"Oh, it's a. . .\" Niall would have preferred to leave it unexplained, but Boydbroke in eagerly: \"It's called a Gullstrand apparatus, and we're going to try iton this girl who's been bitten by a spider.\"\"Which girl?\" It was obvious that Dona knew nothing about it.Niall said: \"Come and see.\" He spoke reluctantly, feeling that Boyd had obligedhim to issue the invitation. For some reason, he experienced deep innerresistance to allowing his womenfolk to see the unconscious girl.But Dona immediately placed her pile of washing on the floor outside the door.\"Yes, I'd like to.\"The girl was lying there, exactly as Niall had left her that morning, with theblanket drawn up to her chin. The tangled bundle of web that Simeon had cut fromher body still lay on the floor. Her breathing was scarcely perceptible. Theface with its closed eyes looked as peaceful as a sleeping child.Dona said: \"She's beautiful.\"For some odd reason, Niall felt embarrassed by the remark. Without further delayhe took the gold circlet and slipped it onto her head, with the two ends behindher ears.For a moment nothing happened. Then the girl's head jerked on the pillow andNiall knew that the flash of light had penetrated her sleeping brain. As theyall watched intently, the girl's eyelids began to twitch. Boyd said: \"It'sworking.\"As he spoke, her eyes opened and she stared at Niall. Her hands movedconvulsively under the blanket, as if she was trying to free herself. Then, witha suddenness that startled them all, she sat up, as if impelled by a spring. Hereyes stared directly into Niall's, and she seemed to be on the point of askinghim who he was. Then the eyes seemed to change. She continued to look at Niall,but it was as if she had ceased to be aware of him, or as if she had becomeblind. A moment later she fell backward on to the pillow, and lay there asbefore, her face turned to the ceiling. The only difference was that herbreathing had become faster. But after a few moments, even this subsided, andshe seemed to relapse into deep unconsciousness. Niall pulled the blanket --which had fallen down -- over her breasts; he noticed that Boyd blushed andlooked away.The circlet had become detached from her head, and now Niall picked it up fromthe pillow and readjusted it across her forehead. This time nothing happened.They waited for almost five minutes, but when it became plain that there was nochange in the girl's condition, Niall sighed and turned away.\"Tell your uncle he'll have to make the serum after all.\"Boyd said: \"There's one thing I don't understand. If she woke up like that, whydid she go back to sleep again?\"Dona said: \"Well, people do wake up and go back to sleep again.\"Boyd said lamely: \"Yes, but you see what I mean. . .\"In fact, Niall did see what he meant. He had watched a dozen people recover fromspider venom. Once they were awake, they stayed awake.He turned to Boyd. \"I'll ask Dravig if we can have some spider venom.\"As Niall locked the door once again behind them, Boyd said: \"Can I go and lookat the view from the roof before I go?\"\"Of course.\" Niall turned to Dona. \"Would you mind showing him? Or are youbusy?\"\"No. The children are asleep. He can stay for tea if he likes.\"Boyd said politely: \"If you're sure I'm no trouble.\" But Niall caught theexpression in his eyes as he looked at Dona, and knew that he would be happy tostay all afternoon.It was a relief to be alone again. He flung himself down on the cushions andclosed his eyes. But this immediately brought a return of the giddy sensation --the feeling that his brain was on a swing. He sat up and propped a cushionbetween his back and the wall. As he did so, his eyes fell on the box oflakeweed on the table, and curiosity overcame his tiredness. Kneeling on acushion, he removed the mat from the box and laid it out on the tabletop. Itfelt cold and clammy to the touch. Yet when he placed the palms of his hands onit, there was something delightfully soothing about the slippery dampness -- somuch so that he bent forward and allowed his forehead to rest on the mat. It wasas pleasantly relaxing as a soft pillow. There was undoubtedly somethingpowerfully sensual in its damp coolness; but these feelings soon blended with arelaxed, floating sensation that brought images of massive dark forests whosetrees overshadowed deep lakes. As this continued, he became aware that somethingwas happening to his body. It was difficult to say precisely what this was, forit seemed to consist of a tingling feeling of anticipation. It was as if thecontact between his flesh and the mat of lakeweed was only the beginning of theprocess, and he remained poised on the brink of the first stage.After half a minute or so, he noticed something else: that there seemed to be notransmission of heat from his flesh to the weed; it remained as cool as when hefirst touched it. Even when he wrapped it around his hand, the coolnessremained, exactly as if he had immersed the hand in cold water. But as his handcame into contact with the table-top, he noticed something else that intriguedhim: the wood was warm. It took a few moments for the implications to dawn onhim, and as they did, he sat upright with excitement. The mat was conducting theheat from his body direct to the tabletop, while itself remaining cool. Thismeant that it was not -- as the Steegmaster had suggested -- a purely ritualobject. It served some other purpose. And Niall already had a glimmering of whatthat purpose might be.He folded the mat and replaced it in the box. Then he tiptoed into the corridor-- afraid that his movements might bring Jarita out of her room -- and quietlyunlocked the room next door. Once inside, he locked the door behind him.He removed the mat from its box, and draped it over the back of the chair. Thenhe pulled back the blanket from the girl's body and allowed it to drop on to thefloor.With its small breasts and round, firm belly, there was something oddlychildlike and vulnerable about the naked body. Brown fragments of lakeweed stilladhered to her thighs. He took the mat of lakeweed and carefully spread it overher body. A moment later, he realized that her breathing had become deeper, andthat there were faint spots of color in the pale cheeks. He watched intently,wondering if she was about to wake up; but after several minutes, she stillshowed no further sign of life.He drew the chair up beside the bed, then sat down and placed both his hands onthe mat. The lakeweed felt pleasantly cool under his palms. Yet when he closedhis eyes, he had a sense that there was something wrong. There was a subtlesense of discord that was quite unlike the feeling he had experienced in his ownroom, a tension that made his heart beat irregularly. Then, suddenly, heunderstood. He had placed the mat upside down. In his own room, he had placedthe side that contained the sucker-like fronds against the tabletop. He nowturned it over, so the fronds were against her body. Then, once again, he restedboth hands on the mat.A few moments later he became aware of a tingling sensation in both hands. Itspread to the wrists, then into the lower part of the forearms. There was analmost blissful feeling of relaxation, such as he often experienced whenimmersing his hands and wrists in warm water. It took him a few minutes torealize what was happening: that he was drawing vital energy from the girl.Yet after only a few moments he became aware that the method he was now using --merely resting his hands on the lakeweed -- was inadequate. To experience thefull benefit of this overflowing energy, their bodies had to be in totalcontact.Niall stripped off his tunic and dropped it on the floor; then he loweredhimself slowly onto the girl, allowing his weight to rest on his elbows. He wassix inches taller than she was, and he was concerned that he might be too heavyfor her; in fact, when he was lying on top of her, his weight was so evenlydistributed that it was obvious that, even if she had been awake, she would haveexperienced no discomfort.Even though he had been half-expecting it, what happened next still came as asurprise. She began to breathe more deeply, and a glowing sensation rose upwardfrom her body. It was exactly like turning on a tap; vital energy flowed fromher, then through the mat and into his body. In some strange way, the mat wassucking vital energy from her body, and allowing it to flow into Niall. He triedpressing his lips against hers, but this actually impeded the flow, even when hemoistened them with his tongue. Meanwhile, the girl breathed deeply andregularly, as if accustomed to this process of energy-transfusion; he could evensense that she was enjoying it, glad to be rid of some of the vital fluid thathad accumulated in her body.This process of drinking her energy was among the most unusual sensations Niallhad ever experienced. In some ways it reminded him of the first time he had heldMerlew in his arms -- the same tingling sense of aliveness that had communicateditself from her body to his. But compared to what he was now experiencing, evenembracing Merlew was a poor second best. This was far deeper and more completethan lovemaking; or rather, lovemaking was an incomplete version of thisexperience. When Merlew allowed him to kiss her and press his body against hers,she was retreating into a private world of pleasure, and he was merely aninstrument of her pleasure. This girl was giving unselfishly, giving because hewas a man, and he needed her vital energy; she gave as unselfishly and naturallyas a cow gives milk. In Niall, the flow satisfied some deep masculine craving, acraving of which he had not even been consciously aware a few moments ago. Itwas like a cool drink when the throat is harsh and dry, and it sent waves ofpleasure into remote corners of his being, as if his nerves were telegraph wiresthat stretched out into the remote regions of some unknown country.He was reminded of one of the most striking experiences of his childhood: theday the rains fell on the desert at the foot of the plateau. Black clouds hadbeen carried on the cool westerly breeze, and suddenly water was gushing fromthe sky as though some god had upturned an enormous bucket or diverted awaterfall. As the torrent flooded down a dried watercourse, the ground had burstopen, and bullfrogs pushed their way out of the mud; dry pods exploded andwithin half an hour the ground was covered with a multicolored carpet offlowers, white, red, yellow, blue, orange, and mauve. Soon small pools were fullof tadpoles and algae, and the croaking of frogs was louder than the beating ofthe rain. It was perhaps the greatest exhilaration Niall had experienced duringhis years of childhood. And now, as his being absorbed this girl's energy, hefelt that his own being was bursting into flower, and that unsuspected areas ofawareness were suddenly glowing into life.At the end of five minutes, his body felt sated with pleasure; he was like astarving man who has eaten an enormous meal. When he stood up again, his nakedbody was glowing as if a thousand points of light were sparkling over thesurface of the flesh. He dropped into the chair -- an old-fashioned woodenarmchair with a cushion attached to its seat -- and allowed himself to relaxwith a deep sigh. His heart seemed to have slowed to half its normal speed.Now, at least, he understood why the assassins had brought the girl with them.She was their source of energy, the renewer of their vitality. While his bodyhad been in contact with hers, he had even been able to sense the presence ofthose other men who had preceded him. He experienced no sense of jealousy; itwas her business to give energy -- she was willing to give to anyone who couldreceive it from her.And now, with a sudden flash of insight, he also understood why Veig had behavedso strangely in the girl's presence. Surely it must be because his brother hadsomehow sensed that she had the power to renew his depleted energies? Thisthought awakened a surge of hope and optimism. His own sense of glowing vitalityconvinced him that this girl could cure Veig's sickness -- that it would be asimple matter for his brother to draw energy from her body until his own vitalpowers had been restored. . . This thought so excited Niall that he started tohis feet and had taken a stride toward the door before remembering that he wasnaked. Then, as he started to pull on his tunic, he remembered the old man'swarning about impatience -- he had paid the price of ignoring it once alreadytoday. The thought sobered him; he dropped the tunic on the floor and sat downagain.When he gazed at the sleeping girl, he felt a mixture of pity and gratitude. Shecarried within her the secret of life; yet men had seized her for their ownpurposes, and turned her into a kind of milch-cow. As she lay with closed eyes,she looked like a corpse; the spots of color had vanished from her cheeks, andher breathing was hardly visible. When he probed her mind, it was like enteringprimeval darkness, without even a flicker of the unconscious life of dreams.Earlier in the day, when he had entered the mind of the girl in the hospital, hehad been aware of her sleeping consciousness, like a faint glow on the horizon.In this girl's mind, there was merely emptiness, like eternal night.He suddenly experienced a powerful desire to express his gratitude, to return toher a little of the brimming vitality that she had allowed him to absorb, andwhich had, in turn, raised his own vitality to a still higher level. The mat oflakeweed had half-slipped from her body, and it had the effect of making herseem somehow pathetic and abandoned, as if she had been thrown there from apassing cart. Niall leaned forward and removed it, then turned it over andreplaced it on her body. Then he once again lay on top of her, resting hisweight on his elbows. Yet his position made him feel uncomfortable; it seemedsomehow oddly wrong. He slipped off her and lay beside her on the bed; then,placing one arm under her waist, and the other on her buttock, he lifted heruntil she was resting on top of him. She was surprisingly light, but thecompletely relaxed state of her body made it difficult to keep her in position;he had to reach down and straighten her legs, then readjust the mat betweenthem, and hold her in position with his hands on both buttocks. Her face turnedsideways, so that her cheek rested against his mouth.Niall allowed himself to relax into a state of total receptivity, until hisconsciousness was like an empty vessel. He realized now why his first contacthad produced a subtle sense of discord. He had been expecting to absorb energyfrom her, and this was opposed by the polarity of the mat. Moreover, he had beenlying on top of her, and the mat was designed to conduct energy upward, againstthe force of gravity. Now all he had to do was to use the mat to absorb some ofthe energy that was now throbbing inside him; he did this by imagining that theenergy was accumulating in the skin of his chest and thighs. At a certain point,he imagined that the energy was being absorbed from him by the cool and slipperylakeweed, and, as this happened, he felt this process taking place. A momentlater the skin of her face became warm as it rested against his lips.The process of giving energy was, in an obvious sense, the opposite of theprocess of receiving it. Yet in another way, they were curiously similar. Tobegin with, their individual identities dissolved away, and united like tworaindrops. This union turned them, in effect, into lovers, as if they hadmutually given themselves to one another. In some primitive sense, he had becomeher husband. Giving became an intense pleasure -- so intense that, a few momentslater, he experienced a compulsion to repeat the process, once again summoningenergy into the skin of his chest and thighs, and then allowing it to pass intoher through the lakeweed. He was aware as he did so that he was repeating somedeep universal process that had existed since the beginning of time.The third time he repeated the transmission, he became aware that she wasresponding. The pleasure of receiving vital energy was stirring her back intowakefulness. In the darkness of her consciousness, he could sense a glow likethe rising dawn. A moment later, her breathing faltered, and he had to make aneffort to control his own excitement and calm the beating of his heart. Shestirred, as if in her sleep, and moved her head, so that her lips were nowresting directly against his. He could feel the fluttering of her eyelids, andthe lips parted.A moment later he screamed aloud in pain as her teeth sank into his lower lip.In his state of total concentration, the shock was like an explosion inside hishead. Even when he twisted sideways and she fell on to the bed, she continued tobite until he thought her teeth would meet through his flesh. A frantic pushreleased him, and she fell off the bed and on to the floor. He scrambled off thebed, half-expecting her to attack him. But her position on the floor -- facedownward, with one leg twisted under the other -- remained unchanged.His first reaction was anger. The pain was agonizing, and tears were runningdown his cheeks and mingling with the blood that ran onto his chest. He seizedher garment, which still lay on the floor, and pressed it to his lower lip. Whenthe cloth had absorbed most of the blood, he cautiously prodded the torn fleshwith the tip of one finger, at the same time probing from inside with histongue. To his relief, his tongue and fingertip failed to meet through theflesh. But the lip itself was already swelling, as if from a violent blow.He turned her over roughly with his foot. As she flopped onto her back, heobserved that her eyes were now open. The mouth was also open, and a trickle ofblood, mixed with saliva, ran down her face. The gray flesh reminded him of thecorpse he had seen that morning in the hospital, and his heart suddenlycontracted with fear. If she was dead, he had destroyed his last link with themagician. He dropped on his knees beside her, but his heart was pounding soviolently that it was impossible to achieve the relaxation necessary to probeher mind. Instead, he seized her wrist and tried to take her pulse; when hefailed to find it, he suddenly became convinced that she was dead, andexperienced a cold sense of despair. He bent his head and placed his ear againsther left breast. A moment later, as his own breathing became calmer, he was ableto detect a faint pulse. The relief was so enormous that he closed his eyes, andexpelled his breath in a long sigh.He slid both hands underneath her, and lifted her onto the bed. A thin trickleof blood ran from the corner of her mouth, and although he knew it was his ownblood, the sight disturbed him. He wiped it off with his handkerchief, thenclosed the staring eyes.Now that his alarm had subsided, he was able to probe her mind. As he expected,it was totally blank, without any hint of consciousness. He stared down at her,frowning with perplexity. His first assumption had been that she had awakened,recognized him as an alien presence, and instinctively attacked him. But in thatcase, she would still be awake -- or at least show some sign of revivingconsciousness.Was it conceivable that she was still being controlled by the magician? Thethought stirred the hairs on the back of his neck. Then he dismissed the idea.Everything that had happened so far convinced him that the magician communicatedwith his servants through the pendants. And these were now safely confinedwithin the magnetic field of the stone jars in the cellar.Yet it was equally difficult to believe that this girl had regainedconsciousness, attacked him, then plunged back into this state of profoundunconsciousness. As he stared down at the still face, still pressing thehandkerchief against his swollen lip, he knew that it would be absurd to takefurther risks; the pendants must be taken to the white tower. He covered herwith the blanket, folded the lakeweed and replaced it in its box, then left theroom and locked the door behind him.Although he could hear voices, and the sound of pans clattering in the kitchen,he met no one on his way downstairs; this was a relief, since he had no wish toexplain his swollen lip. At the top of the cellar steps, he paused to light theoil lamp, then trod carefully down into the cool gloom.The black stone jars were exactly as he had left them. He placed the lamp on thefloor, and removed the plug from the neck of the nearest one -- it had jammed intight, and required some twisting to remove. He reached inside cautiously, butas his fingers made contact with the pendant, he realized that it was completelyinert. This was the pendant whose chain he had snapped in his impatience toseparate them; he dropped it into the pocket of his tunic, then moved the oillamp close to the second jar.This plug came out easily. He reached into the depths of the jar and found thechain -- it was also inert. But as his hand emerged, the back brushed againstthe neck of the jar, and he detected a sharp edge. He picked up the lamp andheld it over the jar. There was a crack, about an eighth of an inch wide at thetop, running vertically down the jar. His first thought was that he had causedit himself when he sealed the jar with the heavy plug. But when he examined itin the lamplight, he could see that it ran all the way down the side of the jar.It seemed unlikely that he could have caused such a crack simply by dropping theplug into the neck. He held the lamp close to the other side of the jar. Here hecould detect a hairline crack that ran from the neck down to the base. But whenhe reached inside the neck, and tried to pull the two halves apart, it wasimpossible. This second crack was apparently only on the surface. Yet heremained puzzled and vaguely disturbed. It was possible, of course, that thecrack had been in the jar all the time, and that he had simply failed to noticeit. But he found this hard to believe. As he dropped the pendant into the otherside of his tunic pocket -- making sure there was the maximum distance betweenthem -- he was unable to suppress a shiver of apprehension.It vanished as he stepped out into the pale afternoon sunlight. The sky wasalready blue with dusk; the north wind seemed to carry the scent of autumn. Menwere returning home from work; a pregnant woman came past carrying two bags ofshopping. It was the hour of the day that Niall loved best, the time forrelaxation after work, when the world seemed full of a warm glow of happiness.It had been a long, and in some ways a frustrating day; but now that he lookedback on it, it seemed that luck had been with him.Since there were so many people in the square, he decided not to approach thewhite tower from the south side, which faced the headquarters of the SpiderLord; this would be inviting attention and curiosity. Instead he crossed thesquare as if approaching the bridge that led to the slave quarter. On this sideof the tower there was a wide-open space consisting partly of grass and partlyof hard pavement. Since this was usually deserted, it was easy to cross thegrass with the certainty that the tower itself would conceal him frompedestrians on the other side of the square.But even when he was halfway across the grass, he became aware of a feeling ofinner discord. It was the same sensation that he had experienced earlier in theday, when he had approached the tower carrying the stone figurine. Now it waseven stronger. Instead of feeling a kind of magnetic attraction as he approachedthe tower -- not unlike the feeling a dowser experiences in the presence ofunderground water -- there was a sense of repulsion that produced a sensationlike walking into a strong wind. He knew that it would be pointless to try toenter its force field; it was warning him to keep his distance. Therefore, heremoved both pendants from his pocket, and placed them on the blue-gray marblethat surrounded the base of the tower. To his surprise, the feeling of repulsionremained, although less powerful than a moment ago. He stood there, bewildered,wondering what to do next. A moment later uncertainty changed to relief as theold man walked through the solid wall, stepping out of its milky surface likesomeone emerging from water. Niall waited for an explanation. Instead, the oldman raised his right arm and pointed at the gold chains, which were lying a fewfeet away.Niall said: \"They are pendants, like the one. . .\"But before he could finish the sentence, a narrow beam of pale orange lightemanated from the end of the old man's index finger and struck one of thependants. This glowed into a bright golden color, then melted and coagulatedinto a globule which seemed to simmer and sizzle on the marble. Then as themarble itself began to glow and become red hot, the golden ball became smallerand smaller, like a drop of water evaporating on a hot plate. As this happened,Niall observed that the other pendant was no longer lying where he had placedit; then he saw that it had moved close to the edge of the platform. For amoment he assumed that this was due to the force of the energy blast emanatingfrom the old man's finger; then, with a shock, he realized that the gold chainwas moving with an odd rolling motion, as if trying to escape. Before it couldreach the edge, it had been caught in the orange beam, and had turned into apool of liquid metal. Seconds later, it was another golden ball, still rollingtoward the edge of the platform. It became smaller and smaller, thendisappeared, leaving the marble glowing with dull heat that Niall could feelfrom a distance of five yards.Niall asked: \"Why was that necessary?\"\"Have you ever heard of a booby trap?\"Niall said doubtfully: \"A kind of practical joke?\"\"In this case, more than a joke. To have brought them into the tower would havebeen a disaster.\"\"But I brought one in the other day.\"\"That has also been destroyed.\"\"But why did you let it in?\"\"Because I did not know then what I have learned since.\"\"What was that?\"\"That these devices can be animated with some kind of living force.\"\"How did you find out?\"\"The device that you brought into the tower was able to neutralize the electricfield in which I enclosed it.\"\"What happened?\"\"The alarm system gave warning of an intruder, and specified the electromagneticenclosure. By then the device had once again become inert. I vaporized itimmediately.\"\"Did the alarm system give any indication of the nature of the intruder?\"\"None -- merely that it was a living presence.\"Niall said: \"It was the magician.\"The old man shrugged. \"If so, it is too late to do anything about it.\"Niall was concerned. \"Do you think he could have learned anything?\"\"Unfortunately that is impossible to say. It was not noticed until it tried tointerfere with the circuits of the Steegmaster.\"\"Great goddess!\"\"These two devices would have been even more dangerous. When two are broughtinto contact, their power is greatly augmented.\"\"I know.\" Niall remembered the cracked stone jar. \"That's why I separated them.\"\"But you were too impatient and left part of one chain entangled with theother.\"Niall colored. \"But I didn't think the chains made any difference.\"\"That is what you were intended to think. In fact, they are a part of thedevice.\"\"I'm sorry.\""},{"pageContent":"\"That is unnecessary. Now that we understand the danger, it is possible toanticipate it.\"Niall said: \"But do you understand how it works?\"\"No. I said I understand the danger. But since I am designed for purely rationalthinking, I am unable to understand the principles of magic.\"The words caused a prickling sensation in Niall's scalp. \"But are you sure it ismagic?\"\"The ability to make living forces manifest in dead matter must be defined asmagic.\"\"But is there nothing we can do about it?\"\"At the moment I lack information to make a competent assessment. You must tryto learn more.\"Niall asked in perplexity: \"But how?\"The old man shook his head. Niall waited for him to speak -- then, as thesilence lengthened, realized that he was not going to speak. His sense of risingfrustration was cut short by a recognition that came as a shock: that the oldman was not going to speak because he had nothing to say. Suddenly, for thefirst time, Niall realized fully that the old man was a machine, and that itwould be as pointless to feel impatient with him as to feel angry with a clockwhose hands have ceased to move.He turned without speaking, and walked in the direction of the headquarters ofthe Spider Lord. For the first time, he realized that he was alone. Two brown wolf spiders stood on either side of the black doors; they recognizedhim and lowered themselves to the ground. Then, seeing that he wished to enter,one of them sent a telepathic message to the guard inside, and the doors swungopen. The death spider who stood in the hall was squat and powerful, bearing adistinct resemblance to the late Captain Skorbo -- most of the Spider Lord'spersonal guard came from the same distant province. His crooked legs made iteasy to prostrate himself, but also made the gesture seem somehow disrespectful.\"Is the Lord Dravig here?\"\"No, sire. He has gone home. Do you wish me to send for him?\"\"No, thank you.\" Niall was speaking slowly, realizing that this spider wasunskilled in communicating with humans. \"I wish to speak to Asmak.\"The spider gazed back blankly; the name evidently meant nothing to him. Niallsaid: \"He is the commander of the aerial survey.\" He accompanied the words witha mental image of a spider balloon.\"Please wait.\"The guard turned and ascended the marble staircase. He could have summoned anyspider in the building by a telepathic message; but this would have beenregarded as impolite, like a human being shouting for a servant.Niall was alone in the hall, with its curiously stale air, and smell of ancientdust. He had never understood why the spiders made no attempt to keep theirheadquarters clean. Now, suddenly, he realized that it must be some atavisticmemory of days when all spiders lived in dusty corners. It meant that dust andcobwebs denoted comfort.The guard had reappeared on the stairs. He was followed by another death spider,whose glossy black coat and small stature revealed that he had still not reachedadulthood. This spider lowered himself to the ground with a grace that wastotally unlike the crablike awkwardness of the guard.Niall asked: \"Are you Asmak?\"\"No, sire, I am his son. I am known as Grel.\"He said \"known as\" because, in the human sense of the word, few spiders hadproper names; being telepathic, they had no need for names when addressing oneanother. Most spider names were adopted for the convenience of humanintercourse.\"Please stand up.\" Grel had remained in the position of homage, and Niall couldsense his nervousness. \"The Lord Dravig advised me to speak to your father.\"\"He is not here, sire.\" The young spider straightened up; in the uprightposition, he was about the same height as Niall. The folded fangs seemedundeveloped, and the smooth black hair that covered the body looked as soft asthe fur of a kitten. It seemed to Niall that the black eyes shone withintelligence, although he was aware that this might be merely the effect of theamount of light they reflected -- compared with the eyes of an adult spider,they seemed to be covered with a thin layer of oil.\"Where is he?\"\"At his workplace. Would you like me to take you to him?\"Niall started to refuse, then changed his mind. To begin with, he wanted achance to talk to the young spider.\"Is it far away?\"\"No, very close.\"\"Yes. Thank you. I would like to see him.\"The guard opened the double doors for them. But Niall could sense his deepdisapproval. So could the young spider, and he followed Niall outside with avisible air of guilt. But as soon as the doors had closed, and they were outsideon the pavement, this evaporated; he was obviously proud to be seen in publicwith the ruler of the spider city. He asked eagerly: \"Shall I summon yourcharioteers?\"\"No, thank you. If it is close, I would prefer to walk.\"The spider led the way to the side street that ran out of the southwest side ofthe square. The pavement was thronged with people, and Niall drew his cloakaround him to avoid recognition. But at the end of two blocks, he felt so warmthat he allowed it to fall open again.\"Grel.\"\"Yes, sire?\" The young spider stopped, and turned respectfully.\"Not so fast. My human legs are shorter than yours.\"Grel looked abashed. \"I'm sorry, sire.\" He walked on with exaggerated slowness.But since his stride was about ten feet long, Niall still had to walk at a briskpace to keep up.They were walking in the direction of the old part of the city; this, untilrecently, had been the women's quarter, and had been forbidden to males. A highwall, whose enormous stone blocks required no cement, divided it from theeastern half of the city. Now its iron gates stood open and unguarded. Niall'shistory lessons had taught him that this wall dated from ancient times, althoughit had been rebuilt as a historic showpiece in the twenty-first century.Now, instead of passing through the nearest gate, they turned south along thebroad avenue, and walked parallel to the wall which divided it down the center.It was obvious that this had once been the main thoroughfare of the city. Theavenue was a steep incline, peaking in a hilltop surmounted by a tower. Niallhad often wondered what lay on the far side.\"How old are you?\"\"Five and a half, sire.\"\"And are you a member of the Death Lord's personal guard?\"\"No, sire. I am the junior assistant to the lady Sidonia.\" Sidonia was thecommander of the Spider Lord's guard.\"You speak English very well.\" (What Niall meant was: \"You communicate in humanlanguage very well,\" but he knew that he would be understood.)The young spider glowed with satisfaction. \"Thank you, sire. The lady Sidoniataught me herself.\" Then, to Niall's astonishment, he loped across the avenue,and proceeded to climb the wall with the agility of an acrobat. Spiders, likeflies, are able to climb vertical surfaces, but the sheer weight of the giantspiders meant that few of them attempted to practice this accomplishment. Grel'slightness and speed carried him to the top of the wall with the ease of a birdin flight. His objective, Niall realized, was a large bird that had perched onthe far side of one of the gate towers that subdivided the wall. As if aware ofits danger, the bird stretched its legs and raised its head, as if about tolaunch into flight. It was too late. The young spider took advantage of thesloping roof of the gate tower to conceal himself as he slid, like some bonelessmollusk, over the parapet; then, as the bird saw the movement and prepared tofly, launched himself like a projectile, striking the bird as it rose into theair. Niall expected to see them both crash down on to the pavement below; infact, they landed on the parapet, then fell backwards. There was a brief andpathetic squawk. A moment later, the spider reappeared on the edge of the roofand lowered himself to the ground on a length of silk, which he jerked free andreabsorbed into his body as he was crossing the street. His jaws closed on thebird with a crunch that made Niall wince.As if suddenly recalling Niall's presence, the young spider became apologetic.\"I beg your pardon, sire. Do you care for bird?\"\"Not uncooked.\" Niall found it impossible to smile. Now, suddenly, he understoodwhy the guard had shown disapproval. Although he possessed the strength andspeed of an adult, Grel was as impulsive as a child. And Niall knew enough aboutspiders to recognize that they attached enormous importance to self-control.The young spider gripped the bird in his tarsal claws -- he was able to balancecomfortably on the other six legs -- and tore out feathers with his jaws,scattering them by blowing them out of his mouth. The breeze carried them awaydown the street. Then he bit into the breast with the relish of a schoolboysinking his teeth into an apple.Niall asked: \"How far do we have to go?\"\"Not very far.\" Since the spider was communicating telepathically, he couldspeak with his mouth full. Looking up the wide, empty avenue, Niall experienceda twinge of dismay, recognizing suddenly that a spider's idea of a shortdistance was based upon the length of its stride, which was more than twice thatof a human being.At least Grel was now walking more slowly. And as he strolled beside him, Niallallowed himself to relax and to examine his companion more closely. As he atethe bird, Grel had left his mind open, as if to apologize for not giving Niallhis full attention. The result was interesting. Niall's response to thecrunching jaws -- and to the drops of blood that fell on to the pavement -- wasa certain repulsion. Yet he was also able to enter the young spider's mind, andshare his pleasure in the tender flesh. For a spider, eating a bird which hadonly just been killed was an intensely interesting activity which demanded hisfull attention. To begin with, the flesh was still permeated with the flavor oflife, which Niall perceived as a warm glow. Then there was the fascination ofthe bird's craw, which contained two small rodents -- baby rats -- and a largeinsect like a dragon fly. These were an additional bonus, a delightful fringebenefit. For the spider, the bird tasted like a succulent fruit, in the depthsof which someone had concealed delicious sweetmeats. Niall actually began tofind himself feeling hungry.It was curiously pleasant to allow himself to relax into the spider's vitalrhythms. He was brimming with a kind of cheerful well-being which is totallyunlike the normal state of human consciousness. By comparison with spiders,Niall realized, human beings are hopelessly self-divided, even the simplest.Their minds have been trained to scan reality, looking for meaning, like a birdof prey looking down at a broad landscape, watching for any sign of movementthat might betray a small animal. This, in turn, means that a part of humanawareness is permanently passive, waiting for something to happen. Grel'sconsciousness was completely and magically different. He had no need of\"thought.\" Consequently, he lived in a totally real universe in which everythingwas fascinating in its own right.And this, Niall now realized, explained why the spiders had developed theirtremendous will power. When they wanted something, they wanted it with theirwhole being. If it was bad for them, their instincts told them so. \"Thinking\"was unnecessary. So they used the secret powers of the mind -- powers of whichhuman beings are scarcely aware -- as naturally as an athlete uses his strengthand agility.What excited Niall was that he now shared the secret. He realized, for example,that when they had set out on this walk he had been very tired. Now, althoughhis legs were still aching, he was aware that he was not genuinely tired. It wasan illusion caused by the fact that he thought he was tired. As he shared themind-world of the young spider, he began to feel a glow of interest and purposethat made him aware that he was the one who decided whether he was tired or not.Even as this thought took shape in his mind, the ache in his legs disappeared,and was replaced by a tingling sense of energy.Grel dropped the bird into the gutter. Niall was surprised; it still contained agreat deal of tender meat. Then he realized that they were approaching the toweron the hilltop.\"Is your father here?\"\"Yes. This is the headquarters of the aerial survey.\"The tower was built of black stone, and was therefore known among humans as theBlack Tower; it had a sinister reputation among city dwellers as a prison, andeven a torture chamber. Built as part of the wall, it was obviously intended asa vantage point to survey the whole city. Beyond the hilltop the wall -- and theavenue -- turned westward around the old part of the city. To the south, theflat winter landscape was touched by the rays of the setting sun; the sea, whichlay on the horizon, was already in shadow. On the far side of the thirty-milestrip of ocean lay the deserts of North Khaybad, the land where Niall was born,and where his father's ashes were now scattered on the wind.Grel manipulated an iron ring and pushed open the massive door. They were met bythe smell of cold and dust that seemed so typical of spider dwellings. There wasalso a trace of another smell, which released in Niall a curious flash ofnostalgia. It was, in fact, a rather unpleasant smell, a combination of rottingvegetation and decaying meat. This was the smell of the porifids, the primitiveorganism that provided the gas used to inflate the spider balloons. It broughtback to Niall the journey to the Delta that had culminated in his encounter withthe empress plant, the extraterrestrial creature that the spiders worshiped asthe goddess Nuada.They were in a circular chamber, whose low ceiling was supported by stonecolumns. A narrow flight of steps ran up to the next floor; as the door slammed,a man in the uniform of a worker came to the head of the stairs and peered atthem through the gloom. Light streamed through the open door behind him.\"Who's there?\"Niall said: \"We have come to see the Lord Asmak.\"The man -- obviously an overseer -- said: \"No one is allowed in this placewithout the permission of the Spider Lord.\"He looked so combative that for a moment Niall felt disconcerted. Then Grelstepped out of the shadows. \"Please tell my father we are here.\"The overseer started with astonishment; then he shrugged and went back into theroom, closing the door firmly behind him, and leaving them in almost totaldarkness. Niall, irritated by this display of bad manners, and by theimplication that they had to wait there like unwelcome guests, mounted thestairs -- Grel walked behind him as a matter of protocol -- and groped for thelatch of the door. The chamber beyond proved to be large and well lighted, withpressure lamps suspended from hooks on the wall. Most of the room was occupiedby a huge circular work-table, which must have been fifteen feet in diameter,and whose top was occupied by a deflated spider balloon, whose blue-white silkglowed softly in the lamplight. The men who stood around the table were occupiedin sewing together the edges of the balloon. On the far side of the room therewas a large glass tank whose sides were as high as a man; in the depths of itsslimy green water lay the porifids -- short for porifera mephitis -- whose smellpermeated the room. It was, in fact, too faint to be unpleasant; porifids onlyproduced their asphyxiating stench when plunged in total darkness -- as in theinterior of a spider balloon.The men went on working with averted eyes, concentrating on their sewing. But asGrel closed the door, the nearest one shot them a sideways glance. His eyeswidened, and he dropped the scissors he was holding. Niall realized withembarrassment that he had been recognized. He shook his head, and started toturn away, but he was too late to prevent the man from falling onto his knees.He said in a low voice: \"Please, go on with your work.\"But this led the others to look up, and as soon as they recognized Niall, theyalso fell onto their knees. This was not -- as with the spiders -- a matter ofreverence for the living representative of the great goddess, but merely thefact that these men had been trained to absolute obedience to the will of theirsuperiors. In the days before freedom, the slightest failure to show properrespect could lead to brutal punishment. A habit formed over many generationscould not be uprooted in a few months.Niall grimaced with embarrassment. \"Please, get up.\"At that moment, the door on the far side of the room opened, and the overseerreturned. He stared at the kneeling men with incredulity -- as if suspectingsome kind of joke -- and his face reddened with anger. Then he also recognizedthe emissary of the goddess, and fell onto his knees.Niall cleared his throat. \"Is the Lord Asmak ready to see me?\"The man stammered: \"Forgive me, sire, I did not recognize you.\"\"No need for apology. You did your duty.\" He crossed the room and opened thedoor, which led to a further flight of stairs. The overseer seized his hand ashe went past.\"You see, sire, this place is supposed to be secret. . .\"\"Please, say no more about it.\" He disengaged his hand with some difficulty andmounted the stairs; Grel followed behind. Niall could sense his amusement.The next door led into a room that was obviously a warehouse, piled high withfolded spider balloons. The same was true of the next floor, and the next. Thesixth floor was occupied by large tanks of porifids, and wooden containers ofthe white, wormlike grubs on which they were fed; these smelled considerablyworse than the porifids.At the head of the steps leading to the seventh floor stood a tall death spider,whose natural dignity and grace reminded Niall of Dravig. He stood back to allowNiall to enter, then lowered himself to the ground in homage. As they exchangedformal greetings, Niall realized that he had already met the commander of theaerial survey. Asmak had been present on the previous day, at the trial ofSkorbo's former associates. They had not communicated directly; but since Niallhad shared the consciousness of every spider in the room, he had become aware oftheir individual identities. Now he felt as if he was encountering an oldfriend.The formalities over, the spider waited respectfully for Niall to speak first.\"The Lord Dravig advised me to come and see you.\"\"I am honored. In what way can I be of service?\"\"As the commander of the aerial survey, you must be familiar with the lands tothe north?\"\"I have flown over them many times.\"\"Dravig believes that Skorbo's killers came from these northlands.\"\"That is possible. But it is also possible that they came from the south, east,or west.\"\"Where do you think they came from?\"The spider made a gesture whose human equivalent would have been shaking hishead. \"Dravig asked me the same question. And I had to admit that I could notanswer.\"\"Dravig says there are legends of an underground city. Have you any idea wherethat might be?\"\"None. If there is such a place, it is so well concealed that our patrols havenever even suspected its existence.\"Niall remembered the underground city of Dira, and realized how difficult itwould be for an aerial patrol to detect its existence.\"Do your patrols fly close to the ground?\"\"Sometimes. But it can be dangerous, particularly in the mountains. That is howSkorbo crashed.\"\"Skorbo crashed? Do you know where?\"\"Yes.\"Niall felt a tingle of excitement. \"Could you take me there?\"\"Of course.\"\"How far is it?\"\"Only a few hours -- if the wind is blowing in the right direction.\"\"Ah, yes.\" Niall had forgotten the wind. It was, in fact, possible for a spiderballoon to fly against the wind; the spider could use its will power to createan opposing force, so the balloon chose a path between two vectors. Niall hadexperienced the effect on his return journey from the Delta. But it wasexhausting work, like rowing a boat against the current.\"But of course, it is unnecessary to wait for the wind to change.\"\"Unnecessary?\" Niall failed to understand him.Asmak said: \"I am familiar with the area and I can describe it to you.\"Niall said politely: \"Then please do so.\"\"Would my lord care to follow me?\" Asmak turned and led the way across the room.Puzzled and intrigued, Niall followed him up another flight of stairs. The doorat the top led out onto a flat roof, which was surrounded by a crenellatedparapet. The sky overhead had turned to a deep blue, and stars were visible onthe eastern horizon. But in the west, the landscape was bathed in red sunlight.The wind that blew from the mountains carried a hint of snow.Asmak led him to the edge of the roof that faced northward. The mountains werealmost invisible in blue shadows; only the western slopes reflected the settingsun. Niall leaned against the parapet, placing his foot in the embrasure.Asmak raised his tarsal claw and pointed toward the mountains -- a gesture thatspiders had learned from their human servants. \"All these lands that you can seeare the domain of the Death Lord.\"As he spoke, Niall experienced a curious sensation, as if his body had become aslight as a feather, and was floating up into the air. It was so unexpected thathe reached out in panic and gripped the parapet with both hands. Contact withthe cold stone made him realize that he was still standing securely on the roof.Asmak said apologetically: \"I beg your pardon. I should have warned you. . .\"With a twinge of embarrassment, Niall realized that the illusion had been due tothe spider's power of suggestion. As soon as he relaxed, he once again felthimself rising gently from the roof, and floating out above the rooftops. For amoment or so, his mind divided into two parts, one of which continued to beaware of his body. Then, fascinated by the panorama that was unfolding belowhim, he forgot his body, and became absorbed in the strange sensation of flyingthrough space.What was happening was that the spider was describing a typical reconnaissanceflight, exactly as a human being might describe it in words. But since he wasusing images and sensations, Niall experienced what he was \"saying\" as a seriesof visual impressions. Never before had he experienced such a clear sense ofsharing the mind of another -- not even at the trial of Skorbo's associates,when he had been privileged to enter the collective consciousness of thespiders. And it was, he now realized, as a consequence of that experience thathe was now able to enter the mind of Asmak.He could see the city -- which was bathed in sunlight -- as clearly as if he wasin a spider balloon. Asmak's recall of detail was clearly extraordinary; he knewthis terrain so well that his mind had photographed it with the accuracy of acamera -- only a blurring effect toward the horizon revealed that this wasmerely a mental image. The mountains in the distance looked exactly as theylooked from the roof of the palace. To the northwest of the city, across a rangeof low hills, Niall could see the city of the bombardier beetles, with itstwisted red towers which were actually spiral cones made of beeswax. As theyfloated over the river that divided the city from east to west, Niall lookedwith curiosity toward the east -- a region he never explored -- and saw that theriver lost itself in a region of low hills covered with woodland. Among theseundulating treetops, he was intrigued to see a building like a half-derelictcastle on a hilltop, and pointed toward it. \"What is that?\"\"A ruin. This land is full of ruins.\"The words were factual, but for Niall they brought a wave of melancholy, animage of this land as it had been in the remote past, when men took it forgranted that they were lords of the Earth.Now they were passing over the slave quarter, flying low enough to see thepeople who thronged the streets. What puzzled Niall was that all the slaveslooked absolutely identical, as if they were all copies of the same person. Thenthe answer dawned on him: to a spider, all human beings looked alike.Beyond the slave quarter lay an area of empty houses which had once been themiddle-class residential area of the city. Slaves had no use for such houses,with their overgrown back gardens that might shelter dangerous predators, sothis part of the city had been left to fall into ruin.Soon they were passing over the northern edge of the city, where the main roadturned northwest toward the city of the bombardier beetles. Another road,obviously in a poor state of repair, continued toward the mountains, then lostitself in an area of brown heather, which clothed the slopes of a low range ofhills. On the far side of these lay more dense woodland, in which the trees wereso close together that the ground was invisible.Among the treetops to the right, Niall glimpsed a sheet of water that reflectedthe blue of the sky. \"What is that?\"\"An abandoned quarry.\"\"Could we see it?\"As if changing direction in midair, the spider obediently veered to the east. Amoment later they were poised above a water-filled quarry that was at least amile wide -- it reminded him of the disused marble quarry that the bombardierbeetles used for their explosive exhibitions. As far as Niall could see, noflowing streams fed this enormous stagnant lake. On its northern edge, avertical cliff face plunged into the dark water. But the southern edge of thequarry shelved more gently, and there was even a kind of beach. As Niall lookeddown at this he saw something that made his heart leap: a gently heaving surfaceof brown lakeweed that covered the shallows to a distance of about fifty yardsfrom the shore. As far as he could see, it was similar to the mat of lake-weedthat he had found in the abandoned hideout. But when he tried to look moreclosely, the image blurred, as he reached the limit of the spider's perceptions.He asked: \"Have you ever landed near the lake?\"\"No. We have no reason to go there.\"Niall recalled that death spiders disliked water. Asmak even avoided floatingabove the dark surface, preferring to skirt the edge of the quarry.Now once again they were moving toward the mountains. They were crossing ahollow land that looked like a swamp: rivulets of brown water, brown tussocks ofcoarse swamp grass, and areas of a bright green vegetation that reminded Niallof the Delta. Then came wooded foothills, whose twisted, olive-colored treescovered a landscape of rocky outcrops. Then came the mountains, whose greenlower slopes soon turned into barren expanses of gray rock and scree which rosesteeply until they vanished into the mist. They passed into a black raincloud,and Niall was aware of drops of water blowing against his face, although when heraised his hand to brush them away, he discovered that his skin was dry.The mist flew past them, then dissolved suddenly into dazzling sunlight. Thescenery below them was breathtaking: deep valleys, some of them descending tothe plains on either side, bare rocky slopes with knife-edged outcrops of rock,and streams of white rushing water that plunged down the mountain side and woundtheir way into sky-blue lakes that filled the hollows. As they floated above oneof these lakes, Niall was able to see through its crystal-clear water into thebrown mud in its depths.On the lower slopes of the mountains there were patches of woodland and anoccasional ruined building; one of them looked like an ancient monastery, withits bell tower still defying the elements, another like a shattered fortress.And on the coastal plain that lay between the foothills of two domelikemountains there were even the remains of a town. Whenever such a place arousedhis curiosity, the spider's mind obligingly enlarged the object, so that Niallwas able to study it in detail. Now he found himself looking down on adesolation of roofless houses and rubble-filled streets that left no doubt thatthe town had been deserted for centuries. It had once been fortified, for it wassurrounded by an embankment of earth, with lookout posts built of stone. Acloser view of the town revealed smoke-blackened walls and charred roof beams.On the banks of the river that flowed through its center lay the blackenedremains of several boats. Nearby on the mud was an object that was unmistakablythe ribcage of a man. A few feet away lay a human skull.\"Does this place have a name?\"\"Men call it Cibilla, after their moon goddess.\"\"And who destroyed it?\"\"I do not know. It happened in the days of the great war between spiders andhumans, long before I was born.\"\"But do you people keep no records?\"\"Records? I do not understand the word.\"Now, at last, Niall was able to understand why the spiders were unable to offerany suggestions about the whereabouts of the kingdom of the magician. Unlikehuman beings, they seemed to have no legends and traditions that enshrined theknowledge of the past. It was also clear that, in this vast wilderness of rockand barren moorland, the entrance to an underground city would be virtuallyundetectable, even to a fleet of a million spider balloons. The underground cityof Dira had remained undetected for many years, even though its goatherds andshepherds had risked discovery every day as they drove their flocks out tograze. And these misty hills, with their caves and rocky outcrops, offered farmore protection than the glaring desert landscape on the shores of the greatsalt lake.\"Could we go higher?\"\"Of course.\"A moment later, they were surveying the same landscape from a height of at leastten thousand feet. Now he was able to see that the mountains stretched northwardlike a gigantic backbone, bending eventually to the northeast. To the left lay awide flat plane that stretched toward the sea; in the eastern plain there werelakes and rivers, and beyond them, a lower range of mountains. From this heighthe was able to see that the backbone was broken in two places by widetransversal valleys, the nearest of which was about ten miles away.Asmak pointed toward it. \"That is the limit of the domain of the Death Lord. Wecall it the Valley of the Dead.\"\"Who chose that limit?\"\"Why, the Death Lord himself.\"\"Have you ever been beyond it?\"\"A few miles only. More than that would serve no purpose.\"Niall could see his point; the mountains beyond the Valley of the Dead lookedmore bleak and forbidding than those that lay behind them to the south.\"Please take me to the boundary.\"With the speed of thought, they were hovering over a wide green valley, in thecenter of which there was a long and narrow lake, from whose ends issued tworivers. The Valley of the Dead must have been carved by a glacier, for its sideswere steep, towering up to a height of more than a thousand feet. But whatimmediately drew Niall's attention was the battlemented wall that ran across theflat plain to the north of the lake. Niall had never seen such a wall. Its colorwas gray-green, like that of the landscape, and it ran from the sea coast to thewest for as far as the eye could see on to the eastern plain. Its surface wassmooth, unbroken by doors or other entrances. In response to Niall's curiosity,Asmak descended until they seemed to be standing on top of the wall, which wasconstructed of rough slabs of stone held together by some kind of cement. It wasflat and about twenty feet wide, with a low parapet on either side. The southernside, Niall observed, sloped down at an angle to its base, while the northernside was a sheer drop of about eighty feet to the plain below. At regularintervals of a few hundred yards there were square towers that rose a dozen feetabove the top of the wall. They were now standing within a few feet of one ofthese, and Niall could see that it was a kind of guardhouse, with a passagewayrunning straight through it. Like the rest of the wall, the structure gave animpression of enormous strength.\"Who built the wall?\"\"I do not know. They say it was there before the coming of the spiders. Perhapsthe men who built that place.\"Niall followed the spider's gaze, and for the first time noticed the buildingshalfway up the great cliff. They were the same gray-blue color as the rock,which is why Niall had not noticed them immediately. There were dozens --perhaps hundreds -- of these buildings, carved out of the solid rock face. Niallexperienced a cold sensation down his spine.\"Could that be the city of the magician?\"But the spider made a gesture of dissent. \"Impossible. It has always beendeserted.\"Niall gazed on the valley for a long time. Even the lake was awe-inspiring. Itssteep sides plunged down to water whose black surface suggested enormous depths.It looked as if the earth had split asunder in some volcanic convulsion, andthen filled with water.\"And where is the place where Skorbo crashed?\"\"Over there, in the Gray Mountains.\" The spider pointed to the mountains to thenorth. At the same time, their perspective changed, so they were looking down onthem from above. This part of the range was far more wild and precipitous thanits southern reaches. Some of the peaks were like needles; others had the flattops of volcanoes. It was a phantasmagoric landscape, quite unlike the mountainlandscape in the desert of North Khaybad, where Niall had spent his childhood.The place that Asmak was now indicating was a high plateau between twosnow-covered peaks; it looked bare and inhospitable, covered with brokenfragments of rock.\"Did he tell you how it happened?\"\"Yes. He said that he was caught in a storm, and that the wind had made him losecontrol.\"Niall stared at the unsheltered landscape. \"What happened to the spiderballoon?\"\"It was torn against the rocks.\"That was easy to understand; some of the rock-shards had edges that looked likerazors.\"But what did he do with the balloon?\"Asmak was evidently troubled by the question. On an open plateau like this, thematerial of a torn spider balloon should have been clearly visible, even from aheight of a thousand feet.\"I cannot recall seeing it.\"As he spoke, Niall realized suddenly that this was not a real plateau that hewas looking at, but merely the image of the plateau in the spider's mind. Helaughed at his own forgetfulness. \"I'm sorry. That was stupid of me.\"But Asmak replied seriously: \"You are right. None of our patrols have reportedseeing the remains of the balloon. But why should Skorbo lie about it?\"\"Perhaps he wasn't lying. Perhaps someone removed the balloon so we wouldn'tknow exactly where he crashed.\"\"The magician?\"\"That seems possible.\"The spider instantly understood the implication. \"You believe that Skorbo was atraitor?\"\"I believe Skorbo may have fallen into the hands of the magician. Did he everexplain what happened to him during the period after he crashed?\"\"He said that he was injured, and took shelter until the storm passed. He didreceive an injury to his right foreleg; I saw it.\"Niall stared at the strange landscape before him -- at the massive wall thatstretched as far as the eye could see in both directions, at the deserted citycarved into the mountainside, and at the mist-covered mountains, with theirsnowy peaks, that vanished into the distance. The city still seemed to him thelikeliest entrance to the kingdom of the magician. The human beings who hadcarved these dwellings out of the solid rock could surely burrow into the earthbeneath.But the spider, who had read Niall's thoughts, made a gesture of dissent. \"Sucha labor could not be completed in a thousand years.\"\"Even for the men who built that wall?\"\"A wall is a simple task. It requires only a sufficient number of slaves. But totear out the heart of a mountain would be a labor of giants.\"His mind was able to convey the full extent of his objection: an image of giantspiders (for this is how Asmak envisaged giants) burrowing into the solid rock,while an army of slaves removed the debris, carrying it to some distant placewhere it would not betray its origin.Niall stared at the lower slopes of the mountain to the west. \"Then where couldit be? You know these mountains better than any other. Is there no place thatcould be the entrance to an underground kingdom?\"\"I know of none.\"For a long time, Niall stared at the twisted, snow-covered landscape, as iftrying to wrest its secret from it. Asmak waited respectfully, prepared toanswer further questions; yet Niall could sense that he felt the quest washopeless. Niall said finally: \"Thank you, commander.\"As he spoke, the spider released his grip on Niall's imagination, and he foundhimself once more standing on the roof of the tower. It was so dark that for a moment Niall had the strange impression that he was insome chilly dungeon. Then he felt the wind against his face, and saw stars inthe blackness overhead. It came as a shock to realize that night had fallen, andthat his strange mental voyage had therefore taken more than an hour. As hismind readjusted to present reality, he realized that his arm, which was restingon the parapet, had become completely dead; when he allowed it to fall to hisside, it began to prickle with pins and needles. Yet the rest of his body feltnormal and comfortable, and even his face, which had been exposed to the wind,was pleasantly warm.The spider noticed his perplexity, but was too polite to ask questions. Niallexplained: \"The wind is cold, yet my body is warm.\"The spider's response -- the equivalent of a puzzled stare -- made Niall realizethat he found the comment baffling. Then the solution dawned on him. The willpower of the spiders meant that they never experienced cold; when thetemperature fell, they merely increased their circulation by an act ofconcentration. And since Niall had been sharing Asmak's consciousness, his ownbody had responded in the same way.As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, Niall saw that Grel was still standing afew feet away, exactly as he had been standing an hour ago, when they hadstepped out on the roof; again, he experienced wonderment at the apparentlyinexhaustible patience of spiders.The night wind was already beginning to chill him. He turned and led the wayback down the stairs.The room in which the men had been working was empty; they had returned to theirhomes. The spider balloon on which they had been working was neatly folded inthe corner of the room. And since there were no chairs, Niall went and sat downon it. He asked Grel: \"Were you with us on the flight?\"For a moment the spider was puzzled; then he grasped Niall's meaning. \"Yes,sire.\"Now he thought about it, it was obvious. There had been no \"flight\"; Asmak hadmerely told him a story, using his telepathic powers to make it seem real. AndGrel had also \"listened\" to the story, as any normal child would.Niall asked: \"Have you ever been in a spider balloon?\"\"Only once, when I was a child. My father took me on a flight over themountains.\" His mind conveyed an image of the mountains to the north.\"If you were searching for the kingdom of the magician, where would you look?\"He was aware that it was a difficult question, and was surprised when the spideranswered without hesitation: \"At the root of the mountains.\"This was an intriguing idea. Niall had been thinking of an entrance through thecrater of some extinct volcano, or perhaps beneath the city carved out of themountainside. He asked: \"Why the root?\"Grel found this too difficult to explain; but his mind conveyed a picture of ariver flowing into the heart of a mountain.Niall turned to Asmak. \"Do you know of any such place?\"\"No, sire. But then, I have never been beyond the great wall. Shall I order ourpatrols to explore further north?\"Niall considered this, then shook his head. \"No. It might warn our enemy that weare looking for him.\"His thoughts returned to the great wall. Who had built it and why? Could it be acoincidence that it was so close to the place where Skorbo's balloon hadcrashed?\"Do you think that the Death Lord would know who built the wall?\"\"No, sire.\"\"But how can you be sure?\"Asmak's reply was conveyed in a single condensed thought, whose richness andcomplexity would have been inexpressible in human language. What Asmak embodied,in that burst of thought-energy, was an insight into the minds of spiders: theirinterest in all living creatures, and their total lack of interest in suchinanimate objects as walls. He made no attempt to disguise the fact that thespiders' interest in living creatures was based on their preoccupation withfood, and their desire to absorb vital energy. Also implied was the admissionthat spiders saw the absorption of life energy as their chief means ofevolution. For human beings, food is merely a chemical substance that keeps themalive; for spiders, it is the source of life itself. All this, and far more, wasconveyed directly into Niall's mind, and it made him aware of the absurd povertyof human language, and of the richness of communication possible betweenspiders.\"But are there none among you who preserve knowledge of the past?\"\"Assuredly. But only of the past of our own race.\"\"But perhaps the great wall is a part of your past.\"\"How so, my lord?\"Niall found himself wishing that he had the skill to convey his own thoughts ina single burst. \"The great wall must have been built by men. Do you agree?\"\"Of course.\"\"But which men? The human beings who lived on Earth in the age before the comingof the spiders had no use for such a wall. They had flying machines that couldcarry them through the air like birds, and weapons that could demolish thestrongest wall into dust.\"\"But were human beings always so skilled in technology?\"\"No. The men of the ancient past built many great walls. But those walls are nowruins. This wall looks as if it has been built more recently.\"The spider said with astonishment: \"The human mind is amazingly subtle.\"The remark made Niall aware once more of the curious limitations of the spidermind: that for all its shrewdness and sagacity, it lacked the power of logicalinduction.\"Who are these spiders who are versed in the history of your race?\"\"The great ones of the past: Cheb the Mighty, Qisib the Wise, Greeb the Subtle,Kasib the Warrior. . .\"\"But among the living?\"There was a pause, as if Asmak was searching for the right words. He saidfinally: \"Their knowledge lives on.\"\"But how can I share this knowledge?\"\"By entering its presence.\"Niall was baffled. \"But how?\"The question seemed to cause the spider some difficulty, as if he failed tograsp Niall's meaning. \"You wish to do this now, sire?\"Niall said hesitantly: \"If it is permitted.\"Asmak answered: \"You are the lord of this city. To you all things arepermitted.\"\"Then I would like to speak with these spiders who know the history of yourrace.\"Asmak made a semi-obeisance, symbolic of acquiescence. Then he turned toward thedoor, gesturing for Niall to follow.As they descended the stairs to the hallway, Niall experienced misgivings. Hehad a suspicion that his simple inquiry had given rise to some misunderstanding,whose nature escaped him. Yet there was something about Asmak's manner thataroused intense curiosity. His perplexity increased when, instead of crossingthe flagstones to the main door, Asmak turned to the right and descended afurther flight of stairs. Niall found himself in total darkness, and had toplace a hand on the wall to recover his bearings. A moment later, as the stairsmade a right-angle turn, he tripped and stumbled; it was Grel who saved him fromfalling by hooking a foreleg around his waist. Asmak immediately recognized hisdifficulty, and extended assistance. The darkness seemed to vanish, to bereplaced by a soft luminescence which enabled Niall to see the walls and thestairway. It took several moments for him to realize that he was still incomplete darkness, and that the spider was simply conveying a kind of mentalpicture of their surroundings, exactly as on the \"flight\" over the mountains.Niall had expected to be led into some kind of cellar or underground vault;instead, he found himself turning more right-angle bends and descending furtherflights of stairs. When they finally reached level ground, Niall calculated thatthey must be as far below the roadway as the roof of the tower was above it.The corridor in which he found himself was about six feet wide and seven feethigh; its ceiling was curved, and, like the walls, was made of irregular stonesset in cement. Asmak's height meant that he had to walk with his belly lowered,to avoid striking his head on the ceiling; from this, Niall deduced that thetunnel had not been built by spiders, or for them.A dozen yards ahead, the corridor was blocked by a massive door, whose timberswere held together by wrought-iron bands. As they approached, there were soundsof bolts being withdrawn; then the door swung open to reveal a brown wolfspider, who immediately prostrated himself at Asmak's feet. There was some kindof interchange -- spiders were always punctilious in greeting one another --then the wolf spider withdrew into an alcove in the wall, leaving them room topass. For a moment Niall felt sorry for him, standing guard for hour after hourin this cold darkness -- until he recalled that all the spiders in this citywere bound together in a kind of mutual awareness, and that therefore no spiderwas ever completely alone. It was the human beings who deserved pity.The air was damp, and had a smell of mildew; it was also extremely cold,although Niall experienced no discomfort -- his contact with the spider's mindensured that his body remained pleasantly warm, as if he had been takingvigorous exercise on a winter's day.It also ensured that, although the spider's body would normally have blocked hisview along the tunnel, he was able to \"see\" for a considerable distance beyondit. He was impressed by the fact that Asmak must have been familiar withliterally every inch of their surroundings, for his mind reflected them asliterally as if he had been able to see them. There were places where the wallshad fallen into a state of disrepair, and slabs of stone lay on the ground. Inanother place, the ceiling had started to collapse and had been supported bybalks of timber, including a beam that lay across the floor holding the uprightsin place. Asmak skirted such obstacles without the slightest hesitation. At onepoint, the corridor was crossed by a lower tunnel with a downhill slope, and theground there was covered with a slimy liquid with an unpleasant smell ofstagnation; Asmak's warning of the slippery surface caused him to treadcautiously, and enabled him to avoid a fall.So far, Niall had shared the spider's mental states in the sense of being anonlooker. His awareness of what was being communicated by Asmak was more directthan listening to a human voice, yet essentially of the same nature. But now, ashe allowed himself to relax, he found that his own consciousness was beginningto blend with Asmak's, so that it was difficult to tell where his own began andAsmak's ended. It was an extraordinary sensation. To begin with, Asmak'sconsciousness was so much \"stronger\" than his own that it made him acutely awareof the inadequacies of the human mind. He was reminded of the state he achievedwhen using the thought mirror, which amplified the will. But the thought mirrorwas tiring; it left him physically drained. Spider consciousness had atremendous, unflagging power which somehow renewed itself through its own sheerenthusiasm and interest in the world. Yet although Niall found this marvelouslyexhilarating, he was not entirely happy about it. There was something crude andpractical about this spider consciousness; it failed to satisfy some deep hungerfor subtlety and complexity. . .He was aroused from these reflections by the realization that they were nolonger walking along a man-made tunnel. It had widened, and the walls on eitherside of him were made of a white rocklike material that might have been chalk orlimestone. The ground underfoot was irregular, although there were many placeswhere it had obviously been leveled with tools. A hundred yards further on, thetunnel widened again, and they were in a wide gallery whose roof was supportedby irregular pillars of the white rock. It was obvious to Niall that this hadbeen carved by water in some remote geological era. Shallow pools of water stillcovered the irregular floor; they waded through one that was ankle-deep, and thewater was icy. Drops of water fell from the ceiling, and the sound was unusuallyloud in the stillness.They had been walking for almost half an hour, and had probably covered adistance of more than two miles. Niall found himself wondering which directionthey had taken; his question was \"overheard\" by the spider, who immediately madehim aware that they were walking due east. As far as Niall could calculate, thatplaced them somewhere beneath the \"industrial estate\" to the east of the mainsquare.Ten minutes later, he became aware of another sound, like a distant rumble. Asit grew louder, he realized that it was the sound of rushing water. And in spiteof his sense of heightened vitality, he found it hard to suppress a risingnervous tension. This was not due to any lack of trust in Asmak's guidance, butmerely to an instinctive fear of unknown perils. It cost a genuine effort toassure himself that Asmak would not allow any harm to befall him.Moments later, the rushing sound filled the air like a tempest, and they came toa halt on the bank of a wide river. The black water was flowing very fast, butso smoothly that only a few ripples on its surface betrayed its speed. Niall wasrelieved to see that it was spanned by a metal bridge with a railing on eitherside; as they walked across this, the water flowed only a few inches below theirfeet. In the center of the bridge -- which was made of welded metal plates --the noise was deafening; Niall's impression was that the river plunged over awaterfall, perhaps another quarter of a mile downstream. Asmak, he noticed, wasalso nervous; like all death spiders, he had a natural dislike of water.On the far side of the river, the nature of the terrain changed; the white rockwas replaced by a dark, granitelike substance. They were no longer walking alonga tunnel, but along some kind of cleft in the rock; Niall surmised that it hadbeen caused by an earthquake or volcanic eruption, and again the thought madehim irrationally nervous. The ground sloped toward the left, and it wasnecessary to walk carefully to avoid slipping. This \"road\" twisted and turnedbetween sheer rock faces. The sound of water was soon left behind them, and theywere once again walking in a silence in which Niall's footsteps sounded eerilyloud. (The spiders walked as softly as cats.)He could now recognize in Asmak a sense of anticipation that told him that theywere drawing close to their goal. He could easily have learned the nature ofthis goal by seeking access to a deeper level of Asmak's consciousness; but hesensed that the spider would regard such uncontrolled curiosity with a certaindisapproval.The rock faces on either side now came closer together, and finally joinedoverhead to form a pointed arch. The rocky path underfoot had obviously beenleveled, but the sheer hardness of the rock had frustrated all efforts to makeit smooth, and Niall had to tread carefully to avoid twisting his ankle. Greland Asmak had no such problem; the number of their legs made it virtuallyimpossible for them to stumble. But as the tunnel became narrower and lower,both had to bend their legs, so that their bellies were close to the ground. Apoint came where the walls were scarcely a yard apart, and Niall had to bend hishead to avoid striking it on the roof. Asmak had to walk very slowly to squeezehis considerable bulk between the walls. Then, just as Niall was beginning tofeel claustrophobic, the tunnel widened suddenly and came to an end.He found himself standing in a large cave, whose roof was perhaps fifty feetabove them. As far as he could see, there was no other way out; the cave wasvirtually a cul-de-sac. But he was aware of its size only because he was\"seeing\" it through Asmak's mind; like the lair of the Death Lord, it was sofull of cobwebs that even the most powerful light could not have pierced itsdepths. Cobwebs stretched like vast curtains from the walls to the floor;others, with strands like thick rope, stretched across the ceiling. But thesewere not the casually arranged cobwebs that formed a network above most of thestreets of the spider city; Niall sensed immediately that they had been createdby an artistic intelligence of a high order, and that their strange symmetry hadsome profound meaning for the spider mind. Unlike the dust-covered cobwebs inthe headquarters of the Death Lord, these looked new and sticky; they evencarried the faint, distinctive smell -- not unlike some vegetable gum -- offresh cobwebs. This place, he realized, was a kind of spider cathedral, a placeof worship, and the cobwebs were its woven tapestries, constantly renewed as anact of homage.Slight sounds from overhead made him aware that spiders were lurking there.Although the cave was in total darkness, Asmak's familiarity with its geography,and his telepathic awareness of other spiders, created an illusion of a kind ofgray twilight in which everything was clearly visible. He was able to sense thatthe spiders were all young -- some even younger than Grel -- and that there wereabout a dozen of them. Their youth was obvious because they were transmittinginvoluntary signals of excitement at the interruption of their lonely vigil; anolder spider would have learned to restrain these signals. It was also clear toNiall that they were intensely curious about his own presence.Asmak stood there silently for several minutes, waiting for this buzz ofexcitement to die down. Spiders always took their time in greeting one another-- it was a point of honor as well as a natural instinct. During this time,Niall's mind was able to explore the recesses of the cave. Running up the farwall he could see a kind of ascending ramp, not unlike a flight of steps, whichhad obviously been carved out of the rock. This suggested that human beingssometimes made use of this cave -- for spiders, in spite of their weight, wouldhave no difficulty scaling its uneven walls. He was also able to perceive anumber of deep recesses in the walls, all at floor level, although theseappeared to be empty. Since these were all of the same size, and at regularintervals, it was clear that they had been carved by human workmen.Niall was puzzled. He had been expecting to meet some older spider who might beable to answer his questions about the great wall. In fact, it was obvious thatnone of the spiders present had passed beyond the age which in human beingswould be regarded as puberty.Asmak finally spoke. The message he transmitted was a formal one of greeting;after a decent interval, it was answered by the young spiders speaking inunison. This proceeding had the effect of finally blocking off the signals ofcuriosity that were still being transmitted by the younger spiders.Asmak's greeting, and the answer of the young spiders, had been an instantaneoustelepathic signal, whose human equivalent would have been a bow or a handshake.Now Asmak deliberately spoke in human language -- that is, in the type of signalthat spiders used to communicate with human beings.\"The person I have brought with me is an honorary spider.\" Asmak said \"person\"rather than \"human being\" because among spiders, \"human being\" was a term ofcontempt -- like \"pig\" among humans. \"He is also the lord of our city.\" Thisstatement caused a buzz of astonishment among the young spiders, and Niallinferred from it that they knew nothing of what had taken place in the past sixmonths. This in turn implied that these young spiders had been living in thiscold darkness since the days of slavery. Were they being punished? Or perhapstrained for some kind of priesthood? The latter seemed perhaps the most likely.Asmak resumed: \"He is also the chosen one of the great goddess, and thereforeour master.\"For a few seconds there was total silence, unbroken by even a quiver ofastonishment. Then Niall heard the rustling sound of soft, furry bodiesdescending on strands of web. A moment later he was surrounded by spiders whohad lowered their stomachs to the ground in a gesture of homage. He stood there,feeling awkward and embarrassed, yet realizing that this was an essential partof spider ritual, and that he would be showing discourtesy if he allowed theslightest hint of his embarrassment to become apparent. As the momentslengthened, he realized that they were awaiting some gesture on his part. Hetherefore said aloud: \"Greetings,\" accompanying it with a courteous gesture ofacknowledgment. The ritual reply -- \"Greetings, lord\" -- came back like an echo;it was followed immediately by the rustling sound of spiders reabsorbing theirstrands of silk, and ascending once more into their webs. As this happened,Niall felt his body pierced by a pleasant glow, as warm and delicious as aspring breeze, and realized that the young spiders were transmitting a messageof respect and affection. His sense of awkwardness vanished, and was replaced byan answering warmth and affection. It was as if some barrier inside him hadbroken down, and he could accept for the first time that he was truly an\"honorary spider.\"Asmak spoke again. \"Do any of you know the history of the great wall across theValley of the Dead?\"Niall was astonished by the question. How could these young spiders knowanything of the ancient history of their race? In fact, the silence that greetedthe question seemed to indicate that they found it baffling. But after a longpause, a voice replied from above him in the darkness.\"I think it may have been built in the reign of Cheb the Mighty.\"Asmak said: \"Very well. Let us consult him. Are you his preserver?\"A voice from another part of the hall answered: \"No, lord, I am.\"\"Good. Take us into his presence.\"Niall was baffled; his sensitivity to the aura of living creatures made himcertain that this place contained none apart from themselves.There was a soft rustle as a young spider descended to the ground. As he madethe ritual obeisance before him, Niall realized that he was little more than achild -- the equivalent of a human seven-year-old. He was so young that hispoison fangs had not even begun to develop. He spoke to Niall haltingly, as onewho was unused to human speech.\"Please, follow me, sire.\"He led him toward one of the recesses that Niall had already observed. Asmakstood aside to allow Niall to pass, then followed behind. Grel, Niall observed,remained where he was. The young spider's mind took control of Niall's feet -- agesture of courtesy -- steering him skillfully between thick strands of web thatanchored overhead cobwebs to the floor. The recess itself was guarded by acurtain of webs that was virtually a miniature labyrinth. When they had steeredtheir way between its overlapping sheets, Niall found himself standing in theentrance to a cave that extended back about twenty feet. To Niall's surprise, itseemed to be empty. Then, as they advanced toward its end, he realized that itturned a corner. Here the passage narrowed, and the ceiling became lower.Another turn brought them into a low-roofed chamber, not more than a dozen feetwide. Its walls were roughly carved, and glistened with moisture. Against thefarther wall there was a low stone altar on which some roughly spherical objectwas lying. A young spider was crouched in front of it, his legs bunched underhis body. For a moment, Niall assumed that this was the spider who might answerhis question; then, as he rose to his feet, Niall realized that the spider was amere child.They approached the center of the chamber and halted. For a moment Niall foundhimself in complete darkness, as his guide abandoned telepathic contact; amoment later, the contact was renewed as Asmak entered the chamber. In thatmoment, Niall realized with a shock that the spherical object lying on the altarwas the shriveled remains of a dead spider. It was lying on a kind of cushionmade of tangled spider web; its withered legs looked like broken stalks, whilethe leathery body was devoid of the usual hairs, and was cracked and shiny withage, like brittle leather.Asmak said: \"You are in the presence of Cheb the Mighty.\" He lowered himself tothe ground and, after a moment of indecision, Niall did the same. Niall was in a state of bewilderment; he found it incredible that the greatSpider Lord should be so small. According to legend, Cheb was a hundred-eyedmonster who could bite a man in half with his enormous chelicerae. In fact, hewas hardly larger than a domestic cat; even with his legs fully extended, hecould hardly have stood more than three feet high.After a few moments Asmak straightened up again and Niall did the same. He wasfascinated by the sight of the Spider Lord. As a child, he had often shudderedwhen his grandfather, Jomar, told him stories about Cheb's cruelty and ferocity-- on one occasion he was said to have ordered the piecemeal execution of athousand human beings, who were injected with spider venom to paralyze them, andthen eaten over the course of several days. On another occasion Cheb hadpersonally decapitated a hundred prisoners with his pincers. It was obvious thatthis story, at least, was untrue; Cheb's infolded pincers looked scarcely morethan two inches long.Asmak said: \"Do you wish to speak directly to the Great One? Or do you wish meto speak on your behalf?\"Niall looked at him with amazement. \"But how. . .\" He had to make an effort notto stammer. \"But surely the Great One is dead?\"\"No, lord, he is not dead. Neither is he alive.\"Niall stared at the mummified shell on the altar. \"Not dead or alive? Surelythat is impossible?\"In answer, Asmak conveyed another of those compressed bursts of information,which presented itself to Niall's mind as a kind of pictograph. Its content wasso astonishing that Niall had to allow it to unfold slowly in order to absorbit. Asmak, it seemed, was being strictly accurate in saying that the Lord Chebwas neither alive nor dead. It was true that his body had been dead for manycenturies; so had much of his brain. But the parts of the brain that storedinformation had been kept alive, so that Cheb's memory remained available to hisown race, a kind of library preserved in the mummified shell of the body.Keeping his memory cells alive was a task assigned to young spiders; theyprevented him from dying simply by feeding him with their own vital power. Thiswas the explanation of the curious glow of warmth that Niall had experienced inthe presence of the young spiders -- a glow whose nature combined respect andlove. It was with this same living force that the spiders prevented Cheb's brainfrom dying.Now, as Niall watched, the young spider reached into the brain of the MightyCheb, and poured forth a current of living energy. For the first time in hislife, Niall understood a vital truth concerning the nature of love. He hadalways made the natural assumption that it was a mutually shared emotion. Now herecognized it as a vital force which existed in its own right, and which couldbe conveyed directly from one being to another in the form of a flow oflife-energy.What he found difficult to accept was that the shriveled corpse was in somesense alive. Niall's own telepathic sensitivity, amplified by the power ofAsmak's mind, was unable to detect the slightest sign of life; the Lord Chebmight have been a piece of dead wood. The living current that flowed from theyoung spider was simply being absorbed, like water flowing into dry sand. Whatastonished Niall was that a spider who was obviously no more than a child wasable to sustain such a stream of energy. Then, as he became more attuned to whatwas happening, he realized that the young spider was not alone in his efforts;he was a channel for the vital force of all the spiders gathered together in thecave. His task was to canalize and direct it, like a gardener directing thestream from a hose.As Niall watched, the mummified body seemed to glow and expand; moments later,the stream of energy was literally rebounding, filling the narrow space of thecave with an unutterably joyous sense of springlike vitality -- a sensation thatreminded him of the shimmering energy he had experienced among the plants andbushes near Skorbo's warehouse. Moments later, Niall realized that the MightyCheb was becoming aware of his surroundings. He almost expected to see him stirand stretch his legs, and the thought caused a momentary shock of alarm -- forthe shriveled shell was obviously too frail to move without falling apart. Itwas a relief to realize, a moment later, that the body remained as dead as ithad been five minutes ago. Only the mind was alive, and was contemplating itssurroundings with curiosity, like someone who has awakened from a deep sleep.Almost immediately, he became aware of Niall's presence. \"Who is this?\"Asmak answered: \"He is the chosen emissary of the great goddess.\"The Lord Cheb surveyed Niall with a kind of cold curiosity, which reminded Niallof his first meeting with the present Death Lord.\"Is this true?\"Six months ago, that question would have filled Niall with nervous misgivings.But in that time, he had become accustomed to the respect and obedience of thespiders. Now he replied indifferently: \"They tell me so.\"\"You seem little more than a child.\"This seemed to require no reply, so Niall merely stood silently.What had happened in this brief exchange was complex and yet strangely simple.Cheb had known human beings only as enemies or as slaves; therefore, he hadnever met anyone like Niall, who faced him without reverence or fear, and whoseemed indifferent to whether he was believed or not. Moreover, Niall faced himas an equal, possibly a superior. Until Cheb addressed him, Niall had seen himthrough the eyes of Asmak and the other spiders, and shared their sense ofreverence. But the moment Cheb spoke, Niall entered his consciousness. It waslike looking another man in the eyes, and immediately assessing his character.Cheb's character was that of a ruler whose major traits are strength and cunning-- the cunning of one who has achieved power and intends to keep it. Comparedwith Asmak or Dravig, his mind lacked subtlety; he certainly lacked theirintelligence. Yet he emanated a sense of potency; even his \"voice\" was masculineand dominant. Niall could understand why he was known as Cheb the Mighty. In hiscoarse way, he was the most powerful spider Niall had ever met.It was plain that Cheb found this human alien puzzling. He was aware of Niall'sintelligence, and accorded it a reluctant admiration. Yet he was also aware ofNiall's immaturity and inexperience -- that if they had been face to face in thedays when Cheb was alive, Niall would have been easy to outmaneuver. Therefore,the admiration was tinged with a patronizing disrespect. This shocked Asmak; andCheb, in turn, was amused by Asmak's dismay. There was a sense, therefore, inwhich Niall and Cheb the Mighty met as equals, while the others were mereonlookers.Cheb asked: \"Why have you come here?\"\"To ask you a question.\"\"Very well. Ask it.\"\"I want to know who built the great wall across the Valley of the Dead.\"\"I do not know. It was after my time.\"This was a disappointment; and Niall could sense that Asmak was I alsodisappointed.Cheb asked: \"Is that all?\"\"No. I have one more question.\"\"Ask it.\"\"Is it true that you were the first spider to understand the secrets of thehuman soul?\"There was a silence, then Cheb asked: \"Who told you that story?\"\"My grandfather.\" And since it was obvious that Cheb was waiting for furtherinformation, Niall went on: \"He told me that a prince called Hallat had fallenin love with a maiden named Turool. But she was in love with a poor chieftainnamed Basat. The prince tried to kidnap her from Basat's camp, but a dogbetrayed his presence by barking, and he was driven away. So -- according to mygrandfather -- Hallat came to you, and offered to betray the secrets of thehuman soul in exchange for Turool. He taught you how to read the minds of humanbeings, and in exchange, your warriors descended on the camp of Basat, andcaptured it in a surprise attack by night. Prince Hallat executed Basat bystriking off his head. But Turool became insane with grief, and sacrificed herlife by attacking a spider, who killed her.\"As he was speaking, Niall was aware that Cheb was listening with totalattention. And so, he realized a moment later, were Asmak and the young spider.Since it was obvious that they wanted him to go on, and since Niall had heardthe story so often that he knew it by heart, he continued: \"At this time,according to my grandfather, the spiders were already living in this city, andwere curious to learn the secret of the white tower. You offered to make Hallatthe king of all men on Earth if he would help you to penetrate the secret of thetower. He agreed, and had many prisoners tortured to force them to reveal whatthey knew. Finally, an old woman agreed to tell him the answer to the riddle ifhe would spare her husband's life. She told him that the secret of the tower wasa 'mind lock' -- the mind of man must interact with the walls of the tower,which would then dissolve away like smoke. This could be done with the aid of amagic rod. The old woman's husband possessed such a rod, for it was a symbol ofhis power as a chief. Hallat took it from him, and went to the tower the nextday at dawn -- for the old woman told him that the rays of the rising sun wouldfall on a secret door at the foot of the tower. But when Hallat tried toapproach the tower with the magic rod, some force threw him to the ground. Hetried again, and the same thing happened. The third time, he stretched out botharms and shouted: 'I command you to open!' But when he tried to touch it withthe magic rod, there was a flash like lightning, and Hallat was burned to apiece of black charcoal.\"At this point Niall paused, having decided to tactfully omit the last lines ofthe story. But Cheb was obviously aware that there was more to come, and hismanner made it clear that he was still waiting. Niall suppressed hisembarrassment and went on: \"When you heard what had happened, you had all theprisoners executed, including the old chief and his wife. And the mystery of thewhite tower remained unsolved.\" This time, Niall's manner made it clear that thestory had come to an end. Yet the spiders remained silent for a long time.Finally, Cheb made a gesture that was amazingly like a human being shaking hishead. Then he said: \"You speak with the tongue of a sheevad.\"\"A sheevad?\" It was the first time Niall had heard the expression.Asmak explained: \"A sheevad is one who speaks words of wisdom, like the LordDravig.\"Niall was flattered but puzzled; as far as he could see, there was nothingparticularly wise about his story. Then something about the attitude of theyoung spider brought a glimmer of understanding. He had been listening with theabsorption of a child listening to a fairy tale. Niall was suddenly struck bythe realization that the art of storytelling must be totally new to the spiders.When they \"spoke\" to one another, they did so in images which transmitted theirmeaning instantaneously. This meant, in turn, that there could be no \"suspense\";the whole story, with its beginning and end, was transmitted in a single flashof information. When Cheb spoke of wisdom, he meant something more like \"mindcontrol,\" the ability to unfold an ordered sequence of images. It was startlingto realize that human language, for all its inbuilt limitations, struck thespiders, in some respects, as superior to their own method of communication.Since Cheb was apparently absorbed in his own reflections, Niall cleared histhroat and asked: \"Is the story true?\"\"True?\" The Spider Lord seemed taken aback by the question. \"Did Prince Hallatreally exist?\"\"A human being called Hallat certainly existed. But he was not a prince. He wasa slave -- my slave.\"\"And did he teach you to understand the human soul?\"\"No. But he taught me to understand human language.\"\"And how did that come about?\"In asking such questions, Niall did not attempt to formulate them in words. Forexample, in asking if Hallat existed, he merely transmitted an image of Hallatwith a general sense of interrogation. To ask how this came about, it was merelynecessary to transmit a kind of question mark. Compared with spoken words, themethod was pleasingly economical.Unfortunately, Cheb's answer, couched in the same mode, was equally economical;it came as a bewildering explosion of information that outran Niall's powers ofunderstanding, and left him feeling breathless. Cheb perceived his bewilderment,and in the spider mode -- which he obviously preferred to human language --transmitted the message: \"I am sorry. Let me try again.\"His second attempt was less precipitate. The first image was of a bare, bleaklandscape covered in snow, the next of spiders crouching in caves or ruinedhouses to escape the icy wind. These images were accompanied by a kind ofbackground information -- like the background of a picture -- which Niall couldeither pay attention to or merely absorb as a part of the general effect.Translated into human language, Cheb was saying, in effect: \"When I was born,the world was suffering from a great ice age. Millions of my people died beforethey had reached adulthood. The snow fell day and night, and the wind changedcontinually so that shelter was almost impossible to find. The sky was alwaysdark, and for a period of many years, no one saw the sun.\"All this made it clear that Cheb was speaking of the period immediately afterthe Earth had been brushed by the tail of the comet Opik. Niall had learned of\"the great winter\" during his history lessons in the white tower. In thetwenty-second century of the modern era, the Earth had been threatened withdestruction by a radioactive comet, and most of the human race had left in giantspace transports, to undertake the nine-year voyage -- at half the speed oflight -- to a planet in the star system Alpha Centauri. The settlers christenedthis planet New Earth.In fact, the head of the comet missed the Earth by more than a million miles.But material from its tail fell into the Earth's atmosphere, destroyingnine-tenths of all animal life. And its gravitational field caused aperturbation in the moon's orbit, which in turn caused a violent outbreak ofvolcanic activity on Earth. The atmosphere turned into a kind of fog whichformed an impenetrable barrier against the sunlight. The planet entered a newice age, which continued until the dust particles slowly fell back to earth. Twocenturies after the disaster, the ice fields began to retreat, as other climaticfactors transformed the surface from a refrigerator into a hothouse.The comet which had brought destruction also brought a new form of life. Itoriginated on the planet Alpha-Lyrae 3, the third in the solar system of theblue star called Vega, in the constellation Lyra, twenty-seven light years away.On this planet, the force of gravity was so immense -- a hundred times greaterthan that of Earth -- that a man on its surface would have weighed ten tons andbeen unable to lift his eyelids. Under these conditions, the only intelligentlife form to develop consisted of giant globular creatures, which on Earth wouldhave been called vegetables.A hundred and fifty million years ago, a fragment from an exploding galaxypassed through the Vega system, causing a catastrophic upheaval on Alpha-Lyrae3, and tearing loose a segment almost as large as the Earth. This material wasdragged through space in the wake of the star fragment until, many millions ofyears later, it came into near-collision with the comet Opik -- whose head wasfifty thousand miles in diameter -- and was captured in its tail. This is howthe seeds of the vegetable life form of the planet Alpha-Lyrae 3 came to land onEarth.Some fell in deserts or polar regions and perished. Only five succeeded ingerminating, and one of these was in the tropical region of the Great Delta.Because Earth's gravity was so much lower than that of their own planet, theirmolecular processes were accelerated, and they became immense -- the plant inthe Great Delta, half-buried in the earth, looked like a small mountain.These giant plants possessed highly developed powers of telepathy; on their ownplanet, evolution was a communal effort. On Earth, their evolution soon came toa halt because a mere five superbeings could not build up sufficientthought-pressure. There was only one solution: for the plants to create moresuperbeings by accelerating the evolution of other species. The plants becamegiant transmitters of vital energy, causing the energy to flow through the Earthitself. All creatures who could receive the vibrations began to evolve at anaccelerated rate. Unfortunately, most animals on Earth -- including man -- hadalready evolved too far to be able to receive these vibrations. Insects, on theother hand, seemed highly receptive to these waves of pure vitality, and manyspecies quickly developed into giants. But certain types of spiders were themost receptive of all; this is how they quickly replaced man as the mostdominant species on Earth. Aware that they owed their life to the energytransmitted by the giant plant of the Delta -- men called it the empress plant-- they worshiped it as the great goddess. It was because Niall had spoken withthe goddess face to face that the spiders now revered him as a kind of god.The Mighty Cheb must have been among the earliest of the giant spiders; this iswhy he was so much smaller than his modern descendants.Now Niall asked the question that had always puzzled him, even as a child. \"Butwhy did the spiders become the enemies of men, instead of their friends andallies?\"Cheb answered: \"It was not our choice. During the great winter, many of ourpeople were forced to share habitations with men. When they found us, theykilled us. We would have been glad to live in peace. But long before I was born,men and spiders had been bitter enemies.\"And now, transmitting his images more slowly, Cheb told a story of murder andcruelty that made Niall feel slightly sick. During Cheb's lifetime, the spiderswere already increasing in size and intelligence at an astonishing rate. Oddlyenough, many human beings regarded them with respect, believing that it wasunlucky to kill a spider unnecessarily. But the steady increase in size wasnoted with alarm. With the exception of a few rare species -- such as the blackwidow -- few spiders secreted a venom that could kill human beings, and thevenom of the large and hairy tarantula -- the species to which Cheb belonged --was too weak to kill even a cat or dog. It was unfortunate, therefore, thatduring the great winter, the bite of a hairy tarantula was responsible for thedeath of a sick child, and that the child's brother, a youth named Ivar,thereafter killed every spider he came upon. In due course, Ivar became a greatleader, known among his own people as Ivar the Strong, but to others as Ivar theCruel. It was Ivar who conquered most of his neighbors in the country of the tworivers, and who seized its largest city and massacred its inhabitants. This cityhe renamed Korsh -- meaning stronghold -- and he and his descendants built itsgreat walls and towers with slave labor.The land to the far north of Korsh was a mountainous region, full of deepvalleys, and it was in these valleys that the hairy spiders had establishedtheir own kingdom. They lived on birds and small animals and reptiles. Theirnearest human neighbors had allowed them to live in peace. But when Ivarconquered these neighbors, he learned of the existence of the \"Valley of theSpiders,\" and decided that the hairy tarantulas had to be exterminated. Theentrance to the valley was blocked by webs; these were destroyed by fire. Ivarhad discovered an underground source of a black, tarry substance which burnedfiercely and gave off a poisonous smoke. The spiders, confident that they weresafe in the depths of their caves, made no attempt to resist the invaders; theylearned too late that the black smoke could suffocate them. As spiders tried toflee from the depths of the caves, men waiting above the entrance covered themwith the black tar, while others drove them toward bushes that had been set onfire. The spiders, blinded and half-poisoned by the smoke, were easy prey; byevening, the valley was piled high with their burnt bodies. Because they weretelepathic, the pain and misery of the dying spread panic and madness among theliving. Spiders in other valleys retreated to the north, into a land still inthe grip of winter, and thousands died there. And because of the massacre of thespiders, Ivar became known as Ivar the Strong.So great were Cheb's powers of description that Niall could smell the charredflesh and the choking odor of burning tar; he witnessed the spectacle ofmothers, with their young clinging to their backs, battered to a pulp withwooden clubs, or deliberately burned alive by men who ignited their tar-sprayedbodies with blazing straw. Now, at last, he understood why the death spidersregarded man as the most evil and depraved creature on Earth.Ivar's cruelty led to his downfall. The spiders were already evolving at anaccelerated rate; now their misery and hatred concentrated the powers of thewill. Within a few generations, they had developed a poison strong enough tokill the largest man or horse, and a will power capable of paralyzing a man inhis tracks and preventing him from moving until he had been injected with venom.This was how the spiders became the deadliest creatures on the planet -- out ofa desperate need to prevent their extermination by human beings. Ivar, ofcourse, knew nothing of this -- he had been too busy conquering the lands to theeast. So when he learned -- from shepherds and herdsmen -- that the spiders hadreturned to their valleys, he prepared for another massacre. The webs thatblocked the entrance to the valley were burned, and wood soaked in tar was piledoutside the caves. Ivar himself, on a mighty black horse, prepared to give theorder to ignite the bonfires. His men, holding their blazing torches, awaitedthe signal. But the signal never came. As Ivar began to raise his arm, a look ofsurprise and alarm crossed his face, and he seemed to be struck dumb. And themen who were holding the torches also found that they were unable to move; eventhe strongest could only twitch their limbs and roll their eyes. Then thespiders swarmed out of the caves, while others blocked the entrance to thevalley. Fleeing men -- for many were still able to move -- were overwhelmed byspiders that climbed their backs and sank fangs into their necks. No fires werelit that day. Instead, more than a thousand paralyzed men were dragged intocaves, and their clothes stripped from them by the powerful chelicerae of themale spiders. Then the children drank their warm juices, while the adults gorgedon their living flesh. Ivar the Cruel lasted for three days; his eyelids wereeaten away so that his eyes remained open until the hour of his death. It wassaid that he remained fully conscious until a few minutes before he died.So great was Niall's state of empathy with the Spider Lord that he experiencedno horror at this recital -- rather, a feeling of satisfaction that the humanshad received the punishment they deserved.He asked: \"And were you alive at the time of these events?\"\"No. I was born a thousand moons later.\" (It took Niall a few moments to workout that this was approximately eighty years.) \"That was in the reign of theking called Vaken the Terrible. His warriors hunted and killed our people inorder to obtain their poison, which they used to preserve animals in winter.\"Niall interrupted: \"But if your people had developed the power of the mind,surely they had nothing to fear from human beings?\"\"Unfortunately, that is not so. My people are peace-loving and unsuspicious. Allthey wanted was to be allowed to live without fear. This is why we moved awayfrom the valley of the massacre -- even after our triumph over Ivar the Cruel --and went to live in the valleys of the north. But human beings were full ofdesire for revenge, and they often took us by surprise. The grandson of Ivar theCruel started an avalanche that buried alive thousands of our most courageouswarriors. We retreated to a ruined city between the mountains and the sea,hoping to find safety. But on the night of the strong winds, Skapta the Cunningstarted a fire which swept through the city with the speed of a storm cloud, andagain thousands of my people were burned to death.\"After that came Vaken the Terrible, and he never ceased to persecute us untilmy people were driven to find refuge on the mountainous side of the great river.I was born in these cold lands which are far to the north. I can remember theyear of the icy winds, when many of our people froze to death. When my fatherfailed to return from hunting, I went out to look for him. I found him buried insnow, still standing guard over the carcass of a stag, which had frozen into ablock of ice. And since my father was our ruler, and I was his strongest son, Ibecame Death Ruler in his place.\"It was I who decided that we should leave the lands of the north wind andreturn to the south, even if it meant being killed by human hunters. I was thefirst of our kind to decide that we had to make war if we were to survive. Thatis why I became known as Cheb the Mighty. I led my people back to the city thathad been burned by Skapta the Cunning, and for many years we lived among itsruins, undetected by human beings. I taught my people to be vigilant -- to keepguard so that we could no longer be surprised by enemies. If herdsmen came closeto our city, we hid ourselves until they went away. If they came too close, anddiscovered our presence, we captured and killed them.\"Now my chief adviser was a counselor called Qisib, who was entrusted with thetask of demolishing the dangerous parts of the city. And it was he who realizedthat our human captives could perform these tasks more efficiently than mypeople. They were physically stronger than we were, yet their minds were feebleby comparison. So instead of killing our captives, we began to use them asslaves. Among these was a boy called Hallat, who was as strong as an ox. Oneday, when he was demolishing a building, his guard was killed by a falling beam.He had the opportunity to escape, yet he preferred to remain. That is why Ibegan to trust him, and to treat him with kindness. And it was through Hallatthat I began to understand the ways of men.\"Niall asked: \"And who was Princess Turool?\"\"I do not know. Hallat was allowed to take his pick of female prisoners. But Inever knew their names.\"\"And is it true that he was killed by lightning when he tried to enter the whitetower?\"\"No. Hallat was never in this city, for in those days it was still occupied byhuman beings. But it was through my counselor Qisib that the city finally fellinto our hands. One of Hallat's wives died in childbirth, and the child wasgiven to one of Qisib's daughters. Instead of eating him, she decided to keephim as a pet. And when the child was old enough to walk, some other humanchildren were sent to play with him. Instead of welcoming them, the child rushedat them and tried to bite them. And Qisib, who happened to be in the room,realized that the child did not regard himself as a human being. Because he hadbeen brought up among our people, he regarded himself as a spider.\"It was now that Qisib displayed the wisdom for which he was famous. He orderedthat all human children should be taken away from their mothers when they werenewly born, and brought up by our women. Until the child was old enough to walk,it was not allowed to see another human being. Only then was it taught humanlanguage by our slaves. In this way, Qisib created a class of humans whoregarded their own kind with contempt, and preferred the company of our people.\"When they were old enough, these humans were sent out among the shepherds ofthe wilderness to act as spies. They always told the same story -- that theirparents had been captured by spiders, that they had been brought up as slaves,and had seized the first opportunity to escape. They were welcomed everywhere asheroes. When they came to the city of Korsh, the son of Vaken the Terrible,known as Vaken the Fair, commanded a feast in their honor. Some of them evenmarried maidens from the city. Yet they remained faithful to their task. Andthose who became shepherds and goatherds were able to bring us information aboutthe defenses of the city.\"Finally, the night came when a million of my people surrounded the city ofKorsh. There was no need to launch a surprise attack, for we merely had toparalyze the minds of all its inhabitants. When this was done, the city wasours. The next morning, Vaken the Fair was brought before me, bound hand andfoot with spider web, and I made him pledge his loyalty and swear to be my slavefor the rest of his days. When that was done, my own subjects proclaimed me thefirst Death Lord. And from that day forth, my people were masters of all thelands between the two rivers.\"As he ended his story, the Death Lord lapsed once more into human language,which -- compared to telepathy -- seemed cold and expressionless. This was agesture of politeness, a recognition that Niall's loyalties might be divided;yet nothing could disguise the note of triumph and excitement in Cheb's voice ashe described his greatest victory. And although Niall was aware that thisvictory marked the beginning of human slavery, he still found it impossible notto thrill with sympathy. The spiders had been a subject people; yet in one day,they had displaced man as the lords of the Earth. It was surely one of the mostmomentous days in the history of the planet.Cheb was studying Niall's reactions with interest -- unlike the other spiders,he felt no inhibitions about probing Niall's mind. Now he asked with a kind ofrough humor: \"Well, human, did we not deserve our victory?\"\"Yes, lord, you deserved to live in peace. But there can be no true peace whilethere is slavery.\"The Spider Lord responded with a sound like a grunt. \"Perhaps. But while I wasalive, there was no alternative.\"Niall asked curiously: \"Are you not still alive?\"\"In your sense, no.\" The Death Lord suddenly sounded weary. \"My brain is keptalive by the strength of these children.\" He sent an impulse of affection towardthe young spider, who responded with a movement of gratitude, like a dog beingstroked. \"But now this one is becoming tired, and I must not exhaust himfurther.\"Niall made a formal obeisance. \"I thank you for your courtesy and patience.\"\"The pleasure was mine. Before I go, do you have anything further to ask me?\"Niall was reminded of why he had been brought to this sacred place. \"Only onething, lord. Have you ever heard of a race of humans who live underground, andwhose leader is a great magician?\"\"No. But wait. . .\" The Death Lord paused to reflect. Then he sighed wearily.\"No, I can no longer remember. Speak to my adviser. He knows everything. Now itis time for me to return. Goodbye and safe voyage.\"A moment later, Cheb was gone. He vanished so quickly that Niall was taken bysurprise. His mind, still in contact with the mummified brain, found itselfsuddenly surrounded by emptiness. The sensation was like waking from a deepsleep. It seemed incredible that this long-dead shell had ever contained aliving presence.For several minutes, no one spoke -- spiders were never in a hurry to breaksilence. Finally Asmak said: \"The Great One was in a good humor today.\"His voice sounded oddly hesitant, and it made Niall aware of the momentousnessof what had just taken place. Cheb was a legendary being, almost a god; yet hehad spoken to Niall as to an equal. Asmak was hesitant because he wasoverwhelmed by what he had just witnessed: a dialogue between the Mighty Cheband the emissary of the goddess.Niall asked: \"What did he mean by 'Speak to my adviser'?\"\"The Mighty One was referring to Qisib the Wise.\"\"And is it possible for me to speak to Qisib the Wise?\"It seemed to Niall that Asmak was troubled by this question; for a moment, heeven wondered whether the request would be refused. Then, without replying,Asmak turned and led the way out of the sacred chamber. Their original guidefollowed behind. The young spider remained where he was, obviously in a daze oftotal exhaustion. Now they were back in the sacred cave, Niall became aware of a strange tensionin the atmosphere; it was as if all the spiders were holding their breath. Itwas when he allowed his mind to blend with that of Grel that he understood thereason. Like Asmak, these young servants of the mighty dead felt that they hadbeen privileged to witness an encounter that would be preserved in legend. Niallhimself was feeling oddly relaxed and alive, a feeling that seemed to be apresage of some interesting experience or discovery.As they stood in the center of the floor, three young spiders descended softlyfrom above, and advanced toward them. Niall was surprised to observe that thesewere brown wolf spiders -- they were physically bulkier and more powerful thandeath spiders. Since wolf spiders were generally treated as servants -- andseemed to accept themselves in this role -- Niall was surprised to see them inthis sacred place. He was even more surprised when the three spiders ignoredAsmak, and seemed to consult among themselves. It seemed clear that theypossessed some kind of authority or responsibility. Finally, the largest of thethree -- he was almost full-grown-turned to Asmak and made a mental gesture ofacquiescence. He then led the way across the cave, followed by his twocompanions. Asmak gestured for Niall to precede him. This time, Grel brought upthe rear.Niall expected to be led to another cave whose entrance was concealed by layersof spider web. He was surprised when the spiders halted at the foot of sheerrock face, then proceeded to climb upwards. At close quarters, he saw that therough surface of the rock afforded many hand-and footholds. With only a moment'shesitation, he gripped a small projection a foot above his head, placed hisright foot on an inch-wide ledge near the ground, and hauled himself up. Amoment later he was relieved to feel himself supported by Asmak's will-force,which prevented him from falling backwards while he groped for further holds.When he was about six feet from the ground, he realized that the three wolfspiders had vanished. The mystery was explained a few minutes later when --gasping from the exertion -- he found himself looking into a small circular holein the rock face. It was scarcely more than two feet high, and he was forced toscramble into it headfirst. As he did so, he lost telepathic contact with Asmak,and for a moment experienced a queasy sensation as he found himself in totaldarkness in a passageway so low and narrow that it induced a feeling ofclaustrophobia. A moment later, contact was again resumed, bringing an illusionof sight; but his ability to \"see\" his surroundings brought no comfort. The\"hole\" was man-made -- its sides were covered with the marks of tools -- but wasso narrow that it would have been totally impossible to turn. Moreover, itsloped downward, increasing the sense of claustrophobia by making him feel thatretreat was impossible. A dozen or so yards ahead, the rear of the young wolfspider was disappearing around a corner. In this narrow space, the acrid anddistinctive smell of spiders was very strong.If Asmak observed his alarm, he was too tactful to show it. When he had squeezedhis own large bulk through the entrance, the passageway was effectively blocked,and Niall felt as if he was immured in a kind of rocky coffin. For a briefmoment Niall struggled with panic that made him feel suffocated; then he forcedhimself to crawl on down the passageway, keeping his head low to avoid the roof.A bend in the passage proved difficult to negotiate; it had been made forspiders rather than human beings. For a distance of perhaps ten feet it becameeven more narrow, so that the walls pressed upon his shoulders, and he had topush himself forward with his toes. Then, to his intense relief, it widened, andhe found himself in a small chamber, pressed against the hairy bodies of thewolf spiders, with their oddly distinctive smell. It seemed impossible thatthere could be room for anyone else; but as Asmak pushed his way into thechamber, Niall had to squeeze against the wall, wedged tightly by the armored,crablike legs of one wolf spider and the upper portion of the soft abdomen ofanother.Unlike the tomb of Cheb the Mighty, this tiny chamber, scarcely five feet indiameter and less than six feet high, contained no altar, nor any otherrepository for the body of a dead spider; it seemed to be empty. Then, on theopposite wall, Niall noticed the patch of newly spun cobweb, little more thansix inches in diameter, and realized that it must conceal some kind of hole inthe rock.In this narrow space, the heat of the spiders' bodies was oppressive, and theirdistinctive odor even more so. Yet in the presence of these young spiders, Niallmade a decisive effort to overcome his feelings of oppression and alarm; as therepresentative of the goddess, he felt that it would be shameful to displayweakness.Now Asmak's attention centered upon the cobweb-covered hole in the oppositewall, and Niall became aware that it was no more than a small hollow, scarcelysix inches deep, and that its backward-sloping floor was covered with a cushionymass of cobweb. In the center of this lay all that remained of Qisib the Wise,the spider who, according to legend, was the first to learn how human beingscould be enslaved.Niall had ceased to feel surprise; instead, he merely observed that Qisib wasfar smaller than his master Cheb. By comparison, Cheb was a giant. The body ofQisib was the size of a small bird, and most of the legs upon which it restedhad broken away, so that they looked like withered segments of dry stick. Thecephalic region and the thorax were complete, but the abdomen, which should havebeen the largest portion of its body, was so shriveled that it was almostnonexistent.And now, for the first time, he understood why it had been necessary for threewolf spiders to accompany them. Qisib the Wise was in such a state ofdissolution that he was scarcely more than a few mummified fragments. It washardly surprising that Asmak had been troubled by Niall's request to speak tohim -- it seemed inconceivable that even the vital force of three healthy youngwolf spiders could restore this dehydrated shell to some semblance of life andintelligence.The moment the three wolf spiders began to concentrate their attention on thefragments of the corpse, Niall's sense of claustrophobia vanished; he was sototally absorbed in what was happening that his present situation wasunimportant. This time, he allowed himself to become identified with the unifiedawareness of the spiders; like them, he entered into the shell of Qisib theWise, and drifted into a kind of gray emptiness as his mind groped for afoothold in the world of nonexistence. What amazed him was that the wolf spidersseemed in no way discouraged by this emptiness; their vitality poured into itlike water pouring over some bottomless waterfall. For a moment he was grippedby a feeling of loneliness that was close to panic, as his own mind threatenedto dissolve into the void. Then he became aware that the grayness was no longera featureless nothing; some kind of life was erupting to the surface, like anexpanding pattern of ripples. It was like a monster rising from the bottom ofthe sea. The sense of erupting energy was due to its attempt to awaken itselffrom nonexistence. For a moment, it seemed doubtful that the energy of thespiders would suffice, and that they themselves would be dragged down intononexistence. Then, like a sleeper opening his eyelids, the consciousness ofQisib the Wise began to take its bearings, and to struggle for a foothold in theworld of the living. Oddly enough, it seemed intensely reluctant to do this, asif to be alive was an unutterable burden.The difference between Qisib and Cheb was immediately apparent. Cheb had treatedhis excursion to the world of the living as a kind of holiday; for Qisib it wasa wearisome duty that he would have been glad to escape. Like a sleeper rousedfrom a heavy slumber, he was anxious to sink back into oblivion. And at thispoint, Niall realized why wolf spiders had been chosen rather than deathspiders. They were less intelligent than death spiders, but their mindspossessed the kind of brute force to prevent Qisib from escaping back into thegrayness.What happened next took Niall by surprise. It was exactly as if one of the youngspiders had seized Qisib in his powerful front legs and dragged him across thethreshold of the living world. What happened, in fact, was that the spidertransferred Qisib's consciousness into his own brain, then retreated into a kindof trance, leaving Qisib in possession. The dead spider had ceased to be adisembodied mind, and became part of a living entity, supported by his lifesystem. For a moment, he remained passive, as if still unwilling to make anykind of effort. Then he turned his attention to Asmak, and asked wearily: \"Whatis it this time, guardian of the dead?\"The voice, unlike that of the Lord Cheb, was thin and without resonance. Niallhad observed before that the \"voices\" of spiders were as distinctive as those ofhumans, even though the communication was from mind to mind. They were clearlyan expression of the spider's whole personality.Asmak said: \"This youth is the emissary of the great goddess. He wants to askyou a question.\"Qisib surveyed Niall without interest. \"Let him ask it.\"The voice was bored and flat.Niall said: \"I want to ask, lord, whether you know who built the great wallacross the Valley of the Dead.\"\"Yes. I did.\"\"You!\" Niall was aware that Asmak and Grel (who was standing behind him in thecorridor) shared his astonishment.\"That is so. I don't mean on my own, of course.\" Qisib sounded slightlydefensive. \"I mean I supervised the work.\"\"And that was after the time of Cheb the Mighty?\"\"Yes, that's right. It was in the reign of his son Kasib the Warrior. Although,in fact, I suppose the whole thing started in the time of Cheb.\"Qisib spoke slowly, as if he was ruminating on his words. His voice had none ofthe vigor of Cheb's voice, nor any of his natural authority, and the reedyintonation made him sound very old. Yet there was something oddly likable aboutQisib the Wise, as if he combined modesty with a sense of humor. It was easy tounderstand why he had been chosen by the two great Spider Lords as their chiefcounselor.Niall asked: \"But why was the wall built?\"\"To keep out those human creatures from the north.\" The image Qisib used for\"human creatures\" was vaguely insulting, as if referring to some particularlydisgusting insects.Niall made an effort to repress his excitement. \"Who were they?\"\"I don't know. We never found out.\"He realized that it was going to be difficult getting specific information outof Qisib. It was not that the great counselor was trying to be difficult or wasunwilling to tell what he knew. It was simply that Niall was questioning him inhuman language, and Qisib -- who had obviously had little mental intercoursewith humans -- found it confusing, like a man trying to understand a foreigntongue.Niall drew a deep breath, and reflected on how to phrase his next question.\"The mighty Lord Cheb has described to me how you conquered this city. He saidthat he then became master of all the lands between the two rivers. Yet now youtell me that he failed to conquer the humans from the north.\" Niall paused, butQisib made no reply; it was obvious that he failed to understand what Niall wasasking. Niall tried to clarify: \"What land did these people come from?\"\"I don't know. We never found out.\"\"But didn't you want to find out?\"\"Not in the beginning. We weren't interested in the mountains to the north ofthe Valley of the Dead. They weren't of any use to us, and the coastal plain wastoo narrow.\"And now, at last, Qisib's mind was beginning to convey geographical images,first of the Valley of the Dead, with its black volcanic lake, then of the bleakand precipitous mountains to the north, with their strange, needlelike spires.Niall also observed that these northern mountains were heavily coated with snow;it was clear that, in the time of Qisib the Wise, the land was only justemerging from the grip of the great ice age.Niall was struck by the clarity of the mental image; it seemed even sharper andmore real than his recent view of the same mountains through the mind of Asmak.It seemed incredible that memory -- even the memory of a spider -- could storeany scene in such photographic detail.Now that their minds were in close contact, it suddenly became easier tocommunicate. When Qisib realized that Niall was interested in the mental imageof the northern mountains, he sustained and enlarged it, so Niall could study itin more detail. Niall immediately became aware that the lake in the center ofthe valley had been far larger at the end of the great ice age, and the riversthat flowed from it were more turbulent. The mountain streams that fed the lakewere like cascades of white foam; they had filled it to the brim, so that thesteep sides which Niall had noticed earlier were now hidden below the blacksurface.Niall asked the question that he had been meaning to raise ever since his firstsight of this valley. \"Why is it called the Valley of the Dead?\"\"Because so many of our people died here on the night of the great storm.\"\"How did this come about?\"For answer, Qisib conjured up a vision of torrential rain, followed by an imageof rushing water that seemed to explode across the valley, sweeping awaythousands of spiders who had taken shelter under the southern flank of themountain. The image lasted only a second -- Qisib obviously had no desire toprolong it -- but it left Niall feeling shaken and breathless. He could see thatit had the same effect on the other spiders.\"But what were so many spiders doing in this valley?\"\"They were preparing to march north, to seek out the enemy.\"\"But you told me your people were not interested in the lands to the north.\"\"That is true. But we had to defend ourselves from attack.\"And now Qisib's mind created an image of a coastal city with white houses andtree-lined terraces, and buildings that Niall recognized as old churches. Therewas something oddly familiar about the surrounding plain, and the two domelikemountains that enclosed it. With a stir of excitement, Niall recognized the townof Cibilla that he had seen a couple of hours ago. It had then been a desolationof rubble-filled streets and smoke-blackened houses; yet the mountains in thebackground left no doubt that this was the same place.Then, in a series of unambiguous images, Qisib told the story of the catastrophein the Valley of the Dead.The coastal town of Cibilla had been the one in which Cheb had taken refuge onhis return from the northern wastes. More than a century earlier, it had beenburnt by Skapta the Cunning. Men had never returned there, for the ruins werefull of disgusting slimy creatures. (Niall knew that when a spider dies, itsbody turns into a lower form of life called a squid fungus -- an octopus-likeinvertebrate that was fairly harmless to adults, but which loved to suffocateand consume sleeping children.) The spiders were unafraid of these creatures,for they could be controlled by will-force. So Cheb and his people had lived formany years in the ruined town, unsuspected by Vaken the Terrible, or by his sonVaken the Fair. When wandering shepherds came too close, they were captured andheld as slaves. And this is how Qisib came to understand that he held the key tothe conquest of the human race. Human babies were taken from their parents andbrought up as spiders. And it was this new breed of spider-servants who enabledthe Mighty Cheb to conquer Vaken the Fair, and to become lord of the spidercity.Within forty moons, all the human strongholds had been conquered, and Cheb wasthe undisputed master of the world. The conquest was not an easy one. In spiteof their highly developed will-force, few individual spiders were a match forindividual men. Compared with the spiders of that time, men were giants. Andwhen a fully armed soldier, maddened with drink, charged into battle, he couldkill a dozen spiders before their united will-force paralyzed his sword arm.Even the poison of the spiders was useless against a warrior in protectiveclothing. And since, at this time, men vastly outnumbered the spiders, the warwas long and bloody, and after one major defeat, Cheb even considered returningto the lands of the north. But with the aid of the great goddess, he finallyprevailed, and his kingdom extended from the deserts of Khaybad to the GrayMountains in the north.And when Cheb was in his hundred-and-twentieth year, and his legs were no longerstrong enough to support the weight of his body, he retreated to the sacred cavebeneath his capital city, and there made his entry into the land of theunliving. His son Kasib the Warrior, who had conducted Cheb's last campaignagainst the men of the southern desert, became Death Lord in his place.During the last years of his reign, the coastal town that men called Cibilla wasused by Cheb and his ministers as a summer retreat -- for now that the great iceage was over, the weather was becoming increasingly hot. It had been rebuilt byslaves under the command of Cheb's faithful human servants, and the spiders andtheir servants often shared the same buildings, with the spiders living in theupper stories. The cool sea breezes were welcome in the heat of midsummer. Butas Cheb grew old, he began to dream of his childhood in the cold lands of thenorth. He sent an expedition there, and learned that the ice had now retreated,and that the marshes were full of birds and other wild game. And in the yearafter the death of Cheb, his son Kasib sent some of his human servants, underthe command of Madig, grandson of Hallat, to select a site for a new city.But Madig failed to return, and a search party of spiders and human warriorscould find no trace of him. He had vanished somewhere in the mountains to thenortheast. But Kasib refused to believe that a dozen men could disappear withouttrace, even in the dangerous wastes of Kend, and he sent a second search party,headed by the famous tracker Tubin. Tubin soon picked up their tracks, and theyled him to Madig's last camp site. And a dozen miles from the camp site, hefound a single clue -- a dagger whose handle had been pushed into the dampearth, so that the blade pointed toward the Gray Mountains in the west. Madig'swife identified it as her husband's dagger and said that he always kept itstrapped to the inside of his leg above the left ankle.Tubin concluded that Madig's party had been attacked in the middle of the night,and overpowered without a struggle. Then they had been taken away toward thewest. They must have halted briefly -- perhaps to eat breakfast -- so that Madighad an opportunity to draw the dagger from its sheath above his ankle, and leaveit pointing in the direction of their march. He had driven the handle into theearth, to make sure that whoever found it would know it had been placed theredeliberately, and not dropped by accident.Yet all Tubin's skill could find no further trace of the party. Throughout thatday and the next they marched toward the Gray Mountains, without discoveringeven the remains of an encampment. And in the barren foothills of the GrayMountains, they decided to abandon the search and return home.Kasib concluded that Madig had been attacked by wandering nomads, perhapsfugitive survivors from one of the armies he had conquered. But although spiderballoons searched the wastes of Kend and every habitable valley in the GrayMountains, they found no sign of human habitation.Before that summer came to an end, a guard on the walls of Cibilla sighted alone man, dressed in a gray cloak, stumbling across the plain toward the town.Before the stranger could pass through the gate, he collapsed in a swoon, andlay face downward like a corpse. He was carried to a nearby house and placed ina bed. It was only when the captain of the guard went to look at the strangerthat he recognized him as Madig. The face was so pale and emaciated that helooked like a living death's head.Yet when he regained consciousness, Madig refused to tell his story, declaringthat this was for the ear of the Death Lord alone. By this time, Kasib theWarrior had returned to his capital, and as soon as he was strong enough, Madigwas sent to the spider city under escort. There he was taken immediately intothe presence of the Death Lord. But what passed between them remained a secret,for Qisib and all his fellow counselors were sent from the room. Qisib wasallowed to return when the meeting was over, and he observed that Madig seemedweary and heartsick, while the Death Lord looked grim and thoughtful.By the end of that day, Madig had sickened with a fever, so that he was unableto stand upright. He was lodged in a room at the top of the Death Lord's palace,and even his father -- also called Hallat -- was forbidden to see him. Finally,when Hallat heard that Madig was close to death, he cast himself to the groundbefore the Death Lord and begged to be allowed to take leave of his son. TheDeath Lord granted his request, and allowed him to sit by Madig's death bed. Noone learned what passed between them; but a week after Madig's death, his fatherfollowed him to the grave. Qisib was with him when he died -- for Hallat, likehis own father, was a friend rather than a servant -- and saw that the loss ofhis son had deprived him of the will to live. The last words he spoke to Qisibwere: \"My son has been condemned to death.\"When the Death Lord next returned to Cibilla in the hot season, he found thetown in a state of panic. In the course of a year, thirty more of his humanservants had disappeared. Some had been shepherds who had been tending theirflocks in the foothills. But others had been taken at night from the cityitself; one man had even been kidnapped from his home while his wife and twosons were asleep. The guard had been doubled, and slaves began to build anembankment of earth around the town. And still men continued to disappearwithout trace. What caused so much disquiet was that no one had even caught aglimpse of the kidnappers.It was Qisib who suggested that perhaps the enemy was entering the town from thesea. The Death Lord immediately ordered guards to patrol the shore line. Yet onthat very night, two of the guards disappeared -- one from the embankment, onefrom the seashore. When the Death Lord learned of this latest outrage, he sent ahundred spider balloons to scour the surrounding country, as far as the GrayMountains. But it was Tubin the Tracker, working alone, who found the body ofone of the guards, buried in a shallow grave within a mile of the town. Botharms had been cut off at the elbow, and both legs removed at the knees. This wasthe only body that was ever found.Now the Death Lord fell into a rage and swore revenge. (This, Niall realized,was a considerable admission; unlike men, spiders were ashamed of strongemotion; it was a point of honor never to admit to it.) He called together allhis counselors -- of whom Qisib was the oldest and most respected -- andannounced that he would search out the enemy and destroy him. Overawed by hiswrath -- as well as sharing his anger -- most of them agreed that the enemy mustbe punished at all cost. Only Qisib, and an old general named Amalek, advisedcaution. Qisib felt that an enemy who was so skilled in concealment was moredangerous than the Death Lord realized. But Kasib was so angry that their advicewas ignored.And since everyone agreed that the enemy must be hiding in the Gray Mountains,and since it had always been Kasib's intention to lay claim to all the northernlands, Amalek was ordered to assemble an army of thousands of spiders and humanwarriors. These were gathered on the plain of Cibilla, then marched north to theValley of the Great Lake. The human warriors marched along the coastal plain,while wolf spiders scaled the mountains and searched every valley. (Niall couldimagine the tireless wolf spiders clambering up and down mountains as if theywere hillocks.) Four days later, the army regrouped on the shores of the GreatLake, and prepared to begin the invasion of the northern mountains. The humansoldiers, under Amalek, would march up the western coastal strip; the wolfspiders would once again scour the mountains and valleys; the death spiders,under Kasib the Warrior, would march eastward to the river valley that gaveaccess to the wastes of Kend.On the day before the armies of Kasib prepared to march northward, the weatherwas stifling and humid, without a breath of wind. But in the late afternoon, thesun disappeared behind a great black cloud, and a cold wind sprang up from thesoutheast. By early evening the wind had turned into a gale, and the rain was soheavy that it beat the canvas tents of the foot soldiers to the ground. Kasibgave the order for the army to take shelter under the southern flank of themountains, where a great cliff offered some refuge from the wind. Kasib himself,together with his counselors and commanders, crossed the river on a pontoonbridge built by his engineers, and struggled to the north side of the valley --the wind was now so strong that they had to cling together to avoid being blownaway -- and took shelter in the mysterious city carved into the face of thecliff. There, from inside a deserted palace, they saw the pontoon bridge sweptaway by the torrent. The Death Lord was unconcerned, convinced that the stormwould soon blow itself out. But by midnight, the gale was stronger than ever. Inthe early hours of the morning, they heard the sound that Qisib had feared (fora sixth sense told him that they were on the brink of disaster), the thunder ofwaters as the lake burst its bank. Qisib had already shut his mind to the miserybeing endured by the spiders exposed to the storm, but now he was overwhelmed bytheir anguish as the torrent struck them and smashed them against the rocky wallof the mountain. Within a minute, all had been destroyed; the force of the waterswept the valley clean, leaving behind not a single trace of the mighty armythat had been encamped there.By dawn the next day, the rain and the wind had ceased, but the whole valley hadturned into a brown river that ran toward the sea. The Death Lord and hisretainers were forced to spend another day and night in the deserted city beforethe waters had subsided enough to permit their escape. The sun now blazed downon a deserted wilderness of mud.The Death Lord was in a dangerous situation, and he knew it. Unlike humanbeings, spiders possess little imagination, and are therefore disinclined toexaggerate their problems by brooding on them. Yet it was clear to Kasib that hehad lost most of his army, and that if his human subjects should hear about thisand decide to revolt, the spiders would be annihilated. But then, since therewere no survivors, there was no one who might carry the story back to the earsof men. This is why Kasib the Warrior decided to return to the spider city,claiming a great victory in the north, and keeping silent about the disaster.For months afterwards the bodies of men and spiders were cast up along the coaston the incoming tide; but these bodies were instantly burned by squads ofslaves, to prevent knowledge of the disaster from becoming known among men.The stratagem worked. Men never learned of what had happened in the Valley ofthe Dead, and the Death Lord continued to reign as if he had a million warriorsat his command.But the unknown enemy from the north continued to make incursions into the realmof the Spider Lord, killing shepherds, kidnapping guards, even destroying adeath spider with their arrows. No one ever saw them -- they seemed to possessthe gift of invisibility. This is why, on the advice of his counselor Qisib theWise, the Death Lord decided to build a great wall across the Valley of theDead, a wall that was too high even for humans to scale. It took half a centuryto build and cost the lives of twenty thousand slaves. (In the time of Qisib'ssuccessor, Greeb, it led to a slave revolt that ended in the death of thousandsof spiders and their human servants.) Before it was half-completed, Qisib hadpassed into the realm of the unliving. But from the moment the building began,the incursions ceased, and the Death Lord and his descendants were able to livein peace.The voice of Qisib became silent. Every spider present was deeply moved by hisnarrative. The images of destruction were so vivid that it was as if they hadall been present when the lake burst its banks and destroyed so many liveswithin seconds. None would ever forget the image of the valley on the morningafter the catastrophe, a waste of brown-black mud and pools of standing water.(Qisib's mind had conveyed it exactly as he had seen it, and again Niall wasamazed at the photographic accuracy of detail in the spider imagination.)Suddenly aware once more of his surroundings, Niall realized that the tinychamber had become intolerably hot and stuffy. Yet this seemed unimportantcompared with the significance of the story he had just heard.He made a bow of acknowledgment and thanks, constrained only by the fact that hehad almost no room to move. \"I thank you, my lord. I wish I could persuade youto preserve these stories in writing.\"Qisib was obviously puzzled. \"You mean the use of marks that signify speech?\"\"Yes.\"\"What purpose would that serve? We already communicate without the need forspeech.\"\"Of course. But because you communicate with your minds, you have kept norecords. No spider in this city knows the history of how the great wall came tobe built, or how the armies of Kasib the Warrior were destroyed in the Valley ofthe Dead. Do these things deserve to be forgotten?\"\"But they are not forgotten. They are in my brain. That is why they keep mealive.\"\"And do you want to be kept alive?\"\"No.\" A world of sadness was compressed into the syllable. \"I would prefer to beallowed to remain in the land of the unliving.\"Niall was unable to restrain his curiosity. \"What is it like to be dead?\"\"Unfortunately, I cannot remember. As soon as I enter this world, I lose allmemory of that other realm, like a dreamer who wakes from sleep. But I know,from my reluctance to enter this world, that the one I have left must be verybeautiful.\"\"But would you not like to be allowed to remain there?\"\"No, for I have promised to remain alive, so that my memories shall never belost.\"\"But if your memories were preserved in writing, you would be absolved of yourpromise.\"\"That is impossible.\" Qisib spoke with conviction.\"It is true that writing could not capture the richness of your memories. But itcould duplicate all the essential facts.\" Sensing Qisib's objection, he went onquickly: \"Listen to me. There was a time when human beings did not possesswriting. But they possessed speech, and minstrels and storytellers memorizedaccounts of great deeds, and kept them alive for generation after generation.Then writing was invented, and it became possible to keep records. From thattime on, man was able to know his own history. Now all the known history of thehuman race is contained in the records of the white tower.\"Qisib was impressed. \"That must take many words.\"\"Yes. Every page contains many words. And every book contains many pages. Andevery library contains many books.\" Niall accompanied these words with imagesthat made his meaning clear.Qisib seemed appalled. \"That would be a labor of eternity.\"Niall, unaccustomed to expressing ideas, felt overwhelmed with frustration. \"Youdo not understand. You spiders dislike the idea because you think it soundsboring. You live in the present moment, and find it so interesting that you haveno concern for the past. That is a kind of laziness.\" In terms of spideretiquette, Niall was being appallingly rude; but he was so concerned with whathe had to say that this seemed unimportant. \"Human beings are also lazy, butthere have always been a few among them who were not lazy. It was these men whokept the records of history, and made maps of the stars in the sky, and studiedthe laws of geometry -- all activities that most human beings consider boring.That is how men came to build great cities and to conquer the Earth -- by doingthings that you consider boring. It is only by doing things that they considerboring that men cease to be slaves and learn to become masters.\" As he spoke, hewas despairingly conscious that his words were inadequate, and that no spidercould understand what he was trying to say. It was only when he was finishedthat he realized that all the spiders in the room were listening to him withalmost breathless attention; only then did it dawn upon him that because hespoke with such passionate sincerity, they regarded his words as a message fromthe goddess herself.In the silence that followed, Niall was aware that they were absorbing what hehad said, and reflecting on its meaning. Finally Qisib said: \"It would not beeasy to transcribe my memories in human language.\"\"No. But it would be easier than you think. In the white tower there aremachines that can read the mind. They could store the contents of your memory sothat they would never be lost.\"\"The Death Lord would never grant his permission.\"\"That is unnecessary. I am the lord of this city.\" It embarrassed Niall to makethis assertion, but he felt there was no alternative. \"It is I who decide thesethings.\"Qisib turned an astonished gaze on Asmak. \"Is this true?\"\"Yes, lord. He is the emissary of the goddess and therefore the ruler of thiscity.\"\"And his will can overrule that of the Spider Lord?\"\"Yes, lord.\"Qisib mastered his astonishment; not to have done so would have been consideredunmannerly. He addressed Niall with the formal respect due to one in authority.\"Forgive me, sire. I did not realize who you were.\"Niall replied with a mental gesture signifying that it was unimportant.But Qisib was still troubled. \"My vow to remain alive was made under solemnoath. . .\"Niall interrupted: \"By the authority vested in me by the goddess, I have thepower to absolve you of that vow.\"Qisib considered this in silence. When he spoke again, it was obvious that hehad come to a decision. \"Then you also have the power to absolve me of mypromise about what passed between Madig and Kasib the Warrior.\"Niall asked with surprise: \"You learned the secret, then?\"\"The Death Lord finally spoke of it on the night of the great storm, as wewaited for the dawn in the Valley of the Dead. He was deeply troubled by thedisaster, and needed someone to whom he could unburden his soul. Since I was theonly one to share the secret, I was sworn to silence. But there are no secretsthat may not be revealed to the emissary of the goddess.\"Niall's heart began to beat faster. But he restrained his eagerness and remainedsilent -- to show that he had no desire to force Qisib to speak against hiswill.The account that followed was couched in the language of images and sensations.Since Qisib himself had not been present during the events he described, itlacked the pictorial clarity of his earlier narrative; yet Niall was fascinatedto observe how even this twice-told tale-recounted by Madig to the Death Lord,then by the Death Lord to Qisib -- still possessed the authenticity of directexperience.Qisib described how, sleeping in a sheltered valley in the waste of Kend, Madigand his companions had been attacked in the hour before dawn, and overwhelmedbefore they could defend themselves. They never saw the faces of the attackers,for they were blindfolded, and warned that if they made any attempt to removethem, they would be instantly killed. On the second day their captors carriedout the threat and cut the throat of a man called Rolf the Wheelwright becausethey said he was trying to peep underneath his blindfold.For six days they marched across rough and uneven country, and picked their wayacross marshes that had a stench of decay. Their captors spoke very little, evenamong themselves. At the end of the sixth day, they halted at dusk in a grassyvalley; in the distance Madig could hear a roaring noise like a waterfall or ariver in full spate. The sound was a long way off, but Madig's hearing wasexceptionally keen. The prisoners were then given a sweet-tasting drink and soonafter this, Madig began to feel sleepy. But he had guessed that the drink was adrug and struggled hard to resist its effects. So he was still awake when theircaptors were joined by a band of men who came from the direction of the rushingtorrent. This was the last thing Madig remembered before he was finally overcomeby sleep.When Madig woke up, he was on a kind of stretcher and was being carrieddownhill. The sound of the rushing water was now very close. Soon after this, hesaw daylight under the blindfold, and knew that it must be dawn. A few hourslater their captors gave them a meal, then more of the sweet drink, which sentthem to sleep again. But this time Madig succeeded in spilling half his drinkdown his chest, so he was able to remember something of the next part of thejourney. They embarked on a boat and crossed a lake or a wide river. Then theywere placed in chariots drawn by animals, and they traveled throughout the restof the day. At evening, they were given another meal and more of the sweetdrink. Again Madig tried to spill it; but this time his captors noticed what hewas doing and he was given a brutal beating that left him bruised all over. Hewas not sorry when, after being forced to drink a large goblet of the sweetliquid, he lost consciousness again.He awoke to find himself on a hard bed in a damp prison cell with almost nolight. The blindfold had been removed; but when he tried to question his jailer,he was warned that he would be killed if he opened his mouth again. Since heknew that these men would not hesitate to carry out their threats, he took carefrom then on to behave like a mute.For many days he saw no one but the surly and taciturn man who brought him food.But one day, a girl came into his prison cell, followed by a man carrying abucket of hot water. The man ordered him to undress, then the girl washed himfrom head to foot, and trimmed and combed his hair and beard. Madig guessed fromthese preparations that he was about to be taken before some important dignitary-- probably the ruler himself.After being washed, he was ordered to dress. Then he was blindfolded again andled through echoing stone corridors and out of the jail. Although he could seenothing but a crack of daylight under the blindfold, he could tell that he wasbeing escorted through the streets of a fairly large town or city, for the roadunderfoot was hard and smooth. He was also aware that there were other people inthese streets, for he could hear their footsteps. Yet the strange thing was thatit was all so silent that, although he strained his ears, he could hear no soundof voices. His companions also remained silent and Madig was afraid to open hismouth.Now they mounted a flight of steps, and he heard the creaking of a massive door,and the sound of it closing behind them. They crossed a stone-flagged floor, andhe knew from the echo of his footsteps that they were in a large hallway; afterthat they passed through another great door and into a chamber whose atmospherewas as cold as ice. Madig sensed that his companions had left him and that hewas now in the presence of the ruler of this city. And although Madig was famousfor his bravery, he now found himself overcome by a strange feeling of dread, asif in the presence of a dangerous predator, so that it was hard to control thetrembling of his limbs. Then a soft voice spoke from a place that seemed to bein front of him and above his head -- Madig guessed that the ruler of this citywas seated on a throne at the top of a flight of steps.\"I want you to carry a message to the ruler of the spiders.\" The voice had awhispering, throaty sound, as if there was something wrong with the vocalchords. \"Are you listening?\"\"Yes, lord.\"\"I want you to tell your master that these lands belong to me, and that I shalldestroy anyone who invades them. Repeat that.\"\"I am to tell my master. . .\"\"Lower your voice. I am not deaf.\"\"No, lord.\" Madig was disconcerted; he had seemed to himself to be speaking inhis normal voice. Now he lowered it to little more than a whisper. \"I am to tellmy master that these lands belong to you, and that you will destroy anyone whoinvades them.\"\"Good. You may also tell him that I am a magician, and that I can render thiscity invisible, so that it would serve no purpose to try to find it. Do youunderstand?\"\"Yes, lord. I am sure my master. . .\"\"Now go!\"\"Yes, lord.\" But as he turned to go, the hoarse voice said: \"Wait.\" Madig heardthe soft swish of garments descending toward him, but no sound of footsteps.\"You will also tell your master that I shall hold your companions as hostages,and that unless his answer is satisfactory, they will all die.\"\"Yes, lord.\" Madig's heart sank, for he already knew that Kasib the Warriorwould be enraged by the threat, and that therefore his companions were alreadydoomed. Yet at least he would be free to avenge them. . .But, as if reading his thoughts, the unseen man continued: \"You will also die.My arm is long and I do not release my grip.\"Madig's hand was taken in a hand that was cold and strangely rough -- itreminded him of the hand of a leper, covered with scales of decaying skin. Asthe fingers closed, Madig screamed with pain; the grip was so powerful that hefelt it could have crushed the bones of his hand into powder.Now the unseen man brought his mouth close to Madig's ear. \"One more thing.\" Andas he spoke, Madig realized, with a shock of horror, that although the mouth waswithin an inch of his ear, he could feel no breath. \"Tell your master that if heignores my warning, his people will suffer a catastrophe that will make themassacres of Ivar the Cruel seem insignificant.\" He released Madig's hand.\"Yes, lord.\"\"You have one month -- thirty days. If you return here with a satisfactoryanswer before that time, you and your companions will be spared. If not, youwill all die.\"As the cold hand released his, Madig's senses felt as if they were being suckedfrom him. When he opened his eyes again, the blindfold had been removed, and hewas back in his prison cell. He noticed that his right hand was covered withblood, and that his arm felt cold and numb. Later that evening, after supper, hefell into an exhausted slumber. When he woke up, he was again being carried on astretcher, this time up an irregular slope, and was again blindfolded. In thedistance he could hear the roaring of a river. The glimmer of light thatpenetrated the bottom of the blindfold was fitful, and he guessed that hiscaptors were carrying torches, and that they were again traveling by night.For the next six days he was made to march over rough and difficult terrain, andwas always so exhausted by the end of the day that he slept heavily untilaroused the next morning. He noticed that his companions spoke only in thebriefest of monosyllables, but that for most of time, they were silent.One morning, Madig was awakened by the sun on his face. It seemed to him that hehad been allowed to sleep much longer than usual. He lay there, listening forsome indication that his captors were preparing a meal, but the silence finallyconvinced him that he was alone. He pushed up the blindfold, and saw that he waslying in a wide valley which he recognized -- it would later become known as theValley of the Dead. The sun was high in the sky, and his companions were nowhereto be seen. But they had left a cloth containing food and drink, and thisconvinced him that he was free. It took him two days to make his way back toCibilla.By now, the numbness in his arm had crept into his shoulder, and he wassuffering from a permanent fever. Madig calculated that he had twenty days stillto live. This is why he refused the help of doctors, and insisted on being takento the city of the Death Lord. There he was conducted immediately into thepresence of Kasib the Warrior, where he delivered the message from the unknownenemy. The Death Lord listened silently, and when Madig had finished, questionedhim closely about his period in captivity -- how many days' march lay betweenthe wastes of Kend and the stronghold of the enemy, and how far he had marchedbefore being freed. From these questions, Madig knew that the Death Lord wascontemplating an attack on the realm of the enemy, and that he himself wasdoomed to die. He felt no resentment, for he knew that it was impossible thatthe Death Lord should submit to the threats and insults of a mere human being.Physicians attempted to cure Madig as he lay on his sick bed; but none coulddiscover what was wrong with him. The sensation of paralysis had reached hischest, then began to pass downward toward his feet. The fever made himdelirious, and he talked endlessly of the companions he had left in the hands ofthe enemy. And, exactly as the enemy foretold, he died on the thirtieth day.Hundreds of spider balloons scoured the Gray Mountains from the wastes of Kendto the Lake of Silence, but found no trace of any city or even so much as ashepherd's hut. By that time the first snows of the winter had begun to fall andKasib the Warrior knew that his revenge would have to be delayed until thefollowing summer. And it was precisely one year later that the armies of theDeath Lord were destroyed in the Valley of the Dead, the threat of the unknownenemy was fulfilled.Qisib concluded: \"This was the story told to me by Kasib the Warrior as wewaited for daylight in the Valley of the Dead. He wanted me to reassure him thatthe disaster was not his fault. But for once, I was unable to offer my lord anycomfort.\" He fell into reflective silence, and Niall was also silent,understanding that, even after death, Qisib could still experience grief. Qisibasked finally: \"Well, chosen of the goddess, are your questions answered?\"\"All but one, my lord.\"\"Ask it.\"\"What do you think was the ultimate purpose of this unknown enemy from thenorth?\"Qisib reflected for a long time. It was evident that this was a question he hadnever considered. \"To express his hatred and envy of our people. What else couldit be?\"Niall shook his head; the answer seemed too simple.Qisib observed that he was troubled. \"What is your own explanation?\"\"I do not have one. Yet my reason tells me that there must be one.\"There was a long silence, which was finally broken by Qisib. \"You must teach mypeople to use the powers of reason. We do not think enough.\" He added after apause: \"And now it is too late.\"\"Not too late, my lord.\"\"Too late for me, at any rate. For now I must return to the kingdom of the dead.Before I go, have you anything further to ask me?\"Niall considered this. \"No, lord.\"\"Then I have one more thing to say to you. The land of the unliving is timeless,and the past is as the future. When I saw you, I knew that you would be making adangerous journey, and that you would come close to despair. When that happens,remember that an unbroken spirit is unconquerable.\"\"But. . .\"Even as Niall began to speak, he realized that Qisib had already gone. He hadvanished with the abruptness of a bursting bubble, leaving all Niall's questionssuspended in midair. It was only when Niall observed that the three wolf spiderswere lying on the floor, their legs bunched underneath them in attitudes oftotal exhaustion, that he understood how much living energy had been sucked fromtheir bodies, and why Qisib -- like Cheb -- had vanished so abruptly. He alsoobserved that the room had become strangely cold, and that the damp walls werenow covered with a thin layer of frost and ice.After a silence Asmak asked: \"Shall we return, my lord?\"\"Should we not wait until these three have recovered?\"\"That would take a long time -- perhaps two days.\"\"Then lead the way.\"Asmak turned, and vanished into the cleft in the rock. Niall followed, andrealized with surprise that his claustrophobia had vanished, and that he wasleaving this strange place with regret. The moment Niall found himself back on the solid floor, he became aware thatsomething strange was happening. Asmak was standing silently, as if reluctant tomove, and the atmosphere seemed to be permeated with a peculiar, tinglingquality, as if the air was full of tiny bubbles which burst as they came intocontact with the skin. It was like the spray from some cataract of sheer vitalenergy, or like the ringing of a million tiny bells. Niall had experienced thesensation before, in the city of the bombardier beetles. He knew it wasassociated with the life-giving energies of the empress plant -- the plant thatthe spiders knew as Nuada, goddess of the Great Delta. Every day at dawn, theplant transmitted waves of pure vitality -- the same vitality that had causedthe abnormal development of the spiders and other insect life.But what was now happening was that the young spiders were absorbing theseenergies, and then, by a process of mutual interaction, combining them togetherand then releasing them into the atmosphere of the sacred cave. It was as ifeach individual spider allowed himself to become filled to the brim with a vitalfluid, then emptied this fluid into some communal storage vessel. The storagevessel was the cave itself. In this way, they were able to conserve the livingenergy that was necessary to maintain the memory cells of long-dead spiders likeCheb the Mighty and Kasib the Warrior, and to prevent their spirits from takingup permanent residence in the land of the unliving.Asmak himself was caught in this torrential flow of energy, reduced toimmobility and ecstasy by its tremendous vibrations, which seemed to shake thecave like the notes of some mighty organ. Niall could also sense this energy,but on a far lower level; its vibrational rate was too low to affect humans,except in a state of deep relaxation; so that although he was able to sense itspower, he was unable to respond to it. Yet he recognized that Asmak himself wastoo old to respond with the same total involvement as the young spiders; thedevelopment of his powers of control had alienated him from the voice of thegoddess. Now Niall understood why young spiders had been chosen as the guardiansof the mighty dead; they alone could respond with undivided intensity. Niallenvied them.Now the energies slowly subsided, until they were like a sound receding into thedistance. When it vanished, there was a strange silence, like the silence aftera heavy storm, when the only sound is the intermittent fall of a raindrop. Niallwas leaning back against the wall of the cave, so blissfully relaxed that he hadno desire to move. It would have been pleasant to lie on the hard floor and fallasleep. Yet he was also aware that a part of his being remained detached,craving some higher fulfilment than this dreamlike sense of emotional plenitude.It was Asmak who was the first to stir. As his mind reestablished contact, Niallrealized suddenly that he had been standing in darkness; the intensity of theexperience had made sight superfluous. Now once more he could \"see\" the sacredcave, and sense the presence of the young spiders hidden among its overhangingwebs. With an effort, he forced himself to stand upright, and to return to theworld of normal consciousness.Asmak also freed himself from the spell of the goddess; his enormous will powerenabled him to do this without effort.\"Shall we return, my lord?\" Like Dravig, he had sensed that Niall preferred todispense with formality. When Niall made a gesture of assent, Asmak turned andled the way across the floor of the cave.Niall had expected to be taken back to the low doorway through which they hadentered; instead, Asmak led Niall in the opposite direction, along the walltoward the far end of the cave. They had to circumnavigate veils of cobweb thathad concealed entrances to the tombs of spider lords and counselors since thedays of Cheb the Mighty. The cave extended further than Niall had suspected;what he had supposed to be its far wall was pierced by a low arch, on the otherside of which were irregular pinnacles of some sedimentary rock, which rose likeimmense stalagmites toward an invisible ceiling. Beyond these, the floor sloped,and they had to wade ankle deep through freezing water, which seemed to beflowing from a hole at the base of the wall. The moisture, Niall recognized, wasessential if the corpses of the dead spiders were not to crumble into dust.They were now advancing toward a vertical rock face, in which Niall couldperceive no obvious exits. He was within a few feet of it before he recognizedthat a sloping ramp or ledge ran upwards in a roughly diagonal line.Asmak halted. \"Would you prefer to go first?\"\"No. You go first.\"As soon as they began to mount, he regretted his decision. The ledge wasscarcely a foot wide, and its surface was rough and irregular. If his footslipped, he would be hurtling downward before Asmak could save him. But it wastoo late to change his mind. Spiders attached a great deal of importance toface-saving, and if he reversed his decision, Asmak would be more embarrassedthan he was. So he stepped onto the ledge and cautiously followed Asmak into thedarkness.Spiders, he soon realized, had no fear of heights; it made no difference to themwhether they were ten feet off the ground or a thousand. For a spider whose legspan was normally eight feet, bunching them together onto a narrow ledge shouldhave been uncomfortable; but even in this awkward position, Asmak moved swiftlyand unerringly. Niall, on the other hand, felt increasing alarm as his feetstumbled on the irregular surface. Within a few minutes they were hundreds offeet above the floor of the cave, and the ramp ahead of them seemed to stretchendlessly into the darkness. The rock face was rough, but afforded no handholds.Niall had never liked heights; they filled him with an instinctive dread overwhich his mind had little control. Now his alarm made his legs feel weak; thiswas even more terrifying than wriggling into a narrow tunnel in the rock. Hepressed his back to the wall, and walked with a sideways motion, glad that Asmakwas looking straight ahead.Five minutes later the ledge became narrower still, and it struck him that hisalarm was endangering his life more than the difficulties of the ascent; thoughtof the immense drop below flooded his bloodstream with adrenaline, making himfeel weak and light-headed. At this point he recalled the thought mirror whichhe had left behind in his room, and experienced a despairing feeling of regretthat he had forgotten to take it. But the thought brought a momentary sense ofconcentration which was like sudden relief from nausea. He wrinkled his foreheadand clenched his fists, trying to recapture the feeling of control induced bythe thought mirror. At the same time, he told himself that nothing could be morestupid than terminating his career through weakness and loss of nerve.Then, in a flash, he saw the answer. What he recognized, with sudden totalcertainty, was that he was not here by chance. What had led him into his presentsituation was some kind of destiny -- the same destiny that had brought him tothe spider city and enabled him to free his fellow humans from their slavery. Ifhe fell now, it would be because he was destined to fall. And that, he saw, wasan absurdity. Whatever he was destined for, it was not to die by accident.The sense of panic evaporated and was replaced by an almost dreamlike feeling ofconfidence and certainty. Suddenly, it seemed to him that he understood Qisib'slast words -- that an unbroken spirit is unconquerable. It was exactly as if afence had been erected between himself and the abyss. It now seemed to him thatthe ledge was wide enough for two persons. He ceased to press his back againstthe wall, and once more began to walk forward in the normal manner.Asmak said: \"We are almost there. If you will excuse me, I will guide yourfootsteps until the worst part is over.\"At this point, the rock face bulged outwards, and a series of foot- andhandholds had been cut into it. But the slope of the bulge meant that these werenarrow and inadequate; as Niall climbed up after Asmak, he became aware that theslightest movement toward the left would cause him to lose his grip. Asmak'sguidance was necessary because the holds were at irregular intervals, and it wassometimes necessary to place both feet in the same narrow step to reach the nexthandhold. Toward the top of the bulge, their movement ceased to be diagonal, andbecame almost horizontal. But at least Niall felt that he was in Asmak's hands,and that the spider had no intention of allowing him to fall.A moment later, they had surmounted the bulge, and Niall's feet were once againfirmly planted on the narrow ledge. It struck him as amusing that he should feelas relieved as if they were back on solid ground.A hundred yards further on, the ledge suddenly widened. The rock above bulgedoutward, so that it was necessary to crouch to avoid banging his head, but thiswas a minor inconvenience. A few yards further, he became aware that there was arock face on his left as well as his right, and that they had entered a narrowtunnel that smelled of mold. There was another smell which he recognized withrelief -- that of damp earth. The air also became noticeably warmer. Now theroof of the tunnel was supported by wooden props, and the ground underfoot hadbeen cut into a series of steps, also reinforced with wooden boards. Momentslater, his eyes were dazzled by an explosion of light that made him close themtightly; he stumbled on a step and fell to his knees.Asmak said: \"I am sorry, lord. I should have warned you.\" The light vanished;when Niall cautiously opened his eyes, they were in a green twilight. Then Asmakagain moved aside the curtain of vegetation, and the tunnel entrance wasilluminated by the light of the rising sun.He had to crawl out on his hands and knees -- the entrance, which was in asteeply sloping bank, was hidden by bushes that grew close to the ground, andconcealed by a large moss-covered stone. The warm air was full of an odor thatresembled new-mown hay, mingled with the scent of honeysuckle and gorse. Evenbefore he pushed his way out into the daylight, Niall knew where he was; thesight of the banks of rich vegetation, with their red and yellow flowers, onlyconfirmed it. He was standing at a spot within a hundred yards of the warehousethat Skorbo had used as a larder, and the air was full of the tingling vitalitythat was like a fine spray of water.Now, suddenly, Niall understood why the flowers here bloomed in midwinter. Itwas because this spot stood directly above the sacred cave, and its earth waspermeated by the tremendous energies that were stored there. The life-force ofthe goddess created a kind of permanent springtide. This was also the reasonthat Skorbo had chosen the site for his larder: its energies kept his paralyzedvictims alive.It came as something of a surprise to find that it was already dawn -- althoughNiall should have realized it when the young spiders were absorbing and storingthe life-force of the empress plant. The total darkness of the sacred cave hadprevented him from making the connection. Now he realized with astonishment thathe had spent the whole night underground. The time had passed so quickly that itseemed no more than two hours.Asmak said: \"Shall I summon a chariot to take you back to your palace?\"\"No. It's such a lovely morning that I think I'll walk. But first I'd like torest for a moment.\"\"Of course.\"A patch of rich green lawn between the flowering shrubs looked very inviting;the thick, springy grass reminded Niall of the Great Delta. He lay down with hishead against the root of a tree, and closed his eyes. The sun seemed to caressthe skin of his cheeks and forehead. Buoyed up on a feeling of peace that waslike a rising wave, he was carried into sleep.He was aroused by a vague feeling of discomfort; the sun had moved around a fewdegrees, leaving him in shadow, and a cool breeze had sprung up from the east. Aglance at the sky told him that he had been asleep for at least two hours.As he sat up, he realized that the spider standing a few feet away was notAsmak, but his son Grel. The glossy black hairs on the young spider's body shonelike ebony in the morning sunlight.\"Where is your father?\"\"He apologizes for having to leave. He has to be at work.\"Niall yawned and rubbed his eyes. His stomach rumbled; he had never felt sohungry in his life. \"Thank you for waiting.\"\"Thanks are unnecessary. It would be unlawful to leave you unguarded.\"\"I did not intend to fall asleep -- only to close my eyes. Are you not tired?\"\"No. The sacred cave always makes me feel more awake.\"\"You have been before then?\"\"Seven times. But never before have I stood in the presence of Cheb the Mighty,or his counselor Qisib.\"As Niall received these words -- transmitted directly, without the encumbranceof language -- he was able to see into the young spider's mind, and to recognizethat the experiences of the past few hours had made a profound difference. TheGrel of the previous evening had been little more than a thoughtless child; thisGrel was almost an adult.They were walking past Skorbo's larder, and Niall paused to look in through theopen door. The warehouse was completely empty; not even a single strand of webnow dangled from the beams that supported the ceiling. Only a red stain on theconcrete floor -- the blood of the bull spider -- remained as a reminder of whathad happened so recently.The air was soft and warm, heavy with the scent of flowers; he realized that thewind was blowing from the south. As they walked back along the sandstone-coloredroad, which looked as if it had been built only yesterday, past glowing banks offlowers, Niall became aware that his companion was bursting with a desire to askhim a question, but was forbidden by spider protocol to address a superiorwithout being spoken to first. In an older spider, this desire would have beenundetectable; but Grel had not yet learned the art of self-concealment. Niallasked: \"What is it you want to know?\"If Grel had been a human child, he would have blushed. But the intensity of hiscuriosity overcame his embarrassment. \"Now that you know the history of theenemy, do you intend to seek him out?\"Niall shook his head. \"What purpose would that serve?\"\"But the Lord Qisib said you would be making a perilous journey.\"This was a point Niall had already considered. \"That is true. But I have alreadymade a perilous journey -- out of the sacred cave.\"But Grel was still unsatisfied. \"The Lord Cheb also wished you a safe voyage.\"Niall had noticed that, but assumed that it was simply a form of politeleave-taking. He said firmly: \"It is not my intention to seek out this magician.That would be foolish and very dangerous. It is obvious that he wants to be leftalone.\"\"Then why does he not leave us alone?\"Because Grel was so young and so obviously curious, Niall felt an impulse totake him into his confidence. \"I believe the enemy has been sending out spiessince the days of Cheb the Mighty. He wants to know what is happening in thespider city. But when Skorbo captured two of his spies, and carried them off tohis larder, he decided that Skorbo had to die.\"Grel asked: \"But why? What good could it do?\"This was a point that Niall himself had puzzled about during the past two days.If his spies were captured, surely it would be better for the enemy to send morespies, rather than alerting the spiders to his presence? Was it stupidity ormiscalculation? Niall found that hard to believe.\"One reason could be that Skorbo himself was a spy.\"\"What!\" Grel was so staggered that the exclamation was a shriek of protest.\"Skorbo a spy? How is that possible?\"His amazement made Niall feel guilty; he had simply failed to see theimplications of what he had just said. For a spider, nothing could be moreshocking, more horrifying, than the thought of the treachery of one of their ownkind. Human beings are accustomed to being unable to see into one another'sminds -- even those we love best. But all spiders experience a sense of mutualinteraction that is inconceivable to human beings. So the thought of treacherywas far worse than the shock a man might feel if he discovered that the wife headored had been unfaithful or was planning to murder him. Grel was shaken to hisdepths.Niall said gently: \"There is evidence that Skorbo fell into the hands of theenemy and was enrolled as a spy.\"\"But how could he be so wicked?\" Grel was almost in tears. \"How could he betrayhis fellow creatures?\"\"I do not know. But the magician can be very persuasive.\"Grel dissented passionately. \"No. Skorbo could only be overcome by a willstronger than his own.\"\"Perhaps the magician's will was stronger than Skorbo's.\"\"I cannot believe that.\"Asmak would have been horrified to hear his son contradicting the emissary ofthe goddess; but Niall was flattered at this evidence of the young spider'strust. \"Then what do you believe?\"\"Perhaps that Skorbo was tortured into submission. It is evident that the enemyis a man of extreme cruelty.\"\"He is cunning, certainly. But why do you say he is cruel?\"Grel seemed puzzled by Niall's question. \"Does a benevolent ruler cut out thetongues of his subjects?\"\"Who told you that?\"\"Why, the lord Qisib himself.\"The mental image of Qisib was followed immediately by an image of Madig beingwashed and combed in his prison cell. And now Niall could see that, as the girlwas trimming his beard, Madig caught a glimpse inside her mouth, and saw thatshe had no tongue.Suddenly he understood why they had been speaking at cross-purposes. Qisib hadtold his story in a series of images. At the time, Niall has felt pleased withhimself because he understood so well. Now he realized that his understandinghad been crude and imperfect, like someone trying to understand a foreignlanguage. Qisib's \"conversation\" had been full of details that Niall had simplyfailed to notice. Madig's glimpse into the girl's mouth had been only one ofthese. And as Grel recreated the image of Madig's cell, Niall became aware ofmany others. He could now sense the atmosphere of suspicion, mistrust, andanxiety that reigned in the city of the enemy, and the fear and misery that itcreated. And as Madig was led, blindfolded, through the streets of the city,Niall realized that the silence was the silence of dread.He also understood many other things: how, when the magician had told Madig thathis companions would die if he failed to bring back a satisfactory answer, hemeant that they would die slowly and painfully. Now it was clear that, from thebeginning of the interview, the magician had set out to instill a feeling ofterror and of danger, so that Madig would convey this to the Spider Lord.Grel added with satisfaction: \"But he made one mistake. He failed to understandthat no Spider Lord would give way to threats.\"Niall was about to reply when he was struck by the import of Grel's words. Theinsight that followed was accompanied by an odd sense of breathlessness, and atingling of the hairs of the scalp. \"Perhaps it was not a mistake. Perhaps theenemy intended to anger the Spider Lord.\"\"But why?\"Niall was suddenly astonished that it had taken him so long to grasp anything soobvious. \"Why do you think the attacks ceased as soon as the Lord Qisib beganbuilding the wall?\"Grel said hesitantly: \"Perhaps because it was too well guarded.\"\"So was the town of Cibilla, yet they attacked it.\"\"Then what do you believe was the reason?\"\"Could it have been because they wanted the wall to be built?\"Grel was obviously puzzled by Niall's line of reasoning. \"But the wall was builtto keep them out.\"\"But it also served the purpose of keeping your people in.\"It took several moments for Grel to grasp the point. When he did so, he gazed atMall with an air of almost reverential astonishment. \"Truly, you have morediscernment than Qisib the Wise.\" Then his mind was beset by doubts: \"Yet howcan we be certain of something that happened so long ago?\"\"We cannot be certain. But consider what the Lord Qisib told us. First: thatCheb the Mighty sent an expedition to the lands of the north, and learned thatthe ice had retreated, and that the marshes were full of birds and other wildgame. Then Kasib the Warrior sent Madig to select a site for the new city. Wasit by chance, do you think, that Madig's party was waylaid and carried intocaptivity? Or was it because the magician was keeping watch for any sign thatthe Death Lord was extending his territory, and was determined to prevent himfrom establishing a new capital in the northlands?\"\"But the northlands were the home of Cheb the Mighty. Why should he not returnhome?\"\"Because the ice had retreated. The Death Lord himself told me that when he wasborn, the world was suffering from a great ice age when the snow fell day andnight, and the sky was always dark. In such an age, there would be no temptationto explore. But when the ice melted, the northern lands ceased to be cold andforbidding. And if Kasib the Warrior had established a capital in the wastes ofKend, would he have been contented to rest there? Would he not have turned hisattention to the Gray Mountains in the west, with their wide valleys?\"Grel listened with a mixture of astonishment and incredulity. Niall continued:\"The Lord Qisib also told us that when Tubin went in search of Madig, he foundonly his dagger, which was pointing toward the Gray Mountains. Were his captorsso stupid that they failed to notice a dagger driven into the ground? Is it notmore probable that they themselves set the dagger there?\"Grel was troubled. \"But why should the enemy tell us where he could be found?\"\"As a warning and a message. He was telling the Death Lord: the Gray Mountainsare my territory -- keep away. But the Death Lord sent hundreds of spiderballoons to search the Gray Mountains and the wastes of Kend, making it clearthat he regarded them as his territory.\"\"Then what purpose was served by harassing the city of Cibilla?\"\"He knew that this would enrage the Death Lord into launching an attack.\"As Grel grasped the implications of these words, he reacted with shock. \"You aresaying that the Death Lord and his army marched into a trap?\"\"That would explain many things.\"Grel seemed stunned. \"But how could the enemy cause the great storm?\"\"I do not know. But I know that all magicians believe they can control theweather.\"As if in answer to this remark, a low roll of thunder echoed across the city.Niall had been so absorbed in the conversation that he had not even noticed thedark clouds that had drifted across the sun. Now he realized they were close tothe main square, and the clouds were reflected in the milky surface of the whitetower as if in a mirror. A few moments later, the first light drops of rainspotted the pavement; within seconds, it had turned into a heavy downpour. Allover the square, humans and spiders ran for shelter as the hammering of rainturned the pavement into a white mist. When the rain began, they had been withina few yards of the palace; yet by the time they stood under its portico, bothwere drenched. Water drops ran like pearls from Grel's shiny black coat; some ofthem also gathered on his many-faceted eyes, so that he was forced to shake hishead.A few minutes later, the downpour had ceased. But the sudden change in theweather had made Niall reflective. It had made him recall the snow that hadfallen only three days ago, and how quickly it had vanished. \"All magiciansbelieve they can control the weather. . .\" Now his own words were like an echowhose meaning eluded him. Could there be any significance in the fact thatSkorbo's death had been accompanied by a fall of snow?His train of thought was disturbed by the opening of the door. It was Dona,dressed in a cloak with a waterproof hood. Her gaze was so abstracted that for amoment she failed to recognize Niall. When she did, her face brightened. \"Wherehave you been? We've been looking for you all night.\"\"I'm sorry. . .\"As he looked into her eyes, he experienced a sudden sense offoreboding. \"Is anything wrong?\"\"It's Veig. . .\"His heart turned to lead. \"Is he. . .\"\"He has been unconscious since last night.\"As Niall started to follow her inside, he remembered Grel. \"Please come insideand wait. I have to go to my brother.\"He followed her along a corridor and across the courtyard, to the older part ofthe building; Veig occupied two large rooms on the ground floor.At first sight, Veig seemed to be dead. He was lying on his back, and theblack-bearded face looked pale and thin. His mother was sitting on the side ofthe bed, with her hand on Veig's forehead; she looked exhausted. Simeon wasseated on a chair on the far side of the bed.Niall went to the bedside, and touched his brother's cheek. He was relieved tofind that it was warm. But when he probed Veig's mind, he realized that he wasclose to death. The fever had disappeared, but so had the determination to live.All conflicts had disappeared; in their place there was a flat calm that waslike an endless plane of grayness.Siris said: \"He was asking for you.\"\"I'm sorry.\" Her face was as bloodless as Veig's. He felt an overwhelming rushof affection, a desire to take her in his arms and comfort her. \"Why don't yougo and rest? I'll sit with Veig.\"\"No, I'd rather stay.\" He knew she meant that she would never forgive herself ifVeig died in her absence.Once again Niall probed his brother's mind. It was like trying to plunge into asea of nothingness. This grayness was somehow cold and repellant, resisting allefforts to see beyond it. Even to contemplate it had a numbing effect on hissenses. What puzzled Niall was that a sleeping mind should be a mysteriouswhirlpool of forces, not a closed door. And even as he was about to abandon theeffort, he seemed to sense Veig's presence behind the closed door. Then thegrayness returned, as uniform as a blanket of snow.Simeon stood up. \"I'll come back later.\" Siris nodded without even raising herhead.Niall followed Simeon from the room. \"Have you any idea of what's wrong?\"\"Only that it's not a poison. It's some kind of bacterium.\"\"How do you know?\"\"It was visible on the microscope slide -- it looks like hundreds of blackrods.\"\"And it came from the blade of the ax?\"\"Of course. You saw me take a scraping. But there's something very odd aboutthese black rods. Most bacteria can't survive apart from a living body. But whenI dissolved the scrapings in salt solution, it was immediately swarming withbacteria, like a pond full of tadpoles.\" He pulled a face. \"And now Veig'sbloodstream is full of tadpoles.\"\"And do you think they came from Skorbo's blood?\"\"It's possible. I just don't know.\"They emerged into the hallway; it was empty except for Grel, who was standing inthe center of the marble floor with the total immobility that was socharacteristic of spiders.Niall said: \"I am sorry to keep you waiting. My brother is ill.\"Grel said drily: \"That does not surprise me.\"Niall looked at him in astonishment. \"Why do you say that?\"\"Because this place is full of evil.\"\"Evil!\"\"Can you not feel it?\"Niall allowed his mind to blend with that of the young spider. The first thinghe noticed was Grel's state of nervous tension, as if he was watching theapproach of an enemy. Then, with startling suddenness, he himself was aware ofthe cause of the tension. It was so obvious that he was surprised that he hadfailed to notice it earlier. It was the now-familiar sensation that he was inthe presence of some dangerous entity. He had experienced this same sense ofdanger in the presence of the force field of the pendants. Yet this vibrationwas subtly different: at once more powerful and less obtrusive.Niall turned to Simeon. \"Do you know if any strangers have been admitted while Ihave been away?\"\"Not as far as I know. I've been here most of the night.\"As soon as Niall's mind lost contact with that of the spider, the sense ofdanger receded. Yet because he had been alerted to its presence, he remainedaware of it as a disturbing vibration, like something glimpsed out of the cornerof the eye.He asked Grel: \"Is there someone here -- some enemy?\" He spoke aloud, so thatSimeon could understand.\"There is some evil presence. We should summon my father, and have this buildingsurrounded by guards.\"Simeon asked: \"What did he say?\"\"He said we should summon the soldiers.\"Simeon looked around at the silent hall; the only sound was the clatter ofcooking utensils from the kitchen.\"I think he's imagining things. No one could get past the guard.\"\"No, he's speaking the truth. I can sense it too.\" He asked Grel: \"Where do youthink this enemy is hiding?\"Grel extended his pedipalps like feelers. \"He is upstairs somewhere.\"Niall experienced a cold sensation. He knew that his sisters would now be eatingbreakfast in the nursery, and that since Dona was in Veig's room, they wouldprobably be alone. As Niall started up the stairs, Simeon said: \"Let me call theguard.\"Niall shook his head. \"If it's a man, that shouldn't be necessary.\" Even aspider as young as Grel could paralyze a man into immobility.He paused on the first landing, and tried to soothe his senses into totalimmobility; but there was too much adrenaline in his bloodstream, and it wasimpossible. Instead, he stood and waited for Grel to join him. With hispedipalps still extended the spider turned right, and continued on up the secondflight of stairs. As he did so, Niall experienced a sudden flash of intuitivecertainty: where else would an enemy wait for him but in his own room? And whenGrel paused in front of the door of Niall's chamber, and stayed there in a stateof uncertainty -- the spider claw was not designed to handle doorknobs -- Nialltiptoed past him and stood with his ear pressed against the cold wood. There wasnot the slightest sound from inside. Very slowly and deliberately, he turned theknob and pushed open the door.His chamber looked so normal that for a moment he was inclined to wonder if theywere making some absurd mistake. But the tension in Grel's attitude -- he lookedlike a snake poised to strike -- made it clear that he could still sense danger.Since this room was empty, then it must lie either in the bedroom or in Jarita'sscullery. The bedroom door was standing slightly ajar; Niall gave it a violentpush so that it flew open. A glance inside told him that there was no one there-- from this position he could even see under the bed.As he hesitated, debating whether to investigate the scullery, or to summon theguard, Grel advanced past him and into the bedroom. He crossed the floor in asingle stride, and, to Niall's surprise, halted in front of the table at theside of the bed. This contained only an oil lamp, a glass of water, and a neatlyfolded tunic that had been placed there by Jarita. Yet it was at this tunic thatGrel seemed to be directing his attention.Niall went and stood beside him. \"What is it?\" He reached out cautiously, andtwitched aside the tunic; all that it covered was the green figurine that he hadfound in the hideout of the assassins.In his relief, he allowed his mind to relax; as soon as he did so, he realizedthat Grel was not mistaken. This squat figure, with its froglike face andbulging eyes, was the source of the force field that was filling the room withits curious vibration of menace. Moreover, as Niall removed the cloth, theentity seemed to become aware of their presence. In that moment, Niall wasgripped by an acute sense of danger. His reaction was instinctive andinstantaneous; he struck out and knocked the figurine onto the floor. As hishand touched it, he was convulsed by a feeling of nausea that was like anunutterably foul stench; it was so powerful that it seemed to distort hissenses. As he looked round the room for some weapon, his eyes fell on the axthat was standing in the corner beside the wardrobe. It had been there sinceSimeon had taken scrapings from its blade, and its head was wrapped in a pieceof sacking. Fighting off a desire to vomit, Niall tore off the sacking andraised the ax above his head; positioning himself carefully, he brought down theback of the blade with all his strength. It struck the figurine squarely, andthe force of the blow almost split the floorboards beneath it. A moment later,he was engulfed by a wave of malevolence that burst over him like a flood ofslimy water, the sheer rage of a being who could not believe that someone haddared to attack him.Incredibly, the figurine was undamaged, although it was lying on its side. AgainNiall raised the ax, this time turning the blade side downward. The cutting edgestruck the figurine a jarring blow, breaking it into two pieces. One half flewacross the room to strike the wall; the other disappeared under the bed. In thatmoment the malevolent presence vanished as abruptly as a light that isextinguished. The stench also vanished -- so completely that it seemedincredible that it had left no trace behind.Simeon said: \"What in the name of the goddess was that?\" His voice soundedbreathless. He bent and picked up the piece of stone that had come to rest nearhis foot. It was the head of the figurine, and it had been severed in such a waythat half the back was still attached to it. Niall dropped onto his hands andknees, and recovered the other half of the figurine from under the bed.Simeon took it, and studied it closely. \"This isn't just a toad. It's some kindof god.\"\"How do you know?\"Simeon pointed to the tiny humanoid feet, which now struck Niall as oddlyrepellant. \"Because it's half man. . . look.\" He placed the two halves of thefigure together. The moment he did so, the threatening presence seemed to darkenthe air like a cloud, filling the room with its stench. Before Niall could shouta warning, Simeon had given a cry of disgust and dropped the figurine. Thepresence instantly vanished.Niall asked: \"What happened?\"\"I'm not sure. It seemed to come alive.\" He grimaced and spat. \"It was liketouching a slug.\"Niall cautiously picked up the upper half of the figure. But when he closed hiseyes and withdrew into the still center of his mind, he could no longer detectany kind of force field. It was simply an ordinary piece of green stone,probably jadeite or nephrite, and the surface where it had been split glitteredlike fluorspar.Jarita appeared in the doorway. She looked startled to find Grel in the room.But Niall could see from her expression that she had no idea that anythingunusual had taken place.She said: \"Your guest is awake, my lord.\"\"My guest?\" He had no idea what she was talking about. \"The guest in the roomnext door.\" She made a gesture in which Niall detected an element of disdain.He was startled. \"How do you know?\"\"I heard her trying the door.\"Niall snatched the key from his dressing table and hurried out into thecorridor. As he unlocked the door, he experienced a curious mixture ofanticipation and dread. But when he tried to open it, the door met someresistance. He forced it open a few inches, then saw the nature of theobstruction. The girl was resting against it in a kneeling posture, with herforehead against the wood. Her position suggested that she had been standingclose to the door when she collapsed.Niall pushed his way into the room, followed by Simeon. The movement of the doorcaused the girl to collapse sideways; as her cheek struck the floor, her mouthfell open. Simeon knelt beside her and took her wrist. Niall knew what he wasgoing to say before he said it.\"She's dead.\"Jarita, who was standing in the doorway, said: \"She was alive half a minuteago.\"Niall said: \"I know.\"He turned and pushed his way past Jarita.Simeon called: \"Where are you going?\"\"To my brother.\"Fear compressed his heart as he hurried down the stairs and along the corridorthat led to the courtyard. The thought of the dead girl filled him with baffledrage. What had happened was suddenly obvious. When he had split the figurine,the presence had vanished and the girl had recovered consciousness. But a fewseconds later, Simeon had reunited the halves, and the presence had taken theopportunity to silence her. There was no point in feeling angry with Simeon; ifhe was to blame for reuniting the halves of the figurine, then Niall was also toblame for allowing it to happen.The thought that now filled him with dread was that his brother might also havefallen victim to the force that had killed the girl. As he crossed thecourtyard, he told himself that if his brother was dead, he would devote therest of his life to destroying the magician.What he saw as he entered the room made him feel as if his body had turned tostone. His mother was embracing Veig, her cheek pressed against his. Dona, whowas standing by the bed, was crying. Then, as Niall hesitated, crushed andappalled, Veig's hand moved to caress his mother's hair. At the same moment,Dona turned toward him, and he saw that she was smiling. He sighed in anexplosion of relief. A moment later, Veig was looking up at him with a puzzledexpression, as if failing to recognize him. Then he smiled. \"Hello, brother.\"The large hairy hand made a vague gesture of greeting, then fell back onto thecounterpane.Niall, suddenly ashamed of his panic, could not trust himself to speak.Dona said: \"He's all right now.\" Something in her voice made Niall aware thather feelings were also deeper than she was willing to show.Niall asked: \"When did he wake up?\"\"A few minutes ago.\"Siris asked: \"Has the doctor gone?\"\"No.\" It was Simeon who replied as he entered the room. Grel hesitated behindhim in the doorway. Simeon placed a hand on Veig's forehead, and took his wristbetween his finger and thumb. \"That's remarkable. His temperature's back tonormal.\"Siris said: \"It's your medicine.\"\"Not entirely.\" His eyes met Niall's.Dona asked: \"Is he going to be all right now?\"\"Oh, I think so. The poison seems to have worked its way out of his system.\" Heasked Veig: \"How do you feel?\"\"Better. Much better.\"\"Give him some broth. He should be up and about in a few days.\"Dona flung an arm impulsively round his neck and kissed him on the cheek. Simeonwas obviously pleased. \"Don't thank me. Thank him.\" He gestured toward Grel. \"Hefound out what was causing it.\"Dona stared at Grel with wide eyes. \"What was causing it?\"Niall was anxious to avoid explanations. \"I'll go and tell the cook to bringsoup.\"As they crossed the courtyard Grel said: \"He is wrong. Your brother is stillsick.\"\"How do you know?\"\"His bloodstream is full of life-suckers.\" The image that accompanied the wordswas of leeches.Simeon caught up with them. \"Do you understand what's going on?\"\"I think so. The stone frog was more dangerous than I thought.\"\"I realize that.\" He added somberly: \"I also realize it was my fault that thegirl died.\"\"No, mine. The Steegmaster warned me it was alive. I thought it had beenneutralized.\"Simeon shrugged. \"Nothing can bring her back now. But I'd like to know what itwas trying to do to your brother. Why didn't it kill him, too?\"Niall shook his head. \"Perhaps because you dropped the halves before it hadtime.\" He asked Grel: \"What do you think?\"Grel hesitated before speaking. \"I think, lord, that your brother will dieanyway.\"Niall was shocked. \"But why? He seems to be getting better.\"It obviously cost Grel an effort to speak his mind. \"He has been poisoned by theenemy. Just as Madig was poisoned. I am afraid that nothing can save him.\"\"Madig poisoned? But how?\"\"Did you not see?\" In the sequence of images that followed, Grel somehow causedNiall to identify with Madig, as if seeing through his eyes. He was standing inthe cold hall of the magician, listening to the soft swish of garmentsdescending toward him, then to the voice that said: \"You will also tell yourmaster that I shall hold your companions as hostages, and that unless his answeris satisfactory, they will also die.\"Niall's hand was taken in a hand that was cold and rough. And although he wasanticipating what was to happen next, he found it difficult not to scream aloudas the powerful grip threatened to crush his bones. But this time he observedsomething that he had failed to notice when listening to Qisib the Wise: thatsomething sharp -- like a needle-had pierced his palm close to the base of theindex finger. He guessed that the magician was wearing a ring with a spike onit.The voice came close to his ear. \"One more thing. Tell your master that if heignores my warning, his people will suffer a catastrophe that will make themassacres of Ivar the Cruel seem insignificant.\" The hand released his. \"Youhave one month -- thirty days.\"Simeon was watching his face closely, aware that something strange washappening.Niall repeated: \"Thirty days.\"\"What?\"\"Thirty days. And it happened two days ago. My brother has another twenty-eightdays to live.\"Simeon said brusquely: \"What are you talking about? He's already on the mend.\"Niall shook his head. \"No. Madig died after thirty days. This magician has thepower to kill from a distance. That is why he said: My arm is long and I do notrelease my grip.\"He thought of his mother, and of his sisters and of Dona, and for a moment feltvulnerable and helpless. It seemed unfair that he should have to deal withproblems that were so completely beyond his normal experience. At that moment hesaw the little kitchen maid descending the stairs with a tray in her hands. Itjogged his memory. \"Nyra, please take some soup to my brother.\"Her face broke into a smile of delight, reminding him that, like Dona, she had acertain personal interest in his brother.\"Yes lord.\"As she halted to curtsy, his moment of weakness passed. She had somehow remindedhim that, as master of this city, he could not afford weakness. He waited forthe kitchen door to close behind her, then said: \"I must seek out thismagician.\"Simeon shot an astonished glance from under his bushy eyebrows. \"With an army?\"\"No. There is no time to take an army. I must travel alone.\"\"That would be dangerous and foolhardy.\"\"I agree. But I must find out what he wants.\"\"You know what he wants. He is a totally ruthless man who would not hesitate tokill you.\"\"I know that. But I still don't know what he wants. And there is only one way Ican find out.\" He turned to Grel, smiling. \"So you see, you were right afterall. I am going on a long journey.\"\"It was not I but the Lord Qisib who foretold it. He is never wrong.\"\"I believe you. And now I wish I had asked him one more question.\"\"What question, lord?\"\"Whether I shall also make the return journey.\" Scan Notes, v3.0: This is labeled Book 5 even though the DT is labeled Book 3.This is because the first three books were originally published seperately, andthen collected as one later, stupidly changing the numbering of the series.
