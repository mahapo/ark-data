When I made it, it seemed entirelylogical.I had left school in July 1947, a month after my sixteenth birthday. If it hadbeen a possibility, I would have applied for a university scholarship. But myfather wanted me to go to work and contribute to the family budget. He was inthe boot and shoe trade, and had worked throughout the 1930s for about £3 aweek; even now, he had to work as a barman in the evenings to make ends meet. Myyounger brother Barry had left school at fourteen to become a butcher’s boy, andmy father was resentful that he had had to support me for two years longer.It was my ambition to be a scientist. Ever since reading Sir James Jeans’sMysterious Universe at the age of twelve, my daydream had been to becomeEinstein’s successor. But to become a scientist I needed a Bachelor of Sciencedegree, and the first step was to be an apprentice at some large chemical firmlike ICI, and study for a degree in my spare time. In my final exams at school.But I failed to get a credit in maths, which meant taking the exam again afterleaving school. Meanwhile, I took the only job the Labour Exchange could offerme, working in a wool-processing factory.Going to work came as a shock. I started at eight in the morning and left at sixat night, with an hour for lunch. The upper part of the factory was occupied bywomen standing in front of winding machines. It was my job to keep them suppliedwith hanks of wool and, when this had been wound on to bobbins, to take itdownstairs and pack it in crates. The work was hard, but dreary and repetitive,and by the time I cycled home I was exhausted and depressed. I would spend theevening reading poetry as an emotional relief. I loved Keats and the Romantics,but in this state of dejection found that my mood was reflected best by Eliot’sThe Waste Land and ‘Hollow Men’.One day, when I had returned to my old school to borrow some maths books, theheadmaster told me that if I got the extra credit in maths, I could return toschool and work as a laboratory assistant. And I would be given free time towork for my inter-B.Sc. The idea sounded wonderful, and if this had happened afew months earlier, it would have filled me with delight. But there was now aproblem. Since I had been spending all my spare time soaking up poetry, I hadlost all interest in science.I felt it would be unwise to admit this. So I took my maths exam, gained myextra credit, and before Christmas 1947 was back at school and wearing a whitelab coat.I had taken the exams in Birmingham, thirty miles from my home town, Leicester,travelling there daily on the train. I loved the train journey, for I had so fardone little travelling, and even the flat Midland landscape seemed exciting. Andone day I walked into Birmingham public library, which was far bigger thanLeicester’s, and was overwhelmed by the high shelves that stretched to theceiling and had to be reached on ladders. There were books I had always wantedto read; like most teenagers I loved horror stories, and the sight of Maturin’sMelmoth the Wanderer and Lewis’s The Monk made me wish I lived in Birmingham.Standing in the library I suddenly knew what I wanted: to spend my days readingfrom morning till night. I had realised that books are a world in themselves, asimmense and varied as the real world.I found the laboratory job an enormous relief after the factory; it was likebeing let out of prison. But the question of my future still worried me. Thethree months in the factory had been a glimpse into an abyss of boredom andrepetitiveness. And now my loss of interest in science meant I no longer had afuture. It seemed that society had no place for people like me, people who hadno desire to ‘get on in life’.Sooner or later, the headmaster would find out that I had no interest in appliedmathematics or analytical chemistry, and I would be without a job. And then Iwould go to the Labour Exchange and be offered a choice of a dozen or so jobsthat I found equally repellent. As far as I could see, I was going to have tospend my whole life doing jobs I hated.I continued to find an escape in literature, spending my weekends devouringpoetry. But this only made it harder to go back to work on Monday morning. Andthe physics master who was my immediate boss soon realised that I was thereunder false pretences, and took every opportunity to inflict petty humiliations.But I discovered one marvellous way of restoring a sense of purpose: writing. Ihad listened to a radio programme about Samuel Pepys, and decided to startkeeping a journal – not just a diary of my daily activities, but a record ofwhat I thought and felt. I had borrowed from the library a book called IBelieve, full of statements of faith by people like Einstein, Julian Huxley andH. G. Wells. One Saturday, after spending the morning in the laboratory, Ibought a fat notebook, and settled down to writing my own statement of what Ibelieved about my place in the world.I wrote for page after page, with a sense of freedom and release. I wasobjectifying doubts and miseries, pushing them to arm’s length. When I put downmy pen, after several hours, I had a feeling that I was no longer the sameperson who had sat down at the writing table. It was as if I had been studyingmy face in a mirror, and learned something new about myself.From then on, I used my journal as a receptacle for self-doubt, irritation andgloom, and by doing so I wrote myself back into a state of optimism.After spending the weekend writing myself back into a state of optimism,however, I had to go back to school, to the niggling of the physics master andthe bafflement of crystallisation curves and the hydrodynamics ofincompressible, inviscid fluids. The optimism had evaporated by Mondayafternoon, and by Wednesday my mind felt dead.After one particularly irritating day, I returned home at teatime to find thehouse empty, and started pouring my frustrations into my journal before goingoff to my analytical chemistry class. It had been a very hot day, and I feltexhausted. After an hour of writing, I began to feel the burden lifting, andexperienced a trickling of relief that was like cool water. But I knew I wouldbe feeling the same boredom and frustration at the same time tomorrow and thenext day and the next. And suddenly it struck me that it was simply not logicalto go on living like this. I felt angry with God – or fate, or whoever had castme down into this irritating world – for subjecting me to these endless pettyhumiliations. I did not even believe human life was real; it had often struck methat time is some sort of illusion. But surely, I could turn my back on theillusions by killing myself?As soon as that thought occurred to me, I felt oddly calm and relieved. SuddenlyI felt in charge of myself and my destiny. If God was responsible for putting mehere, then I could spite him by declining to go on playing this silly game.As I cycled through the heat to my chemistry class, I felt strong and almostexalted. I arrived late, as usual, and endured the sarcasm of the professor withtotal indifference. And at the first opportunity, I went into the other room, tothe reagent shelves, and took down the bottle of hydrocyanic acid, with itswaxed glass stopper. I removed this, and smelled that distinctive almond smell.I knew that hydrocyanic acid would kill me in less than half a minute. Mentally,I had already raised the bottle and taken a swig of the bitter liquid.Then an odd thing happened. I became two people. I was suddenly conscious ofthis teenage idiot called Colin Wilson, with his misery and frustration, and heseemed such a limited fool that I could not have cared less whether he killedhimself or not. But if he killed himself, he would kill me too. For a moment Ifelt that I was standing beside him, and telling him that if he didn’t get ridof this habit of self-pity he would never amount to anything.It was also as if this ‘real me’ had said to the teenager: ‘Listen, you idiot,think how much you’d be losing,’ and in that moment I glimpsed the marvellous,immense richness of reality, extending to distant horizons.So I re-stoppered the bottle and went back to my analytical chemistry. I feltrelaxed and light-hearted and totally in control.This mood of strength lasted for two or three days, then gradually went away.But I no longer felt trapped and vulnerable.Forty years later, Marilyn Ferguson told me, as we walked by a lake inCalifornia, that she believed that everyone who achieves anything original inliterature or philosophy has been at some point on the brink of suicide. Isuspect that this is because anyone who has looked into this abyss achieves theseparation of the real self from the inessential self, which is like beingreborn. When, in 1955, I began to write my first book, The Outsider, I knew that itscentral question was whether we would all be more sensible to commit suicide. Bythat time I was aware that Albert Camus had written a book, The Myth ofSisyphus, declaring that suicide is the only serious philosophical question. Iwas also aware of the many ‘misfits’ who had committed suicide: Kleist, Beddoes,Stifter, Van Gogh, Hart Crane.Van Gogh especially fascinated me because of that feeling of life-affirmation incanvases like The Starry Night and Road With Cypresses, in which trees likegreen flames surge towards stars that are whirlpools of light. Yet when Van Goghcommitted suicide by shooting himself in the stomach, he left a note that read:‘Misery will never end.’ He seemed to epitomise the question that Carlyle called‘Everlasting Yes versus Everlasting No’. The question raised by The Outsider is:which has the last word?I was inclined to come down on the side of everlasting yes because the noesseemed to me often to be weak and to lack self-discipline, or to be indulging inpessimism because it tends to be more artistically effective.One day in the late 80s, I attended a day-long seminar in the Plymouth ArtsCentre in which I shared the platform with the poet David Gascoygne and thepsychologist R. D. Laing. I had known Gascoygne at the time of The Outsider, andbeen impressed by the force of his religious poetry. Laing I had never metbefore, although we had often come close to it on the ‘New Age’ lecture circuitin America. He told me he had decided to write his first book, The Divided Self,because he had read The Outsider and felt he ought to be able to write somethingequally successful.That day, Gascoygne lectured on surrealism, and seemed to take the view thatlife itself is bizarre and surrealistic. Laing argued his theory that thementally ill are not really ill, but are simply reflecting the sickness of oursociety. I explained why I had come to reject the pessimistic existentialism ofSartre and Camus, to create a form of existentialism whose implications arefundamentally optimistic.To my surprise, Laing and Gascoyne seemed to take this personally. When thethree of us finally got together on the platform for a symposium, they turned onme, taking the view that if I could be optimistic, it must be because I wasshallow and superficial. They made no attempt to argue their case, but behavedlike two schoolboys ganging up on a third. I suddenly realised that they wereactually affronted by my optimism, not simply on a level of ideas, but on apersonal level.Thinking about this later, I began to understand the reason. Gascoyne had hadseveral nervous breakdowns, and his haunted eyes showed it. Laing was analcoholic whose drunkenness led to his deregistration as a medical practitioner– although I did not know about this until I read a biography of him writtenafter his death in 1989.‘Outsiders’ – and both Laing and Gascoyne were undoubtedly of the Outsider type– are abnormally sensitive to this problem of ‘Everlasting Yes’ versus‘Everlasting No’. A friend of mine, the poet Charles Wrey Gardiner, wrote anautobiography entitled The Answer to Life is No. Gascoyne and Laing had reachedthe same conclusion. That was why they saw my optimism as some kind of criticismof themselves.What they were failing to grasp was that this optimism was not a matter oftemperament, but of logic. My starting point in The Outsider had been thosenineteenth-century Romantics who had experienced moments of overwhelmingdelight, of visions that filled them with optimism and affirmation – and thenawakened the next morning to wonder what the hell they meant by it. So many ofthem had died insane or committed suicide – in effect, having decided that ‘theanswer to life is No’.They felt that life is ultimately tragic because the ‘moments of vision’ seem toevaporate and leave nothing behind. Pushkin compared the poet’s heart to a coalthat glows red when the wind of inspiration blows on it, but turns into a blackcinder when the wind dies away. Most of my ‘Outsiders’ seemed to feel thateveryday life is a bore – what de Lisle Adam’s Axel meant when he said: ‘As forliving, our servants can do that for us.’The problem, clearly, was that there was no simple method of summoning the‘moment of vision’. What human beings seemed to need, as far as I could see, wasa kind of pump on the front of their heads, like the pump of a primus stove, sothey could increase the inner pressure with a few strokes. It was true thatdrugs or alcohol could sometimes do it, but they obviously carried heavypenalties. There had to be some other way.In 1962, I made the acquaintance of the American psychologist Abraham Maslow,who had identified what he called ‘peak experiences’, feelings of suddenbubbling happiness. Typical was the experience of one of his students who wasworking his way through college as a jazz drummer. One morning, in the earlyhours, he suddenly had a burst of new energy, and found himself drummingperfectly, unable to do a thing wrong.But Maslow believed that such experiences occurred by chance, and that there wasno way of inducing them. I could not wholly accept this view for I had noticedthat peak experiences often occur after a sustained effort, or with suddenrelease of stress, with its surge of relief.One such occasion happened in the mid-60s, when I was driving back from Scotlandwith my family. We had set out from Biggar, in Lanarkshire, and I had assumed wehad a journey of a hundred miles or so to reach the border. After driving forabout an hour, I saw a signpost and realised I had greatly overestimated thedistance; England was only about ten miles ahead. This meant we could easilyreach Leeds, where an old friend lived, and stay the night there.The realisation that I was closer than I thought brought a surge ofcheerfulness, and since it was a sunny morning, I was soon in a mood ofsupercharged optimism. This feeling increased as the great hills of the LakeDistrict came in sight. This had always been one of my favourite places, and Iwas familiar with its geography. But soon I began to experience the oddsensation that I could somehow see through the mountains, to what lay on the farside. I do not mean, of course, that the hills seemed literally transparent; butI felt as if I was a bird who could look down on them from a great height. Thisstate of intensified awareness lasted an hour or more.Maslow discovered that when his students began to discuss their peakexperiences, they began having peak experiences all the time, and this makessense. During the course of an ordinary day, we are constrained by a kind ofnatural caution, an anticipation of possible difficulties and problems, whichtints our consciousness a shade of grey. Talking and thinking about peakexperiences makes us realise how lucky we are, and that we can dispense with thecaution and constraint. It is like realising that you have more money in thebank than you thought – or, in the case of the drive from Scotland, realisingthat the border was closer than I thought, and that I therefore had energy tospare.Still, Maslow would point out that my Lake District experience was a matter ofchance, and I would have to agree. But there was another occasion, in January1979, when I achieved an intensity of experience through deliberate effort.On Saturday 30 December 1978, I had to travel to a village called Sheepwash, inDevon, where I was due to lecture. It was raining when I set out, but as I drovethrough Launceston the rain began to turn to snow. I arrived at the farm calledTotleigh Barton in the late afternoon, and gave my talk to a group of poetrystudents after dinner. That night, as I went to my chalet, the snow was thick onthe ground and still falling. The next morning, it was obvious that I was notgoing to be able to drive back home. I phoned my wife and told her I might bestuck there for several days. That night – New Year’s Eve – the cold froze thewater supply.The next day I tried to get my car up the slope and out to the main road. As thewheels began to spin, the others pushed me. Then we all took shovels and beganthe slow business of clearing the snow to the gate.The narrow country lanes had ditches on either side. If I landed in one of thoseI would be stuck until the rescue services arrived. But with everything deep insnow, it was hard to see where the road ended and the ditch began. I sat forwardin my seat, driving in second gear and staring through the windscreen with totalconcentration.It took about two hours to reach the main Exeter road, where the snow had beenchurned to dirty mud, and there I could relax. I now discovered that the twohours of frantic concentration had induced a state of heightened consciousness.Everything I looked at seemed deeply interesting, as if twice as real as normal,and the cottages I passed seemed to be so fascinating that I almost wanted tostop and look more closely.This state of intensity lasted all the way home, where I found that theelectricity was off, and that my wife had delivered nine puppies in the night bythe light of a torch.The experience proved to me beyond all doubt that Maslow was mistaken. States ofheightened awareness could be induced by sheer concentration.I soon discovered the basic technique. When we are slightly bored, we allow ourinner pressure to leak away. And suddenly it seems obvious that the world is arather dreary place, for when our inner pressure is low, everything looksboring. On the other hand, when we have something to look forward to – even ourfavourite meal at dinnertime – there is something inside us that resists suchleakage. The trick seems to be to induce this state of pleasant anticipation bythe use of imagination, the exercise of inner freedom, even if you have nothingin particular to anticipate.This could be compared to a concert audience awaiting the arrival of theconductor. There is a murmur of conversation; everyone’s attention is focused onsomething different. Then the conductor comes in; the buzz dies away. Everyone’santicipation is suddenly focused in the same direction.What happens in boredom is that we feel there is nothing ‘out there’ that isworth our full attention. But there is a fallacy involved here – a fallacy Ibegan to grasp on that drive back from Sheepwash. Concentrating my attentionbecause I might otherwise land in the ditch generated a certain ‘energy ofattention’. And when I was able to relax on the main road, all this accumulatedenergy made me see that everything is interesting. And this state was sustainedduring the rest of the drive home because I was now aware that the world aroundme was interesting, so that I was looking at it with an eager attention thatgenerated yet more energy. I labelled this state ‘positive feedback’, as opposedto the negative feedback in which boredom generates yet more boredom.It has been the aim of my life to learn to generate ‘positive feedback’ by anact of will."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2> ROMANTIC NIHILISTWhen I was about fourteen, my mother, who was always singularly frank about sex,told me that she knew the moment I was conceived. She and my father, who wasthen nineteen, had been saying goodnight outside the garden gate when theurgency of physical contact had led them to make love in the upright position.My mother felt her knees buckle and almost slid to the ground.This was in late September 1930. Two months later, after missing her secondperiod, she went to the doctor, who verified she was pregnant. They were marriedon Christmas Day.My grandfather had taken aside Frank Tarratt, the boyfriend of my mother’s eldersister Dora, and said: ‘I hope you aren’t getting up to that kind of thing?’Frank looked shocked and assured him that Dora was still a virgin. But one yearlater, Dora and Frank had to marry, and my cousin John soon made his appearance.It seems that my mother’s eldest sister Connie was responsible for her downfall.She had become engaged to an optician named Frank Carlyle, who was a widower.Together with my mother, they had been invited to stay with Aunt Ethel, wholived near Doncaster. Frank and my father were assigned to one double bed,Connie and my mother to the one in the next room. Halfway through the night,Connie went and climbed into Frank’s bed, and my father had no alternative thanto replace him in the other.My mother, whose name was Anetta (but whom everybody called Hattie), told me allthis when I was about ten years old. She also confided to me that Aunt Ethel wasnot really my aunt, but a friend of my grandmother’s who had got herselfpregnant, and been taken in by a kindly relative. Although Ethel had married andmoved to Doncaster, she remained a close friend of the family.All this talk of unmarried pregnancies shocked me, not because I was a prude (atten I was indifferent to the moral issue), but because it seemed such adisastrous thing to happen. I swore that it would never happen to me, and whenit actually did – some nine years later – I felt there was a kind ofinevitability about it.My mother did not particularly enjoy being married, any more than my father did.Like most working-class people, they simply made the best of it. My dad (Ialways called him Dad, and it sounds more natural than ‘my father’) liked hisbeer, and spent most of his evenings in the pub. My mother stayed home andlooked after the children – I was soon joined by my brother Barry – and readTrue Romance magazines and library books. Dad was bad-tempered and irritable –no doubt resentful at being forced into marriage and having to spend his life ata factory bench – and we all breathed a sigh of relief when he went off to thepub. He was a hard worker and a good breadwinner, but working a forty-eight hourweek must have struck him as a poor substitute for living.I was a bright and – as my photographs show – rather a pretty child, and wasalways regarded as the clever one of the family. Cousin John was also cleverand, being an only child for many years, rather spoilt. His father Frank turnedout to be rather odd; he used to slap Dora around, suspecting her of infidelity,and slept with a knife under his pillow.My father never hit my mother, although they often quarrelled, for my mother wasalso a strong character. She confided in me, I think, because she was bored bythe drudgery of working-class life. So while she was doing the ironing, orputting wet clothes through a mangle that screwed on to the sitting-room table,Barry and I would lie on the rug in front of the fire and say: ‘Tell us aboutwhen you were a little girl.’She had been a member of a family of seven, so they were relatively poorcompared to us (with dad’s £3 a week), and her stories of poverty seemedromantic, and made us feel a pleasant sense of having come up in the world.Looking back on a working-class childhood, what strikes me most is that everyonewe knew seemed to accept the situation fate had thrown them into. No one dreamedof escape, because no one thought there was any escape. Instead they contentedthemselves with the pub, and the football match on Saturday afternoon, anddreamed of winning the football pools. And my mother and Aunt Dora, who wereboth readers, devoured library books, and enjoyed writers like D. H. Lawrenceand A. J. Cronin because they often described poverty and the frustration ofintelligent women trapped in working-class life.I naturally followed my mother’s example and read a great deal, often the booksshe had just finished (her plot summaries of Wuthering Heights and Sons andLovers made them easier to absorb). I had taught myself to read from comics likethe Dandy and Beano, then progressed to boys’ papers like Wizard and Hotspur.But I found ‘grown-up’ books more satisfying because I disliked being a child; Iseemed to be devoured by a permanent dissatisfaction.Things began to improve when I was about ten. Uncle Frank Carlyle gave me a bookcalled The Marvels and Mysteries of Science and I became fascinated byastronomy, learning to recognise a dozen or so nebulae at a glance, andmemorising the order of the planets from Mercury to Pluto. Percival Lowell’sspeculation that the canals of Mars might be irrigation channels across itsdeserts led me inevitably to Wells’s War of the Worlds, then on to The TimeMachine and The Invisible Man. There and then I had the first dim inkling of thedesire to be a scientist.My mother gave me a chemistry set for my eleventh birthday in 1942; it was acheap one with a dozen chemicals in drums and a few test tubes. But there was aninstruction book, and I was soon showing Barry how to add two colourless liquidstogether to make bright blue or cloudy orange. It was at this time that I leftjunior school and won a scholarship to a secondary school, where I discovered acoverless copy of Holmyard’s Elementary Chemistry on top of some lockers, andfelt no guilt about stealing it. And after I had read Holmyard, I beganborrowing large leather-bound volumes on chemistry from the public library.During that year when I discovered science, I suddenly felt that an immensepsychological gap had opened between myself and the people around me; I dreamedof a day when, as Wells suggested, men would be like gods.What began to worry me slightly was my own awakening sexual impulse. In spite ofmy mother’s stories, sex had never interested me as a child; I was a ratherpuritanical little boy who felt vaguely disgusted when school-friends told dirtyjokes. One day when I was about ten, I walked with two friends to the fields amile away at Humberstone, and we lay on the grass and drank water from lemonadebottles. Then the others began to talk about girls, and how delightful it mustbe to undress them. Soon they became so excited that they took off theirtrousers, obviously enjoying the feeling of the air on naked flesh. One of themlay on his stomach while the other placed his erect penis in the crack of hisbottom, and began to move it up and down. There was, of course, no thought ofsodomy – their excitement would never have carried them that far. It was simplyan obscure urge, the knowledge that penises could be placed inside girls, andthe desire to play at sex. Their talk of girls caused me to feel sexuallyaroused, but I had no desire to join in the game.I am not, of course, claiming that I was devoid of interest in sex before thattime. At a very early age, before I had ever heard of sex, I used to put on mymother’s knickers when I was alone in the house, and experience a curious thrillat the silky feeling of the rayon against my body. And from then on, the sightof knickers always caused a certain sexual arousal. Many years later, I asked agirlfriend why she thought knickers were sexually stimulating to males and shereplied: ‘Because they’re associated with that part of the body.’ But I am notsure this simple explanation explains anything, since I knew nothing aboutfemale anatomy at the age of three.My own suspicion is that this is not learned behaviour but some kind of instinctthat has somehow been ‘imprinted’ in males in the past century and a half.Knickers (or ‘drawers’) were invented in the mid-nineteenth century, and beganto figure in the pornography of the time. Because they were ‘forbidden’, menwould soon be as excited by a glimpse of a woman’s drawers, which came down toher ankles, as by a glimpse of bare flesh under her skirt.The biologist Rupert Sheldrake believes that new forms of behaviour can betransmitted by what he calls ‘morphic resonance’, which could be regarded as akind of telepathic induction. In an experiment to test whether morphic resonancewas real, children were asked to learn a nursery rhyme in a foreign language,and a piece of ‘verse’ that had been made up. If morphic resonance reallyexisted, they should find it easier to memorise the genuine nursery rhymebecause millions of children already knew it. And that is just what happened. Iam inclined to believe that the male response to knickers has been transmitteddown to us by morphic resonance.By the time I reached adolescence, the tingling in the loins became so powerfulthat it never seemed to go away. I found myself thinking about sex all the time,and glancing into the windows of ladies’ underwear shops and at knickers onclothes-lines.When I was about fourteen, I was lying in bed, thinking about the Frenchmistress, who used to sit with her feet on a desk in the front row – the boy whosat there claimed (probably untruthfully) that he had caught glimpses of herunderwear. As I pressed my hips against the mattress I experienced a sensationof intoxicating sweetness, more intense than anything I had ever felt. I wasamazed to discover that my body possessed this power to generate ecstasy.After this discovery, I came to accept that my body needed relief from sexualtension, and was glad when masturbation had relieved me of the desire so I couldgive my full attention to science. But the tingling in the loins returned sooften that I sometimes masturbated seven times a day.Shaw claims in one of his prefaces that his only teenage sexual experience was‘the involuntary emissions of dreams’, which seems to confirm the speculation ofsome of his critics that he was sexually cold. As to me, I suspect that Iinherited my lively sexuality from my father – my mother once hinted that hissexual demands were fairly continuous – so the six-year period from thirteen tonineteen, when my sexual experience was purely imaginary, seemed to last forever, and I longed for the experience of penetrating a girl. In theseimaginative seductions, I never began by conjuring up a naked girl, but bypicturing myself lying on top of a girl wearing rayon knickers, and rubbing mypenis against her until I reached orgasm.I read somewhere the statistic that adolescent boys think of sex every quarterof an hour; in my case this was a gross underestimate. On my way to school, thebus passed an enormous advertisement for Bile Beans, a remedy for constipation,that was illustrated by a picture of a girl in green bra and panties standing ona bathroom scale; I never passed it without staring furtively and licking mylips. Just beyond the advertisement, the bus made a turn past small back yardswith clothes-lines, and I always gazed down intently for any glimpse ofknickers. By the time I was thirteen I was writing my first book. I had bought at a churchbazaar two volumes of a work called Practical Knowledge for All, a kind of homeeducator which included ‘courses’ on every subject from aeronautics andastronomy to philosophy and zoology. And one day during the long August holidayof 1944, I decided to begin a book that would try to summarise all the world’sscientific knowledge in a single small volume. I gave it the title A Manual ofGeneral Science, and began with the subjects I knew best, physics and chemistry.I soon filled that volume, and had to buy a second notebook.Carried away by the sheer pleasure of writing, as exhilarating as freewheelingdownhill on a bicycle, I decided to venture into subjects I knew nothing about,like geology and biology, and found this experience so enjoyable that I simplycarried on scribbling, even when the holidays were over. I had never been sohappy in my life. I had discovered the sheer immensity of the world of ideas,which seemed to stretch, like some marvellous unknown country, to limitlesshorizons. Every day, when I started writing, I felt like an explorer preparingto discover new lakes and forests and mountain ranges. I felt sorry for theother boys at school, who were ignorant of this magical kingdom where I spent myevenings and weekends.I even wrote a section on philosophy, from Plato to Berkeley and Hume. I lovedexplaining to school-friends Berkeley’s argument that the external world isunreal, and might vanish if there were no human beings to see it.Having finished the book – or rather, given it up, as I realised I could go onfor ever – I set myself a new project, and spent the next school holiday tryingto read all the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, Marlowe, Jonson,Middleton, Webster and the rest. During another holiday I read works by all themajor Russian writers – Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Gogol, Aksakov, Chekhov. Later Iturned to the history of art, and discovered Van Gogh, Gauguin and Cézanne.In 1946, when I was fifteen, I switched on the radio one night to the BBC’s newThird Programme, and found myself listening to the third act of Shaw’s Man andSuperman. In the previous year I had seen the film of Caesar and Cleopatra, andthought it an impressive historical extravaganza, but felt no desire to exploreShaw’s other work. But this third act of Man and Superman – Don Juan in Hell –left me stunned, and convinced that Shaw was the greatest playwright sinceShakespeare.The scene is a discussion between Don Juan, Mozart’s Commendatore, his daughterDoña Ana, and the Devil. Doña Ana has just died and, finding herself in Hell, isindignant. Was she not a faithful daughter of the Church? Don Juan explains thatHell is not a place of torment, but of endless pleasure, and that he finds itthoroughly boring. Her father joins them, and explains to her that heaven is themost beatifically boring place in the universe, and that all the best peopleprefer Hell, including the fathers of the Church. Then the Devil arrives, andexplains that he stands for love, beauty and warmth of heart, and organised thisplace to epitomise them. Don Juan then describes his own view of the purpose ofevolution: the creation of the Superman.What impressed me so much was that Shaw is asking: what is the purpose of life?It was the first time that I had heard anyone ask the question that had hauntedme since the age of thirteen. Wells had written a little book called What Are WeTo Do With Our Lives?, but it was basically about politics and sociology. Shawobviously understood the basic problem: meaninglessness.Yet Shaw’s answer: that the purpose of life is to understand itself, failed tosatisfy me. How could that supply an answer to the question of good and evil,right and wrong?So at the age of sixteen, when it was time for me to leave school, I had nostrong sense of purpose. Worse still, I was suffering from that typical problemof teenagers: boredom and futility. I spent a great deal of my time experiencinga complete lack of motivation. On a hot Saturday afternoon I would go for a walkin the park, and feel like an alien from Mars, looking at a world that meantnothing to me.One July day, when I had been reading too much in the hot sun (it was a gloomybook on Russian literature) I went into the kitchen to switch on the stove, andhad a blackout. I stood holding on to the stove, and felt my mind swept awaycompletely, and with it all I knew as my identity. When my sight cleared, I wasoverwhelmed with horror. Through all the hatred and distrust of the world I hadat least been certain of one thing – my own existence. But in the blackout I hadfelt my existence taken away from me as simply as you might take a sweet awayfrom a baby. Suddenly, I wanted badly to know who I was, if I could still existwhen my identity slipped away. I understood what Eliot meant when he spoke aboutthe mind under ether being ‘conscious, but conscious of nothing’. What I seemedto have been conscious of in the blackout was a kind of electrical flow of painin the nothingness. Later, I wrote in my journal that life is not a movementtowards something, but an escape from something – from some ultimate pain on theother side of existence. For days, after this experience, the world became anabsurdity; watching it was like listening to a foreign language. What made itworse was that I could not feel: ‘This is frightful’, or ‘This is a tragedy.’ Itsimply negated every possible human value and therefore every human description.I felt as if I should not be alive.This is why I read so much. I knew that, with luck, a book would draw me into itand excite a feeling of being alive. So I ploughed my way through gloomyRussians like Goncharov – I felt Oblomov was my first cousin – andSaltykov-Schedrin and Zamyatin, and read Ulysses for the fifth time. (When,years later, I met my first publisher, Victor Gollancz, he asked me: ‘How onearth have you managed to read so much?’ and I answered ‘Boredom’.)In fact, I glimpsed the solution in that preface that Constance Garnett used inall her translations of Dostoevsky: his description (in a letter to his brotherMikhail) of how he and other condemned ‘revolutionaries’ were taken out on toSemyonovsky Square in St Petersburg to be executed by firing squad. ‘They barkedorders over our heads, and made us put on the white shirts worn by personscondemned to execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only a fewminutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones, and I contrivedto kiss Plescheiv and Dourov, who were next to me, to bid them farewell.Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, and we were unbound, brought back to thescaffold, and informed that his Majesty … had spared our lives.’ One of hisfellow-prisoners went insane. It struck me that if Dostoevsky had been offeredhis freedom on condition that he promised never to be bored for the rest of hislife, he would have accepted gladly, and been quite certain that he could carryout his promise.I again saw the answer in Boswell’s life of Johnson – which I bought myself forChristmas – when Johnson remarks: ‘When a man knows he is to be hanged in afortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.’ That was obviously what waswrong with my mind – lack of a sense of urgency. But how could you generate afeeling of urgency when your whole life lacked direction?My only salvation obviously lay in becoming a writer. In the year as a labassistant I had written a sequel to Man and Superman called Father and Son, inwhich Shaw’s hero Tanner finds himself father of a son who shares none of hisbelief in socialism, and who feels that the evolutionism of Man and Supermanstill fails to address the question of whether life is an absurd joke.It was shortly before this that I came upon a discovery that put an end to thenihilism and the suspicion that life was a malicious joke. In the SelectedEssays of T. S. Eliot I had come upon a reference to the Hindu religiousclassic, the Bhagavad Gita. Since Eliot was my main literary guide – I readevery book he mentioned – I immediately bought a copy of the book when I saw anew translation – by Isherwood and Prabhavananda – in our local bookshop.It is a small extract from the vast Hindu epic The Mahabharata. Its hero,Arjuna, is told that he must fight against an army that includes kinsmen, and heis horrified at the thought that he might kill some of his own family. Histeacher, Krishna, the incarnation of God, tells him that his misery isunnecessary. ‘There never was a time when you did not exist, nor I, nor any ofthese princes, nor is there any time when we shall cease to be. Worn-out clothesare shed by the body; worn-out bodies are shed by the soul, like garments.’Krishna then goes on to teach Arjuna the essence of the religious life. Althoughwe are obliged to live in the world, it is important to refuse to become theslave of desire. We must learn to practise non-attachment. Human beings spendtheir lives tangled in a web of illusions, of Maya, and this is the cause of alltheir unhappiness. We must recognise them as illusions, and refuse to allow themto gain power over us.This can be done by teaching yourself to meditate and to recognise that ‘you’are not your body, or your emotions, or even your mind. The essence of yourbeing is identical with Brahman, the power behind the universe, the reality thatcreates this web of unreality …I was a frustrated teenager, continually tormented by desires and emotions. TheGita taught me to grasp the knowledge that my soul, the Atman, is of the samenature as Brahman. It brought a tremendous sense of relief. When I was tormentedby embarrassment – as teenagers are most of the time – or a feeling ofhumiliation, I simply had to create that sense of looking down on human lifefrom above: > Though a man be the greatest of sinners,> This knowledge will carry him, like a raft> above his sin. So I no longer needed to feel guilty about masturbation, or mortified by socialblunders and errors. I was not an adolescent; my essence was immortal andtimeless.It was an incredible relief. And I soon discovered that ‘meditation’ was not theimportant part of the discipline. Merely sitting, cross-legged, for half anhour, and focusing my mind, brought a sudden feeling of inner control. I wouldstill my mind, then I would concentrate hard, often screwing up my face until Imust have looked like a demon. When, years later, I acquired one of those steelsyphons for making soda water, it reminded me of that mental trick.Concentrating hard was just like screwing the little metal cylinder on to thehollow spike, and hearing the hiss as the carbon dioxide rushed into the waterand made it effervescent. Suddenly my mind was sparkling.So the kind of misery that had brought me to the verge of killing myself nowseemed an absurdity. I would get up in the morning at half past five, and sit onthe floor of my bedroom repeating: > Brahman is the ritual> Brahman is the offering> Brahman is he who offers> To the fire that is Brahman> When a man sees Brahman in every action> He shall find Brahman. Then I would put on running kit, and go for a jog around the park before settingoff to my job as a lab assistant, walking across Spinney Hill Park and throughthe back streets of the slums where I had often visited members of my father’sfamily in childhood. Sometimes I would stop, and simply stare at some crackedwindowsill, aware that anything on which we focus our full attention becomesinteresting. And at the laboratory I became indifferent to the petty nagging ofthe physics master; his stupidity and spite could no longer touch me.It was during this period that I realised I had discovered one of the secrets ofhuman existence: if I maintained a high level of inner pressure, and declined toallow my mind to collapse into tiredness or boredom, everything went well. WhenI didn’t, they went badly. The major problem of human beings is a tendency toallow our energies to leak. And as soon as they leak, consciousness is dimmed,and we become subject to accident. I seemed to have spent years of my teensgoing through life with a continual sense of anxiety, as if anticipating a blow.Now I realised that I caused the blows myself by allowing my inner pressure toescape. All I had to do was to concentrate hard, to set my mouth in a firm lineand clench my jaw, and perhaps stretch my muscles like an animal waking from anap. And as soon as I had induced this feeling of control, problems evaporated. Again it was necessary to look for a job. Ideally, I would have liked to work asa junior reporter for the Leicester Mercury, but they had no openings. TheLabour Exchange sent me instead to the office of the Collector of Taxes, whichwas opposite the Mercury building. I was interviewed by an amiable Londonercalled J. W. Sidford, who quickly divined that I did not have the slightestinterest in becoming a tax collector, but offered me a job that might serve as astopgap until I could make a living by writing.Predictably, the tax job bored me. I had to begin the day by filing Schedule Aforms, after which there was very little to do. Fortunately, Mr Sidford seemedto find me amusing, and often invited me into his office, where we would discussliterature – his favourite author was Howard Spring, who wrote novels aboutManchester working-class life. I escaped to Leicester Central Library around thecorner far more often than I should have done. And I was allowed to read at workwhen there was no filing to be done – it was there I first read War and Peace.That boring first chapter had so far deterred me, but within half a dozenchapters I was living in Tolstoy’s world, carried away – as E. M. Forster says –by the ‘effect like music’.At least my father was pleased; if his friends in the pub asked him what his sonwas doing, he could tell them I was a Civil Servant. So I worked throughout myseventeenth year in the office in Albion Street, and even allowed myself to bepersuaded to take the Civil Service examination, which I passed in the spring of1949. When I was told that I would be posted elsewhere, probably out ofLeicester, I was delighted.This did not last. I arrived at the Collector of Taxes in Rugby at the beginningof an intensely hot summer. This was the home of Rugby School, made famous inTom Brown’s Schooldays, celebrated in the nineteenth century for the regime ofDr Arnold, the father of the poet Matthew. It was also the place where RupertBrooke had grown up – I had come to greatly admire his poetry.But Rugby was a small town, and there was little to do in my spare time butread. My landlady took a dislike to me, finding me too bookish and abstracted,unlike my fellow lodger, who was red-cheeked and outgoing. Finally, she gave menotice. But this turned out to be a piece of excellent luck. I found that therewas a hostel for young men in Rugby, where no one cared when I came and went, orwhat I read. So I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of that summer. But I continued todislike office work, and was overjoyed when a summons arrived to enter the RAFfor my National Service.By the time I took the train to Padgate, in Lancashire, to become an airman Ihad already turned eighteen. I had the worst expectations of military life,since my father had often told me grimly that National Service should knock somesense into me. But it proved pleasanter than I had expected. The flightlieutenant who interviewed me decided I was officer material – by that time Ihad taken some care to get rid of my Midlands accent – but this notion wasdropped when I revealed that my family background was working-class, and therewas not enough money to pay my mess bills. After a week in Padgate, being issuedwith a uniform, I was sent to Bridgnorth, in Shropshire, a picturesque placewith a railway that runs up a cliff. There I did my ‘square-bashing’, startingat half past six in the winter dawn, and I wrote a poem that began: > The sun is a white diamond in the morning> Tearing a pale scar across the sky. The day was long and exhausting, and when I collapsed into bed, I was too tiredto be kept awake by the noise that went on until lights out.After eight weeks of this, there was a passing-out parade, and I was surprisedto experience a surge of sheer delight as several hundred of us snapped toattention, then went through our drill and marched to the sounds of the brassband. It made me realise that we all contain this immense, irrational energy ofjoy, and that our problem is to gain access to it. The insight reinforced what Ihad learned from my ‘suicide attempt’ – that the thin walls of personalityseparate us from an immense world of sheer happiness and affirmation.After that parade, the rest of my career in the RAF was an anticlimax. I hadhoped that I might learn to fly aeroplanes, but was told that I could only dothat if I signed on for five years. My next choice was to become a medicalorderly – I had met one during a brief spell in hospital, and decided that thejob seemed interesting. But I suspect that fate had no intention of allowing meto relax and enjoy life yet. I was assigned to general duties as a clerk, andposted to a run-down camp called Wythall, not far from Birmingham, for training.It was a slovenly, cheerless place, but since I had already taught myself totype, I was allowed to write letters during the typing lessons. It was therethat I read Aldous Huxley’s Antic Hay, which I found exhilarating – I enviedHuxley his early success, and his association with figures like T. S. Eliot andD. H. Lawrence. It made me daydream of weekends in country houses andintellectual discussion that went on until dawn. In Wythall I seemed to be athousand miles away from the kind of life I wanted to lead.I also recall going to see the Graham Greene film The Third Man. As I wasstanding in the queue, a tramp came and asked me for money, and I gave him ashilling. At that moment he noticed a policeman watching us, and hastily handedme a cigarette, so that he could not be arrested for begging. I had never smoked– although both my parents were addicted – and decided to try it. The man nextto me gave me a light, and I puffed away, trying to breathe in the acrid smokewithout coughing. It made the time pass more quickly, but also filled my mouthwith such a bitter taste that I was never subsequently tempted to try another.I had one odd experience at Wythall, which later played a part in getting medischarged from the RAF. When I was billet orderly, I had been placed on acharge for failing to polish the dilapidated, discoloured linoleum to the levelrequired. This involved extra duties in the evening, and one day I was sent topolish the floor of a warrant officer. He seemed a pleasant, friendly person andengaged me in conversation. Then he began to talk about the joys of flogging,and asked if I would tie him up and beat him. The idea did not appeal to me, andI declined as politely as I could, saying I had to report back to the guardroom. The next day I went home for Christmas, and after I came back, wasrelieved to learn that the warrant officer was still on leave.Soon after that, my training over, I was posted again, this time to HucknallTorkard in Nottinghamshire. It was close to the birthplace of D. H. Lawrence,and to Byron’s Newstead Abbey, to which I cycled one rainy January afternoon.But the camp itself was as run-down as Wythall, sunk in a permanent lethargylike a Russian novel. There were soldiers there, as well as airmen and airwomen,and I was transferred to the RAF regiment and assigned to work as the clerk inan auxiliary unit whose members came in for training only at weekends.During the week, it was not unlike being in the tax office, with not enough todo. I remember it mainly through the books I read – William Gaunt’s TheAesthetic Adventure, and the poems of Swinburne and Dowson. I was also studyingFinnegans Wake, using the Skeleton Key of Campbell and Robinson. At that time,Ulysses was reissued, for the first time since the war, and I hastened to buy acopy. I had been reading it since I was sixteen, and knew much of it by heart.Although my first reaction had been disgust and irritation, I soon realised thatthis is a writers’ manual that could teach me the precise science of describingactuality.One week, everything went wrong. Believing the adjutant was on leave, I walkedinto the office late one morning, and my weekend leave was cancelled. On theweekly parade I had been singled out for growing my hair too long, and placed ona charge. And at that time, feeling thoroughly sick of the RAF and itsstupidities, I was reproved by the adjutant for typing a letter badly. He wavedit in front of my nose and shouted: ‘Aren’t you ashamed of yourself.’ Mypatience finally snapped, and I shouted back, ‘No.’He stared at me in astonishment, and so did the corporal and sergeant. Theadjutant told me to go and wait for him in his office.The next step, I could see, would be the guard room and ‘jankers’ (prison). ButI felt reckless and disgusted. I even contemplated throwing the inkwell throughthe glass door when I saw the adjutant’s shadow on it.When he came in, however, the adjutant looked concerned, and asked me in afatherly way what was wrong. I decided to play up to his idea of me as adangerous neurotic, and strode up and down the office denouncing the RAF as astupid Boy Scouts organisation. He asked me what I would prefer to do, and Isaid I would like to be transferred to the Medical Corps. Cheered at theprospect of getting rid of me, he told me to go and see the Medical Officer, andsee if he could be persuaded to sign a certificate stating that I wasemotionally unfitted to be an efficient clerk.The M.O. was a young man, and had obviously received a phone call from theadjutant asking him to try and get me assigned elsewhere. It was plain that hedid not feel that dislike of the RAF was enough to prove my emotionalinstability. But he said he would do what he could. As I started to leave hisoffice, I was thinking hard for some other reason why I should be transferred.Then I had an inspiration. I turned back and said: ‘There is one more thing, sir…’ ‘Yes.’ ‘I’m a homosexual.’The effect was impressive. When I wrote home about the episode, I said: ‘Heseized two pencils in both hands and began writing with both at once.’ With anexpression of deep concern, he told me to sit down and asked how long I hadknown I was homosexual. I said ever since I was fourteen. Then I invented ahistory for myself, based on a homosexual friend called Alan. I said that mymother had wanted a girl, and had intended to call me June. (This happened to betrue.) She had kept me dressed as a girl until I was nine years old. But my daysof active homosexuality had started when I had been seduced by a schoolteachernamed Eric, and discovered I enjoyed it.What was causing me stress at the moment was being surrounded by beautiful malebodies in the billet.The M.O. explained that active homosexuality was a serious offence that couldland me in jail. Which meant that AC2 Wilson might not be allowed to remain inthe RAF.I looked horrified, trying to conceal my delight, and said I hoped not.Back in the office, the adjutant asked me what had happened, and I told him. Hewas obviously fascinated, and made me repeat the most scandalous details severaltimes. Then he told me I could take the rest of the morning off to recover. Icycled out to Newstead Abbey, overwhelmed by an intoxicating sense of freedom.When I got back, the adjutant had another long talk with me, enjoying everymoment of this break from the dull routine, and repeating: ‘But Wilson, I don’tunderstand. There’s nothing like a woman …’The next day there was an unpleasant complication. The adjutant had gone onleave, and I was told that the S.I.B., the Special Investigations Branch of theRAF police, wanted to see me. They wanted to know if I knew other homosexuals inthe camp, and if I had had sexual relations with any of them. Of course,everyone knew the queers – a certain cook, a certain sergeant, even a WAAFofficer – but I wasn’t going to involve any of them. The interrogation went onfor two hours, then I was allowed to go. The next day they sent for me again,and this time tried increasing the pressure. Unless I was willing to name names,they could not guarantee that I wouldn’t spend the rest of my eighteen months injail … Then the officer asked if I had known a Warrant Officer called Rutherfordat Wythall. I admitted I had – this was the man who wanted me to beat him.Rutherford, he said, was now under arrest for sadistic cruelty to a cat, puttingout its eye. If I would give evidence against him at his trial, they would dropthe threats. Apologetically, I once more said I couldn’t do that. I was finallyallowed to go, but told to think it over.The next day the adjutant returned, and I told him what had happened. Heimmediately wrote me out a leave pass, and told me to go home and stay thereuntil contacted.I went home chuckling with delight. I could hardly believe my luck. For the nextfour weeks I returned to Hucknall only to collect my pay. Eventually, I was toldto go to Wendover to see a psychiatrist. He was a large and sympathetic WingCommander, who told me I would probably be discharged from the RAF. A few weekslater a medical board proved to be tougher, obviously suspecting that I wasshamming. I put on a show of mild hysterics, and accused them of treatinghomosexuals like criminals, and they had no alternative but to discharge me."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3> MARYSo six months after entering the RAF I was a civilian once more. The day aftermy discharge I hitch-hiked down to London. A signpost pointing to Wendoverreminded me of Rupert Brooke’s lines: > Thank God that done! and I’ll take the road> Quit of my youth and you,> The Roman road to Wendover> By Tring and Lilly Hoo. Getting out of the RAF was one of the most decisive events of my life. Isuddenly felt, like Wells’s Mr Polly: ‘If you don’t like your life you canchange it’. Until that point I had felt like a football kicked around bydestiny, forced to work at jobs I disliked and swallow boredom and irritation asmy inevitable lot in life. Now one single impulse – the decision to say no – hadchanged everything.In the state of optimism that followed, I turned my back on the Romanticliterature that had formed my staple fare so far. The major influence on mythinking during this period – as strange as it sounds – was Rabelais’s Gargantuaand Pantagruel, which I had stumbled on through reading J. M. Synge’s freetranslation of Ronsard’s lines on Rabelais: > If fruits are fed on any beast> Let vine-roots suck this parish priest,> For while he lived, no summer sun> Went up but he’d a bottle done,> And in the starlight beer and stout > Kept his waistcoat bulging out.> Then Death that changes happy things> Damned his soul to water springs. Gargantua became for me an affirmation of delight in living. This was not theMotteux and Urquhart translation, but that of Jacques LeClerc. I particularlyliked Gargantua’s poem on emptying his bowels: > Whilst I was shitting yesterday, I sniffed> The daily tribute that I owe my tail.> Alas, the odours from my penetrail> Proved quite the worst a human ever whiffed.> O had some power but granted me the gift> Of bringing her I waited for (sweet frail!)Whilst I was shitting> I would have rammed and dammed her water-rift,> Engrossed and settled her estate entail,> Whilst she with skilful fingers would avail,> To guard my nozzle from the turdous drift> Whilst I was shitting. Rabelais was more than a bawdy priest; he was a symbol of ultimate acceptance oflife.My admiration for Synge led me to dream of going to the Aran Isles – the Islandsof the Saints – and trying to find myself some ancient stone hut where I couldspend my days in meditation.One result of this new optimistic state of mind was the determination to resignfrom the Civil Service. I had had enough of offices. But my father washorrified. He felt I was ruining my life. First I had changed my mind aboutbecoming a scientist, and now I was throwing away the chance of becoming aCollector of Taxes. What did I want to do? When I said I wanted to become awriter, he asked me how I thought I was going to go about it, and I had to admitI didn’t know. So he ordered me to leave home.Looking back on it, I have to admit that I never liked my father much. He was aman of strong character and fixed opinions, and my obsession with reading struckhim as unhealthy. One day when I had been using a screwdriver from his tool box,and had forgotten to put it back, he slapped my face, and in that moment I hatedhim. And when I was a teenager, and would listen to plays or symphony concertson the radio, he would come back from the Coleman Road Social Club and mutter,‘Bloody rubbish,’ and change the programme to comedy or a variety show. I sodetested him that, until I had children of my own, it never struck me that anyson could love his father.Meanwhile, I had to decide what to do next. I had a little money from the RAF,but not enough to support me for long. But I was in a bubbling, happy state, andwas sure that whatever happened would be interesting.Synge had wandered around Ireland as a tramp. Why should I not do the same inEngland. I set out from home wearing my old RAF uniform – I found it madehitch-hiking easier – with a haversack on my back. I was carrying one or twofavourite books, including the Bhagavad Gita, Plato’s Symposium and Phaedo andthe collected work of William Blake. My immediate purpose was to see whether Icould find a job as an assistant stage manager in the theatre. Someone hadrecommended that I try the Playhouse in York. But they told me that althoughthey had a vacancy, I would need to pay a premium of a hundred pounds, which wasas far beyond my resources as a hundred thousand. I tried the theatre inHarrogate, but they had nothing to offer. In retrospect, I can see that this wasa piece of good fortune, for if I had become an actor or stage manager, I wouldcertainly have given up the idea of writing books.I went on to visit the Lake District, which I had explored on a bicycle before Iwent into the RAF, but as my money ran low, I decided to return to Leicester tosee if my discharge papers had arrived. My father was not pleased to see me,particularly when I told him I intended to take a labouring job on a buildingsite, but reluctantly he allowed me to stay. Building jobs were easy to obtain,and the employers didn’t care if you only stayed a short time.My workmates were amiable enough, and did not seem surprised that I had decidedto be a labourer – students often worked on sites during the holidays. The onlything I found a strain was the dreary talk about sex. The first question in themorning was who had been ‘on the nest’ the night before. One habitual drunk, whohad been in jail for wife-beating, described how he had made love to his wife,then to his daughter. Another had ten or so children, but still insisted onignoring his wife’s protests and having sex without a condom. I began to feelthat these men had settled for living in the present because they had beenhypnotised by sex.I stayed two weeks, wheeling barrowloads of concrete, and made ten pounds or so.Then I set off to hitch-hike to Southampton, where I hoped to find a boat toIndia – the Gita and various Buddhist scriptures had filled me with the idea ofbecoming a ‘tathagata’, or wanderer there.I also had the romantic idea of spending the night on Stonehenge, which I hadseen pictured in Blake’s Jerusalem. I found that it was surrounded by abarbed-wire fence, which I had to climb over. It had been a warm summer day, butby two o’clock in the morning the temperature had fallen, and my teeth began tochatter. So I made my way to a haystack in the next field and crawled into it. Ihad intended to get up before dawn and watch the sunrise, but I overslept, andwhen I emerged from the stack, found I looked like a teddy bear, with thousandsof little needles of hay stuck into my overcoat.When I saw a signpost to an RAF station, I decided to try and get a freebreakfast, and went to the guard room and explained that I was waiting for mydischarge papers from the RAF, and wanted to find out what had happened to them.In fact, they gave me breakfast and lunch but kept me waiting while the RAFpolice contacted the civil police in Leicester. My mother was upset when apoliceman came to the front door, and told him to send me home immediately.Twenty-four hours later I found myself back at home, where the atmosphere wasstill cool. But at least there was no more talk of throwing me out.It was a hot summer. I worked for a few weeks at another building job and, whenI got tired of that, went back to the Labour Exchange to be directed tosomething else. I no longer felt any conscience about changing my job as oftenas I felt inclined. Why should I be tied to the same dull job until I felt boredand exhausted? I was sent to a fairground that had opened on the edge ofLeicester, where I had to sell tickets on a gambling machine called a ‘spinner’.A lighted beam would spin around to music, and bulbs would flash on and off overa bank of numbers. When the machine stopped, the illuminated number won a prize.My job was to walk around the circular booth shouting invitations to thepassers-by.I was so good at this that my boss offered me a permanent job, and I was tempted– a life that involved continual change sounded perfect. But it was not to be. Iwas literally seduced away from this life as a wandering showman.One evening, a girl who looked about twelve stood staring at me, and when Iasked her if she wanted to buy a ticket, said: ‘Do you want to sell yourself?’She had a pretty oval face and a cold sore on her lip. She waited for me until Ifinished work, then I walked her home – a few streets away – and kissed hergoodnight. Her name was Mary, and I realised from the way she gazed at me thatshe offered me the prospect of finally losing my virginity. We arranged to meetthe following afternoon – she was an assistant at Woolworths, and Thursday washer afternoon off – and take a bus out to Swithland Woods. It would have to be ashort afternoon, since I was due at work at six.It turned out that Mary was nearly sixteen, and lived on a slum estate nearGypsy Lane. She spoke with a broad Leicester accent, in which ‘bum’ ispronounced ‘boom’ and ‘get out’ ‘gerrout’. She was easy to talk to, being a bornchatterbox, and in the depths of the woods we found a grassy space and lay downand kissed. I was startled and pleasantly surprised when she inserted her tonguebetween my lips, a mode of kissing I had never experienced. I moved away fromher in case she noticed my sexual excitement, but she could undoubtedly deduceit from the pounding of my heart.Finally, we went to a cottage that advertised afternoon teas, and had a pot oftea and buttered scones. By the time we reached the bus stop, we found that wehad missed the six o’clock bus, and had an hour and a half to wait. I wasobviously going to miss the fairground job, but it seemed worth it. As we hadwalked back to the bus, with my arm round her waist, she had taken my hand andplaced it on her small flat breast beneath her thin blouse.It was becoming dark as we kissed goodnight on the corner of her street. Shekissed me with her tongue, grinding her pelvis against my erection. And as Iwalked home, I knew that my curiosity about sex was soon going to be satisfied.The next morning I went to the fairground, and was told I was sacked. I took abus to the centre of town and went to see Mary in Woolworths. She lookedharassed and miserable, and told me that her parents had thrown her out forbeing home after dark. She had tried to catch me up, but failed, and had endedby knocking on a door in Coleman Road – not far from my home – to ask if theyknew where I lived. A kindly bus conductress had given her a bed for the night.And now, as we sat in a cheap cafe, she asked me if I would be willing to marryher.The thought made my heart sink – the last thing I wanted was a teenage wife. Butsince I had been to blame for her present predicament, I said I would. First Iwould go to her home and talk to her mother.She proved to be a short lady with large breasts and few teeth, and the sittingroom she asked me into was furnished with wooden boxes instead of chairs. Ifound something very sensible and likeable about her, and could see why Mary wasso fond of her. She told me indignantly that her husband had had no right tothrow Mary out, and said I was to order her to return home immediately.That was a huge relief – I had already envisaged myself working in an office andliving with Mary in lodgings. Now I hurried back to Woolworths and told Mary,who was overjoyed. And I was overjoyed to feel that my world of poetry and musicand philosophy had been restored to me.It was necessary to find another job immediately, and again I took one on abuilding site, starting the next day. And that evening, Mary and I took a busout to Evington Village, where there was a common. As we sat kissing, and Ibecame feverishly excited, she reached down, squeezed my erection through mytrousers, then, to my delight and incredulity, unbuttoned me and took my penisin her hand. I found it amazing that a fifteen-year-old girl was not afraid tomake the first advances, but deeply relieved – it would have taken me a month toovercome my inhibitions. Since she was sitting down and wearing slacks(cherry-coloured), it would have been impossible for me to attempt any response.We took the bus home, and she kept my hand tightly pressed into her lap.The next day was a Saturday, and we went for a walk in Humberstone Park.Unfortunately, this was flat and offered no kind of shelter. We sat among somespaced trees and kissed, and when she squeezed me through my trousers, I managedto slip my hand under her dress. Then some people went past, and I had tohastily remove it.The following day we had agreed to meet early and go into the country. I alreadyknew what was bound to happen. We caught a bus to Scraptoft village, then walkedon into the green countryside, where the temperature was already in the sixties,with my hand on her breast.We went into a field, and unpacked our sandwiches and orange cordial. But thefarmer ordered us to move on. We walked a quarter of a mile, found another fieldwith a stream that flowed through a grassy dell, and this time made sure we wereno longer within sight of the road. We put the bottles in the stream to cool,then lost no time in lying down.As soon as we began to kiss, she unbuttoned my khaki shorts and examined mypenis. For some reason, its underside was covered in tiny spots, and shechristened it ‘spotted Oscar’. I did what I had dreamed of so often, and reachedup her skirt and inside her knickers, but she had to take my hand and push itfurther back – so great was my ignorance of female anatomy that I supposed thevagina to be the fold of flesh that as a child I had glimpsed in small girls atbathtime. It came as a surprise, and a slight disappointment, since all thesexual fantasies of my teens had involved entering at the front of the body,over the pelvis, and my imagination had to be readjusted. When I inserted afinger she sighed and pushed her tongue into my mouth.The time had obviously come for us to curtail these frustrating explorations,and she gasped, ‘Shall I take them off?’ And she knelt on the ground, pushingdown her cotton schoolgirl knickers, repeating gleefully: ‘Aren’t we wicked?’I was not sure what came next, and clumsily tried to mount her. But she told meto lie on my back, took my penis firmly in her hand, and sat astride me, holdingit with one hand behind her, and the other pulling down her vest, since she hada fruit rash of which she was ashamed. Then she sat carefully down on me, givinga cry of pain as the head penetrated her, and with more gasps of discomfort,went on pressing down until she was sitting on my thighs.I found it hard to believe that this is what I had imagined so often. Where wasthe ecstasy, the surge of intoxication? This felt as clinical as having a cutfinger bandaged.When I tried to move she groaned, ‘Hold still.’ Then she began to move up anddown very slowly and cautiously until I said, ‘Move off, quick,’ and she raisedherself and looked down curiously at the semen bubbling out and rolling towardsmy stomach.After that we ate our sandwiches and drank lemonade. I found it hard to believethat it had all been so down-to-earth. Was this the reality behind all thosefeverish daydreams?We made love again, this time in the normal position, and I had to put my handsunder her buttocks to raise her. Her reactions to lovemaking were gratifying;she gasped, her eyes rolled, and she wriggled and moaned, apparently unconsciousof anything but the pleasure in her loins. Again, I had to withdraw quickly. Asshe stood up and pulled on her knickers, bracing her legs apart, I observed thatmy sexual response – if not the capability to satisfy it – returned immediately.And half an hour later we were making love again.Now, suddenly, I realised that I was beginning to understand one of the basicfeatures of sex: that it depended to a large extent on visual stimulus. Twoyears before, I had been cycling along this road, and passed two women, one ofthem lying with her hands behind her head and her legs apart, showing herknickers. I felt as if a mine had exploded under my bicycle. But the actualityof lovemaking meant that the only sense involved was the sense of touch, so allthe frenzied excitement was absent. Real lovemaking, the lovemaking I haddreamed about for years, would require a sense of reality that made the visualstimulus unnecessary. I would one day label this sense ‘Faculty X’.And as we went on to make love five times more, I noted that as the desirebecame increasingly diluted I was maintaining my excitement by telling myselfthat I was inside her. It seemed that actual sex was more like masturbation thanI had expected.An interesting thought occurred. Now I knew that sex was this practicalactivity, no more intrinsically exciting than eating a sandwich, would I be ableto turn my back on it, like a monk? After all, if we have been to some placethat we always wanted to visit, the curiosity is satisfied, and more often thannot, it hardly matters if we never go there again.But as we walked back to the bus stop in the late afternoon, with the faintsmell of cow dung on the breeze, and her head on my shoulder, I had other thingsto think about. Mary had returned to the subject of marriage, and I had toexplain that if I intended to become a writer, a wife and family would have towait.Another problem nagged at my mind: was it possible she was pregnant? I hadwithdrawn each time, but had read somewhere that sperm cells are incrediblyhardy, and can travel the equivalent of dozens of miles to reach theirobjective. This was a depressing thought. Meanwhile Mary was daydreaming aloudabout how nice it would be to live in London as the wife of a famous writer, andher mother somewhere nearby.To tell the truth, I was tired of all this loving and kissing. I wanted to getback home and write in my journal, and then sit cross-legged on the floor andconcentrate.It seemed that Mary was not a virgin; she told me she had been raped on the‘recky’ (recreation ground) by two boys when she was thirteen. This experiencehad not, as might have been expected, put her off sex; in fact, the contraryseemed true, and her sexual urge was clearly as strong as my own. If it had beensocially permissible I think she would have unbuttoned the trousers of everyattractive male to inspect his endowment.The affair soon settled into a kind of routine. On Saturday evenings I would goto babysit at the house of Uncle George and Aunt Muriel, near Humberstone Park.As soon as we were alone, we would take off our clothes and make love on therug. Now her strawberry rash had gone she was no longer embarrassed to let mesee her naked. She had a beautiful little body with tiny breasts, too small fora bra, and she soon got rid of her schoolgirl knickers and began wearinggrown-up nylon panties.Something else became clear: that nature has baited the sexual hook with acurious kind of honey that is a mild and addictive poison; its taste fills uswith a bubbling sense of exultant indecency, so the mind begins to look aroundfor something that will satisfy this appetite for the forbidden. It was amusingto reflect that even vicars would feel no desire for their wives without thistouch of wickedness.I soon had my answer to the question of whether I could rid myself of sexualdesire now I knew the reality of sex. One day when we had finished lovemaking,Mary pulled on her pink knickers, and looked so desirable that I instantlyremoved them to start all over again. This was clearly absurd. The visualstimulus was obviously about ten times as powerful as the physical sex urgeitself.After lovemaking I had a pleasant sense of relaxation and freedom from desire.But I only had to catch a glimpse of a girl whose panties made a V-shape througha tight dress to feel the desire once more.It seemed to be a kind of swindle. I knew that if I could persuade the girl intobed, I would feel the same dissatisfaction once it was over. In other words,fate had taught me that sex was an illusion, but my loins disagreed. Like achild that wants to put a coloured toy into its mouth, my body simply refused tolearn from experience.When I grew bored with working on the building site, I asked the Labour Exchangewhat they could offer me. They suggested that I might become an agriculturalstudent and work on farms, for which I would be paid a grant under a governmenttraining scheme. It sounded worth trying, so I went to the village of NewboldVerdon, where the squire wanted a farming assistant. I learned to milk the cowsat six in the morning and shovel the dung into a wheelbarrow and dump it on aheap. After breakfast there would be haymaking. This was the kind of life Iloved reading about in poetry but, as with lovemaking, the reality was too real,too solid. After a short time, the squire realised I was not a committed farmingstudent – ‘You’re doing this for a lark, aren’t you?’ – and sent me back to theLabour Exchange.I had two more farming jobs, the second at Houghton-on-the-Hill, which was closeenough for me to be able to commute to work by bus. I was replacing a farmlabourer who had been caught practising animal husbandry with a cow. But the oldproblem was still there. I simply didn’t want to do this kind of thing. I felt Iwas marking time.The affair with Mary went on pleasantly, the only problem being that she wouldbe carried away by moods of violent emotion like summer storms. Perhaps she feltinsecure, or perhaps her temperament required sudden outbursts of emotion toclear the air. Whatever the reason, she would suddenly take offence at somethingI had said quite innocently, and quarrel or burst into tears.She was also prone to explosions of amusement when she would laugh helplessly,and make everybody around her laugh. One day, an old Gypsy woman stopped us inthe street and asked me to buy some trinket or other. She wanted far more thanit was worth, but I gave her what she asked. I commented to Mary, ‘She cheatedus, of course,’ then added, ‘God bless her – we’ve all got to live.’ The wordsstruck Mary as uproariously funny, and she screamed with laughter for fiveminutes.We made love at every opportunity, but with nowhere to go these were few. On oneoccasion when I took her to my home, we found the house empty and retiredupstairs – the first time we had actually made love in a bed. My brother Barrycame back and we had to get up and dress hastily. Before the end of that summerwe had two pregnancy scares, and each time I realised I was tempting fate. I hadno intention of marrying her, but if we kept on like this, we would end upgetting married by force of habit.So I went and had my photograph taken, and sent off for a passport. Then I gavemy notice at the Houghton farm. I was surprised that I felt so sad about it as Imade my way to the bus stop on my last day. I had finally begun to enjoyfarming, and working in the open air. But if I wanted to write for a living, Ihad to find some way of life that would carry me in the right direction.Mary cried a great deal when I told her what I intended to do, so I decided totake her on a farewell holiday to the Lake District. It was not a wise decisionbecause it meant spending the little money I had saved. As it was we had tohitch-hike, and stay in youth hostels. But I felt grateful to Mary. She hadchanged my life, and I felt a different person. The world-weary romantic hadvanished and been replaced by a realist.I remember a windy hillside in Derbyshire where we made love sitting against atree, since the hill was too steep for any other position. Then we went to thetop of a tower, and the wind blew away my beret. It began to rain heavily, andwe took shelter in a wood, and lay under a ground-sheet cape, listening to therain drumming against it. Finally, walking down the hill, with leaves flyingpast us, carried along like ships in full canvas, and looking across at thegreat circle of hills on the edge of Lancashire, I was overwhelmed with aconsciousness of power and freedom, with a sense that made the boredom of myteens seem negligible. I knew at that moment that I had discovered a secret:never quietly to accept boredom and unfulfilment. ‘If you don’t like your life,you can change it …’ With a knowledge of this secret, I felt the future couldhold nothing but triumph, and that whatever happened, I would somehow surviveit.Mary was overwhelmed by the beauty of the lakes, and kept saying: ‘Oh, I wish memam was here.’ I could see that she somehow felt it was all unreal unless shehad her mother to share it with. I felt very protective about her, and sorry forher. But I knew that marrying her would be a disaster, and that if I stayed anylonger, these silken threads would end by wrapping me up into a cocoon.Back in Leicester there were tearful goodbyes and last-minute sex, and Maryswore she would wait for me for ever. Then, with half a crown borrowed from mymother in my pocket, I set out for Dover.My first stop was the home of a homosexual friend in Northampton. His name wasJackie Shepherd, and I had met him through Alan – the friend whose story I hadadapted to escape the RAF. He was as infatuated with me as Mary was, but since Ihave no homosexual tendencies, there was nothing I could do about that. To makethings worse, his parents, who had no suspicion of his tastes, put us in adouble bed together. I liked him, and wished I had been bisexual, just to obligehim. But it was no use.The next day he took me to a birthday party in the home of friends – a twinbrother and sister, both incredibly good-looking and sophisticated. There I meta plump, soft-skinned, very pretty girl called Marion, and the attractionbetween us was immediate and strong. We met again the next day in the home ofanother acquaintance. I had not forgotten Mary, but the realisation that Marionwas also ensnared tempted me to stay on in Northampton and find a job. TheSirens were singing again, and even more sweetly than in Leicester. But I knewit would be foolish to tempt fate. So I set out again the next day, feelingrather like the hero of some musical comedy who has just said goodbye to hislifelong love.Fortunately, Jackie decided to come with me as far as Dover, for I had no moneyleft. He was able to support us for a few days, until we found work nearCanterbury as hop pickers. The farmer provided a tin hut with straw beds. Sincewe had only two blankets, we had to sleep together, and Jackie became a nuisancebecause he would wake up before dawn in an amorous mood, and I had to curseindignantly to be allowed to go back to sleep.Bored with unaccustomed physical labour, Jackie returned to Northampton. At thatpoint, my friend Alan – the homosexual from Leicester – joined me, and we foundwork apple-picking at Marden, in Kent. But he and I could never get along forvery long. He was an aesthete who read Proust over and over again, while I hadGargantua and Pantagruel in my haversack. Possibly I produced in him the samefrustration I produced in Jackie. At all events, we quarrelled, and he crossedthe Channel and – I discovered later – met a rich male friend who took him on toRome.I found myself a job picking potatoes, and the farmer let me sleep on the firstfloor of a ruined cottage – the downstairs was full of potatoes – but since halfthe floor was missing, I had to take care not to roll over in the night. Thisjob paid me enough money for my fare across the Channel, with about a pound tospare.I must admit that I did not enjoy being in this homeless state. I love my homecomforts. Wandering around like this was like a chilly wind that brought acontinual sense of unease. I came to the conclusion that I didn’t much likephysical reality.France seemed very strange – I can still remember its raw impact, the flat, dullarea around the Calais docks, the tramlines, the bomb-damaged houses, thecobbled streets. The map showed me that it was a long way to Strasbourg, where Ihoped to stay with a penfriend, Willi Schwiscka, in return for a holiday he hadspent with us two years before.I went into a shop and bought a long loaf of French bread, a bottle of red wine(it cost a hundred francs – there were a thousand to the pound) and some onions,and ate my first meal in France sitting by the side of one of those longtree-lined roads, with flat countryside stretching all around. I had nevertasted wine before – except port – and wondered why it tasted so sour. Then,with a series of lifts, I managed to get to Lille, where there was a youthhostel. I had left my Nonesuch edition of Blake in the back of a van that gaveme a lift; it seemed a bad beginning.I had a curious adventure in Lille. There were two English girls in the hostel,typists from a bank in Redditch; their names were Wendy and Jean. As I wascooking my breakfast the next morning, they approached me and asked me what Iwas doing that day. I said I was going on to Strasbourg. They explained that aFrenchman had offered to show them the town, but he struck them as a suspiciouscharacter; would I go with them? It was hard to refuse; I decided to spend anextra day in Lille. The Frenchman called himself Michel de Ryoveur, andexplained that he came of an old and aristocratic family – this should havealerted me, for he looked distinctly unaristocratic.He was interested in Jean, so I was left to accompany Wendy. Before the end ofthe day, Michel was walking with his arm around Jean’s waist and kissing her inthe bushes; Wendy obviously expected me to do the same; so, although I was notparticularly interested in her, I obediently put my arm round her and kissed herin the bushes. Later, at the hostel, as we sat on the steps in the dark, shesaid: ‘Why don’t you come to Paris? I shall miss you.’ ‘Will you?’ I wasastonished. The idea that she could be emotionally involved with me after a fewhours seemed absurd; but she assured me she was. Then I thought of the fewfrancs I had left in my wallet, and explained that I had to get on toStrasbourg.We had breakfast together the next morning. ‘Come and see us off, anyway?’ saidWendy. Michel knew a truck drivers’ café, where they could find a lift all theway to Paris. We went there – it was on the outskirts of Lille – and after tenminutes, Michel came out with a truck driver. ‘He will take you.’ I kissedWendy, and Michel kissed Jean. The girls climbed in. Then Michel slapped me onthe shoulder. ‘We go too, huh?’ ‘But I have no kit – it’s all at the hostel.’‘Never mind – we come back tomorrow.’ ‘I have no money.’ ‘I will lend you some –I have a sister in Paris.’We climbed in, to the truck driver’s astonishment. It was an exhausting trip.The truck broke down after dark; finally, we managed to get another lift. Wearrived in the Place de l’Opéra at about two in the morning, all very tired andin low spirits. Michel decided we would sleep at the police station, so we wentin and explained our situation. I was a little puzzled about the way Michelbehaved with the police. He told them he was an American, and spoke French withwhat he evidently considered an American accent. None the less, they let ussleep in a cell. It had no bed – only a big, hard table. All four of us slept onthis, covered with our coats. And at six o’clock, the police woke us up, and wewent out into the cold Paris dawn, and looked at the globes burning down theAvenue de l’Opéra, and wondered where we could find coffee.I suggested we find Michel’s sister, but he now became very evasive. Instead, heinsisted on dragging us around the Louvre and Jeu de Paume. We were allexhausted and getting bad-tempered. Finally, when Michel disappeared into apissoir, Jean said to me: ‘For God’s sake take him away – he’s driving us mad!’He had apparently decided he was in love with Jean and wanted to marry her, andwas plaguing her with all sorts of insane schemes. When Michel came back, Isaid: ‘I’m going back to Lille this afternoon. The girls want you to come too.’He shed some tears, but finally agreed to come.The trip back to Lille was much worse than the trip to Paris. We spent a greatdeal of time walking through the dark in the rain. Michel came back with me tothe hostel – and then vanished. The mère de l’auberge was furious; he had goneoff without paying his bill. But he had good reason. The next morning, thepolice came searching for him. He had been working for a hire-purchase company,and had absconded with a large amount of money. His name, of course, was not deRyoveur – in fact, it was Maréchal.By this time, I was in no condition to care much. I had caught the worst cold ofmy life; my head rang, my throat burned and my eyes streamed. Unfortunately, Ihad no money – not only for food, but to pay my hostel bill. Luckily, otherguests left their provisions in cupboards in the kitchen, and I managed byhelping myself cautiously to small amounts from everything. To make it worse, apostcard came from Wendy, begging me to rejoin them in Paris, and signed: ‘Yourlonely Wendy’. She was staying at the youth hostel at Porte de Châtillon.Suddenly, Strasbourg no longer seemed important. I explained to the mère aubthat I had no money, but that I would send it as soon as I got to Strasbourg,and I left some shoes as security. Then I set out for Paris again.It was hopeless. My head was spinning, and my legs felt strange. There were nolifts, and an hour after dark it began to rain again. I crossed the road andhitch-hiked back to Lille. A kindly Frenchman saw I was in a fever, took me intoa café, and insisted that I drink two brandies with hot coffee. Then he took meback to the hostel. That night, I perspired as I had never perspired in my life.But when I woke up in the morning, the fever had gone; I just felt very weak. Itwas sunny, and my ‘lonely Wendy’ was waiting for me.Once again, I packed my bag. I had made the acquaintance of a travellingsalesman in the hostel, a short, handsome man with a crew cut and a Clark Gablemoustache. I asked him if he could lend me any money. He said he hadn’t much – ahundred francs was all he could spare. But he gave me his address in Paris. Atone point on the road, I found trees loaded with small but sweet apples. Ifilled my knapsack and a spare bag with them, and the pockets of my RAFovercoat. For the next few days, these were the main item of my diet.I was in Paris by evening, and took the métro to Porte de Châtillon. I tried toimagine Wendy’s face when she saw me – delight, astonishment (I hadn’t told herI was coming) – or would she be shy and undemonstrative?She was neither: only irritated. During the past few days she had met a tallNorwegian, and when I saw her, she had her arm round his waist. Clearly, therewas no point in reproaches; they were on holiday, and they intended to enjoythemselves. I shrugged my shoulders and tried not to brood on it. I had otherproblems: no money, and no bed – the hostel was full, and people were sleepingon the floor in sleeping bags. (Wendy was sharing the Norwegian’s.)But at this point, there was a slight improvement in my luck. An Americanreceived a telegram and had to leave suddenly; I asked him not to notify thewarden, and so was able to sleep in his bed. Since I was not signed in, Imanaged to slip out of the hostel the next day without paying. I did not saygoodbye to Wendy.It was a dull day, and the wind was blowing the leaves from the trees in theAvenue de Châtillon. I have never been prone to self-pity, and I was determinednot to give way to it at this point; but I had a feeling that the memory ofWendy was going to sneak up and take me unawares when I was thinking of otherthings, and give me a few days of twinges like toothache.At that moment, an interesting thing happened. The sun came out and shone on thetrees opposite. I was suddenly struck by the beauty of their foliage. Thethought arose: they are here whether I am here or not; and I saw myselfdetachedly, as if looking at myself from an aeroplane, a limited human being,wrestling with transitory emotions as if they were all that mattered. I felt arush of delight, and a desire to laugh, and I knew that this sudden happinesshad tossed Wendy out of my mind. It was true. She never gave me another twinge.The address of Claude Guillaume, the kindly Frenchman who had lent me a hundredfrancs in Lille, was in the rue Bayen, near the Étoile. When I knocked on thedoor, it was opened by one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen, withtranslucent skin and lovely eyes. This was Claude’s wife, Marie, and when Iexplained who I was, she invited me in. I was in luck again; she was studyingfor a teacher’s examination and was wrestling with The Canterbury Tales, findingit impossible to understand the language. I had read much of Chaucer in mymid-teens, and spent the next hour helping her with ‘The Knight’s Tale’. Sheimmediately offered to let me stay there – although they had only a single room.Claude soon came home, and seemed equally pleased that his wife had foundherself an English instructor. That evening, I ate steak with vegetables, andslept on an air mattress. When I look back on all this I wince: it was hard workbeing young.But fate seemed to be on my side. The next day, I picked up a curiously printedbook from Claude’s piano; it was called Étincelles de mon Enclume, and seemed tobe in an extremely weird French (‘seconde edition’ said the title page). It wasfull of vaguely humanistic sentiments: ‘L’homme a plus de valeur que l’or,’‘Plus important que le théâtre et la musique est la parole humaine.’ The name ofthe author was on the title page: Raymond Duncan. Claude saw me reading it. ‘Ahyes, he is an American millionaire who runs a school for writers in the rue deSeine.’ I pricked up my ears. Claude showed me another volume by Duncan, thistime in English. It seemed to be full of a kind of Whitmanesque poetry: > Look above to the sky and under> Your feet the earth> Here is our theatre. The sentiments struck me as sloppy and vague, but if this man was a patron ofyoung writers, I was not going to be choosy. Claude gave me a couple of métrotickets, and I made my way to the rue de Seine. Number 31 was halfway down thestreet, close to the hotel where Wilde had died. There was a large opencourtyard with sculptured objects lying around. I found the office, and spoke toa large woman in a white sackcloth garb like a nun’s. This was Mme Aia Bertrand,Duncan’s second-in-command. When I told her I admired Raymond’s writing – a flatlie – she became quite friendly. I asked her what order she belonged to. Shelooked indignant. ‘No order. I am an atheist.’Raymond Duncan came in. I was disappointed. His photographs – there were many ofthem around – showed a keen, hawklike man with long white hair held around hisforehead with a band like an Indian headdress, wearing a white toga. He lookedlike the prophet of some Californian cult. This man was small, and he was so oldthat his face had lost the stern, piercing look; he was nearsighted and worethick glasses, and his toga was a kind of dirty white nightdress made oftowelling. His manner was kindly, but one got the impression that he wasthinking of other things, or perhaps was just deaf.He explained to me that his philosophy was that men should return to the oldstandards of medieval craftsmen; everybody would be happier if they worked withtheir hands. As far as I could make out, his philosophy was a kind of humanisticanarchism rather like William Morris’s. He felt that modern society hadfragmented man and removed him from the old ideal of the ‘all-rounder’, theLeonardo ideal. He himself painted, sculpted, wrote poetry and produced his ownplays – all very badly, I later discovered – and he told me that he could alsomend a clock, build a wall, or make his own clothes.He and his two sisters – one was the famous Isadora Duncan – had left SanFrancisco as children and come to Europe. Isadora became a dancer who had ahabit of propositioning any man who attracted her – she caused a scandal withher creed of sexual freedom – and Raymond went to Greece and started to build atemple. In Paris, he spent one night inventing a pair of comfortable sandalsfrom a piece of leather and some thongs. He set up a shop to sell them and madea fortune. He devoted this to publishing his own poetry and producing his ownplays; he became a figure in the Paris of Tristan Tzara and the Dadaists. Heendorsed the sentiment of the American humorist Will Rogers: ‘I never met a manI didn’t like.’ Raymond felt a Whitmanesque affection for everybody,particularly the ‘ordinary people’. He told me how he had stayed at one of NewYork’s most expensive hotels, and when he left, the staff were all lined upwaiting for their tips; but instead of tipping them, Raymond went down the lineshaking hands with everybody. ‘They preferred that,’ he said earnestly. ‘Theydidn’t really want money.’ I tried not to smile.After rambling on for a quarter of an hour – and explaining, incidentally, thathe was not a millionaire, although he had made and lost several fortunes – hemade the offer I had been hoping for. ‘Come and stay here, and learn how to workwith your hands. I’ll teach you how to print your own books, present your ownplays …’ When Mme Bertrand came in a few minutes later and was told the news,she looked dubious but resigned,I went back to the rue Bayen bubbling with excitement. I would learn to print, Iwould finish my novel in the evenings, and then set it up myself. I would writeplays … Claude and Marie were as happy as I was, perhaps because they werefinding the room cramped with three in it. The next day, I moved into 31 rue deSeine. I hoped that this time I had landed on my feet, found something thatwould last. It certainly looked hopeful. It was what I had always dreamed aboutin Leicester – a place for artists, where I could use my energy for creationinstead of for jobs I hated … But it was hard to believe that my luck hadchanged so abruptly. Surely, such things just didn’t happen. Yeats says of hishermits: > They are plagued by crowds until> They’ve the passion to escape.When I felt low, I re-inflated my optimism by reflecting that perhaps this waswhy fate never allowed me to relax, why life was always difficult anduncomfortable, why every job became unbearable after a week or so. But Icouldn’t help wishing that fate would give me a breathing space. And it lookedas if the Akademia Duncan might be the answer to my prayer.It was not. I found work in the printshop unexpectedly boring. I was givenblocks of type to break up and put into various small trays. I was a kind ofodd-job man. On my first evening there, Raymond gave a lecture in the largehall. He spoke in French so bad that even I could understand it, waving his handup and down rhythmically while he reclined on a couch. Everything he saidsounded incredibly platitudinous. ‘La beauté est la seule morale des hommes, etla vertu compte seulement parce que la vertu a de la beauté.’ He declaimed itall slowly, as if reading poetry. ‘Mais l’univers est tout la beauté, tout lasublimité, mes amis …’ I thought of that line from The Man Who Came to Dinner:‘I may vomit’ – and had to stop myself from laughing. During the last year I hadbegun writing an early version of a novel I called Ritual in the Dark, a gloomybook about a murderer. I was obsessed by the concept of original sin and thenotion that modern society is a wasteland. And there was Raymond declaiming:‘L’une des plus grandes vertus de l’homme est d’être original. Cherchez nospoètes dans la vie, mes amis.’ And I was supposed to be his disciple …However, I had no money and no prospects, and the rue de Seine seemed as good aplace as any until something better turned up. I didn’t like the deception, butI could see no alternative. It was, however, a depressing place. There was onlyone other guest, a Swedish girl called Sybil, a plain little thing with spotsand glasses, who disliked it as much as I did. Mme Bertrand bullied her, and Ihated to see this. The rooms were gloomy, and I slept on a couch in the wings ofthe stage without a light.There was a cult of Isadora about the place. I read parts of her autobiography,and found her amusing but silly. She was described as beautiful, although Shawsaid her face looked as if it was made of sugar and someone had licked it. Thedeath of her two children, who had been drowned when her car rolled backwardsinto the Seine, seemed typical of the misfortunes she seemed to attract. So washer death, when a long scarf she was wearing caught in the rear wheel of a car,and she was strangled. But Raymond was a good, decent man, honest andwell-meaning. It wasn’t his fault if I was just about the most unsuitable personin the world to be anyone’s disciple.I wrote to my penfriend in Strasbourg and almost immediately a letter containingfive thousand francs came back, with an urgent request to go and see him.I needed no second bidding. After a mere two weeks I had a sense that MmeBertrand was growing tired of me – I spent every evening at the Bibliothèque SteGenevieve writing my novel. Sybil had decided to leave unannounced, and I had tohelp smuggle out her clothes. After playing a Chopin recital, a homosexualpianist named Victor Gille had invited me to go and live with him, and for amoment I had even toyed with the idea as a way of giving myself the freedom towrite, but the idea of being sodomised did not appeal to me.Finally, a rich American woman had invited me to her hotel for tea. She allowedme to read her some of my poetry, and told me enthusiastically that she thoughtthat one day I might be as great as Mr Somerset Maugham. Raymond and MmeBertrand seemed to think this was a shameless piece of opportunism, and Raymondeven told me so that evening over dinner – it was unusual to see him so stern –and went on to say that I had come there on false pretences. I could saynothing, since it was true.So, when the money came and I told Raymond and Mme Bertrand I wanted to visitStrasbourg, and added that I might be back some day, Mme Aia said very firmly:‘No, no one who leaves here is allowed to come back.’ I could sympathise withthem – no one wants cuckoos in the nest. (I have put up with many of them sincethen.)The journey took me three days. Willi lived in a flat with his middle-classfamily – his father, who was a scrap merchant, his plump mother, a typicallyhard-headed Frenchwoman, and a plump and pretty sister. When he had stayed withus in Leicester, he and I had laughed and joked and made atrocious French puns.But we had both changed a lot. He had become a Communist, who thought that theworkers should murder the rich. I still thought seriously that I mighteventually end up as a monk. So now we could not get into a discussion withoutgetting exasperated with one another. After three weeks, the family had clearlyhad enough of me, and one morning his mother explained regretfully that theyneeded my room for someone else.I called at the British Consulate and explained that I wanted to be repatriated.There was no difficulty; they gave me my rail tickets within an hour, took awaymy passport as a pledge and gave me a temporary one, good only for the returntrip. I caught a train to Calais late that afternoon. There was a certainexcitement in being in motion again, even though I had nothing much to lookforward to in England.Suddenly, life seemed interesting and adventurous, and the last two months tohave been worthwhile. I now remembered sitting alone in the square in Lille, andfeeling that if I now vanished into thin air, no one would know I had gone – asense of total contingency and unimportance. Now this seemed self-evidentlyfalse; as the train clattered on through the night, there was a feeling likegetting the exam results at the end of term, and seeing you have passed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4> MARRIAGE AND LONDONIt was pleasant to be back in Leicester, but the problems that had driven meaway – how to earn a living while teaching myself to write – were stillunresolved. The only difference was that I no longer felt stifled and depressedby my home town.And there was still the problem of Mary. She had written to me in Paris andStrasbourg, and her letters were full of talk about missing me, and how weshould get engaged as soon as I got home. Now that the actual habit of seeingher daily was broken, I knew that it would be pure stupidity to renew ourrelationship. On the other hand, she would have to know I was back sooner orlater.I shirked the problem for a week, then went along to Woolworths to meet her asshe went off for lunch. She looked startled to see me; and yet, I thought, notparticularly happy. ‘How long have you been back?’ ‘A few days,’ I saidevasively. ‘Why didn’t you contact me?’ ‘Oh, I wanted to find a job first …’We were walking along Charles Street, and the wind was freezing. She saidsuddenly: ‘I suppose I’d better tell you … I’ve been going out with a bloke Imet at a dance.’ I should have been pleased, but I felt an irrational jealousy.Yet the situation had not really changed. I met her that evening and we went tosee my grandmother. When we were alone for a moment, I kissed her, and her mouthopened after a moment, as it always had. I raised her dress and pulled aside theleg of her knickers. She gasped: ‘God, it’s so long since I’ve had it.’ ‘Whatabout your new boyfriend.’ ‘He’d be shocked if I even mentioned sex.’I gathered that he was a quiet, shy man, an engineer, who wanted to marry herright away.The next day was Mary’s afternoon off and she came back to our house. My motherwas out shopping. Mary told me she would visit only on condition that I ‘behavedmyself’, and I agreed. I knew her by this time. When she kissed, she seemed tolose control of herself; her lips parted, her hips began to move, and when I putmy hand up her dress, she opened her legs to make it easier. Afterwards, she layon the rug gasping, her eyes closed. I said, ‘You’ll have to be careful youdon’t do that with your boyfriend. You’d frighten the life out of him.’ Shesaid, ‘I know. But he’s so shy.’ She opened her eyes. ‘I’d much rather marryyou.’ And so we were back in the old stalemate.My feelings about her were divided. I felt strongly protective, and had toacknowledge that, as she was growing up, she was becoming beautiful. Her ovalface, regular features and pink cheeks made men stare, and her smile made peoplesmile back. She was naturally generous and good-natured. Her slim figure andlong legs were beautiful. But she had the strongest Leicester accent I have everheard, with its gutteral u’s and dropped aitches. There were times when I feltshe was exaggerating it out of a kind of defiance, and I doubt whether ProfessorHiggins could have persuaded her to abandon it. And quarrelling and burstinginto tears were part of her nature, which I found wearing.It was midwinter – uncomfortable weather for building jobs. Moreover, my fatherwanted me to go back into the Civil Service. We finally compromised, and I tooka job in the office of an engineering works, Richards (Leicester) Ltd. The paywas absurdly small – £3 a week – but the work was not hard and, to begin with,not too boring. I had to file receipts and orders. I also had to wander aroundthe works – which were spread over a large area – delivering sheaves of paper tothe foremen of various departments. It was fascinating to watch the molten metalpouring out of the furnaces, or showers of sparks leaping into the air. Underdifferent circumstances, I might have been happy enough there – certainly, mytrip to France had reduced the inner tension and made me more comfortable withmyself. But I had to write books, and all this had nothing to do with it. Ididn’t want to marry Mary and settle down to an office job. I didn’t want to doany of the things that society and my parents seemed to want me to do. But whileI was working forty hours a week for three pounds, my freedom of movement waslimited.I continued to see Mary; but both of us had the sense that something was ending.She knew I wasn’t in love with her and that her new boyfriend was; she wantedsecurity. One day I came back from work to find all the books I had given herpiled up in a pram on the front lawn, including a lavishly illustrated editionof Shakespeare in four volumes. I made no attempt to see her after that. She haddone the sensible thing, and I knew it. Still, it was difficult not toexperience a neurotic sense of having been rejected. I tore out the inscriptionsfrom the books and put them in a cupboard.One day at work, I went to see the resident nurse about a sore throat. Betty wasa fair-haired girl; not pretty, but with an attractive mouth. The first time Isaw her, I thought her cool and forbidding; she had a cut-glass, upper-classaccent, and her look could be frigid. She was nine years my senior (I was stillnineteen), and her coolness and self-control were an attraction, after Mary andher violent emotions. At first, the relation was casually flirtatious – beforegoing into her office, I would pull my tie askew, knowing that her innatetidiness would make her straighten it, and that I could try to put my arms roundher. On closer acquaintance, the icy manner proved to be superficial; she was afriendly, shy, level-headed sort of person. I found myself liking herincreasingly. Her background was in many ways the same as mine – working-class;and her childhood had been thoroughly unhappy. She had left home at thebeginning of the war and become a nurse in London, working there throughout theBlitz. The man she was engaged to was killed in the RAF. Since then, she hadconcentrated on her career. Unlike me, she had no basic trust in life. I oncesaid to her that she was like a rabbit hiding in its hole, and she replied: ‘Isuppose so, but every time I stick my head out, someone hits me on it.’I made excuses to call in at her office. After a while it was no longernecessary to make excuses; she was obviously glad to see me. One day, sheinvited me back to her flat for coffee. The very word ‘flat’ had a romantic ringfor me. Cycling there that evening, I wondered if she had had many lovers, andwhether I was a likely candidate for the next.The answer – that evening at any rate – was no. She made it clear that theinvitation to her flat was for coffee and nothing else. Cautiously flirtatiousin her office, she became defensive on home territory. When I left, she allowedme to kiss her, but she kissed stiffly, with her lips tightly closed. I pushedmy bicycle out into the road thinking: Oh, well, that settles that … I stillwinced when I thought of Mary; I had no intention of being rejected again.But when I saw her over the next few days, she was friendly and, when I kissedher in her office, made no strenuous objection. At this time I was readingHemingway’s A Farewell to Arms, and couldn’t help feeling that my attitudetowards Betty was much the same as that of Frederic Henry towards CatherineBarkley. I liked her, and the cool, rather distant attitude aroused the usualmasculine desire to break down resistance – perhaps the nurse’s uniform hadsomething to do with it.When I’d got over my irritation at her aloofness, I found I liked her air ofself-possession and her sense of responsibility. Her temperament was much closerto mine than Mary’s had been. I enjoyed going to her flat to eat supper, andthen perhaps listen to an opera on the Third Programme, or read her the latestchapter of Ritual in the Dark, or a play in the manner of Granville-Barker thatI was struggling with.Slowly, her sexual reserve melted. She was completely unlike Mary in that sheseemed to have no sexual drive that was independent of her personal feelings.She didn’t even enjoy flirting to any great extent. She started by liking me,then grew fond of me and became accustomed to seeing me around; it would neverhave occurred to her to conceal that she was fond of me or indulge in aLawrencian sex war. I realise in retrospect that I became her lover because shewas already thinking of me as a husband, and recognised that the platonicrelationship was bound to end eventually. I was too restless to put up with itfor long, and was already making plans to return to London.I had a number of friends in Leicester. I still saw Alan, although I got tiredof his petulance and desire to dominate. Jackie, my other homosexual friend, wasstill at Leicester University. There was also a painter, Stanley Rosenthal, whomI called ‘Rab’ because of his Rabelaisian sense of humour, and I saw a greatdeal of a poet called Maurice Willows, whose wife Freda typed the early versionof Ritual in the Dark.The original story had been about a man who murders a prostitute in the act ofpossessing her; the murder is a sudden welling up of total frustration at acivilisation that starves our souls. The story was about a frustration andexhaustion that have gone so deep that the man lives in a daze: he never feelsanything; he lives automatically; and when he has killed the girl he feels noguilt because it all seems unreal. He confesses the murder to a girl he sleepswith, but she doesn’t believe him. Then he attempts suicide by drinking ratpoison, but it only makes him vomit. Obviously, he has to go on living somehow,find some sense of motive. But when I finished the story, I had no idea of theanswer.In later versions, I decided that it would be more interesting if the reader isnever sure whether the hero is a murderer or not. The hero suffers from aconstant sense of unreality and from hallucinations. The question he wantsanswered is: if I did kill her, and I feel no guilt, am I still guilty? And ifthe answer is yes, then perhaps I am guilty even if I didn’t kill her, for I amobviously capable of it; if I weren’t capable of it, I’d know I didn’t kill her.At a certain point, the novel was entitled Things Do Not Happen.It turned into a story about a man under extreme mental strain, who reads that aprostitute has been found strangled in her bed, and thinks he may be the killer.What I wanted to do was to write the definitive novel of mental strain – it wasat about this time that I read Charles Jackson’s Lost Weekend, and felt that hehad missed the opportunity to write a masterpiece.I immediately encountered one of the major problems of the modern novel. If youask what Ulysses or Manhattan Transfer or Alexanderplatz, Berlin is about, theanswer is: the essence of Dublin, or of New York, or of Berlin. And becausethese books are about the essence of a place, they cannot have a straightforwardplot, or a single hero; they have to move around, to present a panorama. A‘story’ would run away with the book and falsify the author’s intention; thereader would concentrate on the story instead of on what the author is trying totell him.This was my problem. What I wanted to tell the reader about was the sense ofunreality that comes from frustration, long periods when there is nothing youwant to do, and consequently you never use the will. And the real question thispoints to is: what ought we to be doing with our lives? Are they supposed to bea useless movement to keep ourselves alive: ‘birth, copulation, and death’?I wanted to write a novel in which the central character goes around with thisquestion on his mind all the time, so that ordinary situations arouse aperpetual sense of irony. The values of ordinary people strike him as illusions.History is fuelled by illusions. Armies fight, patriots rant, lovers sweareverlasting vows, the religious talk about eternal fire – but it is all soundand fury. Nothing really happens. Time is, in some sense, an illusion. Perfectlyordinary situations would do; it is the way he sees them that counts.And this raised the problem of the structure of the novel. A novel should have apurposive forward movement. How could I give it some kind of form? It was atabout this time that I discovered The Egyptian Book of the Dead in the locallibrary, and saw the possibility of using it as the basis of a novel, as Joycehad used the Odyssey. It is a series of prayers for the use of the soul on thenight after death, to protect it against the various perils that it encounters –such as blood-sucking worms – before it emerges the next morning into Amentet,the Egyptian underworld.I structured the later versions of the novel on The Egyptian Book of the Dead. Iwas even struck by the coincidence that the book was also known as Ritual of theDead, one of the early titles I had chosen for my novel. The notion of theunderworld suited me perfectly. If working in a bank had made Eliot see thecrowds crossing London Bridge as souls in Limbo, my own years in dreary jobs hadmade me feel that our situation is Hell itself. I wanted my ‘outsider’ to walkthrough its trivialities and complexities possessed by some foreboding ofjudgment, seeing his world as the culmination of the agony of centuries. I started a kind of literary group that met once a week in the upstairs room ofa café near the Clock Tower. We ate cheese rolls and drank tea, and read aloudour poems and short stories.It was impossible for me not to be aware that I was a long way ahead of most ofthem as a writer. The years of endless scribbling in my diary were paying off. Ihad read more than any of them, and could produce a pastiche of almost anybodyat a moment’s notice. On one occasion, when Maurice Willows sent me a messagethat he could not come and read his poetry, I wrote a five-page poem in jazzrhythms in an hour before going to the meeting, interspersed with limerick-stylestanzas that shamelessly imitated Auden: > Come to our jungle paradise> Where the laws are ineffectual,> Where tigers play> Shooting crap all day> And the elephants are homosexual.It was a huge success and they encored it.I was becoming something of a character in Leicester, at least among the young.It was time I had something published. But in spite of our literary group, Ilacked any real desire to socialise. Old problems were still acute. To beginwith, there was work. After a month or so, the engineering works began tosuffocate me every time I walked into the building and smelled its individualodour of dust and machine oil. Betty could not understand my moods; one evening,when I was tense and irritable, and left early, she thought I had gone off tomeet another girl. In fact, I was thinking about my obsessive creative drive andhating this comfortable life of meeting friends in coffee bars or eating mealsin Betty’s flat. The spur was digging in again.As soon as the weather became a little warmer, I gave up the job at Richards,and went to work for the Leicester Electricity Board as a navvy. On my firstday, it started to snow, and went on for two weeks. Having lost the habit ofphysical labour, I would get home exhausted. But at least the exhaustion dulledthe sense of wasting my life. Betty was also going through a difficult period:she was a senior member of the firm, and was having differences of opinion withits managing director, who both admired her and quarrelled with her. Sometimesshe burst into tears, the rigid self-discipline suddenly cracking; and embracesthat were intended to comfort her lost in restraint what they gained inexcitement.But I wanted more time to write and think. Digging trenches to lay electriccables was less boring than office work, but very nearly as repetitive. I didn’twant to do other people’s work; I wanted to get on with my own. One day,returning from work in a state of irritable fatigue, it struck me that thismanual labour was so much better paid than the office that I could afford towork only half the time. This was obviously the solution! Two or three days atwork, and the rest of the week in the Central Library, working on my novel. Atthat rate, the book could be finished in six months.In a state of optimism and excitement, I went to the offices of the ElectricityBoard and explained my problem – that I was a student, and would like to workpart time. They said they had no objections if my foreman was agreeable. Theycontacted him, and he said he didn’t mind either. I went back to work in a stateof elation, already planning a rigid writing schedule. But when I got there, theforeman explained that he had had to change his mind: the other men thought itwas favouritism to allow me to work half-time, and threatened to walk off thejob. It was the typical spirit of the British workman: since they couldn’tafford to work half-time, they saw no reason why I should be allowed to. I toldthe foreman that I would prefer not to work with such a mean-spirited crew, andwent to the office for my cards.The next job was the pleasantest so far: I was engaged as an odd-job man in theDalmas chemical factory. The work was varied and interesting, and I liked thepeople I worked with. I had various tasks to complete at different hours of theday: boiling up the resin and lanoline that was the basis of the adhesive onsticking plasters, disposing of empty crates, supplying half a dozen machinesand coordinating their activities. It was a responsible kind of job, with acertain amount of free time. I was reading The Magic Mountain, The BrothersKaramazov and William James’s The Varieties of Religious Experience.I had made a list of books that struck me as saying something interesting orworthwhile: D. H. Lawrence’s Man Who Died, Nijinsky’s Diary, Hemingway’s Acrossthe River and Into the Trees, Wells’s Mind at the End of its Tether. I decidedto write a series of essays, raising the same concepts in each, applying them toeach of the books to show their relations, the way in which each is concernedwith the basic problem of values. These essays later became the foundation ofThe Outsider.And then, one evening, Betty told me she thought she was pregnant. I could onlyhope she was mistaken. At last I was working at a job I enjoyed, writing well,and optimistic about the prospects of publication. Nothing could have been moreirrelevant than a baby. I was fond of Betty, but I didn’t want to marry anybody.A few days later she told me it had all been a false alarm, and I heaved animmense sigh of relief. I had just bought myself a record of the final dance inStravinsky’s Firebird (I could not afford the whole ballet), and as I waslistening to it in the shop, experienced a great upsurge of sheer delight. Wedecided to take a weekend’s break in Wales, and for two days I was walking onair. Then she told me that she had been mistaken and was pregnant after all, andonce again I felt like a condemned man.I asked friends about it: one suggested hot baths and gin, another oil offennel; another said that the best thing would be to have the baby and have itadopted. Betty rejected all these suggestions, and said that there were reallyonly two alternatives: I should marry her, or go away and leave her to have thebaby alone.It was as disastrous for her as for me; she had just received promotion, and wonher long argument on some important point of policy with the boss.I felt that this was a repetition of the basic Mary situation: a conflictbetween my common sense and my desire not to hurt. Finally, my parents cast thedeciding vote by advising marriage. On 6 June 1951, Betty and I were married atthe Leicester registry office in the lunch hour, then she hurried back to work.Our best man was a brawny Welshman called Alan Nottingham. Betty paid for thering. I spent the evening with her, in a rather subdued mood, then set out tohitch-hike to London. We had to live together somewhere, and I was determinedthat it shouldn’t be Leicester.I spent the next night in the youth hostel in Great Ormond Street. John Clementsand Kay Hammond were doing Man and Superman at the Princes Theatre, and I wentto see it (the first of six times). It had always been my favourite Shaw play,but now some of the dialogue had a ring of irony. ‘The true artist will let hiswife starve, his children go barefoot, his mother drudge for a living atseventy, sooner than work at anything but his art.’ Clearly, I was not a trueartist. And when Ann tells Tanner that he doesn’t have to get married if hedoesn’t want to, he asks: ‘Does any man want to be hanged? Yet men letthemselves be hanged without a struggle for life, though they could at leastgive the chaplain a black eye.’ The cap certainly fitted.I found myself a room in Camden Town and moved in. It was at the end ofRochester Road, and cost thirty shillings a week. The landlady was one of themost tolerable I ever met; Shaw’s description of Mrs Warren as a ‘genial andfairly presentable old blackguard of a woman’ fitted her exactly. On my firstday there, she told me in confidence that the honeymoon couple in the basementwere decorating it, and that as soon as they were finished she meant to givethem notice and charge a higher rent for the place.I went to the Labour Exchange, and was directed to a building job at theCatholic church of St Etheldreda’s. It is one of the oldest churches in London,and all the beams in the ceiling were being replaced. It was a dangerous job,for the new ones had to be manoeuvred past the scaffolding, and the ropes oftenslipped as the heavy beams were hauled aloft. One of them slid free and made asix-inch dent in the floor; luckily there was no one underneath.I looked through the evening paper every day and made a list of the flats anddouble rooms to let, then spent an hour in the telephone box ringing thelandladies. It was a discouraging business. Unfurnished flats always wanted alarge down payment for ‘furniture and fittings’, since they wererent-controlled, and this was the only way the owners could evade the law.Furnished flats were all well beyond our means. Double rooms were easy enough tofind, but as soon as I mentioned that my wife was pregnant, the landlady alwayssaid: ‘Sorry, no children,’ and hung up. My present landlady hinted that shemight have a place for us in a month or so, but I knew her too well by this timeto rely on it.I had come to London with three pounds borrowed from my grandmother, but mymoney ran out before I was due for my first week’s wages – which, as is usual inEngland, were paid at the end of the second week of work. Then, one day, I camefrom work to find that Betty had sent me money and an enormous parcel of food.This was not simply a relief and a pleasant surprise; it also made me recognisethat marriage has other aspects besides mere responsibility; there were benefitsas well as drawbacks.A few days later, Betty joined me in London for the weekend of my twentiethbirthday. During the course of that weekend, our relationship changed; I ceasedto feel that this marriage was a nuisance and a misfortune, and realised with ashock that I was probably going to enjoy being married. In my relationship withMary it had come as a surprise to me that I have a strong protective streak.With Betty, this had never had a chance to appear, because of her tendency toemotional reserve. Now we were married, she had no more reason for reserve; shetrusted me and accepted me, and my response was to become protective. And I knewsuddenly that her need for affection and understanding was as strong as Mary’s.I am naturally affectionate and demonstrative; I find that the noisy expressionof affection is good for my soul. Betty could take all I had to give. Blakerightly points out that ‘what men in women do require’, and vice versa, is ‘thelineaments of satisfied desire’; that is, that each should need what the otherhas to give. Also, Betty, unlike Mary, had a great deal to give besidesaffection and trust; she had self-discipline and practical ability, and was usedto cooking and running a home.The result of all this was that when Betty returned to Leicester on Sundayevening, we were both perfectly happy about the marriage, and parted on thetenderest of terms. She intended to give up her job in about a month – by whichtime her pregnancy would start showing – and move to London. I had to step up mysearch for a home. But at least, I was now doing it because I wanted to; we wereboth impatient to live together.In spite of all this, it was an ill-fated marriage from the beginning. Two daysafter Betty returned to Leicester, I received a furious letter from her. Thetelephonist at work had asked her if it was true she was married. The culpritwas a friend of mine called Millicent, whom I had known since we were togetherin the tax office, who was in the same amateur dramatic group as thetelephonist. Obviously the point was that she had also mentioned why we had gotmarried, and this was what really hurt. Betty’s attitude toward sex was rigidand prudish. (She could not even bring herself to tell her mother the reason wemarried, even after the baby had been born; I had to make a special trip toLeicester to tell her that she now had a grandson, some six months after hisbirth.)I was equally furious about her prudishness, and the way she had turned on me,and pointed out in my reply that she had promised to love, honour and obey, andthat this burst of fury was hardly an example of wifely tolerance andunderstanding. Her reply was even angrier; and since I am an impatient person,the marriage might well have come to an end there. I was so angry, I took a dayoff from work and hitch-hiked to Leicester. But as soon as we actually saw eachother, the old sexual magic began to work; we made it up within minutes. Still,the episode is an example of the kind of clash that would finally break up themarriage. The chief emotional component on my side was protectiveness; as soonas this was rejected, I felt the links dissolve. They could be resoldered, buteach time they became slightly weaker.I found a small double room in East Finchley, and also changed my job: I movedto Frazer and Glass, a plastics factory in North Finchley. The work wasrepetitive but not difficult, and I liked the place; I could usually earn aboutten pounds a week. Betty left her job and joined me at the beginning of August,and suddenly I was quite contented with life.It was also at this time that I discovered Seven Pillars of Wisdom, throughreading the anthology The Essential T. E. Lawrence. Betty had the complete bookin two volumes, but I had found it too long to read. I now saw that Lawrence wasone of the few modern writers who was aware of the same problems that obsessedme. Why was he so little known? Why had Eliot never written about him? I seemedto have stumbled upon a large number of important books that no one else seemedto know about: Nijinsky’s Diary, Wells’s Mind at the End of Its Tether,Granville-Barker’s Secret Life, Hesse’s Steppenwolf. It was also in the Finchleylibrary that I found The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. I decided that I must oneday write a book relating them all.I found this new routine of marriage very satisfying: I would return from workto find my supper waiting for me. Then we might go to see a film, or I wouldwalk to the library. At half past nine or so, we would open up the bed-settee,and both get into bed and read. On weekends, we took bus trips to other parts ofLondon, or went for walks around the Finchley area; or I might take a bus to theBritish Museum and spend Saturday afternoon writing my novel in the ReadingRoom. This was not because the place was any more convenient for writing than athome, but because it was enjoyable to think that I was writing in the same placeas Samuel Butler, Karl Marx, Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells. (When The Outsidercame out, I was gratified when some press cutting about the Reading Room addedmy name to this list.)I think I know why I enjoyed being married so much: it was another version ofthe old craving for order. Children like stories because they are less chaoticthan the real world; they do not have choices to make, they do not have to‘interpret’. The story channels their emotions cleanly and simply, like a canal;in real life, there are too many distractions, and it is only in rare moments ofhappiness that the emotional response to real life can be so uncomplicated. Veryyoung children are protected by parental love, but this becomes less protectiveat about the age of seven, as the child becomes more independent. Thereafter,the child has to learn to deal with the chaos as best he can.I had got through most of my teens without much love or attention; I had learnedto deal with the chaos on my own. And now, suddenly, I was back in somethingvery like the secure world of childhood; one other person in the worldthoroughly approved of me and believed in me, and cooked my meals and allowed meto remove her clothes. It was like relaxing in a warm bath after a hard day’swork.And then, a month before the baby was due, our landlady gave us notice. She hadalready warned us that we would have to find new lodgings when the baby arrived,but she suddenly became panic-stricken at the idea that it might be premature,and her family kept awake by its wailing. I had now reached the stage ofexpecting this kind of thing from landladies, and subsequent experience withthem convinced me that becoming a landlady is the surest way to forfeit yourimmortal soul. I used to daydream of a dictatorship that would pack allEngland’s landladies on to ships and send them to a remote part of Patagonia,where they could torment one another with their malice and stupidity.The foreman at work offered me a room in his house, and we were living therewhen the baby arrived – a boy whom we called Roderick Gerard – the second namebeing that of the hero of Ritual in the Dark. But a few weeks later, our newlandlady gave us notice – the baby’s crying had been more than she had bargainedfor. I spent the next week searching for another room, but when it became clearthat I wouldn’t find one in time, Betty decided to return to Leicester for awhile. She stayed with my parents, because she had still not told her motherabout the baby. I quickly found myself a single room in Golders Green, on aconvenient bus route to the factory. My new landlady was a hard-faced woman withgenteel pretensions, and I knew as soon as I saw her that I would have trouble.On the day I moved in – with half a dozen cases, a trunk and two tea chests fullof books – she stood by the front door, wailing that she would never have rentedme the room if she had known I had so much luggage. From then on, I usuallyfound a note from her in my room when I returned home from work: ‘Please takecare not to spill sugar on the carpet’, ‘Please do not leave teacups onwindowsill’. She nagged about the empty tea chests, although they were storedaway in a corner, and finally paid the dustman to take them away; then shedemanded the money back from me. I gave it to her for the sake of peace. Ishould have been spending my weekends looking for a new home for us, but I wasgetting tired of moving around; instead, I worked on Ritual.Luckily, Betty decided to advertise in a nursing journal for a job that wouldinclude accommodation, and received a reply from a Mr Penman, who lived aloneand wanted a resident nurse–housekeeper. And so, with immense relief, I gave mylandlady notice – she was furious that I had been there such a short time,although she had done everything to drive me out. In the spring of 1952, Bettyand I moved into a comfortable, semidetached house in Queens Road, Wimbledon. MrPenman suffered from asthma; he was a retired businessman, and at first struckus as extremely generous. He was so anxious to retain Betty’s services that hetold her at an early stage that he intended to leave her the house in his will;he also gave me permission to use his typewriter whenever I liked. We wereunderstandably sceptical about the house offer, but I made full use of thetypewriter. I spent Saturday afternoons writing in the British Museum, and thentyped it up on Sunday morning. It was on one of these Saturday afternoons in theReading Room that it suddenly struck me that I should set my novel in the EastEnd of London, and perhaps bring in the locales of the Jack the Ripper murdersof 1888.I cycled to Whitechapel after the museum closed; and there I realised that Ineeded two main characters in my novel: the hero, and the murderer with whom hebecomes involved. And the Whitechapel murders would provide a storyline thatneed not interfere with the major theme of the book. As far as Ritual wasconcerned, this was the breakthrough that turned it from a rather muddled andimpressionistic account of boredom into a narrative that had a sense of flow.It was in the Wimbledon Public Library that I came across a book called InSearch of the Miraculous by P. D. Ouspensky, and knew at once that this was oneof the most important books I had ever read. It describes, of course, how theyoung Moscow journalist Ouspensky is introduced to an exotic-looking strangerwhom he calls G, a man with the ‘face of an Indian rajah’. G explains that heand his pupils are engaged in a task which they call ‘the work’, but offers nofurther explanation. It is only after several meetings, when Ouspensky complainsthat people are turning into machines, that G tells Ouspensky that the simpletruth is that we are all machines, possessing virtually no free will, and thatmoreover we are all asleep. It is only gradually that Ouspensky begins tounderstand what G means when he says that our lives are lived on an entirelymechanical level, and that only with a tremendous effort can we cease to bemachines. This effort is what G calls ‘the work’.The book influenced me so deeply because I had long recognised that a large partof me was ‘mechanical’. T. S. Eliot has a line in The Family Reunion: ‘partialobservation of one’s own automatism’. Of course, what really interested me wasthe question Ouspensky asked G: how is it possible to become free?I was even more delighted when I discovered in the library a book called VentureWith Ideas, which explained it all in far simpler language, and which made clearthat G was George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff. I immediately recognised the name, for Ihad glanced at a great fat volume called All and Everything in a bookshop inKensington Church Street, and had been deeply curious to know what its authorhad to say that took him over a thousand pages. Now I was about to find out.The author of Venture With Ideas was a doctor named Kenneth Walker, and nothingwould have amazed me more than to learn that one day he would become a friend.Meanwhile, I tried to learn all I could about this amazing man Gurdjieff, whowas quite obviously one of the greatest minds I had ever encountered.It was also in the Wimbledon Public Library that I discovered the I Ching, theChinese book of ‘oracles’, newly published in a two-volume translation byRichard Wilhelm, and introduced by Jung.Being an aspiring writer, the first thing I wanted to know was about my ownfuture. I followed the procedure described by Jung: shook three pennies in mycupped hands and threw them down six times. A preponderance of heads signifiesan unbroken line, meaning yang, the positive principle. A preponderance of tailssignifies a broken line, the negative or yielding principle. These lines areplaced on top of one another like a sandwich, forming a ‘hexagram’ which is oneof sixty-four. The ‘Judgement’ of the I Ching then interprets their meaning.The answer to my question about my future was six unbroken lines, the firsthexagram in the book, ‘The Creative’: > The creative works supreme success> Furthering through perseverance.This, of course, told me what I had hoped to hear. And in the hundreds of timesI have consulted the I Ching since then, I have never thrown six unbroken lines.I consulted the oracle about our present situation with the old man, andreceived the hexagram Sung, Conflict, which stated: ‘You are sincere but arebeing obstructed’. It advised caution, and added: ‘It does not further to crossthe great water’. This answered my question about the old man, who was becomingso difficult that we were tempted to move immediately; the I Ching made usdecide not to be rash. As to crossing the great water, we had thought of movingback north of the Thames, and when we finally did so, the move was – as I shalldescribe – something of a disaster.One of the ‘lines’ struck me as oddly appropriate. The old man had aninfuriating habit of giving my wife presents when in a good mood, and takingthem back later. The I Ching told us: ‘Even if you are given a leather belt, itwill have been snatched away three times by the end of the morning’.I had decided not to leave my job in the plastics factory, even though it meanta long journey from Wimbledon to Finchley. I was satisfied with my job, whichconsisted of spraying models of Piccadilly’s Eros and the Houses of Parliament,or stamping the label on plastic deodorant bottles. So I travelled back andforth on the Northern line for two hours every day.But the persistent fate that refused to allow me a sense of security began tointerfere. The old man became increasingly capricious. He obviously resented mypresence in the house and would have preferred Betty to himself. He made a habitof having asthmatic attacks a few minutes after we had got into bed, as if hisaim was to interrupt lovemaking. He would get Betty out of bed half a dozentimes in the night, when there was clearly nothing wrong with him, and wouldoften stay locked in the bathroom for hours, although there was only onelavatory in the house and it caused us some inconvenience. He told his part-timesecretary to take away the typewriter; supposedly to do work at home, butactually to prevent me from using it. Our patience began to wear thin.I still enjoyed being married, but it was not quite as quarrel-free as I hadanticipated. The trouble was partly the difference in age, partly the fact thatBetty had established an independent way of life before she met me. The episodeof the telephonist who asked her if she was married demonstrated her capacityfor working up a resentment. Married people are bound to do things occasionallythat strike the other as tactless or thoughtless, or just selfish, and when thishappened, she was likely to end by telling me that I was immature, and that Iwould see things differently when I was ten years older. This kind of thingwould, of course, throw me into a fury.One or two quarrels were due to her strange prudishness. One day when I wasadjusting the blind on our bedroom window, I realised that I could almost leanacross to the bathroom window, a few feet away, where I could see Betty washingbefore coming to bed. I was tempted to say Boo, but didn’t want to startle her.When she came into the bedroom a few minutes later, I told her I could see herfrom the bedroom window. She flew into a rage that I found incomprehensible andcalled me a Peeping Tom. I pointed out that Peeping Toms spy on strangers, andthat she was my wife, but it made no difference.The prudishness made me laugh when she got undressed. She would remove her skirtand stockings with her back to me, put a nightdress over her head, then give asudden wriggle so that her underskirt and knickers fell round her feet as thenightdress descended. But on the two or three occasions when her prudishnesscaused a quarrel, I felt less amused by it. One day I dismounted from my bicyclewith a bottle of orange cordial in my pocket, and it shot out and exploded onthe pavement. We had very little money, and I went into the house cursingloudly; she bridled and told me to wash my mouth out. This struck me ascompletely unreasonable; I was swearing to relieve my exasperation and, in fact,I had been feeling almost cheerful when she spoiled everything. My feelingtowards her was based on protectiveness; it turned to fury when she treated meas a foul-mouthed stranger.The old man finally became such a nuisance that we decided to leave. Bettywarned his sister that she intended to give notice. The sister begged her tostay, and offered twenty-five pounds as an inducement, telling her that therewould be a similar present every six months. This certainly made a difference.What is more, it enabled us to take our first holiday since we were married. Wewent to Hayling Island, leaving the old man in the charge of a no-nonsense hirednurse. It was a delightful week, which seemed a presentiment of a better future.We went to see Blake’s cottage at Felpham, spent a day looking at ChichesterCathedral (where I discovered Eliot’s excellent pamphlet on cathedrals,emphasising the need for leisure), and went to look at the Victory atPortsmouth. On Felpham Beach, I felt as if I could see Blake’s angelic formshovering over the sea. I was also sick from eating too many tomatoes.At the end of the week, we returned to Wimbledon, en route for Leicester, anddiscovered that Mr Penman was dead. Perhaps the no-nonsense nurse had induced aheart attack, or perhaps he induced one himself in a transport of self-pity. ButI also recalled a curious experience that had happened a few days before weleft. The old man had done something more than usually infuriating, and as Ithought about this, I felt a rising tide of sheer rage and hatred. And then,quite suddenly, it seemed to reach a sort of climax, like an orgasm, and wentaway. I found myself wondering if I had somehow directed a curse at him. Thenovelist John Cowper Powys once said that people he had reason to detest oftenmet with sudden misfortune, until he felt forced to discipline himself into astate of ‘neurotic benevolence’.The old man’s sister told us we could stay in the house for a while, and I wasalso able to recover the typewriter, which she told me I could keep. Now at lastI began to type up Ritual in the Dark.The next few months were the happiest time of our marriage, with no landlady tonag us, no quavering voice to call ‘nurse’ in the middle of the night. If wecould have continued like this, the marriage would have lasted for ever.However, there was again the problem of where to live. Finally tired of twohours’ travel a day, I changed my job to a local plastics factory, where Iworked nights; but everyone was expected to work at a tremendous speed and earntime-and-a-half. I preferred to work at my own speed and earn single-time. Aftera few weeks, they sacked me, and I signed on the dole, which was then about £4 aweek.Then we had the idea of making a bid for independence by starting a rug-makingbusiness; Betty bought a loom, and hanks of strong wool, and I spent dayswalking around London’s biggest stores, trying to establish a market for therugs; but they cost too much to make to sell at a profit.Betty advertised for another nurse–housekeeper post, and eventually found one inCourtfield Gardens, Kensington. Her new employer was the retired matron of aprivate nursing home for alcoholics; she had married one of her wealthypatients. Most of the house was let out in rooms, but Mrs Deacon retained alarge flat, where she liked to entertain writers and people from the arts world– provided, of course, that they were successful.We moved in the autumn of 1952, and the next six months proved to be the worstordeal of our married lives. I was still on the dole – jobs were very scarce. Welived in a basement with a minimum of light: the lamps had to be kept on allday. And if our previous employer had been a doddering Tiberius, this one was afemale Caligula. She was insanely neurotic; so much so that she had never beenable to keep a housekeeper for more than a few weeks. She began by accusingBetty of steaming open her letters; Betty, who was rigidly honest, was outraged:there was a quarrel that ended with Mrs Deacon ordering her to leave the room.After this, the woman became steadily more paranoid, and used to shriek atBetty, inventing insane accusations. When I first realised about this bullying,I went upstairs to talk to her; she began very sweetly reasonable, and ended inone of her strange furies, telling me that if we weren’t satisfied, we couldleave the following day. We had spent every penny we possessed moving Betty’sfurniture down from Leicester, so that was out of the question. I wasignominiously forced to climb down and apologise. I went downstairs cursing herwith every drop of hatred in my being; all my natural conceit as a writer and myconviction of my own genius was outraged by her insults. Once more, as in thecase of Mr Penman, the anger seemed to reach a climax, then suddenly drain away,leaving an odd sense of relief. A few weeks later, Mrs Deacon went into hospitalfor an X-ray and they discovered she had a cancer of the womb that would killher in a matter of months. This had no doubt been the cause of her insane rages.For a few days after she had been told the news, our landlady was subdued andgood-tempered; then the rages returned more violently than ever. One day, Bettyheard that she was about to be sacked; she forestalled it by giving notice; ourfurniture was put into storage, and she returned to Leicester with our year-oldson to wait until I could find another home for us.But it was actually the last time we would live together, and I had apremonition of this on Christmas Day, when we had another of our absurdquarrels.I had decided to spend Christmas trying to meditate. Accordingly, while Bettygot the breakfast, I opened a volume of Blake, and tried hard to put myself intoa state of inner calm. I had often done this kind of thing in my teens;sometimes it took all day, but sooner or later, the immense relaxation woulddescend on me, and then, slowly, the old optimism and sense of affirmation wouldawaken. I had not experienced it for a very long time, and Christmas seemed agood opportunity.Unfortunately, I had only been focusing my attention for a few minutes whenBetty came in, asking me if I would look after Roderick for a while. I burst outangrily, and she went away; but meditation was now impossible. I got up feelingguilty, but Betty had retreated into one of her icy, unapproachable moods, andwe hardly spoke all morning. After lunch, when Roderick was asleep, I made anattempt at reconciliation. I often used to read to her; now I suggested that Ishould read her Lawrence’s ‘The Man Who Loved Islands’ – an interesting study ofa paranoiac whose need to be alone becomes so obsessive that he finally buys atiny island and even has the sheep removed. Lawrence intended it as a sermon onthe theme that no man is an island, but I sympathised with his hero, and foundthe ending of the story – with the snow drifting in great banks against his hut– strangely moving. I began to read it to Betty; but after a few pages, sheinterrupted with: ‘This is the most boring story I’ve ever heard. I can’t standanother word of it.’This enraged me; I put on my coat and left the house. It was a grey, coldafternoon, but without snow. I cycled aimlessly down the Earl’s Court Road andKing’s Road to Wandsworth Bridge, and then stood looking at the cold water. Iwas not thinking of suicide; but trying to look inside myself to discover what Ireally wanted, what I ought to do. This deadening frustration had gone on forlong enough. I was thinking about Nijinsky, whose wife had also been an honest,straightforward woman who had failed to understand why he was under such strain.It seemed to me that Betty was always trying to reduce me to some sort of lowestcommon multiple, to work out my motivations in the crudest terms. On thatevening when I had left her flat early, my mind full of Van Gogh, she hadbelieved that I had left to see another girl, and had continued to believe thisafter our marriage, although I told her often enough it was untrue.What was worse, she tried to impose this crude, oversimplified version of mymotives on me, implying that she knew me better than I did myself. Now I thoughtagain about Van Gogh, of that obsessive quest after the purely affirmativevision that ended with the cry ‘Misery will never end’, and I saw that thismarriage was an irrelevant interlude, a long diversion from my purpose; it wouldhave to end. It was not an emotional decision; I suddenly saw it with clarity asa fact that could not be evaded, I felt an immense sense of relief, and began tofeel sorry for Betty. When we were newly married I used to have nightmares inwhich I left her, and I woke up choked with emotion. The nightmares sprang outof self-division; now I had ceased to be self-divided.When we parted, in January 1953, a part of me knew we would never live togetheragain, although we were then on the most affectionate of terms, and I promisedher to find us another home as soon as possible. Betty was in tears when I sawher off."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5> ANARCHISM AND SOHOOne result of our separation was that I suddenly became more involved with theLondon Anarchist Group.I had been a member for the past few months, having first come across them oneSunday afternoon, when Betty and I were taking a walk in Hyde Park. On Speakers’Corner, we heard a red-bearded man preaching anarchism. He seemed to beintelligent and widely read, and when I heckled him, his answers were witty, ifnot convincing. When someone asked him if he thought clergymen really believedwhat they preach, he said: ‘Of course. Their salary depends on believing it.’A week later I returned to speak to him, and asked if I might join the group; hesaid there was no formal membership, but that if I was a convinced anarchist, Iwas welcome as a comrade. His name was Philip Sanson, and he offered to let metry speaking on his platform. So the following Sunday, tense and excited, I wentto Hyde Park. I travelled by tube from Wimbledon, and tried to get out of payingthe full fare by claiming that I had boarded the train much nearer mydestination than I had. The inspector asked me whether the station I had startedfrom had had an escalator or a lift, and I was not able to answer; so I admittedthat I had intended to swindle London Transport. (He took my name, and in duecourse, I received a summons and was fined ten shillings.)This experience stimulated all my anarchistic inclinations, and I began myspeech by telling my audience – a very large one, since other speakers hadattracted it for me – exactly how I had been caught, and advising them on how toavoid paying their fares. This was a huge success; I found it easy to talk inthe open air since I had to shout, and this prevented me from being nervous. Italked for half an hour and doubled the size of the audience. When I climbeddown, several members of the group thumped me on the back, and hauled me off toLyons’s to celebrate on tea and sandwiches. One of them, Tony Gibson, seemedparticularly enthusiastic, and we became friends. But when we rejoined theothers I was told that my speech had not pleased the rest of the group: it mighthave been stimulating, but it was not anarchism. So I was instructed that Iwould have to spend a few months studying Malatesta and Kropotkin before I couldbe allowed to speak again.The truth was that I thought the political theory of anarchism nonsense.Anarchists are, of course, anti-authoritarian; they believe that human nature isbasically good, and that if men were left to themselves, laws would beunnecessary because men would quickly learn to regulate themselves, and crimeand war would vanish.I could see, of course, that one might hope for an increasingly democratic andintelligent society that would finally dispense altogether with authority, butit seemed obvious that in our present stage of political evolution we were notready for it. On the other hand, I felt that the real aim of anarchism was tocreate a society of ‘free spirits’ who would help one another openly andgenerously. This was very close to my heart. It seemed clear to me that thedisease of our civilisation was the self-interest and power mania of businessmenand politicians. I had worked for a while in a large toy factory in Wimbledon,and a few days there had been enough to make me want to destroy the place withdynamite: the workers were expected to work at top speed for every single secondbetween clocking-in and clocking-out; there was no freedom of any kind, and tobe a minute late was a serious offence. A week there had been enough for me. Itseemed to me disgusting that this land of England, that had produced Sir ThomasBrowne and Newton and Shelley, should have come to this: demoniacal, ruthlessmoney-grubbing.Of course, it was because this money-grubbing was a threat to me as a writerthat I hated it so much. The aim of anarchism, as I saw it, was to create anEngland fit for men of talent, and a society whose aim would be theencouragement of individualism.However, the anarchists seemed to feel that my aims were somewhat tooidealistic, and not nearly political enough. So I was banned from theirplatform. I then joined the North London Syndicalist group, who were glad enoughto get speakers and allowed me to say what I liked on their platform.My rather guardedly friendly relations with the London Anarchist Group came toan end when I offered to deliver one of the Tuesday lectures. In a basement nearFitzroy Square, I talked about the late Roman emperors, from Tiberius to Nero,and read them extracts from Suetonius; then I moved on to Jack the Ripper andthe problem of the steady rise in the crime rate. They all thought I intended todraw the moral that power corrupts, but I was far more interested in trying tomake them understand that there is an irrational element in human nature thatwill make the establishment of the anarchist millennium impossible. I drew mytext from Dostoevsky’s Notes from Underground. Half my audience walked out, andthe remainder attacked me violently: one of them said that I had used thelecture to get some sadistic compulsion out of my system, treating the lectureplatform as an analyst’s couch. After that, I saw very little of the group. The breakup of my marriage to Betty was not entirely due to me. I have said thatvarious resentments and strains had built up in the eighteen months we had livedtogether. We were on close terms for a great deal of the time, but a clash oftemperaments had developed. I was sufficiently certain of what I wanted to do towant to be taken at my own valuation. I had spent long enough in my teensfighting self-doubt, imposing self-discipline. If a relationship could not beestablished on my own terms, I was prepared to forgo the relationship. Iclassified myself with Nietzsche, Van Gogh, T. E. Lawrence, Nijinsky, as amystic and an outsider, as someone driven by an evolutionary urge thattranscends normal personal motivations. I do not mean that most of mymotivations are not personal; but there are certain important moments when theyare not.It is also true that the evolutionary obsession can be interpreted as a manicegoism or will to self-assertion. Many would-be artists and rebels can beregarded almost entirely in terms of a will to self-assertion. It is anaccusation that can be made to stick to almost anyone whose motives sometimestranscend the personal. In our quarrels, Betty hurled it at me fairlyfrequently, for example, that when I got carried away by ideas, I talked at herinstead of to her – implying that I had forgotten her presence and was indulgingin a kind of intellectual masturbation, when in fact my chief desire was to gether as interested in the ideas as I was myself, so we might share theexcitement.These were the resentments on my side, and when we had been apart for a coupleof days, I wrote her a letter in which I expressed them. It crossed in the postwith a letter from Betty in which she expressed her own resentments: that I wasbasically selfish and self-indulgent. All that was really happening was that thestrain of eighteen months of continual crisis and worry had vanished toosuddenly, and we were being hurled into violent reaction. Neither of us saw thisat the time. The recriminations went on, and we decided by post that we did notintend to live together again – at least for a long time.I now found a job in the Western Fever Hospital in Fulham, as a – hospitalporter. I was one of about a dozen porters whose job was to receive patients andwheel them to the wards on a stretcher, as well as emptying dustbins, takingmeals to the wards, cleaning windows and generally looking after the maintenanceof the hospital. I was to live in: my room was a cubicle big enough to contain abed and chest of drawers; and by standing on the bed I could see into the nextcubicle, or down the full length of the building. There was not much privacy,but for someone who had been in the RAF this was no hardship.I started in January 1953. The work was easy. We spent most of the day loungingaround the porter’s room waiting for the phone to ring. When this happened, twoof us had to collect a stretcher and move a patient from the ambulance to thereception room, or from the reception room to the ward. No one was overworked –and this was the trouble. The long periods of inactivity were demoralising. Theporters played cards, listened to football matches on the radio, made tea everyhalf hour, and quarrelled among themselves.The place reeked of sex; it was the perfect atmosphere for incubating somefuture Jack the Ripper. The job involved lifting half-naked women on and offstretchers, and walking into wards where the female patients might be wanderingaround with very few clothes. The porters talked of nothing but sex, and atleast one of them pursued nurses and ward maids with some success. A pimply malenurse spent most of his wages on grubby hand-printed booklets of pornographyobtained from a shop behind Leicester Square, and they were passed from hand tohand – I recall one about a man who has sex with his dog, then seduces hisniece.In The Magic Mountain Thomas Mann observes that tuberculosis heightens thesexual urge. My own experience of the T.B. wards confirmed this, but it seemedto be true of most departments of the hospital with which we came into contact.It may be due to the continually felt presence of death. This came home to mewhen I walked into the mortuary one day and saw a particularly attractive younggirl lying naked on the slab. I had seen her alive a few days before; a fewhours later I saw the body after the postmortem, the brains and intestines piledon the end of the mortuary slab, all suggestion of a fellow human being havingnow disappeared. She was the mother of children, and happily married, and Ifound myself asking for the first time, with a real desire to understand: whydid she die? Could I die like that? Are we so unimportant to Nature? Or did shedie because she had no passionate desire to live, no real purpose? Was Shawright when he said we die because we are too lazy to make life worth living?I had one near-mystical experience in the hospital. I was lying on my bedlistening to a concert on the radio; they played the ‘Liebestod’ from Tristanand Isolde, one of my favourite pieces of music. At that time, my admiration forNijinsky often made me improvise a dance to music, as Nijinsky and IsadoraDuncan used to. (It is unnecessary to say that I was always alone when I didthis) So I now stood up and, in the fairly small space between my bed and theopposite wall, began to perform slow, sinuous movements with outstretched arms.As I did this I tensed the muscles of my arms, legs and torso. As the musicreached a climax, it seemed to penetrate the depths of my being, and for a briefmoment consciousness reached a clarity that made me feel I was above time, as ifI could look down on it like a bird on the earth.I remain convinced that what I did that day was to achieve a glimpse of man’sevolutionary possibilities, of freedom from the slow, inevitable movement oftime. Shaw had talked of the necessity for man to live to be three hundred, butcould not suggest a method by which this could be achieved. I feel that the‘timeless moment’ I induced that day by sheer concentration was a flash ofinsight into the answer. The body’s flow in the direction of death could beslowed, or even halted, by using the will as a brake. The anarchists had begun to produce a composite revue of the twentieth centuryjust before the group was split by the poet Herbert Read’s acceptance of aknighthood. I had written parts of it myself. After the schism the idea wasdropped; but I was unwilling to scrap my work, and decided to finish writing itand to find my own cast to perform it. The cafés and coffee houses were full ofrestless art students with no idea of how to kill time. A number of these Irecruited for my revue. A young commercial artist called Jonathan Abraham let ususe his room in Fellowes Road, Hampstead, for rehearsal, and played us jazz andrecords of French cabaret. (He introduced me to the records of Bix Beiderbecke,who is still my favourite jazz trumpeter.) I continued writing the revue as werehearsed it – ‘rehearsing’ meant reading it aloud, for we had no idea of how itcould be staged.Sexually speaking, that summer was almost completely continent. I was chieflyinterested in an eighteen-year-old girl named Laura del Rivo. I also took out afew girls from the hospital. There was a pretty Finnish student called LauraKokalla who was working for the summer as a ward maid. I took her along torehearsals, and sometimes we went out for the day on Sunday, wandering aroundLondon or Surrey. Since Laura spoke very little English, I started to learnFinnish. She was a shy, gentle girl with beautiful skin, and intenselyfrightened of sex. Whenever she started to enjoy being kissed and allowedherself to relax, she would say: ‘We must stop. I am excited.’ And I had to jamon the brakes.An equally pretty German girl called Irmgard Huckmann was more interesting, butjust as frustrating. She was also a student working as a ward maid, and on herfirst evening at the hospital she went out with the porter who was interested innothing but sex. After that, she refused to speak to him, and went out with meinstead. The porter would leer at me and offer to lend me a condom; years later,in Germany, I discovered why. Irmgard had let him get her drunk, after which hetook her to a piece of waste ground behind the hospital and took off herclothes. The experience had disgusted her so much that she determined to stayvirtuous for the rest of her stay in London. This was my bad luck.Irmgard has always stayed in my mind as a symbol of a certain kind of revolt.She had been born in a small German town, Besigheim, in the early 30s, and indue course joined the Hitler Youth. She was so intensely vital that she soonbecame the youth leader, and used to arrange their parades and games. Sheworshipped Hitler; for her, the war was a crusade to make the world a morebeautiful and heroic place. Since Besigheim is a small town, everyone knew herand liked her. And then, quite suddenly, her hero was dead and the war was over,and the town was drab, and everyone was half-starved. Now there was nothing tosatisfy the craving for purpose. She openly mourned Hitler. She agreed thatDachau and Belsen had been horrific, but they had only been the dark side of amagnificent enterprise.She was an exceptionally beautiful girl, with a strong, Slavic face and thickdark hair. She emitted vitality like sparks. But she was a manic-depressive. Onsome days, everything was funny to her: she laughed, joked, wanted to do absurdthings; on other days, she talked of the meaninglessness of life. In this mood,she was also likely to do absurd things. We were standing on Westminster Bridgeone evening, and she gestured at the people: ‘Look at them – dummies, puppets.They are not even half-alive. What would they do if I suddenly took off all myclothes? Or lay down in the middle of the road?’ ‘Why don’t you?’ I said, hopingto see her strip. ‘I’m not afraid.’ She strode out into the traffic, to themiddle of the road, crouched on all fours, and began touching her forehead onthe ground. Nobody seemed to pay much attention, and the traffic was crawlingpast her as if she was invisible. I was relieved when she stood up before thepoliceman on traffic duty spotted her. But she was cheerful for the rest of theevening. I could understand her frustration: she had learned to develop hugereserves of energy, and channel them into things she felt important. Then thechannels had suddenly been closed. She was like a mother without a baby, herbreasts swollen with milk. Five years later, when I was doing a lecture tour inGermany, I saw Irmgard again. The good looks had vanished. The strength of theface was still there, but the vitality had gone; she seemed burned out,listless; she had accepted that civilisation has no room for her kind ofvitality.The girl who occupied most of my thoughts that summer was, as I say, Laura delRivo, whom I met in the Coffee House in Northumberland Avenue. She was notpretty; her face had the flat planes and healthy colouring of Gauguin’spaintings of Breton women. Her voice was sweet and childish, with an accent thatindicated she had been to a good school, and she talked and dressed like atwelve-year-old, in cotton frocks with green and white stripes. The fact thatshe had full breasts and an excellent figure made the schoolgirlishness verypiquant, and made me long to find out if she wore white cotton knickers.I felt she was bored and unhappy, curiously at a loose end. She told me shewanted to be a writer, and I asked her to let me see some of her work. The nextday, we met in a café opposite Charing Cross underground, and she produced hermanuscript. She smoked all the time I read it, and I noticed that the handholding the cigarette was trembling; there was something very tense about her,like a frightened animal. The story was called ‘Emil’ and was obviouslyautobiographical; it was about a Russian youth she had met when she was workingin Foyle’s bookshop. She had become completely infatuated with him, but he wasindifferent to her. The story had a discipline and lack of self-pity that werestartling, coming from an eighteen-year-old.Suddenly, it seemed to me that Laura was the girl I had been looking for:intelligent, completely feminine, devoid of resentments or self-assertion. Theonly thing that bothered me was the fact that I was married, for she was aCatholic and attended mass every Sunday. But when I finally told her I wasmarried, she said casually: ‘Oh, yes.’ That was all. It was typical of Laura;she didn’t even express curiosity.Her unusual personality fascinated me. Emotionally, she was completely innocent,Blake’s ‘soul of sweet delight’ that can never be defiled. I was invited to herhome in Cheam to meet her parents: it was a quiet, secure household, with a longback garden full of apple trees; her father was a bank manager; her youngersister, Lucy, was a pretty, very lively child, and used to sit on my knee whileI told her stories. There was a statue of Saint Joseph on the stairs, and acrucifix on the wall of the sitting room.I began to understand the nature of Laura’s inner conflict. It seemed that hertwelve-year-old mannerisms and teenage frocks were an attempt to stave off theresponsibilities of adulthood. She had enjoyed her peaceful, secure childhood,but physically she was now in an adult world, a world in which you experienced acompulsive urge to leave your innocence behind and give your virginity toimmature young Russians who worked in Foyle’s. Soho fascinated her,intellectually and emotionally. She spent her evenings there, at parties wherecouples would neck until they were obviously in a fever of excitement, and thenhurry to the bedroom; where sixteen-year-olds talked casually about abortions,and drank strong tea, and smoked endlessly – pot when they could get it. Herclosest friend, Olivia, who was seventeen, was having an affair with a plumpCypriot who was much older than she was and already married. Olivia got pregnantbut took something for it, and one night rushed to the lavatory and had amiscarriage. She flushed it down the toilet, spent the weekend in bed, alone,then went to work as usual on Monday.Laura could turn away from this world, which she found so exciting anddisturbing, to the middle-class home at Cheam where nothing had changed sinceher childhood. She told me that as a child she used to roll up into a tight ballin bed and say: ‘Isn’t it nice to be me?’ She still wanted to do this. Shewanted to keep a foot in both camps.Laura was my type, but I, unfortunately, was not hers. She submitted to beingkissed, but she was a bad kisser, and never seemed to know what to do with hernose. She was all tense self-consciousness. On the other hand, she wasphysically fully developed, and when she walked into the Coffee House, the tightgreen sweater she sometimes wore made all the men look up. I had been sexuallydeprived since January, and it was now June; being alone with Laura was acontinual exercise in self-control.One Sunday, in a field near Box Hill, I asked her if she understood why she wasso sexually unresponsive. She said calmly: ‘Oh, yes. It’s because I’m keen onsomeone else.’ The bottom fell out of my stomach. ‘Someone else? Who?’ ‘I can’ttell you that.’ I said: ‘But good God, do you mean to tell me that withEngland’s foremost man of genius kissing you, you can think about anyone else?’She said: ‘But he says he’s a genius too.’ ‘Pooh, the world’s full ofimposters.’ ‘And he’s published, too.’ This was an unkind cut. I asked her theman’s name, but she wouldn’t tell me; she suddenly became tense and reticentagain.Eventually she volunteered the information that he was a journalist and hadpublished poetry. She also mentioned his first name. It was Bill.A week later, we were sitting in a jazz club, and I was talking to a strange,pale-faced girl named Jackie Noble. She was telling us about her boyfriend,Philip Veen, and Philip’s closest friend, Bill Hopkins. She said that Hopkinswas the most brilliant man she had ever come across; that his flow of words wasincredible, and that she had never seen anyone beat him in an argument. I wasstruck by a suspicion. I looked at Laura. ‘Is that the Bill?’ She blushed andlooked away. ‘No.’ But she had said it too quickly. I determined to seek outBill Hopkins and find out if he was all that brilliant.He was not difficult to find, for he was attempting to launch a magazine calledthe Saturday Critic, and half my cast was working for him, sellingsubscriptions. I first saw him in the A and A Club, a taxi drivers’ rendezvous;a crowd of people were sitting and standing round a table, listening to someonetalking. I asked who it was. ‘That’s Bill Hopkins.’ So I hurried over and stoodon the outskirts of the group. He had a pale face, very good-looking in a ScottFitzgerald sort of way, with clean-cut features and a strong jaw. He was arguingwith someone about literature. He certainly had a dominating presence, yet Ifound him disappointing. I had expected a man of calm and discipline, who hadread as much as I had, and who had carefully calculated his assault on theliterary bastions. Instead, I found this intense, good-looking man with aromantic idealism as innocent as Shelley’s, who declared he never read otherpeople’s books because he preferred to be original, and whose taste for rhetoricmade it obvious he was a compatriot of Dylan Thomas.But there could be no denying the immense power of his personality. He seemedborn to be a leader. His humour was so constant and individual that I found itexhausting after the first half-hour or so. By comparison, I seemed sullen andbrooding.I introduced myself to him, but he seemed brusque and absent-minded as he shookmy hand. I said I was a friend of Laura’s, and he looked blank, then said, ‘Oh,yes?’At our second or third meeting I lent him the uncompleted manuscript of Ritualin the Dark. A few days later, I met him in Charing Cross Road. He was wearing ayellow T-shirt stained with red wine, and was in an exuberant mood: but when Iasked about the manuscript, he was evasive. I suspected – rightly – that he hadnot read it. Laura was with me when I met him, and he hardly seemed to noticeher.It was after this that she told me what had happened between them. She had seenBill talking in cafés, and had developed a romantic crush on him. She used towait until it was time for him to go home, for they lived in the same direction– he was in Streatham – and often caught the same bus. They seemed to get onwell enough, but he was apparently not interested in her sexually. And then oneevening as they were walking to the bus, he said seriously: ‘Look here, Laura, Ifind you rather sexually attractive. I’m not in love with you or anything likethat. I’d just like to sleep with you. I promise I wouldn’t talk about itafterwards.’Laura was tongue-tied. She finally said: ‘I’m sorry, I can’t.’ ‘Why not?’ Sheseized the first excuse that came into her head. ‘Because I’m a Catholic.’ Heheld out his hand decisively. ‘Well, goodbye, Laura.’ ‘And he hasn’t paid me anyattention from that day to this,’ she told me. ‘Are you still attracted to him?’She hesitated. ‘I suppose so. I wouldn’t have minded sleeping with him, but heput it so clinically.’This was a knife turning in my bowels. But obviously Laura would be of no use tome while she nursed this passion for Bill. I said: ‘Why don’t you offer to helphim launch the magazine? He told me the other day he needed a typist.’ ‘Hewouldn’t have me, and I wouldn’t ask him.’ ‘Shall I ask him?’ ‘No.’I did, nevertheless. And Bill said testily: ‘No, no, I don’t want that female. Ionce asked her to go to bed with me and she said she was a Catholic. What’s thatgot to do with it? The girl’s a fool.’‘Perhaps you put it a little too bluntly. She’s only eighteen. You probablyscared her.’ He looked thoughtful. ‘Well, if she can type … Tell her to come tothe office one evening.’This was not noble disinterestedness on my part; neither did I want to playpandar. But I was fond of Laura, and it was obvious that Bill had become anobsession. So I gave her Bill’s message, and left them to it.What then happened was what I had expected. Bill re-presented his proposal toher; this time she accepted. They became lovers briefly. But he found herfrightened and shy, and lost interest. I did not see the result of myexperiment; by then I was in France. It had been a frustrating summer.But before all this happened, I walked into the A and A one day and found themanuscript of Ritual in the Dark waiting for me, together with a note that said:‘Welcome to our ranks! You are a man of genius.’Bill had finally got around to opening it, and been struck by the discipline ofthe writing.On the other hand, I found his own writing disappointing when I first saw it. Ashort story was full of vague romanticism: it was about a soldier who is badlywounded in battle, and who has time to fall in love with a beautiful peasantgirl before he dies.The truth was that our standards of writing were completely different: I had‘trained’ under Eliot and T. E. Hulme, and had been equally influenced by Shaw,Yeats and Hemingway. Bill was a self-taught Romantic, writing in a traditionakin to Musset and Hugo. The shade of Hugo seemed to haunt him, and he was oncetold at a spiritualist meeting – which he was reporting for a newspaper – thatthe French poet was standing behind him and wished to present his regards. Thisbrought to my mind Gide’s comment when asked who was the greatest French poet:‘Victor Hugo, alas!’There were times when I suspected that Bill subscribed to Poe’s dictum that themost appropriate subject for poetry is the death of a beautiful woman. A storyhe told me later was somehow typical. In Paris he was asked to help in thesearch for a girl who had disappeared from her parents’ home in Belgium, and wasreported to be making for the Left Bank. He was given a photograph of anexceptionally beautiful girl, and told to comb the cafés. Understandably, hefell in love with the photograph, and spent weeks in feverish search for itsoriginal. Then he was told the search had been called off: the girl’s body hadbeen found buried near her home; a disappointed suitor had murdered her, andthen claimed that she had left for Paris.Bill told me this story in connection with an episode in one of his novels(still unpublished at the time I write). A young and romantic German officergoes into a Polish castle that has been wrecked by shellfire. He enters abedroom that obviously belongs to a girl; her photograph on the dressing tableshows her to be remarkably beautiful. But one wall of the bedroom is missing,and the bed is soaked in blood.I am telling these stories – out of sequence – to illustrate the way in whichBill Hopkins’s imagination works, and also to explain why it was that I foundhis short story disconcerting. His aim has always been to create a certain kindof intensity that has more in common with the German nineteenth-centuryRomanticism than with Hemingway.But the reason that I was immediately fascinated by Bill was that he was thefirst man I had met who was as conceited and as assured of his future greatnessas I was. Soho had disappointed me; I had expected to find a kind of La Bohèmespirit; instead, I found the easily recognisable lack of self-confidence that Ihad thought to be the characteristic of provincial towns; after six months I hadmet no self-professed artist or writer who seemed to rise much above mediocrity.All seemed to be oppressed by some suspicion of future failure – what I latercame to call ‘the fallacy of insignificance’. Moreover, I had not met anyone whoseemed to be seriously determined to produce major work. (Laura was, at thistime, extremely modest about the value of anything she might produce.) Althoughwe live in an age of specialisation, where years of study are required to becomea technician or mathematician, few would-be writers seem to recognise that theirtrade requires an equally long self-discipline.It was true that Bill also seemed to rely largely on native inspiration in hiswriting; but he gave the impression that he had never, in all his life,entertained a moment’s doubt about his future eminence, and about the dignitythat attaches to the destiny of being a writer.It soon occurred to me that his main problem was simple: his immediate personaleffect on people was so great that he might easily have spent his whole lifedazzling a small circle of admirers (who would never cease to assure him of hisgenius) and never writing a line. The temptation was doubled because he comesfrom a family of actors, and he would therefore only be following the familytradition to rely on the spoken rather than the written word. This came to meeven more strongly when I heard him talk for the first time about the plot ofhis novel Time of Totality. As he told it, it was irresistibly dramatic. Theromanticism was welded neatly into a plot that had the movement and economy of aGraham Greene thriller; listening to him, it was impossible to doubt that he hadthe material for a best-selling novel. And yet I had only to cast my mind backto the occasion when he had first outlined to me the plot of his novel TheDivine and the Decay, and then to recall his years of effort in writing andrewriting it, to realise that there can be an immense gap between conception andexecution. (I was, in any case, already aware of this from my own years ofrewriting Ritual.) In telling a story some difficult point is glossed over, somerelationship made to sound more plausible than it will on paper. In writing, aconception that seemed watertight may appear more like a beggar’s coat – moreholes than cloth. There is no alternative but to work and rework, until theoriginal vision is no more than a distant memory.However, in this digression I have left the story of the Saturday Criticsuspended; and yet, when I first met him, it seemed to me – and to many peoplein Soho – that Bill Hopkins was about to become the new Frank Harris, whoseSaturday Review was the most successful periodical of the 1890s. If the SaturdayCritic had ever appeared, the legend of the Angry Young Men would have startedthree years earlier; for the magazine was to be devoted to violent demands forhigher standards in all the arts, and ruthless condemnation of all that failedto meet these standards. (I have no idea how he proposed to keep the goodwill ofhis advertisers.) His army of contributors were all pledged to make the fullestuse of satire, irony and downright abuse in their reviews.Aware that confidence is most easily inspired by an appearance of success, hetook an office in Southwark, close to the tavern from which Chaucer’s pilgrimshad set out, and had two telephones installed. Various publishers sent him booksfor review. Jonathan Abraham drafted a dummy copy of the first number, and thiswas printed with blank pages and a combative editorial explaining the magazine’spolicy.I learned that Bill had worked in Fleet Street since his teens, become a protégéof Beaverbrook, and had at one time edited several local north London newspaperssimultaneously, each one requiring a minimum of effort. The Saturday Criticseemed to have every chance of success. However, the problem was always money,and the free help and the few subscriptions were not enough. Eventually, thewhole scheme collapsed under its own weight.During all my time in Soho I was still speaking on the anarchist platform: infact, since I was the only speaker for the Syndicalist Workers, I kept theirplatform at the hospital, and cycled in with it strapped to my back on Sundayafternoons. Shaw had gained his experience as a public speaker in Hyde Park; itseemed to me the best way to learn to speak to audiences. I had been a gooddebater in my schooldays, but I had lost some of the fluency since I had grownup. I had once tried to make a few comments after a meeting of the TheosophicalSociety – I had been a member for a brief period in my Wimbledon days, but foundtheir thinking too woolly – and my voice shook, and I had to grip the chair infront of me to conceal the trembling of my hands. In the open air, I had toshout, and the nervousness vanished.It was after one of these afternoons in Hyde Park that I had my only sexualexperience of the summer, and it was a disquieting one. In the A and A, I fellinto conversation with an attractive girl who told me she was a Communist. Hername was Kay, and we talked about Russian literature and argued for a while, andthen I walked with her as far as Marble Arch. Here she suggested that I go backto her room for coffee. I knew what she had in mind, and I was willing enough.She lived in a mews flat in Maida Vale. I parked my bicycle outside with theplatform tied to it, and went up. We drank coffee, talked for half an hour, thenI said I’d better be going. ‘Why don’t you stay the night?’ I said I’d like to.So she went off to the bathroom, and I undressed and got into the double bed. Iwas already beginning to feel tense. Kay was not really my type. She wassophisticated, with a drawling upper-class voice, and talked openly about hersexual experiences. She had been married to an actor who had left her foranother woman; since then, she had satisfied her sexual needs by sleeping withvarious men.Her room was sordid. There was an enormous stain on the ceiling shaped like aneye; the wallpaper was peeling; the bedsheets were crumpled, and there was anold menstrual stain on the lower one.Kay strolled in wearing a gauzy nightgown; she had a good figure. She got intobed, and we kissed. Then she touched my erect penis, and said: ‘Wait a moment,’and sat up to take off the nightgown.As she lay down and opened her legs, my excitement collapsed; so did myerection. I said: ‘I’m sorry – it’s overexcitement.’ She didn’t seem to mind;she turned towards me again, and we talked and occasionally kissed; but as faras sexual excitement was concerned, I felt as if I had blown a fuse. Finally, wedozed off for a while. I woke up and felt her pressed against me. The excitementrevived like a tiny spark; I was aware that if I was not careful, it would goout again. I stayed relaxed, tried to direct my thoughts to the girl beside me,and felt the spark turn gradually into a flame. I moved on top of her; luckily,she was easy to enter, and once that much had been accomplished, there was nofurther difficulty. I tried to make up for the earlier failure, and at the endof half an hour we were both exhausted. I made love to her twice more beforemorning.Later in the week, I went to see her in a new flat – she had been thrown out ofthe old one for not paying the rent. We had a meal and went to bed. This time itwas no use. I simply didn’t want her. My body refused to respond in any way atall. And it suddenly came to me what was behind all this. My life with Betty hadproduced a subconscious conflict. Ever since we were first married, the act ofgetting into bed together had aroused an intense physical excitement in me;perhaps her demureness produced a sense of male conquest, of violation. Afterquarrels, it had often been physical contact that had started thereconciliation. But the more we quarrelled, the more a part of me didn’t want tobe reconciled, so that I began to apply an automatic brake to the excitement shearoused in me. The brake had become a habit, and it was working with otherwomen.It was frustrating to be unable to control my physical responses, yet I feltless defeated about it than I might have. My inability to respond to Kay made memore aware of the things I did hold valuable. Human beings were not intended forthis insipid lovemaking: > Those who sit in the stye of contentment, meaning> Death> Those who suffer the ecstasy of animals meaning> Death.Mathematics, music, the mystery of the universe and of human existence: thesewere what really mattered, not this sensual girl whose hips worked like amachine.A few evenings later, I was talking in the A and A with a friend of Bill Hopkinsnamed John. I was due to see Kay, but since we were having an interestingdiscussion, I invited him to come along with me. We went to Kay’s flat in PercyStreet. John was telling me about the problems he was encountering with a novel;I was explaining my difficulties with Ritual. Kay made tea for us and we carriedon talking. Then Kay turned the conversation to sex, and at some point my friendadmitted he was a virgin. Kay was delighted. Towards midnight, I said I had togo. Kay said: ‘Well, I’ve got to sleep with somebody …’ We both looked at John,who blushed. But he stayed. I saw Kay a few days later and asked what he hadbeen like. ‘Fantastic. He nearly killed me.’I made no further attempt to sleep with her. But I found myself wondering if Iwould fail as ignominiously if it was Laura who was in bed beside me.My Twentieth Century Revue was finally presented some time in July 1953. Wehired a hall near Holborn, a large upstairs room of a café called The Garibaldithat the anarchists used sometimes. We had put up advertisements in all thecoffee houses, and we had a large audience. We read it aloud, seated around atable; it went on for two hours, and was more successful than we had expected.We charged no admittance, but the money donated for coffee and cakes also paidfor the hire of the room.Afterwards, the cast was gloomy. They had been rehearsing for months, and nowfelt the anticlimax. Soho was not really the vital, bohemian place that ourelders assumed it was. Most of the younger generation were bored and onlyvaguely rebellious. Bill Hopkins and I had produced a certain discipline for amonth or so, offered a centre of gravity to draw them together and give themsomething to do. Now the revue was over, and the Saturday Critic was alreadyencountering production difficulties, the old aimlessness was back. The casturged me to write them a play, and I began The Metal Flower Blossom, about aSoho artist and his involvements with his models. (Parts of it were laterincorporated into my second novel, Adrift in Soho.)The trouble was that this required far more rehearsal and coordination than arevue, and they were not willing to give it that much attention. Half of themwere always absent from rehearsals. One day, Laura and I decided that we wouldskip a rehearsal and get drunk. Neither of us had ever been drunk before – I hadnever been able to afford it. We went into Henekey’s wine bar in the Strand, anddrank several glasses of cheap burgundy, then took another bottle with us to thegardens of the newly built Festival Hall, and drank it on a seat overlooking theriver. At first the effect was disappointing, but by the time the bottle wasempty, we were undoubtedly drunk.We walked to the Coffee House in Northumberland Avenue and drank black coffee;and then, crossing Trafalgar Square, Laura was sick in one of the fountains.After a few minutes, a disapproving policewoman came over and told us we werecausing a scene. I looked up and saw that a crowd had gathered and was watchingus. I travelled to Cheam with Laura, delivered her home, then caught the lasttrain back to Fulham. Waiting for a connection at Putney Bridge, I too wassuddenly violently sick in the bushes. The next day, I felt exhausted, and had aheadache. It happened that I had been chosen for a particularly strenuous jobthat day – the window-cleaning detail. I got through the day somehow, and sworeI would never repeat the folly.I didn’t enjoy life in Soho; there was too much meaningless activity. When Laurastarted working for Bill – dropping out of The Metal Flower Blossom – I decidedit was time to return to France. I was tired of the hospital, and bored – sobored that no amount of spare-time activity could stop me feeling as if I wasrotting, spiritually and mentally. Somehow, a mere five minutes in the porters’room could reduce my thoughts to a repetitive babble. I made tremendous effortsagainst it, but it was no use; I stewed in my own apathy. I frequently sneakedoff to a room above the laundry, sat cross-legged on the dusty floor (breathingin a smell of dead mice) and tried to concentrate on the Gita and on freedom. Iwas haunted by an image from Lancelot Cranmer-Byng’s Vision of Asia, a pictureof ‘Corea, the Land of Morning Calm’ – an idea not without ironic implicationsin 1953 – and of three old men standing in a green basin in the hills, eachtasting a jar of vinegar. Buddha finds it sour, Confucius is calm andindifferent; Lao-Tzu looks delighted. The brew, of course, is life.This image filled me with sick longing as I breathed in the dust, and then wentdownstairs again to hear the same conversations about football and sex, andwatch the endless card games. It was history that had died for me. I had anunusual degree of freedom; the work was easy; I had many friends; but my mindwas like a mouse in a bucket that cannot climb over the sides, and can only leapup and then fall back to the bottom.At about this time the Christie murders were discovered, and the newspapers werefull of photographs of detectives digging up the back garden of 10 RillingtonPlace. Reg Christie was a middle-aged sex maniac, impotent except withunconscious women; so he persuaded a succession of women that he could curecatarrh by getting them to breathe in a potion of Friar’s Balsam in hot water.Once their heads were under the blanket he introduced a rubber hose attached tothe gas tap and waited for them to collapse; then he raped and strangled them.The bodies were found by his landlord in a large kitchen cupboard after Christiehad left the house, and for days the newspapers were filled with the hunt forthe sex murderer.These murders seemed to symbolise for me the sordidness and futility of my lifein the hospital. I drove myself on by willpower, but I could not recover thedelight and confidence of that summer of working on farms. I now oftenremembered that day of my last holiday with Mary, on the windy hillside inDerbyshire, and the sheer exultation I had felt as we were blown downhill. Wasit, I wanted to know, possible to re-create this exultation at will?And here I was in a job that brought me constantly into contact with sickness,aware of the moral consequences of our stagnation in the porters’ room, andmaking no real effort to escape. My mind was like a wet tinderbox that no sparkcan ignite.One day I met in Northumberland Avenue an old acquaintance, John Drury, from theVaughan College in Leicester, who congratulated me on looking so healthy andfull of energy. I was interested in this observation, for I had beendeliberately driving myself for many months, refusing to acknowledge exhaustion;yet I was aware of an immense listlessness inside me.Two events led to my deciding to leave the hospital and return to France. Thefirst was renewed turbulence in the relationship with Betty. One weekend I wentto Leicester and found that my parents had invited Betty – she was living againwith her mother – in an attempt to reconcile us. They had put us into the samebed but I was determined not to make love. Then, halfway through the night, Iwoke up with my penis erect and tingling with excitement. Betty was lying on herback, and I realised that her finger was touching my penis. From this there wasan electrical flow of energy. It was obvious that she was fast asleep. Thenafter perhaps ten minutes, she raised her knees, and I reached out and let myhand rest on the stretched cotton at the bottom of her nightdress. Another fiveminutes, and she had stretched out her legs again, so my hand took thenightdress with it. I touched her between the thighs, and found she wascompletely moist. Afraid of waking her, I climbed on top of her, and my penisslid inside her. She woke up and said: ‘What are you doing?’ and I felt likelaughing and saying: ‘What the hell do you think?’ Then she became excited too,and I reached orgasm before I could withdraw. She said: ‘I wasn’t prepared.’At that moment Roderick woke up, and Betty asked me to go downstairs and warmthe bottle. While I waited for the water to boil, I sat on the back doorstep,and reflected that I seemed to be caught in the spider’s web again.The next day, I took Roderick out for a walk in his pram. I walked over SpinneyHill Park, then decided to go and show the baby to Millicent, who lived nearby.I knew, of course, that Betty disliked her – for revealing the secret of why wegot married – but felt sure she could hardly object to me taking myeighteen-month-old son to see her.I was wrong. When I got back she was furious, and snatched up Roderick andmarched off home, leaving me baffled at the sheer illogicality of the reaction –after all, Roderick could not even talk. However, I followed her, and we had areconciliation, and agreed to make a joint effort to find a home for ourselvesin London.I was not entirely happy about this, for while I loved my wife and son I had noparticular wish to repeat the experience of the previous year. However, Bettyborrowed money from her mother; I registered with an agency that offered to findus a flat for five pounds, and we started the search for a home again. Theagency offered us a flat in Forest Gate, East London. I went to see it and likedit; they wanted one hundred and twenty pounds for ‘furniture and fittings’, butthe rent was low – two pounds ten shillings a week. I gave the agent a chequefor fifty pounds as a deposit, and sent for Betty to come and see it.She was reluctant – she thought the premium high, and was suspicious of theterms of the agreement: the lessor refused to allow her to take the agreement toa solicitor. However, she finally agreed to the price, and returned toLeicester.Later the same day, back in my hospital room, I received a telegram from hertelling me that she had changed her mind, and wanted to call the whole thingoff. I was furious. I had taken a great liking to the woman who offered us theflat – a plump Irish Catholic who was completely charming – and had told herthat we would quite definitely be taking it. I sent her Betty’s telegram, with aletter of apologies – she returned our fifty pounds by the next post – and Iwrote to Betty saying that if she wanted a flat now, she could look for itherself. But I suspect I was also relieved that things had turned out as theyhad.I had another reason for wanting to leave London. Exhaustion was bringing oncurious attacks of dizziness, probably due to low blood pressure, like the one Ihad experienced as a teenager in Leicester. One day in my bedroom in thehospital, I stood up and yawned. Everything dissolved; in a half-conscious stateI groped about the floor, aware of a curious trickling noise in my head andears, and of separation from my body and all I called ‘myself’. My identitydissolved; there was nothing left to hang on to; I was ‘conscious, but consciousof nothing’. Then my head cleared, but as I went downstairs to work, theordinary world seemed a mockery, a pointless ritual of machines.A few days later it happened again, on the deserted upper deck of a bus, as Iwas returning from seeing Laura in Cheam. I stretched and yawned, and becameunconscious. I knew that this was because I was causing the blood to rush frommy brain, but this was no answer to the sense of horror, the feeling that allhuman life was futile.It occurred once more when I returned home late one night, a little drunk, andlay in bed in the warm darkness. Abruptly, I felt a sense of the absurdity ofbeing there. It was suddenly very clear. I wanted to ask: who am I? What am Idoing here? What lies beyond life? We take this world in which we live forgranted, as if it were the most ordinary and reasonable thing to be alive. Whatguarantee have we that we are not sitting in an execution chamber? For us,‘life’ is all there is, but we are not afraid because there is always somealternative, some ‘beyond’ around the corner. But since we are living beings,what alternative is there to life? I suddenly felt like a rat in a trap, and itseemed that our stupidity and incomprehension were all that lay between us andsome ultimate horror.The irony was that all these questions were irrelevant to my life. If theforeman said: ‘Why are you looking ill this morning?’ could I reply: ‘Because Isuspect that all life is false’ or ‘Because I suspect you are a delusion of mybrain’?As I saw it: we cannot live except as human beings, pursuing the human ritual;all we do must be ‘human’; we must travel along our tramline of time, and maketime pass by various purposes that all relate to other people. We seem to beindividuals; in fact, we cannot even breathe for ourselves; every act ofself-expression of which we are capable is a human, a social, act.It seemed to me that I was like a slot machine, standing on some corner andbelieving itself free, believing that it stands there of its own free will anddisgorges each packet of cigarettes by an act of volition. Suddenly I hadrealised that ‘I’ was wholly mechanical, depending entirely on coins inserted byother people, that therefore no act of mine was meaningful, that I could claimto be nothing more than an observer, a witness of life, consciousness trapped inmatter but completely helpless – helpless even to observe except by the body’sgrace, which might cut off consciousness at any moment.Plainly, there was nothing to be done about such a vision, but it saps thedelusions that keep us moving. It seemed to me that the only sensiblealternatives were suicide or leaving the hospital. Neither would be as sensibleas simply not being, but since I ‘was’, I had no choice in the matter.I sold all my books at Foyle’s, collected together all the money I could muster,and wrote to Betty to tell her that I was on my way to France. (This meant that,technically speaking, I had ‘left’ her, although we had in fact been separatedfor nine months.) I spent a night sleeping on the floor of Bill’s office inSouthwark, and hitch-hiked toward Dover at a leisurely pace the next day. Thefollowing night I slept in a wood near Canterbury – in a sleeping bag, of course– and was up early the next morning, prepared to see what life had to offernext."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6> JOYBy midday I was back in France. This time, I had a little more money than I hadhad before – a few pounds. I went into a restaurant in a great barnlike placenear the docks, and ordered a meal and some wine. I had not yet had breakfast.The wine soon made me drunk and happy; the place was decorated with paperstreamers, and the radio was playing Spanish music very loud. I was given animmense and tender steak. For the first time for a year – it seemed to be manyyears – the joy welled up in me, the strength of the powerhouse, as it had onthe windy Derbyshire hillside, and I was certain I had made the right decisionin leaving England. I felt that the gods were back with me again, and had sentme this glimpse of power as a sign of approval. I was in Spain and Calais andall over Europe at the same time; I could catch history like a bus.Two days later I arrived in Paris, and went straight to the room of ClaudeGuillaume in the rue Bayen. He no longer lived there, but his mother kept theroom on for her occasional visits to Paris. The concierge had been told to giveme the key; so I moved in.The first problem was to find some way of making a living. It looked as if Imight have found a solution on my first evening in Paris, when I saw anadvertisement for a new American magazine called the Paris Review. I went tovisit the editor in his office in the rue Garanciere; he proved to be aclean-cut young American called George Plimpton.George suggested that I should sell subscriptions for the Paris Review, keepinga large share for myself. He supplied me with a list of Americans living inParis, and a map of the city.It seemed an excellent idea. The subscriptions cost a thousand francs each(about one pound in 1953), of which I would retain four hundred francs. Thismeant that I could live by selling only one or two subscriptions a day. I wentback to the rue Bayen in a very cheerful frame of mind.The next day I discovered that the work would be harder than I had anticipated.To begin with, the addresses on my list were often a long way apart: I wouldeither have to pay heavily in bus fares, or walk. Secondly, very few Americansseemed to be interested in a new literary magazine. After a long day’s work, andwalking about twenty miles in oppressive heat, I had sold one subscription, buthad spent about a thousand francs on cool drinks and bus fares. When theaddresses were on the telephone, I tried ringing them up, but discovered thatthis method of approach was hardly ever successful; it was too easy for thepotential client to make an excuse and hang up.One American told me to call the next day at his office. But his home addresshappened to be very close to the rue Bayen, so I called there on the off chanceof selling him a subscription on my way home. He came to the door and, when Itold him my business, shouted: ‘I thought I told you to come to my office! Whatthe hell do you think I am! If you want to see me, you’ll do it my way! Now getout!’ He slammed the door in my face. I stood there, feeling the same hatredthat I had once felt for the landlady at Courtfield Gardens, and invoking allthe gods to bring on him the nastiest and messiest death possible. I went homewondering why it is that Americans can be the vilest and rudest people on earth,as well as the most charming.After a few days I found various means of supplementing my income. The mostuseful was to sell individual copies of the magazine to possible subscribers whowanted more time to make up their minds. Many people were unwilling to part witha full year’s subscription but were happy enough to buy a single copy. As far asmy job went, this was strictly ‘illegal’, but I had to live; and I felt thatGeorge Plimpton had misled me about the profits to be made.About two weeks after I arrived Laura wrote to me to say that Bill Hopkins mightbe on his way over to look for a French printer for the Saturday Critic. I spentthe next day in my room, hoping he might turn up. I was glad enough of anopportunity to read poetry and Shaw’s plays, for I detested knocking on doors.But there was no sign of him, so the next day I went out and left a note on thedoor, saying I would be back at six o’clock. Still no one came, so the next day,I stayed in, and read. Towards seven in the evening there was a faint knock onmy door. It was Bill’s friend Philip Veen, who told me that he and Bill had beenwaiting on the pavement downstairs all the afternoon. They had arrived atmidday, seen my note (which I had forgotten to remove) and assumed I was not athome.I was delighted to see them, for Paris had me in a defeated frame of mind. Bill,as usual, was a tonic. He also had no money. Philip had to return to London thefollowing day – he had come for a weekend trip – and we discovered that we hadjust enough for his fare by clubbing together. Bill decided that he would stayin Paris and sell subscriptions with me until we had enough money to return toEngland. Things would be different now, he said; a little fast sales talk wasall that was needed to make us rich.In this he proved to be over-optimistic. We tried the address of every Americanin the Champs Élysées, sold half a dozen copies of the magazine, and took one ortwo subscriptions. But Bill was a non-stop smoker and I ate large quantities ofchocolate, so the money soon vanished – including George Plimpton’s share of thesubscriptions. We saw George that evening and explained to him that we had beenforced to ‘borrow’ the money, and handed him the addresses of the newsubscribers. We were also introduced to the editors of the small English reviewcalled Merlin – and met a cadaverous young poet called Christopher Logue. Wedecided to add Merlin to our subscription drive, and equipped ourselves with alarge armful of copies of the magazine. The Merlin subscriptions, like those forthe the Paris Review, had to be impounded to feed us, but we did not starve.We shared the room in the rue Bayen, taking turns sleeping on the bed. Bill is anight worker; he would often type (on Time of Totality, a novel that was neverto be finished) until three in the morning, and then wake me up and insist ontaking a walk round the empty boulevards.In the long discussions on our temperaments and methods, each of us was frankabout his low opinion of the other’s approach. I felt, with instinctiveresentment, that Bill was patronising me. Since I had worked for years on theassumption that I was the only important writer in Europe this astounded me. Iwas glad enough to acknowledge him as the only potentially great writer I hadever met, but to be aware that he did not regard me in the same light wasirritating. Consequently, I was as candid as I could be about the defects of hisown writing, about his lack of serious discipline, and about the time he wastedon trying to influence people directly – either by conversation or in themagazine – instead of concentrating on creating major works.He in his turn declared that I was too subjective and introverted, and that thisrevealed my fear of having my conviction of superiority shattered by contactwith other people.We wrangled for days, and ended in a kind of agreement, both partiallyacknowledging the justice of the other’s criticisms. We ended by achieving adegree of respect and liking for one another that has never changed. (After thesuccess of The Outsider, a few mischief-making critics enjoyed suggesting thatBill was one of my ‘followers’, but this was as absurd as suggesting that I wasone of his. We regarded one another in every sense as equals.)We were also in agreement that a new phase of modern literature had begun whenwe decided to form an alliance. Certain misunderstandings were also aired andcleared up and all this left us feeling optimistic, and we often celebrated along day of selling subscriptions with a few bottles of cheap wine at theexpense of the Paris Review.Still, this did nothing to advance the fortunes of the Saturday Critic. So afterseveral weeks of working on our respective novels and drinking with the Merlincrowd in the Café Tournon, we decided that the British Consulate must once againbe called upon for repatriation. It was a hard decision: I had come to Pariswith every intention of living there. Chris Logue and the rest of the Merlinwriters managed to make a thin living from teaching English, and they offeredsome helpful advice. (When Claude Guillaume arrived unexpectedly at the rueBayen one day, Bill spent the following night sleeping – or trying to sleep – onLogue’s floor, and listening to an interminable sonnet sequence until dawn.This, I think, hastened the decision to return to England.)So in late November, after a mere two months in Paris, I returned. I had noheart for London, and in any case, had no money to find a room. I stayed for afew days with a Hungarian acquaintance, Alfred Reynolds, who had recently movedinto a house in Dollis Hill; he ran a kind of humanistic political group whichhe called Bridge and preached a gospel of absolute tolerance to a group of youngmen once a week. I stayed long enough to attend one meeting, decided that thiskind of vague and unspecific tolerance had nothing to teach me, and went on toLeicester.The Labour Exchange directed me to Lewis’s, the department store in the centreof town. They needed temporary salesmen for the Christmas rush and I wasallotted to the carpet department.I had come to Leicester hoping vaguely that fate might have changed its policytowards me. It seemed to me that I had been a dissatisfied wanderer for as longas I could remember, either enduring futile jobs, or drifting at a loose end. Ifelt myself a perpetual misfit. And yet it was not because I had the temperamentof a drifter or a bohemian. All I wanted was a room lined with books and enoughmoney to live on tinned tomatoes and fried eggs. But for years now, the patternof my life had been repetitive: finding myself in situations that grew slowlyunbearable, breaking away, and then landing in another situation that slowlywent sour.The trouble, I suppose, was my introversion. Life in modern society means mixingwith other people, and I didn’t want to. The few jobs I had really enjoyed hadbeen jobs in which I was allowed to work alone – at Frazer and Glass, in NorthFinchley, I had worked in a spraying shed half a mile from the main factory, andoften saw no one all day. The woven rug business I had tried to set up withBetty would have been ideal. As it was, I saw I was going to be forced to stickat jobs until they bored me, then go and look for another.Still, working at Lewis’s was not disagreeable. The manager questioned me forhalf an hour on the morning I applied for the job; he was obviously ratherintrigued by someone who had moved around as much as I had. But he ended bytaking me on, emphasising that it was on a temporary basis – for I was obviouslynot ‘respectable’, and didn’t even possess a suit. The work was enjoyableenough. The Christmas rush kept us busy. The loudspeakers blared carols all day,and I liked the other salesmen in my department.My first day was spent in a classroom at the top of the building, learning touse a cash register. There were two other trainees: one was a mild youth whom Ihave forgotten, the other, a young army officer named Martin Halliday, who had asquare, clean-cut face, close-cropped blond hair, and a public school accent.I found the girl who taught us about the cash register intriguing. Travelling upto the classroom in the lift, it had struck me that she was vaguely the sametype as Betty, although the oval face reminded me of Mary. In profile, she wasnot especially pretty, her nose being perhaps too Roman, but as soon as shesmiled, this impression vanished, for her smile was dazzling, and gave animpression of extraordinary sweetness and good temper.I expected her to have the awful Leicester accent, which I hated, but when shespoke her accent was that of a well-educated middle-class girl, althoughcompletely free of the nasal drawl to which well-educated young women are prone.I was more interested in watching her than listening to what she had to sayabout the cash register; she was slim, rather tall for a girl, and had agraceful way of moving. The ex-army type remarked afterwards that he liked theway she braced her legs slightly apart, and turned from the waist to gesturetowards the board behind her. It made the black skirt stretch across the thighsin an interesting manner, so that one couldn’t help speculating what she wouldlook like without it. I thought I noticed a wedding ring on her finger, andremember thinking that she must give her husband a great deal of pleasure. MrsBatty, the lady in charge of the teaching department, called her ‘Miss Stewart’,but that meant nothing, since all the girls were addressed as ‘Miss’.As I watched her, my heart sank. Two or three years earlier I would have becomehopelessly infatuated, but now I realised there was probably no point, andsuppressed the feeling immediately. Six months’ frustrating pursuit of Laura hadtaught me that much self-discipline.At lunchtime, I ate in the staff canteen with Halliday, and found himinteresting. He also had the rolling-stone temperament. He had spent three yearsin the army – after the war, of course – having trained at Sandhurst. He likedthe army; he liked the idea of discipline. Civilians struck him as unbearablysloppy. (He stared with disapproval at my chin – I had not bothered to shavethat morning.) He suspected that life as a civilian was going to be tiresomelydevoid of challenge.We discussed our teacher. He told me her name was Joy, and that she was a friendof the girl he was at present hoping to get into bed – another trainee managercalled Pat. Joy was apparently not married, but she was engaged to someone shehad been at university with, and expected to marry him soon. (I must havemistaken the engagement ring for a wedding ring.) That was much as I expected;girls like that were not left lying around for long. Joy and her fiancé intendedto move to Canada where they would be married.That evening, when I left work, Halliday suggested we go and have a drink. Ididn’t have much money, but I could afford a couple of pints, so we went intothe hotel opposite Lewis’s. When we had both drunk a pint, he seemed to relaxand become happier. He told me to call him Flax – the nickname was obviously dueto the colour of his hair – and we ordered a second pint; he also insisted onbuying two whiskies. Obviously, he missed the companionship of the officers’mess; I was a second-best, but better than nothing.There began immediately a kind of ‘will-to-power’ struggle between us. I agreedthat discipline was important, but I detested the armed forces and everything todo with them. The only kind of discipline that mattered was the self-disciplineof dedicated men. T. E. Lawrence proved that the intellectual will-to-powercould be geared to physical purposes, but the physical will-to-power cannot riseabove its own level.Flax disagreed with me; he said he had never met an intellectual who was notalso a weakling. We went on arguing, and we moved to another pub, where we atesandwiches, for which he paid – I had now run out of money. I found his mystiqueof power interesting. He had noted that certain army officers, sons of rich ortitled men, seemed to give orders without effort, and were obeyed mainly becausethey took it for granted they would be. One day in the mess, the son of a dukehad called across to him: ‘Halliday, get some more drinks,’ and he was on hisway back with the tray before it struck him that the form of the request hadbeen hardly polite, and that he ought to have been offended.He was intelligent: there could be no doubt about that. I argued – we were inour third pub – that physical existence was futile and repetitive, and that onlythe power of the mind could leave a permanent mark on human existence. He thenbegan to expound his own metaphysical theory: that acquired experience was notlost, that in some strange way every evolutionary advance made by every livingcreature was stored up in a kind of universal computer, and the computer mightbe what the mystics call God. It was a curious kind of monistic idealism.He suggested we go back to his place, where he had some bottled beer. It was ahouse in New Walk, within easy reach of Leicester’s town centre; the upstairswas unoccupied and Flax lived in a single room with an attached kitchendownstairs. We stood in the upstairs room in the freezing darkness, and watchedthe woman in the next house undressing. He told me she always did it about thesame hour, without drawing the curtains, and he strongly suspected that she knewhe watched her. In fact, when she had finished, he openly turned on the lightbefore we went downstairs to a sandwich and more beer.There he went on outlining his basic power theory: his notion that the forcethat holds society together is the will of dominant human beings, and that thiswill is fundamentally mystical in nature. He cited Hitler as an example, andlater gave me his copy of Mein Kampf inscribed ‘Halliday to Wilson’. He feltthat the foundation of modern society is rotten, since our civilisation fails toprovide enough challenge for the men of power, and a man can develop onlythrough surmounting a series of challenges. (I noted here the same basicfrustration I had observed in Irmgard.)He spoke with admiration of certain officers who played Russian roulette with arevolver, or who would offer to prove they were not drunk by spreading theirfingers out on a tabletop and stabbing between them at an incredible speed witha sharp stiletto. He told me that one of them had missed, and pinned his hand tothe table. He produced his own army revolver, and told me that he had onceplayed Russian roulette with it. Then, as he sat fingering it, he asked mecasually to pass him a pipe that lay on the floor beside my chair. As I bentover, there was a deafening explosion, and the wood of the cupboard near my nosesplintered. I picked up the pipe and handed it to him as if nothing hadhappened. ‘Hmmm, your nerves are good,’ he said, peering into the smokingrevolver.The will-to-power argument led on to sex, a subject that fascinated him aboveall others. A healthy male is naturally a stallion, he explained (a view withwhich Bill Hopkins would have concurred). There is a magic about women thattouches his deepest springs of will. (‘What is life without conquest?’ I hadmade Jesus ask, in a story I had written about the crucifixion.) But no one hasever written honestly about this aspect of sex – certainly not Lawrence orJoyce.Artists were not qualified to write about it, Flax insisted, because they werebasically weak, romantic. Who had ever really written honestly about the detailsof seduction, the physical minutiae; about the way that a girl may allow a manto slip his hand into the waist of her skirt at the back as he is kissing her;and, if she is not wearing an underskirt, into the elastic of her knickers? Thisstrikes her as natural, while an attempt to fondle her breast or unzip her skirtmight frighten her into frigidity. If the skirt waistband is elasticated, shemight even allow him to caress her buttocks, still without feeling that he isgoing too far.In the same way, girls feel it less of a liberty for a man to kiss their breaststhan to caress them. A shy girl in a swimsuit would not be unduly alarmed if theman she had only allowed to kiss her goodnight placed his head on her breasts,then turned sideways and pressed his lips to them, then slipped off the shoulderstrap so he could suck the nipple. It is his hands she worries about, then hispenis, and it never strikes her that his mouth, used upon her breasts orgenitals, can bring about her undoing more effectively than either of these.(I later put a portrait of Flax into a book of mine called The World ofViolence, and included some of his sexual theories; but my publisher cut themout.)I left him after the last bus had gone, and walked unsteadily home. He remindedme of certain officers described in Russian fiction of the nineteenth century:Pushkin’s Herman, Tolstoy’s Dologhov, Lermontov’s Pechorin. And the significantthing about these three is that they are basically tragic. Flax was basically anineteenth-century romantic.I was sorry when our brief training period in the classroom was over, since itmeant that I would have no more opportunity to see Joy. But at coffee break thatmorning, I was sitting with Flax when she came in. Flax asked her to come andsit with us. I said very little; I was more interested in listening to the soundof her voice, and watching the smiles that transformed her face as completely assunlight passing over a lake. Flax seemed to be on familiar terms with her; headdressed her as ‘Joy’ and asked after the health of her ‘rock-tapper’ – herfiancé was apparently a geologist.I remember looking at her and thinking: a few years ago, I would have allowedmyself to get completely moonstruck by her; now I have enough self-discipline toknow there is no point in wanting something you can’t have. I envied Flax hisbachelor’s flat; he was already working out the details of his plan of campaignto seduce Joy’s friend Pat in several easy stages. The first was to get Joy tojoin the two of us for a drink, and then invite her back to the flat. Then Patcould be asked back too. And then perhaps the two girls might be persuaded tostay there over a weekend.When Flax left me alone with Joy for a moment, I asked her when she had leftuniversity. She said a year before. ‘How old are you?’ I asked, half-expectingher to tell me to mind my own business, but she said, ‘Twenty-one.’ I wasastonished. Perhaps because she reminded me in some respects of Betty, perhapsbecause of her poise and self-possession, I had assumed her to be in hermid-twenties. If she was younger than I, perhaps the poise was only skin-deep,and I could make some impression after all.Later that day, I had an idea. Why not organise some kind of Christmas show –perhaps a production of the Twentieth Century Revue that I had written for theanarchists, or my Metal Flower Blossom – and try to get her to take a part init? It would enable me to see her without having to rely on Flax. I already feltthat he was capable of being capricious.At the next opportunity, I suggested the idea to the manager. He agreedimmediately – on condition that he be allowed to see the script. I thenapproached Joy. She seemed doubtful; she said she couldn’t act, but wouldperhaps take a minor part. I chortled, and put on Bill’s favourite expression ofthe villain alternately twisting his moustache and rubbing his hands.I went along to see Betty at her home near Hinckley, and there was vague talk ofliving together again. But when a relationship has been broken and stucktogether again as many times as ours had, it becomes as unserviceable as apatched saucepan.Thinking back on our quarrels, I suddenly recognised their basic cause. It wasan insight I owed to Flax: it was all a question of dominance. I suppose that Itake after my father in being of fairly high dominance. Betty’s nine-yearseniority and her years of independence had also developed a dominance in herthat was acquired, a shield against the world rather than something natural. Itoverlaid her naturally feminine and dependent personality. The Betty I loved wasthe feminine essence; the Betty with whom I quarrelled was the dominant alterego.Now I thought about it, this question of dominance seemed the key to a greatdeal of human nature. The inner conflicts of my teens had been due to my attemptto turn my dominance inwards, into ideas. The weight of my literary talent wasdue to this dominance turned into ideas. Like Flax, I had a natural tendency tofeel that all artists or thinkers must be sissies. As a child I had been a goodscrapper and a natural leader, although I hated sport. I had inherited from myfather a natural ability to use my fists, and he had even tried to teach me therudiments of boxing. Under different circumstances, perhaps in a different age,I would have developed naturally into a man of action. The dominance had turnedinwards, and I was outwardly mild and unquarrelsome. So I fitted easily intoordinary jobs, and at first my employers were always impressed by myintelligence, which seemed to predict that I would go far. But the dominanceunfitted me for ordinary work: it made me contemptuous of the people I workedwith, who – aware only of the mild exterior – reacted by feeling a naturalresentment.Obviously, the dominance syndrome explained my complex relation with BillHopkins; it also explained why I found Flax interesting. We were amusing eachother with a game of clash of wills, like a friendly sparring match; and everytime I looked at him, I could see that, under different circumstances – perhapsif, like Flax, I had been born of middle-class parents – I might have been verymuch like him.The dominance syndrome certainly explained why Shaw meant more to me than anyother writer; all his plays are about the clash of wills; and one in particular– Major Barbara – is about the clash between a man whose dominance has beendirected mainly at other people (Undershaft), and a man in whom it has beenforced inwards into intellectuality (Cusins). And significantly, Shaw writes ofthe latter that the ‘chronic strain … has visibly wrecked his constitution’. Myhealth was, fortunately, still unimpaired, except for stomach upsets, but itwould obviously not remain unimpaired if the chronic strain of unfulfilmentlasted too long.The dominance theory also explained why Joy attracted me so enormously. A fewevenings after I started at Lewis’s, she came out for a drink with the two ofus, and we ended back in Flax’s place. In close contact with her, it was easy tosee that the soft voice and the sweet smile indicated her basic disposition:gentle, good-tempered and – oddly enough – rather vague. She seemedunoffendable. At one point in the evening, Flax asked her casually: ‘Are youstill a virgin, Joy?’ and she looked embarrassed and said, ‘That’s the kind ofthing I don’t talk about,’ but she said it without reproach, almostapologetically. Her background was middle-class: her father was an accountant;she had attended Trinity College, Dublin, taken a degree in French, and gotengaged to an Irishman with the same kind of background as herself. The apparentgrace and poise were natural, not acquired, and they concealed her shyness. Likemyself, she had spent a great deal of her childhood curled up in corners with abook. She was lucky that she possessed this natural poise that concealed thefundamental romanticism, and made her seem relaxed and efficient.On our first afternoon off – on early closing day – I asked Joy to come to thehome of Stanley Rosenthal, the painter, and I read her the first two acts of TheMetal Flower Blossom. She said she couldn’t imagine the manager of Lewis’sallowing it to be performed there, but the afternoon served the purpose ofplacing me in a direct relation with her, instead of having to use Flax as anintermediary. I couldn’t invite her back to my home: with my sister Susan and mybrothers Barry and Rodney there would be nowhere in the house where I might gether alone, although in recent years my mother had managed to furnish the frontroom, which had always been empty during my childhood. Besides, my parentswanted a reconciliation with Betty; Joy would hardly have been welcome.It was on that afternoon, leaving Stanley Rosenthal’s, that I remember lookingat Joy and thinking: I wonder what it would be like to be married to her? andtrying to envisage a future with her. It was only a casual daydream, and itseemed about as unlikely as anything I could think of.Subsequently, I introduced her to other friends: to my homosexual friend Alan(who disliked her, but not as much as he had disliked Mary), to the poet MauriceWillows, and to John Crabbe, a new acquaintance – a man of my own age, wholooked at least forty, with a small moustache and the mild eyes of Wells’s MrPolly. Crabbe was a music lover; he had a record player and access to completeoperas on LP (which was fairly new at the time, and which struck me asmiraculous). I spent long evenings with him, listening to the complete Bohème,Flying Dutchman and Meistersinger, and the symphonies of Brahms and Beethoven. Itook Joy there one evening to listen to opera, and to read her – and John Crabbe– some of my favourite poems (I was much given to reading poetry aloud in thosedays – with Yeats, Eliot and Rupert Brooke at the top of the list, and WilfredOwen’s ‘Exposure’ a special favourite). Walking home with her, I reached downfor her hand, but she was wearing a coat with turned-up cuffs, like ahighwayman’s, and my hand found its way into this, and I groped bemusedly. Atthis point, she decided to help me, and offered her hand. I had no idea whethershe regarded this as a light flirtation, to be kept strictly within the boundsof decorum, or whether she was really interested in me. But I was beginning tohope.On the next occasion I called for her, her landlady told me she was still in thebath, and asked me if I would wait. She did not invite me to wait inside, so Istood on the doorstep, my coat collar turned up. When Joy came down she said,‘I’m so sorry,’ and gave me her hands completely naturally.Otherwise, she was not particularly encouraging. But I had grown used to Betty’sshyness and detachment, so this didn’t bother me. My own intentions were stillnot definite; my emotions were uncommitted. She was due to go to Canada in a fewmonths to get married, and in all probability she would do so; there was nopoint in building plans around her.But there came an evening when I decided that, if it was possible, I wouldpersuade her out of the marriage. We were crossing Victoria Park in the dark,and I asked her what books she had in Leicester with her – her home at the timewas near Peterborough. She listed Yeats’s poems and plays, Proust (in French),Virginia Woolf, and Ulysses. Most of the attractive girls I had known had beendefinitely unliterary; and the few literary ones had been unattractive. EvenBetty, who was intelligent enough in a practical way, had never really shared myinterest in literature and ideas. Plainly, if I intended to settle with a girl,Joy would be about as close to the ideal as I could find.Flax and I continued to play the dominance game. The steeple of the nearby StMargaret’s Church was being repaired, and there was some scaffolding. One icynight, Flax proposed that we should climb it. In childhood I had been terrifiedof heights, but I was not now willing to acknowledge this. We clambered up theladder, and then up the scaffolding round the steeple. When I made the mistakeof looking down, my stomach seemed to fall into the void below, and I had aterrifying sense that only the grip of my hands prevented me from landing onthose hard paving stones. I decided it was better not to think about it, andcompleted the climb to the top.After an exploit like this, Flax and I were on extremely close terms, thedominance question having sunk temporarily into abeyance.I introduced him to Alan, Maurice Willows, John Crabbe and Stanley Rosenthal. Iwanted to make the point that external dominance can turn into intellectuality.Obviously, he considered them all weaklings. He dismissed Alan as a bitchyqueer. It would have been interesting to see what would have happened if Flaxand Bill Hopkins had come together.Joy was right when she told me that the manager would never pass Metal FlowerBlossom for performance, and he was equally definite about the Twentieth CenturyRevue when he came to the poem about homosexual elephants.It was true that I had now achieved my purpose in getting close to Joy, even tothe extent of being allowed to kiss her goodnight, but I didn’t like to admitdefeat about the show, so I suggested that we do the first act of Man andSuperman. The manager found this unexceptionable, so we put it into rehearsal,with Joy playing Ann. We used to rehearse at the Capital T, the temperance clubin Granby Street. When Joy and I went into the dark backyard for our bicycles, Iwould seize the opportunity to kiss her. She always struggled and protested, butcould not have really objected, or she would have stopped going into the yardwith me.I suppose the turning point in our relation was when Flax persuaded her and Patto spend the weekend at his flat, with me as a fourth. The original idea hadbeen to seduce Pat that weekend, but she had ceded her virtue several eveningsearlier. Flax told me how, as he lay beside her in a state of sexual excitement,she had masturbated him to a climax, then smiled at him triumphantly. But hisvirility had been equal to the challenge and he had another erection within tenminutes.We all worked Saturday, of course. On Saturday evening, we went to Flax’s house,taking beer, wine and food. The two girls prepared a meal; I read them thelatest chapter of Ritual. Afterwards we went to the pub and had more to drink,then came back and talked until the early hours of the morning.Pat and Flax got into bed together; Joy and I lay on two mattresses in front ofthe fire, each with a blanket. We were both fully dressed. After the fire hadburned low enough to make us invisible to the occupants of the bed, I movedunder her blanket and spread mine over us. As we lay there in the firelight, Iwhispered that I thought she was the most marvellous girl I had ever met. I sawfrom her smile that she wanted to believe I meant it.It was a night of virtue; I sensed that she did not want me to try to force herin any way. I didn’t mind; it was a considerable advance to sleep under the sameblanket, even if she pushed my hand away when I tried to put it up her skirt.The four of us spent Sunday together, talking, cooking meals, taking walks anddrinking in the local pubs, and late in the evening we separated. When Flax sawme alone on Monday, he asked me what kind of knickers Joy wore; I said I didn’tknow. He shook his head sadly, and confided that Pat had started wearing winterwoollies, which were a sexual depressant.Man and Superman was finally performed (the first act only) in the canteen a fewdays before Christmas. It was, on the whole, disappointing. I knew Tanner’s partby heart, and even acted it quite well, since I had seen Clements play it atleast a dozen times. But at the last minute the actor who was to play Octaviuslet us down. A poet called Barry Hipwell – a friend of Maurice Willows – agreedto take the part at short notice, but since he could not possibly learn thelines, he had to read them from the book, which spoiled the effect. Joy, beingshy, was as bad an actress as she had said. The audience – mostly consisting ofthe girls who served behind the counters – stared at us in a baffled manner.Luckily, we had two excellent comics in the second part of the show – both fromthe carpet department; one looked and sounded like Arthur Askey, the other didRed Skelton’s routine of Guzzler’s Gin. The audience livened up and beganapplauding all the turns enthusiastically, so that the evening ended in anatmosphere of Christmas cheer.Flax and I had something like a quarrel on Christmas Eve. There was a dance forLewis’s employees, held in the Bell Hotel opposite the shop; I naturally tookJoy. Towards the end of the evening, after calling in at a few pubs, we walkedhome up New Walk, and I decided – against Joy’s advice – to knock on Flax’sdoor. Just as we were about to go away, a light came on and we heard a femalevoice. Then Flax appeared, looking bad-tempered. He said, ‘Oh, it’s you, Wilson.Would you mind going away,’ and slammed the door. I was furious, and evenangrier that something like this had happened in front of Joy. Flax and I wereback on speaking terms after Christmas; but it was impossible to think of him asa friend any more. Bill Hopkins would have been incapable of this kind ofrudeness – as I would myself.Joy went away for Christmas, then to Southampton to see her fiancé off toCanada. When she came back, I thought she seemed subdued; I put this down to afeeling of guilt about me. She had probably rationalised her relationship withme by arguing that she could not be expected to spend six months in Leicesterwithout friends, and that she had not encouraged me. What I did not know wasthat the relationship with her future husband had imperceptibly weakened duringa year she had spent teaching in France, and that the relationship with me hadmade her aware of this. Being a vague sort of girl, she preferred to avoidconflict, but a point would obviously arrive when she had to make up her mind.Now Christmas was over, the manager called me to his office, and pointed outthat I had been taken on in a temporary capacity, and that I had promised to buya suit. What did I intend to do – buy a suit and stay on, or leave? I wasfeeling restless again, and besides, I had been selling rugs to some of myrelatives at cost price, and this was bound to appear in the stocktaking. So Isaid I would leave. I had already decided to return to London.The episode on Christmas Eve might have ended my relation with Flax, but he hadpersuaded Joy and a trainee named June to take his upstairs rooms as a flat.They needed redecorating, and I offered to do it. And so, when I left my work atLewis’s, I delayed taking a job for another week, and spent the time paintingthe walls and ceilings. I knew June well, having worked with her and taken herto the Capital T on a couple of occasions. Although she was engaged to bemarried, our relationship was vaguely flirtatious.Maurice Willows proposed giving a New Year party, and Joy and I were invited. Bythis time, I was pressing her to leave Leicester and come to London with me, butso far she had refused flatly. But John Crabbe, to whom I’d mentioned the idea,showed unexpected insight when he said: ‘Don’t worry. She will.’Joy and I went to the New Year party at Maurice’s on Saturday evening, afterwork. We had bicycles, but Maurice announced that anyone who wanted to couldsleep on the floor. I tried to persuade Joy to stay, but she said no. We had anargument about it in the corridor. She told me later that at this point, Iseized her face between my hands and banged her head several times on the wall.If this is so, I had drunk more than usual; I cannot recollect it. Apparentlythis gentle persuasion made her decide to stay.Again, we slept on the floor, covered with a blanket – again, fully clothed. Butshe made no resistance when I reached up the back of the skirt and put my handon her knickers. I felt it a major step forward. If she made a habit of sleepingwith me, even fully clothed, she could hardly persist in the belief that she wasnot encouraging me.I spent the following day decorating the flat. Joy had gone home for the day,and I met her off the train in the early evening. She came and joined me andcooked me a meal. Afterwards we lay on a bad settee, kissing, but shestrenuously resisted my attempt to unzip her jeans. Finally, mildly exasperated,I said: ‘Don’t you care for me at all?’ She said nothing for a long time and Irepeated the question. Finally, she said, almost inaudibly: ‘Yes.’ I said:‘Good. Then you’d better come to London and break off your engagement.’ Andalthough I had to return home that night, I felt a sense of deep satisfaction.The next day, a Monday, Joy went to work, and I again spent the day decoratingthe flat. In the evening she once again joined me and cooked a meal. It came tothe time for her to go home, and I knew this would be crucial. I had made up amattress for myself on the floor; I asked her to stay too. She said she couldn’t– her landlady would begin to wonder what was happening. I pointed out that shewas leaving shortly anyway. Finally she agreed, and then, to my delight, removedher skirt before getting into bed. (Since she had to go to work in it, she couldhardly sleep in it.) As she climbed between the sheets in her underwear Icouldn’t believe my luck – I said later that I felt like a cat that has beengiven a whole chicken.Sensing her nervousness I made no attempt to force her. In fact, I was delightedjust to lie there kissing her. My marriage had left me with certain sexualinhibitions – for on one occasion when I had ejaculated prematurely Betty hadburst into tears. So in bed with Joy, what Viktor Frankl calls ‘the law ofreverse effort’ operated in my favour. (Frankl was the Viennese psychologist whorealised that when a stutterer is asked to try and stutter, he is suddenlyunable to stutter – obviously because the tension that causes the stutter hasnow disappeared.) Knowing that Joy was nervous removed my own inhibitions.In any case, it was such an intoxicating sensation lying beside Joy that Iwanted nothing more. It seemed incredible that, only six weeks earlier, I hadfelt my heart sink as I looked at her, feeling she was one of the most desirablegirls I had ever seen, and now she was in bed with me without any clothes on. (Ihad soon removed the rest.) It was one of those moments when all life seemswonderful, and I was carried away by sheer delight.This was not primarily sexual, although obviously there was a sexual element init; it was one of those moments when you feel that the gods are on your side,and that life is wholly good. I felt as Van Gogh probably felt as he painted TheStarry Night – total affirmation. It seemed appropriate that her name was Joy;no one had ever given me such joy.She had gone when I woke up next morning – she had to return to her room tochange before going to work. At mid-morning, I cycled down to Lewis’s to joinher for the coffee break, and I noted my feelings with interest. It was arevival of what I had felt during the early months of my marriage to Betty – thesame comfortable sense of not being alone any more. Although I had only kissedJoy, I had a sense of being married to her; what had happened the previous nightwas like an exchange of rings. She also seemed quite different as we drankcoffee together; she knew that something had changed permanently.When I suggested that she ought to write to her fiancé to explain that she hadchanged her mind, she said, ‘Yes, I suppose I ought.’ It was also settled thatshe would come to London. I did not press her too hard; I could see she wasworried and self-divided. But I was certain of one thing: we were in it togethernow.I found a job in a boot-and-shoe factory. It paid well, which was the main thingI was interested in. The work was very hard. I was doing a job called ‘bottompolishing’: a man to my left pushed a trolley full of shoes at me; I had topolish the soles and hand them on to a man on my right; all three were gearedtogether, and we were all on piecework, being paid by quantity. At the end ofthe day, I ached from head to foot. The machines pounded; considerable force hadto be used in holding the shoes against the brushes revolving at a high speed;if my grip relaxed, the shoe flew out of my hand and across the room.I went to see Joy that evening. She was not yet in, but Flax was; he invited mein for a beer. When Joy came, she made food for the two of us. Flax was talkingabout his increasing boredom in his job, the craving for action. The previousSaturday, two teddy boys had got into an argument with him in the shop. He toldthem he would see them on the car park next door at six o’clock, and they werewaiting for him. It was the kind of situation he loved: he left them bothhalf-unconscious, and the memory of it was obviously a source of satisfaction,although his knuckles were skinned. As we talked about the need for action, Flaxsaid: ‘I think I’ll go for a run. Care to come?’It was the old dominance game. I said ‘All right,’ and changed into running kitwhich he provided. ‘To the Stoneygate Terminus and back?’ That was about twomiles along the London Road. He even persuaded Joy to come with us, and she ranalongside with an easy, graceful stride. When we reached the terminus, Flaxsaid: ‘Let’s go on to Great Glen, Ok?’ That was another five miles. I agreed.Joy went back home by bus, promising to make us coffee, and we ran on, up thehill past the racecourse and along the double concrete highway.I remembered from my old running days at school that the important thing was toget the body into a machine-like rhythm, ignore the pain in your side, and waitfor second wind. My second wind came some time before we reached Great Glen. Aswe ran into the village, I saw there was a bus waiting there. But Flax said,‘Round the island and straight back, all right?’ I was too winded to do anythingbut nod.Long before we reached Leicester, I was wondering what would happen if I slowedto a walk for a moment. I could not feel my legs; they had become numb, and sohad my lungs, but my legs were obviously working. I had a floating, detachedfeeling; my body was carrying on without me. Then, at the top of the hill by theracecourse, I saw a bus at the Stoneygate terminal, the last bus of the evening.I pointed to it and shouted: ‘Let’s run and catch it?’ He nodded, and wesprinted downhill as the engine of the bus revved up. It started, and we made alast spurt; I jumped on board ahead of Flax. He waved ironically to me, and wenton running. It was typical of him; the need to go one better at any cost.Years later, Joy and I were in Edinburgh, having dinner with the book-sellerAnthony d’Offay, who was selling some of my manuscripts to Americanuniversities. He had known Flax well in recent years, and mentioned the story ofour run. I told him what had happened. He said, ‘Then you didn’t collapse?’ Isaid no, I hadn’t. ‘That’s odd. Flax said that when you were halfway back toLeicester, you had a blackout and fell down. He said, “Poor old Colin, he wasgame, but his body let him down.” Are you sure you didn’t collapse?’I said I was sure, and Joy verified that I had arrived back twenty minutes or sobefore Flax. I had run a hot bath and climbed into it. Flax came in and joinedme in it. We were both feeling pleased with ourselves, and for the rest of theevening we were on almost the same terms as before Christmas.Flax and Pat had decided to get married; they certainly seemed to suit oneanother as well as Joy and I did. But Flax’s will to power was still getting himinto trouble.On the evening Joy had slept on the mattress upstairs with me for the firsttime, he had been out at the engagement party of an old army friend who wasmarrying a beautiful model named Sybil, who worked at Lewis’s demonstratingperfumes; she had apparently moved her lodgings only that afternoon. The partywent on late, and the future bridegroom was in no condition to escort hisfiancée home. Her new lodgings were somewhere near New Walk, so Flax and sheshared a taxi. But when they got out in the street where she lived, she said shewas unable to recognise the place in the dark, and she had left the address inher room. They walked up and down for half an hour, then Flax said she hadbetter come and sleep at his place. Arriving back at three in the morning, hechuckled to see Joy’s bicycle and mine still outside the door. Inevitably, heand Sybil shared the same bed, and she left early the next morning.However, she left some hair pins in the bed, and Pat found them. There were alsoa few platinum blonde hairs on the pillow. Flax pleaded with her, but Pat saidthis was the end. In fact, she showed unusual strength of character in refusingto see him again. Her previous boyfriend had treated her badly, and no doubt shewas determined not to repeat the disaster. Flax reconciled himself to Pat’sdefection by persuading Sybil to break off her engagement, and they were stilltogether when I saw him some six months later in London.My meeting with Joy represented a turning point for me. With her, I had afeeling that a permanent element in my life had fallen into place. Since I leftschool, my life had been an awkward, out-of-joint thing. My destiny was imposedon me by circumstances; the only part of it that really seemed to belong to mewas my writing. The rest was often an irrelevant bore. Nothing ever went rightfor long. I was a clumsy person, always fated to knock things over. Yet I wasbasically optimistic, for I believed Pound when he wrote: > What thou lov’st well remains, the rest is dross> What thou lov’st well shall not be reft from thee> What thou lov’st well is thy true heritage …I also knew Auden’s lines: > Beloved, we are always in the wrong,> Handling so clumsily our stupid lives,> Suffering too little or too long,> Too careful even in our selfish loves.I had pursued science, then become a writer because I wanted to escape thissense of always being in the wrong, of clumsiness and stupidity; to impose orderon a small area of my existence. Our vision of what we would like to be, and theactuality of our lives, always seem to be in conflict, until most of us end byaccepting the compromise. Those who insist on clinging to their self-image inspite of reality often end in madhouses insisting they are Julius Caesar.In my moments of depression, I often found myself wondering what happens ifreality keeps on repelling your assaults on it, your attempts to impose your ownterms? When did it first strike Keats’s friend Benjamin Robert Haydon that hewas not the world-shattering genius he always believed, that he was simply apainter of inflated and grandiose pictures? Or did it ever strike him? Humanbeings have many means of escaping the truth; I had been observing my fellow menfor years, and meant one day to write a book called The Methods and Techniquesof Human Self-Deception.But here, with Joy, was at least one human relationship that seemed to conformwith my inner world, with what I ‘loved well’. She was like a sexual daydreamcome true. She accepted me at precisely my own valuation, as a child acceptsparents. After two years with Betty I was touchy and tense, on the lookout forany hints of patronising superiority. With Joy, they never came.I must admit that her sexual shyness also came as a relief. The Kay episode inLondon had forced me to recognise that my marriage had implanted an element ofsexual self-doubt. ‘Le fiasco’ (as Stendhal called it) is a nervous ailment,like a stutter, and the more one worries about stuttering, the worse it islikely to become.The limit of Joy’s sexual experience so far had been a little petting. Shedidn’t want to be hurried, and neither did I. We slept together as often aspossible, but I was free of that sense that I had experienced in bed with Kay –that I was expected to demonstrate my masculinity. What made abstinence easierwas that she was the most kissable and cuddly girl I had ever known; althoughslim, she was as soft and warm as a baby. I sometimes felt guilty atmonopolising her.After a few weeks of the shoe factory, I had had enough of Leicester. I had nospecial motive in moving to London; no nostalgia for Soho or the cast of TheMetal Flower Blossom. But while life remained fundamentally unsatisfying, I hadto keep moving."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7> LONDON AND THE OUTSIDERThe next year in London was the worst so far. In spite of having found Joy, somedemon with an ironic sense of humour was still driving me from pillar to post. Isuspect it was trying to make a writer of me.I found myself a room in Archway, in a house run by a Scotsman. I had hoped thata landlord might be preferable to a landlady, but I was soon disillusioned; hewas as fussy and trivial-minded as any old woman.I went to the Labour Exchange in North Finchley, and was directed to a job in alaundry. It was heavy work that involved loading wet laundry into spin dryers,and unloading it fifteen minutes later. I handled tons of wet linen a day.Joy wrote to me often, but I now began to realise that one of the disadvantagesof her sunny and easy-going personality was an extraordinary vagueness: shewould forget to write for a week and I became convinced that something was wrongor that she had changed her mind about living in London. She finally came amonth later, took a room in Fellowes Road, Chalk Farm, and found a job at PeterRobinson, a big store at Oxford Circus.I found something frustrating in my relationship with her, something I could notdefine. I knew that she was not sure of me – Flax had warned her that I wouldleave her within six months – but this didn’t explain it. I know now that theproblem was that I had been used to Betty and, before that, to Mary; both ofthem rather insecure, craving affection, driven by strong emotions. Bycomparisson Joy seemed oddly understanding and this was because her early lifehad been so secure and conventional.Like any middle-class young lady, she had learned to ride a horse, joined thelocal tennis club, and worn an evening gown to attend dances with young men indinner jackets. Whenever she talked about her relatives, they sounded to me likecharacters out of The Forsyte Saga. Her life had flowed on like a quiet stream:a private school for young ladies (where the novelist Beryl Bainbridge was afellow pupil), university in Dublin, and weekends fishing on the west coast ofIreland.She had spent a year as a teacher in France and, when I met her, was filling intime as a trainee manager, with every intention of getting married and settlingdown to a routine middle-class existence in Canada. I had disrupted thisexistence, made her take an irrevocable decision – she had written to break offher engagement. And I was touchy, impatient, arrogant and demonstrative, andinclined to bully her when she arrived an hour late or had me sitting by thetelephone waiting for a call that, in her sweet vagueness, she had forgotten tomake.One rainy day in March I had just got out of the bath when my landlord told methere was someone to see me. An elderly gentleman announced that he was Joy’sfather (‘My name is Stewart, sir’) and that he would like to speak to me. Iinvited him in; he said he would prefer that I came out to the car.It was an unfortunate interview. Joy’s parents had been shocked when she toldthem she had broken off her engagement – her future had seemed comfortablysettled. They had looked through a suitcase she had left at home, and found someof my letters, ‘devilishly clever letters’, said her father sternly. As far asthey could see, Joy had been lured astray by a plausible young rogue, a bohemianwaster who no doubt only wanted to seduce her, or perhaps send her to work andlive off her earnings.What her father had to suggest was that I should change my address and never seeJoy again (his actual words were: ‘Get out of town, Wilson’); otherwise, theywould take her back to Peterborough. I pointed out that that depended entirelyon Joy: if she asked me to go away and never see her again, I would, but since Ihad persuaded her to come to London, I could hardly walk out on her simplybecause her parents disapproved of me. Anyway, what right had he to disapproveof me since he didn’t know me? He said that my letters told him all that heneeded to know – that I would obviously ‘end in the gutter’.To me it seemed an unreal situation. I could not take it seriously. I had toldher father that I was in love with Joy because it seemed to be expected of me,but it was not wholly true. I was somehow not the sort of romantic to ‘fall inlove’; that was the kind of thing that happened to teenagers. She attracted meimmensely, yet she seemed detached and undemonstrative. Surely all that hadhappened was that two people who strongly attracted one another had embarked onan affair, which might or might not last?I had been in the car about half an hour, getting colder and colder. I wascertain that I was developing a cold (and proved correct). I ended by tellingher father that we were obviously never going to see eye to eye, and wentindoors again.I rang Joy and told her what had happened. In due course, her father arrived ather lodgings and placed the alternatives before her: to stop seeing me, or betaken home. After a long discussion, she was allowed to remain in London oncondition that she promised never to visit me at my lodgings. When I went overto see her later on, I was furious: she was over twenty-one; what right had herparents to offer her ultimatums? I found it hard to understand that she didn’tfeel hostile toward them. She could see, of course, that they were simplyworried; for all they knew, I might be a white slaver. And Joy was such a gentlegirl she could probably be bullied into anything.To add to my problems, I was having trouble with my landlord. My gas fire wasworking badly, and I dismantled it, saw that it was blocked, and asked mylandlord to get it repaired. When the workman came, he told the landlord that adismantled gas fire could be dangerous. My landlord promptly gave me notice.Again I had a feeling that it was some malign destiny that kept devising thesestupid situations. It was midweek and I demanded a full week’s notice – which hewas obliged to give me by law. But I was so angry that I went out looking forrooms the next day, and found the whole upper floor of a house in Summers Lane,North Finchley, for thirty shillings a week. I moved my books there, and onSaturday morning told the landlord that I was moving out.He was indignant. He said he had turned away an inquiry for a room only thatmorning, and that if I wanted to leave I would have to pay the week’s rent, orhe would refuse to let me take my baggage. I went to the local police stationand asked their advice; they told me that the landlord would have to sue me ifhe thought he had a case. I returned to my room; the landlord was out, so I lefthim a note telling him where he could find me if he wanted to sue me, and left.I never heard from him.I worked in the laundry for about a month, but I found it boring as well asexhausting; moreover, they were underpaying me for the work I was doing. Idecided to change my job and, in spite of my resolution never again to work inan office, I applied at the local exchange for an office job. They directed meto a garage near Finchley Central station. I was taken on as a storeroom clerk,and my role was to keep a check on thousands of spare parts, and to issue themto garage repairmen. Since I have never looked under the bonnet of a car, thevarious names were Greek to me, and they bored me so much that I had no desireto learn them. After two weeks, the foreman sacked me.I then found a job with the Victoria Wine Company that consisted in enteringorders in a ledger. I knew almost as little about wine as about cars, so foundthis equally boring.The Scottish clerk with whom I worked had a pink, girlish face, a slightstutter, and incredible belligerence. He was strongly anti-Semitic, referring toHampstead as Abrahampstead, and Golders Green as Goldstein’s Green. And heseemed to regard it as a kind of insult that a ‘bohemian’ should occupy the seatnext to him (the word ‘beatnik’ had not then been invented), and he played thedominance game for all he was worth. I didn’t regard him as worth wrangling withanyway, and my indifference infuriated him. (In 1960, I was to meet him bychance in Stockholm, and his first words to me were: ‘You know, I’m far more ofa genius than you are’ – he had been irritated by some Swedish journalist’sfulsome description of me.) After a few weeks, the Victoria Wine Company sackedme too.It was at about this time that I received a letter from Betty saying that sheintended suing me for maintenance. This seemed to me one more attempt to tie medown to a respectable job and turn me into a ‘husband and father’. My firstimpulse was to go back to France, or at least move far away to some obscuretown. But she finally agreed to drop the idea when I offered to pay her a weeklyallowance – which, under the circumstances, I could obviously not afford.There were also minor irritations about my lodgings. The old lady who rented thehouse lived off National Assistance; she had a daughter in her mid-thirties – alarge, owl-like girl – and a fat grand-daughter. The daughter soon made me herconfidant, explaining that her husband had left her and that she supplementedthe National Assistance with a little streetwalking. I did not in the leastobject to the streetwalking, but I found it tiresome to discover in my bedroomunmistakable signs that it had been used to receive her male friends. The girlherself seemed to have a curious preference for eating fish-paste sandwiches inbed, and I often had to remake the bed to remove the stale crumbs.I had had a quarrel with Joy about her refusal to visit my lodgings; I was soangry I determined never to see her again. But we had already started to getused to each other – the real basis of all marriages – and after two days, Iwent to see her in the Oxford Street shop.I pointed out that I had now changed my lodgings, so her promise to her parentsdid not apply to this flat. And since she was also missing me, she allowedherself to be convinced by this piece of casuistry, and agreed to come thatevening.My room contained no settee on which we might sit together – only a chair and abed. Joy had been too well brought up to accept an invitation to lie on a bed inthe early evening, so we sat on the floor, to my immense frustration. Finally, Ihad an idea; I tossed a coin and said: ‘Heads we lie on the bed, tails we staywhere we are.’ To my relief it came down heads, and Joy kept her part of thebargain.We were still not lovers. This may sound strange, but her shyness made it seemnatural. Besides, I found it so pleasant just being in the same bed that I wasperfectly contented, realising that one of the main problems with sex is that itso easily becomes a habit, and wanting to make the anticipation last as long aspossible. I recognised that the pleasure of lovemaking lies to a large extent inthe imagination, and the sight of Joy in her underwear often struck me as sobeautiful that I forgot to feel sexual desire.Joy’s parents were hoping we had split up, for she had told them so during thatweekend when we were quarrelling about her refusal to return to my room. Whenthey learned we were still together they summoned me to come and see them attheir home at Orton Longueville. And since it was obvious that Joy would get nopeace until I agreed, the two of us set out one hot Saturday afternoon tohitch-hike there.The journey would result in one of the most important insights of my life. Whathappened was this.We took the bus as far as Barnet. But beyond that there was little traffic onthe road, and we tramped on in the heat. I didn’t care much whether we got alift or not, for I was not looking forward to being grilled by her parents. Butthen, I was also bored with London. So I had no strong motivation to go forwardor back.Finally, a lorry stopped for us. The cab was hot. And after about half an hour,there was a knocking noise from the gearbox. The driver explained that he wouldhave to let us off at the next garage, so in due course we clambered out andresumed waving our thumbs at passing traffic.After a walk of several miles, another lorry stopped. I was feeling sodisgruntled by now that I felt no particular relief, merely a feeling of ‘Abouttime too …’And then – the preposterous coincidence: there was a knocking noise from hisgearbox, and for the second time in an hour, the driver told us he would have todrop us at the next garage. I found myself thinking indignantly: Oh no, notagain! And realised that this was the first positive thing I had felt sinceleaving London.The driver discovered that if he slowed down to about twenty-five miles an hour,the knocking stopped. So he kept his speed low, and we ground on through thehot, dull afternoon. But by this time, Joy and I were listening intently for aresumption of the noise, for we were now as anxious to get there as the driverwas. And when he said: ‘I think if we stay at this speed we’re going to makeit,’ I felt a surge of relief.Then I was struck by the absurdity of the situation. There we were, in theoverheated cab of a lorry driving at twenty-five miles an hour, and actuallyfeeling grateful to be there.I thought: it is as if there is an area of the mind which is indifferent topositive stimulus (i.e. the lorry stopping for us) but which can be stirred intoactivity by a negative stimulus (the threat of the lorry breaking down).We happened to be passing through a small town called St Neots, whose name Imisread as St Neot. Knowing how easily such flashes of insight are lost, Iscrawled in my pocket notebook ‘St Neot Margin’. And, weeks later, I found itand wondered that the hell I meant. Then the name ‘St Neot’ brought it back.Later, I came to call it ‘the indifference threshold’. In psychology, athreshold means a level at which some stimulus becomes noticeable. We have anoise threshold, a pain threshold, and so on. The ‘indifference threshold’ isthe level at which we feel that a certain effort is worth making. Bored, spoiledpeople develop a high indifference threshold.When Joy and I finally arrived in Orton Longueville, her mother and father madeus sit down on the settee, and asked us the kind of questions that might wellhave been regarded as impertinent: for example, whether Joy was still a virgin.To that we could reply affirmatively, although we went on to admit that we slepttogether. And when Joy admitted that she had also slept with her ex-fiancé, MrsStewart’s expression indicated that she wondered what the younger generation wascoming to. Finally she said firmly: ‘All right, you’ll have to get engaged.’ Andwhen we both said we would, I fancy that Joy’s mother looked relieved. Thesituation was once again normal, and life could go on as before.In fact, I was sleeping with another girl at this time, although, oddly enough,it was completely innocent. Jackie Noble, the girlfriend of Philip Veen (who hadcome to Paris with Bill), had been turned out of her lodgings and had no money.I told her that there was a spare bed at my place, provided she crept inquietly, and left early. Then the old lady moved her grand-daughter into thespare bedroom. Jackie used to arrive at one in the morning, after an eveningdrinking tea in Soho cafes, and climb into bed with me; she usually left thenext morning before I was awake.Bill Hopkins asked her whether I never tried to make love to her. She said thatone night I began to caress her, then rolled over on to her; then I woke up,recognised Jackie, and rolled off again … This is probably true. Jackie was anattractive girl, but she was a true bohemian, and simply not my type. Mytemperament was definitely non-bohemian.One evening, as Joy and I were sitting in bed together drinking tea, thelandlady’s fat grand-daughter walked in without knocking. We usually locked thedoor, but Joy had forgotten. The next morning, as Joy was sneaking out of thehouse, my landlady emerged from the kitchen and told me I would have to leave –this kind of thing might corrupt the child … Since I had been carefullypreserving the secret of her daughter’s spare-time occupation, this struck me asan absurd piece of irony. If my mild half-deaf and half-blind landlady couldgive me notice, my ironic demon must have some powerful grudge against me.By that time I had found another job at a plastics factory in Whetstone, and Ifound this less boring than the offices. But after a few weeks of it, Iquarrelled with the foreman. I had gone into work one Saturday morning(Saturdays were overtime, and we could refuse to do it if we wanted to). Afterclocking in, I went to a shop next door to buy some chocolate (I was a voraciouseater of chocolate and sweets in those days). When I got back, a few minuteslater, the foreman caught me going in, and ordered me to clock in again. A fewyears before I would have done what he said, and cursed under my breath, butendless irritations and frustrations had ground my patience to a fine point. Itold him to go to Hell, and went home. On Monday, he told me I could collect mycards at the end of the week. This was when my landlady gave me notice.I was beginning to feel like Raskolnikov just before the murder in Crime andPunishment, when he suddenly has the feeling ‘he would not go on living likethat’. I was sick of putting up with fools, working at jobs I hated, neverhaving the leisure to work continuously at Ritual in the Dark. I had beenwrestling with it now for six years, since I was seventeen, and it really neededa month’s hard and unbroken work to turn it into a novel instead of a series offragments. There were whole chapters in it that seemed to me good, but it wouldnot be a novel until I could start at the beginning and write on to the end.I read Graham Greene’s entertainments – with considerable impatience – and itseemed clear to me that I could do as well as that. Why not, since Balzac hadlaunched his career by writing potboilers under assumed names? What was I doingin these pointless jobs? It was time I started being a writer.And in this mood of total frustration, it suddenly struck me that part of myproblem was that I had to pay rent. It was low enough by ordinary standards, butrent and fuel and National Insurance and income tax meant that I was earningabout three times as much as I needed to feed myself. At this time, JohnnyAbraham, the friend in whose room we had rehearsed the Twentieth Century Revue,was proposing to go off to the Middle East and wander around for a year, seeingthe world; he had bought a tent and waterproof sleeping bag. It came to me thatthis might be the answer. Once you had paid for a tent, it was yours. And youcould put up a tent anywhere in a field. I was living near the outskirts ofLondon – half an hour’s cycle ride from the open country north of Barnet.I put the plan into operation at once. I bought a cheap tent and a sleeping bag.Barry Hipwell, the Leicester poet who had played in Man and Superman at Lewis’svisited me that weekend. He told me he had decided to move to London, and askedmy help in finding lodgings. I told him he could have my room. I took my booksto Joy’s lodgings in Chalk Farm. And before the end of my last week at theplastics factory, I was sleeping outdoors in my tent. For the first few nights,I stayed in a field on the edge of a golf course near the factory. But I soondecided that the tent was superfluous; it was too much trouble to put up andtake down, and attracted too much attention. It was enough to have thewaterproof sleeping bag. If it rained, I could pull the top over my head, thensleep securely while the rain pattered on the impenetrable rubber.All this meant, of course, that I could not continue to send Betty money. But bythis time, she had found another nurse–housekeeper post at Billesdon, nearLeicester, so this was not too serious.I had about twenty pounds to come when I left the plastics factory. This oughtto last me a month if I spent it only on food (and resisted the temptation tobuy books). I started sleeping on Hampstead Heath, which was conveniently closeto Joy’s lodgings, and within easy distance of the British Museum. I knew of abusman’s café opposite the Chalk Farm underground station where I could get acup of tea and two thick slices of bread and dripping for sevenpence. I wentthere every morning for breakfast. Then I would cycle to the museum, and leavemy rucksack in the cloakroom. (The attendant obviously regarded this as animposition, and threatened to complain to the museum authorities, but nothingcame of it.) At once I began to work hard on rewriting Ritual in the Dark.This new routine was infinitely preferable to working every day in an office orfactory, but it was by no means ideal. I was mentally exhausted by the wear andtear of the past two years; leading the life of a tramp in London did nothing toease the strain. When I told Bill Hopkins that I was sleeping on the heath andwriting in the museum during the day, he said enthusiastically, ‘That’s theidea, Col, build up the Wilson legend!’ But I could not live on legends.Through the Reading Room I met one of the most interesting characters so far. Iwas reading Bretall’s Kierkegaard Anthology, which has Kierkegaard’s namesplayed down the back in gold letters. As I was sitting outside the museumeating a sandwich, a young man approached me and said: ‘I see you’re readingKierkegaard. I’m studying Heidegger,’ and we fell into conversation. He was aCanadian named Alan Detweiler, and he was also studying music – particularly theSwedish composer Berwald. As we talked, I mentioned that I sometimes spoke onHyde Park Corner. Alan immediately suggested that I should go to meet a friendof his. And a few days later, I took the tube to Warwick Avenue, and wasintroduced to a middle-aged man with a faint European accent and a kindly smile.His name was Alfred Reynolds, and he lived in a room lined with books andgramophone records. Alfred was a Hungarian Jew, and in the 1930s had been forcedto flee from Europe by the Nazis. He had changed his name from Rheinhart toReynolds, and become an intelligence officer in the British army.At the end of the war, Alfred had been assigned the difficult task ofde-Nazifying young Nazis. The first time he entered the classroom, he felt awall of sheer hostility as they waited for him to start telling them that Hitlerwas a monster and Nazism was wicked. Instead, he sat down on a desk, and beganasking them why they had joined the Hitler youth. He listened to their storiessympathetically, and interjected the occasional question, using the same methodas Socrates to make them aware of their own contradictions. Soon he had won themall over; there was not a Nazi left among them. And they had transferred alltheir loyalty and affection to Alfred, and his faith of tolerance andunderstanding.He became the leader of a movement called ‘Die Brücke’, The Bridge – or simplyBridge. It swept all over post-war Europe, with thousands of members. But withthe German economic recovery, the young idealists turned their attention tomoney-making, and the movement shrank until it was now limited to a group whomet in Alfred’s rooms in London.Alfred now asked me if I would demonstrate my speaking abilities. So we took abus down to Hyde Park Corner, and I found myself a folding chair and proceededto speak. Soon I had a large audience, to whom I preached the gospel ofAnarchism.After half an hour of lecturing and taking questions, I closed the discussionand went back to Alfred. He was much impressed, and proposed that I shouldbecome co-leader of Bridge in England. Then we went back to Warwick Avenue,where he provided me with an excellent supper – he was a superb cook – andtalked about Thomas Mann and Hermann Hesse.But before I went to work as his recruiting sergeant – after all, the principlesof Anarchism were very close to those of Bridge – he suggested that I shouldattend a few meetings. About two dozen young men and one very pretty young womangathered in his room, and Alfred would start the evening by playing some music.It was here I made the acquaintance of the superb Brahms first piano concerto,Bruckner’s ‘Romantic’ Symphony and the Mahler Ninth. Then we had a break forcoffee and biscuits. Then Alfred talked for half an hour about reason andtolerance, and invited discussion.It was at this point that I began to experience acute doubt. I was entirely infavour of reason and tolerance. But did Alfred understand the kind of feelingsthat drove people like Irmgard Huckman and Flax Halliday to look for meaning andadventure in a civilisation that offered no sense of purpose? He was violentlyanti-religion, and referred to priests as ‘black crows’. But did he understandthe torments that drove a George Fox or John Bunyan? To dismiss them asreligious cranks suggested a lack of the intelligence and insight I had come toexpect of Alfred. They revealed him as a fanatic in his own right, as well as ashallow rationalist.I raised these points, and the meeting turned into an argument between myselfand Alfred. And the same thing happened at the next Bridge meeting I attended,and the next. Finally, Alfred asked me to stop coming, although I would remainwelcome as a dinner guest.It was through Alfred I discovered the music of Berwald, learned to love Brahms,and got to know Beethoven’s Hammerklavier and first Rasoumovsky Quartet.But even at the beginning of our aquaintance, it was clear that an immense gulflay between us. I had talked to him about Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, and he agreedto read them. I recommended Ouspensky’s In Search Of the Miraculous as a goodintroduction, with Kenneth Walker’s Venture With Ideas as a second choice.The next time I saw Alfred, he told me he had now read Gurdjieff and decided hewas a charlatan. I asked him what he had read. He said All and Everything.Appalled, I told him that was the worst possible place to start, that Gurdjieffhad deliberately written the book as a kind of obstacle course to deter theintellectually lazy. Alfred said grandly that he believed in going straight tothe source and ignoring the disciples, and that All and Everything was quiteplainly rubbish. It was then I recognised that Alfred and I would not, afterall, become soul mates.The beautiful girl I have mentioned was the wife of a good-looking young mannamed Stuart Holroyd and, as will be seen, he would play an important part instimulating me to write The Outsider.I introduced Joy to the group, and Alfred was impressed to learn she had adegree – not many women had in those days. And at a later date, Joy even tookFlax Halliday to a Bridge meeting when I was working one evening. Flax causedindignation by arguing in favour of war and militarism. By all normal standards I had become a bum and a drifter; I had done no regularwork for a year, and was living outdoors to avoid paying my wife maintenance.And yet I still had the totally subjective temperament of my childhood; I wantedto be left alone with a pile of books in a room of my own. I hated this businessof living outdoors, of never being able to sleep deeply and soundly because sometramp might stagger over me in the dark, or a policeman order me to move on. (Apoliceman had told me that it is illegal in England to sleep without a roof overyour head.)In the mornings I would wake up to find the sun shining on the damp grass, thesky bright blue, the heath empty. It ought to have been poetic, but I had nocapacity for enthusiasm. I saw it all through a grey mist of exhaustion.In the Reading Room, I had taken note of the Superintendent, the novelist AngusWilson. In fact, it was impossible not to notice him. He had greying hair thatflowed back from his forehead, a purple bow tie, a distinctive nose and a highvoice that carried all over the Reading Room when he was on the phone. He wasoften heard saying things like: ‘Can I speak to John Gielgud? … Oh, hello, John,this is Angus …’His novel Hemlock and After had appeared in 1952, when I was living with Bettyin North Finchley. The Times Literary Supplement had said that it was one of thewittiest novels since Oscar Wilde, and I had hastened to order it from thelibrary. I was disappointed to find that it was not in the least like OscarWilde; the rather bitter satire reminded me of Aldous Huxley’s PointCounterpoint. But he was the first published writer I had seen in the flesh, andI stared at him with fascination.One day I spent half an hour trying to find, without success, an article that T.S. Eliot had written about Ulysses. I went and asked for guidance at the centraldesk, and found myself speaking to Wilson. He came back several hours later withthe volume, having spent the morning searching through the catalogues for it. Wegot into conversation, and I told him I was writing a novel. He said that hewould like to see it when it was finished, and that if he liked it he would showit to his publisher. I took this very seriously (although, having myself saidthe same thing to many young authors, I now realise that it may not have beentoo seriously intended). After that I saw him occasionally, but we neverexchanged more than a few words.I took the opportunity of days in the Reading Room to learn aboutexistentialism. I had discovered Robert Bretall’s Kierkegaard Anthology in theHolborn Public Library, but knew very little of Sartre or Camus. So I read, inquick succession, Helmut Kuhn’s Encounter With Nothingness, Guido Ruggiero’sExistentialism (an attack on it), Blackham’s Six Existentialist Thinkers, IrisMurdoch’s little book on Sartre, Heidegger’s Existence and Being, and Sartre’sNausea and The Age of Reason. And I subsequently wrote an article onexistentialism for a magazine called the Intimate Review, lauched by a Sohofriend, John Rety.I quickly realised that I had always been an existentialist without knowing it.Sartre and Heidegger were exploring the same kind of questions as Dostoevsky andEliot – or even Graham Greene: whether human existence is as brutal andmeaningless as it looks.But Sartre and Heidegger concluded that the answer was yes. And I had a deep andinstinctive conviction that they were wrong. Graham Greene has described how heplayed Russian roulette with a loaded revolver, and how, when he missed death bymerely one chamber, he had experienced an overwhelming sense of joy, a feelingthat life is infinitely beautiful and exciting. I had felt the same after mysuicide bid at sixteen. Even Sartre had commented that he had never felt so freeas when he was in the Resistance, and knew he might be arrested and shot at anymoment.Surely that proved that what is wrong with human existence is simply thatordinary consciousness is too feeble? The real question is how we can raise itspressure. Even sleeping out on Hampstead Heath was making me aware that thiscould be done, for the possible danger of being shaken awake by a policeman, oreven attacked by some drunken vagrant, kept me at a high level of alertness, andthe result was a sense of being more alive. Meanwhile, I seemed to have brought Joy some of my own awful luck withlandladies. She was sharing a room with a French girl, so I could not spend muchtime there, but the landlady allowed them to use a basement room to receivevisitors. One night, the rain came down in torrents, so I slept on the settee inthis visitors’ room, promising to leave very early, before the landlady wasabout. For some odd reason, the French girl came down in the middle of thenight, received a shock at the sight of a strange man asleep, and complained tothe landlady. Joy was more furious with the French girl than the landlady, anddecided to move.She found a room at the other end of Fellowes Road – which was, in any case,more convenient for the Swiss Cottage underground. (She was now working as alibrarian at Stanmore.) I used to cycle down from the Heath in the morning, havecoffee in her room, then cycle to the museum. After a few mornings of this, herlandlady exploded and gave her notice. The woman was an unpleasant neurotic whoscreamed at her children all day; Joy moved out to a room in Stanmore with somerelief. My opinion of landladies was confirmed.August was approaching, and I wanted to get out of London for a few weeks. Thismeant finding another job. I had been borrowing money from a grant that Joy hadbeen given to study as a librarian, but she would have to be repaid shortly. Iwas told that there were many well-paid temporary jobs in dairies; I madeinquiries and was directed to one out on the Great West Road, near OsterleyPark. The pay was good, although the work was monotonous and hard, consisting oflifting crates of milk on to a moving belt.The day started at seven in the morning, and I worked until seven in the eveningto make as much money as possible. I found a field only a few minutes away fromthe dairy, and slept there. On the corner next to the dairy there was aworkman’s café called The Better ’Ole. (It has now been pulled down to make wayfor a garage.) I spent most of my evenings there, since it was too far to gointo town for a few hours. Joy came out and joined me at weekends, sharing thesleeping bag. I had started to learn Greek, to make the job less boring. I wouldlearn a vocabulary in the coffee break, then go over the words in my head as Iworked; if I forgot one of them, the book was open on a nearby crate for a quickglance. I also met a strange woman called Grace, who worked in the canteen andwas a student of astrology and occultism. My scientific training had made me asceptic about such things, but I had to admit that Grace seemed to know thingsabout me that only my mother could know.It was while I was working in the dairy that I came across Camus’s novel TheOutsider in the Chiswick Public Library. The title instantly caught myattention, for I thought I was the only person who used the word in this sense.The book was short; I read it in an evening, and added it to the list of booksabout ‘outsiders’ that I had been accumulating since 1950 in Leicester.After a few weeks at the dairy, I had enough money to repay Joy and we went offfor a week in Cornwall. It was our first holiday together; curiously enough, wehad camped in a field that is less than half a mile from the house where we arenow living. Cornwall delighted me; we bought Norway’s Highways and Byways inDevon and Cornwall, and read aloud to each other legends of giants and trollsand pixies, or stories of Drake and the Spanish Armada.By that time the inevitable had come about and we had become lovers. As soon asthat happened, I sent her off to the birth control clinic, for I had no desireto repeat what had happened with Betty. To my surprise she went without protest– for she seemed so demure and passive about sex that I expected a certainhanging-back. She told me much later that it had not been a pleasant experience,for she had to wear her engagement ring and claim she would be marrying in a fewdays’ time. In the prudish 50s, it was felt that to provide contraceptionwithout immediate prospect of marriage would have been to encourage immorality.But in spite of the demureness, she was deeply satisfying as a lover andpartner. She had a natural shy sensuality that made my head spin when I kissedher. The shyness was important, for it made it immensely piquant to watch hertaking off her clothes. It made her seem like a nun doing a strip-tease.When I first knew her, she wore rather gauzy blue panties, but somehow thesefailed to excite me, being too insubstantial, even if they did make her looklike the heroine of the Jane comic strip in the Daily Mirror, who lost her skirtat least once a week. But I think it must have been some telepathic sympathy – Icertainly never dropped the least hint – that led her to start buying the kindof panties whose smoothness was deeply satisfying to the erect penis rubbingagainst them. And when she occasionally climbed into bed in her panties and bra,with a suspender belt holding up her stockings, I felt – as Apuleius says in TheGolden Ass – as if the apple bough of love had bent over me so I could helpmyself.Years later, when I became a friend of Abraham Maslow, I realised that Joy and Iare what he calls ‘good choosers’. In a paper on dominance, he mentions aninteresting experiment with pigs. Some of the babies in a new litter were shyand nervous, and preferred to stay near the mother. Others were energetic andfull of curiosity, and liked to wander. When the most dominant of these wasexploring outside the pen, the experimenter closed the door so it could not getback, and it became frantic. Yet at the next opportunity, it was doing it again.Curiosity was greater than fear.So the experimenter decided to try offering the pigs two types of food. Onesmelled good but was not particularly nutritious; the other was highlynutritious but smelled awful. The dominant pigs chose the nutritious one andbecame more dominant than ever. The non-dominant pigs chose the other food, andbecame even less dominant. The dominant ones obviously had an instinct aboutwhat was good for them. And from the beginning, Joy and I had a powerfulinstinct that we were good for one another.It struck me then, as it had with Mary and Betty, that the basic sexual stimulusis visual. As you become accustomed to lovemaking, the ‘robot’ edges over the‘real you’, and you find yourself dependent on imagination. A man in the grip ofintense sexual excitement is simultaneously lying on top of the girl, andfloating several feet above her, looking down on her. Joy’s kisses were sosweet, and her body so sensual, that I sometimes joked that she was acombination of every famous concubine in history.But on that Cornish holiday, something seemed to have gone wrong with thesystem, and this brought me a moment of insight that has stayed with me eversince. For a few days, we were afraid that Joy was pregnant and I experiencedagain the old, hunted feeling that I had known four years earlier. The firstthree days of the holiday dragged, and both of us were thinking of the samething all the time. I had always been oddly happy about Joy; somehow, I had afeeling that she was a kind of lucky mascot, and that now I knew her, thingswere bound to go right. Now I wondered if this was another piece ofself-deception. If she was pregnant we had to get back to London immediately,and she had better start thinking about hot baths and jumping off tables.In Teignmouth, she vanished into a ladies’ toilet for half an hour. When shecame out, we wandered along the sands in the direction of the river bridge. Isaid: ‘Well, I suppose we ought to think of returning to London tomorrow.’‘London?’ She looked puzzled for a moment. ‘Oh, there’s no need for that. Itcame on an hour ago.’ It was typical of Joy; she had forgotten to mention it. Iwas staring out over the sea toward Exmouth as she said this, and suddenly thesea was transformed and appeared incredibly beautiful.I found myself thinking: ah, that’s just because you’re relieved. Then I lookedat the sea again and thought: no it’s not. It really is beautiful.What struck me so clearly was that what I was seeing – this immense depth ofmystery, beauty, magic that seemed to be exhaled from the sea and Exmouthpeninsula beyond it – was quite objective. It was really there, all the time.‘Meaning is an objective datum’, as if Nature is actually telling you something.The mechanism of tension and relief had merely pulled aside the veil as thecurtains of a theatre part to reveal the opening scene.But if that was so, then man should be able to induce mystical ecstasy by simplylearning to see things as they are. How? By somehow learning to reproduce themental process that had just removed the blinkers from my own eyes.My basic insight here was not a new one: it is Blake’s recognition that thingswould be seen as ‘infinite’ if the doors of perception were cleansed. But atthis point, my scientific training took over. What precisely was the nature ofthe mental act that would clear the doors of perception?Human beings possess certain curious powers that distinguish them from animals:not only their ability to be raised into a trancelike state of delight by poetryor music, but also the capacity to induce sexual excitement – and even an orgasm– without the actual presence of the sexual object. No animal can masturbatewithout the presence of some stimulus; only man has this power to build up acomplex set of responses in the mind by imagination alone.In the same way, there is no reason why man should not learn to brush asidethese veils of indifference and habit that separate him from reality. It issimply a question of reproducing the mental act.Why do I feel so happy when a tune or a smell vividly reminds me of some eventin my past? Because I become aware of the richness, the multiplicity of life,and I burst out of this narrow room of subjectivity. When I am trapped in thatroom, nothing seems worth doing; trivial inconveniences throw me into despair.And then some tiny event – like Proust’s madeleine dipped in tea – reminds me of‘otherness’, and it is like an immense laughter that brushes aside all my ownvalues and feelings and places me in contact with something infinitely moreimportant than the ‘me’ I know.Is this not the secret of all poetry? Is this not why Shelley was so exalted bythe sheer power of the west wind? Back in London, I took a job at the Lyons Corner House in Coventry Street, thistime as a kitchen porter. It was pleasant enough; I was glad to have my mealssupplied, and began to put on weight. The only memory that makes me wince is ofan old cockney woman who worked behind the counter and who hated life. Shenagged and grumbled all day long, and wore a sour and disgusted expression. Inever took her seriously until one day the vile old thing saw me helping myselfto a cream cake, and reported me to the manageress. The latter was only mildlyreproachful, but my detestation of the old woman – which was so violent that Iwanted to hit her – made me decide to leave the job.It struck me then that no doubt her life was dull and frustrating, but she hadchosen to be negative about it, chosen to remain stuck in her sour littlesubjective values. I was becoming increasingly aware that human beings dieinside a prison cell of their own making unless they can find salvation bydirecting the whole being outwards, towards something impersonal.I continued to sleep on Hampstead Heath, always choosing the same spot under atree on a slope, but as the weather became colder, I decided to look for a roomagain. The trouble with the waterproof bag that encased my sleeping bag was thatperspiration was unable to escape, so the inside of the bag was always soaked inthe morning, and the inner bag was as wet as if it had been left out in therain. I usually risked sleeping without the waterproof outer cover, but as thewinter came on, this became more risky.So one Friday evening, I cycled over Blackfriars Bridge to south London, andstopped at every newsagent’s shop to look at the cards pinned outside. Finally,I found a room in Brockley, near New Cross station. My landlady was a plump,good-natured cockney with a large family. She was by far the nicest I hadencountered, having better things to do than nag her tenants. The address was 31Endwell Road, and I felt that the name was a good omen.I told her that Joy and I were married but that Joy was at a librarians’ school,so we could only spend weekends together. She knew perfectly well we weren’tmarried, but didn’t care. Joy spent every weekend with me.I was now in the midst of a phase of interest in the mystics, reading St John ofthe Cross, Jan van Ruysbroeck, Lorenzo Scupoli, William Law, Jakob Böhme and TheCloud of Unknowing. Luckily, Brockley Public Library had the best collection ofthe mystics in London – most of them in the reserve section in the basement, forthey were never taken out.I was becoming more and more obsessed by the question of what one could do in acivilisation like ours, which has no real symbol of spiritual values. In theMiddle Ages, if you had a temperament like mine, you simply renounced the worldand went into a monastery. It was an alternative you could choose; it was there,for anyone to see. But it had taken me ten years and more to understand theessence of religion, as distinguished from its dreary rituals: boring churchservices on Sunday mornings and even duller Sunday school on Sunday afternoons.I agreed with Eliot that religion ought to be something you could see and touch:the great soaring sweep of the nave of a cathedral, stained-glass windows, thechanting of monks by candlelight, gorgeous processions with purple and silverand the burning of incense.For this reason, I was strongly inclined to Catholicism. I occasionally warnedJoy that one day I might have to leave her and go into a monastery. It was notthat I wanted celibacy and a shaven head, only that I felt I had to find a wayof life that corresponded to my inner urges. I wanted to get away from thiscivilisation that forced me to conform to its material standards and tried tomake me believe that man was primarily a social animal.Toward Christmas, I bought a second-hand typewriter from a friend of Bill’s forseven pounds, and started to type out the first part of Ritual, now completed asfar as the end of Part One, the scene where Nunne becomes Nijinsky. FlaxHalliday visited me one day, and I read him parts of it. He was impressed by theNijinsky scene: ‘You didn’t put a foot wrong.’ He had grown tired of Leicester,and decided to become a policeman in the East End of London – anything forcolour and challenge. (Later he would join the Canadian Mounties for the samereason.)It was on this occasion that he told me the story – included later in ChapterTwo of Origins of the Sexual Impulse – of how he and another policeman spent thenight making love to a nymphomaniac art student, one after the other, with thelight on, until both had had half a dozen orgasms inside her. Meanwhile, Sybil –unconscious after a birthday party with lots of champagne – slumbered on in thenext bed. I was struck by the ending of the story: how Flax, having outperformedhis rival, had rolled off the girl when she finally complained of being sore,and had washed his hands and genitals at the sink, looked at the room ofprostrate bodies – the policeman had dropped out of the contest after his sixthclimax – and ‘I felt myself … the Victor.’ I noted this as an interestingexample of the will-to-power that drove Flax.Since Angus Wilson had told me he would be taking a few weeks’ holiday atChristmas, I completed typing up the first part of Ritual, and gave it to himthe day he left.I gave up the job at Lyons shortly before Christmas 1954 to work in the postoffice of St Martin le Grand, sorting Christmas mail. I spent Christmas Dayalone in my room, writing – Joy had gone home to see her parents. They hadbecome more or less reconciled to me by now, and wanted us to get married – Ihad not yet explained to them that I was already married.I felt at a loose end without Ritual. That afternoon, after a lunch of egg,bacon and tinned tomatoes, I decided to sketch out the ‘Outsider’ book that Ihad planned before I married Betty. Having read Camus’s Outsider, I was muchintrigued by the passive hero – smoking, making love and lounging in the sun. Hereminded me of Krebs, the hero of Hemingway’s story ‘Soldier’s Home’, whoexperiences a similar feeling of indifference when he returns to his home townin the mid-west after World War One. And Krebs in turn recalled Oliver inGranville-Barker’s play The Secret Life.Something began to take shape in my mind, and I wrote at the top of a page in myjournal: ‘Notes for a book The Outsider in Literature. To show that the“outsider” is evidence of a particular type of moral development that has itsfinest fruit in the Christian tradition’. I was speaking, of course, of St Johnof the Cross and Meister Eckhart.The outline that followed was very substantially The Outsider as it was finallywritten, except that there was a chapter on ‘The Weak Outsider’ – Oblomov, theGreat Gatsby, Ernest Dowson, Hamlet and Villiers de L’Isle Adam’s Axel – and asection on ‘criminal Outsiders’, a group in which I included Jack the Ripper andthe Düsseldorf sadist Peter Kurten.As soon as the British Museum opened in the new year, I cycled there to beginthe book. I was, of course, anxious to see Angus, but he was away for a month.On the way, I recalled how the introduction to Henri Barbusse’s Under Fire hadmentioned that the novelist’s first success was a book called Hell (L’Enfer),about a man who discovers a small hole in the wall of his room, and spends hisdays peering through it at the life that comes and goes in the next room. Thiswas obviously the perfect symbol for the ‘Outsider’. So as soon as I arrived atthe museum, I looked up the novel in the catalogue and ordered it. When itarrived I settled down and read it from beginning to end. Then I copied aparagraph into my notebook: > In the air, on top of a tram, a girl is sitting. Her dress, lifted a little,> blows out. But a block in the traffic separates us. The tramcar glides away,> fading like a nightmare.> Moving in both directions, the street is full of dresses which sway, offering> themselves airily, the skirts lifting; dresses that lift and yet do not lift.> In the tall and narrow shop mirror I see myself approaching, rather pale and> heavy-eyed. It is not a woman I want – it is all women, and I seek for them in> those around me, one by one … It was obvious that Barbusse is talking basically about sex, and about the factthat it contains a frustrating element of illusion. His hero takes a prostituteto bed, but finds it banal and disappointing. For sex, like Yeats’s waterfall,proves that: > Nothing we love overmuch> Is ponderable to the touch …As I left the museum at five o’clock, I knew I had the beginnings of a book.I had plenty of material. For years now, I had continued to keep my journal,noting down anything that interested me in the books I read, trying to relatetogether various works of ‘outsider’ literature and my own experiences. I havemy journal for the period by me as I write. It is full of entries on Rimbaud,Axel, Raskolnikov, Steppenwolf, Rilke, Niebuhr’s Nature and Destiny of Man,Nietzsche, Meister Eckhart, Ramakrishna and George Fox. Early versions of Ritualwere full of obscure references to them, until I decided that the kind of novelI wanted to write should not be overweighted with quotations.Another important insight had come as I was walking along the Embankment pastCharing Cross underground, talking to Bill Hopkins about the plot of Ritual. Iexplained that its three main characters represent the three different types ofOutsider. The hero, Gerard Sorme, is an intellectual Outsider like Nietzsche –he has great discipline of the intellect, but not of the emotions or the body.The painter Oliver Glasp has great emotional discipline, like Van Gogh, but notof the intellect or the body. And the killer, Austin Nunne, has physicaldiscipline, like Nijinsky, but not of the intellect or the emotions. Combinedtogether they would form a unified human being instead of three incompletebeings.Dostoevsky had used the three Karamazov brothers to symbolise the same problem:Ivan, the intellect, Mitya, the body, Alyosha, the emotions. This is why TheBrothers Karamazov came to occupy such a central position in The Outsider.To begin with, the book went slowly. Since I had run out of money I had to findanother job – according to my journal I owed Joy two pounds. So I went to thelocal Labour Exchange, and was directed to a laundry, this time in Deptford.This job was one of the hardest I ever had. We worked in shifts, starting atseven in the morning. Rusty tin baths full of wet clothes came past on a movingbelt, and we had to empty these as fast as we could. My hands were soon coveredwith cuts from the baths. The pace was so hectic that we worked for twentyminutes, and then had a ten-minute break (when I carried on learning my Greekvocabulary).It had started to snow heavily, so that it was difficult to cycle to work. Atsix o’clock in the morning, it was too dark to see the snowdrifts, so Ifrequently cycled into them. It was safer to walk most of the way.But I liked Deptford, with its cobbled streets, and its cranes against theskyline and great ships in the docks. It had not changed greatly since the daysof 1905 when the Stratton brothers were hanged for the murder of an old couple –the case is remarkable because it was the first time in England that men werehanged on fingerprint evidence.But I soon found myself disliking the job when my journals were stolen from mycoat pocket one day. Someone must have opened them at one of the entries on sex,and decided that they would make good bedtime reading. (They were not highlydescriptive, but I had mentioned that night Joy and I slept on Maurice Willows’sfloor, and she had not objected when I slipped my hand up her dress.) I hadbound together three or four pocket-sized notebooks, so it covered about a year,and was a considerable loss. I tried offering a reward, but to no effect. Unableto bear the sight of the place, I gave in my notice and left in disgust."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8> BREAKTHROUGHAt the end of January 1955, an acquaintance told me that a new Coffee House wasopening in the Haymarket and would need staff. I cycled in and was taken on as adishwasher. My journal for 4 February contains the entry: > This morning is the first beautiful day since November – I’ve been able to sit> in bed reading and drinking coffee with the window open, without the gas ring> on to warm the room, the sunlight everywhere. The Coffee House job in the> evenings suits me well enough – not tiresome yet, and needn’t become so if I> discipline myself not to let time drag. They give me sandwiches to bring home> and I eat them all day and so save myself buying food …By ‘disciplining myself’ I meant refusing to let myself slip into boredom, nomatter how tired I became.In fact, the job was the most enjoyable I’d ever had. For the first time since Ileft school I was working mainly with young people of my own age; they weremostly drama students or art students. The surroundings were pleasant – therewas an enormous fountain in the centre of the floor made of sheets of colouredglass placed at angles that allowed the water to run down them into a basin. Wewere allowed to help ourselves to food and drink. The manageress was a bouncy,noisy bohemian lady called Gabriele Grahame-King, who loved her job, and had atendency to engage queers because she liked them.I used to cycle there from the British Museum, and carry my bike downstairs tothe basement, where I worked. But after a few weeks, they took me offdishwashing and let me serve behind the counter. This was a completely differentworld for me, civilised and amusing.Gradually, I relaxed. It was like heaving a huge, slow sigh of relief. I wouldspend days in the British Museum, writing The Outsider at a great speed – for Ihad been thinking about its subjects for years – and then work in the CoffeeHouse from five thirty until about eleven thirty. When the theatre crowds cameout after ten, the job became suddenly hectic, and it needed precisecoordination to keep four coffee machines working at the same time. If I forgotto start the coffee percolating the moment a machine was empty, it would mean aten-minute wait for the queue of customers.When we all went downstairs at the end of the evening and removed our whitejackets, there was a warm feeling of comradeship, of liking everybody – evenpeople you normally found boring.As I wrote The Outsider I had a feeling of enormous excitement. It was pouringout of me like molten lava out of a volcano, and I knew it was good. I waswriting about myself, seeing myself mirrored in Van Gogh, Nijinsky, Nietzsche,T. E. Lawrence. I was writing of men who had been half-forgotten –Granville-Barker, Leonid Andreyev, Hermann Hesse. (Significantly, most ofHesse’s books came back into print after The Outsider, and several books werewritten about him. I have most of them, and not one of them mentions my book.The reason will appear presently.) The theme of the book was the misfits inmodern civilisation, the creative men who feel out of place in the rat race.There is a sense in which the origin of The Outsider lies in a paragraph fromLawrence’s Seven Pillars of Wisdom. It describes Lawrence’s feelings as he setout at dawn with an Arab raiding party: > We started out on one of those clear dawns that wake up the senses with the> sun, while the intellect, tired of the thinking of the night, was yet abed.> For an hour or two on such a morning, the sounds, scents and colours of the> world struck man individually and directly: they seemed to exist sufficiently> by themselves, and the lack of design and carefulness in creation no longer> irritated. I had experienced many such mornings in my teens, when I set out to cycle toWarwick or Stratford or Matlock, and I recognised that feeling of sheer joy, thesense that none of the miseries of the world really mattered. What I wasexperiencing was what the German writer Gottfried Benn called ‘primalperception’, when everything looks new and sparkling, and we realise that ourbasic problem is the tendency of the mind to soil and taint the world with itsthoughts, as we would soil a sheet of white paper by handling it with dirtyfingers. That is what I wanted to write about: the fact that gloom and despairwould be impossible if we could understand the hidden powers of the human mind.That is why I took care to state that the Outsider is not necessarily creative.His lack of self-understanding may be so complete that he never even begins toachieve the catharsis of creation. Van Gogh and Nietzsche had burst into adefinite flame of affirmation; most outsiders only smoulder and produce a blacksmoke that chokes themselves and everybody around them. I was to become aware ofa great deal of this among the younger generation in America, some ten yearslater.I was so confident of what I was writing that I noted in my journal: ‘This bookwill be the Waste Land of the fifties, and should be the most important book ofits generation.’I was still living at New Cross, but one day a letter came from Betty once againthreatening to sue me for maintenance. I had not sent her money since I startedsleeping out on Hampstead Heath. I gave my landlady notice – with some regret –and moved.I found a room in a slum area behind Gray’s Inn Road. It cost less than the NewCross room, but to get into my bedroom, I had to pass through the family’ssitting room. One night when I had been there for a week, an acquaintance toldme he had just been thrown out of his lodgings and had nowhere to go. I took himhome with me for the night, and the next morning we had to pass through thefamily’s quarters on the way out. That evening, the landlady gave me notice.But as usual this turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Gabby – themanageress at the Coffee House – said she knew of a friend with a room to let inNottingham Place, near Baker Street. It was a pleasant basement flat. Being afriend of Gabby’s, my new landlady, Inger, was casual, easygoing and tolerant ofvisitors, even if they stayed all night. I wrote a lot of The Outsider here, ondays when I was too lazy to go to the museum. Life was more satisfying than formany years. I had an intuition that fate had at last changed its policy, anddecided to stop hounding me.My life had also changed in another respect. When I came to work at the CoffeeHouse, I found it very pleasant to be surrounded by attractive young dramastudents, and flirted mildly. Joy, who was now studying to be a librarian inEaling, was still very much the centre of my world, but she came to stay with meonly at weekends. Inevitably, if one is in contact with attractive girls for dayafter day, week after week, flirtations have a chance to develop. I used to walkhome with a sweet and quiet art student named Marina, who shared a room nearVictoria station with a girl called Cynthia. Once or twice I accepted herinvitation to go up and have tea with them. One evening, for some reason, shecame back to my room. She knew about Joy, and she herself had a boyfriend whowanted to marry her, so there was no question of starting an affaire. Ratherthan walk home in the early hours of the morning, she slept in my bed betweenthe sheets, fully clothed, while I slept under the eiderdown.Nothing happened, except that I felt it would be a pity not to kiss such anattractive girl when she was lying beside me, particularly since she obviouslywanted me to. We were both playing with fire, and rather enjoying it.On the next occasion she again slept fully clothed but this time I joined herbetween the sheets. And on the occasion after that, she removed most of herclothes. It was still understood that we had no intention of becoming lovers –at least, it was pleasant to tell ourselves so. As a last line of defence forvirtue we both wore our underwear. The truth was that it was much more pleasantto play this kind of game than to take off our clothes and have sex. It wasanother example of Frankl’s law of reverse effort.There came the night when, as I was lying between her thighs, with my erectionpushing at the barrier of her cotton panties, it seemed absurd not to gofurther, and I pulled the barrier aside and entered her. The pleasure was sointense that I had to withdraw immediately. I felt ashamed that I had terminatedher pleasure.We both felt we had spoiled our game. We didn’t want to have an affaire; wewanted to play with fire. So Marina never came back to my room again. In anycase, she met a new male employee of the Coffee House, broke with her previousboyfriend, and started a serious relationship.I had always known that healthy men and women are interested in sex quite apartfrom the desire for permanent involvements. I had my permanent involvement withJoy, and nothing would have persuaded me to do anything that might damage it.Ever since that first night in bed together, I had felt in some sense married toher. But the kind of mild sensuality I had enjoyed with Marina was certainly nothreat to that.Behind the coffee counter I was partnered at different times by a number ofattractive girls, and two more came back to my room during that summer. With agirl called Hazel nothing happened except that we shared the same bed andexchanged a few kisses. The other, a girl named Jo, came back with the intentionof making love, and took off all her clothes before she climbed into bed. Andthe law of reverse effort saw to it that I had lost all interest in her by thenext morning.Not long after that, I served coffee to a pretty blonde of about seventeen, whointroduced herself as Carole Ann. She had a well-developed figure, and was pert,lively and good-natured. Her parents lived in Petts Wood, a middle-class areasouth of London, and she was a drama student at the polytechnic in RegentStreet. She also worked in a record shop in the City, and since the next day washer half-day, she came to the British Museum to see me, and I showed her theEgyptian and Assyrian rooms, after which we sat in the tea shop and exchangeddetails about ourselves. Carole Ann was remarkably frank. She had met an actorwho attracted her, and agreed to spend the night with him in Brighton becauseshe thought it was time she lost her virginity. But that had been frustrated bya train strike …Sensing that she saw me as a substitute for the actor, I told her about Joy, andabout how Joy had broken off her engagement to come to London. And when CaroleAnn came to the Coffee House the next day, I invited her back to my room onSaturday – to meet Joy. I introduced her to Joy simply as a girl I had met inthe Coffee House. But later that evening, after we had all been out for ciderand sandwiches, and I was walking Carole Ann back to the underground, she saidseriously: ‘I was furiously jealous of Joy before I met her, but now I can seewhy you intend to stay with her.’ She hesitated. ‘But I’d like you to be myfirst lover all the same.’I felt it would have been absurd to reject her invitation. I had concealednothing from her, and could not be accused of setting out to seduce her. As withMarina, it was a matter of two adult people of opposite sexes deciding to giveone another pleasure. So two evenings later, she came back to my room. After afew preliminary kisses I removed her skirt and knickers, and we got into bed.But it was not as simple as she had expected. In Ritual in the Dark, in whichCarole Ann appears as Caroline, I describe the difficulties of making love toher, but for the sake of dramatic unity I do not mention that it took twoevenings.Carole Ann and I continued to see one another for about a year, and to enjoy apleasant relationship in which there was no deep commitment on either side.During that period I drifted into another involvement. Her name was Dorothy, andshe appears in my second novel, Adrift in Soho, as Doreen. She worked in atheatrical costumier near the Coffee House, and was pretty, dark haired and shy.Because she often came in for coffee, things were again allowed to develop at agentle pace. I met her one morning in Harrods, and a few evenings later took herout to a pub and introduced her to Bill Hopkins. She came back to my room but,even though she missed her last train, insisted on taking a night bus toKensington.On the next occasion she stayed the night, but slept fully clothed. But halfwaythrough the night, her bra felt uncomfortable and she sat up and removed it, notrealising that when a man finds himself in bed with a girl with naked breasts –particularly beautifully developed breasts – he assumes it is an invitation togo further. Dorothy was obviously shocked when I tried to remove the rest of herclothes, and I was made to desist.She showed the same curious innocence when I went to the flat she shared with abeautiful and sophisticated girl called Francesca, whose boyfriends called forher in two-seater sports cars. I was kissing Dorothy on her bed and she wasobviously becoming increasingly excited. She sighed and opened her legs wide,and I naturally lost no time in placing my hand between them. She instantlyfroze, and I realised that the movement had been quite instinctive andautomatic.It sounds as if I was carrying out a planned campaign of seduction, but this wasnot true. I would not have cared in the least if nothing had happened. I simplyfound a magic in these relationships: in sitting in a pub and eating a sausagesandwich and drinking cider, or feeding the ducks in Hyde Park, with a prettygirl beside me. If Dorothy had found another boyfriend, like Marina, it wouldnot have made me jealous. I felt that social life ought to be this casual, easyinvolvement of the sexes, simply enjoying what each has to offer.In the case of Dorothy there was a gradual drift into physical involvement. WhenFrancesca moved out, a girl named Fenella moved in, and Bill and I often wentthere for a meal, taking bottles of beer or cider. We flirted with both of them.Sometimes, my Leicester friend David Campton came along. Occasionally, afterFenella had changed into her nightie and climbed into bed, I would lie on thebed beside her, kissing her. Then I noted the truth of Flax’s observation that awoman feels it to be quite innocent if a man slips off the shoulder-strap of hernightdress and kisses her breasts, or caresses her nipple between his lips. Witha layer of bedclothes between them she feels as secure as if wearing armour.One evening after Fenella had gone to bed, Dorothy and I lay kissing on thesitting-room carpet. She had been nervous about sex, but was now used to me. Shemade no objection when I raised her skirt and removed her knickers. I don’tthink she enjoyed our first attempt at lovemaking, but purely as an operation itwas successful.It was bound to end in tears. One evening I came back late from work and foundJoy crying, with a diary of mine on the carpet. It was a bad weekend, and Iwince when I recall it. She was not the type of person to fly into a temper andwalk out; she was too gentle and dependent. I certainly had no desire to hurther, and yet obviously I had.But Joy had one advantage: I had no intention of giving her up – I knew when Iwas well off. It was Carole Ann and Dorothy who had to be given up. Carole Annsoon found another admirer, and bore me no ill will; we even continued to seeone another occasionally. Dorothy eventually went to Spain with an art studentwho had been pursuing her for months. Bill, whose affairs were mostly conductedon a more casual basis, chuckled at my discomfiture.Some time later – perhaps a year – I bumped into Dorothy in St Martin’s Lane,looking quite beautiful in a powder-blue suit, and she told me she was on herway to get married. She looked so lovely I was almost jealous.Joy, still studying librarianship in Ealing, came over every weekend. She hadjoined a friendly group consisting of another female student and two males, asstudents will, and once when I went to see her in her lodgings, one of the maleswas there. I was not jealous: he was bearded, with a London accent, and I felthe offered no kind of competition, even though it was clear he had fallen inlove with Joy. She told me that he had asked her if she slept with me when shecame over for the weekend, and she admitted she did. This apparently threw himinto a frenzy of jealousy, and he begged her to go to bed with him. I feltalmost sympathetic, for I could put myself in his place.One evening, when I had cycled over to Ealing, I left him with Joy, and as I waswalking up to the Underground, he cycled past and spat at me. This struck me asstupid and boorish, and I told Joy so. She took him to task about it, and toldme he looked ashamed.A few months later, when she was changing her lodgings, Joy left a suitcase inmy room. I looked inside it, and found a batch of letters from him, which madeit clear that he was not only obsessed with Joy, but that they had been engagingin lovemaking. It was as if a bomb had exploded inside my head, and I feltphysically sick. Of course, I had no right to be angry, in view of my owninfidelities, but sex is not a matter of reason. I tried to ring Joy. She wasout and I left a message. When she rang me back I was packing my belongings inpreparation for finding another room. I told her I had discovered the loveletters and said I was leaving at once. She begged me to wait for her. An hourlater, when she arrived, I was in a worse state than ever.She swore that she had never given herself to him. I pointed out a passage inwhich he talked about the pleasure of feeling her tender thighs pressed againsthis. This, she said, was mere romanticism; they had never done more than kiss.I was inclined to believe her, remembering my rival’s unattractive face andstraggly beard. I certainly wanted to believe her, for Joy had become for me asymbol of the eternal feminine, and the thought of her giving herself shocked medeeply, as I had once been shocked to learn that Queen Guinevere gave herself toSir Lancelot. Besides, I had known Joy long enough to know that she was hardlythe unfaithful type. I was aware that in the past few months Flax had been tovisit her in her room, and she admitted to me that he had propositioned her, andbeen promptly turned down. So I allowed myself to be convinced. But the music Ihad been listening to as I read the letters – D’Indy’s Symphony on a FrenchMountain Song – was quite spoiled for me, until I decided that it was stupid tohave one of my favourite pieces of music ruined by a boorish lout, anddeliberately played it again and again until I had erased its associations. Butfor many years I would wake up out of a dream that Joy had been unfaithful, andfeel again that same torment.Joy and I continued to spend weekends together, and we occasionally hitch-hikedto places we wanted to see: Cambridge, Stratford (which I knew from my teens),Chichester, Arundel, Brecon. One day, when I was already working on the fourthchapter of The Outsider, we decided to hitch-hike to Canterbury, and on the waypassed through Tilbury, where we explored a second-hand bookshop. There I cameupon an anthology of religious mysticism called A Year of Grace, edited by thepublisher Victor Gollancz. I bought it, and it was while Joy and I werewandering around Canterbury Cathedral that it suddenly struck me that Gollanczmight be interested in The Outsider. He was obviously a man who would agree withmy basic theme, the defence of religious values.The next task was to type out what I had already written, for the book was inmanuscript. At this time I was doing a day job as well as my evening one.Maurice Willows had come to London, and found a job sitting by a telephone allday in a builder’s office. He was giving it up, and suggested I take over. SinceI could go on writing my book there, I found it an excellent suggestion.Besides, as there was a typewriter there, I was able to type out The Outsider.I was soon quarrelling with a thoroughly unpleasant foreman who felt I was beingpaid for nothing, and objected to my making tea on the gas ring. He would hidethe ring; I would find it, and have my tea boiling away whenever he came intothe office. He even tried hiding the typewriter, but I would find it again –perhaps hidden in the basement.One day I told him to go to Hell, and he told me I was fired. But by this time,I had typed out the first four chapters of The Outsider. I wrote Gollancz a longletter, and sent him an outline of the book, together with selected pages. Hereplied almost by return post, saying that he thought it probable that he wouldwant to publish it – would I send him the completed typescript? In retrospect, I have one major criticism of The Outsider: it is too romantic.Its mood of world-rejection, of disgust with civilisation, sprang from my yearsof struggle, and now seems to me too absolute.As a child I had always been religious, and used to pray as I walked along thestreet, particularly if my mother was ill or worried. My period of nihilism putan end to that, but later, as I read my favourite poetry – Shelley, Keats, Eliot– I realised that all true poets are basically religious because they possess asense of the sheer magic of the universe, which involves a sense of a benevolentforce behind creation. So it seemed to me clear that humanism – the feeling thatmen are alone in an empty universe – is nonsense. The Outsider was meant to bean argument for religion and against humanism.It seems to me now that the distinction I then made between religion andhumanism is a false one. I knew that I sympathised with Eliot, and agreed withhim that ‘civilization cannot survive without religion’. I knew that I had nopatience with the anaemic, university-trained humanism of Kathleen Nott in TheEmperor’s Clothes, her attack on Eliot, Greene and other defenders of thereligious attitude. But the truth is that the basic position of The Outsider ishumanistic.I had been divided for years in my attitude towards religion. I was in totalintellectual agreement with the ‘dynamic’ religion of the saints (to use HenriBergson’s terminology), the religion whose aim is union with God, but I had nosympathy for the ‘static’ religion that develops from it. By temperament I wasnot fitted to be a member of any group or congregation. I was irritated by thepessimism of religious intellectuals – Eliot, Greene, Marcel, Bernanos,Kierkegaard, Simone Weil. I was equally irritated by the shallow materialism andintellectual complacency that I found in Bertrand Russell and A. J. Ayer, andfelt no hesitation in choosing between them and the religious faction.My mistake was in supposing the choice was necessary, for I had as little – oras much – in common with Kierkegaard as with Russell. I should have asked myselfthe question: which would be easier: to deepen philosophy until it includes theinsights of religion, or to somehow ‘humanise’ religion? The answer was obvious:to deepen philosophy. Whitehead – a philosopher I admired enormously – certainlythought so. As it was, I rejected Kierkegaard’s dead-end pessimism aboutphilosophy, and stuck to my Shavian evolutionism, without seeing that this mademe a humanist. It is a pity that I use the word ‘humanism’ as a term ofopprobrium in The Outsider. I should have risked inventing a word like‘Russellism’.There was one important influence on the writing of The Outsider that I have notmentioned: my friend Stuart Holroyd. I have spoken about Alfred Reynolds, theHungarian Jew who was forced to flee to England from the Nazis. Stuart Holroydwas one of his disciples, and had a ravishingly pretty wife called Anne; theyhad been married since they were seventeen.Stuart said very little; he was a quiet bird. But I found him intelligent. Oneday, I suggested to Alfred that I might give a reading of extracts of myfavourite literature at one of his Bridge meetings. This sounded harmless enoughto him, so he agreed.What I then did was to choose extracts that all illustrated my point: that humannature has evolutionary cravings that go beyond ‘reason’, and that may turn toviolence if unexpressed. I selected some of the more horrifying passages fromLawrence’s Seven Pillars, and from Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Tolstoy, Van Gogh (theletters), Blake, and so on.I knew Stuart loved the metaphysical poets, so I asked him if he would read someextracts from Donne, Herbert and Blake for me. He not only agreed, he saw what Iwas getting at, and felt that I had a point. The reading was a success, althoughAlfred complained at one point, ‘You are twisting a knife in my bowels.’ Hedidn’t agree with me, though. And he was naturally unhappy about the defectionof one of his favourite disciples.I discovered that Stuart was trying to write for a living. He produced articlesfor a little poetry magazine, while his wife kept them going by working as ashorthand typist. Stuart knew a great deal of poetry, but had read very littleelse. I introduced him to Dostoevsky, to William James’s Varieties of ReligiousExperience, to existentialism, to the work of Hesse and Rilke. Stuart becameenthusiastic about the latter’s Duino Elegies, and suggested to the poetrymagazine that they allow him to write an article comparing them with Eliot’sFour Quartets. I spent an evening outlining my ideas for such an article, andStuart finally accumulated so much material that he persuaded the magazine toallow him to expand it into three articles – one on Rilke, one on Eliot, and onecomparing the two. In due course, these articles appeared, and I read them.I must admit that I experienced a kind of jealousy to see so many of my ideas inprint under someone else’s name. It was shortly after that that Stuart told mehe had decided to expand the articles into a book about poetry and religion.This would become Emergence from Chaos, which was later published by Gollancz inEngland, and by Houghton Mifflin in America.But when I realised that Stuart really meant to write a critical book, I decidedit was time I wrote one too. It is true that there is no copyright in ideas, andStuart had a mind of his own. But by introducing him to so many writers whomeant so much to me, I had given him a stake in the same field of ideas. Thiswas one of the reasons that I wrote The Outsider at such a speed: I wanted toget it out before Emergence from Chaos.Joy and I saw a lot of Stuart at their flat while I was writing The Outsider. Irecall a party at their room in Belsize Park when Joy, quiteuncharacteristically, drank too much and was sick in the sink. After that sheflopped on the divan bed and passed out. Her stocking-clad legs, visible to theknees, looked so delicious that I tugged her skirt halfway up her thighs so theother male guests could admire them. When I told Joy the next day, she said:‘Oh, you swine!’ but said it with her usual mildness and tolerance. My grandmother died when I was writing The Outsider. I was sorry, for I had beenvery fond of her. She was a rather saintly woman who had the same kind andgentle temperament as Joy. When I had been in my mid-teens, I had gone thereevery Saturday afternoon to write – a volume called ‘Essays on the Life Aim’ anda book on Shaw (which I called The Quintessence of Shavianism), an analysis ofthe plays that I never finished. It would have given me enormous pleasure togive her the first copy of my first book.And then, in late May, my mother suddenly became very ill. She had inherited hermother’s gentle temperament, and I suppose I felt about her the same deepattachment that D. H. Lawrence felt towards his mother, accompanied by a certainimpatience with my father, since he and my mother had as little in common asLawrence’s parents, and I felt he treated her as a household servant – certainlythey were about as ill-assorted a couple as I have ever come across. She haddeveloped a stomach pain and the doctor had prescribed Alka-Seltzer. It wasactually a rumbling appendix, and when it exploded, she had an operation forperitonitis. This was unsuccessful, and she was operated on again, while stillvery weak. This was also unsuccessful. It looked as if I might also be losingher before The Outsider saw print. So I decided to return to Leicester.I had written about half the book – which was then called The Pain Threshold –and before I caught the train to Leicester I called at Gollancz’s office inCovent Garden, and asked a secretary if I could leave the book. She said that MrGollancz never looked at unfinished books, and advised me to take it away andsend it when it was finished. I explained that I was about to go to Leicester,where my mother was ill, and might be away for months – could I not simply leavethe typescript there? If he didn’t have time to look at it, I would collect itwhen I came back. Reluctantly, she agreed.In Leicester I went immediately to see my mother, who looked very sick andfrail. There was not much I could do except visit her regularly, but veryslowly, after more operations, she improved, although she suddenly looked tenyears older than her forty-three years.As soon as she was out of danger, I returned to London, and was delighted tofind a letter from Victor Gollancz waiting for me. He said he had read mytypescript, and would definitely publish it.I was overwhelmed: it seemed incredible that I was going to be a publishedauthor. I rushed to Ealing to tell Joy, and found the bearded type there. But Ifelt almost benevolent towards him; Gollancz’s letter made everything else seemunimportant.What worried me now was whether I could keep up the same standard for the restof the book. What if Gollancz didn’t like the second half? But I lost no timewriting to my mother to tell her my book had been accepted.It was now mid-June, and Gollancz wanted the completed typescript bymid-September. That meant three months of non-stop work. I could no longer sparethe time to write in longhand, then type it out. To begin with, I thought thesolution might be to try dictating it to a typist. I found a girl at the CoffeeHouse who could take shorthand, and went to her room in south London to try theexperiment. I began by saying: ‘This is chapter seven, and it is to be called“The Great Synthesis”. Put that in capitals, and follow it with a row of dots.’I meant the dots to go underneath the title, but she misunderstood me, andtyped: ‘The Great Synthesis …’ I never bothered to remove the three leader dots,and they are still included in every edition of The Outsider in the world.I dictated the ‘Great Synthesis’ chapter, then decided that dictating took toolong; so – with misgivings – I began to type the book straight on to thetypewriter. I found this just as easy as handwriting, and have used this methodever since.The book continued to flow easily, and I often wrote ten pages (2,500 words) aday. There were distractions. My landlady’s mother went insane one morning,smashing milk bottles all over the road, and had to be taken off to an asylum.Bill Hopkins almost got me thrown out of my flat after he had slept on the floorone night. He went home by the first bus, then rang me back at six a.m. to askif he had left his tobacco behind. My landlady got out of bed to answer thephone, opened the door of my room, and saw two more of my Soho friends asleep onthe floor. Her comments were justifiably acid, and I started thinking aboutmoving yet again.Joy and I returned to the West Country in August, cycling this time. We loved itthere, with its old-fashioned pubs that sold draught cider, and views from thetops of cliffs. I can still recall walking with Joy up the hill out of LymeRegis, and looking at the sea birds nesting on ledges on the face of the cliff,and experiencing a surge of sheer exultation – the feeling that I was with alovely girl and on holiday and, moreover, didn’t have to go back to a factory oroffice. I felt suddenly that life was entirely good, and that only our habitualmistrust turns it sour. And I could see clearly that it is this sourness thatcauses misfortune and invites disaster; if we could stay relaxed andaffirmative, all life would be good.We were both full of optimism. Ever since Gollancz had written to say that hewould definitely publish The Pain Threshold, I had experienced an intoxicatingsense of having finally broken through. At last, after eight years during whichI had been constantly ‘plagued by crowds’, I felt I could afford to relax andenjoy life. The days when I feared I would never achieve a breakthrough nowseemed a bad dream. I had found a girl who suited me perfectly, I had a job Ienjoyed, a reasonable landlady, and my first book had been accepted. The holidaystays in my mind as having a golden glow about it.It was pleasant having Joy; she was such a sweet-tempered and good-natured girlthat everybody liked her. Men tended to fall in love with her – her fiancé hadapparently proposed to her a few hours after meeting her at a dance in Dublin;evidently she had had the same effect on him that she had on me.Back in the British Museum, I learned that Angus Wilson had read the first partof Ritual and liked it. Now, when I told him that Gollancz was interested in mynew book, he suggested that I allow his own publisher, Fred Warburg, of Seckerand Warburg, to see it. Warburg seemed bored when I took the manuscript in, buttwenty-four hours later he rang me up in great excitement to say that he wouldgive me a contract and an advance immediately. I decided to make no instantdecision, but this offer seemed to confirm my own feeling that this was a bookthat could make immediate impact.Only two years before, I had decided that I was prepared to wait for recognitionuntil I was fifty. My reasoning was that there was no point in waiting for theacceptance of my first book before I began my writing career; I might as wellstart now, and drop the books into a drawer; then, when success came, I mighthave a dozen more books to offer for publication. Now it seemed clear that suchstoicism would not be necessary after all.Sometime before Christmas, I began to work part time at the other Coffee Housein Northumberland Avenue, and to work on Ritual again. Gollancz had accepted mycompleted book (suggesting I change the title to The Outsider) and given me atwenty-five pound advance, with another fifty due on publication.I had finally decided to let Gollancz have it rather than Secker and Warburgbecause Fred Warburg wanted me to make several alterations in it. He thought thechapter on Lawrence, Van Gogh and Nijinsky deserved to be enlarged. Gollancz wassatisfied with it as it stood, so, being lazy, I accepted Gollancz’s offer.Altogether, it was amusing to have two publishers vying for my work. Gollancz,while in many ways a delightful man, had a tendency to fly into rages of furiousself-righteousness, and Warburg’s attempt to lure away one of his writers hadhim spluttering with indignation.It was Gollancz who took me out to my first expensive meal in a restaurant. Wehad smoked salmon – which has been a favourite of mine ever since – and someexcellent red wine to follow. He was a big man with a large stomach and abooming, Oxford voice. In his office building he was regarded as a demon. Oneday when I was sitting in the office of my editor, John Rosenberg, there was afurious shout of ‘How dahr you? How dahr you?’ followed by a crashing down thestairs outside. I asked John: ‘What on earth’s going on?’ and John said lightly:‘Oh, it’s only VG kicking Brian downstairs.’ Brian was Gollancz’s assistant.As we walked from VG’s office to the restaurant – in St Martin’s Lane – VGasked: ‘How on earth have you succeeded in reading so much at your age?’ Andafter that lunch I wrote and told my mother that Gollancz had told me: ‘I thinkit possible that you may be a man of genius.’ It was a conclusion I had reachedyears before, but it was pleasant to hear it confirmed.On the evening of Gollancz’s definite acceptance of the book, Joy and I went tothe Carlton Cinema to see Leslie Caron and Fred Astaire in Daddy Longlegs.Astaire’s number ‘Something’s Gotta Give’ can still bring back the memory ofthose exciting days when I play the record. I had always enjoyed reading aboutearly success in biographies of my favourite writers – Wells, Shaw, Chesterton;now I seemed about to experience it, and it was more delightful than I hadanticipated.I delivered the finished Outsider to Gollancz in early October, and went back toworking on Ritual. I experienced misgivings about devoting so much of the bookto criminality and sadism, and decided to consult the I Ching. The result washexagram 61, Inner Truth, and my scalp tingled as I read the words: > Thus the superior man discusses criminal cases> In order to delay executions.After that I felt no more qualms about discussing murder. And the appositenessof the quotation dissolved any lingering doubts I had about fate and Jungiansynchronicity. How could I not believe that my struggles had been directed bysome fate that had my best interests at heart?In late October, I was surprised to receive a telephone call from a woman calledGwenda David, who explained that she was the representative of the AmericanViking Press, and wanted to offer them The Outsider. The idea delighted me,since I was (as usual) broke, and hoped she might persuade them to give me anadvance. I went to have tea with her in her house in Hampstead. She was a small,attractive woman in her forties, whose husband, Eric Mosbacher, worked on TheTimes. We liked one another immediately. I was impressed with the row of theViking Portable Library on her shelf, and sat reading the Nietzsche so avidlythat she gave it to me. I still have the copy, full of my notes.Alas, nothing came of this. Just before Christmas 1955 – when an advance wouldhave been welcome – Viking finally turned it down.Over the pre-Christmas period, I again worked in the post office at StMartin-le-Grand. This was always enjoyable, because you met such an interestingcross-section of people. There was a cadaverous sports journalist named JohnKerr, who looked like Edgar Allan Poe but had a pleasantly dry sense of humour.There was a smartly-dressed ex-army officer named Goodall, who was sixty-five,and told me that he had been the original inspiration for Noël Coward’s song‘Mad Dogs and Englishmen’. In Malaya, he had developed a skin complaint of thescalp, and had been recommended to sit out in the midday sun. Coward had seenhim and asked what on earth he was doing; the result was the famous song.Goodall told me how, many years later, he wanted to get into a Noël Coward showin Piccadilly Circus, but there were no seats left. So he sent a note up toCoward’s dressing room, and signed it ‘Mad dogs and Englishman’. The messengercame back with a ticket.Christmas came, and I went to Leicester. My mother was home, looking tired andold, but slowly recovering after five operations. I could now go into theColeman Road Working Men’s Club with my father and be introduced as ‘an author’.My position was no longer ambiguous.After Christmas I decided that it was time to change my lodgings again. Thistime, I had no complaint to make of my landlady. But fifty shillings a week wasmore than I could afford when I had only a few pounds to last me untilpublication day the following May. I saw an advertisement on a notice board inNotting Hill, and rang the number. A girl with a pleasant voice invited me to goand see her.The house was on a corner in Chepstow Villas, and was completely dilapidated. Ithad stood empty for many years, but its owner had now given it to her daughter,Anne Nichols – the girl with the pleasant voice. She had thought of making aliving by renting rooms, but since the house was in appalling condition, withpeeling wallpaper and shattered windows, she needed someone to help her get itinto a state of repair. I explained my own need – a very cheap room – and shemade me an offer: I could have the upstairs bathroom for a pound a week (it hadno bath, only a disused lavatory), if I would help her to get the rest of thehouse into order. I agreed, and moved in.It was a freezing January, and I had no furniture. I slept in my sleeping bag onthe bare floorboards of the bathroom, and cooked on a small electric ring. Joycame over at weekends – she was still studying to be a librarian – and slept onthe floor with me. House-decorating was hardly in my line, but I worked hard atit. Anne was a painter, and all kinds of weird Soho characters drifted in andout.When the proof of The Outsider finally arrived, I went to Cheam to show it toLaura’s parents. Her mother had made no secret of the fact that she thought mean impractical intellectual whose enthuasiasm for ideas would never produce anysolid result. I can still remember reading the proof on the train, and turningagain and again to the title page to assure myself that my name was at last inprint.I now saw more of Angus Wilson, who lived with his boyfriend Tony in DolphinSquare, a block of flats on the Embankment, facing the Thames. Angus was adelightful, kindly man, and his prominent nose and flying mop of white hair madehim a caricaturist’s dream. I knew many people in the Reading Room who enjoyedimitating his fluting high voice. One of them told me how Angus had telephonedan RAF station where he was due to go and lecture, to make sure they could puthim up for the night, and how, when he got there, he found he had been assignedto the WAAF’s quarters.Angus invited Joy and me to lunch at Dolphin Square. We were both overawed bythe fountain in the garden between Angus’s ground-floor flat and the restaurant.It seemed miraculous to be hobnobbing with a published writer. He told usdelightfully malicious stories about Somerset Maugham, mentioning that Maughamwas homosexual, and he dismissed the newly published Fellowship of the Ring as‘don’s whimsy’, and thought that the novels of his next-door neighbour C. P.Snow were a bore.When he told us he knew Stephen Spender I asked him what he thought of Spender’spoetry. ‘I’ve never read it. What I really like about him is that he’s such amarvellous malicious gossip.’Angus asked our advice about leaving the British Museum to become a full-timewriter. If I had known as much about the literary life as I soon came to know Iwould have advised him to stay in the security of the museum at all costs.What I found so pleasant about Angus, although I agree this sounds an odd thingto say, was that he was one of the first genuinely intelligent and culturedpeople I’d ever met. My working-class background meant that I had met very fewreally intelligent people, and although many friends, like Bill and Laura, werehighly intelligent, neither was an obsessive reader, as I was. With Angus, itwas wonderful to be able to refer to anyone from Homer to Sartre, and know hewould understand. It made me wish I had been mixing with people like that all mylife.As I write about Angus I feel a surge of fondness, for he was a kind, generousand genuinely good person. It was not until I saw a television programme afterhis death that I learned the vital key to his personality: his sadisticobsession. It is a sign of my obtuseness that I had not already guessed, forthere are plenty of clues. In Hemlock and After, the hero, the aging novelistBernard Sands, who has developed homosexual tendencies late in life, is sittingin a café in Leicester Square when he witnesses a young man being arrested forsoliciting and, as he sees the terror on the young man’s face, experiences asavage glow of erotic delight. This deeply undermines Sands’s view of himself asa liberal humanist, and initiates his decline. And the story ‘Raspberry Jam’ isabout two sweet old ladies who put out the eyes of a live bird in front of ahorrified small boy. In other works Angus displays a certain morbidpreoccupation with perverse sexuality: in ‘Crazy Crowd’ a brother and sister areglimpsed embracing passionately on a bed; in The Old Men at the Zoo a woman hassex with an Alsatian dog.Clearly, Angus felt like Bernard Sands: he was a decent, humane liberal, yetexperienced these sadistic compulsions. This, he felt, told us a great dealabout the mentality that had given birth to Auschwitz. In 1955 he was planning anovel called The Goat and Compasses, the goat being the devil and the compassesGod (‘God encompasseth’); he was, in his way, as preoccupied with the problem ofevil as Dostoevsky, and his favourite character was Alyosha Karamazov.What would eventually destroy Angus was his love of the literary life and allthat it involved – lectures, chairing committees, foreign travel. Brilliant,intelligent novels like Angus’s do not become best-sellers or attract filmrights, and in her biography of Angus, Margaret Drabble reports that he seldomsold more than 8,000 copies in England, which only represents about £2 a copy.And since it took him several years to write a novel, this kept him close to thepoverty line. In an attempt to economise he moved to a flat in France, but in sodoing cut himself off from his friends and literary roots. By the time he diedin 1991, he was suffering from encephalitis, and his hospital expenses werebeing paid by the Royal Literary Fund.In January 1955, Angus offered to lend me his cottage near Bury St Edmunds, sothat I could finish Ritual undisturbed. Here there was another clue that Ifailed to register. Angus was obviously fascinated by the work of John CowperPowys, who makes no secret of his own sadism in books like his Autobiography andGlastonbury Romance, but at that time I had not read either.I accepted the offer of the cottage gratefully, and cycled there on a windy day,with a portable typewriter, borrowed from Laura del Rivo, on my bike, and theusual library in my haversack. The cottage stood in the middle of a field, andhad no electricity, only gas jets. The day after I arrived it began to snow, andsoon it was difficult to get in or out of the place.I worked hard, and managed to finish Ritual in two weeks, but I was dissatisfiedwith it. This was not the novel I had been trying to write for so many years. Itlacked real narrative flow – for a reason that will be immediately apparent toany novelist. I had written and rewritten it all; some pages had been retyped adozen times. The final manuscript was barely seventy thousand words long, andyet I had probably written half a million words over five years. All this meantthat I could not approach the task with a fresh outlook; I had lost my criticalsense completely about some of the older passages. It was like trying to rebuilda house that you have pulled down twenty times, using a mixture of old and newbricks.However, it was finally finished, and submitted to Gollancz, who declared thathe could not print it. He said the subject – a sadistic sex killer – was badenough, but its unending sordidness had a profoundly depressing effect on him.He told me that he suspected I was not a novelist, and advised me to beginanother philosophical book.Angus’s opinion of the book was more cheering. It had many faults, he said, buthe would certainly recommend Warburg to publish it if I would try to correct itsstructural faults. Warburg agreed to this, and advanced me a badly needed fiftypoundsWhen I returned to Chepstow Villas I discovered, to my disgust, that a lavatoryin full working order had been installed in my room. My books and otherbelongings were strewn all over the floor. Anne explained that the sanitaryinspector had threatened to throw everyone out unless the house had a secondlavatory. I moved all my belongings down to a room on the ground floor, andagreed to pay an extra ten shillings a week for it. On the whole, I doubtwhether it was worth it – any more than the bathroom had been worth a pound –but total lack of interference from my landlady made it worthwhile.The ground-floor room was slightly larger than the bathroom, so Bill Hopkins wasable to move in too. He was working as a night editor on the London edition ofthe New York Times, and was well paid; so I borrowed from him while I waited foradvances.In late March 1956, I was invited to my first literary party. It was given byGwenda David, for the publication of Iris Murdoch’s second novel, The Flightfrom the Enchanter. I met Iris, then in her mid-thirties, and immediately likedher. A round-faced, slightly shy woman, she struck me as rather sexuallyattractive. I recall telling her that my major ambition was to live to be threehundred, as Shaw had suggested in Back to Methuselah. She, in turn, asked mewhether I would like to go to Oxford and take a degree – an idea she brought upseveral times after that. Having too many other things to do, I did not evenconsider it.At the same party I met a writer called Elias Canetti, who lived just across theroad. He was a square-faced man with an ironic, downturned mouth, a bushymoustache and a strong German accent. He and I took to one another immediately;he was one of those urbane, cultivated Europeans, like Alfred Reynolds, and Ifelt certain we were going to be friends.There was also the poet Kathleen Raine, a quiet little middle-aged woman,dressed untidily in grey, with whom I talked about Blake. We had a great deal incommon and might have become close friends if I had not moved out of London sosoon.Gollancz sent me to get my photograph taken for publicity purposes. I wore apolo-neck sweater – I had been wearing them ever since I was in the WesternHospital because I liked the look of them – and it was not a particularly goodphotograph, taken at a shop in the Harrow Road. But it appeared in all theoriginal publicity, until I had better ones taken.This was a pleasant period. I saw many people, spent whole nights talking withBill, and went to a few parties. I worked at odd jobs spasmodically, when thecash shortage became too serious: a few weeks in the Northumberland AvenueCoffee House, and a few weeks for the Students’ Association, making flags fortheir flag day. Joy, also rather broke at this period (she told me that oneevening she had to go without food because she had no money) also took a job asa waitress at another branch of the Coffee House in Kingsway.Two weeks before publication day, I went to another party at Gwenda David’s, andthere met a young, good-looking Scot called James Burns Singer, whose fine blondhair and delicate features gave him a girlish appearance. To my surprise, he hadread The Outsider in proof, and told me he had reviewed it for The TimesLiterary Supplement. He mentioned that he had written an article about theScottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid, and intended to collect his fee from theEncounter office the next day. He invited me to join him and have a drinkafterwards.I met him at eleven, and we went to the office of Encounter in Panton Street,where he got an open cheque for £40, then went to a bank around the corner andcashed it. And as it was nearly midday, he dragged me into the nearest pub, andthere proceeded to drink the money. This carried on through most of theafternoon, although I took care to drink less than he did, and to eat sandwichesto soak up the whisky.Although a poet, Burns Singer claimed he was able to make a great deal of moneyfrom his work. The secret, he said, was simply to write enough. He explained hehad just sold a sequence of a hundred sonnets to a literary magazine calledBottega Oscura, edited by an Italian millionairess, and after his fourth whisky,he proceeded to recite some of them. (I was to note in the coming years thatthis is a habit that seems to be common to Scottish poets.)That evening I had been invited to the flat of Maurice Cowling, one of theeditorial board of a magazine called the Twentieth Century, to discusscontributing to a special issue devoted to young writers. The meeting had beenarranged by Ian Willison, a friend who worked in the British Museum. John Wain,who had achieved celebrity with his first novel, Hurry on Down, was to be there.And since Burns Singer wanted to meet Wain, he came too. But by that time hecould scarcely speak, and before Wain arrived, he had fallen asleep on thesettee, and only grunted when our host tried to wake him.Wain himself struck me as a gruff and aggressive person. He had a belligerentgaze and a tight mouth. He had been at university with Kingsley Amis, but Amis’sLucky Jim had had a far greater success than Wain’s novel, and the two nowregarded themselves as rivals. Wain, like Amis, wrote poetry, but he seemed towant to present himself as a bluff and downright person, on no account to betaken for a poet. Angus Wilson had told me about a debate in which he had takenpart with Wain and J. B. Priestley, in which the two had vied with one anotherin trying to show that each was more plain-spoken and down-to-earth than theother. And at Cowling’s flat, Wain told me that the three writers he admiredmost were Arnold Bennett, George Orwell and the American humorist George Ade.There was an irritable and irascible streak about Wain that I found unlikeable.In due course I left Burns Singer asleep on the settee – he was quite unwakable– and returned home to tell Bill – who had just returned from a stint on the NewYork Times – about my day among London’s literati. (In due course, Burns Singerwould drink himself to death – he was found dead in bed in September 1964.)My expected friendship with Elias Canetti failed to develop. I had read hisnovel Auto-da-Fé, and found it disappointingly negative and depressing. But whenGollancz heard I had met him, he suggested that I ask if he would be willing toreview The Outsider. I accordingly wrote to Canetti, but received a reply fromhis wife, explaining in shocked tones that Mr Canetti never reviewed books, andimplying that I had committed an appalling solecism in asking him. And he and Inever met again. No doubt this was just as well: Peter Conradi’s life of IrisMurdoch makes it clear that Canetti was what we now call something of a ‘controlfreak’. Iris, it seems, had already started an affair with him before that partyat Gwenda’s, and was his mistress for several years. When she became involvedwith him, Canetti made her promise not to have sex with John Bayley, the man sheeventually married.Finally, publication day approached. Gollancz told me that a journalist from theEvening News wanted to interview me, and I cycled around to see DavidWainwright, who had been told about my book by John Connell, the newspaper’sreviewer. David, a quiet, rather shy young man – not at all what I expected fora journalist – was delighted when I told him about Hampstead Heath, and said itwas a ‘natural’ for a story. It seemed that Bill had been right about ‘buildingup the legend’.Saturday May 26 came. Publication day was the following Monday. I saw a noticein one of the evening papers that mentioned that the Observer would carry anarticle ‘Are Men of Genius Outsiders?’ I bought an Evening News, but could seeno review. I took Joy to the cinema that evening, and when we came back Idiscovered that my bicycle had been stolen from outside the house. This seemedinauspicious. That night I woke up and again experienced what I called ‘thevastation feeling’ (Emanuel Swedenborg’s term), a sense of the total absurdityand meaninglessness of life, the possibility that all life is only an escapefrom the horror of death, and that human relations are a temporary deception tomake us forget the horror. It seemed to me that each human being is alone; ourhuman companionship is no more protection than the companionship of sheepagainst the butcher.The next morning Joy and I hurried to the corner of Westbourne Grove and boughtthe two ‘literary’ Sunday newspapers, the Observer and the Sunday Times, thenrushed back home without opening them. I gave Joy the Sunday Times while I readthe Observer.This contained a review by their lead reviewer, Philip Toynbee, comparing me toSartre, and saying that, on the whole, he preferred my style and method.In the Sunday Times, Cyril Connolly described me as ‘a young man of twenty-fourwho has produced one of the most remarkable books I have read for a long time’,and went on to say ‘he has a quick, dry intelligence, a power of logicalanalysis which he applies to those states of consciousness that generally defyit’, and concluded: ‘you should keep an eye on Mr Wilson and hope that hissanity, vitality and typewriter are spared.’At this point someone from the basement came up to congratulate me on my reviewin the Evening News. Incredulously, we searched through it again, and found areview by John Connell with a headline: ‘A MAJOR WRITER, AND HE’S ONLYTWENTY-FOUR’.The man from the basement shouted that I was wanted on the phone. It was afriend, ringing to congratulate me. No sooner had I returned upstairs than itrang again.My unfortunate neighbour’s phone rang steadily for a week. The following day –Monday – an immense pile of letters arrived for me. It seemed that every friendI had ever had had decided to write and congratulate me. Even the headmaster ofmy old secondary school wrote to say how thrilled he had been to read Connolly’squestion ‘Who is Colin Wilson?’I had intended to take the train to Leicester the following day. One of mydaydreams had been to visit a book store called The Midland Educational – inwhich I had spent a great deal of time as a schoolboy – and to look at my bookin the window. But the success of The Outsider made it impossible to leaveLondon.Worse still, I had invited Betty to come and use my room while I was inLeicester: she was hoping to find herself a flat. She arrived on publication day– Monday 28 May 1956 – to find me in the midst of this frantic commotion, beinginterviewed by journalists and called incessantly to the telephone. It was theworst thing that could have happened. She was still my wife, and only a fewweeks before had written to say that she continued to hope we could livetogether again. Now that ‘success’ had arrived, she felt that she ought to besharing it. But I had only lived with Betty for eighteen months, and had beenwith Joy for two and a half years. Was I supposed to tell Joy: ‘I’m sorry, butI’m going back to my wife’? So the exhilaration of overnight success wascontaminated by the sour taste of guilt.Soon after Betty arrived, the Sunday Times rang and asked if I would like to doregular reviewing for them at forty pounds a time. I gasped at the sum. The BBCand Independent Television rang and asked when I would be available to recordprogrammes. On Monday evening, David Wainwright’s article appeared – a fullpage, with the bad photograph in polo-neck sweater. Reporters were arriving at arate of four a day. I had my second expensive restaurant meal with Godfrey Smithof the Sunday Times. Life magazine contacted me to say they wanted to do aprofile with photographs.The BBC organ the Listener carried a review of The Outsider by the doctorKenneth Walker, whose Venture With Ideas had given me my first clear insightinto Gurdjieff’s ideas; it contained a marvellous quote: ‘The most remarkablebook on which the reviewer has ever had to pass judgement.’ I went for a drinkwith Walker – he told me to call him K – in his Harley Street house, and a warmfriendship grew up that lasted until his death.A few days later, a popular tabloid, the Daily Sketch, published a gossipparagraph about me that concentrated mainly on Joy, the ‘little woman’ behindthis ‘midlands D. H. Lawrence’. Betty was infuriated and upset – apparently herrelatives did not know that we were no longer together. And as she left a fewdays later she said angrily: ‘Goodbye – for always!’By a coincidence John Osborne’s play Look Back in Anger had opened at the RoyalCourt theatre the week before. The Sunday Times wrote about the two of us intheir ‘Atticus’ column, and J. B. Priestley wrote an article on us in the NewStatesman. Then The Times used the phrase ‘angry young men’ about us, andsuddenly the newspapers had invented a new cult. It lasted the rest of thesummer, until everybody was sick of it.All this furore was due to the fact that the critics had been complaining foryears that no new generation of writers had appeared since the war. After WorldWar One there had been Joyce, Eliot, Pound, Hemingway, Faulkner, Dos Passos,Wyndham Lewis, Scott Fitzgerald, Aldous Huxley, and half a dozen more. But sinceWorld War Two, there had been no comparable explosion of talent. There had beenAngus Wilson – but he belonged to the same generation as Auden and Spender. Andthere had been, of course, Amis, Wain and Iris Murdoch.And then, suddenly, The Outsider and Look Back in Anger had appeared in the sameweek. That was all the press needed to start talking about a new generation.Now Osborne was, in fact, a special case. A young actor with a natural tendencyto irritation and impatience, he detested his mother, and came to feel much thesame about his wife, who was an actress. He had a natural gift for invective –he once told me that a girl he disliked ‘needed to be fucked by a syphiliticgorilla’ – but a fairly low level of self-control and self-criticism. Joy and Iwere taken by a friend – Dan Farson – to see Look Back in Anger in its secondweek, and I hated it. It seemed to me an outpouring of self-pity and bad temper.Under different circumstances, I think most critics would have dismissed it asmuddled, undisciplined and poorly constructed.But it so happened that a brilliant young critic named Kenneth Tynan, who hadcome down from Oxford and was determined to make a name for himself, saw it asan opportunity to express his own intense dislike of capitalist civilisation.(Tynan was a passionate admirer of Bertold Brecht, and – although he wasdiscreet about this – regarded himself as a Communist revolutionary.) So Tynanchose to praise Look Back in Anger in extravagant terms.Representing the older generation, Harold Hobson, the theatre critic of theSunday Times, said polite things about the play, but made it clear he felt itwas all much ado about nothing. But Tynan’s extravagant praise carried the day.To express reservations about Look Back in Anger was to identify yourself as aboring old reactionary. So most of the critics fell into line, and Osborne foundhimself famous.The Daily Express had approached John Osborne, myself, and an eighteen-year-oldplaywright named Michael Hastings – whose first play had been presented at aclub theatre in Notting Hill – to contribute to a series called ‘Angry YoungMen’ and explain what we were angry about. I wasn’t in the least angry – exceptabout my years of struggle; and now that I was recognised, even this hardlyapplied. But the Express was paying well, so I agreed to write for them – and,of course, helped to establish the ‘Angry Young Man’ myth.I had no idea how much I would come to hate this label."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9> BACKLASHIt sounds wonderful – overnight fame, money, television appearances withcelebrities, literary parties, invitations to lecture at public schools anduniversities … In fact, I soon began to find it bewildering and ratherrepetitive. It all seemed to have nothing to do with me, or with the book I hadwritten.The problem was simple. Ever since my early teens, I had spent most of my timein a world of books. I had been deeply influenced by the spirit of Romanticism –by Goethe, Blake, Shelley, Hoffmann, and by those fin-de-siècle poets that Yeatscalled ‘the tragic generation’ – Yeats himself, Ernest Dowson, Lionel Johnson,James Thompson. The starting point of The Outsider had been why so many men ofgenius in the nineteenth century had committed suicide, like Thomas LovellBeddoes and Van Gogh, or died insane, like Hölderlin and Nietzsche.The answer I had suggested in the book was that these man of genius were toosubjective and romantic, and found themselves unable to cope with the trivialproblems of the everyday world. They wanted to turn their backs on it and devotetheir lives to realising ‘the eternal longing’.But running away was no solution. The urge that drove them was the craving toevolve a more intense form of consciousness. So what was the good of blamingfate and sinking into misery and defeat?I had lived through these problems myself. By the age of sixteen I had beenthoroughly indoctrinated with Romanticism, and had often quoted Yeats’s lines: > … what the world’s million lips are searching for> Must be substantial somewhere …My decision to kill myself with cyanide had been the result of the convictionthat ‘real life’ and its triviality will always prevent us from satisfying ‘theeternal longing’. But what I had seen, as I raised the poison to my lips, wasthat such a solution was absurd. I had realised, obscurely, that I was causingmy own problems by allowing myself to become discouraged. Faced with theprospect of dying in a few seconds, I had realised that the answer lies in ourpower of focusing attention.Imagine a balloon that has been dragged underwater and is held there. It seemsobvious that if the water pressure increases, the balloon gets smaller. Buthuman beings can defy this ‘law of nature’ and increase their own inner pressureby concentration.What does that mean? It means that as soon as we concentrate the attention,something begins to happen inside us; a curious spring of warmth arises from ourdepths, and fills us with that sense of sheer joy that Proust experienced aftertasting the madeleine. ‘I had ceased to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal …’So what had all this silly publicity about ‘Angry Young Men’ got to do with me?I was a hermit by nature, a recluse. Being the author of a best-seller wascertainly better than working in a factory. But I felt just as uncomfortable,just as alienated. Instead of becoming more fulfilled, my life had turned into akind of gossip column.I lectured extensively. One of the first was at the Institute of ContemporaryArts, in Piccadilly. It was pleasant to be able to introduce Joy to StephenSpender, knowing that the last time she had seen him was when he was lecturingto the Literary Society at Trinity. I noticed in the audience the beardedcharacter who had been with Joy at library school in Ealing, and who had spat atme as I rode past. It was also at this meeting that I met Laurie Lee, a manwhose good looks and charm were even then reputed to be irresistible to women.Of course, it was interesting to meet literary celebrities whose books you hadread – Stephen Spender, Christopher Isherwood, Edith Sitwell, Herbert Read,Louis MacNeice – and painters like Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and L. S. Lowry.But I soon felt I had had enough of literary parties.I gave a couple of parties myself, one in honour of Angus’s latest novel,Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, and one for The Outsider. John Osborne came to the latter– I had met him at the Royal Court when its director George Devine had asked methere to think about writing a play for him. John came with his wife, Mary Ure,who had played the wife in Look Back in Anger. Mary got thoroughly drunk onbrandy, and began telling me that John was the greatest English playwright sinceSheridan, and that The Outsider was just an anthology of other people’s ideas. Itook care not to betray my own opinion about Look Back in Anger.My new celebrity brought occasional pleasant surprises. A copy of Groucho Marx’sautobiography Groucho arrived one day from Gollancz, and since I knew VG was nota person to give things away, I wrote to ask him why. He replied that he hadasked Groucho who should be sent free copies, and Groucho had telegraphed back:‘Winston Churchill, Somerset Maugham and Colin Wilson’.I wrote to Groucho to thank him, and mentioned that I was writing a novel basedon Jack the Ripper. Groucho replied with a charming letter in which he said:‘Jack the Ripper was always a hero of mine. Unfortunately, physical limitationshave prevented me from following in his footsteps.’At the Royal Court I met Samuel Beckett, and was tempted to challenge him aboutwhether he really thought life was totally meaningless, but he was obviouslysuch an amiable and unaggressive person that I couldn’t bring myself to do it.But I did challenge another playwright, Eugène Ionesco, about the assumption ofmeaninglessness that seems to underlie his own plays. Ionesco gestured at therain outside the window. ‘Look, the rain is falling – what is the meaning ofthat?’One of my chief problems was the inane publicity I seemed to attract. Oneevening, Joy and I attended a party at Faber and Faber. We had been invited byGeoffrey Faber, whom I came to know and like, and were hoping to meet T. S.Eliot. Eliot failed to appear, but we met William Golding – then virtuallyunknown – and Laurie Lee, also unknown, and the novelist Phyllis Bottome.On our way home – rather the worse for champagne – we passed a theatre off theHaymarket with huge crowds outside. We asked the driver to let us off, andenquired what was happening. It seemed that it was the first night of ArthurMiller’s play A View from the Bridge, and the crowds were hoping to glimpseMarilyn Monroe.When I saw the name of Anthony Quayle on the posters (I had met him at a party)I walked up to the stage door – between two rows of policemen – and asked: ‘MrQuayle’s dressing room?’ ‘Number one,’ said the doorkeeper. ‘Down the corridorand first left.’It was crowded, but we recognised Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh and numerousother celebrities, including Marilyn Monroe, who was standing in front of themirror, trying to heave up a tight strapless dress that had obviously been sewnon, and that was slipping down towards her nipples. Since she was alone, I wentand introduced myself – I had been told that she was bookish – and thenintroduced Joy. Then I went off to say hello to Anthony Quayle. He introduced meto Vivien Leigh and Olivier, and I asked Olivier if it was true that JohnOsborne was writing a play for him. He said it was, and invited me to write onetoo.Vivien Leigh was obviously slightly drunk, and rather flirtatious; when I foundmyself alone with her, I felt embarrassed by the way she gazed into my eyes.When I told her how much I admired her performance as Cleopatra in Shakespeare’splay, which I had seen recently, she said: ‘Come and see me, and we’ll talkabout it.’ It was only much later that I discovered – from a book about her –that at this time she was showing signs of alcoholism and nymphomania, andsometimes went to bed with taxi drivers.I remember little else of that evening, except that a gossip columnist came upto me and asked me what I was doing there. I told him that I had been to a partyhoping to meet T. S. Eliot, and instead had ended up meeting Marilyn Monroe. Thenext day, this item duly appeared in the gossip column, together with thecomment that I intended to write a play for Olivier.This kind of publicity helps to explain why critics like Cyril Connolly andPhilip Toynbee felt increasingly that I was squandering my credentials as aserious writer. The success of The Outsider seemed to cause a great deal of hostility. On apersonal level I often tried to defuse this. After a newspaper interview hadquoted me as saying I would like my name to become a household word, aprovincial journalist wrote to say: ‘You are a household word, Mr Wilson, andthe word is phoney.’ Curious as to whether he had actually read The Outsider, Iwrote back asking him to explain why he thought so. He replied with a longletter, detailing his own disappointments as a writer, and soon we wereexchanging perfectly friendly letters. It made me recognise that there was nopoint in getting upset at hostility, since it usually had nothing to do with me,but was due to some hang-up of the individual.The same kind of thing happened with a writer called Correlli Barnett, who laterbecame a fine military historian. He lauched his career with an amusing butsavage novel called The Hump Organisation, and then attacked myself and BillHopkins in a popular newspaper. I bought and read his novel, thought itexcellent, although I disliked the undertone of cruelty, and wrote to tell himso. He replied with an invitation to dinner somewhere in the stockbroker belt ofSurrey, and proved to be good-looking and charming, with a beautiful wife. Heasked me to call him Bill, and we parted the best of friends. But Bill Hopkinsthoroughly disapproved of this policy of turning the other cheek, and firmlydeclined to meet him or hear any good of him.As the hostile publicity increased, I began to get a sensation that I find hardto describe; it was as if these absurd misunderstandings were somehow ‘fated’.It felt as if I had fallen into a mill race, and was being swept along, unableto get a grip on the bank. I had no underlying doubt that fate meant well by me– my consultations of the I Ching had convinced me that there is no such thingas chance – but in the meantime, some of the bruises made me wince.At a party given by Melvin Lasky, the associate editor of Encounter, I metChristopher Logue again. I was delighted to see him, and shook his hand. ‘Chris,how are you? What are you doing in London?’ To my surprise, he looked at mecoldly and said: ‘Hello, Wilson. My name is Christopher, if you please.’ And forthe next few minutes, our conversation made it clear that he no longer regardedme as a friend. Yet he had been so kind and helpful in Paris that I found thishostility incomprehensible. It was only afterwards that I came to the conclusionthat the succès fou of The Outsider had caused the resentment.Part of the problem was that Logue had become a close friend of Kenneth Tynan,who professed to regard me as a Fascist. And both Logue and Tynan were involvedin an incident that garnered a lot of unpleasant publicity.Stuart Holroyd had written a play called The Tenth Chance, based on the diary ofan RAF pilot who had been shot down and kept in solitary confinement by theNazis. The diary describes how torture and solitude finally led to a religiousconversion.George Devine had offered to give the play a Sunday evening performance at theRoyal Court. Naturally, all Stuart’s friends and supporters came, includingVictor Gollancz and his wife Ruth. Stuart’s ex-wife Anne was there with MichaelHastings, and Stuart was accompanied by a beautiful American girl he had pickedup when he lectured in Oxford. Bill Hopkins was also there, and so was theLeicester playwright David Campton, a friend of my teens.The Tenth Chance was not a good play – religious conversion is not an idealsubject for the theatre. Towards the end of the play, as Peter Moen prays aloud,there was a loud shout of ‘Rubbish!’ and Logue strode up the aisle and went outbanging the door. A few moments later, Kenneth Tynan followed him. As he passedme – I was at the end of a row – I grabbed him by the arm and said: ‘Can’t youcontrol your noisy friends?’ Tynan shook himself free and shouted: ‘G-g-g-getout of my life, Wilson’ (he had a bad stammer). A few minutes later the curtaincame down, but the ending had been spoiled.Outside I saw Gollancz and Ruth, and used some heated language about Tynan andLogue. I felt embarrassed later when I recollected that I had referred to Logueas a fucking bastard. Then Bill and I and Stuart went into the pub next door.Logue and Tynan were sitting there, and I went up to Logue and asked him whetherhe did not consider it a dirty trick to interrupt someone else’s play, and whyhe didn’t write his own. Logue was sitting with his chair tilted on its backlegs. As I was speaking to him, someone hurtled past me and grabbed him by thethroat – it was Stuart’s ex-wife Anne. His chair went over backwards on to thefloor with a crash. For a moment Logue looked up into my face and flinched, andI saw he thought I might kick him in the head.Moments later, the landlord had come out from behind the counter, and the brawlwas over.David Campton’s agent, Jimmy Wax, lived a few hundred yards away in SloaneStreet, and we all adjourned there. Bill asked if he could use the phone. A fewminutes later I made my way to the bathroom, and heard Bill’s voice saying: ‘Isthat the Daily Express? Have you heard about this brawl with the Angry Young Menat the Royal Court? … Well, there was Stuart Holroyd, Colin Wilson, Bill Hopkins…’Bill told me later that he had started by ringing his brother Ted, who worked onthe News Chronicle, then decided he might as well pass it on to the rest ofFleet Street.The next morning, several newspapers carried the story on their front pages:ANGRY YOUNG MEN IN PUB BRAWL. And once again, it did nothing but harm, givingthe impression that we were brash publicity seekers.As I have said, I often felt that Bill was still living in the nineteenthcentury, identifying with Victor Hugo and the famous clash between Romantics andClassicists. But I feel that Bill failed to grasp the difference betweennineteenth-century journalism and its sensation-seeking modern equivalent.The hostility I aroused often seemed out of all proportion to its cause. Oneevening I joined a group of new acquaintances in a restaurant for supper. We hadall been at a party given by Margot Warmesley, the business manager ofEncounter. Opposite me was the novelist Constantine Fitzgibbon. Margot asked memy opinion of Dylan Thomas, and I replied that I disliked most of his workintensely – that it struck me as all sound and no meaning. To my amazementFitzgibbon went purple in the face, and began to shout at me and invite meoutside for a fight. ‘You bloody young upstarts who think you own the worldbecause you’ve had a lot of publicity …’Margot finally calmed him down, but he glowered sullenly at me for the rest ofthe evening. I gathered that he had known Thomas, but this was hardly relevantto my criticism of Thomas’s poetry. (Even now, when I am willing to concede thatThomas was a great poet, I still feel he often elevates sound above meaning.)Two evenings later Fitzgibbon poured a pint of beer over the head of a friend ofmine who was defending me in a Soho pub.This friend, Dan Farson, was to cause me a lot of trouble. I met him for thefirst time in the Soho bookshop owned by a charming and generous homosexualnamed David Archer, a few days before publication of The Outsider. Dan was theson of the travel writer Negley Farson, and was a journalist and an excellentphotographer. He had heard rumours about The Outsider before publication, andsaid he would like to interview me for the Daily Mail. He came to my flat inNotting Hill – by this time I had moved into a room overlooking the back garden– and brought his friend Francis Bacon, who had achieved recognition with hispaintings of Screaming Popes. Dan and Francis were both homosexual masochistswho enjoyed picking up drunken sailors and getting beaten up. Francis, with hishuge round face, looked like a good-tempered farm labourer. Dan went on to writean amusing article about me in a series on modern writers.A few weeks later, when I told him that Joy and I were thinking of taking aholiday in the West Country, he invited us to join him and journalist KennethAllsop. Allsop, who was going to interview Dan’s father, drove us down in anopen-topped sports car. It seemed a marvellously glamorous way of travelling.Negley Farson was an American. He lived, with his wife Eve, in a house on acliff top in North Devon. When we arrived he was sitting outside in thesunlight, wearing only a pair of shorts and a shirt open to the waist. His leg,which had been injured in a flying accident in the First World War, had a gapinghole in the shin. He had a deep, powerful voice and an American accent. Sittingthere in the sunlight he reminded me of Gorky’s description of Tolstoy sittingunder a tree and looking like a nature god.Dan’s mother, Eve, had been a nurse when Negley met her during the war, and wasa model of practical efficiency. After years as a journalist, Negley hadachieved fame in the mid-1930s with an autobiography called The Way of aTransgressor. But celebrity had increased the tendency to alcoholism that he hadpicked up as a newspaper man, so that he had now given up drink entirely –except when he fell off the wagon, and went on drinking until he collapsed in acoma. After that he had to stay in bed for a week.Negley, whose publisher was also Victor Gollancz, already knew about me, and waswarm and friendly. Nothing gave him so much pleasure as to talk about his past,and his meetings with famous men like Roosevelt, Gandhi and Smuts.He told me of how he had gone to interview F. Scott Fitzgerald, and found himstanding upright at a tall writing desk. He asked why Fitzgerald preferred tostand while writing. Fitzgerald said: ‘Because when I sit down I want to dothis’ – pointing at a gin bottle beside the settee. Then he laid down his pen.‘Come on – let’s sit down.’Negley also told me about how he had gone to the morgue to see Dillinger’s body,after the gangster had been shot. The corpse was covered from the waist downwith a sheet. The morgue keeper raised this, and said: ‘Look, he’s well-hung,ain’t he?’Joy and I slept in a ‘chalet’ that they had built for guests, and the followingmorning, Dan produced a new tape recorder, and asked me if he could test it outby doing an interview with me. As a journalist, Dan loved asking provocativequestions, and he soon brought the interview around to the question of my‘genius’. The Sketch, as already noted, had called me ‘a new D. H. Lawrence’,presumably because we were both midlanders and working-class; another tabloidhad even compared me to Plato. But then, I had been telling myself I was agenius since I was a teenager; it was a necessary bulwark againstdiscouragement, as well as being in the best Shavian tradition. Shakespeareobviously had no doubt about his own genius when he wrote that ‘not marble northe gilded monuments of princes/Shall outlive this powerful rhyme’. T. E.Lawrence, on the other hand, had never achieved self-belief, and this waslargely responsible for his destruction.All this I explained to Dan, in answer to his question. But when he blandlyasked me whether there were any other geniuses around, I rose to the bait andanswered: ‘Bill Hopkins.’A few months later, the interview appeared in a new Beaverbrook magazine calledBooks and Art, under the headline: ‘Colin Wilson talks about: MY GENIUS’.This did me no good – nor Bill, for that matter. And the silly interview addedto the increasing groundswell of irritation that was now being directed at the‘Angry Young Men’. Within a few weeks of The Outsider and Look Back in Anger,most of the press stories about us were either satirical or hostile.In all this, Bill Hopkins played something of the part of a Machiavelli. He hadalways admired the combative older generation of writers, from Hugo and Zola toWells and Shaw. He believed, as they did, that a writer ought to be prepared tobe a national influence. He was even more contemptuous than Milton of‘cloistered virtue’; his ideal was a kind of writer–politician, foreshadowed byShaw in Undershaft. One day a female journalist came to see me when Bill waspresent; he joined in the arguments with enthusiasm, and expressed a violentlyanti-feminist point of view. Her article, when it appeared, was scathing; but itquoted all Bill’s opinions as if they were mine, and made no mention of Bill.Bill was surprisingly unenvious of my success; it only filled him withdetermination to join in the battle. He began writing like a steam engine on hisnovel The Divine and the Decay, which was immediately accepted by the publisherHoward Samuel, whose editor-in-chief was a brilliant young self-publicist calledTom Maschler. Tom saw all this publicity about Angry Young Men as a heaven-sentopportunity of stirring up further controversy and making a name for himself inthe process. So he proceeded to organise a book called Declaration, a series ofessays by ‘Angry Young Men’. Of course, there were not enough of us, andKingsley Amis and Iris Murdoch wisely refused to have any part of it. So Tom wasforced to make do with myself, Osborne, Wain, Tynan, Bill Hopkins, StuartHolroyd, film director Lindsay Anderson, and novelist Doris Lessing.Stuart Holroyd had recently published his Emergence from Chaos, which had beenaccepted by Gollancz, who explained on the dust jacket that it had ‘a similarmessage’ to The Outsider, and added – quite inaccurately – that Stuart had notbeen influenced by me. The book had achieved a great deal of attention in thewake of the Angry Young Man mania.But the newspaper critics, who were already regretting their praise of TheOutsider, were determined not to allow another ‘angry’ upstart to achieveovernight celebrity, and one of them even denounced Stuart as a new ‘messiah ofthe milk bars’. Typically, this happened after a long and apparently friendlyinterview.Stuart, like Bill, was a victim of the succès fou of The Outsider. Swept up inthe publicity, they failed to understand that the end result would be abacklash. They also took advantage of the party circuit, and the girls whowanted to share the limelight, so Stuart’s marriage to Anne failed to survive.Stuart had a number of affaires in quick succession with a number of girls,including Carole Ann. The non-stop party atmosphere made me think of the 1920s.My own financial success had been considerable. Gollancz had printed a firstedition of five thousand copies, but this sold out within a few days ofpublication. After that, impression followed impression in quick succession. Thebook went on to sell forty thousand copies in its guinea edition. An Americanpublisher – Houghton Mifflin – accepted it, and published it in September. Timemagazine brought out a full-page interview with me shortly before publication,and the book quickly became a best-seller in America too. Life even photographedme on Hampstead Heath in my sleeping bag, wearing the polo-necked sweater that Ihad become identified with.It was soon after this that I finally met T. S. Eliot. It started when someonein my club – the Dionysus, which was actually the bar of the Mercury Theatre inNotting Hill – told me that Eliot went to church every Sunday morning at StAugustine’s, in Queen’s Gate. My informant – a playwright named Ashley Dukes –added that Eliot was a church warden, which meant that if anyone brawled inchurch, it was his duty to take them by the scruff of the neck and eject them.Joy and I decided to go to church the next morning to see if Eliot would reallybe there.He was. As soon as we went into church, we saw him sitting at the end of a pewat the back, dressed in his neat black suit and a shirt with a starched collar.We went and sat opposite him across the aisle.As the sermon began, there was a loud crash of broken glass that made everyonejump. It came from outside the rear church door facing Queen’s Gardens. A momentlater there was another appalling crash, then another. I had noticed the milkbottles outside this door as we passed it; evidently some urchins had decided tothrow stones at them. Eliot, whose job it was to go and investigate, lookedembarrassed. Finally, when there was another mighty crash, I strode down theaisle, went outside, and caught two scruffy children running away. I said:‘Listen, you little bastards, if you don’t stop this I’ll bang your headstogether,’ and let them go. As I went back to my seat, I got a grateful nod fromEliot.The following week I had to go and see Eliot in his office. I was collaboratingwith the poet Ronald Duncan to get Ezra Pound out of jail, where he had beenincarcerated for treason, and wanted to get Eliot’s signature on a petition. Iwent to Eliot’s office at Faber and Faber, behind Russell Square, and was shownin by his secretary (who later became his wife). I was struck by an umbrella inthe hat stand with the largest handle I have ever seen. Eliot looked much as hehad in church – he always dressed like a business executive. When I said: ‘I sawyou in church last Sunday,’ Eliot said: ‘I know. I recognised you.’ I wasastonished. ‘How?’ ‘No one else would come to church in a polo-neck sweater.’As it happened, Eliot was unable to help us. He explained that he and Pound’slawyer had already set the wheels in motion to try and get the poet released.And a few months later, during the lunch hour, when all the journalists were inthe pub, a judge quietly signed Pound’s release.Negley had an amusing anecdote about Eliot’s wife Valerie. At a dinner party, alittle dog jumped up and began to lick her bare shoulders. Eliot smiled andsaid: ‘I know exactly how he feels.’Another literary pundit I met at this time was C. P. Snow, whose work Angus haddismissed as dull and overrated. I had read a novel by Snow called The New Men,about Cambridge scientists, and thought it was one of the most intelligentnovels I had ever read. Since Snow, like myself, was a ‘Leicester lad’, I wroteto him to tell him how much I liked it. He replied, inviting me to meet him in apub south of Hyde Park for a drink. It was a beautiful day, and we sat outsideon the pavement under a lime tree, and talked about Leicester. Snow, I was gladto note, still had a faint Leicester accent.We took a great liking to one another. And as we separated, he said: ‘Let megive you a piece of advice. You have a likeable, friendly personality. If I wereyou, I’d mix more with people. Go to more parties. Half these people who attackyou would be won over.’He was obviously right, but I was already suffering from what I called ‘peoplepoisoning’ in London, and the thought of more parties made me shudder. But theadvice was typical of Snow; he was known in Whitehall as a master ‘fixer’. Although I was not enjoying the success much, I was at least enjoying havingenough money to live as I liked. This was altogether the pleasantest part of thefurore. I had bought a cheap gramophone (for £10) from Dan Farson, and I couldwalk into the Gate Book Shop, five minutes away from Chepstow Villas, and browsethrough second-hand records and books, then write a cheque for twenty pounds orso to pay for them. I can still recall the gloating delight with which I wouldgo through my new purchases when I got home.I bought a new Encyclopaedia Britannica and the set of Toynbee’s Study ofHistory. What was most pleasant of all was to walk into the delicatessen inPembridge Villas and be able to afford to buy a cold chicken, already cooked,quantities of olives, gherkins, and delicacies wrapped in vine leaves, then geta bottle of burgundy from the wine shop next door, and provide Joy with a coldlunch or supper.It was also pleasant to be able to take her to good Soho restaurants, or to apub opposite Hyde Park, where one could sit on the terrace in the sun and eatexcellent cold lunches and drink beer. For years, I had eaten tinned beans andbread and cheese without a complaint, honestly believing that I was notinterested in food. Now I discovered that I enjoyed good food as much as anygourmet.Joy had got herself a job as a librarian for a naval institute in Surrey. Wewere living together in Chepstow Villas, and she went off to work every morning.Her family thought we were living apart, and she kept a rented room to receiveher mail.Her former fiancé had naturally been devastated by her decision to break it off,particularly since he had gone to Canada to set up a home. He now wrote to herto ask her to meet him in London, and she agreed. I don’t think she enjoyed themeeting: she said he was bitter and angry about being jilted, and she didn’tblame him. I also quite understood and felt sad and guilty about it, althoughJoy had told me that the two of them had grown apart in the two years since theywere at college.Another immense pleasure was getting to know wine in the civilised manner – bydrinking it every day, and trying out every variety in the shop. To begin with,I used to drink a sparkling red Italian wine called Nebiolo d’Asti; later, Idrank mostly Nuits Saint-Georges or other Beaunes.I even allowed myself to be persuaded to join a club, the Savage. Negley hadbeen a member before they threw him out for being persistently drunk anddisorderly; so had Dylan Thomas. I remembered the Savage Club from John Buchan’sThe Thirty-nine Steps – the hero had been a member – and felt rather overawed atthe thought of joining such distinguished company. In fact, the club had beenfounded by the actor Henry Irving, and most of its members were distinctlyraffish actors, musicians or writers, so I felt very much at home there. But Inever quite overcame a feeling of incongruity at walking up its huge marblestaircase, or going to urinate in a toilet the size of a small banqueting hall.This was the pleasant side of success: this, and not having to get up in themornings. Its other aspect was something I would have avoided if I had knownabout it in advance.One evening at the Royal Court Theatre I took part in a debate on the moderntheatre. Kenneth Tynan was the chairman, and others on the panel were ArthurMiller, John Whiting and Wolf Mankowitz. (Marilyn Monroe sat in the front row.)Mankowitz was a novelist who specialised in cockney humour and pathos. Within afew minutes of the start of the discussion, Mankowitz suddenly described TheOutsider as an anthology of quotations. This raised a laugh. Encouraged,Mankowitz kept up this line of attack throughout the evening. The following day,an unsigned report in a London evening paper declared: ‘Mankowitz played withWilson like a good-natured lion with a mouse.’The next day, I was asked to appear on television to argue the point withMankowitz. I did, and the discussion was heated but not downright rude.Afterwards I asked Mankowitz who had written the report in the evening paper; hereddened, then scowled defiantly and snapped: ‘I did.’I was asked to address some kind of a spiritualist society at a Knightsbridgehotel. When I arrived, I discovered they were mostly mild old ladies. A gossipcolumnist from the Daily Express approached me, winked at me, and asked me tocome and have a quiet drink. He intimated that we were fellow-conspirators amonga lot of old tabby cats, and asked me to ‘have a go at the old bitches’. I saidI couldn’t do that – they were my hostesses – but we went on drinking onfriendly terms. In my speech after the meal, I said that I was tired of beingdescribed as a spokesman of the younger generation; I represented no one butmyself. The Outsider was a personal statement, and I felt a fraud when it wastaken to be an expression of a new anti-Establishment attitude.The next day, the Daily Express appeared with a headline: ‘Colin Wilson AdmitsHe Is a Fraud’. I was quoted as saying ‘The Outsider was written with completelyfalse intent …’ Gollancz was immediately on the phone to me, roaring with rage,and two days later his solicitor managed to induce the newspaper to print anapology, but I got the feeling that many people would be only too happy todismiss the book as a fraud.When the Observer published, in its Christmas issue, a page by well-knownwriters stating what they thought to be the most interesting books of the year,The Outsider received only one mention, by Arthur Koestler. It read: ‘Bubble ofthe year: The Outsider. In which a young man discovers that men of genius areprone to Weltschmerz.’The attacks went on. They were provoked by the non-stop barrage of publicity. Myfriend John Rety asked me to write an article for his magazine the IntimateReview, then plastered advertisements for it all over the London Underground, soI found my face staring at me every time I travelled on the tube.This infuriated the serious critics. Angus Wilson asked me to lunch, and told methat the hostility towards me was growing – most people seemed to think I wasorchestrating the publicity. I told him that I had no more notion of how togenerate publicity than a football has of scoring goals. He urged me to get asfar as possible from London, and stay there.And why did I allow myself to become the subject of so much silly publicity? Inretrospect I can see that it was a mixture of innocence and stupidity. I hadbeen unknown all my life, then suddenly, I was a ‘celebrity’. Every time Iappeared on television, or my name appeared in a newspaper, I felt that this wasone more guarantee that I would never again disappear into oblivion. If I hadbeen less naïve, I would have seen that I was simply arousing the kind ofirritation that would rebound on me and invite the devaluation I was so anxiousto escape. I mistook celebrity for fame.What this meant was that, six months after the book’s publication, it was thegeneral opinion among English intellectuals that The Outsider had been a crazethat had died a natural death, and that I should now be returned to theobscurity from which I had accidentally emerged.I subscribed to a press-cutting bureau, but the cuttings were becoming almostuniformly hostile. I got the feeling that every journalist in England wanted tothrow his stone on the cairn that covered my dead reputation. The Americans alsojoined in the fun. No country is more eager to hail celebrity; none moredelighted to see its downfall. At a party in London I had met a fat andpleasant-voiced American called Dwight Macdonald, blessed with an attractivewife and a pretty daughter. We got on excellently. One morning, my presscuttings brought me a copy of a review from the New Yorker that amounted to along and vigorous attack on The Outsider, signed by Dwight Macdonald. I remainedfriendly with Macdonald, but I didn’t like the way his review was taken as asignal for a radical re-estimation of The Outsider by his countrymen.I decided that the answer was to get out of London. A correspondent called HughHeckstall Smith offered me the use of two rooms in his house near Totnes, Devon,and this seemed a reasonable solution. I had never met Heckstall Smith and knewnothing about him, except that he had been the headmaster of Stowe, and hadwritten textbooks on physics for schools. Bill Hopkins decided that he wouldcome with me for a few weeks, and we set off in November.But although Hugh Heckstall Smith turned out to be the soul of amiability, andone of the most interesting and original minds I had encountered, the ideadidn’t work out. Perhaps it was the cold and damp of November; perhaps it wasliving away from Joy – not to mention books and music. After a week or so Billand I returned to London. At least I had managed to get well into SpiritualReformers (the original title of Religion and the Rebel) in a fortnight, andBill had written a chapter of The Divine and the Decay.In retrospect I can see that I should have stayed out of London. What was aboutto happen was the worst piece of publicity so far.In February 1957 Joy went home to Bedford to have her tonsils removed. I went upto see her, and while I was at the hospital her sister Fay picked up a diary Ihad left on the hall table and opened it casually. Some impatient remarks abouther parents aroused her interest, and she read on. There was an entry about ahomosexual friend who had talked to me about his problems, and a great deal ofdiscussion of the sexual deviations that are the main theme of my Ritual in theDark. Altogether, I think she had an interesting half-hour. When I returned Ithought she looked at me oddly, but I paid no attention.When Joy finally returned to Notting Hill, she was exhausted and in tears. Hermother had been pestering her for days, ever since she came out of hospital. Herparents knew by now that I was married, and wanted me to get a divorce, whichBetty was not even prepared to discuss. Joy’s mother wanted me to go to LasVegas. So when Fay happened to ring in the early evening, I told her that if hermother didn’t stop nagging Joy, I would tell Joy to stop going home forweekends.Later that evening – it was Tuesday 19 February 1957 – the storm broke. Joy andI were giving dinner in my flat to a corpulent, plausible old rogue named GeraldHamilton (the original of Isherwood’s Mr Norris in the Berlin novel Mr NorrisChanges Trains). Suddenly, the door burst open, and in strode Joy’s mother,father, brother and sister. Joy’s father was a gentle, grey-haired man, but hermother was dominant and self-assertive. Her brother Neil was, like his father, agentle and rather shy person, but her sister Fay – a dazzlingly pretty girl –was capable of becoming hysterical.I assumed this incursion meant they had discovered I was living with Joy – butthen, Fay had known this for a long time, and even stayed with us. So I couldonly look bewildered.Her father shouted: ‘The game is up, Wilson!’‘What game?’‘We’ve read your filthy diary!’Then at last I began to understand. The notes for Ritual in the Dark included asketch of the Polly Nichols murder site in Whitechapel. Fay must have got theidea that I was at least a sadistic pervert.Her father turned to Joy. ‘Did you know he’s a homosexual and has sixmistresses?’ I am not sure how he reconciled these statements.I took my diary out of a drawer. ‘Here. Take it away and read it.’He snatched it from me and thrust it into his pocket. Then, from his briefcase,he took a horsewhip, and raised it above his head. I pushed him in the chest andhe fell down, whereupon Joy’s mother hurled herself on me, shouting: ‘How dareyou hit an old man?’ and proceeded to belabour me with her umbrella. I tried tosay: ‘But he was going to hit me,’ but it all seemed so funny that I rolled onthe floor, shrieking with laughter. Someone kicked me but I still couldn’t stoplaughing.By this time several other tenants, attracted by the uproar, had come in to seewhat was happening. Joy’s family had grabbed her arms and were dragging her out.I grabbed one of her hands and heaved in the opposite direction. But fouragainst one was too much, and it looked as if they would succeed in dragging heroff. Fortunately, the other tenants helped me to pull until it looked as if Joywas going to come apart down the middle.Finally, I managed to get to the phone in the kitchen, and rang the police.They arrived surprisingly quickly: a sergeant and police constable. Theydemanded to know what it was all about. Joy’s father waved the diary.‘Look, he’s a sexual pervert, and he’s living with our daughter.’The sergeant ignored it. He asked Joy: ‘How old are you?’‘Twenty-three.’He turned to Joy’s parents. ‘Then I’m afraid you’ll have to leave. She’s overtwenty-one.’‘But he’s a pervert!’ said Joy’s father, evidently believing this would lead tomy immediate arrest.‘But this is his residence, and if he asks you to go, I’m afraid you have togo.’He looked sympathetic, as if saying: ‘I agree he looks like a pervert. And if Ihad my way we’d put them all in jail. But I’m afraid that’s the law.’I tried to ease the situation, and asked Joy: ‘Why not go with them, and comeback when you’ve talked it over?’For a moment Joy looked as if she might be persuaded; then I think she wonderedwhether Carole Ann might seize the opportunity to come and console me, and shookher head.Eventually everyone left except the two of us, but even the peace seemedominous.Five minutes later, there was a ring at the doorbell. I went to the kitchenwindow, which overlooked the front door. The two men on the doorstep wereobviously reporters, for one of them carried a flash camera. It was only thenthat I noticed that Gerald Hamilton was no longer with us. I decided to let themin, feeling that a little publicity might keep Joy’s parents at bay. I told themthe story briefly, and allowed them to take a photograph.Ten minutes later, there was another ring at the doorbell. I looked out and sawa crowd of reporters with several cameramen.We rang up Tom Maschler, who lived nearby, and asked him if we could come andstay at his flat. Then we sneaked out of the back door, looking guiltily overour shoulders. But the pressmen had not seen us.Tom put us up overnight, and gave us a chance to discuss the problem quietly.What bothered us most was that Joy’s parents might make another attempt to dragher off, perhaps meeting her on her way back from work. She kept repeating:‘They’re so innocent.’ We decided that it might be best to leave London for afew days. So the next morning we rang Eve Farson, and asked if we could come andstay. We took the next train to Devon.We had rung Bill Hopkins to tell him what had happened, and the next morning hewent out and bought the newspapers. Several of them carried the story – whatmade it irresistible was the touch about the horsewhip. Bill also told us thatone newspaper quoted extracts from the diary that I had handed to Joy’s father,and which he in turn had handed to the Daily Mail reporter.Safely in Devon, we rang Bill again, and learned that the Daily Express wasbidding to publish extracts from the diary. They were offering £50, so I askedNegley’s advice. It was uncompromising: ‘Never sell your private life to anewspaper.’ The result was that Bill told the Express that they could publishthe extracts for nothing, provided he was allowed to choose and edit them. Andthe next day, the Express came out with a double page spread: THE DIARY OF COLINWILSON, with a cartoon of me, in polo-neck sweater, being chased by an angryfather wielding a horsewhip.On another page, there was a drawing by Osbert Lancaster, the famous cartoonist,showing a bespectacled young man in a polo-neck sweater, looking over a banisterat a tweedy-looking lesbian marching upstairs with a horsewhip. He is sayingnervously: ‘I think it’s your mother come to pay us a visit.’I now recognise that fleeing London was the worst thing we could have done. Thestory would otherwise have died a natural death in a day or so. As it was, thepress had a marvellous story about runaway lovers, straight out of Look Back inAnger, and were determined to play it for all it was worth.Within a few hours, a crowd of reporters and cameramen arrived outside Negley’shouse. The phone rang non-stop. And then halfway through the morning, Negleytold me that he had just talked with the Daily Express, and they had an offerfor me. If I would allow them to take just one photograph of the two of ustogether, they would drive us to any place in England and allow us to go.This was too good to refuse, and I agreed. Negley’s house overlooked a longbeach, and his next-door neighbour was a friendly and cultured American. I couldeasily sneak along the beach to his house, and the Express reporters would meetme there. Then we would have to go and collect Joy – she was staying at a pub onExmoor, in case her parents made another attempt to drag her away.The Express reporters met me outside the house of Negley’s neighbour and Iclambered into their car. Behind us, a few hundred yards away, waited thereporters with their cameramen, unaware that their prey was escaping.The senior reporter, Jim Brady, was from Bristol. He and his assistant drove meto Exmoor, where we collected Joy, then we drove off to Taunton station, wherethe photographer took his photograph on a deserted platform. After that, JimBrady went to telephone his editor to report the success of the assignment. Buthe came back looking upset and embarrassed. His editor had told him to stay withus, wherever we went. He was very apologetic about it. He said that if we wouldpromise not to try to escape, they wouldn’t bother us. But if we managed to losehim, it would be more than his job was worth. We promised, and again we climbedinto his car.We had already decided where we wanted to go – Dublin, where Joy had been atuniversity. So Jim drove us to Ilfracombe, where we caught a ferry across toSwansea. I remember that Franck’s Symphony was being played through theloudspeaker as we looked back at the receding Devon coastline. The symphonystill brings back that trip across the Bristol Channel, and the sense ofhappiness and adventure.In Swansea, we found a hotel, then rang Kingsley Amis. Joy and I had met himsoon after The Outsider came out, in that pub in Charing Cross Road near thestatue of Henry Irving, whom Amis typically referred to as ‘old nonsense’. Amiswas a good-looking man, whose voice had a peculiarly pleasant timbre. Dan Farsonhad introduced us, and I had found Amis amusing and likeable. He had alreadypublished a vaguely mocking review of The Outsider in the Spectator, entitled‘The Legion of the Lost’, which began: ‘Here they come – tramp, tramp, tramp –all those characters you thought were discredited, or had never read, or (if youare like me) had never heard of: Barbusse, Sartre, Camus …’Incensed by his remark about T. E. Lawrence: ‘who, whatever his claims as a man,was surely a sonorous fake as a writer’, I had written Amis a rather irritablenote, and received a good-natured reply. But in a letter to Robert Conquest ofJune 1956, Amis quotes my letter to him at some length, and adds: ‘Good stuff,eh? I give him 2 years before paranoia closes over his head.’But we spent a pleasant evening with Amis and his wife Hilly, who was pretty andblonde. It was Hilly’s birthday, and the Amises were sitting on either side of atable full of spirits and liqueurs. (I remember he said he much preferred Irishto Scotch.) When we left, we were both slightly unsteady on our feet.The following day we took the boat from Fishguard to Dun Laoghaire. After we hadsettled in a hotel in Dublin, it was time for work: the reporters insisted ontaking us to Sandymount Strand and taking photographs of us posed on a rock. Itappeared in the Express with a caption ‘Colin and Joy in the south of England’.I have a borrowed portable typewriter on my knee, and Joy is having problemscontrolling her dress, which is lifting in the breeze. (It can be found inSidney Campion’s 1962 book about me, still with the wrong caption.)That evening we wandered around Trinity, then went to the Pearl Bar. There wefell into conversation with a professor of Irish literature named Con Leventhal,who knew about The Outsider. (We had seen a copy on the hotel bookstall as wearrived.) We told him our story, and were soon surrounded by a crowd of literaryIrishmen and being plied with whiskey. Con, it seemed, was an old friend ofSamuel Beckett, and when I said I couldn’t stand Beckett’s dreary pessimism, hesaid that he was nevertheless a delightful man and a marvellous drinkingcompanion.Con invited us for dinner the next day, cooked by his wife Eithne, a doctor. Igot the feeling that Con and Eithne regarded us as incredibly lucky, rather likeScott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and there in Dublin, surrounded by happy drinkers, Imust admit that I felt incredibly lucky. In a pub on the quays we atemagnificent ham sandwiches and drank Guinness, and had salmon in Jammet’srestaurant, in the days when salmon was still an expensive rarity. I found ithard to remember that, only the previous year, I had been struggling to raisethe money for the rent. There was a marvellous feeling that life had suddenlystopped hounding me.A few days later, Joy and I decided to leave Dublin and go to look at the westcoast. By now, the Express was willing to let us go unhindered. Money hadarrived from my bank (care of Con Leventhal), so we took a train to Tipperary,then to Tralee, where we found a pleasant, old-fashioned hotel (as most hotelsin Ireland were in those days). Because of the newspapers, we registered under afalse name – in the 50s, the Irish would have frowned on an unmarried couplesleeping together.In the bar, we made the acquaintance of a pleasant woman in her thirties, towhom we told our story. It seemed she owned a run-down house not far away, inDingle, and she offered to sell it to us at a remarkably low price. Since wewere already thinking seriously about moving out of London, we went to look atit, but decided it would cost too much to repair.The next day she came to our room with a copy of Time magazine. There was aphotograph of myself and Joy, and an account of the ‘horsewhipping’. We decidedto check out of the hotel right away, and caught the next train back to Dublin.But even there, as we sat in an O’Connell Street bar, a stranger leaned acrossto me and said: ‘Why don’t you sue Time magazine?’By the following day we were back in Chepstow Villas. Within hours, the DailyMail learned we were back, and rang up to ask if they could come and interviewme. Joy, who had by now developed a phobia about the press, made sure she wasnot there when they arrived. The photographer set up a camera and took a pictureof me sitting in a battered armchair. When the photograph appeared in thenewspaper it covered the whole back page. There were white circles all over it,and underneath was a key explaining what they referred to: (1) bare floorboards,(2) lamp without lamp shade, (3) armchair missing an arm. And so on.My father was furious. Since The Outsider came out he had basked in his son’scelebrity, and probably boasted too much. Now, suddenly, his friends at theColeman Road club were saying: ‘Why does your son live in such a rat hole?’ Hecared far more about what the newspapers wrote than I did.Gollancz asked me to go around and see him. When I did, he advised me – as AngusWilson had – to get out of London as soon as I could, while I still had a fewshreds of reputation left. He told me that there was an impression that I was apublicity seeker, and that this would undoubtedly draw hostile reviews when Iwrote my next book.I had a hankering to go and live in the Hebrides, which sounded romantic. (WhenI visited them a few years later I was glad I hadn’t – they were too wet.) But afriend who lived in the next room had an interesting alternative to offer. Hewas a poet called Louis Adeane, who worked in London for a publisher, but longedto return to Cornwall, where he rented a farm cottage. For this he paidtwenty-five shillings a week. But he saw no prospect of returning for at leasttwo years. If, in the meantime, I rented the cottage for thirty shillings aweek, it would not only save him rent, but give him a small profit.Joy and I went down to look at it one weekend in early March. We stayed at aboarding house in Mevagissey, run by the poet and critic D. S. Savage. The nextmorning we took a taxi over to the farm, and walked half a mile down a longdirt-track with pools of cow dung.It was a sparkling, bright morning, and when I saw the cottage I could hardlybelieve our luck. It stood at the head of a valley, at the end of which we couldsee the sea. Just below the cottage there was a wooden shed with a desk andbookshelves, and below the shed ran a stream that made a continuous sound likeheavy rain. The cottage was Elizabethan, and was called Old Walls because itswhitewashed walls, about two feet thick, were made of cob. There was noelecricity – only oil lamps – and the stove ran on Calor gas. The lavatory hadto be flushed with buckets of water. But it all looked so beautiful that I beganto worry in case Louis changed his mind. I could see why he was so attached tothe place.We agreed to take it, and paid rent in advance. But before we moved down, we hadto get electricity installed – otherwise there would be no music – which meant agenerator in the shed next door. For hot water we had to keep a stove burning inthe bathroom, but since it was next to the lavatory, it was a pleasure to sitthere reading. Drinking water had to be fetched from a well down the garden.I bought a generator for about a hundred pounds, and a friend named Mike Whyatt– a highly intelligent would-be writer – came down and installed electricwiring. The generator charged a dozen twelve-volt car batteries, and these hadto be recharged every day. A device called a vibrator-pack – which made a loudhum – stepped up the voltage so it would work the record player. There was notelevision, of course, but in those days we had no desire to watch it, sincethere was almost no choice of programmes.That first evening, as I relaxed in my armchair in front of the fire and shareda bottle of hock with Mike Whyatt, I felt that Joy and I had found our paradise."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10> GETTING AWAYIt was probably just as well we decided to move to the country. For at everyLondon party I had attended, I had met attractive girls who were obviouslywilling to have an affaire. Being fairly susceptible and full of romanticism, Iwould have been glad to avail myself of some of these opportunities, but since Iwas now settled with Joy, this was out of the question. My exploits in theCoffee House had made her miserable, and I was determined not to do it again.Ever since I had met Joy, I had been quite certain that she was the girl I hadalways been looking for, my own embodiment of the eternal feminine. But, likeShelley, I felt it was a pity to have to consign the rest of womankind to ‘coldoblivion’.Other writers – like H. G. Wells and Bertrand Russell – had solved the problemby having affairs, and leaving their wives to cope as best they could. I knewfrom gossip that Philip Toynbee, Cyril Connolly and A. J. Ayer kept half a dozenaffairs going at a time. This would have struck me as downright heartless, sinceI adored Joy, and had taken her away from a safe conventional marriage. But Imust admit that being forced to reject the temptation of pretty and compliantgirls was as painful as having an arm amputated. At least living in Cornwallplaced me at arm’s length from temptation.Living in the country was like a wish-fulfilment fantasy. We would wake up tothe sound of the stream, and the sunlight on the opposite hillside (our bedroomfaced west). After breakfast I would walk up to the farm to collect my mail,which was delivered to a shed in the farmyard. But if I saw a brown envelopewith press cuttings, I opened it with a sinking feeling. Almost everythingwritten about me in the British press was now hostile.I was in a strange situation. One year ago, no one had heard of me. Then Ibecame ‘famous’. And now, ten months later, it seemed it had all evaporated likefairy gold. Had it really gone for good? There was no way of telling. Meanwhile,at least it was a lovely spring, and I was 300 miles from London, and Cornwallwas pleasant and peaceful.Most of the pubs were old-fashioned, with horse brasses on the beams and hugeoak settles. The locals were friendly, and I soon got into a habit of playingdarts with them. On the quay you could buy fish and crabs straight out of thesea. Our village, Mevagissey, was so picturesque that it looked like a stageset, and the view from the hill above it was spectacular, with Plymouth almostvisible across the bay to the east and Falmouth to the south-west.We bought an ancient car for £40, and as we were returning from the garage, Joyshowed me the rudiments of using the clutch and the gears. That same afternoon,I drove it for the first time. Joy had gone for a walk to Mevagissey with BillHopkins, and when they were not back by late afternoon, I thought they might begrateful if I drove down to save them the walk. I got into the car and startedit as Joy had shown me – by turning the key and pressing the starter. Then Idepressed the clutch and drove it up the hill as far as the first farm gate.There it stalled because I forgot to put it in neutral. So I started it again,opened the gate, and got it as far as the second farm gate, where I stalled itonce more.Driving down Bodrugan Hill, the steepest in the district, was so hair-raisingthat I wished I had stayed at home. Fortunately I met nothing on the right-anglebend. And I drove unsteadily the two miles to Mevagissey, where Joy and Billstared in disbelief at the sight of me driving down Polkirt Hill towards them.It was a huge relief to let Joy take over, and when we arrived home we opened abottle of wine to celebrate and put Guys and Dolls on the record player.During the next week or so we drove all over Cornwall – Looe, Polperro, StAgnes, Perranporth – eating fish and chips or Cornish pasties, and drinkingbeer. I would work all morning on the sequel to The Outsider (now retitled TheRebel), then we would walk down the valley for a swim, or look at the map anddecide where to drive today. It was like a holiday that went on and on. When Ihad worked in factories or offices, I could not have believed that life could beso pleasant.The Suez crisis had caused a fuel shortage, but our local garage would usuallygive us a fill of petrol. For some reason, the government also decided thatduring the crisis, learner drivers did not need a qualified driver in the car,so I learned fast – so fast that when Stuart Holroyd came to stay with us, I wasable to teach him to drive. When we took him back to London, he drove most ofthe way.However, the old Ford was too rickety for such long journeys, and broke down inHammersmith. A garage told us it would cost more to repair than the car wasworth, so we sold it for scrap, and took the train back to Cornwall, where webought our first new car, a Ford Anglia, on hire purchase.The sales representative, John Cookson, brought a photographer over with him totake a photograph of me taking delivery of my new car, for use in the Ford trademagazine. Then he took us to his favourite pub, the General Wolfe in St Austell,where we were introduced to the small back room where the regulars congregated –the local optician, the ex-Police Superintendent, the fire chief, and variousshop owners. It proved to be a seductively pleasant place, and when they told usthat the pubs were open all day on Fridays because it was a market day, we madea habit of going in on Friday mornings; and while Joy did the shopping, I wouldjoin the crowd in the back room. I seldom drank too much – confining myself tohalves of bitter – although if I allowed myself to be persuaded to move on towhisky, I usually left the worse for wear. I recall one occasion when I fellinto Joy’s flower bed while relieving my bladder. And Joy, instead of beingannoyed, found it all very amusing. But then, I was very seldom drunk, unlikemany of my friends in the back room. One of these, Ralph Goodenough, who hadinherited a shoe shop, often fell down in the street and had to be carried home.I noted again that sense of relaxation and happiness that convivial drinkersshare, the feeling that life is wonderful and will go on being wonderful. Forme, its nearest equivalent was the feeling I used to experience at Christmas asa child, when the whole world seemed transformed into a kind of fairyland. Now,for the first time, I could see why my father had spent most of his leisure inthe Coleman Road club. I could also see why so many writers, from Rabelais to G.K. Chesterton, had elevated drinkers into a kind of mystical brotherhood.My second book, now called Religion and the Rebel (Gollancz finally chose thetitle), came out on 21 October that year. I had prepared myself for a hammering,although I still hoped that some miracle might persuade the critics that I hadsomething worth saying. That hope soon evaporated as I read Philip Toynbee inthe Observer describing it as a rubbish bin, while in the Sunday Times, RaymondMortimer explained that The Outsider had never been much to his taste, so thathe was not surprised to find the sequel disappointing. Without exception, othercritics took a hostile line. And under the headline SCRAMBLED EGGHEAD, Timemagazine lost no time informing American readers that the book had beenuniversally damned.Oddly enough, I experienced a sense of relief. Being ‘famous’ had been no fun atall, even before the press turned hostile. And now I had time to relax and thinkquietly about it all, I could see that, as strange as this sounds, this was whatI wanted. I had tried fame and found it exhausting. And I could see that now Iwas in the ‘fast lane’, it was going to be hard to escape. I wanted to lead thekind of relaxed life that Wordsworth had led in the Lake District. But evenWordsworth had to submit to being lionised and fêted.I had read of literary celebrities who had been killed by success – RossLockridge Jnr, who had written Raintree County, and Thomas Heggan, who hadwritten the play Mr Roberts. Both had committed suicide. They had to think aboutthe next success, and then the one after that. But if that was what successcost, I didn’t want it. I wanted to be allowed to read all the great novels Ihad not read and listen to all the music I wanted to hear, and be allowed tostudy philosophy from morning till night. Like De L’Isle Adam’s Axel, I didn’twant to ‘live’.Then what did I want?To spend my life thinking about the question that really interested me: how totransform my consciousness at will. Wells had expressed it clearly at thebeginning of his Experiment in Autobiography, when he complained that trivialproblems were eating away his life. And he explained: ‘The originativeintellectual worker is not a normal human being and does not desire to lead anormal human life. He wants to lead a supernormal life.’I suddenly grasped the full implications of this a few years later when I wasdriving home from Torquay with Joy and our two sons. I was talking aboutphilosophy, and it suddenly struck me that I was living on two levels at once.The ‘everyday me’ was driving a car – perfectly safely but automatically – whileanother level of me was engaged in ‘originative intellectual work’. My body wasinhabiting the ‘first stream’ of physical existence; my mind was inhabiting asecond stream of ideas and insights. Wells had said: ‘I have no wish to liveunless I can get on with what I consider to be my proper business.’ I could seethat our proper business is this second stream.So now I felt I was off my pedestal and back on solid ground again, I could geton with my real work. The next task was to finish Ritual in the Dark.But first I had agreed to go and lecture in Europe. Before the Religion and theRebel fiasco, I had been invited by the British Council to lecture in Oslo, andat the end of November Joy and I took our first flight in an aeroplane. It was amarvellous experience to see the snow-capped mountains below us. But when weclimbed out of the plane, the cold took my breath away. We were driven to ourhotel – the Continental – through falling snow by the British Councilrepresentative, Brian Swingler, a charming man who looked after us well for thenext six days. At the hotel, I found a woman journalist from Dagsblatter waitingfor me, and was surprised and pleased to be asked serious questions – about myopinion of the existentialism of Sartre and Camus – instead of about my sexlife.For the first time I recognised that I had been born in the wrong country. TheBritish are incurably trivial-minded. And this, I concluded, was because Britainhas been a secure little island for so long. We have not been invaded since1066. So it is simply not in the British temperament to produce a Dostoevsky ora Goethe, or even a Sartre. In England, it is not fashionable to deal with thekind of questions I had written about in The Outsider and Religion and the Rebel– questions about what Reinhold Niebuhr called ‘the nature and destiny of man’.People who do so are regarded as cranks.So it was exciting to be in a country that treated such matters as important.The gloomy Scandinavian winter induces a certain seriousness of temperament,which I found congenial. Our hotel was opposite the theatre, with its statues ofIbsen and Bjørnson, and in discussions with journalists, I felt that literaturewas here a subject for excitement, and that ideas might be a real influence onthe future.On the second evening, a Saturday, I lectured in a vast hall, and the studentssat at tables and drank beer as they listened. Everyone seemed to speak English.When I had finished there was an interval, during which a string quartet playedBrahms and Nielsen. Then question time began – which was completely unlikeanything I had experienced in England. The students went up on to the stage andeach delivered his own short address – if it became too long, the chairman cutthem short, but most of them were remarkably disciplined.What I wanted to explain was why, in an age of pessimism, I was possessed by anabsolutely absurd optimism. I began by speaking about existentialism,particularly Heidegger and Sartre, and explained why their view of humanexistence is so negative. But, I went on, my own experience of the world seemsto contradict this pessimistic attitude. This is not simply because I have anaturally cheerful disposition, but because when I go out on a spring morning,or listen to music, I am clearly conscious of a sense of meaning, which seems tome to be inherent in the universe itself, the product of some externalintelligence, not just a ‘feeling’. Great music and poetry seem to widen myconsciousness in some way, and when that happens, I get a sense that it lets inmore meaning. Sometimes, when overwhelmed with this sense of meaning, I feelalmost afraid to open the gates any wider, in case it floods in and drowns me.That experience leaves me in no doubt that I am seeing something that is reallyout there, in the world itself, not just inside me. This is why I feel the needto create a new form of existentialism that is not limited by pessimism …Many of the students obviously found it hard to share my optimism – but then, tothe young, the world often seems a difficult place because they are full ofself-dissatisfaction. Yet I felt that if I could have stayed there in Oslo,engaging in more discussions like this, most of them would end by agreeing withme.A party that went on until 3 am left us worn-out, and by the next morning a sorethroat had developed into a heavy cold. Stuck in bed in my hotel room, drinkingpotions of hot lemon and aspirin, I read James Jones’s From Here to Eternity(which I had found in a bookshop next door), and was much impressed. ThisAmerican wrote like a master. If I wanted Ritual in the Dark to be equallypowerful, I had to treat it as a story, a narrative, and forget James Joyce andThe Egyptian Book of the Dead. And since the novel was about a sadistic killerbased on Jack the Ripper, it obviously had to be written as a kind of detectivestory.In spite of a sore throat that reduced my voice to a croak, I lectured thatevening at the Anglo-Norse Society, although by the end of the lecture I hadvirtually no voice left. It took another day in bed to restore me to somethinglike normality. A strong Norwegian beer called Julol, brewed only in theChristmas season, proved to be a powerful restorative.Heavy fog closed the airport and kept us in Oslo an extra day. That morning wereceived a telegram from Bill Hopkins, saying that he was going to Hamburg, andasking us to join him. We decided we would. Bill had gone to work on his secondnovel Time of Totality. The Divine and the Decay had been published the day weleft England, and at the airport we had bought a copy of Books and Bookmenbecause Bill had learned there would be a review. There was more – a wholedouble centre page devoted to a long extract from the novel, together with awarm review. I was delighted, and commented to Joy: ‘Well, it looks as thoughBill got through …’It was just as well we decided to break our journey in Hamburg. When the taxidropped us off at the address Bill had given us – his ex-landlady – we foundBill sitting on the doorstep. His publisher had promised to send him a weeklyallowance, but it had not arrived, so he hadn’t eaten for twenty-four hours. Wewere able to lend him money, and we found a small hotel nearby – the HausHeimhude, in the Heimhuderstrasse – and then walked down to the nearest bar. Itwas as freezing cold in Hamburg as in Oslo, and Bill advised us to try the hotrum punch. We did, and found it just what we needed. Then we ate an enormousGerman meal of eisbein and sauerkraut. And as we sat listening to the Germanpopular music that filled the bar, we experienced one of those surges of delightand optimism, and Joy and I decided on the spot that we would remain with Billuntil he returned to London at Christmas, in four weeks’ time.Bill’s girlfriend Gret had not yet sent him any reviews, and I had only seenBooks and Bookmen. The morning after we arrived, Bill came into our room fortea, and told me that I had let the attacks on Religion and the Rebel affect metoo much. It was to be expected in an age when success had become associatedwith film stars and pop stars. No one had had my kind of overnight success sinceByron woke up on the morning he published Childe Harold – and look what they didto Byron …Letters had arrived for him that morning, but he had decided not to open themuntil we got to the café in the Stephansplatz where we intended to breakfast. Onthe way there Bill continued in the same vein. One should be strong enough tolaugh at attacks … As we sat down, he opened a letter, and pulled out some pressclippings. For a moment or two, he read in silence, then his face darkened, hiseyes opened wide, and he suddenly exclaimed, in a voice that startled everyonein the café: ‘The BASTARDS.’ A moment later, he saw our smiles, and joined inthe laughter.But the reviews certainly were not funny. Kenneth Allsop later remarked in TheAngry Decade that in this case the critics seemed to have ignored the tacitlyrecognised rule that an author’s first book should be treated with a certainamount of gentleness. All this was very clearly the result of the ‘England’sOther Genius’ publicity. The critics went in with knives and knuckledusters.But then, The Divine and the Decay was the kind of novel that was bound toinfuriate left-wing critics. It was about a politician who has founded abreakaway right-wing party, and who goes to the island of Sark to give himselfan alibi while his closest political ally is murdered. Bill’s obvious lack ofdisapproval of his Machiavellian hero was bound to cause outrage, and it did.At all events, Hamburg was a good place to take refuge from hostile critics; aforeign city fosters a natural sense of detachment. When I told Bill I wasbeginning Ritual yet again, he had an excellent suggestion: I should open thebook in the Diaghilev exhibition, which I had seen several times. It had beenpresented in semi-dark rooms, to simulate backstage at the ballet, and the scentof Diaghilev’s favourite perfume, Mitsouko, hung in the air. In the exhibition Ihad been particularly impressed by the bust of Nijinsky by Una Troubridge. Now Iwondered why I had not thought of Bill’s suggestion myself.So during the next three weeks we lived in Hamburg, ate breakfast (with lager)at midday in Ribow’s, in the Collenaden, and then Bill and I went back to thepension and worked on our books, while Joy read or did some sightseeing.Sometimes we ate in a students’ restaurant in the Schluterstrasse, and engagedin discussion with students about politics and the divided Germany, whichenraged everyone. Nevertheless, there was a great deal of leftism among thestudents, and many approved of Mao’s ‘Great Leap Forward’ in which the peasantswere organised into communes.Bill had been in Hamburg immediately after the war, when he was doing hisNational Service. It had then been in ruins from the heavy allied bombing, andits lake, the Alster, so full of corpses that the place stank of rotting flesh.The hero of Bill’s Time of Totality was an ex-RAF man, and Bill had wanted toreturn to remind himself of the atmosphere.He took us down the street devoted to brothels, near the Reeperbahn. It had akind of narrow gate at either end, with a notice that declared in English thatit was forbidden to foreign troops (who were then still in Germany). We walked,with Joy between us, past windows in which women sat half-naked, like dummiesdressed in underwear. They resented the presence of other women: some scowled atJoy and one made a rude sign. As to me, I found the situation amusing – thisshy, ultra-respectable accountant’s daughter walking between two men down thestreet of sin.Bill’s first book had already been sold to a German publisher, Rowalt, althoughit was not yet out. Nevertheless, he contacted his publisher, Henry Ledig, acharming and cultured man who took us out on the town accompanied by hisbeautiful girlfriend Paula, wearing an obviously expensive fur wrap.He took us first to a club where we had a drink, and a troupe of pretty girls inBavarian costume performed a folk dance. Then one of the most attractive of themdid a solo dance that we might have seen in the Highlands of Scotland. I waslooking at this delicious creature in her checked dress, and wondering what shewould look like without it when, as if reading my mind, she proceeded to unzipthe back and remove it.She was within a few yards of me, and my heart was beating fast as she went onto cast off her underskirt. Then she came over to me, and asked me to unhook theback of her bra. My fingers were trembling so much that I could scarcely undothe catch. She turned to thank me and I tried not to look at her firm breasts.Finally, she climbed out of her panties and tossed them aside. She was wearing asilver star over her pubis. And I, feeling as if a bomb had exploded underneathme, watched with fascination as she picked up her clothes and danced out toapplause. I took a long drink of my beer, and hoped no one had noticed howshaken I felt.Later, Ledig took us to a nightclub where women wrestled in mud, and wherehorses were brought into a sawdust ring. I protested as Ledig pushed me forward,since I had never been on a horse in my life, but Paula whispered in my ear:‘Grip tight with your knees.’ Joy mounted her horse – but then, she had learnedto ride as a teenager – and I held on tight as the half dozen or so horsestrotted around the ring, wondering if I was going to end up under the horse’sbelly. I had been slightly drunk when I mounted the horse, but by the time I gotoff I was completely sober.Finally, after dinner in another club, we took a taxi back to Heimhuderstrasse,and I slept off too much strong beer.The next morning, Bill woke us up. He had received a phone call from Paula – shehad left her fur behind at our final stop. Could we recall the name of therestaurant? Ledig had gone to the country for the weekend, and she had no way ofcontacting him.Here my curiously associative memory came to the rescue. As I tried to rememberthe name of the restaurant, the only word that came into my head was‘Dostoevsky’. One by one, I ran through the novels of Dostoevsky, and when Icame to The Possessed, a kind of buzzer sounded in my brain. I began to gothrough the characters one by one: Stavrogin, Shatov, Kirilov, PeterVerkhovensky … Then I remembered. The name of the restaurant was Petersomething.Still my memory insisted we had not finished with The Possessed, and I began togo through the names of the minor characters. And when I got to the governor,von Lembke, it suddenly came to me: the name of the restaurant was Peter Lembke.We met Paula, jumped into a taxi, and shouted: ‘Peter Lembke.’ In twentyminutes, Paula had her fur wrap back again.We had meant to stay until the New Year, but a week before Christmas we werebeginning to feel homesick. Joy and I flew back to London just before Christmas.Bill, who disliked flying, travelled by train, and later told us he had had aterrible journey of freezing cold and mishaps.At Old Walls, nothing had changed, except that damp had penetrated the rear walland ruined the covers of my set of Britannica: having taken bookbinding classesat school, I rebound them myself. That night we were awakened by a tremendousbanging noise downstairs, and I rushed down expecting to find burglars. Buteverything looked normal until I opened the vegetable cupboard under the stairsand found that a sack of potatoes had been gnawed open by rats, which had thenplayed football with its contents. We sent for the ‘rodent operator’ (ratcatcher), who discovered that they had entered through a pipe under the sink. Heleft a pile of bran there, and the next morning it had disappeared completely.So the following day he mixed it with arsenic. We had no further trouble fromrats.This episode had an amusing sequel. A few weeks later we noticed an unpleasantsmell in the spare bedroom, but were unable to trace its source – we finallydecided that a rat must have died inside the thick cob walls. One day, KennethAllsop came down to interview me, and stayed in the spare bedroom. The smell hadnow almost vanished, but could be detected if the window was kept closed; so weadvised him to keep it wide open. When his article appeared in the Daily Mail,it referred to my ‘rat infested cottage’. Again, my father was furious as hisworkmates pulled his leg about Old Walls.The solution to the mystery came two years later, after we had left Old Walls.The next tenant removed a huge pile of mattresses from the corner of the sparebedroom, and found the skeleton of a rat near the bottom. It had crawled thereto die, but the mattresses looked so tight-packed that we had never thought ofinvestigating them.My parents came to Cornwall at least twice a year, and my father revelled in it.He loved the countryside, and was a keen fisherman. But he had spent his wholelife working in factories, and I found it poignant that he was enjoying it allas if he had been let out of prison. He was so happy that it was impossible tohold any grudge about the past.There was only one problem: holidays in Cornwall made him deeply dissatisfiedwith Leicester. He loved the sound of seagulls and the noise of the stream belowthe cottage. He loved to get up before anyone else was awake, and light fires inthe kitchen and the sitting room – even in midsummer. Then he went off to fishin the sea, or set traps for rabbits, or helped himself to apples from thefarmer’s orchard. As a young man he had been a swimming champion, but now henever even put on bathing trunks.Joy had by now become reconciled with her parents, and often went home forweekends, but they never came to stay.In 1958, I was invited by the British Council to do a lecture tour of Germanuniversities, and we decided to follow this with a trip down the Rhine, takingmy parents abroad for the first time.We decided to drive, for the pleasure of seeing something of Europe – and alsoto save money by camping. My journal records that I was highly reluctant toleave Old Walls – as a typical Cancer, I become deeply attached to my home. Joyand I crossed to Ostend on 9 July, drove to Bruges and Ghent, and stayed on acamping site in the middle of Ghent. We had bought a double air mattress inLondon, a double sleeping bag, and two nylon and tube camp beds (for my parents,who would be joining us later.)We crossed the Rhine at Aachen, then went on to Bonn, where we met a friend weknew in London, Alphons Hilgers. The next day we went on to Düsseldorf, andcamped on the banks of the Düssel. While we were out at dinner, there was atremendous storm, and we returned to find that our tent had been flattened.Fortunately, our possessions had been under the waterproof car cover, so nothingwas damaged. But the crisis meant that there was no time to go and look at theflat of the Düsseldorf murderer Peter Kürten, the equivalent of London’s Jackthe Riper (and the inspiration of Fritz Lang’s film M), who was also theinspiration for the final version of Ritual in the Dark.We drove on to Winningen, on the Moselle, where we camped on an island in theriver, irritated by midges. The next day we drove down the Rhine, enchanted bythe scenery and by memories of Wagner, and stayed in Heidelberg, at a hotelcalled the Hollander Hof, near the old bridge. We drank beer in an inn thatlooked like a set from The Student Prince, and felt we were back in theeighteenth century.The next day I gave my first lecture. Since I never use notes, I began slowly,feeling my way, before I got into my stride. The literature professor there,Heinrich Walz, was one of those charming and cultivated Germans that I love, andhe admitted to me afterwards that his heart sank during the first five minutesof my talk, thinking it was going to be a disaster, then cheered up as my oldHyde Park training began to take over.In my journal I record that I was dazzled by the attractive girl students, andwas envious of Walz when I learned that he used to be Heidelberg’s best knownrake until a year ago, when he married a girl thirty years his junior. (‘A slimand dark, Charles-Adams-type wife.’) That same afternoon we drove to Neustadt,where I lectured to an audience of teachers, and praised Bill’s novel. Thefollowing day I lectured again in Heidelberg, ‘stunned by delicious littlesweeties who stare with the eyes of bobby-soxers’.This, I must admit, I found disturbing. More than forty years later, I can seethat if I hadn’t had Joy, I would have wasted an appalling amount of timechasing the sexual will o’ the wisp, which leaves nothing behind – not evenexperience.The following day we had lunch with Walz at a restaurant on the top of themountain overlooking Heidelberg, the Königstuhl, and I was again overpowered bya feeling of how incredibly interesting life had become; this, I realised, waswhat I had really wanted before The Outsider came out – not literary parties andgossip columnists.We went on to Besigheim for the weekend to see Irmgard Huckmann, the pretty girlI had taken out when I was at the Western Hospital, and she showed us around theincredibly old walled town, and guided us around a children’s festival atDinkelsbuhl.In Tübingen, we spent much time with a charming Englishman called Peter, anincorrigible flirt with a roving eye for his prettier students. Later, we wentto a party where I record that his wife almost raped me, possibly in revenge forPeter’s interest in a pretty girl named Herlynt. What happened was that while wewere alone, waiting for Peter and Joy to return from driving some guests home,she came over and kissed me, then unzipped my fly and caressed my erection, butshe declined to go any further – as I later told Joy.We went on to Freiburg, where I lectured to large audiences, and read GentlemanPrefer Blondes. I had been hoping to meet Heidegger, but was told that he hadretired to his hut in the mountains.We drove back to Paris, where we found a camp site, and I went into Gallimard’sto see my editor, M. Mascolo – The Outsider had been published in French byGallimard, who had also accepted Religion and the Rebel. The next day Joy and Icalled on Raymond Duncan at his ‘Akademia’ in the rue de Seine, and I wasdelighted to find him completely unchanged – and was also gratified to be ableto present myself to him as a successful author. (A few years later he returnedthe visit, calling unexpectedly at our house in Cornwall with Mme Bertrand.)Two days later I flew back to England – alone – to pick up my mother and fatherand my ten-year-old sister Susan. My father was worried about flying, but allwent well, and Joy met us at Le Bourget – to tell me that our car had beenbroken into. She had been staying with a delightful woman called Odile de Lalain– a friend of Camus’s – who was married to an English businessman called MichaelTweedie, and Joy had made the mistake of leaving the car parked in the streetwith our luggage visible through the window. Fortunately, only a travellingclock had been taken.That afternoon, August 1st, I went to Gallimard’s to meet Albert Camus, whileJoy took the family off to exchange traveller’s cheques and see Paris. Beforeleaving England I had written to Camus to tell him I would be in Paris, and hehad invited me to call at his office, in rue Sebastian-Bottin. Like T. S. Eliot,Camus supplemented his income by working as a publisher.In terms of reputation, Camus was then probably the world’s most successfulwriter, and had received the Nobel Prize the previous year, at the age offorty-four. During the war, he had been in the Resistance, and had edited theResistance newspaper, Combat, so when the war ended, he was treated as a hero.His novel The Plague (1947) sold a quarter of a million copies in France becausethe French saw the plague as a symbol of the German occupation. A young filmcritic once made an impromptu speech in a nightclub in which he said that Camuswas a walking injustice, because he had ‘everything it takes to seduce women, tobe happy, to be famous, and in addition he dares to have all the virtues!Against this injustice we can do nothing.’In view of his reputation as a moralist, I had expected Camus to remind me of T.S. Eliot, so I was surprised to meet an extremely young-looking man. Most of hisphotographs make him appear serious, as if brooding on questions of eternaljustice. In fact, I would have guessed his age to be about thirty, and his browneyes seemed to dance with liveliness and good humour. He had a touch of theurchin about him, as if he was capable of knocking on doors and running away.Unfortunately, he spoke no English, but his French was clear and easy tounderstand. During the afternoon I spent with him, we discussed many subjects,including my own books – he was complimented by my treatment of his ideas in TheOutsider, and said nice things about it.He also told me he intended to write an introduction to Religion and the Rebel,an idea that surprised me, since Camus made no secret of his rejection oforganised religion. But the reason became clearer when he told me about thenovel he was working on. It was to be called The First Man, and was about a manwho begins by rejecting education, morality and religion, but ends up having toconstruct all three for himself.As he explained it, the novel sounded like an interesting extension of the themeof L’Homme Revolté, a critique of the ‘politics of revolt’. The revolutionaryfeels that society wants to tie him in a strait jacket, cramming his head fullof useless facts (education), forcing him to pay constant attention to thewishes of other people (morality), and to accept its notion of what he ought todo with his life (religion). He begins by rejecting all three and livingaccording to his own natural sense of fitness. He feels, for example, that if agirl attracts him, the natural thing to do is to sleep with her, and ignore theparents and relatives who feel he ought to get engaged, then marry her in theproper manner.But even a simple situation like this is set with traps. What if, after sleepingwith her, he wants to move on, and the girl wants him to stay? – a situationCamus often encountered. The natural rebel would ignore her wishes and leave her– and then wonder why it makes him feel like a bastard. At which point, it maystrike him (if he is capable of thinking) that ‘morality’ is not really aninvention of the bourgeoisie; it is inherent in human relations. And if youbecome involved with a group of other people in some mutually advantageousrelation, you soon discover that there is also such a thing as social moralitywhich, when projected into the field of social organisation, becomes politicalmorality.All this struck me as a fascinating and important advance on the position ofL’Étranger and The Myth of Sisyphus. These start from the ‘rebel’ assumptionthat religion and morality are human inventions – lies designed to make us feelcomfortable. From what Camus told me, the hero of The First Man would begin asanother ‘outsider’, like the hero of L’Étranger and end as … as what? Presumablyanother Albert Camus, since the novel was to be basically autobiographical.All this made me aware of the question I really wanted to put to Camus. Wherewas he going now? To me, it looked as if he had reached a kind of dead end, acul-de-sac in which man must make the best of a meaningless universe – althoughI was not rude enough to say so.L’Étranger and The Myth of Sisyphus are basically pessimistic books, whosestarting point is that man finds himself in a world that is empty and futile,and that he must live ‘without appeal’ to religion. Meursault, the hero ofL’Étranger, is condemned to death for a crime he did not commit, and theimplication is that the universe is quite likely to play such tricks on us. Thiscan again be seen in a play, Le Malentendu, which is even more Hardyesque: it isabout peasants who unintentionally murder their son for his money, failing torecognise him when he returns home after years at sea.In The Plague, Camus is still concerned to attack the ‘false assumptions’ ofreligion. But when, I wanted to know, would he stop attacking, and attempt to bemore constructive? It sounded to me as if this is what he was aiming at in TheFirst Man.And at this point I said what I had always wanted to say to him – that my ownconviction was that meaning is a reality that exists outside us. And surely thisis a solution that is hinted at in several places in his own work, where heseems to come close to a kind of mysticism. One occurs in the early essay on thewind at Djemila (in Nuptials), where he explains why he rejects expressions like‘future’, ‘good job’, ‘self-improvement’. All these things, he says, seek todeprive man of ‘the weight of his own life’. ‘But as I watch the great birdsflying heavily through the sky at Djemila, it is precisely a certain weight oflife that I ask for and receive.’ Again, at the end of L’Étranger, after shakinga priest by the throat, Meursault receives a kind of mystical illumination, whenhe becomes reconciled to the indifference of the universe, and recognises that‘I had been happy and I was happy still’. The story ‘The Woman Taken inAdultery’ (in Exile and the Kingdom) again deals with something like a mysticalillumination: a woman who experiences a kind of orgasm as she feels total unitywith the African night. I compared the latter story with the work of D. H.Lawrence, and Camus remarked that I was the first person to see the connectionwith Lawrence; he had, in fact, been thinking of that author when he wrote thetale.But were not these experiences, I asked, in a sense the answer to Meursault’ssense of the absurd – just as Alyosha Karamazov’s mystical illumination, hissense of unity with the stars, is the answer to Ivan’s determination to ‘giveGod back his entrance ticket’?The idea seemed to worry Camus. He gestured out the window, at a Parisian teddyboy slouching along the other side of the street, and said: ‘No, what is goodfor him must be good for me also.’ What he meant was clear enough: that anysolution to this problem of ‘absurdity’ must be a solution that would be validfor the man in the street as well as for mystics and intellectuals.I became excited, and said that this seemed to me to be a mistake. Although aproblem might be comprehensible to the man in the street, this does not meanthat the answer must also be understandable to him. Anybody can understand theproblem implied by the question: ‘Where does the universe end? Does space go onfor ever?’ Einstein’s answer involves such concepts as space-time curvature, andseems to be understood fully only by mathematical physicists. The same thing, Isuspect, may be true of the question of the meaning of human existence. Mysticswho claim to have glimpsed the answer say that it is too simple to be expressedin words. They seem to imply that our basic method of approaching the questionis mistaken. But the basic method is the only thing which seems to make sense tothe ordinary man. So we may well have to begin by forgetting the ordinary man,and thinking in terms of the non-ordinary.Or, to put it as simply as possible: if the answer lies outside the normal rangeof everyday human life, in some paradoxical glimpse of freedom or intensity,then it is no use trying to translate it into terms of normal consciousness. Theresult would be bound to be a complete falsification.To explain this would have been beyond the capacity of my rather limited French:I contented myself with saying that his assertion was equivalent to holding thatEinstein should never have created the theory of relativity, because it wasbeyond the understanding of a Parisian teddy boy. Camus clearly disagreed: hisbasic premise seemed to be that all human beings are in the same boat, and thatone of these days, if God condescends to explain to us what life is all about,we shall all groan with exasperation and say: ‘Of course!’I see from my journal that I spent two hours talking with him, but I have nofurther notes of what we said. I left with a sense of frustration andintellectual deadlock.Although we later exchanged some letters, and he sent me two of his early booksin French, we never met again.One evening more than a year later, my phone rang. A strongly accented voiceidentified itself as a journalist from a French news agency, and told me Camuswas dead. I said: ‘I’m delighted to hear it,’ for I thought it was Bill Hopkinsplaying a joke on me, and trying to convince me that another literary rival wasno longer in the running. (Bill often rang me up pretending to be a Chineselaundry or a Russian agent trying to recruit beautiful girls to the KGB.) Ittook a while to convince me that this call was genuine.Camus had apparently been driving back to Paris with Michel Gallimard, when thecar skidded off the road and hit a tree. If Camus had been wearing a seatbelt hewould have survived; as it was, he was catapulted through the rear window anddied immediately. His death was as ‘absurd’ as anything in his own work.It was not until the American critic Herbert Lottman published a biography ofCamus in 1979 that I understood why Camus was unable to escape this cul-de-sacof pessimism. Yet I had been handed the clues in 1958. When I asked Odile deLalain where Camus lived, she said that he was elusive because he moved fromroom to room. In fact, he was married with children, but was unable to resistthe temptation to take full advantage of the fact that women wanted to flingthemselves at him. So Camus, said Odile, had many affaires.I could understand perfectly. It seemed Camus was a victim of the sexualdelusion that was still costing me a certain amount of self-division. It seemsclear that Camus loved his wife. But, like Wells and Russell, he felt it wouldbe a sheer waste of opportunity to turn down all the admiring females who weredying to share his bed. Wells’s wife did her best to put up with it, convincedby her fast-talking mate that sexual freedom was everyone’s birthright. But shewilted away and, after her death, Wells was racked with conscience.But Camus set himself up as some kind of a moralist; the question is fundamentalto his work. His wife was an eminently good and intelligent woman ofconsiderable character. There can be no doubt that the moralist in him told himto treat his wife as she deserved. The satyr contented itself with an occasionalinsincere prayer: ‘O Lord, make me good – but not yet.’ This, I think, explainswhy Camus regarded himself as a kind of ‘lightweight’, a kind of fake.This becomes clear in the novel that won him the Nobel Prize, The Fall, which isabout a lawyer who regards himself as a generous and altruistic individual untilhe begins to see through his own self-complacency. His relations with women inparticular fill him with guilt, for he is a highly successful Don Juan.Self-knowledge finally drives him to abandon his flourishing practice, andbecome a kind of penitent in a run-down quarter of Amsterdam.As far as Camus’s peace of mind went, the Nobel Prize was in some ways the worstthing that could have happened to him. All those who felt he had been far toosuccessful turned on him. Even the visit to Stockholm for the Nobel Prize wasmarred by attacks from political militants who implied that Camus was ahypocrite. When he heard the news that he had won the award, Camus declared: ‘Iam castrated.’ And, in effect, this turned out to be true."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11> JOHN BRAINE IN LENINGRADThe poet Louis Adeane, from whom we rented Old Walls, had hinted that he mightwant to return in 1959. Early that year we wrote to ask him exactly when hewanted to move back to Cornwall, but he was too lazy to reply. So in February,while I worked hard on Ritual in the Dark, Joy went off looking for a house. Shesaw one advertised in the next village, Gorran Haven, but the price was high –£4,900. (Most properties around here could be had for £2,500.) It proved to beup a long private drive – in fact, a muddy dirt track – and when she peered atit from the entrance, decided it was far too big for us. But just as she wasabout to leave, she saw someone looking at her out of the window, and felt itwould be bad manners to go away. She knocked on the door, and was invited insidefor a cup of tea.When she came home she told me it was too expensive and too big. I said: ‘Good –lots of room for books and records.’ So we drove over to see it.It had been built six years earlier by a couple named Davis. They came fromBrighton, and had intended to run the place as a market garden – it had twoacres of land. But Mrs Davis had become homesick for old friends, and wanted toreturn to Brighton.The house was called Tetherdown, which we decided to change. But thinking ofsomething better was more difficult than we thought, so we ended by keeping thename. The long lane – five hundred yards of it – was certainly impressive. Thehouse itself was less so, being a bungalow built of Cornish blocks – largehollow blocks cast in concrete – and painted a greenish colour with waterproofcement paint. There was a huge greenhouse, about twenty yards long, and a largeback garden. The rest of the two acres was uncultivated field. But its frontwindows had an enormous view of the sea. I decided that if we could raise themoney, we would take it.It seemed to me that it would be an excellent idea to ask my mother and father(and sister Sue) to come and live with us. My father had loved his holidays atOld Walls, and was always saying that he wished he lived in the country. Hecould carry on Mr Davis’s market garden, growing tomatoes in the greenhouse. Andin the garden below the house there was a small two-room ‘chalet’ which theDavises had rented to summer visitors. Dad could also take on the task ofmaintaining this, and collect the rent for pocket money.The legal formalities all took far longer than expected. My family moved down toOld Walls in early April 1959, but it was mid-May before we were able to move.On my father, the effect of this long wait was disastrous. Having worked all hislife, he was in the habit of regarding every day either as a working day or aholiday. That long wait allowed him to slip into the insidious habit of thinkingof life in Cornwall as a holiday. Since he had always spent most of his sparetime in the pub, he quickly reverted to habit.He would get up – as usual – at seven in the morning, light two huge fires, thengo off fishing. He was back home by eleven, and wanted to be taken to the pub,either in Gorran or in Mevagissey. (In those days there was no pub in GorranHaven.) At two o’clock he needed to be picked up again. He dozed in theafternoon, then started glancing at the clock towards opening time. He liked meto go and join him, but I soon became bored with wasting my evenings drinkingbeer and playing darts, and began to make excuses. So at ten o’clock, he neededto be fetched from the pub again.We had very little money. In order to buy furniture we had raised a secondmortgage on the house. Gollancz had finally accepted Ritual in the Dark (FredWarburg had dropped out of the running a long time ago), and given me an advanceof £500. And I told my American agent to try to persuade my publisher there –Houghton Mifflin – to give me an advance of $5,000 – a large amount for me (theyhad paid $1,500 on my previous books). It was a huge relief when they agreed,for we were up to our overdraft limit.All the same, it was wonderful to be in our own home – to be able to have a bathby turning on the hot tap instead of having to light a fire under a boiler. Butevery time I took a bath I wondered how long we would be able to afford to livehere, with two £125 mortgage payments a year. (Our income was about £140 a week,but it came in piecemeal.)My father’s boredom and dissatisfaction made things worse. When the summer wasover, and visitors had stopped renting the chalet, he suggested that he and mymother should move in there, and that she should cook for the two of them. Hewanted to be able to return from the pub at any hour and expect a meal. Mymother understandably objected; she preferred living in the house and eating hermeals with us. Finally, when they had lived in Cornwall for six months, sheannounced she was going back to Leicester. She said that if my father continuedto spend his days in the pub, he would drink himself to death. They returned inlate November 1959. I was sad to see my parents go, but must admit that it was arelief to have the house to ourselves.Dad, of course, had to return to work in a factory. And although he had becomefrustrated and dissatisfied with Cornwall, he hated Leicester even more. Isuspect that his frustration was the cause of the cancer that eventually killedhim.That spring, Joy had an accident that made me suddenly aware of the strength ofmy feeling about her. We were returning to Old Walls, and Joy got out of theLand-Rover and went to open the gate. There were a number of cows waiting toreturn from milking, but Joy was used to cows, and pushed her way through.Suddenly I was aware of one of the cows charging at her, and butting her againstthe stone gatepost. As I watched, she sank to the ground, and the cow went ontrying to get its horn into her.I jumped out of the Land-Rover, ran up to the cow, and pounded its ribs,shrieking curses. It backed away, and I picked Joy up – she was very light – andcarried her back to the car. The cow had taken a chip out of the flesh on hernose and the blood was running down her face.I got her back home and into bed, then called the doctor. He came quickly,examined her, and concluded that she had a broken rib (in fact, there were two).But there was nothing he could do – putting the ribs in plaster would cause hermore trouble than it was worth. She simply had to stay in bed, and make sure shedid no heavy lifting.As Joy lay there, with the piece out of her nose, I was suddenly aware of howmuch I loved her. This may sound surprising; but Joy had always been a rathercool and detached girl, who never expressed strong feeling, so I had neverreally felt close to her. She had always seemed oddly ‘non-reactive’. This waswhy I had never felt guilty about Carole Ann or Dorothy. But seeing her likethis made me feel intensely protective, and it was as if some invisible obstaclebetween us disappeared, and allowed me to feel close to her, as I had towards mybrother Barry, and as I now do towards my children.The cow, we discovered, was suffering from milk fever, and died a few dayslater.In January, Joy announced that she was pregnant. I recall that I was filling ina crack in the ceiling at the time, and playing a record of Shostakovich’s newlyissued fourth symphony. My reaction was less ecstatic than it might have been. Ihad already tried being a father once, and had not particularly enjoyed theexperience. But at twenty-eight, Joy obviously felt it was time she had a baby.In late February 1960, Ritual in the Dark was finally published, and EdithSitwell launched it with an excellent review in the Sunday Times, although KarlMiller, an old enemy, gave it a vicious review in the Observer in which hereferred to ‘the odious Outsider’. It appeared in America at the same time, anddid almost as well as The Outsider, selling around 25,000 copies. I felt thatthe eleven years I had spent on it had been worthwhile. And Robert Pitman, afriend who was a book critic on the Sunday Express, gave it an admirable review,in which he said: ‘Not since Dickens had anyone dealt with murder in a novel ofthis size and seriousness.’We had met Robert Pitman through the novelist John Braine. And since Braine willplay a central part in the events that follow, this is the place to say moreabout him.Room at the Top appeared in March 1957, and a review by John Metcalfe in theSunday Times launched it with the comment: ‘Remember the name. John Braine.You’ll be hearing quite a lot about him.’ But the reviews made me feel it wasnot my kind of book. The hero, Joe Lampton, was described as a ruthlessgo-getter who tramples on other people’s faces to get to the top – not the kindof person I wanted to read about. But a year later I saw a second-hand book-clubedition and bought it. It was probably another six months before I opened it.But when I did get around to it, I read on with fascination until I got to theend. It struck me as very nearly a great novel.It was quite obvious the critics had got it wrong. This was not a novel about aheartless social climber, but about a romantic young Yorkshireman who takes ajob in a strange town, far less grimy and depressing than his own, and knowsfrom the moment he arrives that he is going to enjoy it. So the book had asparkling atmosphere of expectation that made it a delight to read. When thehero joins the local drama group, and is attracted to the mill-owner’s prettydaughter, he doesn’t feel he stands a chance with a well-educated middle-classgirl. So the reader enjoys Joe’s pursuit of her – and ultimate success – as muchas Joe does himself. (Perhaps I enjoyed it so much because it reminded me of myown pursuit of Joy.)The novel was completely free from the cynicism I expected – on the contrary ithas an atmosphere rather like a fairy story. Moreover, there was an honestyabout it that reminded me of Hemingway. I felt a twinge of the kind of anxietythat I had never experienced reading Amis or Wain or Sillitoe: that this manmight be a real contender for the literary heavyweight title.I wrote to Braine, care of his publisher, telling him how much I admired thebook, and received an amiable reply. And in October 1958, Joy and I drove up toBingley to meet him.The man who came to open the door was not in the least like Hemingway. Idescribed him in my journal as ‘a beefy man with a large tummy, horn rimmedspecs, a strong Yorkshire accent – giving the impression of being bear-like,slow-thinking (though by no means thick-witted) and good tempered.’ Nine yearsmy senior, he made me think of an overgrown schoolboy, swaying back and forthfrom heel to toe as he talked in the centre of the rug, with his hands claspedin front of him.His wife Pat was an attractive, slim girl with a lovely transparent complexion.She had been a schoolteacher when they married.Before dinner, Braine took me to the local pub in his small car. He was alearner driver, and the ride was hair-raising. He kept apologising for being abad driver, and I would politely reassure him, then have to bite back a gasp ofalarm as he took a corner too fast or missed another car by inches. There wassomething endearingly incompetent about him. When we came out of the pub – wherehe was treated as the local celebrity – he dropped his car key among a pile ofautumn leaves, and we had to switch on the headlights, and crawl on all fourssearching for it.Again, I made the mistake of reassuring him about his driving. ‘Tell you what,’John said brightly, ‘I’ll just take you on a little run up to the edge of themoor.’ And we hurtled along a narrow road between stone walls, occasionallyplunging into darkness as he switched off the headlights in an attempt to dipthem. When I staggered out of the car half an hour later, I was nervouslyexhausted.John enjoyed playing the bluff Yorkshireman, and referring to himself as‘t’Master’. It was obvious that he was basically a shy and sensitive person whohad taught himself to present a bold face to the world by laying down the law.‘Truman’s a bluddy murderer!’ he pronounced, on the subject of the atom bomb,and glared aggressively round the table. Predictably, no one contradicted him,feeling that a person of such strong convictions deserved respect – which, Icame to feel, was part of his method.When Joy and I were about to go to bed, John winked and said: ‘By the way,there’s no sex allowed here. We try to run a decent house.’The next day, while he was driving us on a tour of the area, he told us how Roomat the Top had come to be written. A few years earlier, John had been in anamateur dramatic society, and had met a beautiful young girl – the model forSusan Brown. John could hardly believe it when she made it clear that she foundhim attractive. She had an odd masochistic streak and, when John took hervirginity, was obviously excited by the pain, and even fascinated by the sightof blood on her thighs.Enraptured by this enchanting embodiment of femininity, John felt the need to besomething more than a local librarian. He had had some articles accepted byTribune and the New Statesman, so now decided to go to London and become awriter. But his £150 in savings soon ran out, and the occasional piece for theNew Statesman would not even pay the rent of his bedsit. When a bout oflaryngitis turned into tuberculosis, he went back to Yorkshire (he told me hewas ‘shipped back on the train’) and into a sanatorium. During the eighteenmonths he spent there, the girl he adored broke off the relationship and marriedsomeone of ‘her own class’. John was shattered, but finally wrote it out of hissystem in Room at the Top.The novel was a commercial success, and was made into one of the best Britishfilms of the 50s. Unfortunately, the film rights had been sold beforepublication for a mere £5,000. The Penguin paperback went on to sell a millioncopies, but since John received only about a penny a copy, the royalties came toless than £5,000.Typically, when he was invited on to the film set to meet the cast, John made aspeech, telling them: ‘Do you realise you’re all figments of my imagination?’The following year, when Joy and I had moved into the house in Gorran Haven,John and Pat came to stay with us, with their small son Anthony. (John insistedon pronouncing the ‘th’ as in ‘thorough’.) When a bat flew in through our windowat dusk, John went berserk, assuring us that if it bit Anthony, he would die ofblood poisoning.He also spent much of the week in Cornwall sighing and complaining about anarticle he had to write for a Sunday newspaper, on the theme of the ‘wet hero’who is so prominent in modern fiction, his groans implying that he faced a majorcreative task on a level with Room at the Top. But it was also typical of hisstyle that, as I was about to drive him to the station, he flourished my copy ofBrendan Behan’s Borstal Boy and said: ‘I’ll take this’ (not ‘May I borrowthis?’). Later he admitted, also without apology, that he had somehow lost itout of the window of the railway carriage.Interestingly enough, one of the writers he admired most was John O’Hara, whoshared his obsession with social distinctions and class symbols like expensivecars and girls with a Riviera suntan. At that time I think John’s ambition wasto become a kind of British O’Hara, carefully researching the social andhistorical backgrounds of his characters, and producing vast documentary novels.When we first met him, he told us that his next major project was going to be anovel about Bradford, and about the whole ‘missing generation’ of young men whowere killed in the First World War. But John somehow lacked that kind of talent.Unlike J. B. Priestley, whom he also admired enormously, he had no ability tocreate large canvases or larger-than-life characters. His own work wasessentially personal and autobiographical.A few months after his visit to Cornwall, Braine, Stuart Holroyd and I came toan agreement to share the rent of a room in the house where Bill lived, at 25Chepstow Road (just around the corner from my former address at ChepstowVillas). It was owned by Peter Rachman, a notorious slum landlord of the time,whose name was later associated with the Christine Keeler scandal. We wereallowed to live there for a minimal rent (about £5 a week) because so long asthe house had a few ‘respectable’ tenants, the police could not close it down asa brothel. But it was often hard to sleep, for car doors slammed all night asclients came and went. The lady who lived on the ground floor, opposite the onlylavatory, had a clothes line strung outside the door, on which dangled a mostamazing array of brightly coloured panties – red, purple, green and brightyellow.In a large room on the third floor lived Tom Greenwell, a gossip columnist onthe Evening News, and one of the kindest and most good-tempered men I have everknown. He was tall, thin and elegant, sported fancy waistcoats and bow ties, andspent his evenings at first nights and cocktail parties. Tom seldom came homebefore three in the morning, and when he did, he usually found his room crowdedwith friends like Bill, Stuart, Braine, myself, and various attractive youngladies who had become groupies of this Notting Hill branch of the ‘Angry YoungMen’. If he was tired or dismayed, he never showed it.I have to confess that I often felt a certain envy of Bill, Stuart and Tom,since they were free to take advantage of the pretty groupies, while John Braineand I were married and therefore out of the running. But then, a week in Londonalways left me exhausted and suffering from ‘people poisoning’. I always heaveda sigh of relief when I was back in my secure retreat in Cornwall.When John Braine introduced me to Robert Pitman of the Sunday Express, Iestablished an immediate rapport with his wife, Pat, because she was asinterested in murder as I was. And it was this shared interest that led us todecide to compile an encyclopedia of murder – something that no one had so farattempted.This came about because Dan Farson had invited various friends to his flatoverlooking the river in Limehouse. These included Pat and Bob Pitman, Joy, theAmerican ‘Beat’ poet Gregory Corso, the playwright Frank Norman, and one ofDan’s beefy young men. I was talking to someone about the Crippen murder case,and could not remember where he lived. I called to Pat – in the next room –‘What was Crippen’s address?’ and she called back instantly: ‘Thirty-nineHilldrop Crescent.’ It was in that moment that I decided that Pat would make anideal collaborator.I should explain that Dan had now achieved fame as a television celebrity, andthat I was partly responsible. In 1956 he had applied to Associated Rediffusionfor a job, and they asked him who he knew. He mentioned Francis Bacon andmyself. They told him that he could have the job if he could get me to do aninterview. I, of course, agreed, and Dan arrived at my room with a camera crew.I was just finishing a meal, and as we talked, I picked up a pear and bit intoit. When the show was broadcast this exhibition of sangfroid created widespreadcomment, most of it hostile, and Dan went on to become a television interviewer,specialising in asking brutal and probing questions. He became so successfulthat he bought himself a pub on the Isle of Dogs.Dan’s downfall would come about, as he himself admitted to me, through hubris.His popularity was enormous, and he felt that he was not being given enoughcreative freedom. So he resigned, convinced that they would lose no time inconceding his demands. But they didn’t – possibly, as he admits in hisautobiography, because of his heavy drinking and bizarre sex life – and Danbecame a freelance interviewer and writer, never regaining his former position.The pub on the Isle of Dogs went bankrupt, probably because Dan gave away toomany free drinks. In any case, being a pub landlord was the worst possibleoccupation for someone of his temperament, since he was already as confirmed analcoholic as his father.Negley himself was dead by that time. On 13 December 1960, his bags packed foranother journey, he pointed at the breaking surf, and said to Eve: ‘This is theperfect place for a journey’s end.’ Then he sat in his armchair and diedquietly.Eve was shattered. After being married to such a dynamo, she found life withouthim intolerable. She drove down to stay with us for a weekend, and when Ioffered to play her a tape I had made of Negley, said: ‘No don’t – I couldn’tbear it.’ And that same evening she commented: ‘I don’t care how soon I die –the sooner the better.’ I shook my head and warned her that that kind ofpronouncement was tempting fate, and she said: ‘I don’t care.’ But when, on herway home, her car broke down in Launceston and she had to spend the night in ahotel, I had a feeling that she had brought it on herself.Not long after that, she tripped at the top of a flight of stairs after lunchwith a friend, and broke her neck.My visit to Dan’s Limehouse flat was the beginning of a year-long collaborationwith Pat on the Encyclopedia of Murder. I offered the book to Victor Gollancz,but he turned it down, explaining that he had once published a novel thatdescribed a particularly subtle method of murder, and that subsequently someonehad copied it in real life. Apparently the suspicions of the police were arousedby a copy of the book in the killer’s room.So I offered the Encyclopedia to the publisher George Weidenfeld, whom I met ata party, and he accepted it.Pat and I began by making a list of famous murder cases and dividing them upbetween us. In general, Pat preferred domestic crimes and poisoning cases, whileI dealt with mass murderers and sex crimes.In the spring Bob Pitman suggested that Joy and I should join him on a trip toLeningrad. A new Russian boat called the Bore II was sailing from Tilbury, andthe fare was absurdly low. So although Joy was now seven and a half monthspregnant, we joined the rest of the party – which included Pat, theirten-year-old son Jonathan, and John Braine – on 6 July 1960.I had not seen John for some time, but Bob had told me that he was drinking fartoo heavily. After Room at the Top, he had written a novel called The Vodi, inwhich he continued the story of the unhappy love affair that had made him writeRoom at the Top. The hero is in a nursing home suffering from tuberculosis, andsuspects that the girl he is engaged to is getting tired of him. The Vodi of thetitle are unpleasant little creatures whose purpose is to see that the good failand the wicked succeed, and the hero invents a fantasy in which they areresponsible for all his misfortunes.It was not a good novel. I had read it in typescript with a sinking heart,wondering how the author of Room at the Top had convinced himself that thisdepressing rubbish, with its thoroughly ‘wet’ hero, was worth writing. Thereviews, predictably, had been unenthusiastic and the sales poor. I was notsurprised that John was drinking too much.But when we met at Tilbury, I thought he looked cheerful enough. He told us thathis doctor, who was also his best friend, had warned him that unless he stoppeddrinking he would ruin his liver. So John was now on the wagon. Pat was stayingat home to look after Anthony.The Russian ship smelled of fresh paint and the pungent pink soap in thetoilets. On the wall opposite the gangplank was a cartoon-like painting of arocket heading for the moon – the Russians had recently taken the lead in thespace race. Bob and I made our way to the bar, and ordered vodka. It was verycheap, and smelled and tasted quite different from the vodka we drank inEngland, having a curious oily flavour that reminded me of the taste that comesup in your throat when you have heartburn. But after two or three you got usedto it and noticed only the warm glow.John came and joined us and stuck to lemonade, preaching the virtues ofabstinence. As always when he was sober, he was serious and subdued. He told ushe was thinking of writing a sequel to Room at the Top, but at the moment had noideas about a plot.Dinner was filling, but was certainly not haute cuisine – red cabbage, potatoes,well-cooked meat and dumplings. We ordered red wine with it, and weredisconcerted when it proved to be sweet. The Russians, apparently, preferredtheir wine sweet – even their champagne.That night the sea was rough, and the boat surged crazily up and down. Atbreakfast the next morning, Joy and I were almost alone in the dining room. Joyrecalls that we were given porridge with a layer of floating butter on it. Ihave always been a good sailor, perhaps because I used to bite my nails; I havebeen told that nail-biters are not prone to sea-sickness.My problem was that travel bored me. As soon as we landed in a city likeCopenhagen or Stockholm, I made straight for the nearest bookshop – they all hada good selection of American paperbacks. It was in Stockholm that I discoveredFriedrich Dürrenmatt through his novel The Pledge, and decided that he was oneof the best writers of his generation.I finally became so indifferent to the sight of foreign cities that when therest of the party went ashore at Gdansk, in Poland, I stayed on board readingthe Faber volume Best SF.John stuck to his vow of teetotalism until we went ashore in Stockholm. There westopped at a café at mid-morning and drank some of the local schnapps. Johndecided to allow himself just one, but after the first, drank two or three more.It was then I saw that John had become a genuine alcoholic – after drinking justone glass, he had to carry on until he was incapable of standing up. We wentback on to the boat for lunch, and he had vodka. Then he came along to my cabin,and asked me if I had anything to drink. In fact, he knew I had, since he hadseen me buy a bottle of cherry brandy that morning. John then sat and drank allof it. He did not appear for supper that evening.The result was that during the rest of the trip he became the noisy andself-assertive drunk that I had often seen in Notting Hill, laying down the lawand talking obsessively. When John was drunk, the Yorkshire accent would becomestronger, and he enjoyed saying: ‘Now you listen to me …’ wagging his finger orstriking the table.In this state, he was suddenly possessed with a desire to show you how much heknew about everything, particularly material goods. Room at the Top is full ofacute observation of wealth-symbols: expensive cars, Rolex watches, Savile Rowsuits. He was capable of saying, at two o’clock in the morning, when everyonewas yawning: ‘Have you ever thought about kitchen stoves?’ (Pronounced‘storves’.) ‘Doan’t say that stoves are not important – any housewife will tellyou different. Now there are six main types of stove …’ And on and on until hisaudience was glassy-eyed with boredom. Pat Pitman liked to refer to our ship asBore Two and John as Bore One.In Helsinki we called on my Finnish publisher, who took us to a restaurantoverlooking the harbour, and bought us an excellent meal of reindeer meat. Itwas also in Helsinki that we changed on to a Finnish ship which was morespacious and well-lit than the Russian vessel, and blessedly free of the smellof pungent soap. We sailed at sunset, and the red sky behind those tiny islandsin the bay was breathtaking, one of those moments in which I experienced anupsurge of sheer wellbeing. And as the ship turned west towards Leningrad, wewent down to the dining room to a buffet supper that was like a royal feast –vast plates of sliced smoked salmon, smoked eel, trout, a huge joint of ham,another of rare beef, quails in aspic, asparagus and pickled herring in cream.It was even possible to buy wine that did not taste as if someone had poured thesugar bowl into it.In Leningrad we used the boat as a floating hotel, and went back every evening.It was half an hour’s walk through the docks into the city, and there were notaxis. I was impressed by the size of the great square drainpipes on the side ofthe buildings, and the fact that they stopped a few inches above the pavement,so that when it rained, the pavement below them turned into a swollen river.Joy was wearing bright red tights – tights had recently become fashionable inLondon – and they created a sensation as we walked down the Nevsky Prospect, asdid Pat’s orange slacks. People actually turned and stared at us. The Russianwomen all looked depressingly drab, rather as British women used to during theSecond World War.But I was much impressed by the dishes of caviar on sale at green metal tablesin the Park of Peace – great pointed mounds of it, as big as a large ice cream,and all for a few roubles. Otherwise, the food was as atrocious as on theRussian boat. In a run-down restaurant in the Nevsky, we had to wait an hourbefore our food appeared, but at least they set on the table two huge fatcarafes of vodka – unbelievably cheap as usual – and dishes of sour pickles thatmade the eyes water until you flushed away the taste with vodka that tasted likefusel-oil.It was in this restaurant that there were not enough chairs at our table, and wewere directed to a back room to find some for ourselves. The place was full ofbroken chairs – chairs without a leg, chairs without a back, chairs with a holein the seat – and we had to do our best with what we could find.I was also struck by the sheer inefficiency of the waiters, who looked as ifthey had walked straight out of the pages of Oblomov or Dead Souls. Before weleft for Russia, I had read a life of Peter the Great that emphasised hisbrutality. But after a little experience of Russian waiters and tradesmen, Ibegan to sympathise with him, and saw that the knout might be the solution.Most of the time, we were followed around by a KGB man, although I cannotimagine why he bothered, since there seemed to be nothing worth spying on. Oneday we went out to the Peterhof Park – near the royal palace – and Bob went upand engaged him in conversation. He proved to be perfectly amiable and polite,and Bob did not embarrass him by asking why he was following us.On the visit to the Peterhof I was much amused by the Russian sanitaryarrangements. I wanted to urinate, and went into a wooden structure. Insidethere was a long board with round holes in it, and below these holes the grassyhillside descended steeply into what looked like a ravine. As I stood therewatching my urine cascade down the slope, a fat woman came in, heaved up herdress, sat down on one of the holes, and proceeded to relieve her bowels.Joy and I managed to find our way across Leningrad to the palace of Prince FelixYussupov, and went in the courtyard where Rasputin had been gunned down, andlooked down a flight of stairs that led to the basement where he was poisonedwith cyanide-filled cakes. The Intourist guide from whom we had enquired the waywas reluctant to encourage our morbid interest in the days before the GloriousRevolution that had freed Russia of such scum, and also strongly discouraged usfrom trying to find Dostoevsky’s house. He told us that Dostoevsky was no longerread.On our last evening, we were invited to a reception at the Astoria, Leningrad’smajor hotel, and introduced to Russian writers and literary bureaucrats. John’sRoom at the Top had been published with immense success there, and had made hima rouble millionaire. (The Russians published editions of fifty thousand as amatter of course.) The book was regarded as an attack on capitalistcivilisation, and John took care not to disillusion them.I overheard Pat asking a stern-faced lady who spoke good English whether therewere any important Soviet murder cases we ought to include in our encyclopedia.Snorting contemptuously, the lady told her that such crimes were virtuallyunknown under Communism.In most cities we had visited so far – Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki – Johnand I had been interviewed jointly as representatives of England’s ‘Angry YoungMen’. But here in Leningrad, no one seemed interested in me, and I spent most ofthe reception talking to Joy and Pat. The few Russian writers I was introducedto smiled politely, shook my hand, then drifted off. I assumed that this wasbecause no one in Russia had ever heard of me or of The Outsider.It was not until several years later that I discovered the facts, when Ireviewed a book about Khrushchev’s Russia by Alexander Werth. It turned outthat, on the day before we landed in Leningrad, Pravda had published an attackon Camus and myself, denouncing us as decadent Western writers. The article hadbeen written by Alexei Surkov, head of the Union of Soviet Writers – I had methim at the Astoria – but, according to Werth, had been inspired by Khrushchevhimself.John enjoyed himself playing the celebrity in Leningrad, and spent his roublesfreely. (He was not allowed to take them out of Russia.) And finally, he wasinvited to go on to Moscow as the guest of the Writers’ Union, while the rest ofus travelled back to England without him.Instead, we were joined on the boat by John Wain, a man, as I say, I had alwaysfound oddly lacking in charm. He seemed to be driven by a kind of will-to-power,possibly exacerbated by his feeling that the novels of Kingsley Amis were betterreceived than his own. He had no doubt that he was a far better and more seriouswriter than Amis – and I am inclined to agree – but I always found that hisnovels had a curiously unpleasant, bitter flavour, an offputting taste ofegotism and selfishness. His heroes are determined to get the girl into bed, butseem to have no personal feeling towards her – just a desire to remove herclothes. It struck me as a little like the attitude of a rapist to his victim.This aspect of his character was illustrated by an anecdote told me by RichardAdams, the author of Watership Down. He had been at a writers’ conference withWain, who was accompanied by an awful, loud American girl who made everybodycringe. Finally, when whisky had warmed them into a sense of intimacy, Adamsasked what Wain saw in her. Wain replied: ‘Well I’ll tell you. When thisevening’s over, we’ll go to the room, and I’ll lock the door, then I’ll fuck hertill the pictures fall off the walls.’Wain took a certain pleasure in being rude and abrupt. When I first met him hehad given me a copy of the paperback of Hurry on Down, but I had left it behindsomewhere. When Joy and I called in to see Wain at Reading University Imentioned that I had mislaid the book, and Wain immediately snapped: ‘Well I’mnot giving you another,’ although he knew perfectly well that this was far frommy thoughts. He enjoyed playing the gruff curmudgeon.Wain also had no doubt of his own genius, and I remember him remarking casually:‘When I get the Nobel Prize …’ A few years later I heard that he had moved toWales to write a big, serious novel, and when A Winter in the Hills came out in1970, I hastened to read it. But within fifty pages I was put off by the samebitter flavour of obsessive egoism, and inability to treat women as anything butobjects of conquest.Wain had an interesting story to tell me about Amis. A year or two earlier, BillHopkins and I had been at a party at the house of the publisher Anthony Blond,and had taken our drinks to the flat roof, and stood there looking at the view.Wain told me that he and Kingsley – now drunk – came up to the roof, and Amissaid: ‘Look, there’s that bugger Wilson – I’m going to push him over.’ As helurched towards me, Wain grabbed his arm and stopped him.It seemed that ever since my combative letter about his facetious review of TheOutsider, Amis had always regarded me with a kind of defensive caution. I likedhim, and always assumed he liked me. We met several times and seemed to be onfriendly terms – including that evening at his home in Swansea when we were onthe run from the press. Yet in his Memoirs, he tells that story and makes itappear that we gatecrashed rather than being invited. And in a letter he tellsPhilip Larkin that I had brought a bottle of whisky with me, but that my morbidinterest in murder had made him afraid to drink it in case it was poisoned, andthat he had finally given it away to someone, who had survived.It is true that Joy and I took a bottle of whisky with us when we called on him.But I had not at that point published the Encyclopedia of Murder, which came outin 1961. Amis clearly invented any story that sounded amusing. In the mid-60s,when I happened to see him in London, I suggested we meet the followinglunchtime for a drink. Brady and Hindley had recently been arrested for theMoors Murders, and Amis brought up the subject, and told me that he had talkedwith a policeman on the case, who had been present when the body oftwelve-year-old John Kilbride had been dug up. He lowered his voice and lookedgrave. ‘His trousers were round his knees and there was evidence of sexualassault.’ In fact, the body had been in the ground so long that sexual assaultwould have been impossible to determine.If someone had asked me during Amis’s lifetime I would have said that we werefriends, for we got on well and enjoyed talking about our favourite jazz. Hisreferences to me in his Collected Letters, however, published after his death,reveal a continuous vein of hostility. For example, he tells Larkin that Irefused to grant a journalist an interview unless it was ‘me, Shaw and Dante –OK?’ It does not seem to have struck him that any worthwhile journalist wouldhave told me to go to hell. The story had been invented by an over-imaginativefriend of mine, Wilfred De’ Ath, but even Amis should have been able to see thatit was too illogical to be true.I had always suspected that Amis, under the façade of nonchalance and humour,concealed the same deep lack of self-belief as Braine, a suspicion that hadfirst dawned on me when I read that he was afraid of the dark. He did a ratherbetter job of concealing it than Braine, but as he became older, increasingalcoholism revealed the depth of the problem. Braine’s deterioration became apparent when he arrived back from Russia. Hearrived at Pat’s home after a bender that had obviously lasted for days, andmade straight for the drinks cupboard. His ravings so upset Pat’s mother in law,who was on a visit, that she wanted to call the police. Pat wrote to me: ‘weboth quailed in the basement, whilst drunken shouts from above resounded throughthe house, along with the crashes of glasses against the fireplace’.When Pat’s daughter Katie came home from school, John calmed down. Pat heard himsay: ‘Eeeh, Katie, when you’re a bit older, will you come to look after me?’, towhich Katie responded promptly: ‘No fear!’On two subsequent occasions, Pat recalls, he arrived to take them out to dinnerso drunk that he could hardly stand, and the second time the taxi driver refusedto allow him to get in the cab.At least Braine had one consolation: in spite of the alcoholic crisis – orperhaps because of it – he had succeeded in inventing a key episode for a sequelto Room at the Top, in which Joe Lampton arrives home unexpectedly to find hiswife in bed with another man, and comes close to a total breakdown. The marriageis saved when he decides to stay with her for the sake of the children.After the Russian trip I began to feel increasingly exasperated with Johnbecause I sensed an element of play-acting about him. He played the part of thebluff Yorkshireman to impress people, but anyone who knew him felt he was tryingto convince you of something that wasn’t true.Our relations broke down not long after the Russian trip, and this came aboutwhen he quarrelled with Bill Hopkins.Bill and a businessman named Bob Guccione decided to launch a magazine thatwould appeal to the same audience as Hugh Hefner’s Playboy. To me the ideasounded like a non-starter. London already had a number of men’s magazines withtitles like King and Mayfair, and most of them had folded. Bill and Guccionenevertheless succeeded in raising about a thousand pounds between them, enoughto print a small glossy advertising pamphlet that described Penthouse as afreewheeling magazine for intelligent males with a taste for sexy ladies. I wasmentioned among those who would write for it; so was John Braine; so wasBertrand Russell – who threatened to sue them unless they removed his name.The pamphlet went out with a subscription form, and to Bill’s delight and myastonishment, subscriptions began to roll in – more than enough to print thefirst issue.Bill, as editor, decided to imitate a typical Playboy feature, the PlayboyForum, a kind of rolling dialogue that went on for issue after issue, in whichthe participants argued about the meaning of sexual freedom. Hefner, I believe,actually invited his celebrities to sit around a restaurant table for the‘forum’, but Bill and Guccione decided to reduce costs by doing it over thephone.One day Bill rang me and asked me what I thought about sex. Echoing GrouchoMarx, I said I thought it was here to stay. And so we went on talking for halfan hour or so, while I expressed many of the views that I would later put intomy Origins of the Sexual Impulse. Finally, Bill explained that he had beentaping the conversation, to use in the first Penthouse forum. I chuckled at thisexample of his Machiavellianism, and gave my permission to use it.Next Bill rang John Braine, and repeated the procedure. But John’s reaction onbeing told that he had been taped was explosive. He called Bill a ‘dirty littleguttersnipe’, and hung up after more scathing comments of the same nature.Bill rang me back, told me what had happened, and asked if I would ring John andtry and talk him round. I did, but it was no use. John was furious at what heconsidered an underhand trick.‘I’ve got a wife and child to support – I doan’t do things for nuthing.’Bill had told me to assure him that he would be well paid, but it made nodifference. John was now into his hard-headed Yorkshireman act, and carried awayby the kind of moral indignation he could summon at a moment’s notice. So I hadto ring Bill back and confess failure.Unfazed, Bill rang Stuart Holroyd, and asked his views on sex – then, half anhour later, admitted it had all been taped, and asked permission to use it.Stuart, of course, gave it at once. But when Bill reread it, he decided thatStuart was not controversial enough. So he simply put Stuart’s name to JohnBraine’s remarks, and printed them in the first Penthouse forum.I felt thoroughly irritable with John. It seemed typical of him to refuse to letBill print his comments on the grounds that he had a wife and child to support,and then decline to accept payment. What really worried him, I suspect, washaving his name in a ‘girly’ magazine.Sadly, Penthouse failed to realise Bill’s expectations of providing us all withan income. He omitted to get the partnership agreement in writing, and in duecourse was forced out.I, naturally, took Bill’s side in the argument with Braine, and for a long time,John and I ceased to communicate. But many years later I was asked to lecture tothe Society of Authors, and met John there. Naturally, neither of us raised thematter of the estrangement. John introduced me to his new lady – he and Pat hadlong since separated – and we had a friendly conversation. She was pleasantlyordinary and, like John and myself, middle aged.After my lecture, there was a question period, and John immediately rose to hisfeet, stuck his thumbs in the pockets of his cardigan, and told the audiencethat he was delighted to see his old friend Colin Wilson, whom he had knownsince the days when we were both labelled Angry Young Men … He went on for aquarter of an hour, while the audience, obviously accustomed to John hogging thefloor, waited resignedly for him to finish. John was perfectly sober – he toldme he no longer touched alcohol – but it was apparent that he was still unableto resist the temptation to launch into monologue.This was the last time I saw him. We occasionally exchanged books, but I foundJohn’s later novels virtually unreadable. For years now, since he had moved toWoking, he had been writing about suburban couples who are members of the localgolf club and have adulterous affairs with other suburban couples. Now he turnedto writing about an aging novelist who has left his nagging wife and foundhappiness with a mistress of his own age, his ‘one and last love’. But John hadfailed to recognise that even a mere two hundred pages about a blissfulrelationship are boring unless something happens. I said complimentary thingsabout both books, but could not, in fact, finish either.In 1986, a girl I knew rang me to say that John was in hospital with a burststomach ulcer. I rang the hospital to ask how he was, but they refused to giveme information on the grounds that I was not a relative. Shortly thereafter, Joyand I had to travel to Japan, where I was lecturing. We were sitting in a Tokyorestaurant, when my agent asked me if I had heard that John Braine had died thatday. It struck me as ironic that I should be so far from home when I heard ofthe death of an old friend, and wished that I had had a chance to see him atleast once again. It seemed so long ago since I had read Room at the Top, andexperienced that twinge of alarm in case this new writer would prove to be asecond Hemingway, who would give all of us a run for our money.I have often asked myself what exactly went wrong for John as a writer. And Isuspect that the answer lies in the parallel with Hemingway. Like Hemingway,John created a kind of alter ego that was completely unlike his real self. Onecritic caused deep offence by asking when Hemingway was going to come out frombehind the hairs on his chest. But John’s problem was not a question ofvirility. It was that he was a shy and sensitive person who was inclined to takea poor view of himself. Even when I first knew him, he often referred wryly tothe size of his midriff. I think he saw himself as someone rather like the frogprince in the fairy tale, unattractive to women, unimpressive to men. But hewanted to be seen as sensible, hard-headed and assertive. So this was the parthe chose to play. The trouble is that no one who is taken in by his ownplay-acting can survive as a serious writer.As his political opinions swung from left to right, John took pleasure inproclaiming himself a believer in flogging and capital punishment. And he failedto see that even his right-wing friends – like Kingsley Amis, Anthony Burgessand Bernard Levin – had no desire to sit and listen while he went on laying downthe law and flogging dead horses.He once told us that his most important piece of literary advice was given tohim by his father, who advised him to write only about what he knew well. Hestuck to this advice, and paid for it with an increasing narrowness of rangethat finally strangled his literary talent.In retrospect, I can see that John was a kind of dual personality. Part of himwas intelligent, sensitive, and had a genuinely deep human understanding. Buthis alter ego was entirely concerned with how other people saw him. I think herather envied Priestley the universal respect he earned during 1940, when he wasgiving those remarkable war postscripts on the BBC. The sensitive, human Braineonce remarked: ‘Even a spoilt rich lady with a fat Pekinese needs love as muchas anybody.’ But the Braine, who longed to be admired as a Yorkshire sage, wouldgo on talking reactionary politics until his audience was crying for mercy.Self-division is not supposed to be a mortal illness, but I think John died ofit."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12> AMERICASally was a pretty and lively child, and from the beginning I adored her.The day Joy returned with her from hospital brought me another importantinsight. Before I set out to pick them up from Redruth Hospital, the Daily Mailrang me, and asked if they could send a photographer over to get a picture ofthe baby. When I told Joy this, she exploded. She had disliked the press eversince the horsewhipping scandal. Now she said indignantly: ‘You might havespared me this!’ And we quarrelled.But when we got home, the journalists had still not arrived. The house was cleanand tidy, and the sun was streaming in the windows. Joy relaxed and, by the timethe photographer arrived, had become her usual serene and good-tempered self.She refused to be photographed, but left me holding the baby, who had so farbeen fast asleep. At that moment, Sally woke up and gave me a delightful smile.Joy assured me later that babies at ten days old do not smile, and that it musthave been wind. But it was not wind – my daughter smiled at me. And the pictureappeared the next day under the heading: ‘Angry Young Man holds placid younggirl’.In other words, Joy’s anger had been a merely superficial reaction, and when shefound herself back home on a sunny morning, she responded with a sense of‘Aren’t I lucky?’What I liked about Joy was that this happened so infrequently; her calm andserenity never ceased to make me feel ashamed of my own explosiveness.I found fatherhood a marvellous experience. When Joy had told me she waspregnant – that day when I was on a stepladder – I had not been at all sure thatI was pleased. I had been a father once before, and although I had foundRoderick a nice little boy, had not felt very ‘fatherly’ – perhaps at nineteen Iwas too young. With Sally it was quite different; I adored her from the momentshe appeared. I was inclined to suspect that this was because she was a girl,but when Joy went on to produce two boys, I found I adored them just as much. Iwas undoubtedly made for family life.Shaw once asked: is there a father’s heart as well as a mother’s? Sadly, henever had a chance to find out. But in my own case the answer was definitelyyes. I am an abnormally affectionate person, periodically overcome by the needto hug someone. (On one overdemonstrative occasion I cracked two of Joy’s ribs.)But with Joy and three children (Damon in 1965 and Rowan in 1971), even I hadenough outlet for my explosions of affection.It was just as well I had this warm and secure family background, for the 1960swas a decade of unremitting work to stay out of debt. When, ten years or solater, someone asked me to write a piece about the 1960s, I had to admit that Ihad not noticed them – I had been too busy working to keep my bank managerhappy.The problem was fairly simple. The £40,000 or so I had made on The Outsider wassoon spent since a sudden change in lifestyle always makes costs mount. Joyworked out that we needed roughly £5,000 a year for basic expenses: mortgage,electricity, petrol, telephone, and so on. If Gollancz gave me an advance of£500 on a book, it had to sell 2,500 copies to cover its advance, and most of mybooks sold two or three times that amount. The American edition would, withluck, make about the same. Foreign publishers usually paid an advance of £25 or£50; that was all I saw. So my basic income from books was about £4,000 a year.Journalism might bring another £1,000. But when the time came to pay themortgage there was usually a panic and a plunge deeper into overdraft. So thisnew life of being a ‘famous writer’ was rather less glamorous than it sounds.This must be qualified by saying that I had some wonderfully interesting times,and met some fascinating people. America was particularly rewarding.One day in Spring 1961, an American poet named John Brinnin rang me up. He wasin Cornwall on holiday, and I invited him round for a drink. Brinnin had beenresponsible for Dylan Thomas’s lecture tours of America. And in the course ofthe conversation, I asked him how I could arrange such a tour. He told me thatthe best way was to contact the Institute of Contemporary Arts in WashingtonD.C.Of course, America had killed Dylan Thomas – or rather, he had killed himself bydrinking too much. And Negley Farson had gone to America for a lecture tour in1937, but did not even start it – he had just stayed drunk in New York. Butalthough I loved wine, I had no inclination to alcoholism, so this did not worryme.The ICA in Washington said they would be happy to arrange a tour for me, and Iset out in September 1961. Whilst staying at the Algonquin, as I was droppingoff my key at the desk, I heard a messenger boy say: ‘A letter for Mr GrahamGreene.’ This reminded me that a journalist who had interviewed me had told methat Greene was staying in the hotel.It seemed a pity not to take advantage of a chance to meet an importantcontemporary. It was true that I had mixed feelings about Greene – even in thedays when my interest in the Christian mystics had made me sympathetic toCatholicism, I had disliked what seemed to me a kind of melodramatic pessimism,a deliberate attempt to paint the world black, in an attempt to convince thereader that the only answer lies in the Catholic Church. On the other hand, Ihad quoted the Russian roulette episode again and again, and the sudden insightof his ‘whiskey priest’ in The Power and the Glory who, facing a firing squad,knows ‘it would have been so easy to be a saint’. So I wrote Greene a note andasked the desk clerk to put it in his box.A few hours later, after eating a solitary steak supper in a Broadway bar, I wasback in my room, and preparing to go to bed, when my phone rang, and a voicesaid: ‘This is Graham Greene. Do you feel like coming down to my room for adrink?’It was only when I was in the lift that it occurred to me that I had said somerather unfavourable things about Greene in the book I had just finished, TheStrength to Dream. Therefore, as soon as I walked into his suite, I said: ‘Look,I’d better tell you, I’ve made some critical comments about you in my latestbook. I’d be glad to send you a proof, and include any comments you want tomake.’ Greene shook his head. ‘Quite unnecessary. Just send me the book whenit’s published.’In a letter to Joy, written the following morning, I summarised my impressions: > I was surprised by his appearance – a rather lanky man with a nervous, shy> manner and a faint lisp. Bulgy eyes, like a tired headmaster, and a rather> over-cultured, reedy, public-school voice. Altogether, he makes an impression> of weakness, and perhaps a defensive kind of shiftiness. His voice was> precious, very nervous and tense. But his face also gives an impression of> meanness – one could easily imagine him saying bitchy things. After more than forty years, I had forgotten that my first impression was sounfavourable.Apparently I made some attempt to outline some of my misgivings about his work,and this may explain why I tell Joy: ‘Although we had an interestingconversation for an hour and a half, he doesn’t relax and get friendly, likeCharles Snow.’I had not expected Greene to be so much the British public schoolboy. CyrilConnolly once claimed that no one who has been to an English public school evergets over the trauma; it leaves him slightly unsure of himself for the rest ofhis life. This is how Greene struck me. For example, he referred to himself as‘one’: ‘Of course, when one wrote Brighton Rock one felt completely different …’In spite of which, I spent an interesting time with him. The main thing I recallwas his account of souvenir shops where they sold ghastly relics – thatafternoon he had seen the hand of a dead airman. This reminded me of a passagefrom The Lawless Roads, in which Greene speaks of a teenage boy and girl who hadcommitted suicide by putting their heads on a railway line – she was pregnantfor the second time, and had had her first child at thirteen; her parents hadbeen unable to fix responsibility among fourteen youths. The double suicide andthe dead airman’s hand could be seen as effective symbols of Greene’s view ofreality.Back in my own room, kept awake by heat and the New York traffic, I reflectedthat Greene was much the kind of person I had expected. I had always felt thatthe gloom of his novels seemed to betoken low self-esteem: the kind of thingexperienced by so many of my ‘Outsiders’ – Barbusse’s hero in L’Enfer says: ‘Iam nothing and I deserve nothing.’ I had felt like that in my mid-teens – thedesire to ‘give God back his entrance ticket’. But years of struggle hadtoughened me until I realised that the ‘life-rejection’ of the Romantics was nosolution. Talking to Greene I could not help feeling that his pessimism sprangout of low vitality.The trouble was that I did not believe in Greene’s pessimism. I felt he wasusing it to build up a view of life whose gloom was slightly bogus. It justifiedthe grim atmosphere of Brighton Rock and The Power and the Glory, but made methink of the comment Tolstoy made about the work of Leonid Andreyev: ‘He keepson shouting “Boo!” but he doesn’t scare me.’ I suspected that the truth was thatGreene rather enjoyed life, particularly sex, and that his Jansenist view ofadultery only made ‘sinning’ more enjoyable.I had also noted a touch of paedophilia in Greene. In 1937, reviewing a ShirleyTemple film for the magazine Night and Day, he caused outrage by implying thatthe sight of the nine-year-old child star, whose knickers showed under her shortfrock, was intended to titillate dirty old men in grubby raincoats. TwentiethCentury Fox sued the magazine and won £3,500. By the time of the trial, Nightand Day had gone bankrupt.Again, in 1956, Greene recommended Nabokov’s Lolita as one of the best books ofthe year. Lolita was at that time only published in Paris by Olympia Press,which specialised in ‘dirty books’, and no one in England knew what Greene wastalking about. It was Bob Pitman who read the book, realised it was about amiddle-aged man having sex with a ten-year-old girl, and passed on thisinformation to John Gordon, editor of the Sunday Express, who denounced it inhis column. The result was a scandal that turned Lolita into a bestseller andmade Nabokov famous.When a writer sees paedophilia in a Shirley Temple film in 1937, and twentyyears later recommends Lolita as his book of the year, one might be forgiven forsuspecting that he has a touch of paedophilia in his own makeup.Equally interesting is the fact that, at a certain point in his life, Greenedecided that he no longer wanted to be a married man with a family – it was muchmore fun taking advantage of his fame to have love affairs – rather like havingan enormous harem. This he continued to do for the rest of his life.Any writer can understand this, and many have done much the same as Greene: H.G. Wells, for example. I have already described how, when The Outsider waspublished, I felt some frustration at being unable to take sexual advantage ofmy ‘fame’; given the opportunity, I might well have settled for a lifetime ofaffaires. But I knew that leaving Joy would be unforgivable, a kind of insult tofate. More importantly, I knew I had no right to wreck Joy’s life merely for thepleasure of sleeping with strange girls. And I knew too that she was far moreimportant than any casual affaire, and that having a wife and children was, forme, the way of life for which I was intended.When The Strength to Dream was published the following year, I sent Greene acopy as I had promised. As I expected, I never heard from him. I made another interesting acquaintance at the Algonquin. After lunch thefollowing day I was interviewed in the foyer by a columnist called LeonardLyons. After Lyons had finished and gone, a good-looking, big-chinned young mancame across to me and asked if I was Colin Wilson. He, it seemed, was RobertShaw, who was in New York acting in Harold Pinter’s play The Caretaker, whichwas opening off Broadway.When Shaw said he had acted at the Royal Court, I asked him if he knew JohnOsborne. He looked at me in an odd way and said: ‘He’s citing me asco-respondent.’ It seemed that one day when Osborne and Mary Ure had beenbickering in his presence, he had said to her: ‘If you ever decide to leave him,come to me.’ And one night a month or so later, there had been a knock on hisdoor, and it was Mary.Recalling her quarrelsomeness after she had been drinking, I did not envy him.Shaw had to go to a rehearsal, but we arranged to meet later. In a liquor shopopposite the hotel I saw that vodka was an absurdly low price – about twodollars a bottle. I bought a bottle, and when Shaw returned he came to my roomand we drank some of it, which was by no means bad. And Shaw brought me a copyof a novel he had just published, The Sun Doctor. I read its first chapter – allI had time for with my hectic schedule – and was impressed. Stylistically, itwas as good as Graham Greene.Like so many fine actors, Shaw was dissatisfied with interpreting other people’swords, and would have preferred to be a professional writer. When he told methat he had written a play, I suggested that we might collaborate. He seemed tobe interested in the idea, but it was never to come about. His acting careertook off. Two years later he played the part of the KGB killer in From RussiaWith Love, and two years after that, the Panzer general in The Battle of theBulge. By the time he played the shark fisherman in Spielberg’s Jaws he had puton a great deal of weight.Mary Ure died on the opening night of a new play by Shaw, in 1975, at the age offorty-two, from a mixture of whisky and tranquillisers. Robert himself died of aheart attack in 1978, at the age of fifty-one. I had been looking forward to this American tour. In fact, it proved to be sogruelling that I was in a state of exhaustion long before it was over. But tobegin with I had no cause to complain. I enjoyed getting to know New York andbeing interviewed by literary columnists. And I proved to be fairly well-knownthere – I went into a public lavatory in Greenwich Village, and a strangerasked: ‘Aren’t you Colin Wilson?’A few days later I took the night train to Washington – I had a broadcast earlyin the morning – and found the city full of the colours of autumn, withsquirrels running up and down the trees outside my hotel, the Brighton. I lostno time in asking the way to the nearest record shop, for I had seen the Schwannrecord catalogue, and it had made my mouth water: it was full of records thatwere not available in England, particularly the symphonies of Bruckner andMahler. (The long-playing record had been invented only about ten years earlier,so there were still many gaps in the catalogue.) The proprietor of the Disc Shopin Connecticut Avenue, a warm, enthusiastic man named Dan Danziger, tookpersonal charge of me, answered my queries, and invited me back to his home fordinner. It was the beginning of a friendship that has lasted to this day.I had a few lecture engagements at colleges and universities around Washington.The Outsider had reached the best-seller list and been something of a sensationin the United States. And since most students see themselves as rebels andoutsiders, I received a warm reception on the lecture platform. I enjoylecturing, and always do it without notes, which makes it easier to establish arapport with audiences. The enthusiasm would have gone to my head if I had notalready experienced this kind of thing when The Outsider came out. As it was, Isoon began to feel rather like a literary Elvis Presley, surrounded byenthusiastic admirers.Without exception, the professor with the task of introducing me began byexplaining that I was a ‘high-school dropout’, and then went on to say that mybooks were now published in twenty languages and my name known all over theworld. I did not mind these pardonable exaggerations, for I knew the Americansloved success stories, and were only doing their best to make their studentsfeel I was a worthy role model. As to me, I found it pleasant to bask in allthis acclaim and admiration, and to be a ‘college professor’ (an honorary rank Iwas granted in every place I visited).But I took care not to allow myself to become too self-satisfied. I always hadan underlying feeling that my real job was to write books. Being surrounded byadmirers certainly creates a delightful feeling of warmth, but good writingrequires an essentially cool environment. Besides, I actively dislike beingtreated as a guru; it embarrasses me.There was another disadvantage to becoming an instant cult figure on everycampus – it meant that I had little time to myself. If I went for a meal after atwo-hour lecture and question period, a crowd of students trooped along too –even the occasional professor. This meant talking non-stop, until I longed to beallowed to eat a meal alone.Partly to get some time to myself, I attended one of the lectures of theProtestant theologian Paul Tillich, at Georgetown University; his work hadalways interested me, with its emphasis on existentialism. The lecture theatrewas crammed, but it was hard to understand why, for Tillich was an extremelypoor lecturer, who expressed himself in a highly abstract Germanic English. (Hehad been driven out of Germany by the Nazis.) I concluded that the Americans aresimply fascinated by celebrity, and enjoy merely looking at someone they know tobe famous, whether or not they can understand what he is talking about.It was only much later, after Tillich’s death in 1965, that a book by his wifeHannah revealed that he was a kind of sex maniac, who obsessively seduced hisfemale students, and was often caught by his wife reading a pornographicmagazine concealed inside his Bible.The tour proper began after my stay in Washington. In Richmond, Virginia, Ichecked into a pleasantly old-fashioned hotel, the Jefferson, which probablylooked much as it had during Jefferson’s lifetime. I arrived at 5.30, had amartini in the bar, then went to find the dining room. I was shown to a seat ona kind of great balcony that looked down on the hotel lobby (there was a posteradvertising a Victor Borge concert), where a black waiter of ancient appearancelit two candles in silver candlesticks, then took my order. I had a dozenoysters – a delicacy I had learned to enjoy in London – followed by turkey, andhalf a bottle of good burgundy. And sitting there, listening to soft music, andnow slightly drunk, I had a strange feeling, as if taking part in a play, or afilm about my own life.The following day the professor who had left me to myself the previous eveningdrove me to Lexington, a hundred and thirty miles away, through lovely autumncountryside, with mist over the Blue Ridge mountains. At one point, there was astench so overpowering and sickening that he hastily closed the window –apparently a skunk had been hit by a car. I had not realised just how bad askunk smells.My lecture that evening at the university was a great success. Unfortunately, itwas followed by the usual party, in which I had to stand with a glass in myhand, being introduced to professors and their wives, and answering over andover again where I had been so far, where I was going next, and how I likedAmerica. This was the really depressing part of the American tour – dozens offaculty parties that finally all seemed to blend into one, so that it was hardto tell the difference. These, I can now see, were the real problem, for theycaused me to groan and switch on to ‘the automatic pilot’, which causes ourenergies to ‘leak’.So was a trip I made not long after to Los Angeles. I was lecturing at LongBeach College, and looked forward to seeing Christopher Isherwood and AldousHuxley.I had met Chris – no one ever called him Christopher – at Stephen Spender’s notlong after The Outsider came out. It had been a remarkable evening. A writernamed Jon Rose had been there, the ‘partner’ of Sandy Wilson, the author of TheBoy Friend, whom I had come to know well. Sandy was shy and reserved; Jon wasassertive and combative. He came from Australia, and liked to tell people thathe had been ‘the most fuckable dish in Sydney’. Volatile and insecure, Jon had ahuge chip on his shoulder.On the evening I met Chris, Jon had taken the centre of the floor – as he wasprone to – and was holding forth in an aggrieved tone, arguing with anattractive woman whose name I had not caught. He became indignant, and asked:‘Who do you think I am? Who do you think I am?’ The lady on the settee repliedsnappily: ‘A fucking self-assertive little queer.’ In a room with StephenSpender, Chris Isherwood and Chris’s boyfriend Don, this was hardly a tactfulthing to say. I found myself looking at her admiringly. Jon retired into hurtsilence for at least two minutes.The discussion turned to Angus Wilson, to whom I had dedicated The Outsider. Itold the story of how Angus had sent me a short story called ‘A Bit off theMap’, explaining that some people thought the polo-neck-sweatered hero wassupposed to be me. Nothing, he said, had been further from his thoughts. If Iobjected to anything in it, would I please make any changes I liked?I replied that I wouldn’t dream of demanding changes, although I made a coupleof suggestions for improving the story, which I considered less than his best.In due course, the story appeared in a volume called A Bit off the Map. Andvarious friends told me that Angus had been going around saying that the centralcharacter was based on me.I added that Angus himself had told me that an overpowering female in hisAnglo-Saxon Attitudes was based on Sonia Orwell – but had apparently denied thisto Sonia Orwell herself.Stephen Spender looked distinctly embarrassed. One or two other people coughed.Then the lady on the settee said: ‘I’m Sonia Orwell.’She turned out to be charming, if forthright, and Joy and I later gave her alift home to Soho, and talked to her for half an hour in the car.I had liked Chris immediately, and kept in touch with him – he lived in SantaMonica. Good-looking and boyish, he looked twenty years younger than his actualfifty-three. Unlike Stephen, with whom there was always a residue of shyness andawkwardness, Chris seemed a well-groomed, confident ex-public schoolboy, with anatural gift of inspiring affection. I never thought of him – as I thought ofSpender and Auden – as a member of the older generation; he was like acontemporary.Now I looked forward to seeing him again, and had written to say I was coming toL.A.At Long Beach College I became friendly with a lecturer in the Englishdepartment named Hugh Smith who, like me, enjoyed modern jazz. On my second dayat Long Beach, Hugh told me there had been a phone call for me from ChristopherIsherwood, asking me to ring him back. I did, and arranged to go over to see himthat afternoon at Santa Monica.Half an hour later, there was another message for me, this time from HenryMiller. He said he would like to meet me, and was willing to come to Long Beach.He would ring back later. When I heard that Miller lived at Pacific Palisades,not far from Santa Monica, I left a message suggesting that he should come toIsherwood’s, and save himself a long journey.Hugh offered to drive me up to Santa Monica. So we set out around lunchtime.As soon as I walked into Chris’s house, he said: ‘I’ve had a phone call fromthat dreadful bore Henry Miller. He’s coming over here shortly.’I asked: ‘Don’t you like him?’‘I’ve never met him. But I don’t like his books.’Tropic of Cancer had recently been published in America, after two decades as a‘banned book’, and had become a best-seller. I had read it years before inParis, as well as its sequel, Tropic of Capricorn, and concluded that Miller wasnot really to my taste.This had been confirmed when I found a copy of his book Sexus lying on a parkbench in London, and had not been surprised that its owner had abandoned it. Itopens with Miller falling in love with a ‘ten cents a dance’ girl he meets in adance hall, and becoming frantically enamoured. He pursues her and bombards herwith letters for days, until they meet and he takes her out for a meal. Andthen, as soon as they climb into a taxicab, she pulls up her skirt and plungeson to his erection. ‘We went into a blind fuck, with the cab lurching andcareening, our teeth knocking, tongues bitten, and the juice pouring out fromher like hot soup.’My feeling was that Miller seemed to revel in making sex sound coarse and nasty.I suspected that if he thought it would titillate the reader to describe havingsex with an elephant, he would have done it without hesitation. So I couldunderstand why Chris was not enthusiastic.The problem, it seemed, was that Chris had arranged to take me over to seeAldous Huxley that afternoon, and then later, to have tea with his next-doorneighbour Charles Laughton.The doorbell rang, and Hugh said he would take his leave. A moment later, Millerand his son Tony were shown in.Miller was shorter than I’d expected, but otherwise exactly like hisphotographs, with the almost completely bald head, the thin, almost ascetic facenot unlike Henry Ford, and heavy, sensual lips. He spoke with a Brooklyn accent,and you might have taken him for a cab driver or street sweeper.Tony was an intelligent, good-looking boy of about fourteen. We all shook hands,then stood around feeling awkward. Finally, plunging in head first, I askedMiller if he felt his books to be entirely serious, or whether the dirty bitshadn’t been inserted to please the foreign tourists.Miller looked irritated, and said (with his broad Brooklyn voice): ‘All youcritics are the same. You all write from here [tapping his head] instead of fromdown here [striking his solar plexus]. It’s just head knowledge.’This annoyed me so I said: ‘Come off it, Henry. I’m a writer too, and I’ve readD. H. Lawrence as well. You’re not among professors here.’After this, it looked as if my afternoon with Miller was going to be a definiteflop.In fact, he had a natural, easygoing charm that disarmed criticism. On the wayover to Huxley’s, in the back of Chris’s car, we talked generally about writing.He had never read any of my work, and seemed to have an idea that I’d writtenslightingly of him somewhere (which I hadn’t – even the mild criticisms ofOrigins of the Sexual Impulse were then unpublished).He mentioned that he was now, for the first time in his life, able to stopworrying about money, since Tropic of Cancer was a best-seller: on the otherhand, he said, he hadn’t yet seen much of the immense amount of money it wassupposed to have made. He seemed to feel that it might never materialise – theoutcome, I suppose, of sixty years of being permanently broke. In fact, as Ilearned later from a biography of him, he quickly spent most of it, and was soonas broke as ever.Huxley lived in a rented house in the hills behind Hollywood Boulevard – not hisown house, which had been destroyed in a brush fire the year before, togetherwith most of his books and manuscripts. (I had been told that he was on an LSDtrip at the time, and had found the flames so beautiful that he made no attemptto save his possessions.)I had met him a few years earlier in London, when he had taken me to lunch athis club, the Athenaeum. He was very tall, almost blind, with a rather thin,slow voice. I remember saying to him, as we stood side by side in the urinal: ‘Inever thought I’d be having a pee at the side of Aldous Huxley,’ and Huxleyreplied: ‘Yes, that’s what I thought when I was standing beside George V.’It is worth mentioning that Huxley had an amusing peculiarity: he did not knowhow to say goodbye on the phone. It was not that he was an obsessivephone-talker – simply that he was unable to end a conversation. I had noticedthis the first time I rang him, when he was staying with his brother Julian inHampstead – he talked for half an hour. I suspect that this tendency wasconnected with his gentle and kindly nature; in his latter years he struck manypeople as virtually a saint. But this inability to end a phone conversation alsobrings to mind the social ineptitude of so many of his heroes.And that, I should explain, is why my attitude to Huxley’s writing wasambivalent. I had first read him at the age of seventeen, urged on by Millicent,my colleague in the tax office, who regarded him with passionate admiration. Ihad plodded my way through Point Counterpoint and Eyeless in Gaza, detestingtheir feeble heroes, who seemed to be trapped in permanent self-doubt. Brave NewWorld struck me as wickedly clever, but suffered from the same fault. On theother hand, Antic Hay, which brightened my days when I was in the RAF trainingcamp, dazzled me with its brilliance, and still seems to me his best novel. So Iregarded Huxley with a mixture of respect and exasperation.Our misgiving about taking Miller to meet Huxley proved unnecessary. It turnedout that they had met long before, and (to my relief) seemed glad to see oneanother again. It was strange to see them together: Miller was then seventy,Huxley was three years younger, but it was Huxley who seemed the old man; Millergave the impression of being about fifty. Huxley was so short sighted as to bealmost blind; his voice was slow and precise, like a professor lecturing, and hewalked with his shoulders bent. Miller had something very youthful about him – aready enthusiasm, a lack of dignity, bouncing with a kind of happy vitality,like a friendly puppy. I have met many famous writers, but never one who seemedso unconscious of his position. I am sure that if a shop assistant told him tostop shoving, he would have looked crestfallen and guilty. No doubt this was oneof the results of not achieving fame until he was in his fifties.They made an odd pair – Huxley using the occasional Latin tag or quotingsomething in French, Miller listening like a schoolboy and occasionallyshouting, ‘Sure!’Although Huxley had come to accept the basic principle of religion in recentyears, and there was something almost saint-like in his mildness, there wasstill more than a touch of the amusing malice that can be found in PointCounterpoint. He mentioned a block of government offices that Le Corbusier hadbeen asked to design in Delhi; the architect decided to make them mostly ofglass, forgetting that the Indian sun would turn it into an enormous hothouse.Huxley chuckled like a saturnine headmaster as he described the clerks beingslowly roasted by this huge magnifying glass.At one point, Isherwood mentioned Lope de Vega. Huxley asked if he had read him,and Chris said yes, one or two plays. ‘Is he any good?’ Chris said no. Huxleysmiled happily. ‘I’m so glad, I’ve always felt guilty about not reading him, andnow I don’t feel guilty any more.’I had a lot to talk to Huxley about, so after a while I rather monopolised theconversation. Since I had been lecturing for weeks on my ‘new existentialism’,my mind was full of ideas, and new ways of expressing them. Since we were onlythere for an hour or so, I felt I had to get these over as briefly as possible –Huxley and I had been corresponding then for two or three years, but oddly atcross purposes. So I talked like a machine – fast, but with all the precision Icould muster. Huxley didn’t respond much – it struck me that he didn’t seem towant to wrench his mind off the problems of world population (which he had beenwriting about when we came) to think about existentialism.I never saw Huxley again; he was to die on 22 November 1963 of cancer of themouth. But since he died on the same day Kennedy was assassinated, his death wascompletely overshadowed by that of the president.As we left Huxley’s house, I realised that I had at least ‘come across’ toMiller. He grasped my hand and said, ‘Gaad, I never heard anybody talk like thatbefore!’ (Knowing that he was a friend of Lawrence Durrell, I didn’t take thiscompliment too seriously.) Miller had the faculty of making people like him byseeming to like and admire them; both Chris and I noticed this.After dropping off Henry and Tony at Pacific Palisades, and meeting his Japanesewife and pretty daughter Val, Isherwood and I drove back to Santa Monicaagreeing that Miller was one of the nicest men we’d ever met, and that he’d haveno hostile critics if he could meet and talk with them all.Later that evening, Chris took me to see Charles Laughton – who was alreadysuffering from the illness that was to kill him in the following year – and hiswife, Elsa Lanchester.This proved to be as amusing and memorable in its way as the meeting with Huxleyand Miller. Laughton was a big man with a large stomach, and that superblymodulated voice that everyone remembers from Mutiny on the Bounty. He was makingthe film of Advise and Consent, in which he was playing a southern senator, andhe performed one of his major speeches for us. It was amazing to see himtransformed from the suave English actor to an earnest native of Georgia.Laughton proved to be that exceptional rarity, a highly intelligent andwell-read actor, and told amusing anecdotes about Brecht (in whose Galileo hehad created the title role), Thomas Mann and H. G. Wells.Wells, of course, had been a well-known womaniser, and I enjoyed collectinganecdotes about him. I had become a friend of the pianist Harriet Cohen (who hadbeen the mistress of the composer Arnold Bax), and she had once shown me hertwenty-first birthday book, with the signatures of all the guests who had cometo the party, including Wells, Shaw and D. H. Lawrence. I noted that Wells’ssignature was at the top of the list and Harriet confirmed that he had been thefirst to arrive. Knowing that Harriet had been incredibly beautiful, I askedher: ‘Did Wells make a pass at you?’ ‘Oh yes.’ ‘What happened?’ She said: ‘Hegazed into my eyes, and said: “I’m gonna have you …”’ I asked: ‘And what did yousay?’ Harriet said: ‘Oh yeah?’When Elsa Lanchester told me she had known Wells, I asked: ‘Did he make a passat you?’ ‘Yes’. ‘What happened?’She told me that they had met at Garsington, the home of Lady Ottoline Morrell,the society hostess. Elsa and Wells had been standing on a small hump-backedbridge over a stream, and Wells had gazed into her eyes and said: ‘I’m gonnahave you.’ ‘And what did you say?’ Elsa replied: ‘Oh yeah?’ I roared withlaughter at the coincidence.Laughton had read about the horsewhipping episode with Joy’s parents, and when Itold him about how we had been pursued by the press, he made the interestingcomment: ‘The British press is the dirtiest in the world. American journalistshave a bad reputation, but they’re not nearly as bad as in England.’ And he tolda story of how he had recently been in England, and a journalist had asked himabout his part in Advise and Consent. The journalist had said: ‘Of course, wecan understand why they cast you in the film. But why did they choose an oldhas-been like Franchot Tone?’Whatever he replied would have been wrong. Even if he had said: ‘I don’t agreethat Tone is a has-been’, the remark would have sounded as if he was defending adown-and-out actor. So he simply turned and walked away.I was charmed by Laughton, who told me to call him Charles, called me ‘YoungWilson’, and put his arm round my shoulder. A fleeting suspicion crossed my mindthat he might be homosexual, then I dismissed it – he had been married to ElsaLanchester since the 1930s. It was only after his death that I learned that notonly was he homosexual, but that Elsa Lanchester was lesbian, and that theirmarriage was a kind of smokescreen.The next day, back at Long Beach, I saw Hugh Smith, who said: ‘I could hardlybelieve my ears – Henry Miller, Aldous Huxley, Charles Laughton and ElsaLanchester. It was like hearing someone say: “We’re going over to seeShakespeare, then calling on Ben Jonson, and after that I’m taking you for adrink with Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth …”’ * * *Long before the end of the tour, I was becoming very tired. In Winston Salem,where I was lecturing at the Baptist College, I discovered that I had a dayfree, and decided to spend it in bed, resting. Someone had lent me a copy ofEsquire which contained a complete novel by Dürrenmatt – The Quarry, the sequelto The Judge and his Hangman. But although I spent the whole day relaxing andreading, it left me feeling even more tired – and taught me that mere relaxationis not the best way of restoring depleted energies. Doing something withinterest and enthusiasm is the right way. But when you have been talkingnon-stop for weeks it is hard to think of anything that would restore thefeeling of ‘absorption’.On the day I was due to fly out from Washington, the accountant of the Instituteof Contemporary Arts asked me into his office, studied the record of myearnings, and told me that I owed the US government several hundred dollars inincome tax. This was a blow I had not expected, for I had thought my Americanincome would be taxed, like American book royalties, by the British government.I had to write him a cheque, then accompany him to the tax office to have myvisa stamped before I was allowed to leave the country. That meant, in effect,that I was leaving as broke as when I arrived. Now I could begin to understandwhat Stephen Spender meant when he said that Dylan Thomas was the first poet whohad been killed by the tax man."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13> THE PEAK EXPERIENCEBack in England in early December, I realised how much the ten-week tour hadtaken out of me – I felt exhausted and bad-tempered for weeks, and it was twomonths before I began to feel normal again. This is clearly because givinglectures and meeting people never seizes my interest in the way that writing andthinking do, and the resulting boredom and lack of inner pressure leads to acontinual leakage of vitality.But at least the tour had one important result: it had brought me somefundamental insights. Repeating my ideas over and over again to lectureaudiences had made me really begin to understand what I was trying to say.To begin with, I realised that what I was talking about was a leap forward inhuman evolution.This in itself was not new; in fact, it had first dawned on me one day in 1960when I had been lecturing to the Shaw Society in London. At the end of my talk Iheard myself saying that I believed that man was on the point of an evolutionaryleap to a higher stage. I thought about this afterwards, wondering if I reallymeant it, or whether it was merely one of those things we sometimes say in theexcitement of the moment. But the more I thought about it, the more I realised Idid really mean it.In retrospect, I can see that one of the major factors that led to thisconviction was the work of the American psychologist Abraham Maslow.Four years after the American publication of my book The Age of Defeat – underthe title The Stature of Man – I had received a letter from Maslow, who was aprofessor at Brandeis University. He explained that he had been impressed by theoptimism of The Stature of Man, and about the way I had pinpointed the sense ofdefeat the permeates our culture.Maslow had begun to have certain doubts about Freudian psychology, feeling thatit ‘sold human nature short’. This was something I had felt strongly for years:Freud’s view that all our deepest urges are sexual seemed to me to leave outsome of the most important members of the human race, from Leonardo to BernardShaw. I had come close to quarrelling with Freud’s grandson Lucian after I hadwritten a newspaper article attacking Freud for his sexual obsession – but then,Lucian himself struck me as something of a sexual obsessive.One of Maslow’s basic insights had come when he was studying monkey psychologyin the Bronx zoo. The monkeys were given simple puzzles to solve and, when theysolved them, were given a banana as a reward. Next Maslow tried substituting awooden banana, which would be exchanged for a real banana, and the monkeysworked just as well. Finally he tried offering them no reward, and still themonkeys went on trying to solve the puzzles. This was completely contrary to thevarious motivation theories of the time. We know that humans enjoy solvingcrossword puzzles ‘for fun’, but monkeys were supposed to be interested only infood.Yet here were Maslow’s monkeys solving problems because they clearly enjoyed it.Could it be, Maslow wondered, that all living things share a fundamentalevolutionary urge – the craving to learn?What fascinated me most about the Maslow material was his remark that, as apsychologist, he had got tired of studying sick people because they talked aboutnothing but their sickness. So he looked around for the healthiest human beingshe could find, and studied them instead. And he quickly made an interestingdiscovery: all his healthy subjects had, with a fair degree of frequency,moments of sudden immense happiness. He came to call these ‘peak experiences’(or PEs). The peak experience was not necessarily ‘mystical’ in the religioussense – just a sudden overflowing of sheer joy and vitality.He noted the case of a young mother who was preparing breakfast for her husbandand children. Suddenly a beam of sunlight came in through the window, and asurge of happiness lifted her into the peak experience.Again, he described the case of an American marine who had been on a remoteisland in the Pacific for years without seeing a woman. When he got back tobase, he saw a nurse, and instantly had a peak experience – not because he feltsexually aroused, but because he suddenly realised that women are different frommen. Habit causes us to think of them both as types of human being, when theyare actually as different as horses are from cows.Maslow’s observations impressed me deeply. The Outsider had been about poets andartists who had peak experiences looking at nature. But most of them felt thatsuch experiences are incompatible with the triviality and boredom of everydaylife, and retreated into a gloomy world of subjectivity. What I now knew wasthat there is no point in retreating from life. It is important to be strongenough to cope with it.But Maslow’s most important observation was that when he talked to his studentsabout peak experiences, they began remembering peak experiences they hadhalf-forgotten, and began having peak experiences all the time.I began thinking about the example of the mother at breakfast. Her peakexperience sprang from the feeling: ‘Aren’t I lucky?’ But she was lucky beforeshe had the peak experience. What made her aware of it was the sudden flood ofvitality that came from being reminded that she was lucky. (The philosopherFichte said: ‘To be free is nothing; to become free is heavenly.’)The mother’s experience made me recall something that had happened when I was aschoolboy. I was sitting in the cinema, and as the film came to an end, Irealised I was feeling very happy about something. Then I remembered. Thatafternoon we had broken up from school for the long August holiday. I hadforgotten exactly what I was feeling happy about, but the happiness remained asa kind of pleasant glow. Later I came to label this glow ‘underfloor lighting’.It happened in my teens, when I had been working as a navvy for the Leicestercorporation. I had been sent to a dreary place called Stocking Farm, where wewere laying electricity cables. It was a wet, cold day, and the place was deepin mud. But that evening, I was taking out a girl called Bobbie, and becausethat was at the back of my mind, the mud and the rain lost their power todepress me.So, in fact, thought itself was acting as a counterweight to the mud and rain.I also recalled how I used to return home from the wool factory, feelingexhausted and depressed, and then go to bed and read poetry. And after soakingmyself in a bath of gloom, reading Poe and Eliot and Thomson’s ‘The City ofDreadful Night’, I would become steadily more cheerful, and turn to Shelley’s‘Ode to the West Wind’ and Milton’s ‘L’Allegro’, and end up bubbling with energyand happiness. Again, thought had dispelled the negative feelings.Now here again, as I read Maslow, I was glimpsing a new possibility in humanevolution. It was the intuitive recognition that human beings can control theirfeelings through thought. We wake up on a rainy day, remember that we have topay a large bill, and allow a kind of gloom to settle on us like grime on a carwindscreen. We are forgetting that we have the equivalent of windscreen wipersand a windscreen washer: it is stupid to allow the negative feelings toinfluence us for hours. We are simply forgetting powers we actually possess.The implications are tremendous. We all possess the ability to switch on‘underfloor lighting’ at will. Maslow’s young mother was reminded that she waslucky by a beam of sunlight. All she had to do to renew the experience was tosit down and reflect on her good fortune for a few minutes, until it had been‘saved’ in her unconscious mind as I can ‘save’ this text by hitting a key on mycomputer. That may sound easier said than done – until we recall that Maslow’sstudents began to have peak experiences all the time when they began to talkabout peak experiences.The conclusion seems to be that we all have a layer of happiness just below thesurface of the mind, and that the problem is how to penetrate down to it. Afterall, we are all lucky to be alive, as Dostoevsky realised as he stood in frontof the firing squad. Hans Keller, the former music director of the BBC, tellshow, when he was in Germany in the 1930s, and fellow-Jews were vanishing intoconcentration camps, he thought: if only I could get out of Germany I wouldnever be unhappy for the rest of my life. In other words, he felt he merely hadto hit the ‘save’ key.I could soon distinguish two levels of peak experience. In its simplest form, itwas simply a matter of ‘feeling good’, which acted as a kind of windscreen wiperthat swept away negative feelings, and restored a sense of the reality of thefuture.But there was a second level that carries a definite sense of meaning.Chesterton, after all, had talked about ‘absurd good news’, and news is bound tobe about something. This ‘news’ was about human life, and my own life inparticular, and brought an absolute certainty that, in spite of practicalproblems, I had no cause for doubt or anxiety. All I had to do was grind on,like a tractor ploughing a field, and the rest would be taken care of. I had astrong feeling that some power apart from myself was in charge of my life.There was obviously a third level – of meaning made visible and overwhelming, afeeling that the outside world and everything in it is communicating with you asclearly as if speaking in your ear. Aldous Huxley experienced the same effectunder mescalin, although my own mescalin experience – which I shall describe –was quite unlike this. The closest I came to ‘the third level’ was when I wasdriving back from the Lake District, and felt the sensation of intensifiedawareness, as though I could see through mountains to the other side.But Huxley also noted that our senses are filters, designed to keep things outas much as to let them in. We can adjust them, like drawing the curtains on ahot day. To me it seems clear that being able to achieve the third level wouldbe like standing on the top of Everest when you already know what it is like tostand on top of the Matterhorn. What is really important is the intellectualconviction that ‘absurd good news’ is a reality.Maslow was by no means the first psychologist to recognise that the mostremarkable thing about human beings is that we possess free will. Probably thathonour goes to an eighteenth-century French philosopher called Maine de Biran.At that time, thinkers like Cabanis and La Mettrie argued that man is a machine– in fact, La Mettrie wrote a book of that title. At first Maine de Biran wasinclined to agree – until he recognised one day that when I make some effort, Ihave a clear feeling that it is I who am making it not a machine. I may feelmechanical when I am doing something that is boring and automatic, but themoment I exert my will, I become aware that I possess an active power.However, Maine de Biran’s insights were unfashionable; the French preferred tobelieve that man is a machine and nothing but. And even today, very little haschanged: the major French thinkers – Derrida, Baudrillard, Lyotard, Deleuze –remain mechanists. Soon after my return from America I also stumbled on another vitally importantidea: that precisely 5 per cent – or one in twenty – of any animal group –including humans – is ‘dominant’.This came about when I discovered a book called African Genesis, by the Americanplaywright and film scriptwriter Robert Ardrey. In fact, I bought the book forJoy, because it looked the kind of thing she would enjoy, then read it and wasoverwhelmed by it. Ardrey was arguing that human beings originated on theAfrican savannas about two million years ago, and that they learned to walkupright to leave their hands free for the use of weapons – like bone clubs.I was not particularly concerned about why man had decided to walk upright. Whatexcited me was the idea that human beings had come into existence through anevolutionary leap.I wrote to Ardrey care of his publisher, and he replied. We were soon engaged ina regular correspondence, and when he came to England – he lived in Rome – hetook the trouble to travel to Cornwall to see me.Ardrey told me that ‘the dominant 5 per cent’ had been discovered during theKorean war, when the Americans were puzzled that there were no escapes byAmerican prisoners of war. Eventually, they discovered the reason. The Chinesehad studied their prisoners carefully until they established which of them was‘dominant’ – which had leadership qualities. They took these prisoners andplaced them under heavy guard in a separate compound. And the other prisoners,deprived of the ‘troublemakers’, became so passive that the Chinese could leavethem with almost no guard at all. The number of ‘troublemakers’ was always thesame – 5 per cent.Bernard Shaw had known about this. At the beginning of the twentieth century, hehad asked the explorer H. M. Stanley: ‘If you were sick, how many other membersof your party could take over from you?’ and Stanley had replied: ‘One in twenty– five per cent.’And, Maslow also knew about the 5 per cent. In his days as an experimentalpsychologist, he had decided to undertake a study of dominance in women. Hedeliberately chose women because they tended to be more honest than men (whowere inclined to stretch the facts in the interest of self-esteem). He quicklydiscovered that women fell into three distinct ‘dominance groups’: high, mediumand low.High-dominance women – 5 per cent – tended to be sexually aggressive, and likedhigh-dominance males – the kind of man who would tear off their clothes andfling them on a bed. They were sexually experimental, promiscuous, masturbatedfrequently and often enjoyed lesbian activity. They regarded the male sexualmember as beautiful.Medium-dominance women – by far the largest group – were romantics who werelooking for Mr Right. They liked being given flowers and taken to restaurantswith soft lights. They were capable of mild promiscuity, but really wanted ahome, children and the other advantages of a stable marriage. Their feelingabout the male sexual member tended to be neutral.Low-dominance women were afraid of men. They liked the kind of man who wouldadmire them from a distance without speaking. And they thought the male sexualmember was downright ugly.Maslow made the interesting discovery that all women wanted a male who wasslightly more dominant than they were, but not too much more. Maslow evendevised tests that would show whether the ‘dominance gap’ between a male andfemale contemplating marriage was too great, not great enough, or just the rightsize.Relationships in which the woman was dominant were seldom happy. One highlydominant woman spent years looking for a more dominant male, but was neversuccessful. Finally, she found a man who was more dominant, but not enough. Soshe would cause quarrels that made him lose his temper. He would then slap heraround, hurl her on a bed and virtually rape her. These she found the only trulysatisfying sexual experiences.Both men and women wanted a partner within their own dominance group.Medium-dominance women were afraid of high-dominance males, while low-dominancewomen were afraid of medium-dominance males. As to high-dominance males, theywould have sex with any woman who was available – ‘prick fodder’ – but could notget personally involved with someone who did not belong to their own dominancegroup.I could see at once that my relationship with Joy was something of an anomaly. Iwas obviously high-dominance; she was obviously medium-dominance. From thebeginning, I liked her sweetness and her intelligence and her conscientiousness.But what cemented our relationship was her sexual shyness and reserve, the factthat we did not become lovers for many months. Men tend to devalue what they gettoo easily. And by the time we became lovers, I had become completely addictedto her.This also explained why her parents had tried so hard to separate us. They hadrecognised instinctively that the dominance gap was too wide and that theirdaughter was likely to end up hurt – or worse still, pregnant and abandoned.Fortunately, for the reasons explained, they turned out to be wrong – I writethis when we have been together almost fifty years.This insight into the role of dominance was a revelation. I realised that thiswas the vital clue to the problem of ‘Outsiders’. They were not – as I had saidin my book – simply frustrated men of genius. Barbusse’s hero says: ‘I amnothing and I deserve nothing.’ But they all belonged to the ‘dominant 5 percent’, and it was their natural dominance that made them dissatisfied. Before hebecame an actor, the great Henry Irving was a bank clerk. But imagine what wouldhave happened if he had remained a bank clerk and never tried to become anactor. He would have been deeply unhappy and frustrated, yet would not have beenable to find out what was wrong with him. A dominant person remains dissatisfiedand thwarted until he has placed himself in a position in which he can exercisehis dominance.Two or three centuries ago, such a person would find it far easier to find hisplace in society, because life was less competitive. To begin with, in a smallpopulation, the dominant ones would have less rivals. In our overpopulatedworld, there are millions of dominant individuals, and establishing theirposition is far more difficult.I could see, for example, that Sandy Wilson’s boyfriend Jon Rose – the one SoniaOrwell dismissed as a ‘fucking self-assertive little queer’ – was a dominantperson, and that this was his problem. The publicity director of HoughtonMifflin, Pat McManus, who had looked after me in New York, had been in charge ofJon and Sandy when they came over for the Broadway production of The Boy Friend,and said that Jon had soon made himself detested by his assertiveness. At pressconferences, he kept interrupting and answering questions intended for Sandy. Hecould not get used to the idea that it was the gentle Sandy that journalistswanted to speak to, and not Sandy’s abrasive and opinionated partner. Jon died afew years later of some minor illness; but undoubtedly he really died offrustration.What does this mean for ‘Outsider theory’? That ‘Outsiders’ are members of thedominant 5 per cent, and that they remain Outsiders until they have found someway of expressing their dominance.It is important to understand that 5 per cent is a huge number of people. Everyfactory foreman, every sergeant in the army, every supermarket manager, belongsto the dominant 5 per cent.John Calhoun, a scientist at the Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda,Maryland, performed an experiment with rats that led to some astonishinginsights. Calhoun wanted to study the effect of overcrowding in rats, so heplaced a large number of them in two interconnected cages. A highly dominantrat, a ‘king rat’, took over one of the two cages for himself and his harem, sothat the remaining rats were now grossly overcrowded in the remaining cage. Andwhat then happened was that the dominant 5 per cent became a criminal 5 percent. They did things that rats do not normally do, like raping female rats(rats, in fact have an extremely elaborate courting ritual), and becomingcannibals and eating babies. In other words, when the dominant 5 per cent has nooutlet for its dominance, it becomes a criminal 5 per cent. This explains why somany human criminals emerge from slums, or deprived backgrounds.But the really interesting point here is that there are a very small number ofrats who are so dominant that they are ‘king rats’. These are not ordinarymembers of the 5 per cent; they are probably more like .005 per cent.There is another important observation to be made here. Most of the dominant 5per cent need other people to express their dominance: the actor needs hisaudience, the politician needs his electorate. But there are a very small numberof dominant human beings – maybe .005 per cent who do not need other people toexpress their dominance. For a tiny percentage of artists or poets, the need tocreate works of art and literature is of more importance than being‘recognised’. These are what Wells called ‘Originative intellectual workers.’But here again there is an interesting corollary. The latest research on AlbertEinstein shows that he was driven by strong sexual urges, particularly towardscleaning women. Richard Feynman, the great quantum physicist, made a habit ofseducing his female students and even the wives of his male students. John vonNeumann, the father of computers, could never enter a room with a pretty girlwithout dropping a pencil on the floor and trying to peer up her dress. Thepsychologist Jung often seduced his female patients. And the theologian PaulTillich, as already noted, was an obsessive seducer of his students and anyother woman who would cooperate. Obviously, this does not imply that he was aninsincere Christian or a bad theologian – merely that, like most men of highdominance, he was a Jekyll and Hyde.These people were undoubtedly members of the .005 per cent. Yet in spite oftheir track record as seducers, they did not need other people to express theirdominance. They were driven by a basically impersonal urge, the evolutionaryurge to create. As Shaw said, such men create new mind as surely as any womancreates new men.‘Outsiders’, then, are the evolutionary spearhead of the human race. In whichcase, how is it that so many of them have gone insane or committed suicide? Whyhave so many concluded that human life is meaningless and pointless?When my daughter Sally was four years old, I had an experience that showed methe answer.Joy and I had spent a few days in Leicester with my parents. On our way home, weintended to stop in Bristol to see a remarkable painter called Bill Arkle.We set out at about two in the afternoon, after I had drunk two pints of beerwith my father in the Coleman Road Working Men’s Club. That was a mistake.Within an hour I was yawning and fighting off a feeling of sleepiness.Our route lay through Cheltenham, where there was an excellent second-handbookshop run by my friend Alan Hancox. I looked forward to browsing there forhalf an hour before driving on to Bristol.We were able to park almost in front of the shop, and I went in with Sally,while Joy rearranged luggage in the boot of the car to make way for books.After about ten minutes, Sally said: ‘Where’s mummy?’ I took her to the door andpointed to Joy, and Sally trotted off towards her. I went back and continued tobrowse. Five minutes later, Joy came into the shop alone, and I naturallyassumed that Sally was in the car. Another five minutes passed before I askedcasually: ‘Where’s Sally?’ and Joy said: ‘I don’t know – she was with you.’There was instant panic. We rushed to the door and looked into the crowdedstreet. There was no sign of Sally. She must have trotted straight past Joy.I went one way and Joy went the other. I was in a state of panic. Since she hadbeen born, Sally had never been out of our sight. And now she had disappeared.My head filled with lurid fantasies. What if someone had lured her into a carand kidnapped her? What if she stepped off the pavement and was killed by a bus?It was the rush hour in Cheltenham, and the street was crowded with traffic.I reached a traffic light, and a barrier at the edge of the pavement. She hadobviously not gone this way. I hurried back and met Joy, who had obviously hadno luck either. Off we went again in opposite directions. I found it impossibleto believe that we had lost my daughter, and that this disaster had descended sosuddenly.When I went back a second time, Joy had found her. She had walked around thecorner and to the other side of the block. But fortunately she had stayed on thepavement.We took her back in the shop with us, and bought the books I had piled up at theside of the till. I was dizzy with relief. And as we drove away, I experiencedan immense delight. I was thinking: ‘Aren’t buses beautiful objects? And isn’texhaust smoke a pleasant smell?’It began to rain as we got on to the Bristol road, and road works meant we hadto crawl along in a traffic queue. But I felt no impatience. I had the windowwide open, and everything seemed beautiful. When we arrived at Bill Arkle’s anhour later, I was still in a state of euphoria.What had happened, of course, was basically what had happened to Greene afterplaying Russian roulette. I had been sunk in a kind of indifference and boredom.Then the crisis of losing Sally had galvanised me into a kind of frenzy. Thesubsequent relief transformed the world into a paradise.Now Edmund Husserl – the philosopher on whose ‘phenomenology’ Heidegger andSartre based their existentialism – had one tremendous basic insight: thatconsciousness is intentional. When you look at something, you direct yourattention at it like a light beam. Without this effort of attention, you wouldbe hardly aware of what you were seeing. Think of what happens when you look atyour watch with your mind on something else. You have to look at it again to seewhat time it is. You could compare your act of perception to a whaler throwing aharpoon at a whale. When you ‘see’ things, your attention has harpooned them.Then why is it that we usually see things as so dull and boring? We do not throwthe harpoon hard enough. Where ‘intentionality’ is concerned, humanconsciousness is habitually lazy.Why? Here I must mention another of my central ideas: the ‘robot’. We all have akind of robot in our unconscious minds which does things for us, like a servant.You learn to type slowly and painfully, but at a certain point, your robot takesover and does it far more efficiently than you could. He drives your car andtalks French for you.But there is a problem. This excellent servant often does things that we wouldprefer to do ourselves. You hear a piece of music that moves you deeply. Butafter the tenth time, the robot is listening instead of you. You go for afavourite country walk, but the robot somehow takes away half the pleasure.The problem is simple. The robot takes over when we are tired, cutting in like athermostat. He can drive you home from work, and you cannot even remember thejourney.Clearly, ‘robotic’ consciousness is far less intense than ‘wideawake’consciousness. What Greene did when he pointed the gun at his head and pulledthe trigger was to wake himself up, to make his consciousness twice as‘intentional’.Losing Sally in Cheltenham had also acted as an ‘alarm clock’, and made me twiceas awake. And suddenly I saw the world with the intensity that Van Gogh had seenit when he painted ‘The Starry Night’.Obviously, ‘normal consciousness’ is half-asleep, and we have to learn how topersuade it to wake up. At first I was inclined to think that the answer lies inthe sudden shock, the sudden crisis. But as a method of inducing peakexperiences, Russian roulette would be rather dangerous.And then I began to see the answer. Before Greene played Russian roulette, hismind was slack and bored. When he pulled the trigger, his consciousness wassuddenly galvanised by the expectation of death, and contracted. And when therewas just a click, he breathed a sigh of relief, and his consciousness was ableto expand again. So the movement is one of concentration, followed byrelaxation.I began trying, just as an exercise, to make this work by imagination alone. Iconcentrated hard, then relaxed and allowed myself to ‘expand’. And I soondiscovered that if I kept on doing this, the effect was a feeling of strain, asif I was expanding and contracting some muscle behind the eyes. But as this‘muscle’ began to feel tired, further effort would produce the peak experience.I was, as it were, producing Greene’s Russian roulette effect in slow motion.The simplest way to do it, I discovered, is to hold up a pen against a blankwall, then concentrate hard until you see nothing but the pen. Then relax theattention so you become aware of the wall. Then concentrate again. I usuallyfind that ten or twelve efforts of concentration release the peak experience.And then I saw that this is the answer to creating a new form of existentialismwhich avoids the pessimism of Sartre and Camus and the nihilism that so many‘Outsiders’ suffer from. If consciousness is ‘intentional’, you can simply makeit more intentional by that act of focusing.But how? Are you supposed to sit and concentrate until you go red in the face?The answer came to me one day when I was about to travel to London on the nighttrain. As a typical Cancer, I love my home and hate travel, and the thought ofthe effort involved depressed me.Moreover, Joy and I had been invited out to dinner that evening. Our host wasthe owner of a house at nearby Porthpean, where a spectacular murder had takenplace. In November 1952, 26-year-old Miles Giffard, the son of well-offmiddle-class parents (his father was the clerk of the court) had become angryand frustrated when his father had refused to let him borrow the car to drive toLondon to see his girlfriend. When his father came home, Miles went down to thegarage and hit him on the head with an iron pipe, battering in his skull. Thenhe went to the kitchen and killed his mother in the same way. He lifted theirbodies into a wheelbarrow, took them to the top of the cliff, and threw themoff, hoping they would be carried out by the tide. Then he drove to London andspent the weekend with his girlfriend. The bodies were soon found, and Miles wasarrested. The jury found him guilty and he was hanged.The current owner of the murder house, which was now called Blue Waters, hadasked us to dinner. After that, Joy had to drive me to the night train.As I was thinking gloomily about this prospect, it suddenly occurred to me thatthis was absurd. Before The Outsider had been published, I would have regardedmyself as very fortunate to go to dinner to look at a murder scene then to go toLondon by sleeper.As soon as I recognised this, I saw the answer: that I had to stop feelingunwilling and reluctant, and put a certain effort and enthusiasm into going todinner, then to London. And that is precisely what I did. As we left our houseto go to Blue Waters, I summoned energy and prepared to enjoy myself – which Idid. Then I went to London in the same frame of mind. Everything went well, andI returned the following evening feeling as if I had been on holiday. I had madethe trip enjoyable by simply doubling the effort I put into it.This was, of course, a logical extension of what I had been doing all my life,since the ‘suicide’ attempt at sixteen. This had obviously been my own versionof Greene’s Russian roulette experience, looking ‘into the pit’ and beingsuddenly overwhelmed with the ecstasy of being alive. As I stood there, holdingthe cyanide bottle, I became two people, the ‘real me’ and the frustratedadolescent. The problem, I then saw, was to learn to transfer my centre ofconsciousness to the ‘real me’, and to recognise the adolescent as an imposter.Thereafter, I never took my miseries too seriously, aware that my ‘sufferings’were basically a kind of confidence trick.I had grasped that same insight when I was thrown out of the RAF – the sheer joyof walking along that sunlit ‘Roman road to Wendover, by Tring and Lilly Hoo’,and knowing then that if it was a choice between Rabelais and Eliot’s ‘HollowMen’, I would choose Rabelais every time.The same thing happened when my first wife, Betty, told me she was not pregnant;and again when Joy told me she was not pregnant in Teignmouth. And as soon as Igrasped what Husserl meant by saying that consciousness is ‘intentional’, Iunderstood that there is something absurd in waiting for ‘peak experiences’ toarrive; they could be induced by an act of concentration and reflection. This iswhat I grasped so clearly after we lost Sally in Cheltenham. Indeed, a few yearslater, I happened to be describing this incident to my literary agent as wewalked on a Cornish beach, and as I reached the conclusion of the story, myscalp suddenly tingled with a sense of pure joy as if I was re-living theexperience of finding her.The principle involved here is an interesting one, and I recognised it againwhen I was next in California. I had been invited to lecture at a place calledthe Esalen Institute, which was on the coast near Big Sur, and which had hot andcold springs. These ran into two huge stone tubs, each about five feet high. Onewas full of steaming hot mineral water, the other of ice-cold water.As I came in, I saw a man heaving himself out of the hot tub, and then loweringhimself, without apparent discomfort, into the cold tub.I said: ‘My God, how do you manage to do that?’He said: ‘It’s a perfectly simple trick. Your body can’t really tell thedifference between very hot water and very cold water. So as you lower yourselfinto the cold tub, you tell yourself that this is deliciously hot.’I tried it and it worked. As I lowered myself into the cold tub, I told myselfthat this was as hot as the other. And my body was convinced, and relaxed in thecold water as happily as in the hot.This is not some form of confidence trick. That experience of losing Sally inCheltenham had taught me that we always have a thousand reasons for happiness,and that misery and depression are basically a form of self-indulgence. If somegod had offered to return Sally on condition I walked to the North Pole andback, I would have agreed without hesitation, feeling it was a good bargain. Several decades later, I learned that a remarkable man of genius called SydBanks had stumbled upon these insights, and that they had become the basis of anew psychology created by an American psychiatrist named George Pransky.Banks is neither an academic nor a psychiatrist; he is an ordinary working man.And the dazzling insight that struck him one day happened in the followingmanner. He had remarked to a friend that he was feeling unhappy, and the friendreplied: ‘You’re not unhappy, Syd – you just think you are.’ Banks stared at himin amazement and said: ‘Do you realise what you’ve just said?’The insight that had dazzled him was that all our psychological problems arisefrom our thoughts, and that we can make them go away by changing our thoughts.Maslow would have said that pessimists do not have peak experiences because theyare pessimists. Optimists do have peak experiences because they are optimists.Banks was so stunned by this insight that he began giving lectures about it.Soon, he was giving seminars that were crowded with professional men – doctors,businessmen, psychiatrists.George Pransky, who like Maslow had begun to feel disillusioned about Freud,went along to a weekend seminar, and at first could not understand what SydBanks meant when he said that all our problems are caused by our thoughts. Buthe observed that the people at the conference all seemed full of energy andoptimism – that they were all ‘copers’ who were in charge of their lives. Andwhen he understood what Banks was saying, he suddenly began to share thefeeling. He went on to apply these insights to his patients, and found that theyworked. Pransky has created a psychology that is based on the peak experience.This is Husserl’s ‘intentionality’ in action. It is the recognition that themind itself dictates most of our feelings and responses. We induce most of ourown misery.Intentionality can be used to create what I have labelled ‘holidayconsciousness’, that wide-awake sense of reality that is of the same nature asProust’s ‘moments bienheureux’ and Chesterton’s ‘absurd good news’, the suddenjoyful recognition that the mind itself can transform and control all ourfeelings and reactions.Gurdjieff aimed at inducing this high level of control in his followers, as canbe seen from a story told by J. B. Bennett in his autobiography, Witness (1974).In the autumn of 1923, Bennett went to stay at the Prieuré at Fontainebleau,where Gurdjieff had set up his Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man.Everyone was expected to work extremely hard: building walls, digging thegarden, and performing the incredibly complex ‘movements’ devised by Gurdjieff.One morning Bennett woke up shaking with fever. Just as he was telling himself,‘I will stay in bed today,’ he found himself impelled to get up, ‘with a queersense of being held together by a superior will’. In spite of exhaustion – dueto dysentery – he joined a group being directed by Gurdjieff in some new andvery complicated exercises. One by one, the others dropped out, but Bennett felthe was being willed to continue by Gurdjieff, even if it killed him.Then, quite suddenly, ‘I was filled with an influx of an immense power. My bodyseemed to have turned into light.’ All weariness and pain had vanished.To test this power he went into the fierce afternoon sun and began to dig at apace he could not normally have maintained for more than a few minutes, andcontinued for more than an hour. ‘My weak, rebellious, suffering body had becomestrong and obedient.’He recalled something that Ouspensky had once said: some people believe they canbe angry or pleased at will, but to grasp our limitations we only have to try tobe astonished. ‘Instantly, I was overwhelmed with amazement … Each tree was souniquely itself that I felt I could walk in the forest forever and never ceasefrom wonderment. Then the thought of “fear” came to me. At once I was shakingwith terror … I thought of joy, and I felt that my heart would burst fromrapture … The word “love” came to me, and I was pervaded with such fine shadesof tenderness and compassion that I saw that I had not the remotest idea of thedepth and range of love … After a time it became too much for me … I wanted tobe free from this power to feel whatever I chose, and at once it left me.’But I have left to the end one of the most important parts of the story. On hiswalk in the forest Bennet meet Gurdjieff, who told him that what he wasexperiencing was ‘Higher Emotional Energy’. And he added that ‘there are somepeople … who are connected to a Great Reservoir or Accumulator of this energy.’And such people – Gurdjieff implied he was one of them – can connect others tothe Great Reservoir.I suspect I achieved some very slight contact with this reservoir on my driveback from Sheepwash."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14> PHILOSOPHY AND DIRTY BOOKSThe years between my return from America in late 1961 and my next trip there inJanuary 1966 were a period of non-stop work. We were living off an overdraft allthat time, and I wrote hard to keep the bank manager from bouncing cheques.Apart from chronic shortage of cash, I had no real cause for complaint. I adoredmy family, and was living in a pleasant home overlooking the sea. I could spendthe morning working, then go to the beach and sunbathe and swim, then returnhome and open a bottle of wine.As I have watched other writers’ marriages fall apart, I have realised thatmeeting Joy was perhaps the best piece of luck of my life. Her gentle, easygoingnature made me feel immensely protective towards her, just as I was protectivetowards Sally – and, later, towards my sons. We had a record about the FlopsyBunnies with a song that went: > We’re a happy family> Yes, a happy family> And we live at the foot> Of the big fir tree …and I never heard it without thinking: Yes, we are a happy family. So I wastedno time in worrying about why we were always so broke, although I sometimessuspected fate did it to me to thwart my natural laziness. As long as we couldscrape along, being in perpetual overdraft didn’t seem to matter much.On Blackpool pier, a fortune teller looked at my palm and said: ‘You’ll never berich, but you’ll never be really short of money.’ So far, she has proved right.One day Gollancz wrote to me, suggesting that the only way to disarm thehostility of the critics (who continued to pan my books) was to stop writing fora few years. He suggested that I should find myself a job – perhaps with apublisher, or perhaps an academic post – and learn to live on a lower income.The thought made my heart sink – I had spent years working at jobs I hated, andwas determined not to become a wage slave again. As I re-read the letter, myspirits plunging deeper into depression, Sally laughed from the next bedroom,and my gloom vanished. So long as I had my wife and my daughter, nothing couldworry me deeply.Of course, the greatest blessing was the sense of freedom. This would descendquite suddenly, and fill me with a wild feeling of delight. I recall drivingback from London with Joy, and stopping off at a pub near Stonehenge to have asandwich and a glass of beer (in those days, pubs did not sell wine by theglass). Sitting outside at a wooden table in the sunlight, I realised howimmensely lucky I was to be there instead of in a factory or office. Since I hadexpected to spend my whole life working for someone else, mere lack of moneyseemed a triviality.Of course, I spent far too much on books and records. In July 1961 I note that Ihad 5,000 books and 1,500 records in the house. By 1963, I had 10,000 books and4,000 records. Today I have about 25,000 books and the same number of records.This probably goes a long way towards explaining why we never had any money.It also explains why I wrote so much. For example, in 1960 I wrote in recordtime a novel that appeared as Adrift in Soho. This had started as acollaboration with an old Soho friend named Charles Belchier, a good-lookingactor with a voice so seductive that he could charm a girl into bed in half anhour.We had not been close friends in my Soho days, for Charles, like so many actors,was uninterested in ideas, so we had little in common. But after The Outsidercame out, he contacted me, and came to stay with us on several occasions. And heasked my help finding a publisher for an unfinished autobiographical book calledThe Other Side of Town.As soon as I read it I saw that it was unpublishable in its present form – itwas too short, and had no development. But the fragment fascinated me.Charles described waking at nine o’clock on a rainy morning in a disused cinemawhere he has spent the night sleeping on the floor with a girl, going outsideand watching the people hurrying past to work, and feeling a delightedsuperiority in the fact that he is free, and can spend the day as he likes. Hesteals a bottle of milk from a doorstep and drinks it instead of breakfast, thengoes off in search of enough money to buy himself lunch …For about a week I tried to rewrite it as a novel, then suddenly realised that Icould not write the book from behind Charles’s eyes, so to speak; I had to putmyself into it. So it turned into a story about a provincial youth who, likemyself, has worked as a navvy in an attempt to avoid office work, and who goesto London in search of a more interesting life. There he makes the acquaintanceof this handsome, smooth-talking actor, who makes a living by sketching peoplein Soho pubs and entertaining theatre queues.I soon used up all Charles’s plot, and decided to extend it with bits of my playThe Metal Flower Blossom. But even so, I ran out of inspiration after anotherten thousand words. I finally sent it to Gollancz and asked his advice. To mydelight – and Charles’s – he decided to publish it exactly as it stood, withoutbothering with an ending. I gave Charles a third of the advance, and Adrift inSoho came out in September 1961. Since it seemed an unpretentious little book,most critics gave it good reviews.The remainder of Charles’s story is sad. In the summer of 1968, he wrote to mefrom some island in the Mediterranean, telling me that he had found the perfectway of life, beach-combing, dozing in the sun and smoking pot. Six months or solater, I received a press cutting from his girlfriend: it is from the DailyExpress of 6 December 1968: > A 43-year-old Englishman arrested for peddling dangerous drugs in West Germany> committed suicide in his cell in Heilbronn today. He was named as Charles> Belchier of no fixed address.> He and two associates were arrested after they were found with hashish worth> £1,500 on the black market. Apparently Charles had hanged himself. His girlfriend was convinced that he hadbeen murdered by other smugglers to keep him from talking, and I have to agreethat this is plausible – I feel Charles loved life too much to kill himself. The following year, 1962, saw the publication of the first book about me, TheWorld of Colin Wilson by Sidney Campion. The author was a Leicester man whom Ihad once regarded as a hero and role model.In about 1943, when I was twelve, my father brought home from work a book calledTowards the Mountains by Sidney R. Campion, describing how he had been born in aslum, and worked as a newspaper seller from the age of eleven. When he wasselling newspapers outside the London Road station he had fallen intoconversation with the Labour politician Ramsay MacDonald, who had recognised hisquality, and helped him find work on a local newspaper. Burning with ambition,Sidney was determined to become a great man, and the Prime Minister of England.And although he failed in his political ambitions, he became a barrister and ahigh-ranking civil servant, and was at one point given the OBE and awarded thefreedom of the city of Leicester at a banquet in the Town Hall.It was an amazing story of self-help, and I was thrilled by it. So was mymother; after reading Sidney’s description of how he had obtained a copy of LadyChatterley’s Lover when it was first published, and written a passionate defenceof the book, she immediately borrowed Sons and Lovers from the local library,and became one of Lawrence’s devoted admirers. I also read Lawrence and admiredhim; but I did not think he was half as good as Sidney Campion.About a month after The Outsider came out, my phone rang, and the man on theother end identified himself as Sidney Campion. ‘Not the Sidney Campion?’ Iasked incredulously. And indeed it was. It seemed that the great Leicesterfirebrand was now retired in Wimbledon, carving sculptures as a hobby, andwanted to know if I would sit for him. Naturally, I said yes, and immediatelywrote to my mother to tell her that Sidney Campion, the great Sidney Campion,wanted to carve a bust of me. I think that this was the first time that mymother realised that her son had really ‘arrived’.I made my way down to Wimbledon on the underground, and was mildly surprised tofind that the great Leicester writer was living in an ordinary semi-detached,and was a mild, kindly and deaf old man (in fact, he was younger than I am now)with a perceptible Leicester accent. (I had got rid of mine years before.)He introduced me to his wife, Clare, a plump, grey-haired lady in her sixties,and it took me some time to reconcile her with the woman I remembered so clearlyfrom Sidney’s first volume of autobiography, Sunlight on the Foothills. ForSidney’s description of her had haunted my adolescent fantasies, particularly aphrase about ‘our warm naked bodies entwined in one another’s arms’, and hisadmission that his desire for her was so urgent in those early days of marriagethat he often used to make some excuse to break off work and hurry home duringthe day.Sidney seemed to greatly admire me, and it did not take me long to understandwhy. He felt he had never achieved his lifetime ambition to ‘reach the top’; hehad never become famous. And apparently I had done it with a single book. And aswe sat in his studio on that first occasion, he confided in me that his ambitionwas to write one more book – a biography of me.The idea struck me as slightly absurd – after all, I was only twenty-five. ButSidney had taken to heart Edith Sitwell’s comment that I would one day be a‘truly great writer’, and was determined to be my first chronicler. So he wentup to Leicester, met my mother and father, and returned with a briefcase packedwith my letters home. (He also developed a definite sexual interest in my mother– Sidney was nothing if not young at heart.)But when his typescript finally arrived in the post, I was appalled. Sidney hadwritten the book as if it was a kind of heroic continuation of his own story,and I was portrayed as a cross between Wagner’s Siegfried and Scott’s YoungLochinvar. One sentence described how the teenage Colin Wilson used to cyclearound the lanes of Leicestershire, ‘his long blond hair flying in the wind, hisbeautiful blue eyes blazing with madness’.I had lent Sidney my early journals, written from the age of seventeen to abouttwenty-one. He had devoted a whole chapter to extracts from them, and had chosenwith unerring instinct every bit of overwritten juvenile romanticism.There was another problem: Sidney was no intellectual, and existentialism wasfrankly beyond him. The writers he admired most were Thomas Hardy and D. H.Lawrence, and Sartre was well beyond his range. So his comments on my books wereon a level with a sixth-form essay.I could see there was only one thing to do: settle down and rewrite the wholething. And this I did in a few months of hard work. I carefully kept Sidney’soriginal copy, in case he was tempted to restore some of the purple passages. Iwas unaware that he had a carbon copy.It hardly seemed to matter, since the book was turned down by every publisher towhom he submitted it. But, not to be defeated, Sidney placed an advertisement inThe Times, saying that he had written a biography of me, and it was accepted bythe publisher Frederick Muller. When I saw it in print, I realised that, indeed,Sidney had restored some of the worst purple passages, although fortunately notthe one about my long blond hair flying in the wind.Predictably, it received some harsh reviews. One writer compared Sidney to a dogthat raises its back leg against every lamppost. If I had any serious reputationleft by 1962, The World of Colin Wilson certainly did nothing to improve it.Meanwhile, in the three months after my return from America I had written twobooks – Origins of the Sexual Impulse and a first version of Beyond theOutsider. I worked fast because my brain was seething with ideas.The sex book had been in my head a long time, but I had delayed because I knewthat Gollancz would turn it down, as he had turned down the Encyclopedia ofMurder. He did, but fortunately Arthur Barker publishers, which was a subsidiaryof Weidenfeld and Nicolson, accepted both.The paradoxes of sex had always fascinated me, and the reason becomes obvious onthe first page of The Outsider. Barbusse’s hero looks at the women on top of atramcar, with their skirts lifting gently in the breeze, and realises: ‘It isnot a woman I want – it is all women.’ Every male can understand what he means.Yet when he takes a prostitute back to her room, it feels like a ‘suddenhurtling-down’. He has recognised that purely physical sex is a kind ofconfidence trick.The point had been brought home to me even more clearly by a South African poetcalled Philip de Bruyn. He had sent me the typescript of an autobiography calledA Pagan’s Hosanna, describing his wanderings around the world – San Francisco,Hong Kong, Johannesburg – in search of an elusive ideal of freedom. Like CharlesBelchier, Philip felt that taking a job and settling down is a profoundlyunsatisfying way of life, so he spent years as a kind of tramp – as I had beenprepared to do in my teens.What fascinated me was his search for a sexual ideal. In his book he describedhow he had been lying on an empty beach when a beautiful girl came and changedinto her bikini. Philip lay there, pretending to doze, but actually watching herin a state of wild lust. At the same time, he recognised the element ofabsurdity in his desire. What he wanted was to possess her immediately, withoutpreliminaries. But he knew that this was impossible unless he raped her – andthat even that would have been equally unsatisfying.So he went through the social ritual: engaged her in conversation, took her outfor a meal, and ended by marrying her. I later met his wife; they came andstayed with us, and she was a pretty and agreeable girl. (Philip was lucky toget her, for he was fat and bald headed.) But I could see what he meant. Therewas no way of satisfying that original desire, that craving he had experiencedwhen he first saw her taking off her clothes and changing into her bikini.Now the Marquis de Sade, who had started out in life as a young army officerwith enough money to keep several mistresses, nevertheless recognised that hewas subject to this same ‘metaphysical’ frustration: that there seemed to besomething unattainable about the object of male desire. In the quest forsatisfaction, he soon became addicted to flogging and being flogged, and evenpersuaded women to allow him to make small cuts with a razor and drip hotsealing wax into them.As we read the preposterous sadistic fantasies Sade committed to paper in theBastille (to which he had been consigned by a vengeful mother-in-law) under thetitle of 120 Days of Sodom, we can see that he had become hopelessly lost andconfused. The sexual will o’ the wisp continued to elude him.That is what I wanted to write about in Origins: the attempt to achieve ‘whatthe world’s million lips are searching for’ through sex.What was perfectly clear was that sex tends to drag us off in the wrongdirection. I had been greatly taken with a story told to me by a youngtelevision producer who had come to stay with us. He was upset and miserablebecause the girl he had been living with was a nymphomaniac. She was not onlyunfaithful, but enjoyed telling him about her infidelities.A few days earlier, after a party, she had gone into the cloakroom to collecther coat, and had bent down to adjust the suspenders holding up her stockings.(This was the time when tights were only just coming into fashion.) The doorbehind her opened, but she ignored it and went on adjusting her suspender. Theman who came in raised her dress from behind and pushed his erect penis intoher, then, after he had achieved a climax, withdrew and went out again. And shemade no attempt to look round and see who it was. She preferred not knowing; itsatisfied her craving for ‘sex with a stranger’.Where my producer friend was concerned, this was the final straw, and he hadbroken off with her just before he came down to see me. But what struck me abouthis story was its absurdity. The girl might have found herself pregnant, orsuffering from some sexual disease, without even knowing who was responsible.And all because she found ordinary sex, with its social preliminaries,ultimately unsatisfying. She was expressing the same frustration as Philip deBruyn.It was obvious to me that most sex murderers, from Jack the Ripper to the BostonStrangler (who was operating in the early 60s), were driven by this sameillogical impulse, and this also explains why I have written so much about sexcrime. This was not – as hostile reviewers assumed – because I wanted to makemoney from writing near-pornography, but because it was a logical extension ofthe theme of The Outsider.While I was writing Origins of the Sexual Impulse, I received a letter fromMaurice Girodias, the Paris publisher who specialised in obscene books. When Iwas in Paris in 1953, many British writers – like Alexander Trocchi andChristopher Logue – were eking out a living by writing ‘dirty books’ forGirodias – Trocchi even wrote a fifth volume of Frank Harris’s My Life andLoves. Now Girodias was proposing that I should write a ‘dirty book’ for hisOlympia Press imprint.The idea appealed to me. In 1962, the police were still liable to seize any bookthey considered indecent. And I liked to be allowed to write frankly about sex.I wanted, for example, to be allowed to tell the story of how, when I was aboutseventeen, I had gone to help an acquaintance set up his market stall in a townnear Leicester. His name was Morrie, and he was a master of the art ofmanipulating a crowd. ‘I’m not going to ask you ten pounds for this watch, oreven five pounds – no, not even three pounds. All I want is thirty bob, onepound ten shillings. How about you, sir?’I was standing at the front of the stall, pushed against it by the crowd behindme. And the woman who was pressed against my buttocks was wearing a thin dress,so that I could feel the contours of her thighs and pubis. Naturally, I becameexcited. I cautiously adjusted my erection so it was pressed against the edge ofthe stall, until her slight movements brought me to a climax.In today’s climate of sexual frankness, such an anecdote would not even cause araised eyebrow. But in 1962, it would have been regarded as obscene. These werethe days before Portnoy’s Complaint had broken the taboo about masturbation.So I settled down and wrote a sequel to Ritual in the Dark called The ManWithout a Shadow – this referred to the novel Peter Schlemihl by Chamisso, whosehero loses his shadow. It was a pleasure to write, for I enjoyed telling thestory of my own sex life in a slightly fictionalised form.I liked above all talking about the paradoxes of the sexual impulse. The herodescribes, for example, how he is on his way to spend the night with agirlfriend, and stops at a shop in Kensington High Street to buy her a pair ofstockings. He turns around from the counter, and sees a woman standing in one ofthe changing rooms. She has forgotten to draw the curtain, and is pulling adress over her head. He experiences a surge of sexual desire that makes himgasp. But as he leaves the shop he sees the absurdity of his sexual excitement.The woman is middle-aged, yet he has experienced an intensity of desire that isstronger than anything he will experience watching his girlfriend get undressed.This experience – which had actually happened to me on my way to spend the nightwith Dorothy – was one of many I wanted to be allowed to describe.When I told my publisher, Jim Reynolds of Arthur Barker Ltd, that I was writinga dirty book for Girodias, he asked to be allowed to see it. I sent it to himand, to my surprise, he said he could see no good reason not to publish it inEngland. I was, of course, delighted, since he would give me a far largeradvance than Girodias (who was notoriously mean with his authors).Jim insisted on cutting out only one story. This was something that had happenedto a friend of mine named Austin Pauley, who had worked with me in the PostOffice over Christmas 1955. Pauley, who was unmarried and permanentlysex-starved, had answered one of those advertisements pinned outside a newsagentin Notting Hill – for the kind of lady who advertises herself as an ‘erectionand demolition expert’.When he saw her, he was disappointed; she was completely unattractive. Heundressed and climbed into bed with her, hoping that being at close quarterswould enable him to forget what she looked like. But it was no use; his sexualenergies remained dormant.At that point, she went to a cupboard and removed an apparatus with a largewheel and two long wires. The wires were attached to his penis with adhesivetape. When she turned the wheel, he experienced a series of mild electric shocksthat were pleasantly stimulating. Slowly he reached a state of erection, and shequickly unharnessed him. But the moment he was disconnected, the erectionsubsided. They tried again and again, but each time the hesitant response failedto survive the stimulus, until Pauley was shamefacedly forced to admit defeat.When the book was published, I talked about it on a television programmerecorded in Birmingham. During a camera rehearsal I told the story of Pauley’sfiasco, and the crew roared with laughter, but when we came to make the finalrecording, the producer decided not to risk it.The American publisher who accepted the book preferred to call it The Sex Diaryof Gerard Sorme. Unfortunately, he decided to try to bring it out before theAmerican edition of Origins of the Sexual Impulse, with the result that the twobooks were published in the same month, and were reviewed together, so theykilled one another.After the publication of Philip Roth’s Portnoy’s Complaint in 1967, allinhibitions vanished, and publishers vied with one another to see who couldprovoke a prosecution under the obscene publications act, and so make a fortune.My friend Philip de Bruyn contacted me again, having decided to try and emulatethe example of the Sex Diary.He sent me the result – an obviously autobiographical novel with the curioustitle You Owe me a Tickey, Arona Cronje, Arona Cronje being a girlfriend who hadbet him that he would never dare to tell the whole truth about his sex life.Philip won, and the novel was probably the most appallingly frank confession Ihave ever read. I thought my own sex drive was fairly strong, but Philip made mefeel like a eunuch. His life had been a non-stop pursuit of sex whose objectsranged from six to sixty, the six-year-old being someone whose parents assumedhe was a trustworthy babysitter.Philip had also been, like me, a devoted underwear fetishist, but his quest ofsatisfaction had been rather more determined than my own. He described how hehad once crawled on all fours into a bedroom where two men and two women wereasleep, picked up a pair of panties in his teeth, and had been crawling outagain when one of the women woke up and screamed. Philip was beaten up by thetwo men.Philip wanted me to help him find him a publisher, and I wrote him anIntroduction. I asked my secretary to read the novel and give me her opinion onwhether it could be published. She said she thought it was the filthiest bookshe had ever read, and that no publisher would dare risk it. My American agentagreed with her. And when I recently reread my Introduction, I suddenlyremembered what was wrong with the novel: the relentless sexual obsession,continuing for chapter after chapter, finally makes the reader feel physicallysoiled, as if he has been rolling in a pig sty.Since I wrote the Introduction, in 1975, I had often wondered what became ofPhilip. I learned the answer from a correspondent a year ago, who told me Philiphad died in the mid-90s.Reading Philip’s ‘novel’ had again made me aware of this fundamental problem ofhuman sexuality. Why do most of us find sex the most fascinating thing in theworld? Clearly because it can cause a state of focused attention that seems tofree us from the domination of the robot. But Philip made the mistake ofthinking that the more sex you got, the more freedom you experienced; and thisis simply untrue. Without that obsessive concentration, sex can become asunexciting as eating egg and bacon. The mind relapses into its familiar state ofsleep.When Ouspensky asked Gurdjieff how we can cease to be machines, Gurdjieff toldhim:‘If you understood everything you have read in your life, you would already knowwhat you are looking for now. If you understood everything you have written inyour own book [he meant Tertium Organum], I should come and bow to you and begyou to teach me. But you do not understand …’And now, as I was struggling with a final version of Beyond the Outsider, Iwondered if this was true of me. Did I understand everything I had written in myown book?Aldous Huxley had described his own experiment with the drug mescalin, and thestunning sense of reality he experienced. Now I was writing a chapter aboutSartre’s experience of the drug – when he had the hallucination of beingfollowed by a gigantic lobster – and comparing it with Aldous Huxley’ssemi-mystical experience. When I had first met Huxley in the Athenaeum, he hadadvised me to try mescalin. Now, three years later, I decided to follow hisadvice.Mescalin was not, at that time, a banned substance, but I had no idea of how togo about buying some. Fortunately, a psychologist friend, John Comley, wrote meout a prescription for a gram of mescalin sulphate, and told me where to obtainit.It came in the post a week later, a tiny quantity of white powder in a sealedtube; I think it cost me £5. I decided to try it the following day.The evening before, I read Huxley’s The Doors of Perception again, and had astrong intuition that taking mescalin would be pointless for me. My own mostpowerful ‘peak experiences’ had been moods of intense optimism, the feeling thatthe basic answer to the problem of human existence lies in will anddetermination.All the same, it seemed absurd to buy the drug and then not use it. So at abouthalf past nine on the morning of 18 July 1963, I took about a quarter of a gramdissolved in water. It tasted like Epsom salts.An hour later, nothing had happened, so I took about another quarter of a gram.Still no effect, except that I began to feel rather hot and oppressed. So Idecided to take a walk. It was a dull morning with rain in the air, and I soonbegan to feel more oppressed. I stopped to talk to a friend who said she wassuffering from a hangover, and I felt much the same.When I came home the world seemed oddly distant, and I made myself sick bypushing my fingers down my throat. I could taste the mescalin as it came up. Isat with sweat on my forehead, cursing myself for a fool and feeling as if I hadtaken poison. I drank a glass of water, lay down on the bed, and made myselfsick again. All I wanted now was for the filthy stuff to wear off.For half an hour I lay there, feeling feverish. Joy came in several times to seeif I was all right, but I asked her to go away because I simply felt ill. I hadto suppress panic, and to tell myself that no one had ever been harmed bymescalin, but as the room seemed to shrink and become hotter, it was hard tostay calm.I dozed, and felt better when I woke up. Now I could tell something washappening inside me. The varnished door seemed to glow prismatically and arrangeitself in patterns. But this was the only visual effect. I did not, like Huxley,see everything as immensely real. (He had said that a deckchair with red andgreen stripes looked as if it was made of red and green fire.)I felt hugely weary, and out of control. Then I noticed there was a wonderfulsweetness flowing through my body, erotic and yet very innocent. (I actuallytried, as an experiment, giving myself an erection, but could only manage itbriefly, as if I had been drinking heavily.) It was like kissing Joy or Sally. Icould also see why Marilyn Monroe exerts such an attraction on males – becauseshe exudes the same mixture of eroticism and innocence. I felt rather like amother breastfeeding a baby, or a sow feeding a whole farrow. It was like beingin bed with a very loving – and insatiable – female, who is also an idiot.As a child I disliked being kissed and petted, and now I reacted in the sameaway. I had always tended to be attracted by rather innocent girls, and now itfelt as though I was in bed with all of them at once, and they were all saying,‘We love you.’ And it was as if I was replying: ‘I know. But now let me alone. Iwant to think.’I felt guilty about my present situation. It was true that I now knew the worldto be basically good. But I was a husband and a father; I had to protect Joy andSally. Therefore I couldn’t simply relax into the mescalin experience. I had tokeep my wits about me. This feeling of being lapped in a sea of universal lovewas debilitating, rather like an orgasm that tricked on indefinitely. It was asif I was lying on a floating bed on a gently undulating sea. All this love wasrather like having a large dog putting its paws on my shoulders and licking myface, and I wanted to grimace and push it away.Joy brought me some soup, and I asked her to cook me a lamb chop. But I wasunable to eat more than a mouthful. It was underdone, and I was too aware thatit had been a lamb.This triggered a bad phase of the experience. I recalled the scene in The MagicMountain where Hans Castorp falls asleep in the snow and dreams of a beautifulisland like one of those glowing paintings of Claude Lorraine; then this givesway to a vision of two horrible old crones tearing a baby apart. I rememberfeeling: drugs are all very well, but who is going to stop things like thishappening unless I do it? The curious rhythm running through my head and down mybody made me think that this is how Joy must have felt when she was havingSally: the need to push.I was seething with peculiar psychic forces, and I recalled a psychic friendtelling me that she was invaded by strange insights when she was in a state ofnervous exhaustion. She had once stopped outside a fishmonger’s hung with deadrabbits, and suddenly felt the panic of the rabbits as they were killed. It madeher feel sick.I now felt rather the same – as if I was in a telephone exchange with messagescoming from all around me, as if I had accidentally got into telepathic contactwith the whole district. Oddly enough, I felt that this part of Cornwall isstrongly connected with witchcraft. (I have never tried to find if this istrue.)It was mid-afternoon, and Joy told me she was taking Sally to the vicarage fête.I decided to go with her to try to throw off the effects of the mescalin. Andgradually, to my immense relief, the sensations started to wear off. At thefête, in a garden, I noticed that the scent of flowers was intensified, and thatwhen I drank some water, it tasted thick and slimy, almost like glycerine.By the time I went to bed, I was feeling normal again. But for weeks afterwards,it could come back in a brief flash, like a door being opened and fairgroundmusic coming out. Eating radishes could also bring it back – a sinking feeling,as if I was walking on a frozen pond and the ice suddenly broke.When I looked back on it later, I could see that I had been right in thinkingthat I didn’t need the mescalin vision. I already accepted that the universe isbasically good. To be flooded with this feeling seemed unnecessary. It was likeplacing your hands under a tap for a drink of water, and being knocked off yourfeet by a tremendous gush.Huxley had mentioned Henri Bergson’s theory that our senses are not intended tolet things in so much as to keep them out. They are filters. And mescalin hadremoved the filters.When I am working, my mind is like a searchlight beam that can pick out andilluminate ideas. When I am very interested or excited, the beam seems to narrowuntil it has the power of a laser. Mescalin had caused my beam to widen, ratherlike those torches where you can control the beam by twisting the lens.To use another analogy, my mind is like a radio with a VHF system, so I can tunein to stations that are difficult to obtain. Mescalin had destroyed this system,so I was receiving half a dozen stations at the same time.Now I could understand why Sartre had had such a bad trip, and Huxley such agood one. Mescalin immobilises the filters that keep reality at arm’s length.The effect is rather like waking up on a train and finding a stranger with hisface within an inch of your own. The effect is one of shock. If, like Sartre,you basically mistrust the universe, your response is to scream. If, likeHuxley, you trust the universe, then your response is one of wonder and delight.Mescalin had made me aware of my own basic trust. And it had the same effect onCharles Belchier, who ingested the remains of my mescalin sulphate when he camedown on a visit. He spent the next few hours repeating, ‘I feel wonderful!’Evidently he had enjoyed the feeling of universal love which I had found ratherstifling, like being embraced by an affectionate fat lady. When I put on arecord of Wagner’s Tristan, he burst into tears of joy.Laura del Rivo, on the other hand, had a mescalin experience that was more likeSartre’s. ‘I was eating a pear, and suddenly noticed that its flesh was composedof granules. Where I had bitten, the granules were writhing like bisectedmaggots and bleeding pus. The whole thing was organic; it revolted me. I turnedthe pear and regarded it from an oblique angle; now it heaved and writhed likelarvae. I could not stop looking at it; I was hypnotised by disgust.’Laura’s novel The Furnished Room reveals this same negative feeling aboutreality, a sense of depression. But then, Laura had always struck me as slightlydepressive. When I once spoke to her about my own sense of underlying meaning,she replied that it was surely self-evident that reality was meaningless.Her attitude fascinates me, for it raises the question of how one can learn to‘see’ meaning. She admits that the mescalin experience had a long-term effect onher by way of general depression and abnormal behaviour. ‘I did not like writingthis account … I do not like thinking of those years at all; the ice is so thin;it is easy to fall again into the terrible depression.’This is the place to say something about Laura’s subsequent career. I wascurious to see how she would develop after The Furnished Room, which isbrilliant, dark-coloured, and full of almost Sartrean negativity. Her secondnovel was called Animals – although her publisher insisted on changing it to theirritatingly sentimental Daffodil on the Pavement. The heroine, Maggie, is morethan a touch autobiographical; the hero, Jacob, ‘talks like an ideas machine’.(Laura admitted that it is a partial portrait of me.)Although full of ironic observation and striking images (‘A blizzard of gullswheeled’), it is depressingly static, like a series of still-lifes. The readerwants something to happen, to be told a story, but the writer obviously has nostory to tell. So the end seems to peter out.In the 1980s, after more than a decade of silence, she wrote one more strikingwork, a novella called Speedy and Queen Kong, stylistically her most brilliantso far. ‘Speedy was poor but dishonest … A changeling, he could only imperfectlymimic human behaviour. He sent another charge of electricity through the uneventufts of the hair that were wired to his skull. Small horns of smoke rose fromhis temples. Then he extinguished; went out. His tongue lolled on his lip. Hewas disconnected.’Speedy is a schizophrenic youth, the lover of a vast lady called Queen Kong, wholounges around all day in her underwear, watching television, eating chocolatebiscuits and custard-pie cakes, and waiting for her lover to arrive and providesexual satisfaction. At the end of the book he escapes from a mental home anddrops dead in a field. Queen Kong expresses her grief by wrecking the café whereSpeedy used to spend most of his time, and no one dares to stop her. The bookhas a strange, manic nihilism reminiscent of the American Nathanael West, whoseHollywood novel The Day of the Locust seems to be driven by the same boredom anddisgust.By the time she wrote it, Laura was supporting herself running a second-handclothes stall in Portobello market, and the book is full of the bustle andvitality of market traders and con-men, and the grotesque antics of drugaddicts, bums and layabouts. But even this cannot save it from conveying anultimate sense of futility.Laura’s problem is analogous to Graham Greene’s. In the account of his Russianroulette experience, he says of his teens: ‘For years … I could take noaesthetic interest in anything visual at all; staring at a sight that othersassured me was beautiful, I would feel nothing. I was fixed in my boredom.’ Butthe Russian roulette galvanised his consciousness out of this passivity, andmade him aware that ‘the world is infinitely exciting’ – an insight heapparently forgot immediately. He would have found the mescalin experience ashorrifying as Laura did.My own mescalin experience brought me an insight into the solution. It lies inmy concept of the ‘robot’.You might say that, for everyday purposes, we are all 50 per cent ‘robot’, and50 per cent what you might call ‘real you’. When we become tired, we become 51per cent robot and only 49 per cent ‘real you’. If I become run-down anddepressed, I become 52 per cent or 53 per cent robot.More than that is extremely dangerous, for if you slip down to a level at whichyou become 55 per cent robot, and only 45 per cent ‘real you’, the real you isso immobilised by automatism that it is very difficult to fight back and recoversome degree of freedom.Now Maslow’s ‘peakers’ were energetic people who found it easy to become 51 percent ‘real them’. When I was driving back from Sheepwash through the snow, sheerconcentration and urgency led me to push myself into a state of 52 per cent or53 per cent ‘real me’.Once you have had peak experiences, they are easy to recover because you onlyhave to recall that curious sense of optimism to suddenly feel it. You realisethat half the peak experience lies in the intentionality of consciousness, in abasically active attitude towards the world.One of Maslow’s students was working his way through college as a drummer in ajazz band, and described how, at two o’clock one morning, he found himselfdrumming so perfectly that he went into the peak experience. He had, so tospeak, contacted some profoundly natural rhythm of his body, which enabled himto become aware of great powers in his own depths. And the memory of thesepowers, the recognition of their reality, would trigger a sense of optimism –and more peak experiences.So by the mid-60s, I was aware that the chief danger for ‘Outsiders’ is tosurrender to a sense of passivity. And that, I could see, had been the mainproblem of my American lecture tour: allowing fatigue and a sense of repetitionto undermine my vitality and allow me to slip into a state in which I becamemore ‘robot’ than ‘real me’.My second lecture tour of America in 1966 gave me a chance to put this insightinto practice."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15> ON THE ROADWhen I left for America in early January 1966, I was thoroughly depressed. Thethought of leaving Joy and Sally – and our new baby, John Damon – made my heartsink. As a result, I had drunk rather too much the evening before I left, andclimbed on to the train suffering from a hangover.The weather was unseasonably warm for January, and British Rail had turned onthe heating, so I sat in the carriage perspiring and trying to catch the breezefrom the wide open window.Ninety minutes into the journey we passed through Teignmouth, and I recalled –as I always did – how Joy had thought she might be pregnant on our holiday in1954, and how she had told me in Teignmouth that her period had started. And Irecalled my enormous relief, and how I had thought: the sea is beautiful, thenthought: no it’s not – you’re just relieved, and then suddenly realised thatthis was not true – that the sea and the Exmouth peninsula were beautiful, andmy relief had simply drawn back the veils from my perceptions and enabled me tosee what was actually there.And now, sitting alone in an overheated carriage, I felt a kind of rage. If thesea was beautiful, why could I not see this now? I twisted my face into agrimace of concentration, and exerted all my will power. If anyone had beenwatching me, they would have thought I was having an epileptic seizure.After a few minutes there was an odd feeling inside my head, as if heavy doorswere being pulled back, and the sea suddenly exploded into beauty. I knowprecisely how long this took, for since then I have often timed the distancefrom Teignmouth station to Dawlish, and it is about two minutes.During the rest of that journey to London, all my tiredness had vanished, and Ifelt wide awake, with the feeling that I could draw upon immense reserves ofvitality. I decided that I would give up drinking for a few weeks. It seemedimportant to try to preserve this sense of mental clarity.A few hours later I caught my plane at Heathrow, and landed in New York atIdlewild – now John F. Kennedy – airport which was covered in snow. I took a cabto Grand Central Station, and there caught a train to a place calledHastings-on-Hudson, where I was going to see a mathematician named MartinGardner, who wrote the Mathematical Recreations column for the ScientificAmerican.I had written to him about a geometrical problem involving a triangle inscribedin a circle, and we had corresponded ever since. I knew him as the author of anamusing book called Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, which takes asavagely sceptical view of rebels like Wilhelm Reich, and anyone else whoquestions strict scientific orthodoxy. I had, I must admit, been a littleirritated by its tone of omniscience, and wondered if the author would be asintolerant as he sounded. In fact, he proved to be charming – I described him toJoy as ‘a cross between Sidney Campion and old Raymond Duncan’ – and somethingof a mystic. I would have found it hard to credit that within a year or two hewould be attacking me violently as a woolly-minded enemy of science.Waiting for me at Martin Gardner’s was a letter from my lecture agency, ColstonLeigh. It stated that I would have guaranteed earnings of $7,500 in ten weeks, asubstantial amount since I was glad to get a $5,000 advance on a book. Thisgreatly cheered me, since I had left Joy with a pile of debts.A few hours later I arrived at the first stop on my itinerary, the University ofBridgewater. As I strolled out to the post office the following morning, in anicy wind that made my face feel like rubber, I was charmed by the quiet Americantown, with its wide roads, white clapboard houses, and Christmas trees on thelawns. (It would have interested me deeply to know that the Bridgewater Statemental institution at present housed Albert DeSalvo, the Boston Strangler;DeSalvo had only just confessed his murders to the lawyer F. Lee Bayley.)I lectured at 10.30 that morning to a flatteringly enthusiastic audience, whichled me to consider whether I might not be better off making a living as alecturer. I was still thinking about this as I caught a bus to my next port ofcall, New Hampton College in New Hampshire.My first impressions of this place were unfavourable. I learned that I was beingpaid only $350 for two days, and that I was expected to teach class for fivehours as well as lecture in the evening. Since my lecture agent was taking halfthe fee, this was far from generous.In fact, my hosts were charming, and when I enquired if there was a localbarber’s shop, the wife of one of the professors offered to cut my hair for me.As I was sitting in her home with a towel round my neck, I commented on thevolumes of C. S. Lewis on the bookshelf, whereupon she told me an anecdote abouthim. In 1952, her closest friend was a woman named Joy Davidman, and when Joy’smarriage broke up, she had announced: ‘I’m going to England to marry C. S.Lewis.’ The astonished lady asked: ‘When did he ask you?’ ‘He hasn’t,’ said Joy,‘but he will.’ ‘But do you know him?’ ‘No, but we’ve exchanged a couple ofletters.’So Joy called on Lewis in Oxford – a bachelor and confirmed misogynist – andmarried him just as she said she would. Telling Joy (my Joy) about this in aletter, I commented that it just shows that a determined woman can get anythingshe sets her mind on.The professor’s wife also made a comment that I took care not to report to Joy –that I was getting fat. Indeed, that thought had occurred to me. Ever since Ihad stopped growing, I had weighed eleven stone – 154 pounds – and thatcontinued for year after year. I was six feet tall, and had a thin face withhigh cheekbones – rather like Una Troubridge’s bust of Nijinsky. Joy told methis was one of the reasons she was attracted to me – the slavic cheekbones. Fora year or so after The Outsider came out, my weight remained unchanged, in spiteof good food and a daily intake of wine. Then, slowly, it increased to twelve,then thirteen, stones – 182 pounds. My increasing girth disturbed me, but I wastall enough to carry it without looking podgy. No one had ever remarked on it inEngland, but the professor’s wife, as a health-conscious American, felt sheought to warn me. I resolved to give it some thought when I returned to England.But it was not for this reason that the little Connecticut town of New Hamptonbecame literally a turning point in my life.That evening, after my lecture, I was invited to a party at the house of one ofthe professors, and there was introduced to a thin, sandy-haired man with asouthern accent and a flamboyant personality. You could not be in a room withhim, no matter how large and crowded, without knowing he was there. He was awriter named Calder Willingham and, apart from Grace Metalious, he was thebest-known literary celebrity of the area. Calder had become famous in 1947,when he was twenty-five, for a novel called End as a Man. Mailer’s Naked and theDead had appeared in the same year, and both authors had become instantcelebrities.Calder’s novel was about a military academy, with emphasis on brutal bullyingand homosexuality, and a film version ten years later had been equallysuccessful. Since then, Calder had made a good living as a screen writer. (Hislater credits would include The Graduate and Little Big Man.) In 1962, his novelEternal Fire had been denounced by some critics as obscene.The antihero of this work was apparently a sexual athlete called Harry Diadem,who seduces and rapes his way through the novel with the panache of a Casanova.And naturally, the book was one of the main subjects of discussion that evening.As I arrived, Calder was telling the story of how a nymphomaniac Hollywood agenthad read Eternal Fire, and told Calder’s agent – while Calder listened in overan extension – that the book should be burned and the author castrated. (Hisagent later told Calder of how he had been in a restaurant with the lady, andhow she had proposed that they return to her flat, meanwhile reaching under thetablecloth and removing his penis from his trousers.)Later that evening, as he drove me back to my guest room, our host told me thatCalder had recently turned down a job as Writer-in-Residence at a girls’college. Since I had promised to drop in on Calder before I caught my plane thenext day, I decided to mention it. When I told him that I was trying to findmyself a job as Writer-in-Residence, Calder immediately picked up the phone, andrang Hollins College in Virginia. ‘I’ve got a British writer called Colin Wilsonhere with me. Is that job still open?’ He put his hand over the phone and said:‘Did you write Hemlock and After?’ Ignoring my disclaimer he said: ‘Yes, hedid.’ He handed the phone to me. ‘You speak to him.’The professor at the other end asked: ‘Are you married?’ I said I was. ‘Do youexpect to publish anything next year?’ I said I had about four books in theworks. ‘Fine. Can you start in September? We pay $12,000 for the year, andtravelling expenses for you and your family. You get a house on campus.’When I hung up a moment later I was a professor at $6,000 a semester.I shook hands warmly with Calder, and went off to my eleven o’clock class. Atlunchtime I telegraphed Joy to tell her that we would be travelling to Americain August.Later that day, as I travelled through the snow-bound New England countryside, Iwas bubbling with euphoria. It seemed marvellous that I would be bringing Joy tolive in America. After the non-stop grind of the past five years, life seemed tobe opening up.I picked up a copy of Calder’s Eternal Fire at the first opportunity. It came asquite a shock. The nymphomaniac Hollywood agent was by no means entirely wrong.This was a pretty nasty book.Its sixth chapter had been printed in Playboy, and describes a bus journey inwhich Harry Diadem seduces a teenage girl. She is an innocent virgin, but asthey spend the night petting on the back seat, he ends with her panties in hispocket, and the girl has several orgasms. She is on her way to a religiousconvention, but feels there is no harm in petting. And when Harry tells her thathe is deeply religious, and is at that moment praying for his sick grandmother,the girl is ready to trust him with her life.Harry skilfully lures her into a bedroom at a coach stop – telling the hotelproprietor that his pregnant wife needs to lie down – and then rapes her. Andhaving done it once, he makes her strip, takes off his own clothes, and does itagain. Then they board the bus, with the girl in tears, asking him if he willkeep his promise to marry her.I could see why the nymphomaniac lady was outraged. There is something cold andbrutal about the whole chapter, the implication that Harry is merely exercisinghis rights as a healthy male to seduce teenage girls. And the male reader isexpected to sympathise. Calder had described how, at a local party, arespectable academic had asserted drunkenly: ‘I am Harry Diadem. You are HarryDiadem. We’re all’ – gesturing drunkenly round the room – ‘Harry Diadem.’Now as far as I was concerned, this was definitely untrue. Harry Diadem was adisgusting male chauvinist pig, and revealed an unpleasant sadistic streak inhis creator. (In that respect, his next novel, Providence Island, was just asbad, about a man who is shipwrecked on a desert island with a clergyman’s wifeand a butch lesbian, and persuades both of them to surrender to his irresistablemale dominance.)Later, I would ask my boss at Hollins College: ‘What were you thinking of,asking Calder Willingham to be Writer-in-Residence? You’d have had half theparents withdrawing their daughters,’ to which he replied: ‘Oh no, parents don’tread.’ I left New Hampton in a state of euphoria. The thought of bringing Joy and Sallyto America filled me with delight, and the future had become a golden glow. Aswe drove through the snowy landscape, everything seemed beautiful. We passed asignpost pointing to Danbury, where my favourite American composer, CharlesIves, had been born, and another pointing to Concord, associated with Thoreau(whose Walden had been a kind of bible of my teens), and I had the feeling thatthey were still alive and I could go and meet them.Two weeks later – on 30 January – I would experience the same feeling inWashington, on my way to Dan Danziger’s house. The snow was deep, and I wasreflecting on the feeling I had experienced driving from New Hampton – the senseof reality of the past. Of course, we know the past was as real as the present,but somehow, we don’t ‘believe’ it. G. K. Chesterton had made the same pointwhen he had said: ‘You say thankyou when someone passes you the salt, but youdon’t mean it. You say the earth is round, but you don’t mean it …’ But thereare sudden moments when the mind seems to wake up, and then you can say thingsand mean them. The psychologist Pierre Janet called it ‘the reality function’,the part of the mind that gives you a sense of being wide awake and in touchwith reality.But then, there are those sudden moments when the whole world seems marvellouslyreal – Proust’s ‘moments bienheureux’, when Marcel ‘ceases to feel mediocre,accidental, mortal’. In that moment, he can say: ‘Yes, I was a child inCombray’, and mean it, just as an astronaut in space can say ‘The earth isround’ and mean it.This struck me as one of the most exciting ideas I had ever had, and in anattempt to give it a name, I decided to call it ‘Faculty X’. It would become thecentre of gravity of books like The Occult, Mysteries and Beyond the Occult. Thebasic aim of human evolution, I decided, is to achieve Faculty X. The weekend after meeting Calder Willingham, I stayed in Brooklyn Heights with aminister called the Reverend Bill Glenesk. He had come to call on me in Englandand had invited me to stay with him when I came to New York.He lived in Remsen Street, and was certainly the most flamboyant clergyman I hadever met. I suspect he became a clergyman because of its histrionicpossibilities, for his greatest interest in life was the theatre and ballet, andhis walls were covered with signed photographs of Nureyev, Margot Fonteyn andother celebrities. He introduced me to a man we bumped into on the street asJudge Samuel S. Liebowitz of the US Supreme Court – I had actually read a bookabout him.Bill preached like a man on stage, and accompanied the hymns by crashing cymbalstogether. In England, there would have been complaints to his bishop, but hiscongregation loved him. He certainly kept things lively for them – I attended aRobert Frost evening in his church, in which the poems were read by two actorsand I joined in the discussion that followed.Bill was also a friend of Norman Mailer, who lived just down the street nearBrooklyn Bridge, and when I said I’d like to meet Mailer, he gave me histelephone number.Mailer had a tough voice with a Brooklyn accent, so that he sounded like anightclub bouncer, but he was amiable enough on the phone, and invited me roundfor lunch.His flat was up several flights of stairs in an old Brooklyn building, and had amagnificent view of the river. On his walls there were a number of framedreviews of his books – not, as one might expect, complimentary, but violentlyhostile. One of his novel The Deer Park announced: ‘THE DEER PARK IS GETTINGNOTHING BUT RAVES’, then had a selection of quotes: ‘sordid – crummy’, ‘moronicmindlessness’, ‘disgusting’, ‘exasperating’, ‘unsavory junk’, and many more, towhich Mailer had added the comment ‘A BUNCH OF BUMS’. Others, of his most recentnovel, An American Dream, were even worse.Mailer had the physical presence of a prize fighter, a notion that would havepleased him, since he obviously placed great store in male self-assertion; hewould not have been out of place in a 1930s gangster movie. You felt that, likeHemingway, he would like to beat up his most persistent critics. Yet far frombeing an assertive egoist – most stories about him involved getting drunk andstarting fights – he struck me as intelligent and sensitive.His latest wife, Beverley, was taller than he was, and had shoulder-lengthblonde hair. She provided an excellent lunch, and meanwhile, Norman offered me avodka. I explained that I was not drinking at present, but accepted a tomatojuice, while Norman poured himself a bloody Mary with what must have been aquadruple vodka. Then we stood and admired an enormous model of a futuristiccity that Norman had built out of Lego blocks and looked like a surrealisticcathedral.We talked about writing – not about its literary aspect but – as most writers dowhen they get together – about advances and royalties. He had received anadvance of $125,000 for An American Dream, and I wondered how any publishercould justify this. He explained that when a publisher offers that much for thehardcover edition, he then has to make sure that he will make it back on thepaperback, which may have to sell half a million. Everything then depends on hisadvertising.The agent who had got Mailer this large advance was Scott Meredith, and Normanrecommended that I should move to him. (My own American agent had been the moreconservative firm of Harold Ober, who had been Scott Fitzgerald’s agent.)Naturally, I was enthusiastic – anything that would increase my Americanearnings was welcome.Oddly enough, we devoted some time to discussing dogs. Back in England, Joy hadbeen left with an irritating problem. One of our two dogs, a collie namedBadger, had been bought for Sally as a birthday present (selected by herself ata church bazaar). But he had developed an unfortunate habit of killing chickens– not even for food, but simply for the fun of killing. The day before I leftfor America, he had killed half a dozen ducks on a local farm, and I had paidfor them.When I told Norman about the problem, he said that he had once owned a dog thatate chickens, and had solved it by tying a chicken round its neck and leaving itthere until it rotted and fell off. ‘It cured it,’ said Norman, ‘the onlyproblem being that if it got into the house it drove everybody else out.’Joy had tried a less radical method. She placed an advertisement in my home-townnewspaper, the Leicester Mercury, that said: ‘Large and amiable dog, excellentwith children, urgently needs a new home, or will have to be destroyed’, andadded our phone number.The day after I had lunched with the Mailers, Joy received dozens of phonecalls. She explained the difficulty to each caller, until one of them said:‘That’s no problem – we live in the middle of a town with no chickens formiles.’ So Joy put Badger on a train from Leicester, with a label on his collar,and we saw the last of him. (The new owner later wrote to say he had settleddown and was excellent with the children.) But Joy continued to receive phonecalls from anxious dog lovers for days.When we talked about lecturing, Mailer made a useful comment that I have sinceoften quoted. He said that in the question period, someone always asks atwo-cent question that requires a ten-dollar answer. Example: ‘What do you thinkare our social responsibilities?’ or ‘What do you think of religion?’ I havementioned Mailer’s observation when someone has posed a question that requires aten-minute answer, and asked them to rephrase it so I end up less out-of-pocket.I decided to risk my own two-cent question. In 1960, Mailer had run for mayor ofNew York as candidate of the Existentialist Party. I asked him what he meant byexistentialism. He waved his hand vaguely; ‘Oh, kinda playing things by ear.’After lunch he asked me if I would like to go to a wedding reception. Thisproved to be a bore – standing with a hundred or so people packed into anairless room, and I made my escape as soon as I could. It was only later that Ilearned from Mailer’s second wife Adele’s book The Last Party that he was anobsessive partygoer, who had once been to eight in one evening.I saw Norman again nearly twenty years later in London, when he was in Englandpublicising a novel called Tough Guys Don’t Dance. I was asked to appear withhim on a television programme – the other guest being Beryl Bainbridge, withwhom Joy had been at school in Liverpool. Norman’s most recent literary exploithad been to praise a condemned killer named Jack Henry Abbott, who had writtento Mailer from prison and, due to Mailer’s efforts, finally been released.Abbott had found freedom and celebrity hard to handle, and had finally stabbed awaiter after some trivial quarrel in front of women Abbott was anxious toimpress. The waiter – a student working his way through college – was killedinstantly, and Abbott, after a few months on the run, returned to jail, thistime for good.As we sat waiting for the cameras to roll, I asked Norman whether he didn’t feelhe had made an appalling mistake in helping to secure Abbott’s release, but hedenied this, saying that Abbott could have gone on to become a fine writer. Hethen suggested that perhaps I ought to get into correspondence with Abbott, asuggestion I turned down.(Abbott would hang himself with a bedsheet in Buffalo jail on 10 February 1992,aged fifty-eight.) Mailer had told me that Auden was in New York. I had never met him, but decidedto give him a ring. Norman warned me that I probably wouldn’t like him. ‘He’svery cold and distant.’ I assumed this might be because Auden was typicallyEnglish, lacking American warmth. Auden answered the phone himself, and invitedme for lunch.I had always been rather ambivalent about Auden’s poetry, no doubt because I wasreading him as if he was an inheritor of T. S. Eliot’s mantle, and of course,the two have very little in common. Auden, while probably a great poet, issomehow more lightweight than Eliot. I have occasionally wondered if this wassomething to do with his homosexuality, for Humphrey Carpenter mentions in hisbiography that Auden felt ashamed of his homosexuality, as if it was a slightlydiscreditable indulgence, like schoolboys smoking behind the toilet. And myfriend Alan Hancox, the Cheltenham bookseller, had showed me some manuscriptpoetry of Auden’s that was a very precise description of two males engaged insodomy.But I became an addict of Auden’s verse when I picked up an American edition andcame upon that remarkable poem ‘The Maze’, which begins: > Anthropos apteros for days> Walked whistling round and round the maze,> Relying happily upon> His temperament for getting on …I was so impressed by this that I learned it by heart.Auden lived near Washington Square, in a flat that faced the street. He camedown himself to answer the door. A few years before, when he became OxfordProfessor of Poetry, I had seen a picture of him in the Sunday Times, with theface covered in so many lines and wrinkles that it looked as if Boris Karloff’smake-up man had been practising on it. Now I saw that this effect was not due tospecial lighting. Auden really did look like something from Famous Monsters ofFilm-land.His partner, Chester Kallman, was away, and the place seemed empty anduncomfortable. I accepted the martini he offered, and talked to him while hecooked lunch. I could see what Norman Mailer meant: there was something dry anddistant about Auden. He had a conventional public-school accent, except that hepronounced the a’s short – for example, in grass – in the American manner. I wasinclined to wonder if this lack of warmth was due to shyness, or to the factthat I was not homosexual. But then, Isherwood and Spender were both homosexual,and were warm and friendly with me.I drank a glass of beer with lunch. And at some point, Auden asked me what Ithought of Tolkien. I said I thought The Lord of the Rings was one of the greatnovels of the twentieth century and that I had read it twice. Instantly, Auden’smanner thawed, and we talked about Tolkien – whom he knew – for the rest of themeal. It was clear to me that a man who loved Tolkien must be at heart aromantic.After lunch we crossed Washington Square together, but none of the crowds ofstudents seemed to notice Auden. I reflected that this was because he looked aslittle like a poet as T. S. Eliot did. By then we were talking about Romanticpoetry, and I can remember making the comment that man responds to mountainsbecause they remind him of his own inner mountain landscape. Whatever Audenreplied did not stick in my mind.I also asked him why he had decided to exclude ‘The Maze’ from the Englishedition of his poems. He said he didn’t think it good enough – a judgment thatdemonstrated to me that poets are not necessarily the best judges of their ownwork.I concluded that the coolness of his manner was, in fact, shyness, and this wasconfirmed by an incident that took place seven years later, on the only otheroccasion I met him. Auden was appearing at the Cheltenham Literary Festival togive a lecture about religion, and I was then a member of the board of SouthwestArts, who helped finance the festival. When I went up to the canteen an hourbefore his lecture, Auden was eating alone at a bleak table without atablecloth. I asked if he would mind if I joined him, and we ate together. Iasked him about Tolkien, and he told me that Tolkien was ill, and he intended togo and visit him. I told Auden about the problem I was having with the Tolkientrustees: I had written an essay called Tree by Tolkien (echoing Tolkien’s ownstory Leaf by Niggle) and it had been printed in a booklet. But when I sent acopy to Tolkien, it was promptly impounded by the family lawyer, who told methat the title seemed to imply that Tolkien had written it, and asked me tochange it. This seemed to me absurd – like saying that Fanny by Gaslight soundsas if it is written by someone called Gaslight. Auden promised he would see whathe could do about it when he saw Tolkien.From the point of view of delivery, Auden’s lecture was one of the worst I haveever heard. Perhaps he should have had his two or three martinis with dinner. Atall events, he read it aloud, and read it as if he had never seen the scriptbefore. And at one point, he dropped the pages and they went all over the place.He had to pick them up and sort them out.Yet the lecture itself was extremely interesting. Like T. S. Eliot, Audenbelieved that religion is of basic importance to man, and that the modern lackof intellectual interest in it is a sign of the deterioration of our standards.So what he was actually saying struck me as being of primary importance. Itcertainly chimed closely with what I had argued in Religion and the Rebel.So when the fiasco was over, I slipped backstage, walked to his dressing roomwith him, and told him I thought it was an excellent lecture. He brightened upimmediately. ‘Do you really think so?’ And as I talked about what he had said,he relaxed and became obviously more cheerful. As he left to return to Oxford(where he was living) I felt glad I had gone backstage, for it had been a goodlecture, spoiled only by that odd lack of warmth in delivery.I later wrote to ask him if he could smuggle a letter from me in to Tolkien whenhe went to see him, and he said he would try. But one evening a few weeks later,in early September 1973, I switched on the radio, and heard that Tolkien haddied. A few weeks later, Auden also died, at the age of sixty-six. The day before my lunch with Auden, I had preached in Bill Glenesk’s church, andI described it to Joy: ‘It was a huge success, and they clapped me as I sat down– very unusual for church, especially as I said I think Christianity a waste oftime.’ After my ‘sermon’ we had a two-hour discussion over coffee.At Bill Glenesk’s I was reading the latest American best-seller, Truman Capote’sIn Cold Blood. On the whole, I was disappointed: I had been hoping for a Crimeand Punishment, and this commonplace murder by two commonplace thugs struck meas lacking in any quality of interest. There was only one page where the bookcame alive for me: where we learn that the more intelligent of the two killers,Perry Smith, began to take an interest in philosophy while he was awaitingexecution. It made me think of Dr Johnson’s remark: ‘When a man knows he is tobe hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.’ If Perry Smithhad tried concentrating his mind before he killed the Clutters, he would nothave ended on the gallows.I had asked Mailer what he thought of In Cold Blood, and he had said he thoughtit was a very fine novel. I said I couldn’t agree, and that the prose struck meas undistinguished. Norman picked up a copy of the novel, flipped through it,then read aloud a passage in which the two killers are in a bedroom in a cheapboarding house, and Capote mentions the ‘violet-tinted glass’ of the mirror.That, he thought, showed brilliant observation. I said that I thought it wasjust the kind of thing a queer would notice, and Norman laughed and conceded thepoint. I should add that in retrospect I have come to greatly admire the novel.The following weekend I stayed again in Washington, where I was lecturing at theLibrary of Congress. I was staying with a woman called Marion Leiter, whom I hadmet in New York at dinner with Alan Pryce Jones, the editor of The TimesLiterary Supplement. She was universally known as ‘Oatsey’, but I really felt Icouldn’t address any woman as Oatsey, and stuck to ‘Marion’. An attractive womanin her mid-forties, she told me I could stay at her house when I came toWashington. And since this would save hotel bills, and enable me to send moremoney home, I accepted with gratitude.When I told Dan Danziger I was staying with Marion Leiter, he looked impressedand told me she was a famous Washington hostess who had been a friend ofPresident Kennedy. Her husband had worked for the CIA and been a friend of IanFleming, who had put him into the James Bond novels as Bond’s Americancounterpart, Felix Leiter. It was Leiter who had introduced Kennedy to the Bondnovels, and Kennedy had said something complimentary about them that had helpedturn them into bestsellers in America. (Fleming had repaid the compliment bymaking Bond read Kennedy’s Profiles in Courage.)So when I arrived in Washington I went to Marion’s house in Georgetown. It wasnot huge, but was very beautiful, and full of rare antiques. I felt slightly outof place in this magnificent house, with its black servants – worried in case Iknocked over some Ming vase.I bumped into Stephen Spender at Georgetown University. It had been ten yearssince I had first met him, and it made me realise that I had become far moreself-confident in that time – perhaps Stephen’s own slightly diffident mannermade me more aware of it. When I told Marion that I had seen Stephen, she askedme to invite him around the following evening, when she was giving a dinnerparty.So we all sat around the table in Marion’s lovely dining room. Most of theguests seemed to have political connections. Stephen and I, sitting next to oneanother, talked literature, and I described my meeting with Auden. (Stephenthought Auden still wrote beautifully, but had less and less to say.)I was talking quietly to Stephen about the Kennedy assassination, and thecurrent doubts about whether Oswald was the assassin. I said that my own feelingwas that Oswald was guilty, but that the puzzling thing was that it seemed to begenerally agreed that his marksmanship was appalling. I had said in an accountof the assassination that Oswald was the worst shot in the world, while Kennedywas one of the world’s most accident-prone men. So it was a question of whichwould win out – Oswald’s bad marksmanship or Kennedy’s bad luck. In the event,Kennedy had lost.As I was saying this, there fell one of those silences that happens by chance atparties, so my last sentence was perfectly audible. I felt a little embarrassedas I remembered that Kennedy was regarded as an American icon, but it was toolate to take it back. And once the conversation had turned to Kennedy, I thoughtI might as well clear up a question I was curious about – whether it was truethat Kennedy was a satyr who slept with dozens of women. This time I really feltI had said the wrong thing. People stared at me disapprovingly and assured methat it was totally untrue that Kennedy was promiscuous. Stephen lookedembarrassed that a fellow-Englishman should commit such a solecism (probablyremembering the episode with Sonia Orwell).It was only a few years later that one of Kennedy’s mistresses, Judith CampbellExner, wrote a book revealing that Kennedy had shared her favours with theChicago mobster Sam Giancana. Then, of course, the dam burst, and the fullextent of Kennedy’s obsessive philandering became public knowledge.Marion, at any rate, seemed to bear me no ill-will, telling the black chauffeurwho drove us to my lecture: ‘You see, Robert, Mr Wilson had no more educationthan you did, and here he is lecturing in the Library of Congress.’ Meanwhile, my lectures were making me feel more strongly than ever that perhapsthe solution to my financial problems lay in this rather than in writing books.What worried me was that I was being forced to write too many books simply tosupport my family. Robert Ardrey had said to me: ‘Brother, you write too much!’I was not afraid of becoming a hack, because I had never written a book merelyfor money. But if I could make $20,000 a year lecturing, it might permit me towrite one book every two years instead of two a year.One student of Hiram College in Ohio told the professor in charge of arranginglectures: ‘If they were all as good as Colin Wilson, you’d always have recordattendances.’ And at my next stop, in Oxford, Ohio, the audiences continued togrow bigger and bigger over three days until the last one was packed tocapacity. All this cheered me greatly, since I had just received a newspaperreport of a court case in Boston where The Sex Diary of Gerard Sorme had beendescribed as obscene. The judge had disagreed, saying that it was no worse thanHenry Miller or Lady Chatterley, but then added that he could not imagine howthe author of this drivel had ever been described by London critics as a man ofgenius. This, I could see, was the direct result of writing too much.A visit to Hollins College in Virginia – my future home – increased my hope of aless strenuous life. The campus was beautiful, with green rolling countryside,and mountains in the background. The faculty houses were pleasant and spaciousbungalows. My future boss, Louis Rubin, proved to be charming, and told me thatHollins would pay for the transport of our household goods from England.The present Writer-in-Residence was a poet named William Jay Smith, but beforehim it had been my old acquaintance William Golding, whom I had met in 1956 whenhe was best known as the author of Lord of the Flies. While he was at Hollins hehad written a book called The Spire. And the Americans had suddenly decided thathe was a great writer, so that his books were now to be seen on every airportbookstall.I personally hated his work, finding it as gloomy as Graham Greene, with itsimplication that human beings are hopelessly trapped in original sin. (I thinkthat, at the time of the Vietnam war, college kids found this view of humannature fashionably pessimistic.) But Golding’s novel about children on a desertisland reverting to barbarism proves nothing of the sort. A zoologist named W.R. Carpenter had noted that when monkeys were transported on a ship to a remoteisland, so they could no longer defend ‘territory’, they seemed to lose alltheir values; males allowed other males to attack their wives and females ceasedto defend their children. As soon as they were on the island, and could choosetheir own territory, they reverted to normal. So apparently monkeys also sufferfrom Original Sin.When, decades later, Golding became my neighbour in Cornwall and invited us tolunch, I felt diffident about putting these criticisms to him, somehow inhibitedby the protocol of guest and host.Hollins certainly looked a perfect place to spend a year. The only thing thatbothered me slightly was whether they might discover that Joy and I were notmarried (Betty was still refusing to give me a divorce). Joy finally solved thisby writing to ask the passport office if they would give her a new one in thename of Mrs Wilson (she had already changed her name to Wilson), and after somehesitation, they obliged. (I often felt that Joy – that sweet, middle-class girlso obviously made for a respectable marriage, got rather a kick out of thefeeling that she was living in sin.)After Hollins, the daily grind of colleges and universities continued. But Ibore in mind my resolution to keep up a high level of drive and purpose,preventing the creeping boredom that had exhausted me on my first trip. Besides,there were pleasant diversions, like the few days I spent in San Francisco(lecturing at Pacific College), where I was able to renew my acquaintance withthe poet Kenneth Rexroth, and spent an inordinate amount of my fees in LawrenceFerlinghetti’s City Lights bookshop.I had met Rexroth in the late 1950s, when he was staying in our local village,Mevagissey, with his wife Marthe and three daughters. I described him to Joy aslooking like a mixture of Mark Twain and Hugh M’Diarmid, with his largemoustache. At that time he was working for a San Francisco radio station, and Irecorded an interview with him.Rexroth was then in his mid-fifties, and was a lifelong anarchist and rebel whohad attacked Senator McCarthy on his radio programme. (He told me he had calledhim a crook and a homosexual: when I asked: ‘Weren’t you afraid he’d sue you?’he explained that the negative publicity would make it counter-productive.)After a lifetime of obscurity as a poet and literary essayist, it amused Rexrothto be regarded as the founding father of the Beat Generation. He told me that inLondon a stranger had said to him: ‘Hello Frankenstein, what are you doing inEurope – trying to hide from your monster?’Rexroth had become the guru of a group of San Francisco poets, including AllenGinsberg, Michael McClure, Philip Whalen and Gary Snyder, and it was at areading of these poets, organised by Rexroth in 1955, that the ‘Beat Generation’was born. In fact, it would be no exaggeration to say that Rexroth wasresponsible for turning San Francisco into a literary centre.The beginning of the public success of the Beat Generation can be dated to 21March 1957, when the San Francisco police bought a copy of Ginsberg’s Howl inthe City Lights bookshop and issued a warrant for the arrest of LawrenceFerlinghetti for publishing it. The case made Ginsberg famous. A few monthslater, Kerouac’s On the Road received a rave review in the New York Times, andeveryone was talking about Rexroth’s ‘monster’.He invited me to dinner at his flat – it was cooked by his teenage daughter Marywho, a year or two later, would become a star in pornographic movies. He andMarthe, he explained, had separated. Their relationship had deteriorated inEurope, and when they returned, she had gone to consult a marriage counsellor.‘What happened?’ I asked. ‘She went to bed with the marriage counsellor.’ Ishrieked with laughter.Oddly enough, Laura del Rivo had spent some time staying with Rexroth in SanFrancisco. She had gone there after selling the film rights of The FurnishedRoom, which had appeared in 1961.By pure chance, I had been able to play a small part in launching the book, forthe Observer had asked me to review a batch of novels – something they did aboutonce a year – and Laura’s happened to be among them. I gave it a warm welcome –while trying not to overstep the bounds of critical objectivity. And in duecourse, a young film director named Michael Winner had bought the rights andturned it into his first major film, West Eleven.Laura had met Rexroth in Cornwall, and gave him a ring in San Francisco. SinceMarthe had just left him, Laura ended by spending four months there and helpingwith the housework and cooking. Rexroth said that everyone who met her hadbecome fond of her, and – although they had not been lovers – obviously felt thesame himself.Rexroth was an amazing raconteur, although one had the feeling that he permittedhimself a certain embellishment. It is typical that he called his autobiography,which he gave me that evening, An Autobiographical Novel, as if to permithimself free rein.Here is a typical Rexroth story, taken from a letter to Joy: > … he told me that he was at a party when a pretty but naïve girl approached> him and said: ‘Who is that fascinating man who looks like the Mad Hatter?’> Rexroth said: ‘There is only one man in the world who looks like the Mad> Hatter – Bertie Russell. I didn’t know he was here.’ She said: ‘Oh, won’t you> introduce me – I admire him so much.’ Rexroth replied: ‘I’ll introduce you if> you like, but first I ought to utter a word of warning. Russell is incapable> of talking to a girl without trying to get his hand inside her panties. And he> doesn’t just fondle – he sticks two fingers up her cunt and two up her ass. If> you want to be treated like a bowling ball, I’ll introduce you.’ The girl> apparently said: ‘I ought to slap your face,’ but was still keen on being> introduced. So Rexroth took her over and introduced her to Russell, who took> her in a corner and proceeded to talk to her very intimately, leaning across> her. Suddenly Rexroth saw her turn bright pink. After a few minutes she got up> hastily, smoothing down her dress, and rushed over to Rexroth saying: ‘You> were quite right.’ The same letter contains another Rexroth anecdote – this one vouched for by hisdaughter: > Rexroth said he was on a train from Oxford to London when into his carriage> got the dirtiest girl he had ever seen. She had on a kind of black dress of> some shiny material, but absolutely covered with food stains and (lower down)> sperm stains; her breasts bounced in a way that indicated she had no bra on,> and he came to suspect she also had no pants. She had a dead-white face and> jet-black hair. She lay down at full length on the opposite seat, her knees> well apart, and proceeded to read the Phaedo in Greek. At some intervening> station, a very respectable man got in, then a well-dressed woman who looked> like the wife of a rich businessman on an afternoon shopping trip to Harrods.> The man glanced at the girl, winced, and hurried on, but the woman was> affronted by the parted knees and general dirt, and said patronisingly: ‘Are> you feeling well, young woman?’ The girl glanced up casually, surveyed her> coldly, and said: ‘Bugger off, bitch.’ The woman gave a shriek of horror and> strode off indignantly.> Rexroth said he was talking with his daughter about whether they would stay at> the Russell Hotel when the girl glanced over at him and said casually: ‘You> can stay in my pad if you like, Rexroth.’ Rexroth refused politely because he> had other arrangements, and he said the girl simply went back to her reading,> quite uninterested, and didn’t try to open a conversation.> Two days later, a Member of Parliament said: ‘I want you to meet the most> intelligent girl in London.’ It turned out to be the same one (called Diane> something), but now looking quite well-dressed and self-possessed. She must> lead a kind of double life … But Rexroth was not enthusiastic about the ‘beat’ way of life, and was scathingabout Kerouac. This was because he felt the beats were too self-centred to careabout other people. He told me a story (which I later verified elsewhere) of howKerouac and a group of friends, including his ‘blood brother’ Neal Cassady, hadbeen smoking pot and talking ideas throughout the night when a girl stood up andsaid: ‘I’ve had enough. I’m going to kill myself.’ The others ignored her as shewent out. She climbed up to the roof but, being stoned, tripped and fell throughthe skylight, then staggered back on to the roof, bleeding badly, and threwherself off just as Kerouac and his friends were emerging into the street.Rexroth felt the girl’s death was Kerouac’s fault.Those few days in San Francisco were a welcome change from the grind ofone-night stands on campuses, and I looked forward to taking Joy there. I alsosaw something of Ferlinghetti, a small, bearded man with very blue eyes and aself-effacing manner. He also had a typical story to tell me about Kerouac.While Henry Miller was still living down the coast at Big Sur, Kerouac decidedone day to go and introduce himself. He ordered a taxi to drive the hundred orso miles, but when the cab arrived, he was drinking and talking in a bar nextdoor to the City Lights (where Laurence was telling me the story), and asked thedriver to wait. Two hours later, at about six in the evening, they set out,Kerouac now drunk and even more talkative. But when they arrived at Big Sur,Kerouac had no idea of the way to Miller’s cabin, which was halfway up amountain. So he went into a field, lay down, and fell asleep. The next morninghe made his way to the nearest bar, rang a taxi, and went back to San Francisco.The story reminded me of my own experience of Kerouac, which had taken placeonly two weeks earlier, in Florida. I had been lecturing at the University ofSouth Florida in Tampa, and the professor in charge of me, a man named JackMoore, told me that Kerouac was living with his mother in nearby St Petersburgand would like to meet me. But after my lecture and question period, I wasapproached by an amiable little man named Cliff, who told me that he and Kerouachad set out earlier in the day to come and hear me, but Kerouac had stopped atevery bar en route – Petersburg was thirty miles away – and was finally so drunkthat Cliff decided to drive him home.I said that I would be in St Petersburg the next day, lecturing at a girls’college. Why didn’t they come to that, and we could go and have a mealafterwards?The following evening, Cliff again came up to me after the lecture. The samething had happened. Kerouac had been sober when they set out, but was so drunkan hour before my lecture that Cliff took him home.I asked what sort of a person Kerouac was. Cliff said he was very kind andgentle, and had a theory that it was important to love everyone. So he spent alot of his time in bars, simply talking to strangers, and was mostly drunk.What Ferlinghetti told me about Kerouac confirmed this. Kerouac seemed to havegiven up all attempt to control his life and had become a drifter. The successof On the Road had destroyed him. Three years later, he was dead at the age ofthirty-seven.By that time, his ‘blood brother’ Neal Casssady, who appears in On the Road asthe swinging beatnik Dean Moriarty, had already been gone a year – dead at theage of thirty-two. He had collapsed from a mixture of alcohol and seconals,ingested just before he tried to walk fifteen miles along a Mexican railroadtrack counting the ties for a bet. In On the Road, Kerouac has a scene in whichone of the female characters tells Moriarty just what is wrong with him: ‘Allyou think about is what’s hanging between your legs and how much money or funyou can get out of people … Not only that, but you’re silly about it. It neveroccurs to you that life is serious and there are people trying to make somethingdecent out of it instead of just goofing off all the time.’This also expresses clearly why Rexroth became so disillusioned about his‘monster’. During most of that lecture tour I had stuck to my resolution not to allow mymind to become bored and slack. When I had long waits on airports, I plugged inmy electric typewriter to the nearest power point and began another letter toJoy. But towards the end of the tour – in late March – sheer travel fatiguebegan to catch up with me. And as soon as I allowed my will to slacken,everything went wrong. I missed planes, lost my air tickets, and becameaccident-prone. It was as if I had been keeping problems at bay by sheerwill-power, and as soon as I allowed it to relax, all the misfortunes I had sofar avoided landed on me at once.It was an unspeakable relief to stagger on to the plane back to Heathrow. Andalthough most of my American earnings had gone back to England to pay bills, Iat least had the delightful prospect of a year on a professor’s salary."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16> WRITER-IN-RESIDENCEI arrived back in Cornwall a few hours after Joy, who had driven up to St Albansto see her parents. It seemed they were now quite reconciled to me –particularly since I had become a householder and a father.Although I was tired of travel, I decided that Joy needed a holiday, and since Ihad been invited to lecture at her alma mater, Trinity College, Dublin, Idecided to take her on a trip to Ireland. We had not been there since the timeof the ‘horsewhipping scandal’; and when she tried entering Trinity with Damonin a pushchair, she was startled to learn that she was not allowed in withchildren – in all her years there, she had not even noticed that no childrenwere allowed.When I was halfway through my Trinity lecture, the lights failed. But afterthree months of lecturing in America, I knew precisely what I meant to say, andsimply went on talking in the dark. When, a quarter of an hour later, the lightswent on again, the students cheered.The experience made me think again about a spy novel I had been intending towrite since 1963, when I had read a book about sensory deprivation called Insidethe Black Room by Jack Vincent. It seemed that a ‘black room’ – a completelydark and silent chamber into which no sound could penetrate – was ideal forrelaxing overworked students before they sat exams. In the black room, theywould often sleep for fifteen hours, and awake totally refreshed. In that state,they could recall everything they had learned in the past weeks. And if at thatpoint they pressed the button to ask to be released, they could guaranteeexcellent exam results.But if they remained in the black room, they became bored, then increasinglydesperate. Finally, they might begin to experience hallucinations, or slip intodepression and mental breakdown.There was a rumour that the Chinese had used black rooms to brainwash Americanprisoners during the Korean war, and convert them to Communist ideology. And Iintended to use this idea as the basis for my novel. Suppose some undercoverorganisation was kidnapping spies from both sides, then brainwashing them in ablack room, and using them as double agents …The question I had set myself was this: how could you train a spy to build upresistance to sensory deprivation? It is not difficult to train someone to copewith increasingly difficult challenges – commandos do it every day. But how doyou train someone to do the opposite – to cope with complete lack of challenge?Anyone who could devise such a method would, in effect, have discovered thesecret of turning men into gods. A spy who could resist the effects of the blackroom would be a kind of superman.Yet if three months of lecturing in America could enable me to go on lecturingin the dark, surely this argued that such a technique was possible?So in the spring of 1966, I began a first version of the novel that would becomeThe Black Room, and to which I had given the working title Night Without Eyes.And although I worked on it at Hollins, it would be another three years beforeit was published.In late August Joy finally began packing for the trip to Virginia. We weren’tsorry to escape because during July and August our house had been full of guests– one of the penalties of living near the sea. And on a stiflingly hot day inearly September, we left two neighbours in charge of our house, and travelled toLondon on a train called the Riviera, which left at 10.30 and arrived atPaddington in mid-afternoon.We stayed at the huge Great Western Hotel on Paddington station – when built in1854, it had been the largest hotel in England, with over a hundred bedrooms.(Over the years, our children have used its vast corridors as a playground.) Wehad taken two bedrooms, for my wife Betty had arranged to come and see me withour son Roderick (now fifteen), and since Betty flatly refused to meet Joy, whomshe regarded as a scheming tart, we needed the extra room. So I had to leave Joyand my children for the evening to take Betty and Roderick out with Bill Hopkinsand his German girlfriend Carla. Fortunately, it never occurred to Joy to beresentful about being abandoned like this.Twenty-four hours later we were in New York, which was just as hot as London.The driver of the cab that took us to the Saint George’s Hotel in Brooklyn hadto point out that if I opened the window we would lose the advantage of theair-conditioning.The Saint George’s Hotel was a vast barn of a place, rather like the PaddingtonHotel, and its air conditioning was not up to modern standards. But I wanted tostay in Brooklyn to show Joy and Sally that spectacular view of New York fromBrooklyn Bridge – the view that James Cagney admires in City for Conquest. Andindeed, we walked across Brooklyn Bridge, with Damon in his pushchair, thencontinued all the way uptown to the Algonquin, where we had tea.In spite of the heat, I was light-headed with delight at being with my family inNew York. For, as odd as this sounds, this was the first time I reallyappreciated being a successful writer. When The Outsider came out in 1956,everything had been too hectic to be able to enjoy it. Then the tide had turned,and I had years of being attacked. And while life in Cornwall was very pleasant,we had too many money worries – and too many casual visitors – to be able tosigh and relax. But walking across Brooklyn Bridge that afternoon in thesunlight was different. Suddenly I was really there, instead of half-elsewhere,and there was that marvellous sense of setting out on a new adventure.I also felt as if I was redeeming a promise I had made twelve years ago, when Ihad persuaded Joy to break off her engagement and come to London with me. Forher, living with a writer had not been all that different from living with abank manager, since it mostly involved doing the housework and looking afterchildren. And now she was, in effect, on a year’s holiday.On the airport I had found a glossy magazine with a long condensation of GeroldFrank’s book on the Boston Strangler – I was not even aware he had been caught –and I read it from beginning to end, lounging on the bed in the stifling hotelroom, before we found our way downstairs and drank cold Budweiser, savouring thepleasure of being able to take our children into a bar.Two days later we were in Hollins. We were assigned a roomy and pleasantlyfurnished bungalow on a hilltop overlooking the college buildings; our ‘street’was known as Faculty Row. The campus itself has an almost chocolate-boxprettiness, all southern colonial architecture, white colonnades, emerald-greenlawns, immense trees.I was allowed to teach the girls what I liked – in fact, I devoted one class toexplaining the ideas of Karl Marx. No one minded. But since I enjoy teaching, Ispent most of my time explaining my own ideas, or giving them a grounding inphilosophy.One thing had bothered me from the beginning. Although perfectly happy with Joy,and not more susceptible than the next man, I couldn’t help wondering what itwould be like to be surrounded by so many specimens of teenage girlhood. Iexpected to feel like Mr Bloom among a thousand Gertie MacDowells. On my earliervisit, Louis Rubin had mentioned that I could do anything I liked except havethe girls, and I enjoyed telling an apocryphal version of the story in which Ireplied: ‘What, not ONE?’ and Louis replied, after reflection: ‘Well, perhapsjust one.’I need not have worried. A girl is never more attractive than among a crowd ofmen, and never less attractive than when she is among a crowd of females. Girlsin canvas skirts, ankle socks and canvas shoes were no more tempting than acrowd of boys. I even formed a kind of flirtatious relation with my class onthis understanding, rather as you might flirt with the twelve-year-old daughterof a friend.My students used to take a certain pleasure in putting me off my lecture strideby crossing and uncrossing their legs at crucial moments, until they discoveredI tried to stare brazenly up their skirts. They then waited until I took sipsfrom a mug of water before uncrossing their knees: I countered by buying a mugwith a glass bottom. (In fact, it was impossible to see anything but a blur, butthey didn’t realise this.)The mini-skirt had then just come in, and the Hollins version was minier thananything I had ever seen. This made me aware of a paradox. Teenage girls arenaturally sentimental; sex is not a physical act but a corollary of romance.Logically, they should go in for concealment and rosy blushes. But maleattention has to be attracted in the first place, and the mini-skirt is idealfor that purpose. So my students raised their hem lines until they came an inchbelow the crotch, then tried to counteract the effect by looking as demure as ifposing for a picture of the Lady of Shalott.I think most male teachers have this problem: no matter how paternal theirattitude to their students, they find it hard to restrain the normal reflex ofglancing up a skirt as the legs change position – although the Hollins girlsmade it easier by wearing dreadful knee-length panties made of a fabric likearmour plating. One colleague told me a story of a dilemma in which this placedhim. He was overseeing an exam and idly glancing at uncrossed knees when herealised that one girl had a sheaf of papers tucked into the leg of herpanty-girdle, which she could consult by casually pulling back her skirt. Forhalf an hour he struggled with his conscience, but ended by deciding to forgetit.The same colleague, who had a delightful, dry sense of humour, told me how, whenhe applied for the job, he had to fill in a form that included the question: ‘Doyou wish to overthrow the state by force or violence?’ and answered: ‘Force.’It was my increasing accumulation of gramophone records that brought me one ofmy most interesting flashes of insight.In our local supermarket, the inner envelope that contained the record was madeof paper. I greatly preferred polythene, because paper envelopes sucked in dustlike a vacuum cleaner. So I ordered a hundred or so polythene envelopes from arecord shop in Philadelphia.The day they arrived, I chuckled with satisfaction, and seated myself in themiddle of the carpet, with a pile of fifty or so records beside me, and a dampsponge. Then I proceeded to remove each record from its sleeve and paperenvelope, and wipe it clean with the sponge. After that, I inserted it in apolythene envelope, then into the record sleeve, and placed it in a pile on theother side of me.As I was doing this, it occurred to me that anyone watching would regard it asthe most tedious task in the world. And since I myself have always dislikedrepetitive jobs, why was I actually enjoying it?Hesse puts his finger on it when he remarks (in Journey to the East) that ‘along time devoted to small details exalts us and increases our strength’. Butwhy?This struck me as the kind of question that takes us to the heart of the mysteryof human consciousness.Clearly when we are deeply absorbed in anything, the beam of consciousnessbecomes narrow and focused, and therefore more intense. The calm autumn days and the beauty of the red leaves could not blind me to thedarker side of this paradise. Every morning as I drove Sally to school I wouldlisten to the car radio. Roanoke was a small town with a population of a hundredthousand. Every other morning, the announcer would mention that there had been arobbery at some gas station or drug store. One day a woman’s body was found in afield near the college. She was a young Catholic, helping to take a census ofco-religionists. Her killer had cut open her body and stuffed her withparaffin-soaked rags, which he set alight. She was the third victim of similarcrimes in two years. Near a girls’ school where I lectured, two youths hadwalked into an ice cream parlour, taken the two girl assistants into the backroom, and shot them both to death.I found the violence hard to understand until one day I took my walk through thevillage behind the campus, inhabited mainly by blacks who worked in the collegeas maintenance men and cleaning women. It had a school, but every window in itwas broken. The houses were rickety wooden shacks, and one was leaning at anangle of forty-five degrees, and propped up with poles. There was no glass inany window – only cardboard or linoleum. The stench was atrocious, but this mayhave been because some houses had pigs in their back yards. The ditches werefull of broken glass, rusty sheets of galvanised tin, discarded shoes, twistedbits of pram, and dead animals (an enormous pregnant rat among them). Aprofessor’s wife who helped run the school told me there was little furniture inthe overcrowded houses. The odd thing was that some of the houses had TVaerials, and a great yellow Cadillac stood outside one of them.As I came back from my walk, the girls were making the most of the sun,stretched out all over the slope below our house, a hundred or so sunburnedbodies in bright bikinis. The contrast was a symbol of the two Americas, ScottFitzgerald’s and Booker T. Washington’s. Suddenly, the local crime rate becameunderstandable.A curious incident reinforced my increasing conviction about the powers of theunconscious mind. I was due to lecture at a Los Angeles college in the morning,and had agreed to meet Joy at Disneyland later. What I had forgotten until Iarrived there was that the theme park covered dozens of acres, and that I mighteasily spend the rest of the day searching. Yet because I had given anexceptionally good lecture, and was full of euphoria, I felt a curious sense ofinner confidence. I relaxed and asked my feet to take me to my family. I moved afew hundred yards down the road, then turned left towards a stall that soldMexican food, and there were Joy and the children. The incident confirmedsomething I had known for a long time – that we possess a sixth sense thatoperates best when we are feeling relaxed and optimistic. One of the most memorable events of that year at Hollins was a trip to BrandeisUniversity to meet Abraham Maslow, who was the head of the PsychologyDepartment.I went alone, since Joy had to look after the children. It was 1 November 1966,and I was met off the plane at Boston by Abe’s assistant, Mike Arons, anintelligent, humorous man – we talked psychology and philosophy all the way toWaltham.I had seen photographs of Abe, with his small grey moustache and hair combedstraight back, so it looked almost like a crew cut. Somehow a crew cut wouldhave suited him, since he seemed so young. (He was fifty-eight at the time.)Photographs gave no impression of his main characteristic – his immense warmthand kindness. He was one of the few people I have met who struck me as genuinelygood.His story was an interesting one. He was born in a cold-water flat in a Brooklynslum, the son of a Jewish immigrant from Kiev. His father was a cooper, whosebusiness slowly improved until he could finally – when Abe was nine – afford acomfortable middle-class home. Abe told me later: ‘My mother is the type that’scalled schizophrenogenic – she’s the one who makes crazy people.’ Because shewas such a self-hating depressive, Abe’s upbringing was taken over by herbrother, an immensely kind man. Abe was skinny, shy, and looked very Jewish, sohe soon encountered anti-Semitism from Italian and Irish kids. This made himdeeply introverted, and he spent all his time reading. The New York publiclibrary later became his university.He was a brilliant student, but his teachers were inclined to react against hisJewishness, and it was not until the Latin teacher praised him, and the rest ofthe class joined in and showed their admiration, that ‘the happy time began’.He was less happy at NYCC – New York City College – where he followed hisfather’s wishes and studied law. He hated it. Throughout his life it was alwaysthe same: if he tried to apply his mind to something that bored him, it wentblank. One day he simply walked out of law class leaving his books behind.He had another problem – he was in love with his cousin Bertha but was far tooshy to express it. Since he was highly sexed, this was hard on him. So he fledto Cornell University, but only stayed a semester. Then, back in New York, hissister gave the romance a shove by pushing Abe into her arms. ‘I kissed her, andnothing terrible happened – the heavens didn’t fall, and Bertha accepted it, andthat was the beginning of a new life.’ The result was a tremendous accession ofself-belief. He studied philosophy, went to concerts, and became a socialist.He married Bertha at Christmas 1928, and both of them decided to study at theUniversity of Wisconsin. It was there he became interested in psychology.First he launched himself into behaviourism, and the study of cats and dogs. Heeven did an experiment which verified that dogs would not eat dog meat.When he graduated, he found a job at Brooklyn College, and remained there forfourteen years. There he worked mostly with underprivileged children, which gavehim deep satisfaction. At one point he felt that this dead-end job was unfair toBertha, and he asked her whether she felt he should aim more determinedly forpromotion or a better job. Bertha said no – he should do what he enjoyed most.And from that moment, Abe said, everything suddenly started to go right.I could empathise, for the same thing had happened to me, when I decided to stoptrying to get published, and simply write books and put them in a cupboard. Thefirst result of that decision was The Outsider.His brilliance as a research psychologist became recognised, and his interest in‘higher reaches of human nature’ began to attract increasing sympathy in thepsychological community, dominated for so many years by a narrow Freudianobsession with sexual neurosis. Maslow had decided at an earlier stage that hefelt closer to Alfred Adler, who recognised the role of feelings of inferiorityin neurosis, and invented the term ‘inferiority complex’. Maslow continued toproclaim his admiration for Freud as the greatest of psychologists, but I feltthat this was out of a desire not to upset the Freudian establishment.In 1951 his brilliance was rewarded by the job at Brandeis, and it was there,fifteen years later, that I spent three days with him. And the warmth andmildness made me understand why his psychology was so non-Freudian. That earlyshyness and hunger for affection meant that his psychology had to have room forlove and optimism and creativity.His preference for Adler over Freud obviously had its root in the feelings ofinferiority that he suffered in childhood and adolescence. And those feelingsalso explained his kindness and gentleness. In that respect he reminded me ofAlfred Reynolds – his brush with anti-Semitism had made him doubly sympatheticto his fellow human beings.His conversion to Adler happened when he was studying apes in the Bronx Zoo. Hesaid he noticed that they screwed all the time. Then he noticed that males oftenmounted other males, and females other females. That seemed to prove Freud’stheory that sex is the most basic drive. Then he noticed something that causedthe veils to fall from his eyes. The monkeys who did the mounting were alwaysthe dominant ones. All this sex was a display of dominance or inferiority. Fromthen on, he knew Adler was right.Given that Abe was so people-oriented, it was natural that he would find me toological and rational, and he says so in his journals, in which he describes myvisit. He complains that I am ‘not at all interested in visual aesthetics, inbeauty of the surroundings, etc., or in emotion experienced, or in affection,etc., even tho he philosophizes about all these. For instance, he derogates thecosmic-consciousness in favour of the laser, narrowing-down type. Indeed, hesees no use at all in peak experience as emotion – only as perception of truth &as helps in solving problems. Very active, pragmatic, & rejects altogether, &even with a certain contempt, the Taoist, the receptive, the passive. Veryphallic and active throughout his thinking, & doesn’t really feel or accept orbuild into his system the feminine.’ But he adds that, since I am onlythirty-five, I would eventually change as I got older ‘and less sexy’. (On thatpoint he was right.)Abe himself had a real sexual problem, and explained to me that it isfrustrating to have to hold back on sex in case it gives you a heart attack.He also complains about the preoccupation with dominance in my thinking and thatof Bob Ardrey, which he describes as ‘a kind of elitism, to hell with the weak’.I think that neither myself nor Ardrey would accept that criticism; both of uswere interested in dominance primarily because it is a key to social problemssuch as war and crime.Abe’s mildness and kindness meant that people grew very fond of him, and I wasno exception. So in 1968, when an American publisher suggested I should write abook about him, I accepted instantly. Abe cooperated by sending me many tapesand unpublished papers. And I was working hard on the book when I received aletter from his secretary saying he had died on 8 June 1972. In the New Year 1967, there was good news. My novel The Glass Cage, based on‘Jack the Stripper’, had appeared in England and been a critical success. Notlong after that. The Mind Parasites, written for August Derleth, came out inEngland. This had been written in the autumn of 1965, before The Glass Cage, butmy publisher thought The Glass Cage had better commercial prospects, and decidedto publish this first. His doubts proved groundless, and The Mind Parasitesreceived such good reviews that it began to look as if the years of hostility –created by the ‘Angry Young Man’ hysteria – might be drawing to an end.Moreover, my Introduction to the New Existentialism, which appeared in Americain the spring, sold unexpectedly well on campuses. I have no idea whether thiswas because my lectures in America were creating a new audience; but after yearsof hostile reviews, it was marvellous to stop feeling harassed by critics.After we had been at Hollins six months, I began to feel that this was the idealway of life for a writer – no money worries, plenty of leisure, and periodiclecture trips to other parts of the country. I started to wonder whether Hollinsmight be willing to take me on as a permanent faculty member. But then I beganto have second thoughts. The trouble with a place like Hollins was that it wastoo comfortable and too small. It was like living in a delightful village, whereeveryone knows everyone else’s business.It struck me that a large university might be the answer. So I wrote to theEnglish Department at the University of Washington, in Seattle, asking them ifthey needed a Writer-in-Residence. (Two years earlier, I had met a professorfrom Seattle at a party in London, and he had suggested the idea.) And when theywrote back to say they would like me there the following year, I was glad I hadnot pursued the idea of staying on at Hollins. All writers have this craving forsecurity, but too much security can induce a kind of hypnotic drowsiness thateasily turns into sterility. (Since then I have come to suspect that this is whymy guardian angel has always kept me so broke.)I had one more extremely important insight at Hollins, which sprang out of therecognition about ‘leakage’.I had bought a copy of Ardrey’s sequel to African Genesis, The TerritorialImperative. In this I found a story that fascinated me. Two zoologists namedRubinstein and Best were studying planarian worms, which are among the simplestcreatures on the earth. Because they are so simple – no brain, no nervoussystem, no sexual organs – they are ideal for breeding experiments over severalgenerations. Rubinstein and Best were investigating their learning capacity.The worms were placed in a plastic tube full of water, which had a Y-shapeddivision. Then the experimenter turned a tap that drained off all the water. Andthe worms, which need water to live, would rush off down the tube looking forwater. Soon they came to the fork. One way was lighted, and led to water; theother way was dark, and didn’t. Most of the worms quickly mastered the trick,and could find their way to the water every time.As Rubinstein and Best kept demonstrating their performing worms to colleagues,a puzzling thing happened: the planaria began to take the wrong turning. Andfinally, some of them would just lie still when the water was drained off, as ifsaying: ‘Oh God, not again …’ They would prefer to die rather than move.That baffled the scientists, and one of them made the bizarre suggestion:‘Perhaps they’re bored.’ ‘Don’t be silly,’ said the other. ‘How can creatureswithout a brain or nervous system get bored?’Nevertheless, they devised an experiment to test the hypothesis. They took twotubes, one made of rough plastic and one made of smooth plastic, so the wormscould feel the difference with their stomachs. In the rough plastic tube, thewater was down the dark alleyway; in the smooth plastic tube, it was down thelighted one.Now taking a new lot of planaria, the scientists would transfer them from onetube to the other, draining off the water and seeing if the worms could findmore – either down the dark tube or the lighted one. This was obviously far morecomplicated, and only one third of the worms mastered this double-ambiguityproblem.But that third never regressed. They could repeat the experiment a thousandtimes, and never start making the wrong choice.In short, the first lot of planaria had been bored. And being forced to puttwice as much effort into the learning experience meant the second lot ceased toget bored.This explained why I had enjoyed cleaning records and putting them in plasticenvelopes: I was putting a certain effort into the process. I developed thisinsight in a long essay called ‘Shake the Mind Awake’, written on Christmas Day1966, and dedicated it to Robert Ardrey and Abraham Maslow. It has sincevanished and, unless a copy exists among their posthumous papers, has ceased toexist. (Abe died of a heart attack in 1972, Bob of lung cancer – he was a chainsmoker – in 1980.) In what seemed an absurdly short time, our year at Hollins was over. By mid-Maythe girls were leaving for the long summer holiday, and it was time for us topack. We had to decide what to send back to England, and what to leave inAmerica.A friend I had made in North Carolina on my first lecture tour – a professor ofphilosophy named Pat Murphy – was now teaching at the C. W. Post University onLong Island, and offered to store our trunks in his basement. We drove up to NewYork with all our household goods packed in a marvellous contraption called aU-Haul trailer, and unloaded them in Pat’s basement, then returned the trailerto a local depot. After a day or two lounging on the beaches and taking Pat andhis wife to the best fish restaurants on Long Island, we made our way toIdlewild, and by early June were back in Cornwall."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17> SEATTLEWe returned to find England in the midst of one of its periodic credit squeezes,and a letter from our bank manager demanding that we reduce our £2,000overdraft.As I look back on the continual cash crises of the 1960s I am amazed that I tookit all so casually. But on reflection I can understand why. I had spent mychildhood in a house where the total income was £3 a week. And I had worked foryears in factories and offices for very little more. So now our lifestyle seemedaffluent, with enough money to travel and buy wine and books. Even to have anagging bank manager was a sign of my new middle-class status.The only time I occasionally succumbed to anxiety was in the middle of thenight, when I woke and began to think about our debts, and what would happen ifI ran out of ideas for books. One of my drinking companions liked to quote aline about a writer ‘whose works predeceased him’. What if I was forgotten bythe time I was fifty? What would happen to Joy and the children? But moods likethis had always vanished by the time I opened my eyes in the morning.In that summer of 1967 there were at least some encouraging prospects. Hollywoodwas interested in buying an option on my novel The Glass Cage.The novel – my fourth since Ritual in the Dark – was a return to the theme ofthe mass murderer. And as Ritual was based on the crimes of Jack the Ripper, TheGlass Cage took as its starting point the crimes of the ‘Thames nude murderer’nicknamed ‘Jack the Stripper’.Between February 1964 and February 1965, eight prostitutes had been found nakedand dead, most of them along the foreshore of the Thames. All had been killed bya rather peculiar method (although this was not revealed at the time): thekiller had induced them to perform oral sex, then forced down their heads on tohis erection, choking them to death.Jack the Stripper was never caught – there is reason to think he committedsuicide as the police cordon closed round him, for they had located the place –on a trading estate – where he kept the bodies before disposing of them.The case had intrigued me because several of the prostitutes came from theNotting Hill area – where Bill Hopkins and Laura del Rivo still lived – and hadused the same pub on a corner in Portobello Road, not more than a hundred yardsfrom Laura’s room. I had occasionally had a drink there myself.As in Ritual, I had broadened my scope by borrowing some details from a secondmurder case: this time the Cleveland Torso murders, which had taken place in themid-1930s. The ‘Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run’ killed a dozen men and women,cutting off their heads. At the time, the Safety Director of Cleveland was EliotNess, the man who had destroyed so many of Al Capone’s bootlegging operations inChicago, and who became the subject of the book The Untouchables. Its author,Oscar Fraley, went on to write an account of Ness’s later period in Cleveland,under the title Four Against the Mob and included an account of the TorsoKiller. According to Ness, this man was a psychotic homosexual (most of thevictims were male vagrants) who was able to escape arrest by having himselfcommitted to a mental hospital. According to Ness, the Butcher (whom he calledGaylord Sundheim) was a big man who came from a wealthy family.I used Sundheim’s name and description for my killer. The man who tracks himdown, Damon Reade, is a Blake scholar whose name I borrowed from my son’sgodfather, Foster Damon.The Glass Cage went on to sell 10,000 copies in England, and a similar number inAmerica. And soon after we returned from Hollins, we heard that a Hollywooddirector, John Schlesinger, wanted to take an option on it for Paramount. Thiswould amount to £10,000, half payable immediately and half in a year’s time.£5,000 represented about half my yearly income at the time.There was also some prospect of turning Ritual in the Dark into a film. InAmerica in 1961 I had met a brilliant young creative writing student named SteveGeller, who was far ahead of the rest of his class. He went on to write aremarkable first novel called She Let Him Continue, which had been optioned byHollywood (and would be made into a film called Pretty Poison, with AnthonyPerkins and Tuesday Weld). Now he had formed his own film company, PequodProductions, and Ritual was to be its first venture. I had written a first draftof the script while at Hollins.No money had, of course, changed hands – this would be paid if – and when –Steve raised the finance.We were hoping for the first £5,000 on The Glass Cage before we left forAmerica, but there were all the usual delays – some underling at my Americanagent’s sending the contracts by surface mail instead of airmail, and a postaldelay that made them take four days to arrive from London by first-class post.But at least I was then able to show them to my bank manager, who thereuponagreed to allow us to increase the overdraft by another £1,000. This enabled usto pay our £300 fares to America. (Damon was now two, old enough to have to payhalf-fare.)We left Cornwall in late August. The weather over New York was so bad that ourplane was unable to land, and was diverted to Hartford, Connecticut. That seemeda marvellous piece of serendipity, for we had lent the car to some people inHartford, and it looked as if this would save us a long journey to collect it.But after a night in a Hartford motel, we were unable to get an answer to ourphone calls. We hired a car, and located the house – only to learn from anext-door neighbour that they were away on holiday. Our car was in an old barn,but we had no ignition key. Eventually, we had to remove the lock from the cardoor to find its number, take it to a locksmith, and get a new key cut. Wefinally arrived at Pat Murphy’s, on Long Island, forty-eight hours late.I went to see my New York agent, and collected a cheque for The Glass Cage –$15,000, minus 10 per cent commission. At the current exchange rate, thisrepresented over £4,000, probably the largest single sum I had ever received.About half of that had to go back to England to reduce my overdraft. But theremaining £2,000 made us feel we could relax and enjoy the drive to Seattle.The trip from the east to the west coast took three weeks, at a rate of abouttwo hundred miles a day, and it enabled me to understand why Kerouac was somystically obsessed by the vast spaces of America. Its sheer size created asense of awe. After those industrial cities of the east – like Buffalo, whichleft our car covered with a fine layer of soot – the country suddenly opened outinto those endless flat plains of the midwest, then into the real west, theBadlands of South Dakota, with red, flat-topped mesas rising out of the desert.Finally, up over the Cascade Mountains, then down the rich green slopes towardsPuget Sound and the Pacific.The next day, after three weeks of travel, we located our bungalow in Seattle,two miles from the university. It was not as attractive as our home in Hollins,and rather sparsely furnished. Damon saw a small boy of about his own ageplaying outside, and immediately went and punched him. He turned out to be theson of the couple with whom we shared the duplex, and we hastened to apologiseand explain that Damon was not normally violent.Joy went off shopping for our dinner, and returned with a strange fish calledred snapper, which proved to be as good as anything we could have found inCornwall.My new boss, Robert Heilman, was as amiable and helpful as Louis Rubin. Heshowed me to my office, at the top of the English Department building, and toldme that I would be teaching four mornings and two afternoons a week – a heavierschedule than Hollins. But I had no reason to complain, for I was writing a bookon Shaw, and could use it as a textbook for my class on Shaw. As to theafternoon classes, I taught existential philosophy and my own ideas. These werea great success, and within a week my class sizes had more than doubled.Within a day or so of arriving, we were invited to a faculty party in my honour– and that of the other writer-in-residence, the Welsh poet Vernon Watkins, whohad been a friend of Dylan Thomas. A few days later, Robert Heilman came to ourhome to announce that Vernon had died of a heart attack. He had been playingtennis when his wife Gwen had dropped by and said; ‘Isn’t it time you stopped?You look hot.’ ‘Just one more game,’ said Vernon – and never finished it.I took this as a warning, and began an intensive diet that reduced my weight bytwo stone.Like Hollins, the University of Washington encouraged me to go to other collegesand universities. I spent an interesting week lecturing in San Francisco,staying in a cheap hotel on Sutter Street, seeing something of Kenneth Rexroth,Lawrence Ferlinghetti and other friends I had made on my previous visit. I wasalone there – Joy would have liked to come, but it seemed pointless to spend thefees I was earning on hotel bills.1967 was, of course, the era of the Flower Children, and ‘love-ins’ in theGolden Gate Park. Rexroth lived around the corner from Haight-Ashbury, and westrolled among the hippies who wore cut-off jeans and shoulder-length hair andanti-Vietnam badges. We may well have passed Charles Manson, who had just beenreleased from prison that year, and was recruiting mistresses and disciplesalong Haight-Ashbury. But it would be two more years before Manson’s familyembarked on murder.In fact, I saw rather less of the San Francisco drug culture than of the poetsand occultists who spent their evenings in a British-style pub called theEdinburgh Castle, where you could buy draft beer and eat fish and chips.I spent much of that week with a friend named Dick Roberts, a longshoreman whoearned remarkably high wages because the trade unions in San Francisco were sopowerful that their members were paid top rates whether they were working ornot. The days of starvation, which had turned Jack London into a social rebel,were long over. Dick had been able to afford to buy his own house, and build upa remarkable collection of the works of Jung, whom he regarded as the greatestman of the twentieth century.In San Francisco I also saw something of a professor and his wife I had met inVirginia. He was working at a university near San Francisco, and was findinglife on the west coast far more entertaining than Virginia. He smoked pot, andattended all-night parties that turned into sexual orgies. I shall disguise hisidentity by calling him Terry.Terry told me a story that was typical of his temperament, which was scepticaland detached. At one of these orgies, he had been lying naked on the floor amonga tangle of male and female bodies. He had been lying on his side, while a girlsucked his erection, and he performed oral sex on another. Suddenly, thesituation struck him as so absurd and grotesque that he went into hystericallaughter – to the astonishment of both sexual partners.His wife Jane, who was a friend of Joy’s, was not of an experimentaldisposition, and when I saw them, the strain was beginning to tell.It was a year later, when she came to visit us in Cornwall, that I heard thesequel to the story.Jane’s brother had found himself a teaching job in Oregon, and Jane agreed to goand become his housekeeper. But when she told Terry she was leaving him, hevowed to turn over a new leaf. He found himself a teaching job in Ohio, andtried to persuade her to join him. She agonised for days: ‘Oregon or Ohio?’ Andthen, like a revelation, it struck her: ‘I don’t have to go to Oregon or Ohio.I’m free.’ She was suddenly flooded with an enormous sense of wellbeing. Fordays, she felt as if she was walking on air. She said that even her tennisimproved.When she came to see us, she was in Ohio with Terry. But she said she couldstill bring back that insight by simply thinking: I’m free.This fascinated me. Obviously, what had happened was basically the same thingthat happened to Maslow’s young mother, watching her husband and children eatingbreakfast. She had literally ‘awakened’ to something, and had learned the trickof waking up whenever she felt inclined.It reminded me of something that had happened when I was lecturing at a girls’college in 1961. One of the teachers was a very good-looking young man, and itwas obvious that the girls adored him. Perhaps out of envy, I assumed he wasrather empty-headed. But as I was talking about the peak experience in hisclass, he said: ‘Yes, I can do that.’ I looked at him in astonishment; ‘You cando it? How?’He explained that when he was a young boy, his mother became very irritable ifhe fidgeted in church. And one day his mother said: ‘If you do that once more,you’re not going to get any dinner.’ As he sat there in church he began to itch,and was tempted to scratch. But he knew that if he did, there would be nodinner. The itch became agonising; he longed to scratch, but didn’t dare. Andthen, as he concentrated on the itch, it suddenly turned into a peak experience.And ever since that time, he said, he could do it at will.He gave a sudden wiggle, and beamed at us. ‘There, I did it then!’Joy and I also spent some time in Vancouver, which was an afternoon’s drive overthe Canadian border, and had two universities, Simon Frazer and the Universityof British Columbia. Both of them invited me to lecture. And it was at the endof a week lecturing at Simon Frazer that I achieved another vital flash ofinsight.Simon Frazer University is on top of a mountain, and I spent most afternoonsthere, driving back to Joy and the children in the early evening. My class,whose composition included teenagers and middle-aged men and women, often keptme talking long after the class was over.My last day there was a Friday, and I was beginning to tire. I had beenexplaining to them how to induce the peak experience using the ‘pen trick’:repeatedly concentrating hard on a pen against a blank wall, then relaxing.Eventually attention becomes fatigued, at which point a final burst ofconcentration will give access to the peak experience.I illustrated my meaning to the class by talking about a friend of mine who usedto climb Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square. His name was Bill Powell, and heachieved it with the aid of a wide leather belt that stretched all the wayaround the column.Bill would brace his feet again the column and walk upwards. When his feet wereon the same level as his shoulders, he would relax his knees momentarily, andhitch up the belt. Then another walk upwards.The problem, Bill said, was that when you were nearly at the top, your kneesbegan to hurt so badly that it was difficult to go on. But of course, relaxationwas impossible because he would have slipped all the way down again. You had togo on.This, I explained, also applied to achieving the peak experience with methodslike the ‘pen trick’. The mind becomes tired, and it is a temptation to relax –a temptation that must be avoided unless you want to throw away the results ofyour effort.By the time I left Simon Frazer on the final afternoon I was exhausted, andsimply wanted to get back to the motel and have a martini. As I drove down themountain in the dusk, lights were reflected all over Vancouver Bay, producing afairytale effect. I thought: isn’t it absurd – it all looks so beautiful, andI’m too bloody tired to enjoy it.This thought seemed to shake me awake, and I felt like swearing aloud. I hadbeen telling my students that when the attention was fatigued, they were closeto the peak experience. And yet here was I, failing to put my advice intopractice …I made a tremendous effort of will that was actually painful, like stretchingtired muscles. And as I did so, the whole bay seemed to explode into light, andI felt a surge of sheer exultation. And, like the effort I had made on the trainon my way to America, it lasted all the way back to the motel as a glow of‘absurd good news’.All I had done, of course, was to achieve what William James calls ‘secondwind’, pushing myself beyond fatigue, beyond my mechanical reactions.There was a difference, I found, between teaching older students – oftenmiddle-aged men and women – and girls like my class at Hollins. The girls werethere because their parents were paying for their education; these olderstudents were there because they felt a hunger to learn. Their lives werealready half-over, and they wanted to start searching for meaning before it wastoo late. Jung had noted how many of his patients were middle-aged men who weresuffering from a sense of meaninglessness. The lecture trip to Vancouver finished just before we embarked for England on aship called the Chusan. We decided that this would be the most restful way ofgoing home.I can still remember my feeling of delight as we steamed out of Seattle harbour,bound for the Panama Canal and the Atlantic – the same feeling of almostecstatic wellbeing I had experienced nine years earlier as we sailed out ofHelsinki and looked at the islands in the sunset. This was the most powerfulexperience so far of what I called ‘holiday consciousness’.In Long Beach, a strange American girl named Kathie came on board to have adrink with us. She was schizophrenic, and had been writing to me since the daysof The Outsider, strange letters written in many coloured inks, often with thesentences scrawled on top of one another. Kathie had first come to visit us atHollins, escorted by a travelling salesman who looked twice her age; it wasobvious that she had once been pretty before mental strain had wrecked herlooks.Kathie was obsessed by me, and responded strongly to my optimism, becomingcheerful and normal after I had been talking to her for half an hour. Sheobviously saw me as the solution to her mental problems, and may have beenright. But then, I would simply have turned into her psychiatrist. All the same,she made me aware that, if all else failed, I could always make a living inpsychiatry.Kathie brought her sister Amy on board with her, and we took them to the bar.But Kathie drank her martinis so fast that she was drunk within half an hour,and I decided to take her down to Joy’s cabin, leaving Joy with Amy.In the cabin, Kathie flopped on the bed face downward, and the Spanish shawl shewas wearing tangled round her shoulders, uncovering an enormous hole in the backof her skirt, which revealed that she was wearing nothing underneath but herknickers. When I told her that her dress seemed to be torn, she mumbledsomething about tearing it in the lavatory. Soon after that, Joy came in –obviously worried in case Kathie seduced me – and I told her that Kathie seemedto have torn her skirt.Half an hour later, Kathie and Amy had to leave. Kathie was now sober enough towalk, and she kissed me passionately as if Joy was not there. As we watched thedock receding, I said I found it hard to understand how she had torn such anenormous hole. Joy said: ‘It wasn’t torn – didn’t you notice that it had beencut with a pair of scissors?’Was it Kathie’s intention to try and seduce me in the cabin? If so, she lost heropportunity when Joy came in.The children enjoyed the voyage. They loved to float in the open-air swimmingpool when the sea was rough, bobbing up and down like corks in their waterwings, while Joy and I dozed in deck chairs. Forty years earlier, alllong-distance travel had been like this, and it struck me as a far morecivilised method than spending nine hours confined to an aeroplane seat.In Kingston, Jamaica, we had absurdly overpriced drinks in a downtown bar. Andon our way back to the Chusan, as our coach passed through some miserableshantytown made of rusty corrugated iron, the blacks came out and shook theirfists at us, shouting, ‘Whitey go home!’, reminding me that here, as at Hollins,the world was divided into the very poor and the comfortably-off – among whom,at least for the time being, we could count ourselves.Joy’s younger brother Neil met us at Southampton, four weeks after we hadboarded the Chusan: he was driving a second-hand Jaguar which Joy hadcommissioned him to buy for us, and we drove back to Cornwall in style. Our house had been transformed in our absence. A local builder named Mr Charles– who was also the taxi-man – had offered to start building an extension whilewe were away. Joy’s kitchen was too small, and Mr Charles extended it to morethan twice its length. He was also in the process of building an extra roomwhere the children could play – or watch television – in the evenings. MrCharles had told us optimistically that all this could be done for £1,000, andwe had been sending him dollars from America. But he had underestimated, and theextensions finally cost us three times that amount.Of course, now we were back home, I could no longer count on making a thousanddollars a month lecturing, and had to rely again on my pen. I was nervous aboutringing the bank manager, afraid that the account would be badly overdrawn. Soit was very pleasant to be told that, on the contrary, we were in credit to thesum of £700 – the first time we had been in credit in ten years. We were evenmore delighted when, a few weeks later, Paramount paid the remaining £5,000 onThe Glass Cage option.I continued to write the book I had started in Seattle, which I referred to as‘the Time novel’, and which later became The Philosopher’s Stone. This wasfinished in July, after which I went back to a final rewrite of my book onBernard Shaw, which took until October.Now I decided it was time for another potboiler to replenish the bank account.Although our bank manager was allowing the overdraft up to £750, and my agenthad agreed to lend me £200 whenever I needed it (and would take it back out ofthe next royalty cheque), we were permanently short of cash. So I began to workon a history of crime, to be called A Casebook of Murder. (This might beregarded as a kind of rehearsal for a later book, A Criminal History ofMankind.) This, I see from my diary, was started the day after I finished theShaw book in mid-October, and finished a week before Christmas. I was turninginto a writing machine.The Outsider was not yet published in paperback in America, and when LawrenceFerlinghetti offered to bring it out as a City Lights book I agreed immediately.But this turned out to be a rash promise, for my American agent wrote to say hehad already sold it to another publisher. By way of an apology to Lawrence, Idecided to write him a short book on mysticism, and give it to him as a present.Originally entitled Poetry and Zen, this was started a week before Christmas andfinished on 3 January 1969.I immediately began a new version of The Black Room but became bogged down aftertwo weeks. It was then I recorded in my diary: ‘Hopeless day on Black Room, butsuddenly got an idea for a third Sorme novel.’ I began work on it the next day.The idea, I seem to recall, came from a leading article in the Daily Telegraph,which deplored the amount of pornography that was being published, and citedmyself and Brigid Brophy as examples of ‘serious’ writers who spiced their bookswith sex to achieve larger sales.Now in my case it was untrue. My most recent books, The Mind Parasites and ThePhilosopher’s Stone, contained no sex at all. But the attack made me thoughtful.After all, Terry Southern’s Candy, written as spoof pornography for OlympiaPress, had become a best-seller in America; so had Portnoy’s Complaint. Thenthere was My Secret Life, the anonymous memoirs of a Victorian gentleman, whichhad been published by Grove Press. I had bought it at Hollins and had beenstruck by his single-minded dedication to the pursuit of sex. It was clear thathe believed the orgasm could one day bring him to the verge of a kind ofmystical insight. I had toyed with the idea of a novel called The Saint of Sex,which I saw as an updated version of The Life of a Great Sinner, the novel thatDostoevsky had planned but never succeeded in writing.Another influence on the book was the stories of Jorge Luis Borges, particularly‘Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius’, an attempt to invent an encyclopedia of a worldwhose language, ideas and modes of thought are completely unlike our own. (I haddedicated The Philosopher’s Stone to Borges. When I sent him a copy, I receiveda charming letter of thanks from his mother, who explained that her son was tooblind and too ill to reply to me, but sent me his warm regards.)So out of this mixture sprang The God of the Labyrinth, whose title is a homageto Borges.In America at that time, a new publisher named Bernard Geis had been making afortune with books that verged on pornography, and it was Geis I had in mindwhen I began The God of the Labyrinth.The plot was simple. Sorme is approached by an American publisher, who intendsto reissue a famous ‘banned’ book of the eighteenth century, Of the Defloweringof Virgins, by an Irish rake named Esmond Donelly. Sorme reads the book andthinks it atrocious and badly written. But since Donelly’s family seat is nearMoycullen, where Sorme lives in Galway, he agrees to research Donelly’s life,and to write an Introduction.In fact, he soon comes upon some unpublished material by Donelly which convinceshim that the ‘banned’ book is a fake, and that Donelly is a far more interestingand intelligent character than he had realised.And now, as he continues his quest for Donelly, he begins to experience curiousflashes of déjà vu, and moments of inexplicable insight into Donelly’s life. Andit gradually dawns upon him that the spirit of the departed Esmond Donelly isguiding his researches.These researches reveal that Esmond was a member of a cult called The Sect ofthe Phoenix, which practised ‘sex magic’ for purposes of seduction, and whichcontinues to exist in the present time.It is as Sorme is driving into Dublin that he begins to experience a curiouseffect of ‘double exposure’. He seems to be surrounded by the Dublin of twocenturies ago. He ‘knows’, for example, that in 1765, the year Esmond set out onthe Grand Tour, this Conygham Road he is driving along was the Chapelizod Road.At Grattan Bridge he is about to turn right when he recalls that this is nolonger the last bridge on the Liffey – that O’Connell Bridge has been builtsince then.What I really needed, at this point in the book, was a map of Dublin in theeighteenth century. I recalled that I had bought Joy a book called DublinFragments, and went in search of it in the attic. I found that it had a map init, and when I opened it, my hair prickled. It was dated 1765, the precise yearI was interested in. It was at that point that I began to wonder whether Esmondwas taking me over too.The weird coincidences continued after The God of the Labyrinth was published. Ihad introduced into the novel a nineteenth-century rake called Edward Sellon,whose pornography is discussed in Spencer Ashbee’s Bibliography of ProhibitedBooks (1877). Reviewing a book on sex magic by Francis King in March 1972, Ilearned that Sellon was, in fact, a student of tantric sex magic. And acorrespondent wrote to me to say that there was a sexual sect innineteenth-century England called The Society of the Peacock. So again, myinvention had been remarkably close to the truth.But my hope that The God of the Labyrinth would become a bestseller came tonothing. My new agent, Scott Meredith – introduced to me by Norman Mailer – sentit to Bernard Geis, who turned it down in April 1969 explaining ‘that it is notso much that it is too intellectual (though it is) but that it is too offbeatand too subtle to respond to our piledriver kind of promotion’. It was publishedby Hart Davis in England in 1970, and probably sold around my usual 10,000copies. Several more American publishers found this tale of literary detectiontoo erudite, and after many rejections, the book appeared, heavily cut, as aSignet paperback under the title The Hedonists.The delay in placing The God of the Labyrinth imposed a strain on our finances.Urgent action was required. The solution was provided by an American friendnamed Millen Brand. Millen was an editor at Crown Publishers, who were about toissue my early autobiography, Voyage to a Beginning. Millen had written aremarkable psychiatric novel called Savage Sleep, based on the work of Dr JohnRosen, a Freudian psychiatrist who developed techniques for curing psychoticpatients – that is, patients who are apparently so ‘mad’ that most mentalhospitals make no attempt to cure them. I had read this while I was finishingThe God of the Labyrinth, and decided to try my hand at a psychiatric novel.What Millen’s book made me realise was that a psychiatric novel would permit meto be unprecedentedly frank about the development of a sex criminal. My ownpredilections suggested that he should be a panty fetishist. So on 2 May 1969, Ibegan writing Lingard as a ‘non-fiction novel’, and continued at an average ofthree thousand words a day. It was finished four weeks later, the finalthirty-six thousand words (144 pages) being written in six days.My British publisher insisted on certain cuts, including two rapes, and inchanging the title to The Killer. But the American edition, under its originaltitle Lingard, was uncensored.I read it again recently, to write an Introduction to a new English edition, andwas surprised to realise that it is probably among my best novels – it certainlyshows no sign of the haste in which it was written.In the year since returning from Seattle I had written six books: ThePhilosopher’s Stone, Bernard Shaw, A Casebook of Murder, Poetry and Zen (laterre-titled Poetry and Mysticism), The God of the Labyrinth and The Killer.It seemed absurd to work as hard as that simply to make a living, and I gave agreat deal of thought to other possibilities – for example, persuading the BBCto follow up Kenneth Clarke’s Civilisation and Bronowski’s Ascent of Man with ahistory of crime and civilisation. For a while this looked promising, butfinally it fell through. Another possibility was to find myself a permanentacademic job in America – there seemed to be plenty of universities who mighthave been interested. The problem here was simply my reluctance to move toanother country. I preferred to stay at home, where I could be among my booksand records, and watch my children growing up in the countryside.But there was at least one interesting future prospect. In the year we returnedfrom America, Scott Meredith had approached me with a proposal for acommissioned book on a subject in which I felt very little interest: the occult.And this would, in fact, change my life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18> THE OCCULTAs a child, I had been fascinated by ghost stories. My grandmother was aspiritualist, so I accepted the idea of life after death from the age of six orso.In the early days of the Second World War, the Sunday People had published aseries by Air Marshall Dowding, in which he discussed the after-deathexperiences of an airman, as relayed through a spirit medium. The next world,the dead airman claimed, was not all that different from this one, except thatthere were no discomforts; grass, trees and sky all looked much as on earth, butwhen he tried swimming, the water was not wet, so it felt rather like swimmingin cotton wool. I read the series avidly every week.Our local library in Leicester, St Barnabas, had an excellent section onpsychical research, and I read all I could find by Harry Price – The MostHaunted House in England, Confessions of a Ghost Hunter, and Poltergeist overEngland.But at the age of ten I was seized by a new passion: science. It was – as I saidearlier – like a religious conversion, a release from the narrow, stifling worldof a working-class childhood into the vast realm of stars and planets and atomicphysics. Years later, in the Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, I found apassage from a letter to Constance Malleson that expressed it precisely: > I must, I must, before I die, find some way to say the essential thing that is> in me, that I have never said yet – a thing that is not love or hate or pity> or scorn, but the very breath of life, fierce and coming from far off,> bringing into human life the vastness and the fearful passionless force of> non-human things. Which explains why the world of the supernatural struck me suddenly asirrelevant and rather silly, and life after death an expression of wishfulthinking.It was when my interest in science started to evaporate at the age of sixteenthat I began to dream of becoming a writer. I continued to feel a revulsiontowards the world of spiritualism and the supernatural. The problem of why weare alive certainly tormented me, but the notion that the answer might lie insome dubious realm of spirits seemed illogical.When travelling around America in the 60s, I had often bought paperbacks aboutghosts and reincarnation at airport bookstalls, for much the same reason that Ibought books on Atlantis or flying saucers: to keep me amused on a long journey.Therefore when Scott Meredith suggested I should write a book on ‘the occult’for Random House, I felt that it would have to be written with my tongue in mycheek. The ‘occult boom’ of the 60s had started with the publication in 1960 ofThe Morning of the Magicians, by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, and it hadbecome a worldwide best-seller. I bought a copy, and found it an outrageoushotch-potch of flying saucers, Atlantis, alchemy, Aleister Crowley, H. P.Lovecraft, and speculations about whether Hitler was a member of a secret occultbrotherhood. It was all so nonsensical that I was unable to finish it.However, I needed the money, and it didn’t matter that much to me if the bookturned out to be a compendium of how many unbelievable things you could believebefore breakfast. Random House was offering a $4,000 advance (about £1,500),half on signature. And my British agent soon found me a London publisher,Hutchinson, who was willing to commission it.Now it so happened that in the summer of 1968, we had been visited by a novelistnamed Robert DeMaria. He was a friend of Pat Murphy, and we had met him on LongIsland, where both taught at the C. W. Post University. Bob told us that theuniversity was setting up an extra-mural department called Dowling College, toteach creative writing, which would be situated on the island of Majorca, andinvited me to spend three months there as Writer-in-Residence. The prospect of along holiday in the Mediterranean sounded marvellous after writing six books ina year, and I lost no time in accepting.I had another motive. The college would be in a village called Deya, whereRobert Graves lived. I had been impressed by Graves’s book The White Goddess, inwhich he argued that the ancient ‘magical’ cult of the moon had been displacedby the solar, intellectual cult that went on to create modern science, and Iwanted to ask Graves’s advice about the occult book.So in September 1968 we set out with our children for Majorca. My part-timesecretary Bunny decided to come with her own three daughters; she wasexperiencing marital problems, and hoped that three months away from home wouldsort them out.In Deya, we were assigned a house halfway up a hill called the Vina Vieja, whichran out of the main square. It had a stone-flagged courtyard and a garden at theback, and the drinking water came from a well in the hallway, which collectedrainwater from the roof.The first night we were awakened by a tremendous racket from above our heads, asif a crowd of urchins was playing football with a melon. But a sound ofpattering feet indicated that it was rats. The noise kept us awake half thenight, until they got tired of whatever they were playing. The next day welearned that they were fruit rats, and regarded as quite harmless. But it wasseveral nights before we grew accustomed to the noise and could sleep throughit.The prevalence of rats was explained by the fact that Deya was divided by a deepstream known as the torrente, which dried up completely during the summer. Thenthe locals simply dumped their household waste into its bed, providing aperpetual feast for the rats. When the winter rains came, they carried therefuse out to sea. But that was still some months away.At the bottom of our hill, a few hundred yards from our front door, there was anexcellent bodega with a restaurant upstairs; carafes of red and white wine costas little as lemonade in England, and the food was also cheap but superb – Ideveloped a passion for squid. A meal for the seven of us cost as little as ameal for two in Cornwall. I began to see why Robert Graves had moved to Deya.At this stage I had not met Graves. He was a friend of Bob DeMaria, whose novelClodia is written in the tradition of I, Claudius. Bob offered to introduce me,but I decided to leave it until my Shaw book arrived, when I could presentGraves with a copy. Meanwhile, I spent my days working in the bedroom – whichwas lighter than downstairs – revising The Killer, and expanding Poetry andMysticism into a book-length study by adding chapters on Yeats, Rupert Brookeand Kazantzakis, as well as on a local Cornish poet and historian A. L. Rowse,whom I had got to know well in recent years.I met Graves finally at a party at the home of his son William, Can Gelat (whichwas also the headquarters of Dowling College). We exchanged only a few words,but I told him I would take a copy of my Shaw book to his house, which wasoutside the village. He was a tall man with an untidy mop of grey hair and abroken nose. The voice was that of an Oxford-educated Englishman, and there wassomething soldierly about the way he carried himself.The following day I walked over to Graves’s house, Cannelun, and met his wifeBeryl, a charming, attractive woman who told me Graves was at the beach.However, I signed a copy of the book and left it with her.To be honest, I was not now sure how much I really wanted to meet Graves. I had,of course, read the Claudius books, and the novel King Jesus. But I knew Gravesregarded himself primarily as a poet, and I had never succeeded in enjoying hispoetry; it seemed to me to lack music. And in his Oxford lectures on poetry hehad attacked Yeats, who was perhaps my favourite poet of the twentieth century.So I was inclined to wonder whether Graves and I really had anything in common.The next morning I received a note from Beryl Graves, asking me to go over for adrink later in the day, and perhaps for a swim with her husband. Accordingly, Iwalked over there at about three that afternoon. Graves was alone, and he showedme around the garden. When I asked him a question about T. E. Lawrence – whom hehad known well – he was distinctly unforthcoming, as if implying: do you expectme to talk about an old friend to a total stranger?Conversations between two writers who are meeting for the first time are alwayscautious, like two boxers sizing one another up. So as we walked down to thebeach – about a mile from the village – I left him to do most of the talking. Hewas explaining that most old Mediterranean villages are built inland because offear of pirates, and that Deya had been raided many times.On the beach we changed into swimming trunks, and Graves asked me if I wouldlike to try the ‘traverse’. He was pointing at the cliff face over the sea, andI could see no path. But I indicated I was willing to try anything.He led me over some sharp rocks, then showed me a handhold and foothold on theface of the cliff. He climbed up himself, then told me to follow. It wasimportant, he said, to put my hands and feet exactly where he put his, otherwiseI would find the next step unnegotiable, and might fall on to the rocks below.These were not more than twelve feet away, but since they were jagged would havecaused some damage.As we moved cautiously over the cliff face, it quickly dawned on me that thiswas a kind of test. But he was also kind about it, explaining very preciselyjust how to place my feet, and how to reach out for the next handhold. And whenfinally we stood on top of a rock overlooking the sea, he dived in gracefully,and I followed suit rather less gracefully – I have never been a good diver. Butas we clambered up the beach he slapped me on the shoulder. ‘You’ll do.’ I knewI had passed the test.From then on, his constraint disappeared, and he treated me as someone he knewand liked.Back at Cannelun he poured me a glass of wine. There was a photograph of him onthe shelf, with his hair looking as if it had been in a tornado. It was by adistinguished photographer, and he asked me what I thought of it. I said: ‘Itmakes you look like the Great Grey Poet.’ He laughed and pretended to punch mein the stomach with his clenched fist. It was clear that I had been accepted.In a book of his love poems that he gave me, he wrote: ‘Colin Wilson from RobertGraves. Glad to meet you at last and find you wholly misrepresented’.The following afternoon Joy and I walked down to the beach, and this time I did‘the traverse’ on my own. Provided you followed Robert’s instructions, it wasless dangerous than it looked. I ended by diving – or perhaps just jumping –into the sea. Later, Robert came to the beach – wearing a vast cowboy hat – justas we were leaving. He asked: ‘Did you do the traverse?’ and when I said yes, helooked pleased.A couple of days later I came back from a class and found Robert in our kitchen.He was teaching Damon how to split a banana into three lengthwise segments withhis thumbnail. He later gave Damon a signed copy of his book The Poor Boy WhoFollowed His Star. And when, years later, Damon became an addict of the I,Claudius series on television, he was impressed to learn that it was written bythe tall man who had taught him to split a banana.On another of our walks, Robert made a comment that stuck in my mind: that truepoetry is written ‘in the fifth dimension’. It was a long time before I figuredout that the fifth dimension is freedom.Graves also made an interesting comment when he was talking about the occult –that many young men use a form of sorcery to seduce women. In fact, I amconvinced that practised seducers use something akin to telepathic hypnosis. Iunderstood what he meant; I had noticed that if I felt strongly attracted by agirl, as I was by Joy, and subsequently by girls I met in the Coffee House, Imerely had to fix my mind intently on seduction, and it would sooner or lateroccur as if I had set in motion some chain of ‘magical’ force.Robert himself had always been, like all romantics, fascinated by women, andinclined to treat them as muses or embodiments of the eternal feminine. He was atypical Leo, with all the drive and dramatic flair. Bob DeMaria told me that hissusceptibility – recorded in his poetry – occasionally caused Beryl some momentsof anxiety. There was in the village a beautiful dark-haired teenager, thedaughter of a wealthy American (Deya was full of rich Americans) who wasRobert’s current ‘muse’. She also came to some of my classes and lectures, andseemed to me a sweet, good-natured girl who was slightly bewildered by theadmiration of this elderly poet, and had no desire to be anyone’s muse. (Robertwas eighty-four, and told Bob DeMaria that when he fell asleep at night, he wasnever sure whether he would wake up in the morning. In fact he lived to beninety.)When we had dinner with Robert and Beryl, he told us that he was convinced thatthe Teix (pronounced Teesh), the mountain range that ran around Deya, had somemagnetic property that influenced people who came to live there, and unsettledthose who were not used to it. (One student from the Institute had a psychoticepisode and threw stones through the Graves’s windows.) This was many yearsbefore I heard of ley lines and earth forces.It was during that first afternoon walk that I told him I had been commissionedto write a book on ‘the occult’, and asked his advice. He gave it in one word:‘Don’t.’But in fact, Graves’s own views on the occult would play a crucial part in theargument of my book: specifically the distinction he makes, in The WhiteGoddess, between ‘solar knowledge’ and ‘lunar knowledge’. Solar knowledge is thekind of rational, daylight knowledge that is the basis of science; lunarknowledge is the kind of intuitive, instinctive knowledge that is the basis ofpoetry and mysticism.The cult of the Lunar Mother-goddess, Graves says, was the original religion ofmankind, but it was gradually eroded by the ‘busy, rational cult of the SolarGod Apollo’, which has cut off modern man from his deep instinctive roots.It seemed to me obvious that if man is to evolve, he needs to be able tore-access that ‘lunar’ part of his being. When that happens, he will create anew kind of science, based on intuition as much as logic. This vision could beexpressed in the phrase: ‘magic is the science of the future’.While I was in Deya, I also learned to appreciate Graves’s poetry, realisingthat it is the poetry of a highly disciplined man who did not (like so manypoets) wear his heart on his sleeve. Although it is Graves I remember most when I think of Deya, there were otherwriters there. One of these, an American professor called George Cockcroft, toldme the plot of a novel he was writing as we walked to the post office in theupper town. It was about a man who feels so incapable of making decisions thathe throws a dice to make up his mind. A few years later, when a publisher sentme the proof of a novel called The Dice Man by Luke Rhinehart, I realised thatGeorge had finally succeeded in publishing it. The novel became a bestseller andwas filmed.I liked George, but he seemed to me in every way the typical college professor –liberal, vaguely intellectual and basically unsure of himself. And as I lecturedto his classes, or drank wine with him in the bodega in the square, it becameclear that he found my ideas – and perhaps my personality – somehow worrying. Hesaw my preoccupation with human evolution and the development of consciousnessas in some way dangerous and threatening, not at all the kind of thing a decentAmerican liberal should be thinking about.One evening, George invited Bunny, Joy and myself to his house for a picnicmeal. About twenty of us sat on the floor in a large room and drank wine and ateoff paper plates. And when we had finished eating, George called for silence,then said: ‘I have asked you all here this evening because I want to talk aboutthe ideas of Colin Wilson, and explain just why I think they are dangerous andunhealthy.’I was outraged. And as he talked on about the ‘fascistic’ undertone of my ideas,evoking shades of Nazism, and representing my dislike of emotionalism as adenial of ordinary humanity, I was inclined to interrupt him, or get up and walkout. But I felt instinctively that this would be to hand him the advantage. So Isuppressed my irritation, and listened quietly. And, as I expected, his ownability to formulate his ideas soon degenerated into vague generalities. Andwhen he stopped, I began to answer reasonably and precisely, pointing out thefalse assumptions that underlay much of what he had said, and his failure tomake a logical case. As I continued to argue, it became clear that I hadcompletely undermined his own case and left him with no more to say.The episode sticks in my mind as one that taught me the importance ofself-discipline in argument, and of not giving way to the impatience to which Iam prone.There were other writers at Dowling College, including the poet Diane Wakovsky,and the novelist Anthony Burgess. I had never met Burgess, or read any of hisnovels, but our talks over a carafe of wine in the bodega revealed him to be inmany ways a man after my own heart – sensitive, widely read and very intelligent– and a good musician and composer. (He had even turned Joyce’s Ulysses into anopera.)On the afternoon of his first lecture, I wandered along to hear it, curious todiscover his views about literature and language. I knew he was an admirer ofJoyce – as I was myself – and looked forward to what he was going to say.In fact, he soon had me thoroughly confused. He began talking about the basicunits of language – not syllables, but phonemes and allophones, the units ofsound, and of the importance to fledgling writers of knowing the differencebetween an autosemanteme and a synsemanteme (whatever they were).To me this was preposterously untrue. I watched the class sink into boredom, andwhen Anthony paused to see if we were following him, I asked politely what allthis had to do with the making of literature. My own feeling was that his bookon Joyce had been too obsessed with the importance of language, as if languagewas a magic tapestry that was important quite apart from the meanings itconveyed. But surely literature was more than merely playing games withlanguage?He replied that as far as he was concerned, literature and language wereinseparable.To me that was absurd. Surely words were merely attempts to pin down meanings?For example, the word orange expressed a specific colour and a specific taste –a taste that was quite unlike lemons or limes. If our eyes became capable ofseeing a new colour, we would need to invent a new word. But the word would haveno importance in itself; it would be, so to speak, the address of a certainmeaning. If science discovers a new particle, then we have to invent a new wordfor it – say muon or quark. But what matters is not the word itself, but itsmeaning, and that is important only because it leads us on to other meanings …My mention of science was like a red rag to a bull. For Anthony, science was theAntichrist, for which he had nothing but contempt. And by the time we had donearguing, it was time for the class to finish. So we strolled down to the bodega– since it was half past five – and continued the argument over a carafe ofwine.I liked Anthony, but found him in some ways irritating and self-important. Heseemed determined to play the part of the multi-talented genius – scholar,composer, linguist – and to impress us with how much he knew. I later cameacross a hostile review of one of his books that referred to him as ‘a pompousknow-all’, and that struck me, on the whole, as a fair description.Whenever I came across this kind of attempt to impress – like Braine’s ‘let metell you’ – I suspected an underlying lack of self-belief. This seemed to beconfirmed as I learned that Anthony was one of those people who are alwaysrunning into problems and complications; somehow, fate seemed determined to makethings go wrong for him. The electricity in his house broke down, then his watersupply. He and his wife Liana succeeded in falling into the torrente whenreturning home from a bibulous party.When he told me that he suffered from a kind of ‘free-floating guilt’, I sawthis as the real cause of his problems. Free-floating guilt is another name forlow inner pressure, the kind of painful lack of self-assurance found in theheroes of Aldous Huxley’s books. And because Burgess was prickly and defensive,the world took pleasure in sticking out its foot and tripping him up.I think it worried him slightly that I obviously liked him – I like most people– because there was an element in him that disliked me. And I would identifythis as the same thing that worried George Cockcroft, and that caused RonnieLaing and David Gascoyne to gang up on me at the Plymouth lecture: the feelingthat anyone who can be cheerful and optimistic must be shallow. There is a kindof Graham Greene-ish gloom in Burgess’s view of the universe (like Greene he wasa Catholic), and I am inclined to feel that it sprang, like Greene’s pessimism,out of weakness.Joyce himself had this prickly defensiveness, this determination to be taken athis own high valuation. In Time and Western Man, Wyndham Lewis puts his fingeron it with wicked accuracy. Stephen Dedalus has to be shown to be effortlesslysuperior to Mulligan, the Rabelaisian Irishman, and Haines, the inhibitedEnglishman, so he always talks ‘quietly’ and does things ‘wearily’. In thelibrary scene, in which he expounds his theory about Shakespeare and Hamlet, hespeaks with an abstruse complexity and parade of learning that would beimpossible in a spontaneous conversation (unless he had learned it by heart).Ulysses is a book by a man determined to get his own back on a great many peoplefor not showing him enough respect. And Burgess was, in his own way, asthin-skinned as Joyce.One evening in Deya, he and I were chosen to lead teams in a quiz. I devisedmost of my team’s questions, some of them musical, i.e. who wrote Mozart’s 37thsymphony? Answer: Haydn (Michael, not Josef). Who wrote Haydn’s Toy Symphony?Answer: Mozart (Leopold, not Wolfgang). Anthony let down his team on bothquestions. His own musical contribution was to sit at the piano and ask us toidentify musical themes, but since I often played this game at home withmusic-loving guests, I knew most of them.In the end, my team won, largely with the help of a student with an encyclopedicknowledge of films (so he could answer: ‘What car did Steve McQueen drive inBullitt?’) and another who knew all about pop music. Yet although it was merelyan evening’s entertainment, I had a feeling that Anthony took his team’s defeatvery badly. For him, life was a game of one-upmanship, and he had lost this one.Finally, Anthony and Liana left Deya, tired of disasters. I never saw him again.But a few years later, I was sent the first volume of his autobiography, LittleWilson and Big God (his real name was John Wilson), and I was impressed by hisaccount of his working-class childhood, and gave the book a warm review.Anthony, in turn, gave my book The Misfits a good review in the Observer in1988, although, as usual, he could not resist pointing out that I had omitted tomention Mario Praz and Ian Gibson’s definitve book, etc., etc. I was glad to seethat I was wrong in supposing he was unfriendly.In this I was mistaken, as I discovered when the second volume of hisautobiography, You’ve Had Your Time, appeared in 1990. The passage describingour period in Deya is waspish – and inaccurate. I am described as ‘a kind ofguru’, and alleged to have thrown off asides such as ‘a major author likemyself’, which would actually have made me cringe with embarrassment. LikeGeorge Cockcroft, Anthony seems to feel that ‘[Wilson’s] presence among theimpressionable American young was perhaps dangerous because they were only tooready to throw over the rational’. And he claims that after attending hislecture on Shakespeare ‘Colin Wilson … had something to say about the pity ofhistory’s unkindness to Shakespeare in not allowing him to be born late enoughto benefit from reading the works of [Colin Wilson]’, which is ponderous satire.When we returned to England in late November, I decided to read some Burgessnovels. I found I was irritated by a kind of pretentiousness, a point that wasunderlined when a friend who found Earthly Powers impressive told me – by way ofpraising it – that he often had to break off reading and look up a word in adictionary.Kingsley Amis seems to have experienced similar reactions in trying to readBurgess. He tells in his autobiography how Anthony gave some of Kingsley’s ownnovels favourable reviews, but was obviously irrritated when Amis failed toreciprocate. Amis says that he tried hard, but simply found them oddlyunreadable. Although anxious to get on with The Occult, I first of all had to rewrite TheBlack Room yet again. After three months of struggle, I find an entry in mydiary: ‘Have basically solved Black Room problem, with passage on planaria.’What I meant by this was that the ‘double ambiguity planaria’, those who wereforced to put twice as much energy into the learning process, never regressed;as soon as the water was drained out of the tube, they would rush off searchingfor more water, and never became bored. Boredom was obviously a function of akind of ‘spoiltness’. And since it is a kind of boredom that causes moralcollapse in the black room, the answer must lie in a kind of training thatdemands increasingly urgent effort.After that insight, the novel proceeded swiftly to the final chapters.Two days after finishing it, on 17 April 1970, I began writing The Occult.By now my attitude to the paranormal had changed, from amused scepticism to awillingness to take it seriously, and Joy was partly responsible for this. Shewas reading Osbert Sitwell’s autobiography, Great Morning, and showed me apassage relating to the period just before the outbreak of the First World War.A group of brother officers had been to see a celebrated palmist, but eachdescribed to Sitwell how she had looked bewildered and said: ‘I don’t understandit. After two or three months the line of life stops, and I can read nothing …’All these officers had been killed during the first months of the war.Sitwell’s father, Sir George Sitwell, had been famous for his scepticism – heenjoyed unmasking fake mediums. So Sitwell’s story impressed me. And after thisI came across case after case that seemed to exude an obvious authenticity –examples of precognition, telepathy, out-of-the-body experience, second sight,premonitions, and what Jung called synchronicities.An example of the latter occurred while I was writing the book. I needed somereference to alchemy, which I knew to be in a row of books opposite my desk.(They are still there thirty years later.) I was tired and did not want to makethe effort of dragging myself out of my chair – I was not even sure which bookit was. But I forced myself to stand up, and went and took a book off the shelf.And the book I was looking for fell off the shelf next to it, open at the rightpage.The same kind of thing happened as recently as this morning (27 July 2002). Ialways wake early, and today, opened my eyes soon after 4 o’clock. I beganthinking about this chapter of the book, and of the best way of explaining why Ihad become so convinced of the reality of the paranormal, and decided that Iought to emphasise synchronicity. I have a digital clock beside my bed, and whenwriting a book on UFOs a few years ago, noticed the strange frequency with whichit showed treble figures when I woke up in the night: 1.11, 2.22, 3.33, 4.44 …This morning, at this point, feeling uncomfortable on my left side, I stretchedand turned over. The clock was showing 4.44.Of course it could be coincidence. But when I was writing Alien Dawn, ithappened with such regularity that I began to feel it was more than that. And onthe day I was going to finish the book, I awoke some time after 4, wonderedabout the time, and again felt: I bet you what you like it’s 4.44. I turned overand indeed it was 4.44. After that it stopped happening, and now treble figureshave become a rarity – in fact, as often as I would expect from a one in sixtychance.When I had signed the contract for The Occult, I had expected to have to writeabout ghosts with their heads under their arms and families haunted by a bansheethat foretells death. And I am as naturally sceptical about such tales as anyscientist. But what happened when I began writing The Occult was that myemphasis began to change as I found myself stumbling on examples of unusualpowers of certain individuals.At one point I was writing about an example from Sir Alexander Ogston’sReminiscences of Three Campaigns. He was in a hospital suffering from typhoid,and in his fever the walls seemed transparent. He had ‘seen’ a surgeon of theMedical Corps in a remote part of the hospital who became very ill and died,after which his corpse was taken out silently by men in their socks, so hisdeath should not be generally known. When Ogston mentioned this to the nursingsisters, he was told that it had happened just as he had seen.I was particularly impressed by an incident related to the researcher Arthur W.Osborn (and recounted in The Future is Now) by a music master at a publicschool. He used to drive to London one afternoon a week to give piano lessons,and in the morning was standing by the piano, listening to a pupil playing Bach,when the music paper seemed to vanish, and he saw clearly a certain spot on theroad he would have to pass that afternoon. It was at a sharp bend in the road,and a car came round it so fast that it was on the wrong side.Imagining he had dozed off for a moment, he ignored this incident until he wason his way to London, approaching the same bend, when an instinct made him pullacross the road. A car swerved round the bend on the wrong side, and he wouldhave hit him head-on if he had stayed on his own side.These stories are, of course, anecdotal, and could not be regarded as validscientific evidence. But I also discovered many cases that have been verifiedand documented by many witnesses. This was the original aim of the Society forPsychical Research – to build up a body of documentation that demands to betaken seriously. And so, for example, two of its early publications, Phantasmsof the Living and Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death (each intwo massive volumes) contain hundreds of cases that have been exhaustivelywitnessed and documented.As I read dozens of books, it was suddenly clear to me that ‘the occult’ is areality, and that the only reason so many people refuse to accept it is that,unlike me, they have simply not taken the trouble to look into it. But then, Iwas in that same position before I began The Occult, and it was clearly my jobnow to spread as widely as possible my certainty that the paranormal is areality, and that the evidence for it is overwhelming.The odd thing is that even before beginning my research, I accepted certainincidents of the paranormal without question. For example, Yeats tells how hewas thinking intently about a fellow-student for whom he had a message. Two dayslater he received a letter from his friend, saying that he, Yeats, hadapproached him in a crowded hotel lobby, looking quite solid, and told him thathe had a message for him, and would return later. Yeats, the student said, hadthen returned in the middle of the night and given him the message. Yeats had noknowledge of any of this.I accepted this story as true before I wrote The Occult. So how could I feelvaguely sceptical about the paranormal? Obviously, I had not tried to face up tothe logical implications of my attitude. And that, I realised, is true of mostpeople.Yeats’s anecdote raises another question. If he could ‘appear’ to his fellowstudent, then why do we not all appear to people we think about? The answer liesin Yeats’s comment that he was thinking intently about his friend. Theimplication seems to be that our minds have far more power than we realise, butwe simply fail to make the effort that would trigger its activity. And ofcourse, we fail to make the effort because we are not aware of any such power.We simply don’t think about it. Therefore, it seemed to me, it is extremelyimportant that we should be persuaded to think about it.Why? What difference does it make? Well, I suspect that it could make a basicdifference to our picture of reality, and therefore to what we do with ourlives.Let me give an example. Graves’s story ‘The Abominable Mr Gunn’ speaks about themaths teacher at his public school. A boy called Smilley, who was in Graves’sclass, could see the answer to complex mathematical problems instantaneously.While the rest of the class was slaving away, Smilley would simply write downthe answer. When Mr Gunn asked how he obtained it, Smilley would say: ‘It justcame to me, sir.’ But Mr Gunn was convinced he was cheating, and sent him off tobe caned.The strange thing is that some people have this ability, and it is as baffling,in its way, as precognition. There is no simple method of telling whether alarge number is a prime (i.e. cannot be divided exactly by any other number, as13 or 23 cannot). So if you wanted to know if some giant number was a prime, youwould have to do it by patiently trying to divide it by every smaller number.Even a computer would have to do it ‘the long way’. Yet some calculatingprodigies can instantly tell if the number is a prime or not; the Canadianprodigy Zerah Colburn was able to state in seconds that a giant number was not aprime because it could be divided by 261.What Graves is implying is that our minds have some strange power of ‘knowing’things that cannot be solved by logic. And he gives a personal example. When hewas sitting on the roller outside the school cricket pavilion, ‘it occurred tome that I knew everything. I remembered letting my mind range rapidly over allits familiar subjects of knowledge, only to find that this was no foolish fancy.I did know everything. To be plain: though conscious of having come less than athird of the way along the path of formal education, and being weak inmathematics, shaky in Greek grammar, and hazy about English history, Inevertheless held the key of truth in my hand, and could use it to open the lockof any door. Mine was no religious or philosophical theory, but a simple methodof looking sideways at disorderly facts so as to make perfect sense of them.’Graves told me that the story was autobiographical when I was asking him whetherhe had ever had any experiences I might include in The Occult. Did he regard hisexperience as ‘mystical’, an insight that turned the universe – as opposed tohis own experience – into a unified whole? Clearly not. Otherwise he would nothave compared it to Smilley’s mathematical talent, which was plainlynon-mystical.I believe that Graves’s insight was of the same nature as some of my own, asdescribed in this book: that is, they suddenly made sense of one’s ownexperience. Graves was a schoolboy and, as he makes clear in otherautobiographical writing, a conventional, well-brought-up child. He accepted theworld of adult values. So a sudden glimpse of ‘Faculty X’, the ability to graspthe reality of other times and places, would indeed fit his description of ‘amethod of looking sideways at disorderly facts so as to make perfect sense ofthem’.This is why the paranormal is so important: because it implies that there issomething wrong with our ordinary plodding, rational way of looking at theuniverse. We are somehow leaving a whole dimension out of account – what Graveswould have called ‘lunar’ (intuitive) as opposed to ‘solar’ (rational)knowledge.The Occult turned into a very big book, as it had to. I had been commissioned towrite 150,000 words and ended by writing a quarter of a million. I often wroteten pages a day. The result was that the book took from mid-April 1970 untilmid-August. And a few days before I received the proofs, on 26 May 1971, ouryoungest son, Rowan, was born. I took it as a good omen for The Occult that hewas born on the sixteenth anniversary of the publication of The Outsider.My British publisher, Hutchinson, was apprehensive about its size, and suggestedthat I cut it by 100,000 words. The very idea outraged me. Fortunately, my agentDavid Bolt soon found another publisher, Hodder, who were not only untroubled byits size, but offered a larger advance. They even proposed to issue a pamphletabout the book and about me. I must admit that after years of indifferentreviews and unspectacular sales, I thought: poor devils, they’ll lose theirmoney.To my surprise and delight I was wrong. The Occult, dedicated to Robert Graves,came out on 4 October 1971, and received excellent reviews: Philip Toynbee inthe Observer, Cyril Connolly in the Sunday Times and Arthur Calder Marshall inthe Sunday Telegraph. Toynbee and Connolly had, of course, launched The Outsiderwith good reviews, and then had both recanted. Toynbee had called Religion andthe Rebel a rubbish bin. And here they were, virtually apologising. Toynbeebegan: ‘Colin Wilson has been much battered by reviewers, including, at times,the present one. But what nobody can deny is his staying power, his resilience,his indefatigable curiosity. The book under review seems to me to be marred bythe familiar faults, but it displays, more fully than any other Wilson book thatI have read since The Outsider, the full array of his amiable virtues.’ He wenton to compare me to ‘the headmaster of some appalling school who contrives, inhis innocence and benevolence, to find a good word in his report on even themost outrageous of his pupils …’Calder Marshall called it ‘the most interesting, informative andthought-provoking book on the subject I have read, and should secure Mr Wilson asuccess even greater than he won with The Outsider’.In the Sunday Times Cyril Connolly declared: ‘I am very impressed by this book,not only by its erudition but by the marshalling of it, and above all by thegood natured, unaffected charm of the author whose reasoning is never toofar-fetched, who is never carried away by preposterous theories. Mr Wilson’smental processes are akin to Aldous Huxley.’And so, after sixteen years in the wilderness, it seemed I was back again.Interestingly enough, my father had experienced a conviction that The Occult wasgoing to be a success from the moment I told him the title, and now it gave himsome satisfaction to say, ‘I told you so.’ I was also delighted on dad’s behalfbecause by 1971 it was clear that he was ill – he spent a great deal of timegoing in and out of hospitals, having stomach operations. I suspected that I wasto blame, for it had been my idea to get him to come and live in Cornwall in1957. Freedom had disoriented him so he ceased to enjoy it, and might well haveturned him into an alcoholic. But he hated his enforced return to Leicester andthe shoe factory, and his decline began from then.He died shortly before his sixty-fifth birthday, in August 1975. My mother waswith him at the end. She told me that his last words to her were: ‘I’ve had agood life.’ When she told me, I was incredulous. He had spent most of his adultlife at a workbench in a shoe factory. How could he say that he’d had a goodlife?But then, I wonder if, a few moments before dying, he experienced that sameflash of sheer affirmation as Tolstoy’s Ivan Ilyich, the sudden certainty thatthere is no such thing as death? It would certainly comfort me to think so."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19> BREAKDOWNI had been driving myself hard for years, with no sign of ill effect. In fact Ienjoyed hard work, and came to recognise myself as a workaholic. I also tookplenty of exercise, mowing the lawns, walking the dogs, and in the summerswimming in the sea.With three children, Joy had to work as hard as I did – especially during thesummer, when guests were inclined to arrive unannounced. The invasion usuallybegan at Easter (with my own family from Leicester), and continued untilSeptember or October. I often felt frayed, but Joy always seemed calm andgood-tempered.In December 1971, Westward, our local independent television station inPlymouth, asked me to drive up to discuss a new monthly arts programme. Wedecided it would be called Format: although the name meant nothing whatsoever,it was short and easy to remember. It was to be in three parts, one onliterature and music, one on theatre and cinema, one on art and architecture. Ipresented literature and music; the actor Jack Emery presented theatre, and acharming west-country character named Clive Gunnell presented art.Clive had had a traumatic experience in 1955. He had been walking out of theMagdala public house in Hampstead with a friend named David Blakely whenBlakely’s lover, a nightclub hostess called Ruth Ellis, shot him down with arevolver. And as Clive knelt over Blakely, she pointed the gun over his shoulderand fired more shots. She then pointed the gun at her own temple and pulled thetrigger, but it was empty. A jury found her guilty of murder and she was hanged– the last woman to be hanged in England. And the unfortunate Clive had anervous breakdown.Oddly enough, I was writing about the Ruth Ellis case, in a book called Order ofAssassins, when I was working with Clive on Format, and he was able to tell meseveral things about Ruth Ellis that I did not know – for example, that Blakelywas only one of several lovers.The first time the Format team got together in the studio to record theprogramme, I had an unnerving experience. As I stood in front of the camera,prepared to speak my lines, my heart began to pound, and my voice came outsounding choked and strangulated. The studio manager stopped the recording, andI apologised. We had to start my section all over again, which involved settingthe programme clock back to nought. And watching the hand click forward secondby second, my heart again began to pound, and again my voice trembled. Twicemore we tried it, and finally I managed to say my lines. Everyone wassupportive, but I felt deeply ashamed. And when I finally watched thetransmission, and my nervousness was obvious, I felt humiliated.What on earth, I wondered, was happening? My own explanation was that I hadspent the past ten years in a state of overwork, grinding out hundreds ofthousands of words, and trapped inside my own head. And now I was suddenlystanding in front of a camera in the glare of television lights; I felt like amole that has been dragged into the light of day.I asked my doctor if he could give me anything to calm my nerves. AndrewCrawshaw, an old friend and fellow-wine enthusiast, gave me some tranquillisers,and told me to take them just before we started recording. But he emphasisedthat I was only to take one at a time, and must on no account drink alcohol withthem or they would knock me out.On the next recording date, I had to drag myself to Plymouth, feeling like a manin front of a firing squad. I remembered that Shaw had felt a similarnervousness the first time he had gone to a social gathering to play the piano,and had had to walk around the block several times before he worked up courageto knock on the door. He commented that he would have run away ‘if I had notbeen instinctively aware that I must never let myself off in this manner if Imeant ever to do anything in the world’. I now thought about Shaw, and grittedmy teeth.We did a camera rehearsal in the morning, and I took a tranquilliser before webegan. It made no difference; I was as nervous as ever. So I went to the toiletand took another. It was still as bad. At lunchtime I drank several glasses ofwine, and before the recording took another tranquilliser. It all made not theslightest difference, and I had to fight a desire to run out of the studio as Iwatched the clock ticking towards the start of the opening music. And when itwas all over, I was aware that the tranquillisers had had no effect whatever.When I saw the transmission a few days later, I felt that my performance wasterrible, but that at least I did not look so terrified.Each month thereafter I went through the same struggle. When I was merely makinga preparatory interview – with guests such as Ken Russell or Spike Milligan – Iwas calm and normal, but as soon as I stepped into the studio, a watery sense ofpanic began to invade my stomach, and I had to resist the desire to flee.Every recording date brought the same fear, and the more I fought it, the worseit became. I was aware that what I ought to do was to employ what Viktor Franklcalled ‘the law of reverse effort’, deliberately trying to be nervous. But whenI came to stand in front of the camera, I had to struggle to make myself thinkof something else, and try not to trigger the flood of adrenaline into mybloodstream. Little by little, like a horse under fire, I began to get better atit.Since publication of The Occult my writing schedule had been as full as ever.First, the book on Maslow (who had died recently) called New Pathways inPsychology, written at his own suggestion; then Order of Assassins, a sequel tothe Casebook of Murder; then a police procedural novel called The SchoolgirlMurder Case, with a detective named Saltfleet; then a book about wine, whichbecame A Book of Booze. After that, I began to research a book about WilhelmReich.At least The Occult had improved our cash flow. The American edition had beentaken up by a book club and sold well; the British edition went into a biliousgreen paperback, with a stupid line on the cover declaring it was ‘a book forthose who would walk with the Gods’. When I went to Leicester to see my parents,and went into Lewis’s, the department store where I had met Joy, I found agigantic rack full of the paperback Occult in the window.Inevitably, the publisher of The Occult had asked me to write a sequel, and thiswas also commissioned by my American publisher, Random House. So far, it wasuntitled, and I had no idea of what it was going to be about.It was Joy who solved the problem. I had picked up a second-hand copy of a bookby T. C. Lethbridge called Witches, written in a casual, personal style by a manwho was obviously a scholar as well as an archaeologist and a dowser (in fact,he used his dowsing rod to explore archeological sites). I had sent Lethbridge acopy of The Occult, care of his publisher, but received a letter from his wifeMina saying her husband Tom had just died, and offering to return the book.Naturally, I told her to keep it, and we subsequently became friends.I now bought all the Lethbridge books in print, but it was Joy who read themfirst. She had made herself a divining rod out of two whalebones from an oldcorset, and proved to be an excellent dowser. And now, following Lethbridge’sadvice, she began to use a pendulum. And it was she who told me that Lethbridgehad discovered that if the pendulum was adjusted to different lengths, it woulddetect different substances. A twelve-inch pendulum would detect charcoal, atwenty-two-inch pendulum silver and lead, a twenty-nine-inch pendulum gold. Butit would also respond to emotions and ideas, such as sex (16) love (20) male(24) female (29). Lethbridge and Mina threw stones, and the pendulum wouldaccurately distinguish those thrown by Mina and those thrown by Tom.This seemed to me tremendously important, and I tried dowsing – with a rod –myself. I went down to the circle of standing stones called the Merry Maidens,and approached them holding the rod (which has two ‘arms’) with its ends turnedinward so as to impart a spring to it. As I drew near the stones, the rodtwisted upward in my hands. I tried it again and again to see whether I wascausing it by unconsciously changing pressure on the rod; the answer was no – itdid it anyway.Scientific tests have shown that what happens when the rod ‘twists’ is that ourstriped muscles contract. But it would seem that these muscles are responding tosome force from the standing stone or the ground. The conscious ‘I’ is unawareof the force, but the unconscious ‘me’ recognises it.When writing The Occult I had come to recognise that most of the secrets of theparanormal lie in the unconscious mind; synchronicities like the book fallingoff the shelf had taught me that this unconscious aspect of ‘me’ is far morepowerful than I realise. Now I felt I was learning some important basic secretof the universe. The ‘I’ who had despaired of the meaning of life in my teenshad been the rational, conscious layer of me, and now I was learning thatunderstanding the deeper meanings was a matter of relaxing and penetrating to adeeper layer entirely.This subconscious ‘other self’ sometimes proved useful. One morning, I had goneto pick up our cleaning lady in Mevagissey. About to make the difficult45-degree turn into our drive, I suddenly thought: wait – suppose the post vanis coming down the drive? In fact, this had never happened in all my years inTetherdown. But I slowed down and went into first gear. And the post van brakedwithin an inch of my bumper.By introducing me to the work of Lethbridge, Joy had increased my awareness ofthis unconscious component. In doing so, she had handed me the solution of theproblem of what the ‘occult sequel’ should be about.But I was still a long way from being ready to start it. I was writing the bookon wine, whose starting point was my suggestion that the discovery of alcohol,and the imaginative glow it induces, may have been one of the causes for theevolution of intelligence in our Cro-Magnon ancestors. I was also doing a greatdeal of television. (I had more or less conquered my attacks of panic, but stillhad difficulty overcoming that initial explosion of nerves.)I had added one more chore to my overcrowded schedule. In November 1972, Ibecame involved in plans to launch a part-work on crime. A part-work is amagazine that is designed to run to a specific number of issues, and thencollected and bound up in volumes to form an encyclopedia. An old friend namedJoe Gaute, a publisher who was also an expert on murder (with an amazing crimelibrary), came to stay with us, and we spent two days sketching out the planthat became the twenty-volume encyclopedia Crimes and Punishment. We decidedthat each 22-page issue (a hundred in all) should contain a famous murder case(such as Jack the Ripper), a famous trial (such as Landru) and a general articleon crime detection.At this time I was asked to join the panel of the South West Arts Association.They met once every six weeks in Exeter, from about eleven in the morning untilfour in the afternoon. Our chairman was the music critic Eric Walter White, andothers on the panel included the poets Ted Hughes, Peter Redgrove and RonaldDuncan, and the novelist Alexis Lykiard. Our job was to give away severalthousand pounds of the government’s money to such events as the CheltenhamFestival of Literature and various theatre companies in the West Country. To mysurprise I found I enjoyed working as part of a committee.Towards the end of February 1973, a new complication was introduced into my lifewith the arrival of Kathie, the American girl who had got drunk on the boat inLong Beach. She had invited herself to Cornwall for two weeks. I knew this wasgoing to be difficult, since she made no secret of being infatuated with me, andhad no inhibitions about showing it. In fact, one of the first things she saidto Joy as she came in was: ‘I’ve come now, so you can go.’ Joy, being a gentleand non-confrontational girl, only nodded and smiled as if Kathie had said goodafternoon.Kathie’s train arrived late, and she was in hysterics, having lost her case onthe journey from London. It arrived the following day, as we had assured her itwould, but meanwhile it cost us an enormous effort to soothe her.In the car, driving from the station, I had noticed that Kathie was wearing apeculiarly penetrating perfume that reminded me of a shoe factory. This, shetold us, was musk, and was designed to make the wearer irresistible to men.It was soon clear to me that the episode on the boat – when her skirt proved tohave a huge hole in the back – had been designed as an attempt at seduction.When Joy left us alone together on her second day in Cornwall, Kathie lost notime in placing her head on my knee, then raised her face to mine and said:‘Kiss me.’ I had no wish to appear a prude, and knew it would only provokehysterics if I refused, so I obliged. After some heavy tongue-probing, shegroaned and said: ‘I’d like to eat you.’ I assumed this was just a manner ofspeaking – as when a mother says it of her baby. But it seemed she meant it inthe American sense, and proceeded to unzip me.It was an impossible situation, for the average male finds it hard not torespond to a girl caressing his penis. Fortunately, there was the sound of thecar engine as Joy returned from school with the children, and Kathie hastilywithdrew to her own chair. But I realised this was going to be a problem for thenext fortnight. I certainly did not wish to become Kathie’s lover – common sensetold me it would be disastrous. But neither did I want to spend two weeksrepelling amorous advances, like Fielding’s Joseph Andrews – it would have feltsilly and undignified.From then on, Kathie would seize her opportunity when we were in the car,unzipping my fly, and observing with satisfaction that my penis automaticallystiffened. And I would say something like: ‘That lorry driver will be able tosee straight into the car when we pull alongside,’ and she would restore me todecency. But as soon as we were on the open road again, her fingers would movedown to my zip. If the road was really empty she would bury her face in my lap.I found being fellated an oddly nondescript sensation.When she realised that I had no intention of going further, and regretted havinggone so far, she began throwing hysterical fits, and telling us that sheintended to commit suicide during the night. Although heartily sick of her,neither of us wanted that to happen, and I was forced to relent and try to showaffection. Joy, of course, knew exactly what was going on – I told her thatevery time she left us alone, Kathie would reach for my trousers. She seemed tofind it all mildly funny, and in any case, obviously felt that it was my ownfault.That two weeks seemed an eternity. I would take Kathie out for a drive to somepicturesque town like St Mawes, and do my best to talk her into good spirits,and after a while, feeling that she was engaging my full attention, she wouldbecome cheerful and normal. But by mid-afternoon she was depressed again, and byevening was having hysterical attacks and threatening suicide.The day Kathie left, I was due to drive to Exeter for a meeting of the Artspanel. Significantly, she presented Joy with her bottle of musk perfume as shesaid goodbye. Then I took her to the train and kissed her goodbye, telling hernot to cry, waving to her as the train left, and then climbed into the car witha sudden marvellous sense of freedom.Alas, this soon evaporated. When I tried to get out of the car in Exeter, I wasunable to straighten my back. I clambered on to the pavement on all fours –luckily the small back street was empty – then pulled myself to my feet bygrasping the wing mirror, and I limped to my meeting. When I got home thatevening, Joy offered to give me a ‘back walk’ – which meant I had to lie on therug while she sat in her armchair and moved her feet up and down my spine. Thisonly made it worse – when I woke up in the morning it took me five minutes tostand up. I had to roll off the bed and get up on all fours.I assumed – rightly, I believe – that the unconscious was at work, and that Iwas paying for two weeks of self-division with Kathie. For the back pains cameand went quite unpredictably. When I went to London to lecture at Scotland Yard(about the role of dominance in crime), all my pains vanished as I talked, anddid not return that day. But when, on the night train, I mistook Bodmin Roadstation for St Austell, and rushed frantically to get dressed, it all came backagain and I arrived home unable to bend.The back pains lasted about a month, then vanished as abruptly as they came.As to Kathie, we saw her only once more, when I was lecturing in Milwaukee in1987. She was living with a boyfriend, but when we took them out to dinner shetreated me as her own property. She committed suicide with an overdose ofsleeping tablets about two years later. The meetings in London for the crime part-work continued, interspersed with daysat Westward Television and committee meetings of South West Arts. I alsofinished my ‘Maigret’, The Schoolgirl Murder Case. I had been hoping, likeSimenon, to be able to learn the technique of writing a detective novel in a fewweeks, and then being able to return to more serious work for the rest of theyear. But I found that writing detective fiction bored me, and after one moreattempt, gave it up.Crimes and Punishment had been holding fire because the backers – Longines –were taking time to make up their minds. But in June 1973, they finally gave thego-ahead, and I was asked to write my first article – on sex killers – for thefirst issue. They were paying £75 for a 3,000-word article, not bad pay for thattime, when I hoped to make £7,500 a year. A hundred articles for Crimes andPunishment would bring that much without even writing a book.I was the only member of the editorial team who had the general knowledge – andthe research skills – to cover subjects from piracy to war crimes, espionage togangsters. This is why I was the obvious choice to write the leading article ineach issue. And provided I had the material at hand, I could write a 3,000-wordarticle in two days.Looking at my diary for this period, I see that many days are left empty. Thiswas because the part-work publishers were increasing the pace, and I had no timeto fill it in. From one or two articles a week, I was soon having to write threeor four. That meant I could no longer take a leisurely two days for eacharticle; it had to be written in a day, starting at eight in the morning. Onesign of this increasing strain was frequent sexual failure.On 11 July 1973, my diary records that I attended the magistrates’ court inTruro to get a divorce from Betty. She had always refused to divorce me, but nowthat we had been separated for almost twenty years, I was able to divorce her.And since I had found half the money for her to buy a house, and our sonRoderick was now twenty-two, I had no further financial obligation to her. (She,in any case, worked as a school nurse.) I often felt guilty about her, for Istill felt protective, but there was little I could do. I could certainly nothave said to Joy; ‘Off you go now – I’m going back to my wife.’It was Joy’s mother who had insisted on the divorce, and paid for it. (Joy’sfather had unfortunately died earlier in the year.) Joy, oddly enough, was lessthan enthusiastic about legalising her status. Since we had been perfectly happyfor twenty years in an unmarried state, she was afraid that becoming a wifemight bring bad luck. Fortunately, she proved to be wrong. We married a fewweeks later, our daughter playing truant from school so she could come to theregistry office.In late July, a Dutchman called Slot came to Tetherdown to study thebiographical tapes Maslow had recorded for me; our friend Kay put him up. Hewent off a week later taking the tapes with him, as well as all Kay’s signedcopies of my books. We never heard from him again.By this time, the publisher of Crimes and Punishment was demanding sevenarticles a week. This was appallingly hard work, since it also involvedresearch. (The London Library here proved invaluable.) But at least I wasearning more than £500 a week – which was as much as my publisher used toadvance me on a single book.Then the publisher rang me to say they needed ten articles a week – 30,000words, which amounts to about a third of the average book. But on the £750 aweek this paid me I felt rich. I would begin an article at 8 o’clock in themorning, finish it by two in the afternoon, and begin another articleimmediately, writing a half before the end of the day.Although I was overworked, I was taking it all in my stride. The only problemthat worried me was the influence on my sex life. With increasing frequency, Ibegan to experience what Stendhal calls ‘le fiasco’. But even that was worth itfor £750 a week.The breaking point came when two young men from the National BroadcastingCorporation of Canada came to interview me. They were both very talkative, withthe result that when I went to bed at 11.30, I had drunk far too much wine,listened to far too much boring conversation, and knew I had a busy day in frontof me. This began early, with more interviewing for NBC, after which I had tohave a passport photograph taken. On my return I did some lawn-mowing, and wrotethe last five pages of a book called Strange Powers. Then the Spectator rang meto ask if I could do a book review in a hurry, and the editor of Audio magazinerang to ask me for an article about Verdi for the following week.In the evening I took Joy and Kay out to dinner, then to see the film Cabaret,and was in bed before midnight. I woke up at four in the morning, and beganthinking about the review I had to do, the Audio piece, and seven articles I hadto write for Crimes and Punishment. I felt tired and overtense, and unable torelax. It was as if I was lying there holding my breath. It even came into myhead that perhaps I should go down to my workroom and begin one of the articles,but realised that this would be the first step towards a nervous breakdown anddismissed the idea.As I lay fighting this increasing tension, my heart began to beat faster.Suddenly, the blood rushed to my head, and my cheeks and ears began to burn. Andat that point I made a serious mistake: I tried to overcome the problem bywillpower. My heart began to pound so fast that I was afraid I was having aheart attack.I went to the kitchen and got a drink of orange juice, then sat on the lavatoryand looked at a classical atlas until I began to feel calmer. Then I went backto bed. Instantly, I felt strangely light-headed, as if my head was swellinglike a balloon. With a buzzing noise in my ears, I went into the sitting room,and tried to read. But there was an underlying feeling that something terriblehad happened, as if I had had a heart attack or a stroke. I was now trying tosoothe myself like a frightened horse. But undermining these attempts was a fearin case all this signalled a nervous breakdown, and that I would have to tell mypublisher that I could write no more articles. And the fear reinforced itself,so I became afraid of fear itself.In Savage Sleep, Millen Brand had talked about psychotics going into ‘exhauststatus’, and I could now see how easily this could happen. My energies wererushing away, as if someone had opened the floodgates of a dam.From somewhere outside I could hear the bleating of sheep, and the thought oflambs being reared, then slaughtered to provide human beings with their dinner,seemed horrible. It was as if the whole world reeked of innocent blood.Finally, just before dawn, I decided to go back to bed. It was clear to me thatI had to stop this energy-leak. So I lay beside Joy, staring at the grey squareof the window, and refusing to allow my thoughts to move, as if holding mybreath. And finally I dropped off to sleep.I woke up feeling exhausted and uneasy. I did not tell Joy about the ‘panicattack’; there seemed no point in worrying her, and she would only beg me tostop working so hard. Instead, after a light breakfast (we usually had tea andtoast in bed), I went downstairs, and wrote an account of what had happened inmy journal. This calmed me and restored a sense of normality, and I went on anddid my usual day’s work. By afternoon I felt quite normal and cheerful.The problem came back in the evening, when I was tired. I began to worry in casethe panic should start again when I went to bed. It was like the panic I hadexperienced in the previous year facing the television camera – an irrationalnervousness in which fear seemed to feed on itself. And indeed, after half anhour in bed, I was more wide awake than ever. I began to think with nostalgia ofthe days when I could climb into bed and fall asleep immediately. It seemedhorribly ironic that I had based my life on the belief that consciousness couldbe controlled, and that I now seemed further from it than ever before.The day after the attack, I worked as hard as ever on an article on traitors,and the day after that wrote the piece on Verdi, and another crime article. Thenext day I wrote the Spectator review (on primitive religious movements), andover the next few days wrote five more articles.My journal records that I continued to have milder versions of the first panicattack, particularly if I was overtired. In that case, it rose in me as if I wasgoing to be sick, and I had to struggle to repress it, like someone strugglingto close a door that is blowing open in a gale. And even when I should have beenrelaxed, sitting in my armchair drinking a glass of wine, it was horribly easyto slip into ‘negative feedback’ in which fatigue and anxiety entered into aconspiracy to drag me down into a state of gloom. When that happened, it wasimportant to apply the lesson I had learned that first day, when I wrote it alldown. As soon as I could feel detached, my identity was transferred to a higherlevel of control, and suddenly everything was fine.The problem was that as soon as I yawned and became forgetful, I was suddenlyback in the ‘basement’ again. It was exactly like being two people.I learned that if it happened in the middle of the night, the best way ofdealing with it was to wake myself up fully. I recognised that basically allthis fear was an absurdity, that what was happening was something I was causingmyself. I called this trick ‘the schoolmistress effect’ because it was like aschoolmistress walking into a room full of quarrelling children, and clappingher hands – and suddenly there is instant silence.So I continued to push myself hard, and in the first week of October wrote tencrime articles. Then I took the family on a holiday to France, and we drovearound Normandy. We went on to Tours and Chinon, then to see Urbain Grandier’schurch in Loudun. Looking at the spot where Grandier had been burned alive, itstruck me that I really had nothing to complain about, and I felt suddenlyrelieved and cheerful. This was the technique that I called ‘the St Neot Margintrick’ – pushing the mind to a higher level by recognising that things could beten times as bad.The attacks continued for months – in fact, my pocket diary has no furtherentries for the remainder of 1973 because my energies were so low. But a visitfrom Bob DeMaria cheered me up. He told me he had also been through a period ofpanic attacks, and had gone to see a psychiatrist about them. This man washonest enough to say: ‘Look, I could charge you a lot of money to try to findwhat is causing the trouble. But it would be wasted, because panic attacks neverlast more than six months anyway.’ And, said Bob, he proved to be right.In fact, by fighting hard to maintain control, I could minimise the attacks. Butit was an exhausting business. For much of the time I was in the state thatGraham Greene described before his Russian roulette experiment – a feeling ofgreyness and suffocation. Yet it could disappear quite suddenly. One day, when Ihad been struggling with this feeling of tiredness and fatigue, I began to chopwood for the fire and, as I split the logs, cautioned myself to be careful,since it would be disastrous to chop off the end of a typing finger. Theoppression burst and, by the time I made the fire, I was feeling perfectlynormal again.On another occasion, I was staying with John Michell, before returning toCornwall. John, the author of The View Over Atlantis, lived in Notting Hill, andwas an old friend of Bill Hopkins. In the middle of the night, I was suddenlyoverwhelmed with a feeling of alienness, of ‘what am I doing here?’ and thesinking feeling that was the beginning of a panic attack. I wrestled with ituntil dawn, then sneaked out of the house, leaving a note apologising for notstaying for breakfast, and took the next train back to Cornwall.One day in the midst of all this I began to urinate blood, and was afraid thatit might be cancer of the bladder. But a hospital check revealed that it wassimply a few gallstones, which were removed.One of the worst attacks came when I was on my way back from London on the nightsleeper, having chaired a Savage Club dinner. After a brief doze, I woke up, andagain the sense of alienness plunged me into a panic attack. It was a feelinglike milk boiling over, and a fear that if it went too far, I would collapseinto ‘exhaust status’ and be permanently damaged. The simplest solution seemedto be to get off the train at the next stop, and walk until I felt calm again.This decision helped release some of the tension. But half an hour later it wasclear that the next station was going to be a long way ahead. By this time, Ihad fought off the rising panic, and succeeded in relaxing a little. Furtherstruggles gradually brought me back to a sense of normality. And at that point,I had the thought: if I have been able to relax myself this far, why not simplygo on relaxing? I did this, focusing all my attention on shallow breathing,until I felt so calm that my heart seemed to have stopped beating. And it was atthat point that it dawned on me that I had, in fact, solved the problem of thepanic attacks: the answer lay in teaching myself how to induce this deep feelingof relaxation, then using it as a springboard for optimism.A few days later I learned another method. One afternoon, at about five o’clock,in a state of fatigue and depression, I was driving down to the postbox –driving because the post left in five minutes. Halfway down the drive, I saw acar shoot past the end, and reflected suddenly what it would be like if I hadfailed to brake in time, gone a foot too far, and been hit by the car. Thethought of the massive inconvenience of swopping insurance companies andaddresses suddenly jerked me to a higher level of alertness, and the tirednessand depression vanished. And once I had got the hang of this ‘trick’, the panicattacks virtually ceased.But they had left behind a great deal of fatigue, and I noted this when we spentthree months in Philadelphia in the late spring of 1973. Again, I had beenoffered the post of ‘visiting professor’, and we swapped houses with a professorwho was on a sabbatical. We lived in a pleasant northern suburb of Philadelphiain a clapboard house, and on most days of the week I drove downtown to takeclasses at Rutgers University, in the area where Walt Whitman had once lived. Iwas also writing a few articles for Crimes and Punishment, although this hadalmost run its course. At the end of a day’s work, I often felt so drained thatI could do nothing but collapse into a chair and listen to music or watchtelevision. Once, when I had been invited out to a local club for dinner, thewhole evening passed in a state of disconnection and unreality, as I struggledwith sheer exhaustion.It was at Rutgers that I shared a platform with Allen Ginsberg and was struckagain by a thought that had occurred to me repeatedly at Hollins and in Seattle– that living in America would be a far more relaxed form of existence thanchurning out book after book. Allen was able to lead a pleasant, casual lifewandering around campuses. The only thing that bothered me about that notion wasthe prospect of leaving my parents behind, and all the books and records I hadaccumulated in the past eighteen years.After Philadelphia, we accepted an invitation from my Arab publisher to go toBeirut. I was aware that my books had been pirated in the Arab countries foryears. But my Beirut publisher, Dr Idries, now offered to pay me royalties inexchange for a written agreement naming him as my only official publisher, andhe gave me £500 for my signature.Flying over the Mediterranean there was another of those minor synchronicitiesthat interested me. I had remarked casually to Joy that we ought to be flyingover the island of Santorini, which the archaeologist Marinatos thought might bethe site of Atlantis. (The measurements were oddly similar to those Plato hadgiven, except reduced tenfold, and the suggestion was that some copyist hadadded a nought too many to Plato’s text.) Just as I said this, Joy pointedbelow. ‘There it is!’ (The same thing had happened when we were flying overArizona and I remarked that perhaps we would see the meteorite crater – itproved to be right below.)When we landed in Beirut, the stewardess came and told us that we were to be thefirst off the plane, and shepherded us to the door. We were puzzled until weclimbed down the steps, and found that we were being met by a deputation thatwas headed by the mayor of Beirut, and that we had to walk beside him down a redcarpet. It was then that I discovered for the first time that I was one of themost widely read foreign authors in the Middle East. This was confirmed a fewdays later when our Palestinian hosts drove us to Damascus, and took us to thehouse of the Syrian War Minister, General Tlas. The general told me how, when heand his brother officers had been imprisoned by the previous regime, they hadread the Arabic edition of my Ritual in the Dark by tearing out the pages andpassing them from hand to hand, so they could all read it at once.After our return home, I received an invitation to Iran for a lecture tour.(This, of course, was in the days of the Shah.) But it struck me as pointless tolecture in a country where everything I said would have to be translated, so Ideclined.Soon after our visit to Beirut – whose relaxed and civilised atmosphereimpressed us – the city was overtaken by the Arab–Israeli conflict, and mypublisher went out of business. The panic attacks had started a train of thought that was to prove highlyfruitful for my next book, the ‘Occult sequel’. For it was very obvious to methat these attacks had pushed me up to a higher level of self-control. If aglass fell on the floor and broke, I did not even flinch. It then struck me thatmost people never mature beyond a certain stage. A point comes where they feelthey have learned all they have to learn, and from then on they livemechanically and repetitively, doing their daily work and then relaxing in theevenings and weekends.These panic attacks had achieved for me what the ‘double ambiguity’ experimenthad achieved for Rubinstein and Best’s planaria, forcing them to make greaterefforts as a matter of habit. They had forced me to overcome my own‘mechanicalness’.At that time, I had been approached by the BBC to introduce a series oftelevision programmes called A Leap in the Dark, each of which told a tale ofthe paranormal, usually filmed on location: stories of ghosts, poltergeists,precognition, second sight, and so on. One of these programmes was a strangetale of multiple personality involving a patient whom Dr Morton Prince, whorecorded the case, disguised under the name of Christine Beauchamp (actually itwas Clara Fowler). After a bad shock that plunged her into depression, Christinebegan to experience periods of amnesia, during which she could be taken over bya personality who called herself Sally – a bright, mischievous child who lovedplaying tricks. Sally would ‘take over’ Christine’s body and go for a long walkin the country, and Christine would ‘wake up’ and find herself far from home.The problem of Christine Beauchamp, and the dozens of other cases of multiplepersonality that have been recorded, fascinated me, for they all originated indepression – just like my panic attacks. I had pulled myself out of thisdepression by deliberate concentration, and seemed to have created a strongerpersonality. This left me wondering: do we all contain many ‘selves’, manypersonalities? After all, we grow up from childhood through a whole series of‘selves’, and the person who emerges – for example, in adolescence – is almostlike a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis. Do we have many stages, like abutterfly? And could that explain what happened to Christine Beauchamp, whodeveloped two other distinct personalities beside Sally?It seemed to me that our biological urges transport us up the lower rungs of the‘ladder of selves’, and it costs us no real effort to develop through childhoodto adolescence and adulthood. But at that point, the life force ceases tosubsidise our development; if we want to go on developing, we have to do it bypainful effort, what Gurdjieff calls ‘intentional suffering’.It is as if the ‘ladder of selves’ is not like a normal ladder, with parallelsides, but more like an elongated triangle. The higher you go, the shorter therungs become, and the more effort you have to compress yourself into the nextrung. Of course, most people see no reason whatever why they should make anyeffort. If they can establish a stable lifestyle, with a home and family, theyare perfectly contented to remain for the rest of their lives on the same rung.But some people dislike remaining static. They experience an obscure inner urgeto go on climbing. These are the people I had labelled ‘Outsiders’.In that sense, the ‘Occult sequel’ could be regarded as an extension of my earlywork.When I was three quarters of the way through the book, I came upon a piece ofinformation that had a tremendous impact on my theory of the paranormal. Afriend named Ira Einhorn, whom I had met in Philadelphia, arrived at my housewith a book called The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the BicameralMind, by Julian Jaynes. And what that book had to say about the left and rightside of the brain came to me as a revelation.A science called split-brain physiology leaves no doubt that we all have twopeople living inside our heads, in the right and left hemispheres of the brain.The one who lives in the left deals with language and logic – you might say heis a scientist. The one who lives in the right deals with shapes and patterns –you might say he is an artist. But the person you call ‘you’ is the scientist.When doctors trying to prevent epileptic fits decided to split the brain – bysevering the knot of nerves that join the two halves – they quickly discoveredthat ‘you’ lives in the left hemisphere. If a split-brain patient bumped into atable with the left side of the body – which happens to be connected to theright brain – he did not notice it.A patient whose left brain had been destroyed would not be able to speak, butcould still recognise faces and appreciate art and music. A patient whose rightbrain had been destroyed would be able to speak normally, but his sense ofbeauty and meaning would be non-existent.I had already concluded that we have an ‘other self’ inside us, and that thisother self is responsible for paranormal faculties like dowsing, telepathy,precognition and ‘second sight’. Now it seemed to me that this ‘other self’might be the right brain. And obviously, the right brain is very closely linkedwith the unconscious mind.When, in due course, I began writing the ‘Occult sequel’, I began with anaccount of my panic attacks, then went on to develop the theory of the ‘ladderof selves’, or ‘hierarchy of personalities’, with accounts of many cases ofmultiple personality. In The Occult I had pointed out that many poets – perhapsthe majority – seem to possess paranormal abilities. Now I was raising thequestion: could such abilities be explained by this concept of a hierarchy ofselves?I then went on to tell the story of Tom Lethbridge, and his belief, based on hisexperiments with the pendulum, that there are also many levels of realityco-existing with this one.The ‘Occult sequel’ appeared in August 1978 under the title Mysteries. It wenton to sell well in England and America. I was no longer publishing with RandomHouse because an editor there had asked me to cut the book from a quarter of amillion words to 150,000, and since I had done so much work on it, and wasconvinced of its importance, I was unwilling to scrap a hundred thousand words.So I transferred to Putnams, and under their imprint Mysteries finally went onto sell very nearly as many copies as The Occult.These two works of the 1970s, The Occult and Mysteries, had established myreputation as a writer on the paranormal, and the BBC Leap in the Dark serieswas only one of many projects in which I became involved. Another was a seriesof books called A New Library of the Supernatural, published by Aldus Books,which was run by a charming Viennese called Wolfgang Foges.I would take the night sleeper to Paddington, arriving at 5.30 in the morning,then take a taxi or walk to Queen’s Gardens, where Bill Hopkins had a groundfloor flat. He would leave the key for me under a dustbin in the basement area,and I would let myself in, and get another two hours sleep on a bed-settee thathis wife Carla had made up for me.It was when dozing off one morning that I had a kind of semi-dream in which Isaw a vast spaceship. It was fifty miles long and two miles high, and full ofholes made by space debris.I woke up immediately, thinking: my God! A kind of Dracula’s castle in the sky!and in a quarter of an hour had planned my next novel, The Space Vampires.I told Bill and Carla the plot over breakfast. A spacecraft exploring theasteroid belt becomes aware of this giant space derelict, which probably set outcenturies ago from another galaxy, and was struck by a meteor.A scouting party enters a hole torn in its side, and finds itself in a kind ofvast metal cathedral, with columns as tall as skyscrapers, and immense catwalksthat stretch over gulfs.A greenish glow leads them to the centre of the ship, where they find a square,transparent building. Inside this are human beings in glass coffins – probablyin suspended animation.Three of these are taken back to earth for examination – two males and a female,all naked. But they seem to be dead. An enterprising reporter succeeds ingetting into the isolation unit, and is obviously excited by the beauty of thewoman’s body. He caresses her breast, then bends over her, obviouslycontemplating necrophilia. But as his lips touch hers, there is a flash, and hewrithes in agony, and sinks to the floor. And the woman sits up slowly in hercoffin. The face of the reporter has changed into that of an old man – the womanhas sucked the life force out of his body. And when guards arrive a few minuteslater, all three humanoids have vanished.The girl is found in Hyde Park, strangled and raped, apparently the victim of asex crime. It is only later that investigators realise that the female vampirehas simply changed bodies with a man, then raped and strangled herself.The problem: how to catch vampires who can change bodies at will …?A few hours later, after my board meeting at Aldus, I called on my publisher,Mark Barty-King, whose office was only two blocks away, and told him the story.He commissioned the book. And in due course, it became the first of my novels tobe filmed.It was Wolfgang Foges, the managing director of Aldus Books, who asked me to flyto Barcelona to spend a few days with the psychic Uri Geller – Foges wanted meto write a book about him. It was through Geller that I became convinced beyondall doubt that certain individuals possess psychic powers.In fact, I had already met Geller when the impresario Robert Stigwood asked meto write a film script about him. Uri and I went out to lunch, and he quicklydemonstrated his ability to bend spoons by rubbing them gently. But that, Irealised, could have been sleight of hand – I had already seen Geller’s chiefdetractor, ‘the Amazing Randi’, do the same thing without claiming paranormalpowers. But Uri then went on to do something that left me completely convinced.He asked me to make a drawing on the back of the menu card. He turned away whileI did this, and I watched him carefully to make sure he could not see what I wasdrawing. This was a little cartoon character I had invented to amuse mychildren, which I called a ‘woozie’. When I had finished it, Uri asked me tocover it with my hand, then asked me to stare into his eyes and try to transmitthe drawing. I followed his instructions, re-drawing it in my head. And aftersome hesitation, Uri seized a pencil and reproduced my ‘woozie’. I could have nodoubt whatever that he had read my mind.So when I flew to Barcelona to meet Uri, I already knew what to expect. Over twodays, I witnessed several strange events, like a light bulb falling from theempty air, and a broken spoon pinging past us as we walked downstairs.Since that visit I have met Uri so many times, and witnessed so many strangephenomena that I do not have the slightest doubt of his genuineness.I duly wrote my book about Uri. And when it came to the matter of explaining hispeculiar powers, I reached what then seemed to me a logical conclusion, based onmy own theories of the paranormal. I was firmly convinced that poltergeists –‘banging ghosts’ – are due to the unconscious powers of disturbed teenagers. Ihad even made a television programme about a poltergeist that caused havoc in alawyer’s office in the German town of Rosenheim: it had made electric lightsbulbs fall out of their sockets, shattered neon tubes, moved filing cabinets andturned pictures on the walls. The paranormal investigator Hans Bender, whom Iinterviewed for the programme, had no doubt that all this was caused by‘spontaneous psychokinesis’ (mind over matter), centred on a teenage filingclerk called Anne-Marie Schaberl, who had a psychologically disturbedbackground. And when Anne-Marie moved elsewhere, the ‘poltergeist’ followed her.As a result of that case, I had come to accept that poltergeists are caused bythe unconscious minds of disturbed adolescents. And since many of the phenomenathat happened when Uri was around looked very like poltergeist effects, Iconcluded that Uri’s own unconscious mind must be causing spoons to bend andlight bulbs to fall out of the air.Shortly after the programme on Rosenheim, I had received a letter from a Bristolpsychic who called herself Madame Rose, and who assured me that the Rosenheimpoltergeist was the spirit of a murdered girl, with whom she herself had been incontact. In my reply, I explained that I was inclined to reject the notion thatpoltergeists are ghosts, and that I favoured the ‘spontaneous psychokinesis’explanation: I had no doubt that she was talking superstitious nonsense.And so in Mysteries I had continued to argue that most paranormal events are aform of unconscious psychokinesis. It is true that psychokinesis usually takesplace on an extremely small scale – the Russian Nina Kulagina could movefragments of coloured paper by staring at them, while the American FeliciaParise could move corks. Uri could move a compass needle by staring at it.Moving filing cabinets, as the Rosenheim poltergeist did, is quite outside thepowers of these psychics.But then, I had seen a dowser using a huge fallen branch of a tree as a diviningrod, from which I reasoned that earth energies can have tremendous force whencanalised through a dowser, so perhaps the energies of the poltergeist came fromthe earth?Of course, most modern psychical investigators held the view that poltergeistswere manifestations of the minds of disturbed teenagers, so I was in respectablecompany.I was about to be forced to change my mind.In the summer of 1980, I received a phone call from a local historian who livedin Pontefract. He asked me if I would be interested in collaborating with him ona book about a local poltergeist case. It had taken place in the 1960s in thehouse of a couple called Joe and Jean Pritchard, and the poltergeist had smashedjust about every breakable item in the house.It sounded fascinating, and I decided to go and see for myself.Joy and I set out in late August, 1980. Since I had been invited to lecture onthe paranormal at the Hayes Conference Centre at Swanwick, in Derbyshire, wespent the night there on the way. I noted that one of my fellow speakers wouldbe Guy Lyon Playfair, with whom I had exchanged a few friendly letters, and Ilooked forward to meeting him. But it turned out that he was not going to arriveuntil about 3 o’clock on Sunday afternoon, and we had hoped to be on the road bythat time. However, I decided that meeting Guy was more important than gettingto Yorkshire, so we stayed around until mid-afternoon. In retrospect I can seeit as one of the most important decisions of my life.Guy finally arrived – a slim, fair-haired man of about my own age, withsomething vaguely military about him. I was not surprised to learn that hisfather was an army officer.I told him that we were on our way to investigate a poltergeist case inYorkshire, and then asked casually: ‘What do you think poltergeists are?’‘Footballs,’ said Guy, without the suspicion of a smile.‘Footballs?’ I could hardly believe my ears.Guy went on to explain that when people get upset and frustrated, they oftenexude a kind of vital energy, which forms itself into droplets, like rain. But,being so much lighter than water, this energy forms droplets the size offootballs.Still baffled, I asked: ‘But how does that smash things?’‘Well, a couple of spirits with nothing else to do come wandering past thewindow and see the football. And, like bored schoolboys, they go and kick itaround, smashing windows and knocking ornaments off the mantelpiece.’‘So poltergeists are spirits?’‘Oh yes, I think so.’And then, said Guy, the football turns into a pool of water …He went on to explain that poltergeist cases always follow a certain pattern.They may begin with scratching noises, like rats under the floorboards. Thencome pools of water. Then bangs and raps. Then the movement of objects – thingsappear and disappear. Sometimes poltergeists graduate to whisking off thebedclothes and throwing people out of bed.Not all cases, he explained, include each of these stages; some of the stagesmay be missed. But they always follow in the same order.And at that point, I suggested, an exorcist may have to be called in.Guy shook his head. ‘Poltergeists usually ignore exorcism.’As Joy and I drove away towards Pontefract, I shook my head. ‘Poor chap – he’sas mad as a hatter.’The following day, we called at the home of the Pritchards, who had arranged forme to interview various people who had been involved in the case which had endedsome ten years earlier. We listened with amazement to tape recordings of theincredible racket the thing made – like a mad drummer.It was when I asked Jean Pritchard: ‘How did it all begin?’ and she said: ‘Well,there were these odd pools of water on the kitchen floor …’ that I rememberedwhat Guy had said – and suddenly knew that he knew far more about poltergeiststhan I did.And when the Pritchards’ daughter Diane described how the poltergeist haddragged her upstairs by her throat, leaving dark bruises, I knew beyond alldoubt that this was not her own unconscious mind – it was some kind of ‘spirit’.In other words, a poltergeist was a ghost that could express itself by using theenergy exuded by upset and disturbed people, often teenagers on the verge ofadolescence, and seething with explosive sexual energies.As I drove back to Cornwall, I realised that my whole theory of the paranormalhad been stood on its head.To begin with, if ‘spirits’ really existed, then presumably they had to bespirits of dead people. In which case, there could be no avoiding the conclusionthat there must be life after death.I was reluctant to take this leap, which went against my natural scientificscepticism. But unless I could think of some other plausible explanation of thePontefract case, there was no honest alternative. And the more I studied otherpoltergeist cases, the more I had to conclude that they pointed to life afterdeath.Moreover, Guy Playfair’s experiences as a member of the Brazilian equivalent ofthe Society for Psychical Research left him in no doubt that ‘black magic’ alsoworks, and that this again involves ‘spirits’. According to Guy, local witchdoctors – ‘umbanda’ specialists – can put spells on people by conjuring upspirits, and the only way to get rid of the spell is to call in another umbandamagician to take it off again.Spirits, black magic, witch doctors – whether I liked it or not, I seemed to beplunging deeper and deeper into a world of wild absurdity, which any civilisedwesterner would reject with contempt. Yet as I reflected on the experiences thathad led me to this conclusion, none of them left the slightest room for doubt.There was worse to come. Guy told me that one of the most important books onsuch matters was The Secret Science Behind Miracles by Max Freedom Long. I hadactually seen it on the shelves of Watkins’s bookshop off the Charing CrossRoad, but had found the title so offputting that I had not even glanced at it.Now I bought it and found that it was, as Guy had said, a pivotal work foranybody wanting to understand the paranormal.Long was an American schoolmaster who arrived in Hawaii in 1917, and becameinterested in its ancient Huna religion, which had been virtually displaced byChristianity. Its priests, called Kahunas, were said to be able to kill enemiesby a ‘death prayer’. Long discovered the diary of a Christian minister who hadchallenged a Kahuna magician to a contest of prayers, and the diary describedhow member after member of his congregation died mysteriously. Finally, theminister persuaded someone to teach him the death prayer, and the magician diedwithin three days.Long discovered that, according to the Kahunas, man possesses three souls orminds: the lower, the middle and the higher self. The lower self correspondsroughly to Freud’s Unconscious, the middle self is our ordinary everydayconsciousness, and the higher self is the super-conscious mind, which canforesee the future.Long mentions that the three souls are literally distinct personalities, andthat the low self – which he calls ‘George’ – has the natural penetration of achild, and can recognise instinctively when people are untrustworthy ordishonest. When Long needed advice about some new acquaintance, he askedGeorge’s opinion, and invariably found the answers correct.After death, the three selves may become separated, and the lower self oftenbecomes a poltergeist. The middle self may become a ghost.Long also discusses multiple personality, and cites a typical case of aCalifornia girl with two personalities, which took over the body for years at atime. When a psychiatrist tried to integrate the two by hypnotic treatment, athird personality appeared and told him that if he persisted, the twopersonalities would be withdrawn and the girl would die. Long believes that thisthird personality was the girl’s ‘higher self’, and that this was a case of‘possession’. The girl, said this other personality, should be left as she was,with two spirits sharing the body.Long had me convinced that many so-called ‘paranormal powers’ – likeprecognitions, premonitions and ‘second sight’ – are not ‘powers’ in thestrictest sense, but often due to spirits. Even ‘spirit possession’ could beliterally what it claimed to be, and not, as Aldous Huxley suggested, meresexual hysteria. If Long was correct – as Guy believed he was – then perhaps the‘Devils of Loudun’ was really a case of demoniacal possession. Even WilliamJames, a psychologist I admired enormously, finally came to believe something ofthe sort.And so, as I wrote Poltergeist, A Study in Destructive Haunting, I found myselfbeing dragged deeper and deeper into a world that I was unwilling to accept, yetwhich I found impossible to reject."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20> CRIMINAL HISTORYAlthough I had learned to abort the panic attacks, to ‘stop the milk fromboiling over’, so to speak – I still experienced ominous twinges of ‘the sinkingfeeling’ if I pushed myself too hard. This happened again in 1981, while I waswriting Poltergeist.While I was researching the book in February, my agent rang me to say thatReader’s Digest had offered $18,000 (about £7,000) for a short novel aboutRasputin. And the same day, a small press had offered £3,000 for a text aboutwitchcraft, to accompany a book of illustrations by the artist Una Woodruff.Since we had a £2,000 overdraft, this prospect of £10,000 was very attractive.The only problem was that I had agreed to deliver Poltergeist by the end ofJune, and they wanted 110,000 words. That meant writing a total of 220,000 wordsin less than five months. If my publisher could be persuaded to give me an extramonth to deliver Poltergeist, it would greatly ease the pressure. So I asked myagent to see if New English Library would agree to let me deliver at the end ofJuly.The answer was no; their tight schedule meant they had planned to have it inproof by mid-August.The morning this reply came, I went to see my doctor to have my blood pressurechecked, and he told me it was far too high – about 155 over 115 – and thatunless I got it down, I would be in danger of a stroke or heart attack. Headvised me to lose at least twenty pounds.I came back home feeling thoroughly gloomy, and went to my basement to settledown to the witchcraft book. I was writing an appalling account of the tortureof medieval witches – pouring gallons of water down their throats with a funneland burning them with hot irons – which depressed me further. And at a certainpoint I had to consult a book that I thought was somewhere in my basementworkroom. It was not, and I was inclined to give up the search; but I forcedmyself to go and look in a bookshed outside. And there my depression became sooverpowering that I began to fear that I was on the edge of total innercollapse. Was there a point, I wondered, when all my nervous energies woulddrain away and I would plunge into a kind of insanity? I felt as if I wassinking into a swamp of black mud.I had still not found the book, and sheer refusal to give in made me go and lookin a book case in the hall. There I finally found it, and I went back to mydesk, sunk in depression but still determined not to give way.As I sat down, a pencil rolled on to the floor, and I forced myself to bend downto pick it up. And as I did so, the depression suddenly popped like a bubble andvanished. It was as if some negative entity had been trying to drive me intosurrender, and when I refused, suddenly decided to release its stranglehold.The relief was enormous; I felt like a general who has won a battle.And so I ground on day after day, finishing the witchcraft book in a month, thengoing on to the Rasputin novel, and starting Poltergeist in mid-May. By thistime, the publishers had told me that if I could deliver all but the lastchapter by the end of June – so an editor could begin work on it – I could haveanother two weeks to write the final chapter. I finished the book with a day tospare.While I was finishing Poltergeist I had a piece of good news. Two years earlier,The Space Vampires had been optioned by a film company called Cannon; now welearned that they had decided to go ahead and make it. They paid us $13,000, thelargest sum we had received to date. We used £3,500 of this to pay off themortgage on our house, and experienced a marvellous sense of relief. Now finallywe had some security to offer the bank manager against the overdraft.Looking back on that depression-attack in the bookshed had made me aware ofsomething of which I had been only half-conscious: a recurring pattern in mylife that I needed to face. It looked as if ‘the angel that presided at mybirth’ had decided that the way to get the best out of me was to keep meconstantly struggling. The problem with human beings is that success causes themto become mechanical; it seemed that my fate involved being driven to furthereffort by a demonic overseer.My teens had been an endless struggle against discouragement, reaching a lowpoint when I decided to commit suicide. During the worst period, I hadmaintained a basic optimism by telling myself that things were bound to improve– and so they did. But the success of The Outsider demanded a completelydifferent kind of self-discipline: to maintain a sense of focused purpose inspite of pleasant distractions. My reaction was to escape the distractions andmove to Cornwall. The violent criticism of my second book brought a new problem:how to keep on making a living as a writer with a reputation that seemed damagedbeyond repair. And this problem refused to go away for the next twenty years. Ihad been forced to write book after book, and live off the advances. I sometimesfelt like someone bailing out a leaking boat with a teacup.The success of The Occult brought temporary relief – and then a new kind ofproblem when overwork induced the panic attacks of 1973. There could be noquestion of giving in to them and having a nervous breakdown: I had a family tosupport. So I had to deal with the problem through learning psychologicalself-control.I came to see that, in a sense, the attacks were my own fault. When I amworking, I tend to hurl myself at the task with a kind of impatience – thisexplains how I could write a book like The Occult in less than six months. Butif I am interrupted during that frantic flow of activity, I become frustratedand impatient, and feel that the task ‘isn’t worth the effort’. The result is aloss of inner pressure, like letting down a tyre.This is the feeling that Auden meant when he wrote: > Put the car away; when life fails,> What’s the good of going to Wales?It is an extremely dangerous state, for if it persists for any length of time,it makes all life seem pointless and futile. And once our inner pressure hasbeen reduced too much, it is extremely difficult to raise it back to normal.Faced with demands that seem excessive, we sink into a state that is akin todeep boredom. Suddenly, everything in life becomes too much for us. And it isthen we experience panic, as if about to be drowned in a stormy sea.My panic attacks taught me to cut off that ‘sinking feeling’ before it drainedaway all my energies. But that was only part of the solution. The next part wasto recover a sense of enthusiasm and purpose. The simplest way of doing this isto contemplate some imaginary disaster – Graham Greene chose an even morestraightforward method by playing Russian roulette.In theory, it should be possible for human beings to reach any level ofhappiness or intensity they choose, by using ‘the mind itelf’ and recognisinghow many awful things haven’t happened. The first person to learn to do thiseasily and naturally will have achieved the basic aim of our human evolution.Now I could see that what was being demanded of me was that I should learn tokeep on coping with these complexities. I just had to get good at it, and notallow myself to experience that sinking of the heart.I quickly discovered that when I did this, things tended to go right. When Ididn’t, they tended to go wrong.One of the signs that they were going right was synchronicities. When that bookfell off the shelf during the writing of The Occult, open at the right page, Ihad just forced myself to overcome my laziness and get out of my chair. It wasas if some invisible force was trying to teach me something.One of the most unaccountable examples of this occurred when Joy and I weredriving back from the pub one evening. (We often go to a local pub on Saturdayfor a glass of wine and a sandwich, but leave early, before it becomes crowded.)I remarked to Joy that one of the basic human problems is that we take thingstoo much for granted. For example, we took it completely for granted that thiscar would get us home …As I spoke, the car began to slow down, then stopped. I was baffled. The fuelgauge showed it was almost full. I pulled out the choke and turned the key. Itstarted for a moment, then cut out again.There was little traffic on the road, but when a car approached, I waved itdown, and asked the driver if he could give my wife a lift to Gorran Haven. Andwithin a quarter of an hour, Joy was back, driving the Land-Rover. I attached atow rope, and within ten minutes we were home.At the local garage, the proprietor told us that the engine had developed a rarefault he had never seen before.When I remembered the way the car had slowed down, then stopped, just as I wascommenting that we took it for granted that it would get us home, I had afeeling that it was as if something was trying to tell me something. Like thebook falling off the shelf, it was saying: yes, you’re right – life isn’t amatter of pure chance. And the lesson was not driven home too painfully; whathad happened was only a slight inconvenience, and we were not more than half anhour late getting home. I took heed of the message. Two weeks after finishing Poltergeist, we set out for Finland, where I was togive a series of seminars. It was there that I made some interesting newdiscoveries about the powers of the right brain.We drove up to Heathrow to take a plane to Helsinki. From there we were headedfor a remote settlement in the forest called Viitakivi. The thought of escapingto Finland after writing three books in four months was agreeable; for me thevery name conjured up lakes and pine forests and the music of Sibelius.The bearded man who met us off the plane had a slight American accent, andintroduced himself as Brad Absetz. And as we sat in an old-fashioned tea shopthat looked as though it was unchanged since the days of Ibsen and Strindberg,Brad told us about Viitakivi. It sounded rather like Esalen, in California, andwas subsidised by the Finnish government. The subjects taught there ranged fromworld religions to organic farming.On the train to Hameenlinna, I asked Brad if he did any writing – the kind ofpolite question one asks a travelling companion just to make conversation. Hisanswer: ‘A little poetry’, was also what one expects of a travelling companion –except that he added: ‘If you could say I wrote them.’Oddly enough, I understood immediately what he meant, and made a mental note toask him more later; at present, with the children asking what was the Finnishfor crisps and lemonade, this was no time to open a conversation aboutsplit-brain physiology.The next day Brad dropped in a sheaf of his poems to our cabin, which overlookedan immense lake. I found them remarkable – curiously nonliterary, and devoid ofany attempt to impress. Two hours later, as we sat together on the top step of asteaming sauna, I told him how much I liked them, and Brad began to tell me astory that was so fascinating that I knew immediately that I would have to writea book about it.In 1961, Brad and his wife had decided to adopt a new-born baby. But the childhad received very little love or attention since birth, and was now not onlyunresponsive, but screamed all the time.When the child was four and a half, he was found to have an abdominal cancer.Although they had four other children, Brad and his wife decided to give himtheir full attention, to try to make up for lost years. They took turns sittingup with him all night. And when the child died, eighteen months later, they wereshattered.Brad’s wife took it badly, and sank into depression. She would lie on the bedfor hours, plunged in a state of misery and guilt. Brad would lie beside her,ready to help during one of her rare excursions back to reality.He never slept, for he wanted to be there if she stirred. But gradually, helearned to sink into deep relaxation. And one day, he felt an impulse in hisright arm, as if it wanted to move. As he, in effect, gave it permission, thearm rose gently into the air. A few minutes later, the other arm did the same,while Brad looked on like a bystander.On subsequent occasions his legs did the same thing; his breathing patterns alsochanged. And one day as he stood in a queue in the dining room, his hand reachedout and took food he did not normally choose. When he allowed it to do thisregularly he began to feel healthier than he had ever felt in his life. Hisweight dropped by twenty pounds.Brad concluded that some ‘other self’, some part of his unconscious mind, wastrying to teach him something.One day when he came in from the first skiing of the year, his legs achingpainfully, the ‘other self’ made him lie on the bed, then caused his legs tomake a series of movements which quickly caused the discomfort to disappear.When his little daughter was making crayon drawings, she asked Brad to drawsomething. Again, ‘the other self’ took over and created a series of beautifulflower drawings, each one quite different – he did dozens. Finally came tworemarkable drawings which he labelled ‘The Fire Ball’ and ‘The Ice Crystal’,which seemed to have a quality of finality. After that, the drawings stopped.The poetry was written in the same way, his hand writing without effort. Butwhen, one day, his handwriting changed, and some ‘entity’ indicated that itwished to communicate, Brad said: ‘No, go away. This is for me’ – and it neverhappened again. Once more, at a certain point, the poetic impulse died away.The ‘other self’ even led Brad to become a bee keeper, and he did this withextraordinary success, producing excellent honey and never once being stung. Itwas as if the ‘other self’ entered into some perfect harmony with the bees.All this fascinated me. It was obvious that Brad had succeeded in establishingdirect communication with his right brain. And this is extremely rare. Ofcourse, all men of genius possess the power to communicate with the right brain– Mozart said that tunes just walked into his head, and all he had to do waswrite them down. A painter like Jackson Pollock obviously did much the samething. But most artists have to exercise far more left-brain control.In my own case, teaching myself to write had been a long and very discouragingprocess. In those early days, I would often spend an evening writing quickly andfluently, but when I read what I had written the next day, it made me groan withembarrassment. But I persisted, merely because I felt that becoming a writer wasmy only way of escape from dreary jobs. And one day I read what I had writtenthe evening before, and saw that this was what I had been trying to say. It wasobvious that the two persons inside my head were working together in perfectharmony, like two good tennis players, or two lumberjacks at either end of adouble-handled saw. Now I realised that these were my right and left brain, withthe right brain flinging up the insights, and the left turning them into wordsand writing them down.I began to see that the most important part of the secret was knowing that the‘other self’ is there, ready to help. Most people spend their lives in states ofunhappiness and tension because they believe, quite wrongly, that they are alone– just as I had during my panic attacks. And since I was still, to a minorextent, experiencing that uneasy sense of nervous tension while I was inFinland, I saw that Brad had something important to teach me.Which is why, on my return to England, I wrote a book called Access to InnerWorlds, and gave half the proceeds to Brad Absetz.I made another interesting discovery at Viitakivi. One of my students, amiddle-aged woman, told me she often felt depressed, and I addressed thissubject in class one morning.After speaking about Husserl, and explaining that all moods are ‘intentional’, Itold them to induce a mood of depression by thinking of the most depressingthings they could remember. Within about a minute, they were looking thoroughlygloomy. At this point I said: ‘OK – now un-depress yourselves.’They looked puzzled. I said: ‘Look, you’ve just depressed yourselvesdeliberately, so it must be possible to un-depress yourselves in the same way.’It took longer this time, but eventually they all looked cheerful again.In these exercises of mind control we also made use of the ‘pen trick’ –concentrating on it to induce a peak experience.One day, about half an hour before lunch, I decided to complicate the exerciseby introducing another factor: Reichian breathing. This had been taught to me bya pupil of Reich’s, Constance Rooth-Tracey. She told me to lie on my back, andbreathe in as deeply as possible, envisaging that I was breathing in vitalenergy – Reich’s orgone energy. Then, as I breathed out slowly, she told me torepeat: ‘Out – down – through’, as if forcing this energy down through my body.The ‘out’ is from the lungs, the ‘down’ the solar plexus, and the ‘through’ thegenitals and down to the feet. I discovered that Reichian breathing induces acurious glow of vitality.Now I told my students to combine the ‘pen trick’ with Reichian breathing: tofocus hard as they breathed in, then release the tension as they said: ‘Out,down, through.’I half-expected the pen trick and the Reichian breathing to cancel one anotherout. But on the contrary, they reinforced one another, and induced a deep senseof happiness and relaxation, which was almost like floating off the floor. As wewere lying there in this blissful state, I looked at my watch and realised thatlunch had started half an hour ago. As I recalled them to the present, we allstood up slowly, feeling that lunch was not nearly as interesting as what we hadbeen doing. Am I, then, suggesting that it is the right brain that communicates withspirits?That seems to me the logical conclusion: that when a medium goes into trance andspeaks with ‘spirit voices’, the ‘entities’ gain entrance through the rightbrain. The same, I think, must be true of tribal shamans. That other personinside us – what Maurice Maeterlinck called ‘the unknown guest’ – can holdconversations with beings who belong to another world.Oddly enough, at the time I wrote Access to Inner Worlds, I was far fromconvinced of life after death.During this period – the early 80s – a murder trial suggested that the problemof the split brain might have some interesting implications for criminology.This was the case of the Hillside Stranglers, who between October 1977 andFebruary 1978 had murdered and raped a dozen women in the Los Angeles area. Oneyear later, two students in Bellingham, Washington State, became the victims ofa sex murderer after they had been asked to do a ‘house sitting’ job by asecurity guard named Kenneth Bianchi, who insisted that he had no knowledgewhatever of the crimes. But since the evidence pointed clearly to Bianchi, hewas arrested and charged with the murders. It soon became clear that he mightalso be involved in the Los Angeles murders, together with his cousin AngeloBuono.Since Bianchi insisted that he had no memory of the murders, a psychiatristbegan to wonder if he might be a case of multiple personality, and asked him toallow himself to be hypnotised. Within minutes, Bianchi was speaking in astrange, low voice, and had introduced himself as ‘Steve’. Steve claimed to be apart of Bianchi who hated ‘Ken’, with whom he had to share the body; he was ahighly unpleasant character who spoke in a sneering voice and used a great dealof obscenity.Bianchi convinced several psychiatrists that he was a ‘multiple’. If he couldalso convince a judge, then Bianchi would be sentenced to a few years in amental hospital. And he would not be allowed to testify against his cousinAngelo.But Bianchi made a mistake, which proved he was only pretending to be a multiplepersonality. When, under hypnosis, he was told that his defence lawyer wassitting in an empty chair, he immediately jumped to his feet to shake hands. Thehypnotist had never seen this before – hypnotised subjects try not to touchtheir hallucinations.But Bianchi made an even greater mistake. Asked his surname, ‘Steve’ said it wasWalker. And the policeman in charge of the case had discovered that Bianchi hadstolen the identity papers of a psychology graduate named Steve Walker, and hadused them to get a false diploma. So Bianchi was revealed as a clever con man,and in due course, he and Buono were both sentenced to life for the Hillsidemurders.But although Bianchi proved to be a fake, at least one other criminal of theperiod, the rapist Billy Milligan, was generally accepted by the psychiatristswho examined him as having twenty-three sub-personalities, some of whom weremore talented than Billy was himself. And one of these, a central European,actually spoke languages that Billy could not speak. As I studied Daniel Keyes’sbook The Minds of Billy Milligan, I found myself more and more inclined toaccept that these were not ‘sub-personalities’, but other people – spirits.And so the subject of split-brain physiology, which I had written about inAccess to Inner Worlds and Frankenstein’s Castle, turned my mind once more inthe direction of crime and criminals. Which is why, thinking in terms of somelarge volume that could stand beside The Occult and Mysteries, I began to thinkabout writing a comprehensive history of crime and civilisation.Britain was in the midst of another of its economic crises, and it was reflectedin the publishing world. I had heard from fellow-writers that it was becomingharder and harder to get books commissioned. But I had been lucky. My publisherwas Granada, and my editor, Mark Barty-King, had become an old friend. It was toMark that I put the idea of writing a world history of crime, and was delightedwhen he commissioned it for an advance of £15,000.The book would have a basic unifying theme: the psychological motivation ofcriminality. And this was a subject on which I had received a vital clue from myfriend A. E. Van Vogt, after meeting him at the Hollywood Science FictionConvention in 1966.Van had made a truly amazing discovery about a type of person he labelled theRight Man – so called because his desire to save face is so great that he willnever, under any circumstances, admit he is in the wrong. If you prove to himthat he is wrong, he will hit you in the face rather than admit it. This is whyVan also labelled him the Violent Man.In 1956, in the course of planning a non-SF novel about a Chinese prison camp,Van noted the behaviour of the Right Man. His basic desire is to be a despotwith absolute power. But if the worst comes to the worst, he will make do bybehaving like a petty dictator with his wife and family. They have to behavewith slavish obedience, for the least questioning of his decisions leads to anexplosion of rage and physical violence.He may be flagrantly unfaithful to his wife, for sexual conquest is immenselyimportant to his self-esteem. But if his wife so much as smiles at another man,she may end with a black eye.He reserves this side of his character for his family; to other people, he oftenseems a normal, likeable man.The Right Man seems to have one strange characteristic. If his wife actuallyleaves him, he may have a nervous breakdown, or even commit suicide. She haskicked away the foundations of his sandcastle of illusion. Hitler, a typicalRight Man, came close to suicide when his niece – and mistress – Geli Raubalkilled herself to escape him. For when a Right Man has found a woman who issubmissive and admiring, it fills him with a new self-confidence and a sense ofhis own worth. He can then create his fantasy of power and greatness. If shewalks out on him, the whole structure threatens to collapse, together with hissanity. Van Vogt points out that it is necessary to feel a certain sympathy forthe Right Man because he is ‘struggling with an unbelievable inner horror’.Trapped in the carapace of an insatiable craving to be recognised and admired,he is like a man who is suffocating to death in a sealed room. Acts of violencecan bring temporary relief, but it only lasts for a few hours before thesuffocation starts again. This is precisely the same ‘horror’ that Conrad’s MrKurtz suffers from in Heart of Darkness.Right Men are incredibly common. When I talked about it in my classes inAmerica, many of the girls said: ‘My God, my father was like that,’ or, ‘That’sjust like my ex-husband.’What causes Right Man-ishness? Well, every member of the dominant 5 per centfeels the craving to express his dominance. But not all dominant males have‘what it takes’ to be successful. So, like a Romantic poet who needs to escapereality, they take refuge in imagination.But if you can find someone else to join you in your imaginative game, itbecomes ten times as satisfactory. That is why the submissive woman is soimportant to the Right Man. She is a guarantee that he is not a mere fantasist.Oddly enough, success makes no real difference to the Right Man. Once theobsession has taken a hold – early in life – it is almost impossible todislodge. Hitler and Stalin and Mao were all Right Men. So, as I discovered, wasthe actor Peter Sellers. The book by his son Michael, PS I Love You, revealsthat deep lack of inner self-assurance, and the selfish and violent behaviour,that mark the Right Man.The truth is that there can be few males who cannot, if they are honest,recognise traces of the Right Man in themselves. Provided he is aware of it andkeeps it under control, this hardly matters. It is the man who is unaware of itwho is a danger to himself and other people. And I quickly recognised that thisis the key to criminal psychology. The Right Man is like a spoilt child who isdetermined to get his own way. He is trapped in a world inside his own head. Andif he also lacks social conscience – or the caution that keeps most peopleinside the law – then he can behave appallingly and do society a great deal ofdamage.I had also noticed many cases in which the Right Man becomes truly dangerousonly after he has found a submissive woman to control. The obvious example wasIan Brady, the Moors Murderer, and his partner Myra Hindley. Brady, who had beenin Borstal for burglary, was not interested when the teenage Myra came to workin the same office, for she was obviously not a member of the samehigh-dominance group as Brady and, as Maslow discovered, high-dominance peopleprefer a partner in their own dominance group. But when he realised she wasinfatuated with him, he changed his mind. And once they were lovers, he foundthe sheer intoxication of being adored so addictive that it affected him like adrug. The Right Man suddenly had a partner to share his fantasy. And sinceBrady’s fantasies involved paedophilia, the ‘game’ played by the two of thembecame the abduction and murder of children.Myra herself, although not of the ‘dominant 5 per cent’, had some unpleasantcharacteristics due to the psychological insecurity of her upbringing. Thearrival of a sister, when Myra was four, meant that she spent much of herchildhood with her ‘gran’, who lived just around the corner. Myra grew up abully, who loved tormenting younger children. This is why she became the idealpartner for Brady. Like some starry-eyed convert to Nazism, she developed thementality of a concentration camp guard, and took to murder and torture withenthusiasm. She aided and abetted Brady in the kidnap, rape and murder of threechildren and two teenagers.As was almost inevitable, they were caught. Brady had tried to extend his sphereof influence to a young male admirer, the husband of Myra’s sister. But thesight of Brady murdering a teenage homosexual with a hatchet was too much forDavid Smith, and he went to the police.Brady still regards Smith with unremitting hatred, as I learned when I becameengaged in correspondence with him in 1991. A girl had asked me to help her withan autobiography in which her correspondence and friendship with Brady played acentral part. Brady wrote to ask me about the rumour that I was helping herwrite a book about him, and we began to exchange letters. I was impressed by hisintelligence and his wide reading, and jumped to the conclusion that a man asintelligent as this could be objective about his own crimes. It was soon obviousthat I was mistaken. For Brady was a Right Man, and nothing could persuade himthat he had been wrong to kill children. Like his favourite writer, de Sade, hebelieved that ‘everything is lawful’. It was society that was wrong, becausesociety was corrupt and rotten. It made no difference for me to point out thattwo wrongs do not make a right; he had persuaded himself that he was the victimof a vicious and immoral society.In due course he wrote a book called The Gates of Janus. I added an Introductionand found him a publisher. It is a remarkable document, for it is the only workin world literature in which a criminal Right Man argues his case that societyis really to blame for his crimes.The publication of the book – in 2001 – also marked the end of my correspondencewith Brady. His prison, Ashworth Hospital, demanded that some of his accusationsabout the way he was treated should be removed. They were finally contented witha brief erratum slip, without which the distributor refused to handle the book.But even this was too much for Brady, who exploded with rage because he felt thehospital had ‘won’. I was not too concerned when he ceased to correspond, for wehad, in fact, exhausted all we had to say to one another. But The Gates of Janusremains as a unique Right Man document, paranoid, obsessive and wrong-headed. Writing the book that became A Criminal History of Mankind was an importantexperience for me, for it was my first attempt to grapple with history. Thehistorian A. L. Rowse had remarked to me in the 1970s that I ought to learn moreabout history, but I had felt that the subject offers little opportunity for mykind of psychological analysis. Writing the Criminal History proved me wrong. Itsoon became apparent to me that every time human beings have tried to create asociety based on peace and cooperation, criminals have immediately used theirdominance to gain control.Rome itself is an example of a civilisation that was taken over by plunderersand gangsters. For my chapter on Rome, I borrowed the title ‘No Mean City’ froma novel about Glasgow gangsters – the original quotation is St Paul’s ‘I am acitizen of no mean city’, referring to Rome.It struck me as interesting that the original Christianity of Jesus should havebeen an attempt to create a genuinely non-criminal society, based on love andmutual aid, and that as soon as the emperor Constantine made Christianity theofficial state religion in AD 313, the Christian Church should have immediatelybecome another massively corrupt and criminal institution, based upon power andwealth.One day, when I had actually finished writing the book, and was rereading thetypescript, I was struck by the way that civilisation has steadily increased itspace, from its slow and gentle beginnings to its present headlong rush. Itstarted like a broad, slow river with the earliest humanoid apes. With ourancestor Homo erectus it seemed to enter a valley, and became a fast-flowingstream. With Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon man, it is as if the river has entered acanyon and become a torrent. With the building of cities, the raft that carriesmankind entered a narrow gorge full of dangerous rapids. And now man flies alongbetween towering walls, surrounded by drifting wreckage and bodies struggling inthe water, he is having to concentrate as never before.As I added a passage to the book in which I said this, I noticed the parallel tomy own position, and the steadily increasing pace at which I had been forced towork. The panic attacks had almost flung me among bodies struggling in thewater, but so far I had managed to cling on and continue to steer. If I meant tosurvive, I also had to concentrate as never before.The writing of the Criminal History brought two more important insights thatwere to play a central part in my subsequent work. The first was that all humansexuality is based on ‘the sexual delusion’. To recap, the effect of sexualattractiveness on human beings is very much like the effect of the Pied Piper onthe rat population of Hamelin, or of the song of the Sirens on Ulysses: itcreates an overwhelming feeling of desire that overpowers the senses like anintoxicant. This recognition – that sexual desire is literally a delusion –threw an entirely new light on the problem of sex crime.It also made me realise the extent of the part played by the sexual delusion inmy own development. Considering those powerful feelings that had made me pull onmy mother’s knickers long before I knew anything about sex made me aware that Ihad been dominated by the sexual illusion since I was born. In my teens itdivided me into two: the romantic who dreamed of some incarnation of the eternalfeminine, and the realist who read of the crimes of a rapist with muted envy.Like the hero of Hermann Hesse’s Steppenwolf, I was both a man and a wolf. Thehuman part was the part that loved Joy and the children, but the wolf continuedto growl and slaver in the background whenever a girl in a mini-skirt bent overand showed her nylon-clad behind.At least, as I grew older, the self-division had ceased to be quite so painful.I recognised the desire as a kind of drug addiction. I could count half a dozenfriends who had given way to it, and wrecked their marriages and their lives.But I am not sure whether I was becoming more moral, or just more cautious.The other realisation came when I was writing about the birth of the modernnovel in the eighteenth century. It was invented by a printer named SamuelRichardson, who had decided to tell a story in the form of letters. They arefrom a servant girl named Pamela, whose master, Squire B, is determined toseduce her. When she is undressing, he leaps out of a cupboard and throws her onthe bed. Only the entrance of the housekeeper saves her. Then he sends her to abrothel, and tries to rape her as the procuress holds her hands, but she goesinto convulsions and he gives up again. Finally, overcome by her sweetness andgoodness, he marries her.Nothing like this had ever appeared – a moral tale that read rather likepornography – and Pamela became a best-seller. Clergymen praised it from thepulpit. And soon novels were being read in every middle-class household. Lendinglibraries sprang up all over Europe.What Richardson had done was to invent a kind of magic carpet that wouldtransport readers to a land of dreams. So far, human beings had shared the fateof animals, and been tied down to mere physical existence. For most people, theonly escape from the dullness of everyday life was when they went to church onSunday and listened to the vicar telling them stories from the Bible. That waswhy the best-sellers of the time were volumes of sermons.By 1780 a bored housewife could curl up in a window seat and simply forget whoshe was. Instead, she spent the next hour or so in the world of the author’simagination, and shared the problems and dangers of the heroine. It was asstartling as if human beings had learned to leave their bodies and float aroundin space. There is a sense in which the novel was the most important inventionsince the wheel.I felt that this was one of the greatest insights I had ever had. Julian Huxleyhad said to me that I ought to give some thought to the vital role art hasplayed in human evolution. Now I understood what he meant. The novel taughthuman beings to dream. And of course, it also made them develop a taste foranother world – the world of mystery and beauty and romance. The romanticswanted to turn their backs on the ugliness of everyday life, and find a richerand more exciting reality. In the nineteenth century, this craving caused manytragedies, from the deaths of Keats and Shelley to the suicide of Van Gogh. Infact, this ‘eternal longing’ ushered in the age of ‘Outsiderism’, and of whatKarl Marx called alienation.It is significant that in Richardson’s even more popular second novel, Clarissa,the heroine is raped as well as abducted, and dies of shame. From then on,writers quickly discovered that sexual fantasy has a ready audience, and thegenre we call pornography was launched in 1745 with John Cleland’s Fanny Hill.By 1820, pornography was a flourishing industry – the production of what onewriter called ‘books that one reads with one hand’.Yet oddly enough, there was very little of what we would now call ‘sex crime’.One reason is certainly that among the poor, so many women were forced to selltheir bodies that cheap sex was generally available, and it would have beenpointless to risk jail for it. It was only in the second half of the century,when Victorian prudery had endowed sex with the allure of the forbidden, thatsex crime in our modern sense appeared. It struck the Victorians as so bizarrethat they did not even recognise the murders of Jack the Ripper as sex crimes –the favourite theory being that he was a ‘religious maniac’ with a hatred offallen women.In other words, sex crime came into its own in the nineteenth century, with thesudden increase in the ‘sexual delusion’. The pornographers who followed in thesteps of de Sade had invented what might be called ‘superheated sex’, and thiswould bring about a slow but complete transformation of human nature, until wefind ourselves living in the age of the serial killer.The writing of Criminal History was also important for me because it placed theideas of my ‘Outsider cycle’ in a historical context. Suddenly it was possiblefor me to see the direction of the stream of my work since The Outsider. I hadrecognised from the beginning that we are living in an ‘age of defeat’, and thatthis defeat is based on the disappointment of the hopes of the romantics. Goetheand Schiller thought that man has a godlike potential. H. G. Wells wrote a novelcalled Men Like Gods. In Back to Methuselah, Shaw forecast a time when humankindwill be virtually immortal. Yeats said that the aim of art is the ‘profaneperfection of mankind’. Yet all this had collapsed into the pessimism that isthe foundation of literature from Graham Greene to Beckett, and philosophy fromHeidegger to Derrida and the post-moderns.Yet Maslow had seen the basic solution: that the ‘peak experience’ is thedriving force of all creative individuals, and that this remains untouched bynegative thinking.The Criminal History was finished early in 1983, after an almost completerewrite. The sheer length of time it had taken meant that our finances were inthe usual crisis – we were £10,000 overdrawn.My bank manager asked me to go in and see him. He was a nice man – I hadoccasionally given after dinner speeches at his rotary club – but obviouslyworried about the situation. ‘The problem is that this loan is unsecured.’‘Unsecured?’ I was astonished. ‘But surely you have the deeds to our house?’ Heshook his head.Joy, it seemed, had simply forgotten to hand them over when we paid off themortgage. (A certain sweet vagueness was the price she paid for her serene,easygoing nature.)He asked me: ‘What kind of house do you have?’‘A fairly large bungalow standing in two acres of building land.’‘Oh, in that case, you can have what you like!’We agreed that a £15,000 overdraft would serve for the time being, and I drovehome in a state of euphoria.I needed the sense of financial security, for I had decided to bring my motherdown to live with us. Ever since the death of my father in 1975, she had beenliving alone in Leicester. Just before dad’s death she had suffered a stroke andcollapsed in the street – obviously due to the stress of nursing him. By thetime he died, she had recovered, and I was looking forward to bringing her toCornwall for long holidays, perhaps even taking her for trips abroad. But shesoon had another stroke that made her vague and absent-minded. Living inLeicester made her nervous – she read in the paper about the increase inburglary, and used to lie awake at night. I decided that bringing her toCornwall was the only solution.Joy was not entirely happy – what if my mother had another stroke and neededfull-time nursing? But we decided to take the risk, and in the spring of 1983 Idrove to Leicester to fetch her.Our anxieties proved unnecessary. She was the perfect guest, quiet andunobtrusive. I was delighted to have her living with us, for I think most malesare deeply protective about their mothers, and it gave me real satisfaction tosee her sitting on the settee opposite me and reading or dozing.Even her death was quiet and unobtrusive. One Saturday evening in October 1991,we took her to the pub as usual for an early drink. When we got home, we hadsupper, and watched a television programme about life after death, in which twowomen spoke of their absolute certainty of human survival. The next morning, mumfailed to make her usual appearance at about 10.30, but we assumed she hadoverslept. Finally, Joy went into the bedroom, and found her lying on the floor;she had died of a stroke as she dressed.Joy called me – I was writing an Introduction to an American edition of mypoltergeist book – and I went into the bedroom, where she was lying on thecarpet. I suddenly felt deeply sorry that I had never shown her how much I lovedher. Our family is emotionally reserved, and although I show endless affectionto my wife and children, some working-class inhibition had always made it hardto show it to my mother. I recalled that, only a week before, as I brought her acup of tea, she had said: ‘Oh, I do love you, m’duck’, and now I regretted notpushing aside the inhibition and replying: ‘And I love you.’ Instead, I hadsmiled awkwardly and gone out.Now I tried to make up for it by kneeling beside her, kissing her soft coldcheek, and saying: ‘I love you mum.’ I hoped she was somewhere nearby, to hearme say it. Then I lifted her on to the bed – she was very light – and as I didso she sighed, and I thought she might not be dead after all. But it was onlythe air coming out of her lungs.I wish I had told her I loved her while she was alive. Back in the practical world, the next problem now was to think up a subject formy next book.At that point, I remembered something I had overlooked in The Occult andMysteries: psychometry. This is the curious ability that some people possess tohold an object in their hands and ‘read’ its history.They may not even realise they possess this power. In 1921, a group of peoplemet in Paris to test a clairvoyant. Among them was a novelist named PascalForthuny, who was a total sceptic. And as someone was passing a letter to theclairvoyant, Forthuny grabbed it and said: ‘It can’t be difficult to inventsomething that applies to anybody.’ He held it against his forehead. ‘Ah yes, Isee a crime … a murder.’ And when he had finished his improvisation, the ownerof the letter said: ‘That was written by Landru, at present on trial for killinga dozen women.’Forthuny then held other objects, and was able to describe their history withamazing accuracy. He had not dreamed he possessed the power of psychometry.The word was invented around 1840 by a young American professor of medicinenamed Joseph Rodes Buchanan. He happened to be talking to a bishop namedLeonidas Polk, who mentioned that he could detect brass, even in the dark,because it produced an offensive metallic taste in his mouth when he held it inhis hand.Buchanan decided to test it out on his students, and discovered that a number ofthem could not only detect brass, but various other metals like iron and copper,and some could even distinguish sugar, salt, pepper and vinegar.Buchanan concluded that our fingers must have the same ability as our tongues todistinguish tastes. He felt he had made an interesting scientific discovery.His next step was just as exciting. He handed one of his ‘sensitives’ varioussealed envelopes containing letters written by people of strong character. The‘sensitive’ was able to describe the character of the letter writers withremarkable accuracy.Buchanan still felt that all this could be explained scientifically. Photographyhad only recently been discovered. And a photograph is, after all, only a kindof painting made by light on the sensitive chemicals of a photographic plate. Soif a person happens to be ‘sensitive’, why should he not be able to register theeffect of a strong personality, like a photographic plate?The next step was slightly more controversial. Buchanan put photographs insealed envelopes and handed them to his sensitives. Once more, the results wereimpressively accurate. But how could that be, since photography is a purelymechanical process? Then the answer occurred to him. Most people would havehandled their own photographs, leaving the imprint of their personality, whichwould then be picked up by the ‘nerve aura’ of the sensitive.This theory was disproved when he tried using newspaper photographs, and hissensitives were just as successful in identifying them. How could a newspaperphotograph carry the imprint of the sitter’s personality?The only possible answer was that human beings possess powers of perception thatare far greater than they suppose. And in 1848, Buchanan chose a name for this‘new faculty’; he called it ‘psychometry’, meaning ‘mind measurement’.Buchanan’s discovery should have made him famous among his medical colleagues,for it had been established by a careful series of scientific experiments.Unfortunately, he was about to be overtaken by a wholly unforeseen disaster.In that year, the home of the Fox family, in New York state, was shaken by aseries of baffling disturbances – bangs and crashes that made the house tremble.We would now call these poltergeist phenomena. Neighbours who establishedcommunication with this entity – by means of a code of raps – were told that itwas a peddlar who had been murdered and buried in the cellar by a previousowner. The publicity spread nationwide, and soon dozens of ‘mediums’ (as theyhad become known) were holding seances in darkened rooms and apparently talkingto ghosts. In 1849, the first ‘spiritualist’ association was set up inRochester, N.Y. As the craze swept around the world, scientists became furiousat what seemed to them a return to the superstition of the Dark Ages.Understandably, Buchanan found himself tarred with the same brush. This is why‘psychometry’ failed to achieve the acclaim it deserved.But Buchanan had at least one disciple. Nine years Buchanan’s junior, his namewas William Denton, and he was the Professor of Geology at the University ofBoston. He came upon one of Buchanan’s original papers on psychometry, and wasfascinated by a paragraph that suggested that a psychometrist ought to be ableto hold a piece of a dinosaur fossil, and see the dinosaur ‘rise before hiseyes’.His sister Anne seemed to be a highly sensitive person, so he began by handingher sealed letters written by people with strong personalities. Impressed by heraccuracy, he tried her with a piece of limestone full of tiny fossil shells, andwrapped in paper. Her reaction was ‘Oh, what shells, small shells: so many …’And she described the place on the Missouri River it came from.He tried handing her a fragment of volcanic lava from Kilauea, in Hawaii,concealed in paper. She saw ‘an ocean of fire pouring over a precipice’ andmaking the sea boil. She also saw ships on the sea; and the lava had beenejected in the eruption of 1840, when the US Navy was in the bay.He tried a fragment of bone on his wife; she saw a creature with a thick skin,and a horned head rather like that of a sheep. What she seems to have describedwas a plesiosaur, the species to which the Loch Ness monster is supposed tobelong.A fossil from Cuba brought a description of a tropical island. A piece of Indianpottery brought an image of Red Indians. A piece of meteorite brought visions ofempty space. A pebble from a glacier produced an impression of being frozen at agreat depth. A piece of rock from Niagara brought the sound of a torrent, andlooking into a deep hole with something boiling up in it – the psychometristguessed a hot spring.And so they went on – visions that seemed to indicate that psychometry was akind of telescope into the past.To make sure she was not reading his mind, Denton mixed up specimens in parcelsuntil he no longer knew what was what. The visions were still accurate. And oneexperiment seemed to prove conclusively that this was not telepathy. Dentonhanded his wife a piece of mosaic pavement from the villa of the Roman oratorCicero, hoping for a description of Cicero. She ‘saw’ helmeted soldiers in avilla, and a fleshy man with blue eyes who was obviously not Cicero (who wastall and thin). Denton only found out later that the the emperor Sulla had alsolived in the villa, and fitted the description exactly.These experiments seemed to show beyond doubt that Buchanan’s ‘psychometry’ wasa genuine human faculty that no one had suspected – one more curious power ofthe right brain. Yet because it seemed to smack of spiritualism, it failed toattract the attention of scientists.There was, of course, another problem. If psychometry worked even with newspaperphotographs, it could not be a ‘natural’ faculty like the bloodhound’s sense ofsmell. Which meant that scientists like Buchanan and Denton found themselvesbeing dragged, much against their will, down the slippery slope of ‘occultism’ –precisely as I had been myself. Once you admitted the possibility of someanomaly like psychometry, dowsing or multiple personality, it was impossible, ifyou were honest, not to find yourself compelled to admit the possibility of agreat deal more. (I have known only one scientist who managed to pull himselfback from the brink – Professor John Taylor, a physicist who studied Uri Gellerand dowsing, then suddenly reaffirmed his total scepticism and rejoined the foldof the respectable.)In deciding to write a book about psychometry, I was trying to revive a‘science’ that had been forgotten for more than half a century. The problem, ofcourse, was what such a book should be called. Telescope into the Past wouldhave been ideal, but would have failed to interest most readers – and thepaperback publisher Pan Books, who commissioned it, wanted a ‘selling title’.So, not for the first time, I had to compromise, and accept The PsychicDetectives. In June 1985, the film of The Space Vampires, now retitled Lifeforce, finallyreached the screen.It had been directed by Tobe Hooper, an associate of Stephen Spielberg, and somevast sum – running to millions of dollars – had been spent on ‘special effects’.When Joy and I heard that it was being filmed on the same set as Star Wars, weallowed ourselves to daydream of a whole series of my novels being optioned byHollywood, and the end of living off an overdraft.A few days after its New York premiere, we heard that it had been a flop. When Ifinally saw it – at a special screening for myself and my family in Plymouth – Iunderstood why.Whatever the merits of The Space Vampires as serious literature, it is a goodstory, and moves on logically, step by step, from the initial discovery of thevampires in the wrecked spacecraft, to the problem of how the pursuers couldtrack down and corner aliens who can transfer themselves from body to body. Inthat sense it has the structure of a detective story.The trouble with the film was that it tried to move too fast. If I had beengiven a chance to work on the script, I would have drawn a lesson from theoriginal King Kong, with its long, slow build-up of suspense, which is suddenlyreleased as the giant ape rampages out of the jungle. In Lifeforce, from themoment the vampires kill the guards and walk out into modern London, the paceaccelerates until it is like a gramophone record being played at twice itsproper speed. And the audience, bombarded and stunned by absurd special effects,soon lapses into a state of exhausted indifference.John Fowles had once told me that the film of The Magus was the worst movie evermade. After seeing Lifeforce I sent him a postcard telling him that I had goneone better."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21> DREAMING TO SOME PURPOSEIn July 1986, Joy came down to my work room to say that a Japanese friend was onthe phone, asking if we would like to fly to Tokyo, and go on a tour of Buddhistmonasteries. Joy was included in the invitation, and they were offering to payall travel expenses – first class – and a fee of several thousand dollars.Naturally, I accepted.Ever since The Outsider was published in Tokyo in 1957, the Japanese had beenenthusiastic about my work, and translated virtually everything – even magazinearticles. One delightful day in 1976, when I had just staggered home exhaustedfrom making a television programme in Bristol, Joy had said: ‘You’re not goingto believe this,’ and held out a cheque for £10,000. My Japanese publisher wasbringing out a new edition of The Occult, and this was payment in advance. Themoney came just in time for a holiday we had booked in France, and for the nexttwo weeks we stayed in the best hotels, ate the best food and drank the bestwine. Understandably, I felt considerable affection for the Japanese.In mid-1986 I was in need of a long holiday. Since finishing The PsychicDetectives, I had written a novel called The Personality Surgeon, a shortbiography of Rudolf Steiner, and a study of the evidence for life after deathcalled Afterlife. And at the time of the phone call from Tokyo, I had recentlyfinished a fantasy novel called Spider World.This had come about through my meeting with a neighbour called Donald Seaman, aretired foreign correspondent from the Daily Express. When the spies Guy Burgessand Donald Maclean had defected to Moscow in 1951, Don had been asked to coverthe case, and had ended by writing a book about it. And since the spy novels ofJohn Le Carré and Len Deighton had become so popular, Don had decided to applyhis knowledge of espionage to writing a thriller. The result was The Bomb ThatCould Lip Read, which sold a respectable number of copies and established hisname as a spy novelist. So when he was offered early retirement and a ‘goldenhandshake’, Don decided to move to Cornwall and supplement his income by writinga thriller every year.He and his wife Irene found themselves a beautiful little cottage in a hamletcalled Penare; a wishing well in the garden made it look like a set from a WaltDisney film. Unfortunately, the cottage was owned by the National Trust, and Donspent most of his golden handshake renting it on a long lease. His next four spynovels were reasonably successful, but by the time I met him in 1983, he wasalready beginning to experience the difficulties of most authors who try to liveby writing alone.Don and I used to walk our dogs on the cliffs between Gorran Haven and Penareevery afternoon, and discuss our work and current problems. His were mainlyfinancial, and one day, when he was in urgent need of money to pay the rates, Isuggested that we might collaborate on a sequel to the Encyclopedia of Murder Ihad written with Pat Pitman in 1960. The same publisher – Weidenfeld – acceptedit, and the advance enabled Don to clear his debts.Don had travelled all over the world as a foreign correspondent, and had someamazing stories. I often suggested that he should, like Negley Farson, write hisautobiography. But the truth was that Don lacked Negley’s drive and charisma.His idea of heaven was simply to walk on the Dodman – the peninsula betweenGorran Haven and Penare – twice a day, and relax with a glass of whisky in theevening.After An Encyclopedia of Modern Murder, Don suggested that we might write anencyclopedia of scandal. The idea struck me as too journalistic, but the more Ithought about it, the more interesting it seemed – after all, there were somemarvellous historical scandals, like the South Sea Bubble and the Dreyfus affairand Queen Caroline’s adulteries; so we got the book commissioned, and once againDon was able to pay his rates and tax bill. The only problem was that he was afar slower writer than I was, so I ended by writing two thirds of both books.Bored with writing spy thrillers, Don decided to transfer his scene to the latenineteenth century, and write about a plot by the IRA to assassinate QueenVictoria. His agent was enthusiastic, and assured him that the book – calledChase Royal – would transform his lifestyle. It did – but in the wrongdirection, and poor sales made his financial problems worse than ever. Isometimes had to lend him the money to avert severe crises – to Joy’s disgust,since our overdraft was far larger than Don’s. But we had collateral, since weowned our house, and Don hadn’t.He toyed with the idea of writing a science fiction novel, about anuclear-powered spacecraft that crashes into a Canadian lake and causesnightmarish mutations, but his heart was not in it. One evening, after watchinga television programme about insect defence, I had a flash of inspiration. Andthe next day I said: ‘I think I’ve got it. A novel called Spider World, about afuture date in which the earth is taken over by giant telepathic spiders, whobreed human beings for food.’ But Don wrinkled his nose. ‘It doesn’t sound mycup of tea.’ But by now I had become enthusiastic about the idea. ‘Then whydon’t we write it together? I’ll get my publisher to commission it, and give youthe first part of the advance.’My publisher accepted the idea, and paid us £5,000, half the advance, which Igave to Don. We agreed that we would write alternate chapters, and that I wouldwrite the first. I began Spider World at the end of March 1985.I set the first scene in an underground burrow in the desert, where a smallfamily of human beings, including the seventeen-year-old hero, Niall, hide fromthe spider balloons that patrol overhead. The spiders are telepathic, and canpick up the thought-vibrations of humans. And for some unknown reason, theyregard humans with a virulent hatred, and are determined that none shall remainfree. As their thought-beams scan the desert like radar, the humans have tolearn to restrain their panic, which would give them away immediately …As I wrote, I found myself becoming increasingly absorbed. I had done a greatdeal of research on deserts and their inhabitants, such as tiger beetles andtrapdoor spiders – which hide underground and leap out on their prey – so therewas no shortage of interesting, and often rather gruesome, material. And as Iwrote I experienced a sensation like an aeroplane taking off. I had never feltso completely gripped by anything I had written.Every other day Don would ask me: ‘Would you like me to start writing my bityet?’ and I would answer: ‘No, let me do a few more pages …’ Then one day, Donsaid: ‘Look, you’re obviously enjoying this so much that I don’t want tointerrupt you. Why don’t you go ahead and do the whole book?’ I agreed that hecould keep the advance we had received, and I told my publisher that SpiderWorld had ceased to be a collaboration, and would appear under my name only.The main problem was that the book was going to be far longer than I hadintended. It was supposed to be a hundred thousand words – about 250 pages. Butby the time I had reached a hundred thousand words, it was obvious that I wasnot even halfway through. Niall’s family have been captured by the spiders, andtaken to the spider city, where they are enslaved. Niall escapes, and makes hisway to a strange white tower in the centre of the city, which proves to be akind of time capsule, left by an earlier race of human beings before theyabandoned earth to escape the impact of a giant comet. And as Niall learns abouthis forebears, he begins to grasp the possibility of restoring the human race tofreedom … And at that point there was still a long way to go. The book was notfinished until the end of February 1986, exactly eleven months after it had beenstarted.My publisher was impressed with it, but said that it was obviously too long – aquarter of a million words. The solution was to publish it in two volumes. And,to my delight, Grafton also agreed to double the advance. We used this to pay atax bill of £5,400.By the time we received the invitation from Tokyo, I had already started my nextbook, an Encyclopedia of Unsolved Mysteries. This had been commissioned byHarrap (who had already published an anthology of my work called The EssentialColin Wilson) and they paid an advance of £10,000, half on signature. This Idecided to write in collaboration with my son Damon, who was now twenty-one, andhad still not quite decided what he intended to do with his life. I felt thatcollaborating with me would be the easiest way of teaching him to write.‘Teaching him to write’ sounds more laborious than it was; in fact, my mainpiece of advice was simply to go through every sentence and strike out eachunnecessary word.It cost me a struggle with my conscience not to ask Don to collaborate, for Iknew he needed the money. But his financial problems were unending, and I had myown family to think about.When Don’s bank manager wrote to him forbidding him to write any more cheques, Ihad to rescue him again, to Joy’s indignation; but I felt I owed him a debt forallowing me to take over Spider World.Joy and I set out for Japan in late October 1986; by that time, Damon and I hadcompleted the Encyclopedia of Unsolved Mysteries, and he was already writinglike a professional.The friend who had arranged our trip was an interpreter named Kazue Kobata. Ihad met her when she came to interview me for Japanese Playboy. Our hosts therewere to be the monks of Koyasan, one of Japan’s greatest Buddhist monasteries,which was celebrating its thousandth anniversary. It had been founded by a monknamed Kobo daishi or Kukai, whose sect was known as Shingon (or Esoteric)Buddhism.Although I had been deeply influenced by Buddhism in my teens, my attitudetowards it had become slowly less wholehearted. It seemed to me that compared toHinduism, whose aim is union with God (or Brahman), Buddhism seems basicallynegative. The legend tells how the parents of Prince Gautama decided that heshould be protected from all knowledge of evil, and so kept him in their palace.But one day the boy was out with his tutor when they saw a sick man. The princeasked, ‘What is wrong with him?’ and the tutor replied, ‘He is sick – it issomething that happens to everyone.’ The next day they saw a very old man, andagain the prince asked, ‘What is wrong with him?’ and the tutor replied, ‘He isold – it happens to everyone.’ Finally they saw a dead man’s funeral procession.Again, the prince asked, ‘What is wrong with him?’ and was told: ‘He is dead –it happens to everyone.’ And Gautama was so shocked that he began to wonder howhuman beings could escape misery and death.His answer was the eightfold path, which involves a high level of religiousself-discipline. This enables men to achieve complete detachment from theirdesires, and to attain the state of nirvana, union with the absolute.Yet it had always seemed to me that the aim of self-discipline is notdetachment: it is an attempt to understand the unknown potentialities of humanconsciousness – those amazing potentialities of which I had become aware throughthe study of subjects like psychometry, precognition and out-of-the-bodyexperience. Yeats, I felt, was right: the aim is ‘profane perfection ofmankind’.Now shortly before we set out, I had read a book about Kobo daishi, the founderof Esoteric Buddhism, which had been sent to me by my future hosts, and had beendelighted to see that one of his main teachings is ‘enlightenment in this verylife’. This, surely, described my own aim. Which is why, when we caught ourflight from Heathrow, I felt much happier about what lay ahead of me.Our plane took off at 2.45 in the afternoon, and we halted in Anchorage, Alaska,at 3 pm local time. It seemed strange to be in blazing sunlight when my bodyknew it was midnight. It was even stranger to have dinner on the plane at 2o’clock in the morning, and stranger still to arrive in Tokyo at 8.30 in themorning London time and discover that it was 4.30 in the afternoon. I feltcompletely disoriented. We then caught a flight to Osaka – the nearest city tothe monastery of Koyasan – arriving at 7 o’clock in the evening, although mybody knew it was only 11 in the morning.Two hours later, we sat down to dinner with the Reverend Matsunaga, the rectorof Koyasan University, another monk, a representative of Mainichi newspaper,which was sponsoring our trip, and our friend and interpreter Kazue. TheJapanese dinner consisted of courses of raw fish, sea weed, turtle soup andrice, washed down with saké. That night I slept very badly, largely because mybody could not understand why I had gone to bed at three in the afternoon. (Ishould have asked my doctor for sleeping tablets – it would have saved me agreat deal of maladjustment.)After a press conference at which I was dopey with fatigue, we were given lunchand taken to look at Osaka, after which we caught a train to Koyasan. Themonastery lies ten miles up a mountain, and on the cable car, which climbed at45 degrees through lovely autumn woods, I disregarded Kazue’s advice and fellasleep, a mistake that would cost me another night’s sleep.It was cold at Koyasan, so that after our vegetarian dinner we retired to theReverend Matsunaga’s room, where we sat around a table covered with a thickcloth that reached the floor, and a hot stove under the table close to ourknees. The monks had a taste for scotch whisky, which they drank in surprisingquantities. I, being a wine drinker, avoided it and stuck to saké. After that, Itook a bath in a huge stone tub, with water about four feet deep. A youngJapanese professor named Hirose Yoshiji (who asked me to call him Hiro) joinedme in the steaming water, and startled me by remarking: ‘Ah, Mr Wilson, inEngland you must be as famous as Charles Dickens!’ He was too young for me tosuspect him of sarcasm, and when I replied: ‘In England, few people have heardof me,’ he looked astonished.That night I slept on a mat in a small room in a temple, and after two hourssleep lay awake for the rest of the night. The result was that when I dressed inthe morning I felt not only exhausted but also hung over.An ‘English breakfast’ consisting of two cold fried eggs on toast did nothing toimprove it. After that we were taken on a tour of the temple complex, which wasvast. In a kind of cemetery, consisting of elaborate tombs, I felt like nothingso much as lying down on one of them and falling asleep. (Joy, who had beensensible enough to keep herself awake on the train, was wide awake and full ofcuriosity.) A point came where I realised that I had to make a real mentaleffort to throw off this fatigue. So I concentrated very hard, and did the ‘StNeot Margin trick’ – awakening myself to a sense of crisis. To my relief, itworked, and I suddenly began to feel less like a zombie. The Master Kobo daishiwas obviously right – the answer lay in the mind itself.Nevertheless, it was a relief to catch a cable car back to Osaka around midday,then take the ‘bullet train’ – which travels at 120 miles an hour – to Tokyo.Mount Fuji looked unbelievably beautiful as we passed. We were in Tokyo by six,and took a taxi past the Emperor’s palace (Hirohito was still alive), andarrived at the magnificent Akasaka Prince Hotel, where we had a suite thatoverlooked the whole of Tokyo. There Kazue presented us with our air tickets toAustralia, the next leg of our journey (for which our generous hosts had alsopaid), and a further million yen (more than £4,000) as my fee for coming toJapan, as well as ‘pocket money’ of about £50 a day (each) for lunch and dinner.(In 1986, Japan was at the height of its economic boom and the sense of wealthwas awe-inspiring.)I was worried in case I was still suffering from jet-lag when I had to delivermy first lecture at midday the next day. But all went well: I got a good night’ssleep, and woke at nine the next morning, feeling greatly refreshed, and ate anEnglish breakfast of bacon, egg and tomato. My guardian angel was back on thejob again.Lecturing to a vast audience who were all listening through earphones was anunsettling experience, for I had to speak slowly so Kazue could translate. Theresult was that there was no ‘response’ from the audience. But I was used totalking into a tape recorder – I had been keeping my diary on cassette for thepast three years – so it came easily. But it was good to hear later that mylecture had been received with enthusiasm.That afternoon, after a late lunch of sushi (eaten out of a square wooden boxwith a sliding lid), we were taken on a shopping expedition to the Ginza, thenback to the hotel to attend a symposium on mandalas. I was by now so tired thatI wanted nothing except to go to my room and rest. I knew I was due to attend areception in the evening, but since most receptions consist of standing aroundholding a glass and accepting canapés from trays I felt I would hardly bemissed.I was just drinking a glass of French wine that I had been able to buy at areasonable price in the Ginza when the phone rang. It was Kazue asking where wewere. So we hurried down – and discovered that everyone was waiting for us toarrive. When we appeared, they clapped, then we had to walk between two lines ofapplauding guests to our place at the table. I had not been so surprised since1973, when I arrived in Beirut to find the mayor and corporation waiting for us.It took me some time to realise that in Japan I was as well known as I had beenin the Middle East, and that Hiro had been perfectly serious in assuming I wasas famous as Charles Dickens. When I appeared at a large bookstore, the queuefor my lecture stretched around the block, and many had to be turned away.Another charming Japanese custom was to hand me an envelope after pressinterviews or broadcasts, which contained anything from £50 to £250. InHiroshima, where I lectured and made two television appearances in the PeacePark, they paid me more than £800. Joy, who felt we ought not to be making moneyout of the miseries of Hiroshima, wanted to donate the money to the Hibakshi –survivors of the atom bomb – but our hosts flatly refused to take it.During the rest of that tour I had to make constant use of the ‘St Neot Margintrick’: arousing my mind to a state of intense concentration by envisaging somecrisis. (That episode of losing Sally in Cheltenham was a useful startingpoint.) It was not the temples that caused my vitality to slump – they wereoften fascinating, with their rock gardens and pools and demon guardians. Theproblem lay in the lunches, even if they were only noodles and beer. After thisthere might be hundreds of steps to climb, often covered with cherry blossoms,to reach a temple that looked down on a precipitous valley with a waterfall.There was no point in climbing mechanically; the mind had to be concentrateduntil all this was more than a kind of dream.This point had struck me forcefully after reading a passage in the writings ofKobo daishi. It was a discourse by the Taoist monk Kyobu, after listening to theremarks of a Confucian monk. He explains that, in olden times, people drank theblood of a sacrificial animal and made a vow before listening to the doctrinesof the Emperor Huang, and were therefore in the right state of attentiveness toabsorb them. Wisdom cannot be attained by merely listening to words of wisdomwithout preparation.So when I entered a temple, I did my best to still my mind completely, toachieve simultaneously a state of relaxation combined with wide-awakeness, as iflistening for some very faint sound, or perhaps to the silence itself. And if Idid this for a few minutes, my relaxation would deepen – my panic attacks hadtaught me how to do this – and the silence would seem to yield new depths, as ifI had penetrated to the other side of silence. I believe it was the templesthemselves that caused this to happen. Centuries of prayer and meditation hadimprinted themselves on the place itself, so that I responded to it like adowser to water. It made no difference if I was tired after climbing hundreds ofsteps; a state of deep inner calm would descend fairly quickly. And in thisstate, I occasionally experienced brief flashes of an underlying reality thatwas not normally accessible to the senses, the timeless reality I hadoccasionally glimpsed in my teens when meditating on the Bhagavad Gita.I was also struck by Kyobu’s remark: ‘When you see a beautiful girl with aslender waist, think of her as a devil or ghost.’ Kobo daishi recognised whathad become increasingly clear to me since writing the Criminal History: that sexis an illusion that is designed to persuade us to propagate the species, andthat it does so by filling us with a kind of fever. At that time, the Americanmurderer Ted Bundy was much in my mind, since I had written about him in theCriminal History. Bundy had been passing a lighted window on the campus of theUniversity of Washington, in Seattle, when he had glimpsed a girl gettingundressed. It had produced such a violent fever of desire that from then on hehad spent all his evenings peering through windows. He had, in his own words,‘turned it into a project’. Inevitably, he finally began breaking into thebedrooms and attacking the women. Then he graduated to abducting the girls,driving them to some distant place, and spending hours violating them. And now,at the time I was in Japan, he was on Death Row in Florida, awaiting execution –an appalling example of a man who had been dragged down to the depths by thesexual illusion.On that first trip to Japan, I met a man who had been caught in the samewhirlpool. His name was Issei Sagawa, and ten years before he introduced himselfto me at a book signing, he had killed a girl and eaten parts of her body.He had been a student at the Sorbonne at the time, taking a degree inliterature, and had become fascinated by a Dutch classmate named RenéeHartevelt. Ever since he had been a teenager, Issei had dreamed about beautifulblondes – not making love to them, but killing them and eating them. One day heinvited her to his flat, ostensibly to teach him German, and, as she sat readingpoetry aloud, shot her in the back of the neck. Then he undressed her, rapedher, sliced off one of her buttocks and ate part of it raw. He told me that ashe did so, he was in an intense state of sexual excitement.He dismembered the body in the bath, then bought two suitcases with wheels, andasked a taxi driver to take him to the Bois de Bologne. When a coupleapproached, he fled, leaving the suitcases, and the mystified pair looked inside…He was easily caught – the taxi driver took the police to the flat. In therefrigerator, they found more of Renée’s body, wrapped in greaseproof paper.At first investigators assumed it to be a crime passionel. But when he told theexamining magistrate about his lifelong desire to eat a girl, he was certifiedinsane and confined in a mental home. Eventually he was released and returned toJapan, where he became a celebrity. A book he wrote about the murder soldhundreds of thousands of copies.What fascinated me as I listened to his story was his explanation of how it hadall come about. He had been born prematurely, so was always a tiny child. Whenhe was three, his father and uncle had played a game in which his uncle was awicked giant and his father a good knight. They fought over Issei and hisbrother, and the good knight was killed, and the two children placed in acooking pot.From then on, Issei’s daydreams were about being cooked and eaten, which gavehim a peculiar sexual thrill. And when, as a teenager, he began to experiencesexual desire, it was not to make love to a girl, but to eat her. In Paris, hestared at the bare arms of girls in cafés, and dreamed of how they would taste.Finally, with only a few weeks to go before he returned to Japan, he felt it wastime to act. That was when he bought a carbine, and invited Renée Hartevelt backto his flat.On a later visit to Tokyo, I agreed to do a long interview with Issei for amagazine. It took place in my hotel suite. Joy was horrified at the idea ofmeeting him, and went out for the afternoon. But when she returned, Issei wasstill there. As I introduced her she shrank away and did not offer her hand. Andwhen she heard me inviting Issei to the Press Club for dinner, she drew me asideand whispered: ‘If they recognise him they’ll order you both to leave.’She was wrong. We had an excellent dinner – I think Issei ate raw lamb – and Joysat next to him. He was small, with hands like a child, and obviously shy andnervous. And after we had put him in a taxi, she said: ‘What a delightful man!’She had recognised – what I knew from the beginning – that Issei was not amonster, but simply a man who, for reasons even he did not understand, had beenhypnotised by the sexual illusion.Such thoughts were in my mind as we visited the temples. I recall attending anofficial meal when a geisha knelt beside me, refilling my glass or replenishingmy plate. It was easy to see how, in this culture where women occupied asubordinate position, such a girl might also be expected to perform sexualservices. And since she was slim and pretty, the thought induced a pleasantexcitement. Yet another part of me, the part that had learned to sink into deeprelaxation in the temples, looked on with total detachment, aware that she waslike a sticky sweet that would make me feel sick.Compared to these insights, the actual ceremony to celebrate the thousandthanniversary of Koyasan seemed almost anticlimactic. The temple was vast, andopen on four sides. The three guests – myself, Lyall Watson and Fritjof Capra –sat in the centre of this temple, with an enormous mandala behind us, so thatthree quarters of the audience could not even see us. In the morning there was aBuddhist service, and we watched the monks parade in. It was cool, but I waswearing a leather overcoat and scarf, and when my feet got cold, I slipped theminto my hat. Lyall Watson and Capra were thinly clad and sat there with theirteeth chattering. At 2 o’clock they rushed back to their rooms for warmunderwear.In the afternoon I opened the symposium by briefly explaining the ‘pyramid ofconsciousness’, a concept I had developed in my book on Wilhelm Reich: thateveryday consciousness has a disjointed quality that could be compared to abilliard table covered with scattered balls. When we concentrate, they cometogether in the middle of the table. But in moments of intense concentration, itis as if the balls started climbing on top of one another to form a secondlayer. If we could concentrate so hard that they formed a pyramid, it wouldnever collapse, for sheer intensity would create a feedback effect that wouldmake it permanent. This, I said, was probably close to what Kobo daishi called‘enlightenment in this very existence’. And later, in a longer address, Iexpanded the concept by talking about Faculty X – when we are in a state thatinduces an awareness of the reality of the past.Meanwhile, the audience of a thousand or so sat in the cold, most of them unableto see the speakers, while Joy and I thanked our lucky stars that we were amongthe guests of honour who had been provided with blankets to cover our knees, andsmall bags of chemicals which glowed like hot water bottles. That afternoon mademe realise that the monks who founded Koyasan must have had enough discomfortsto turn them all into saints. Forty-eight hours later, Joy and I landed at Sydney, and there we separated, Joyon her way to see her brother Neil in Townsville, and I for Melbourne.There I immediately became aware of the contrast between the manners of theJapanese and those of the Australians. I needed a phone card, and went into theoffice of the airline to ask where I could buy one. The girl behind the counterstared at me as if I was mad, then told me I would have to apply to thetelephone company. I walked fifty yards down the concourse and enquired at thenewsagent; they immediately sold me one. So on my way back to my gate, I calledin the airline office and told the girl that if anyone asked about a phone cardin future, she could simply direct them to the newsagent. She glared at mevirulently and snapped ‘Oh thenkyou!’In Melbourne I was scheduled to give more lectures, the main one being atLatrobe University, where my friend Howard Dossor, who was writing a book aboutme, was an administrator. He was waiting at the gate to meet me, and beside himwas my old girlfriend of my Coffee House days, Carole Ann – still, in hermid-forties, as pretty as ever.After our affair in 1955, Carole Ann had gone to a singing teacher, anddiscovered she had an excellent soprano voice. She met an Australian actor namedTerry Gill, married him and emigrated to Australia. In Melbourne they opened arestaurant and music hall called The Naughty Nineties, and became a celebratedhusband and wife team. They enjoyed performing duets from light operas, andmusicals like The Phantom of the Opera. I spent a pleasant evening there and wasamazed that Carole Ann had become such a fine soprano.Terry was a big, good-natured man who reminded me of my younger brother Barry,so I liked him instantly.I had seen Carole Ann in London over the years, for she was the kind of personwho likes to keep in touch with old friends. She had kept her figure trim withdaily workouts in the gym, whereas I had put on a great deal of weight – awriter’s occupational hazard.As to Howard Dossor, who had arranged this lecture trip to Melbourne, he hadwritten to me two years earlier, and then come to see me. Before becoming auniversity administrator, he had been a clergyman – a profession that might beguessed from his gentle, earnest manner. Then he had become ill with cancer, andbeen told that he had only a year to live. He had always been interested in myideas, and now decided to devote the time he had left to writing a book aboutme. The cancer had been cured, but by then he had lost his Christian faith – anoutcome he attributes partly to me, and partly to his study of the Greeknovelist Nikos Kazantzakis, whom I also admired. So he became an academic, andalso began a collection of my work which must be the largest in the world.Latrobe University proved to be a beautiful campus, green and spacious. But whatstartled me about it was the amount of litter that had been left lying around.This was not due to the lack of janitors or of litter bins, but to the fact thatstudents preferred to throw newspapers, plastic bags, beer cans or paper cups onthe ground or in a flower bed when there was a litter bin a few feet away. Afterthe cleanness of Japan’s streets and campuses, there was something oddlyshocking about this untidiness, and I made a note in my journal for the book onserial killers I was planning, to the effect that this lack of a sense ofresponsibility is the beginning of criminality.The point seemed to be underlined by a murder case that was making the headlineson the day I landed. A married couple from Perth, David and Catherine Birnie,had been arrested and charged with the abduction and murder of four women in thepast four weeks. Birnie, a slightly built man in his thirties, was apparentlysexually insatiable, and needed sex six times a day. He worked in acar-wrecker’s yard and sold spare parts. And when a 22-year-old student came tothe house to buy tyres, Birnie was unable to resist, and forced her into thebedroom at knife-point, then raped her while his wife looked on. She was thentaken to a secluded place, where he raped her again, then strangled her. Thesame thing happened to three more girls, the only difference being that Birniekept them captive for days while raping them. One was strangled by the wife, whofelt her husband was taking too much interest in her. A fifth victim, aseventeen-year old girl, succeeded in escaping after three days, and gave thealarm.Birnie was the perfect example of what I meant by the sexual illusion. My friendRonald Duncan had often questioned me about my interest in crime, evidentlysuspecting some sinister perversion. He could not understand that when I studieda murder case I suddenly became aware of this problem of illusion and reality.In Koyasan and the other temples I caught a clear glimpse of reality; suchglimpses are not easy to find in the modern world. But a murder case made meaware of these values by their absence, like a shadow cast on a whitewashedwall. I experienced the same thing to a far lesser degree looking at the beercans on the Latrobe campus. It was not, of course, that Australia lacked thesevalues more than England or America, but that the contrast with Japan made itmore obvious.Where evil was concerned I had always been a platonist – that is, I felt thatthere is no evil as such, but that everyone is striving towards his own ideal ofgood. But the Birnie case raised some doubts, and I found myself wonderingwhether this might be more than a case of clinical hyper-sexuality, and be somekind of ‘possession’ by an active force of evil.Another story I heard in Melbourne strengthened that suspicion. Howard Dossorintroduced me to a remarkable painter called Bert Tucker, whose work was ashighly regarded as that of Sidney Nolan. And Bert told me of an extraordinaryexperience that made me deeply thoughtful.Some years earlier, Bert had spent an evening eating dinner at the home offriends, and set out to walk home late at night. He was living in a room in aboarding house. But as he came closer to home, he began to experience a curioussense of reluctance to go back. He told himself this was absurd, and forcedhimself to walk on, yet the feeling became stronger and then, as he mounted thestairs, overpowering. As he walked into the room he was assailed by a revoltingstench – like the smell of hot, wet fur in zoos. As he stood fighting off terror– still convinced that this was all absurd – he saw something on the coverlet ofhis bed. It was a dead mouse. It was lying with its legs spread out, and a trailof urine behind it that had still not soaked into the bedsheet. And when hereached out and touched it, the body was still warm – it had only just died.Suddenly he knew that if he spent the night in the room he would not walk outalive. So he hurried back to his friends and spent the night there.What was it? He told me that the landlady had an idiot son, who was in an asylummost of the time, but occasionally came home for the weekend. He was home thatweekend, in the room below Bert’s. His presence, Bert felt, had broughtsomething evil into the house.And some other force – perhaps his ‘guardian angel’ – had done its best to warnhim. And, when he refused to accept that warning, had killed the mouse on hisbed.The conclusion, it seemed, was that there are indeed forces of good as well asevil, and both could intervene actively in our world. It was a good time to start thinking again about the problems of the paranormal,for my editor at HarperCollins, Jim Cochrane, had asked me if I would like towrite another book on ‘the occult’. At the time, it was the last thing I wantedto do; I felt I had said everything I had to say in The Occult and Mysteries.But my experiences in Japan, and Bert’s story about the mouse, made me feelthere was still a lot I had overlooked. I spent a great deal of time during thatweek in Melbourne and the journey home thinking about the new book.A good starting point seemed to be an extraordinary story told to me by myfriend Mark Bredin, a concert pianist. One late evening after a concert, he wasreturning home in a taxi along the Bayswater Road, when he suddenly knew withabsolute certainty that at the Queensway traffic light, a taxi would try to jumpthe light and hit them sideways. He wondered if he should tell his driver, thenfelt the man would think him mad. But at the next traffic light, a taxi tried tojump the light and hit them sideways.How could he know the future? Presumably because he was totally relaxed and wasusing some odd ability we all possess. The historian A. L. Rowse had told me howone afternoon, in his college rooms, he suddenly knew that if he crossed twoquadrangles and went into the library, he would find two young men embracing. Hehurried there and found them, as he expected, in one another’s arms.Another friend told me a story that seemed equally strange. Kay Lunnis, whooften spent days in our house helping Joy to look after the children, told ushow, when she was seriously ill in hospital, she had felt herself rise above herbody so she could look down on it. I would once have dismissed this as ahallucination due to fever, but I had come across too many such cases of‘out-of-the-body experiences’ since I began studying the paranormal.I had used these stories in The Occult, yet it had never struck me that itimplies some unknown power of the human mind, which becomes available when weare deeply relaxed. How could I call myself an existentialist if I failed totake such powers into account?T. E. Lawrence was obviously in the same state of relaxation when he experiencedthat feeling of complete wakefulness as he set out in the dawn that awakened thesenses before the intellect. Relaxation seems to be the common denominator ofsuch experiences.But I was also aware that too much relaxation can be dangerous. I recalled animpressive story told to me by my friend Joyce Collin-Smith, the sister-in-lawof one of Ouspenky’s most brilliant disciples, Rodney Collin. In August 1960,she became a follower of the Hindu guru, the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who wasconvinced that the world could be transformed by ‘transcendental meditation’.She described how she had gone to the house the Maharishi had rented nearRegent’s Park, taking a flower as an offering. The Maharishi, a little man witha high voice and a sing-song Indian accent, taught her a brief mantra inSanskrit, which immediately brought a strange, deep sense of peace. He told herto go and sit near the window, on the carpet. As she did so, the mantra seemedto be repeating itself in her brain without her volition. Time slippedpeacefully by – three hours – before she noticed the evening traffic in thestreet, and realised she had to get home to cook her husband’s dinner.From then on, the mantra would plunge her into the same deep state of blissfulserenity. She saw the Maharishi do the same thing repeatedly – once a long queuestretched down the corridor of a hotel in Oxford, and the Maharishi saw eachperson in turn, accepted the flower, then touched the donor on the forehead andtold him to go and sit down – and all obviously experienced the sameinstantaneous feeling of peace.Joyce was by then acting as the Maharishi’s unpaid secretary, and it was she whotook a phone call from the management saying that an old lady who lived on thesame floor was complaining about the noise and threatening to leave. Joyce askedthe Maharishi: ‘What shall we do?’ ‘Do nothing,’ said the Maharishi, smilingbenevolently. ‘It will be all right.’ And so it was. They heard nothing morefrom the old lady.This was one of many examples of the Maharishi’s powers, which were to someextent telepathic – as was illustrated on another occasion, when he read Joyce’smind as she sat in the audience listening to him, and answered the question shemeant to ask.Every one of the Maharishi’s followers seemed to be happy and light-hearted; hewas surrounded by an atmosphere of gaiety. But Joyce soon noticed that not allwas well. Some of the disciples began spending more and more time sitting in astate of bliss, and it was obvious that they were becoming less capable ofcoping with everyday life. They didn’t want to come back and face reality.Joyce herself began to experience something more disturbing. She found itincreasingly difficult to focus her mind, and seemed to see too deep into theunderlying reality of things. She had always understood intellectually thateverything changes, but now she could actually see it happening. Looking at herhands, she would see them change into the hands of a child, and at the same timeinto the hands of an old woman, then into a skeleton. Looking at a chair, shecould see it as new timber still smelling of sap, and as a worn-out old chairabout to be thrown on the bonfire. Everything fluctuated all the time.Finally she could stand it no longer, and decided to commit suicide. She took arope and went to a tree in the garden.But as she looked at the rope, she suddenly noticed that it was staying still,remaining unchanged. Instead of dissolving into strands, then into flax, orbecoming old and frayed, it was holding steady. The emergency had shaken hersubconscious mind awake. Which meant that she had to set out to train her mindto fix her attention on the present. And as soon as she learned to do this, theproblem went away.By this time she was becoming disillusioned with the Maharishi, who was changingfrom a child-like guru into a super-tycoon, so she left the movement.Joyce had discovered same trick I had learned to control the panic attacks:focusing the mind to prevent it from wavering. The answer lies in one word:attention.The Japanese master Ikkyu was asked by a workman to write something on histablet. He wrote: ‘Attention.’ The workman looked disappointed. ‘Can’t you writesomething else?’ So Ikkyu wrote: ‘Attention, attention.’ The workman asked: ‘Butwhat does attention mean?’ Ikkyu replied: ‘Attention means attention.’In fact, concentrated attention enables us to push the mind up to the level thatI have labelled ‘higher focus’. And in states of higher focus we experience arush of energy.So I began writing the book that would become Beyond the Occult, into which Itried to put everything about mysticism and the paranormal I had learned in thepast twenty years. I regard it as my best book. It contains two insights that Ifeel are among the most important I ever had.The first illustrates how difficult it is to recall such insights later.It came when I was driving up to Plymouth to meet someone at BBC Television todiscuss a series about the paranormal. As it flashed into my head, I saw at oncethat it was one of those basic unifying insights that I ought to make an intenseeffort to remember. Luckily, I had a pocket tape recorder with me, and talkedinto it as I drove along. Then I had lunch with the producer, drove home – andcompletely forgot about the insight.Some months later, I was driving again to Plymouth when I recalled that I hadhad an important insight on this same stretch of road. But it simply refused tocome back. Then I remembered the tape recording. It was hard to find – I hadmade several tapes since then – but I finally located it. And I realised that itwas, indeed, a major insight, and that I had come close to losing itpermanently.I called the insight ‘upside-downness’, meaning the state in which negativeemotions can stand us on our heads, producing a mild form of insanity. A personsuffering from frantic jealousy is suffering from upside downness; so is someoneconsumed by hatred or egoism or envy.When we are ‘the right way up’ we see the world practically and rationally.Strong emotions or unpleasant physical sensations can completely distort ournormal view of things.You could say that most of us can be divided into three people, and thesecorrespond to the mind, the emotions and the body. In our social lives, the mindis, in effect, the ruler. If we become very ill – if, for example, we aresuffering from high fever – the body becomes the ruler. But this is rare, and inany case, we are accustomed to the body’s vagaries, so it doesn’t bother us allthat much.Emotions are a different matter. Strong emotions can be like a violent stormthat sweeps away all rationality. And if we allow ourselves to be taken in bythem, it is exactly as if our feet have turned into gas-filled balloons and wesuddenly find ourselves floating upside-down.We might turn this into a parable in the manner of Confucius, and say that whenthe intellect is the emperor, and the emotions the grand vizier, the kingdom isharmonious and happy. But when emotions usurp the throne and force the emperorto become their servant, the kingdom descends into misery and chaos.Moreover, when we allow upside-downness to provoke us into doing somethingabsurd and self-defeating, we invariably tell ourselves that we were justifiedbecause we were placed under intolerable pressure.Here is an example. An American friend of mine, who had been a close friend ofthe film star James Dean, told me that he had become so angry at being stuck ina New York traffic jam that he simply abandoned his car and went into thenearest cinema. Of course, he was heavily fined – but he told me it was ‘worthit’. He genuinely felt that he had made a justified protest, in the true spiritof James Dean, against New York traffic.Many serial sex killers operate on the same logic, declaring that all women arewhores, and deserve what they get. Without exception, they are ‘Right Men’.Of course, such instances convince you and me that we are not in the least likethat. But we are forgetting that ‘being the right way up’ requires a kind ofeffort similar to the effort a baby has to make to walk upright; most peopleexperience dozens of brief episodes of upside-downness every day, while someapparently normal people are like it most of the time.The appalling truth is that upside-downness is one of the worst perils we face.You could almost imagine it as a kind of homicidal demon whose job is to depressand discourage us, and whose ultimate triumph would be to make us commitsuicide. He seldom shows his face, preferring to inject depression and wearinessby stealth. But his activities are easy enough to observe when you feelenergetic and confident – that is, in a state of ‘spring morning consciousness’.Then you notice how easy it is to slip into fatigue and self-doubt. And beforeyou know where you are, the vizier has tossed the emperor off the throne andtaken his place.As a teenager I woke up almost every morning with a watery feeling of anxiety inthe pit of my stomach, expecting the day to bring unspecified miseries andhumiliations. That was upside-downness. But the sense of revelation that came onspring mornings was a sudden glimpse of man’s future destiny – consciousnesswithout upside-downness. This is why Maslow’s students had had peak experiencesas soon as they began to talk and think about peak experiences: they saw thatconsciousness without upside-downness is a normal potentiality of human beings.And the moment they saw this they turned the right way up.The second of my insights came when I was in California in 1987.Two friends had driven me from San Francisco to the Esalen Institute at Big Sur,where I had to lecture. As I climbed into the car for the return drive, I beganthinking about levels of consciousness, and seeing how many I could distinguish.I decided to begin with the basic state of non-consciousness we experience indeep sleep, and to call this Level 0. So Level 1 is the dream state, whichshades off into the hypnagogic (semi-waking) state.Level 2 is ‘mere awareness’, as when you are gazing blankly out of the window,thinking of nothing. In a sense, ‘you’ are not really there at all.In Level 3 we have become self-aware, but consciousness is dull and heavy.Sartre calls it ‘nausea’. Every act of will costs a tremendous effort.Level 4 is our ordinary everyday consciousness. But life still seems a hardbattle, and it is easy to sink back towards ‘nausea’. This is what ChristinaRossetti meant when she wrote: > Does the road wind uphill all the way?> Yes, to the very end …But as you struggle on, sheer doggedness seems to generate a feeling ofstrength, and at about halfway up Level 4, you begin to get a suspicion thatperhaps you can win after all. Consciousness ceases to be dull and passive, andsuddenly becomes active. And a rising feeling of optimism often culminates inthe peak experience. This might be regarded as a kind of spark that leaps thegap between Level 4 and Level 5.So what is Level 5? This is the state I sometimes call ‘spring morningconsciousness’ – a bubbling sense of vitality, a feeling that ‘all is well’.Life suddenly becomes self-evidently rich and infinitely exciting. This is thestate Graham Greene experienced after playing Russian roulette.Level 6 could be called ‘magical consciousness’. It is what a child often feelson Christmas Day. Or imagine two honeymooners on a balcony overlooking a moonlitlake, with dark shapes of mountains in the distance, and a feeling that life isgood and will continue to be good. In Level 6, just being awake seems to be acontinuous mild peak experience.As to Level 7, this is what I have called Faculty X, a state in which we areaware of the reality of other times and places. They seem as real as the presentmoment.Level 7 is the highest level that need concern us as human beings – that is, thehighest level we can achieve by sheer effort. The level that lies beyond this,Level 8, is ‘mystical consciousness, and is so paradoxical andself-contradictory that it lies beyond the reach of the will. The only person Ican recall who offered a more or less comprehensible description is Gurdjieff’sdisciple P. D. Ouspensky. It is to be found in his book A New Model of theUniverse, in a chapter called ‘Experimental Mysticism’.Ouspensky does not tell us the details of how he achieved his states of mysticalconsciousness, but his biographer James Webb is probably correct in assumingthat he used yogic and magical methods combined with the use of some sort ofdrug, almost certainly nitrous oxide – ‘laughing gas’. Ouspensky states that thechange took place more quickly and easily than he had expected. The account thatfollows is one of the most important and detailed in the whole literature ofmysticism.‘The unknown’, Ouspensky says, ‘is unlike anything that we can suppose about it.The complete unexpectedness of everything that is met with in these experiences,from great to small, makes the description of them difficult.’ And he goes on tomake an observation of central importance: > First of all, everything is unified, everything is linked together, everything> is explained by something else and in turn explains another thing. There is> nothing separate, that is, nothing that can be named or described separately.> In order to describe the first impressions, the first sensations, it is> necessary to describe all at once. The new world with which one comes into> contact has no sides, so that it is impossible to describe first one side and> then the other. All of it is visible at every point … Here we have one of the most basic assertions that all descriptions of mysticalexperience have in common. Everything is seen to be connected. And the word‘seen’ deserves to be underlined. This world of infinite relationships, in whicheverything is connected with everything else, is seen all at once – from abird’s-eye view, as it were. And language instantly becomes useless, because itcan only pin down one thing at a time. ‘A man becomes lost amidst the infinitenumber of totally new impressions, for the expression of which he has neitherwords nor forms.’What seems equally strange is that the normal sense of the distinction betweenobjective and subjective disappeared: > Here I saw that the objective and the subjective could change places. The one> could become the other. It is very difficult to express this. The habitual> mistrust of the subjective disappeared; every thought, every feeling, every> image, was immediately objectified in real substantial forms which differed in> no way from the forms of objective phenomena; and at the same time objective> phenomena somehow disappeared, lost all reality, appeared entirely subjective,> fictitious, invented, having no real existence … He goes on to say that this strange world resembled more than anything else ‘aworld of very complicated mathematical relations’.This vision of infinite meaning made it very difficult to carry on aconversation, for between each word of the sentence so many ideas occurred thatit was difficult for Ouspensky to remember what he intended to say next. Hebegan a sentence with the words, ‘I said yesterday …’ but could simply get nofurther. The word ‘I’ raised hundreds of insights about the meaning of I, theword ‘said’ raised just as many ideas about speech and self-expression, each ofwhich produced ‘an explosion of thoughts, conjectures, comparisons andassociations’, and the word ‘yesterday’ led to endless thoughts and ideas aboutthe nature of time, so that he was left with a feeling of breathlessness thatmade it impossible to continue.Something strange also happened to his sense of time, so that when his companionspoke, there seemed to be an immense gap between each of his words. ‘When he hadfinished a short sentence, the meaning of which did not reach me at all, I feltI had lived through so much during that time that we should never be able tounderstand one another again, that I had gone too far from him.’All this, says Ouspensky, was accompanied by immensely powerful emotionalstates. ‘I took in everything through feeling, and experienced emotions whichnever exist in life.’ His inner world became a kaleidoscope of ‘joy, wonder,rapture, horror, continually changing one into the other’. The state seemed toallow access to infinite knowledge, but when he looked for the answer to anyparticular question, it ‘began far away and, gradually widening, includedeverything, so that finally the answer to the question included the answers toall possible questions’. He encountered the same problem when he looked atphysical objects: an ashtray seemed to arouse an infinite succession of meaningsand associations, so that he scrawled on a slip of paper: ‘A man can go mad fromone ashtray.’ And the ashtray, like everything else, seemed to be communicatingwith him, almost as if it had a voice.The remainder of Ouspensky’s description is too long and detailed to quote hereeven in summary. His experiments usually ended in sleep, and his awakening thenext morning was a dreary and disappointing experience. The ordinary worldseemed unutterably dull: > … this world contained something extraordinarily oppressive: it was incredibly> empty, colourless and lifeless. It was as though everything in it was wooden,> as if it was an enormous wooden machine with creaking wooden wheels, wooden> thoughts, wooden moods, wooden sensations; everything was terribly slow,> scarcely moved, or moved with a melancholy wooden creaking. Everything was> dead, soulless, feelingless.> They were terrible, these moments of awakening in an unreal world after a real> one, in a dead world after a living, in a limited world, cut into small> pieces, after an infinite and entire world. In other words it is as if man found himself stranded on a planet whose gravitywas so enormous that he was unable to stand upright – unable even to crawl onhis hands and knees without immense effort. (Gurdjieff once said that our worldis the cosmic equivalent of Outer Siberia.) In this iron world even thought istrapped by the tremendous gravity, so that it has to drag itself along theground like a wounded animal. For the most part consciousness is little morethan a mere reflection of the environment, and life is basically a meresuccession of visual images, of being ‘here and now’. This is why our worldseems to be ‘cut into small pieces’, why its basic characteristic is‘separateness’. If you were utterly exhausted as you read this page it woulddissolve into separate words, and even if you succeeded in grasping the meaningof an individual sentence the total meaning of the paragraph would still eludeyou. This is what our world is like. Everything stands separate anddisconnected, and we have become so accustomed to this state of affairs that weassume that it is natural and inevitable. Yet it is not natural, any more thanit is natural to fail to grasp the meaning of a sentence. And we realise thisevery time a spring morning fills us with a sense of the sheer interestingnessof the world. ‘Separateness’ is unnatural; the true and natural state of affairsis a basic ‘connectedness’, just as Ouspensky realised during his mysticalexperiments.In short this world, which seems to us so oppressively real, has been robbed ofa dimension of reality by the feebleness of human consciousness and itsinability to function efficiently in the powerful gravitational field of ouruniverse. This is only a part of the problem. What turns a difficult situationinto a dangerous one is that our mental numbness deprives us of all sense ofdirection, so that most human beings have given up any attempt to see things asa whole. In effect most of us waste our lives battling against the difficultiesof the present moment, and when life offers us the occasional breathing space weare inclined to waste it in boredom or the search for amusement. This is whyman, who is fundamentally a well-disposed and sociable creature, is capable ofso much evil where his fellow-creatures are concerned. The harsh Siberianenvironment has made him brutal and short-sighted. Yet every flash of poetic ormystical insight makes us instantly aware that such a view is, quite literally,an absurdity.One thing seems clear: the world glimpsed in these moments of insight is morereal than the world of everyday reality. And everyone who has experienced theseglimpses has seen the same thing; it always involves a sense of no longer beingat the mercy of circumstance, of being a slave of material reality and our ownbodies. We possess ‘hidden powers’, tremendous reserves of unsuspected strength.Equally fascinating are Ouspensky’s insights about time. In his ‘ExperimentalMysticism’ chapter, Ouspensky offers some clues about how these ideas weredeveloped. He speaks of the curious feeling of a ‘lengthening of time’, aspeeding up so that seconds seem to turn into years or decades. He emphasisesthat the normal feeling of time remained as a background to this ‘acceleratedtime’, so that he was – so to speak – living in two ‘times’ at once. Ourordinary time merely has ‘duration’, but the second time has ‘speed’. And sincetime has a flow from past to future, it would also seem to possess a thirddimension – ‘direction’.It is because we are stuck in time that it seems inevitable that one eventfollows another like the notes on a piano keyboard. But, says Ouspensky, if timehas three dimensions, if it is a ‘cube’ and not a line, and its forward flow cango up or down or sideways within a three-dimensional space, this obviously meansthat the next point on the line is not rigidly predetermined. It might go up ordown or sideways. Life is full of non-actualised potentialities, says Ouspenskyin the ‘Eternal Recurrence’ chapter of A New Model of the Universe, and when itcomes to an end it starts all over again, so we go on living the same life forever. Yet within this repetitive pattern there is room for infinite freedom.So it does not have to be exactly the same: only dull and lazy people live thesame life over and over again. More determined people strive to actualise theirpotentialities, and although the events are predetermined, like the notes of asymphony, they can be transformed by a great conductor. So their lives arechanged infinitesimally each time.It follows that the future is, to a large extent, predetermined. On one occasionOuspensky asked himself whether communication with the dead was a possibilityand immediately ‘saw’ someone with whom he urgently wanted to communicate. Butwhat he ‘saw’ was not the person but his whole life, in a kind offour-dimensional continuum. At that moment Ouspensky realised that it waspointless to feel guilt about his own failure to be more helpful to thisparticular person because the events of this person’s life were as unchangeableas the features of his face. ‘Nobody could have changed anything in them, justas nobody could have changed the colour of his hair or eyes, or the shape of hisnose …’ In other words, what happened to the man was his ‘destiny’.It was also during these experiments that Ouspensky had a clear premonition thathe would not be going to Moscow that Easter, as he fully intended to. He wasable to foresee a sequence of events that would make his visit impossible. Andin due course this sequence occurred exactly as he had foreseen it in hismystical state. Ouspensky, therefore, had no doubt that precognition is areality. (J. B. Priestley borrowed Ouspensky’s idea for his third ‘time play’, IHave Been Here Before, in which a thoroughly unsatisfactory character who hascommitted suicide out of self-pity makes a determined effort the ‘second timeround’, and makes an altogether better job of his life.)So, excluding the weird and paradoxical Level 8, I had worked out the basic‘normal’ levels of consciousness. The above, I believe, gives a fairly completeaccount of my view of human consciousness and its potentialities. Theinteresting thing is that up to the halfway point – Level 4½ consciousness ispassive. Beyond 4½, it is as if you have reached a mountain top, and the goingis now all downhill; consciousness has become active.To grasp this is obviously of immense importance, for once you know that acertain effort will take you to Level 5 and beyond, you become unstoppable.There is a law of consciousness which states: the stronger it becomes, thestronger it is capable of becoming. And the method involves focused attention.Upside-downness and the seven levels of consciousness are central to theargument of Beyond the Occult. But most of the book is taken up by examples of‘strange powers’, like the ability to foresee the future or have out-of-the-bodyexperiences.Equally important are the many ‘mystical’ glimpses that have been experiencedunder everyday circumstances. In a book called A Drug Taker’s Notes, R. H. Warddescribes his experience under dental gas – nitrous oxide – and says: ‘I passedafter a few inhalations of the gas directly into a state of consciousnessalready far more complete than the fullest degree of ordinary wakingconsciousness.’ And the following is an account by a sixteen-year-old girl asshe was walking up a lane towards a wood:‘I was not feeling particularly happy or particularly sad, just ordinary.’ Asshe stood in the cornfield looking towards the wood, everything changed. > Everything surrounding me was this white, bright, sparkling light, like the> sun on frosty snow, like a million diamonds, and there was no cornfield, no> trees, no sky, this light was everywhere … The feeling was indescribable, but> I have never experienced anything in the years that followed that I can> compare with that glorious moment; it was blissful, uplifting, I felt> open-mouthed wonder. Then the tops of the trees became visible once again,> then a piece of sky, then the light was no more, and the cornfield was spread> before me. I stood there for a long time, trying in vain for it to come back,> and have tried many times, but I only saw it once; but I know in my heart it> is still there – and here – around us.1 This, it seems to me, is the kind of experience we need to recall when wediscuss philosophy and the nature of reality. This, as Blake knew, is whatreality is really like. In August 1989, Joy and I went on a trip to a little French town called ChaiseDieu, in the Auvergne. We were travelling by bus with a group from the TorquayGramophone Society, to hear the Bach St John Passion in the medieval AbbeyChurch. The day before we left, we were taken on a trip to a volcanic mountaincalled the Puy de Dome, above Clermont.On the bus Joy was reading a French newspaper, when suddenly she began to shakewith laughter. The item described how a group of East Germans who had takenrefuge in Hungary (which was then a Communist country) had been given permissionto picnic close to the border with West Germany, and lost no time in hot-footingit across the frontier and vanishing into the distance.Neither of us had the least idea that we were seeing the beginning of thedownfall of Communism. Yet I should have had an inkling. In a symposium calledMarx Refuted (1987), which I edited with Ronald Duncan, I had foretold thedownfall of Communism two years before it happened. On the last page of thebook, I had written: > The attempted uprisings in Hungary and Czechoslovakia suggested that [the> downfall of Communism] might not take as long as that: that human nature> itself might revolt long before prosperity made it inevitable. Now in the> 1980s, we become aware of a more startling possibility. Events in Chile, in> Afghanistan, in Poland, suggest the possibility of a world in which communism> has simply vanished, overturned by the masses it is supposed to represent.> History is not always gradual. The ‘witchcraft craze’ collapsed quite> suddenly, in Europe and America; at one moment it seemed as strong as ever; in> the next it had disappeared … And so, during the next two years, I watched with awe as something I had neverdared to hope actually came about. I told my mother: ‘You’re lucky. You’ve livedlong enough to see the downfall of the Soviet Union.’But then, she had never been much interested in politics, so was not all thatimpressed. 1 From Seeing the Invisible: Modern Religious and Other TranscendentExperiences, ed. Meg Maxwell and Verena Tschudin, Penguin 1990."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22> THE ANCIENT ONESIt was on that first trip to Japan, when I was in a hotel in Nara, the site ofthe largest Buddhist temple in Japan, that I had received a phone call from NewYork asking me if I would go there the following year to lecture at the OpenCenter. This had been founded in the belief that New Yorkers are as interestedin New Age thought as Californians, and this had proved correct. During the nextten years I was to return there many times. I would also return to Japan andAustralia. But since travel bores me, and writing about it bores me even more, Ishall not describe these.Back from our travels we were met off the train by Don Seaman. He was in hisusual financial straits, and I had to lend him £2,000 in anticipation of theJapanese advance on the scandal book. But he repaid me by giving me an excellentidea for a new book, asking: ‘Why don’t you write a book called The SexualMisfits?’ And since my mind was full of the notion of the sexual illusion, thisstruck me as an ideal subject, and I lost no time in persuading my publisher tocommission it.I felt it was high time to write a sequel to Origins of the Sexual Impulse. AndI had an ideal starting point: an extraordinary Hungarian lady called CharlotteBach, who in 1971 had sent me a vast and incomprehensible typescript on sex.When I finally succeeded in working out what she was talking about, I discoveredthat it was highly original: that all men are possessed by a basic urge tobecome women, and all women by an urge to become men. She saw the inner tensioncreated by this urge as the force behind evolution, as well as all humancreativity. Those who give way to the compulsion and become transvestitesrelease the tension, and destroy their potential creativity. Those who strugglewith it may become great artists, or even saints and mystics. One man Charlottehad interviewed claimed to have had an orgasm that lasted for eight hours, andthis, she thought, was because these inner forces were perfectly balanced at avery high level.In due course I met Charlotte – a big lady with huge bosoms and a deep voice –and even interviewed her for a magazine called Time Out, for her ideas werebeginning to attract attention. I also wrote a section about her theories inMysteries.Then, in 1981, Charlotte was found dead in her room, and when she was undressed,proved to be a man. She had died of cancer – afraid to consult a doctor becauseit would betray her secret.I spent the first two chapters of The Misfits discussing her life and ideas,then used them as a springboard to speak of various sexual ‘Outsiders’ from Sadeto Wittgenstein and T. E. Lawrence. I wrote it after writing a short book aboutAleister Crowley, another man whose life was dominated by the sexual illusion.All this still left me feeling that I had not got to the bottom of the problem.But I felt that I had taken an important step in the right direction in SpaceVampires, when I had suggested that sex is somehow an exchange of vitalenergies. Which is why, for a long time, I had planned a sequel that would dealmore comprehensively than anything I had ever written about the sexual impulse.This sequel was to be about the grandson of Olaf Carlsen, the hero of theprevious novel, who realises one day that he has inherited ‘vampirism’ from hisgrandfather. (The latter had been in contact with a female vampire – the premisebeing that, as with blood-drinking vampires, a person who has been ‘bitten’ byan energy-vampire turns into one.)The problem was whether I could afford to write it. My publishers,HarperCollins, had commissioned a second part of Spider World, and I had writtenthe first volume, called The Magician. But I felt that my imagination wasbeginning to flag. The Tower and The Delta had practically written themselves,but this second part was far harder. I felt that I needed a rest – a year,perhaps two years, perhaps longer.That is why I decided to embark on the Space Vampires sequel. But HarperCollinswere not willing to commission it, for they wanted me to finish The Magicianfirst. So there was nothing for it but to write the sequel by increasing myoverdraft, and hoping I could sell it for a reasonable advance. It was a riskyventure, but I had spent most of my life taking risks. So I began the book inJuly 1992, intending it to be roughly the same length as its predecessor.Its hero is understandably shocked by his recognition that he is a vampire –until he discovers that there is a whole colony of them in New York, descendantsof the original space vampires, and that they are in no way dangerous. Theyabsorb vital energy from other living creatures, although never enough to causethem harm.Carlsen soon begins to understand that when a man and woman are involved inlovemaking, they exchange energies by a process not unlike a mutual bloodtransfusion. He becomes convinced that if all human beings could learn thetrick, most of our problems would disappear – wars, murders, suicides, mentalillness. For nearly all negative human activities are due to the frustration ofthis energy-flow. It seems clear to him that if everybody could be converted to‘vampirism’, humanity would have made an advance towards sanity and optimism.And it is at this point that he is horrified to realise that there are stillmany of the old destructive vampires left – those who experience a craving toabsorb someone’s energy to the point of destroying them.What followed was my fullest exploration so far of the sexual illusion. And asCarlsen is taken on an astral journey to the three planets of the Rigel starsystem, I found myself creating alien worlds and their inhabitants in anexplosion of sheer inventiveness. Soon the book was longer than The SpaceVampires, and as it continued to grow, I began to experience doubts. But I clungon, like someone going downhill on a toboggan.I finished it in July 1994, two years to the day after starting it. By then ithad grown to a quarter of a million words, the same as the original SpiderWorld. But my publisher had solved that earlier problem by dividing it into twovolumes. There was no convenient way of dividing Metamorphosis of the Vampireinto two volumes, or even three.The result was that it failed to find a publisher. The remainder of 1994 wasthoroughly depressing as the vast parcel went off again and again, and wasrejected. Both my British and American agents advised me to shorten it, butafter spending two years on it, I was damned if I was willing to cut a singleword.By the autumn of that year, I was lying awake at night, worrying about theoverdraft, and wondering if things were really as bad as they looked. Why did noone seem to share my opinion that it was an important book? Had my judgmentcompletely deserted me?I began to consider selling the house and finding somewhere smaller. Or perhapsmoving to America and trying to find a university post. At least my childrenwere now grown up, and my mother had been dead for three years. But I would hateto have to abandon all my books and records.Then one night, when I had awakened at two in the morning, and was unable to getback to sleep, I found myself asking whether I really believed that we were onthe brink of disaster. Then, as I thought of those black days in my mid-teens,when I had contemplated suicide, and recalled that curious feeling of optimismthat surged up in me as I re-stoppered the cyanide bottle, I suddenly knew thatthis gloom was unnecessary. Provided I kept going and remained optimistic, theproblems would be resolved. And with a curious feeling of confidence and reliefI fell into a peaceful sleep.It was shortly after that, when Metamorphosis of the Vampire was still beingturned down repeatedly, that some earlier plans began to come to fruition. Thiswas a commission for a book about my long-time interest in the age of theSphinx.It had started as long ago as 1979, when I had reviewed a book called Serpent inthe Sky by an American named John Anthony West. It was a study of the ideas of arebel Egyptologist, René Schwaller de Lubicz, who had spent years studying thetemple at Luxor. But Schwaller had also come to the controversial conclusionthat the Great Sphinx of Giza was eroded by water, not by wind-blown sand, ashistorians have always believed. And, since heavy rain is so rare in Egypt, theSphinx could be thousands of years older than anyone had supposed.Moreover, since Egypt is among the most ancient civilisations known to history,this seemed to indicate that there must have been a ‘founder civilisation’ longbefore 2500 BC, the date usually ascribed to the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx.What Schwaller had suggested was that this ‘forerunner’ was Atlantis.This is not as wild as it sounds, for Schwaller pointed out that by 2500 BC,Egypt had already achieved a remarkably high level of culture in science, inmedicine, in mathematics, in architecture and in religion. Surely all this wasnot created in the mere five or six centuries since Egyptian civilisation issupposed to have started?I had already come across the same suggestion in Gurdjieff’s Beelzebub’s Tales –that ancient Egypt was founded by survivors from the destruction of Atlantis,which, according to Plato, had happened about 9600 BC.Now three years earlier, in 1991, the film producer Dino de Laurentiis had askedme to write an outline about Atlantis. My first thought had been to try to makeit more historically realistic than most Atlantis stories, and to base it onSchwaller’s ideas.In November 1991 I was in Tokyo, lecturing at a symposium, and I happened tomention my Atlantis project to my host in the Press Club, Murray Sayle. AndMurray remarked that he had recently seen a paragraph in a Japanese newspaperthat claimed that new evidence had been found to support Schwaller’s view of theage of the Sphinx. Unfortunately, he was unable to lay his hands on it. But aweek later Joy and I were in Melbourne, and I happened to mention the problem tothe editor of the Age, Creighton Burns. The next day he handed me a photostat ofthe item, taken from the Los Angeles Times of a few weeks earlier. This saidthat the Sphinx had been studied by a geologist called Robert Schoch, and thatSchoch had concluded that it could date back to about 7000 BC.This notion had been presented at a meeting of the American Geological Societyin San Diego, California, and although orthodox archaeologists had been hostile,the geologists in general had been surprisingly sympathetic.Back in Cornwall I wrote my film outline and sent it to Dino de Laurentiis; and,typically, heard no more of it. Then I plunged into Metamorphosis of theVampire, and put the Sphinx out of mind.But in 1993 I was reminded of it when, out of the blue, I received a copy of amagazine from John Anthony West containing an article about the Sphinx. Itseemed that West had been behind Robert Schoch’s investigation of the Sphinx twoyears earlier. And he had decided to pursue the matter further. MostEgyptologists accept that the face of the Sphinx is that of the pharaoh Chefren,who built the second pyramid at Giza. This identification was based upon a bustof Chefren that was found under the floor of the Sphinx Temple, which stands infront of the Sphinx. But of course, the face of the Sphinx is badly damaged, sothe resemblance is far from obvious.Now West had decided to call upon the services of an American forensic artistnamed Frank Domingo. It was Domingo’s job to make sketches of criminals fromwitness’s descriptions. West wanted him to go to Egypt, study the face of theSphinx and the bust of Chefren, and state whether they could be the same person.Domingo warned that he might conclude that they were, but West said he waswilling to risk that.So Domingo went to Cairo, and quickly concluded that they were not the sameperson. The chin of the Sphinx was bigger than Chefren’s, and the line from itsear to the corner of its mouth sloped at a different angle.I was interested because a publisher had asked me if I had any ideas for avolume in a series about ‘the occult’, and I told him the Sphinx story. He likedit, and I sketched out an outline of the book, arguing that civilisationprobably dates back thousands of years earlier than we have always believed.It had been complete coincidence that John West had decided to send me hisarticle about Domingo. We had never met, or even corresponded. The coincidencestruck me as propitious. I wrote back mentioning that I would be in New York ina few weeks’ time, and we agreed to meet.This came about on 28 September 1993, when I was in New York with my family.John proved to be a thin, bespectacled man who radiated that terrific vitalityof the enthusiast. Like all genuine enthusiasts he was generous with his ideasand his time; there was none of the paranoia that I have encountered in writerswho think that everybody is out to steal their ideas. He had with him a first‘rough’ videotape of a television programme about the Sphinx, and we watchedthis at the home of the playwright Richard Foreman and his wife Kate. It seemedto us that it established beyond all possible doubt that the Sphinx wasweathered by rain, and that since there had been little rain in Egypt forthousands of years, that meant that the Sphinx must date from some earlier rainyperiod.When, over dinner, we discussed my projected book – which had the provisionaltitle Before the Sphinx – John mentioned that I ought to contact another writer,Graham Hancock, who was just now completing a book on ancient civilisations. Healso mentioned another name, Rand Flem-Ath, who had written an unpublished bookarguing that Atlantis had been situated in Antarctica.This made sense, for the American professor Charles Hapgood had written a bookcalled Earth’s Shifting Crust, in which he produced convincing geologicalarguments that the whole crust of the earth had slipped about two thousand milessouthward around 10000 BC. This could explain why Atlantis – which Platodescribed as being in the mid-Atlantic – was now so far south.Moreover, Hapgood had written a later book called Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings,a study of ancient seafaring maps called portolans (meaning ‘from port toport’), one of which – the famous Piri Re’is map – showed the coast ofAntarctica in the days before it had any ice. So did many other portolans. Thatmeant that the original ancient maps on which the portolans were based must havebeen made around 5000 BC – the last time the coast of Antarctica was free ofice. But a map is no use without some kind of writing, and historians place theinvention of writing (by the Sumerians) around 3500 BC, fifteen centuries later.Besides, other maps studied by Hapgood show most of the interior of Antarcticabefore it was covered with ice. But who would bother to map the interior of acontinent except people who lived there?So, on my return to Cornwall, I lost no time in writing to Graham Hancock andRand Flem-Ath. Both of them let me see their typescripts. And when I readHancock’s – called Fingerprints of the Gods – I was dismayed to realise that hehad virtually pre-empted my own book, producing some highly convincing proofsthat civilisation may date back long before 10000 BC. (For example, he citesevidence that Tiahuanaco, in the Andes, was built around 15000 BC.) But onreflection I decided that there was still plenty for me to say – for example,about the date man first appeared on earth, and about the megaliths.As to Rand Flem-Ath, his notion that Plato’s Atlantis was situated in Antarcticastruck me as highly plausible. He told me that the book was now being consideredby a Canadian publisher, and I told him that if it would help in getting itpublished, I would be happy to write an introduction. He accepted my offer, andthe book was duly published in Canada, then in England.By this time, my own book on the Sphinx had been commissioned by Virgin. Theyhad been delighted that a book called The Serial Killers, which I had writtenwith Don Seaman, had done well – and so, of course, was Don. But I was stillonly halfway through Metamorphosis of the Vampire, so for the time being, Virginwould have to wait.In early September of the following year, 1995, Graham Hancock came to visit mein Cornwall, together with his wife Santha, and John West. Graham struck me ashaving the same kind of drive as John, although less sheer enthusiasm. He andhis family were having a thin time of it. They had spent much of the advance onthe book on visiting the sites described in it, and were now waiting anxiouslyfor its publication the following spring. I took them all out for tea in myLand-Rover, to a little village on the coast called Portloe. When we had orderedtea, I found myself wondering if I had enough money, and asked Graham to lend mefive pounds until we got home. He looked uncomfortable and explained that he didnot have five pounds. Neither did John West. Fortunately, the money I had on mewas enough to cover the bill and the tip.A few months earlier I had reviewed a book called The Orion Mystery by RobertBauval, who had made a striking contribution to the debate. Bauval had noticedthat the rather unsymmetrical arrangement of the three Giza pyramids on theground reflects precisely the arrangement of the three stars of Orion’s Belt inthe sky. Pointing out that the Egyptians regarded their land as a reflection ofthe heavens, Bauval suggested that the three pyramids were constructed by theNile as an image on earth of the Milky Way and the stars of Orion’s Belt.However, the stars of Orion are no longer a true reflection of the pyramids, forprecession of the equinoxes, due to the wobble on the earth’s axis, causes themto twist slightly over the ages. The last time the pyramids exactly reflectedOrion was in 10500 BC, and Bauval went on to make the breathtaking suggestionthat the pyramids were planned – and partly built – at that date.So if Bauval was correct, there was a sophisticated civilisation in 10500 BC. Ilost no time in getting in touch with Bauval, a Belgian engineer who was alsocast in the same mould as John West. But Graham had already been in touch withhim, and the Orion theory played an important part in Fingerprints of the Gods.The latter appeared in April 1995, and became an instant bestseller, solvingGraham’s financial problems at a stroke and making him a millionaire within ayear.As to me, I had begun writing my Sphinx book in December 1994, still strugglingwith a £25,000 overdraft due to the non-acceptance of the vampire sequel.Admittedly, the Russians had published it – but then, the Russians never paid.I had followed this with a book about charlatan messiahs I had been planning forseveral years, and whose latest starting point had been the fiery death of DavidKoresh and his Branch Davidian Sect at Waco in April 1993. This was finishedjust before I began the Sphinx book, and then ran into the same problems as theVampire novel, and was rejected by several publishers. I was keeping afloat byworking on the Japanese version of Murder Casebook, but only just. And out ofsheer cussedness I began to write the messiahs book for the third time.It was one of those years when everything seems to go wrong. For some time I hadbeen experiencing bladder problems, with a need to relieve myself withincreasing frequency. On a business trip to London these had become acute, and Ionce more noticed blood in my urine. I rang Joy and asked her to book me in foran examination at our local hospital, and travelled back the next day. I was, ofcourse, worried that it was cancer – the thought of dying was doublydisagreeable when I thought of leaving my family with a large overdraft. But thehospital visit brought relief. When I woke up from the anaesthetic, the doctortold me that he had discovered two large gallstones, and removed them both. Andafter an uncomfortable day or two with a catheter inside me, I was allowed to gohome. I went back to rewriting the book on messiahs.A Japanese television company wrote to ask me if I would be willing to go to theMiddle East to make a programme ‘In the Footsteps of Lawrence of Arabia’. Joyand I were in New York at the time – I was lecturing at the Open Center – andour son Rowan phoned us to tell us about the letter. They were apparentlyoffering seven million yen. We quickly looked up the exchange rate in the NewYork Times and discovered that this was about £50,000. We told Rowan to emailthe television company and accept immediately. But when I arrived home, andcontacted them to ask if they were sure they were offering seven million yen, Igot an abjectly apologetic reply explaining that they had included one noughttoo many. They were offering 700,000 yen, about £5,000 – a reasonable sum, butnot, as I had been hoping, enough to clear the overdraft. After some discussionthey increased the offer – but not to anything like £50,000. And in June, Joyand I travelled to Jordan and Syria, and I made the programme, and I got theopportunity to see all those places I had read about so often in Seven Pillarsof Wisdom.Back in England, an old friend named Nick Robinson, who ran Robinson Publishing,asked me if I would be interested in writing a series of small paperbacks, onsuch topics as UFOs, spies, ghosts and famous love stories. In fact, I and mychildren – Damon and Rowan – had already written a number of these potboilersfor Nick. Even our daughter, Sally – now in her thirties – decided she wouldlike to try her hand at writing the book on great love affairs. I did a volumeon UFOs, which I dictated on to tape and got my part-time secretary to type up.But the children, being less experienced writers, were much slower, with theconsequence that in October I found that I had their three typescripts to readand edit – one on spies, one on royal scandals, and one on great love affairs.Now editing someone else’s work is, in a sense, more stressful than writing yourown book, for if there is something clumsy about a sentence, the editor has tobrood on it until he can see the best way of smoothing out the lumps. I workedon grimly through three books, determined to get the damn things finished andget back to the Sphinx book, which was behind schedule. The editing bored me,but it had to be done. And on the day I finished the final book – Sally’s volumeon great love affairs – I stood up, and found I could not straighten my back.Like the previous occasion – after Kathie’s visit – this was obviously due tohypertension. I limped upstairs, bent double, and Joy advised me to go and liedown. But I had to take the dogs for a walk, and was sure the problem would goaway once I was out on the cliff.It did not go away. It was as if I had broken some hinge in the middle of myspine, and both legs became so stiff that I had to begin walking with a stick.And to make it worse, I had contracted one of the worst colds of my life, whichdragged on for month after month, and made my chest wheeze so loudly that Icould not sleep at night.In the middle of 1995, I had been approached by a publisher called DorlingKindersley, who produced large, glossy volumes, to ask me if I would beinterested in writing a volume on the sacred sites of the world. I explainedthat I first had to complete a book on the Sphinx, but then would be glad to goahead with the sacred sites book. I made a trip to London to meet the team, andthey proved to be young, enthusiastic and friendly. And when December came, andI had still not finished the Sphinx book, I began working on the sacred sitesfor two days a week, and the Sphinx for the rest of the week. It was fortunatethat the panic attacks had taught me to control anxiety when overworking.I was a month late with the Sphinx book, for I thought I had until the end ofDecember 1995, but my contract specified delivery by 5 December – publicationday was 12 May. I sent them all but the last chapter, then went on working onthe two books at once. I finished the Sphinx book on 31 December, and sent offthe final chapter the following day. Virgin had told me they wanted to call itFrom Atlantis to the Sphinx. I was not overjoyed at the title, but had to agreethat it was probably more explanatory than Before the Sphinx.In early May I had been invited to Glasgow to lecture to the Scottish Societyfor Psychical Research, at the invitation of an old friend, Archie Roy, who hadbeen Scotland’s Astronomer Royal. The train journey from Cornwall was immenselylong – from 8.15 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon. The following day,which was free, we decided to go to Edinburgh, to meet Graham Hancock’s uncle,Jim Macaulay. He took us to lunch at his golf club, then drove us to a placecalled Rosslyn Chapel, of which neither of us had heard. Rosslyn had apparentlybeen built by a Templar named William St Clair, in the mid-fifteenth century.What was odd about the place, Jim told us, was that its walls were covered withsculptures of vegetation – implying paganism – and that these included corncobsand aloes cactus, both exclusively American vegetables. The strange thing wasthat it was decorated nearly half a century before Columbus discovered America.And this could only mean one thing: that someone else had sailed to Americabefore Columbus.The Knights Templar were one of the most powerful and wealthy orders of medievalchivalry. But their wealth was coveted by Philip the Fair of France, who orderedtheir arrest in 1307. A few days before this mass arrest, someone must havetipped off the Templar fleet in Le Havre: it sailed away and simply vanished.Some ships are believed to have found their way to Scotland, but the evidence ofthe corncobs and the aloes seems to indicate that others reached America.It was a fascinating afternoon, and the trip to Rosslyn was serendipitous, forthe visit would provide information for future work. While at Rosslyn, we saw acopy of a newly published book called The Hiram Key, by Robert Lomas andChristopher Knight, and I bought a copy for Joy. This would also provideimportant material for my next book.We arrived back in Glasgow in time for a glass of wine with Archie Roy before mylecture. And there I received some cheering information. Archie had tried toorder more copies of From Atlantis to the Sphinx, but was told that it was nowreprinting. It had already sold out its first impression.It went on to sell a great many copies – not as many as Graham’s Fingerprints ofthe Gods, but enough to clear our overdraft.After one of the most disastrous years of my life, it looked as if things hadstarted to look up at last. In September 1996 I was invited to lecture at a symposium on ‘Ancient Knowledge’at the University of Delaware. It was sponsored by the Society for ScientificExploration, and speakers would include Graham Hancock, Robert Bauval, RobertSchoch, Rand Flem-Ath and Paul Devereux. It proved to be a pleasant trip, sinceAtlantis to the Sphinx was still selling well, and we felt we could relax andenjoy ourselves.I was delighted to see Rand Flem-Ath there, for it was the first time we had met– and also the first time he had delivered a lecture in public. Rand was abalding, squarely-built, bearded man, and I took an immense liking to him fromthe first. I thought his lecture, in which he set out to prove that Atlantis wasthe continent of Antarctica, was admirable. From the beginning I felt greataffection for him, as if he were a younger brother.At the same conference I met a charming Dutch television producer named RoelOostra, who told me he would like to make a programme based on Atlantis to theSphinx, and asked me if I would be willing to travel to Egypt, Mexico and SouthAmerica to film it. I said I would be delighted – provided I could take Joy withme.Making the programme would also involve a trip to Los Angeles and Washington –Los Angeles to film the famous ‘tar trap of La Brea’, and Washington to go tothe Library of Congress and film the room where Charles Hapgood had firstexamined the ‘maps of the ancient sea kings’. Since this part of the trip wouldonly occupy a long weekend, there was no point in Joy coming. So on 22 NovemberI flew from Heathrow to Los Angeles, a twelve-hour flight.I had the following morning free – we were due to do a camera rehearsal at theGeorge C. Page Museum in the afternoon. And since Roel intended to go and seesomeone in Santa Monica, I took the opportunity to beg a lift: I wanted to goand see my old friend John Wright, for whom I had lectured on my last trip toLos Angeles.In fact, John’s bookshop was no longer situated at the same address. But as Istrolled along Santa Monica Boulevard, I stopped outside a bookshop that wasstill closed, and saw John behind the counter. He welcomed me in and gave me acoffee. I felt that finding him like this, by pure chance, was a good sign.And indeed it was, for John’s shop contained a large selection of books onflying saucers, and Virgin had just asked me if I would write a book calledAlien Dawn that would survey the history of UFOs.It was not, to be honest, a subject in which I was deeply interested, eventhough I had written a short paperback about it in the previous year. I wassimply not much interested in flying saucers. However, with John’s guidance, Itook the opportunity to select a couple of dozen books about them, and asked himto parcel them back to Cornwall.In the Library of Congress I had the unexpected pleasure of seeing Rand again,and we filmed the section of the programme about Hapgood. There was somethingvery decent and reassuring about this squarely built, bullet-headed man, and asI said goodbye, I felt an odd sadness at the thought that I would probably neversee him again.In December 1996 it was time to make the second leg of the Atlantis programme,in Mexico. The aim would be to try to show that, at some time in the legendarypast, white men had come from the east, led by a blond, blue-eyed Caucasianknown as Viracocha or Quetzalcoatl, who had brought civilisation to Mexico andSouth America. The implication, of course, was that these white men were thesurvivors of the Atlantis catastrophe, and that others fled to Egypt.This time Joy came with me; we flew from Gatwick to Mexico City. There Roel metus, and we spent two days filming at Teotihuacan, the sacred site that had oncebeen as big as ancient Rome. There I had a hair-raising journey down a long, lowtunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun, not a place for anyone who suffersfrom claustrophobia, and filmed in a tiny chamber whose purpose is unknown.The next day we went on the Tollan, and filmed among its great stone figuresknown as Atlantides, probably named after Atlantis. Then to Oaxaca, associatedwith D. H. Lawrence and Malcolm Lowry, and its sacred hill called Monte Alban,where there are stelae that show the castrated corpses of white men – quiteclearly not Indians. After that, to Puebla, site of the greatest of allpyramids, Cholula, now merely a heap of rubble. Finally to Villahermosa, to filmthose huge stone heads that look unmistakeably negroid.Ten days after leaving home, we were back in Cornwall, where the parcel of booksfrom John Wright was awaiting me.The next stage of our journey, the following January, was to Egypt, which I hadnever seen. Standing in front of the Great Pyramid, I was struck forcibly by theproblem of how it was constructed. It consists of two and a half million blocks,mostly weighing about six tons each. It would not be difficult to build thefirst half dozen courses, using levers and muscle power. But how would they havegone on raising these blocks as the pyramid got higher? Some kind of ramp? But aramp to reach 203 courses would have to contain more blocks than the pyramiditself …Like everyone else, I was also fascinated by the King’s Chamber, and the riddleof its great stone sarcophagus. This must have been placed in the chamber as thepyramid was being built, for it is too big to have been taken through thepassageways. But why has it no lid? And why was the ‘burial chamber’ empty whenthe first explorer, the Caliph Al-Mamum, entered it in AD 803?The interior of the pyramid was far too hot. Even so, I had a brief flash of asense of being connected to some knowledge that has been long forgotten.Looking at the walls of the Sphinx enclosure, which surround it on three sides,I could see why Robert Schoch claimed that they were weathered by rain, notwind-blown sand. They consist of parallel strata, like a layer cake, some hard,some soft, and the soft layers cut deep into the rock, because both rain andwind-blown sand would cut more deeply into the soft layers than the hard. Butwind-blown sand would not create those channels running vertically from the top;that had to be rain. So I could see in front of me proof of Schwaller’s beliefthat the Sphinx was far older than dynastic Egypt.Since it seemed pointless to go to Egypt without visiting its ancient capital,Thebes (Luxor), Joy and I flew there, and I had a chance to see the temple inwhich Schwaller de Lubicz spent so many years of his life. We hired a guide totake us around its vast sister temple at Karnak, since it would otherwise havetaken us a whole day. I felt guilty at rushing around these places like atourist; nevertheless, I felt it was important to form an impression of them forfuture work.Two months later, in early March, we embarked on the last – and most impressive– stage of our journey: to Bolivia and Peru. We flew to Buenos Aires, then on toLa Paz, in the Andes. This is 12,000 feet above sea level, and we notedimmediately that the thin air made us tired and slightly dizzy – in spite of atea brewed from coca leaves (the basis of cocaine) provided by the hotel. Roel,unaffected by the altitude, continued to rush around and organise permits; Joyand I decided it would be more sensible to retire to the bar and drinkmargaritas.That night, after I had fallen asleep, Joy woke me up to say she was sufferingfrom heart palpitations. I knew there was an oxygen cylinder available in thelobby, and had to go down and explain my needs in sign language, since I spokeno Spanish. I had morbid visions of having to return to England with Joy in acoffin, but the oxygen mask proved effective, and she got a normal night’ssleep. In spite of which, she decided not to come with us to Tiahuanaco the nextday – since it was another 500 feet above sea level – but to stay in the hotel.This was a pity, for the ruins of Tiahuanaco are extraordinary. The main part ofthe temple is an immense courtyard called the Kalasasiya, which contains thefamous ‘great idol’. Professor Arthur Posnansky, who spent his life studyingTiahuanaco (and wrote the classic book on it), concluded from the astronomicalalignments of the temple that it must have been built in 15000 BC – fivethousand years before the end of Plato’s Atlantis. Scholars were horrified atthat remote date, and a German team checked Posnansky’s measurements withTeutonic thoroughness – and found them accurate. Nevertheless, in the smallmuseum opposite the temple, its date is given as 500 BC.In front of the Kalasasiya there is a sunken temple that I nicknamed ‘theswimming pool’ since that is what it looks like. And in its centre there is astatue of a bearded white man (Indians cannot grow beards), who is supposed tobe the white god Viracocha, who according to legend landed on the east coast ofMexico after tidal waves had signalled some great catastrophe in themid-Atlantic.Equally remarkable is the statue known as ‘the Friar’ (El Fraile) which standsin a remote corner of the great courtyard. It is obviously a fish god, with hugeeyes, and scales on the lower part of its body. I was fascinated because I knewthat the Dogon, a tribe in Mali, East Africa, had declared that civilisation wasoriginally brought to earth by ‘fish gods’ from the star Sirius. And the Dogonknew something that was then unknown to astronomers – that Sirius is a doublestar, which has an invisible companion made of matter far heavier than any onearth. In fact, Sirius’s invisible companion, Sirius B, is a ‘white dwarf’, madeof immensely heavy elements that have collapsed in on themselves.As I looked at ‘the Friar’, I realised that there was a simple link between myarguments in Atlantis to the Sphinx and the projected Alien Dawn. This statueseemed to be evidence that aliens had come to earth in the remote past.But most impressive of all is the port area, known as the ‘puma punka’, or PumaGate. One construction block weighs 440 tons, and we have no idea of how itcould have been moved. The great blocks on the site are joined together by metalclamps that must have been made in a portable forge and poured in while stillmolten. The builders of Tiahuanaco obviously possessed a sophisticatedtechnology.Fortunately, Joy had a chance to see Tiahuanaco after all, for Roel decided toreturn the next day to finish shooting. I persuaded her that if she took half ofone of my blood pressure tablets, it should compensate for the low atmosphericpressure. It worked, and she was able to spend a perfectly comfortable day highup in the mountains.We went on to Cuzco for more filming, including the giant stone walls ofSacsahuaman, as baffling in their way as the Great Pyramid, many of the blockstoo large to be lifted by even the largest modern crane. And finally Joy and Ispent half a day in a rickety train that chugged along mountain valleys andthrough the jungle, to drop us off at the station below Machu Picchu, the hiddenmountain stronghold where the last Inca hid from the Spaniards. As withTiahuanaco, its date is unknown. Scholars assume it is fifteenth century AD, butGraham Hancock quotes the German astronomer Rolf Müller as saying that itsalignments suggest that it could be 6,000 years old.As to why it matters if civilisation is far older than we assume, the answer isthat it doesn’t if the mentality of these remote ancestors was more-or-less thesame as our own. But the more I saw of ancient sites, the more I becameconvinced – as I argued in Atlantis to the Sphinx – that it was fundamentallydifferent from our own way of grasping reality. It amounts to Robert Graves’sdistinction between lunar and solar knowledge: lunar knowledge is more intuitiveand visceral than solar knowledge, and it can, as Graves said, ‘leap straightfrom problem to answer’. And this, I felt fairly certain, was the kind ofknowledge posessed by ancient man. It explains, for example, why, fromNeanderthal onwards, they seemed to have some strange and comprehensiveknowledge of the heavens.Such knowledge explains what I meant in The Occult by the phrase ‘Magic is thescience of the future’. Three days later, we were back in Cornwall, and I was becoming increasinglyexcited about the UFO book. What I had seen in South America convinced me thatthe Dogon could be right, and that the earth has probably been visited in theremote past by beings from other worlds. Of course, Däniken had said the samething in his Chariots of the Gods, but his books were so full of absurdities –and in one case, downright untruths – that I had dismissed him and his ‘ancientastronauts’ out of hand. Now I saw it was a mistake to throw out the baby withthe bathwater.When I settled down to study the pile of books from Los Angeles, I began tograsp the nature of the problem. ‘Flying saucers’ were first reported in 1947,when I was a sixteen-year-old schoolboy. Since my mind was full of gloom aboutthe meaning of human existence, I dismissed them as irrelevant – they were notgoing to answer the question of why I was here on earth.Now I began to see that it is not as simple as that. The problem with UFOs isthat although many reports are deeply convincing because attested by manywitnesses, others have a preposterous element that can only be called‘deliberate unbelievableness’, as if they are designed to create scepticism,like a con man who is trying a double-bluff.One example will suffice: the ‘siege of Hopkinsville’.In the early morning of 21 August 1955, two carloads of frightened peoplearrived at the police station in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and alleged that theyhad been besieged in their remote farm by little shining men, who somersaultedbackwards when struck by bullets, but were otherwise unharmed. Police droveseven miles to Sutton Farm, but could find nothing, and left. Then the littlemen came back and peered in the windows, and the ‘siege’ continued for the restof the night.Neighbours heard the shooting. One of them saw some craft landing nearby. Andtwo carloads of people do not drive seven miles as a joke. Something undoubtedlyhappened at Sutton Farm that night – but what?It was my friend Jacques Vallee, the world’s leading UFO expert, who firstpointed out that there is a fundamental similarity between some reported UFOcases and tales of medieval fairies and goblins. And the more I read of UFOcases, the more I was inclined to agree that there seems to be some curious‘paranormal’ element.And what of the hundreds of cases that began to command attention in themid-1980s, of people who realised that several hours were missing out of theirlives, and then gradually remembered that they had been abducted bystrange-looking grey creatures with large eyes? Again, the simplest explanationis they were suffering from delusions. But this simplistic theory will not work.A friend of mine, Professor John Mack, a Harvard psychologist, had beenapproached by an investigator named Budd Hopkins, and asked if he would lookinto reports of ‘missing time’ by people in the Boston area. His first reactionwas to dismiss it all as absurd, but fair-mindedness led him to look into a fewcases, all involving apparently sane and normal people – students, housewives,secretaries, businessmen, even psychologists – that ended by convincing him thatthey were telling the truth. The result was a book called Abduction that almostcost him his job, since the University of Boston does not like its professorsbeing held up to public ridicule.His ultimate conclusion was certainly alarming to academic colleagues. He speaksof our everyday experience as ‘consensus reality’, and argues that there is noway of making sense of UFO reports ‘within the framework of our existing viewsof what is real or possible’.Since The Outsider was about people who feel that there is something deeplywrong with ‘consensus reality’, and that we need to broaden our views about whatis real or possible, I experienced an instant rapport with his conclusions. Iended by coming to believe that although UFO phenomena seem to contradictconsensus reality, they do not contradict the reality described by quantumphysicists. Or, for that matter, mystics. All the evidence seems to show that weshould not regard UFOs as ‘space craft’, but as unknown energy forms.I ended by agreeing with Jacques Vallee and John Mack: the purpose of UFOphenomena seems to be heuristic – that is, they are designed to teach ussomething, to change our attitude towards reality. H. G. Wells had written anovel called Star Begotten in which he argues that evolution is creating a newtype of human being. He calls these new men ‘Martians’. And at the end of mythree-hundred-page study of the UFO phenomenon, this was in fact my ownconclusion. Something is trying to alter and widen our concept of reality.My conclusion was reinforced by an odd series of events that came about while Iwas writing the book, and which I have touched on earlier. I have a digitalclock beside my bed with illuminated figures. While I was writing Alien Dawn, Ioften glanced at it in the night and found that it was in treble figures – 1.11.2.22. 3.33. 4.44. The chances of this kind of coincidence are obviously one insixty; but during the writing of Alien Dawn it occurred again and again. And onthe day I was due to finish the book, I woke around 4 o’clock, then dozed offagain. Then, as I woke, I thought: I bet you what you like it’s 4.44. I turnedover, and indeed it was 4.44.Once the book was finished, the phenomenon became as rare as it had been before.I concluded that Jung was correct: synchronicity tells us something importantabout the nature of reality. In the case of Alien Dawn, it was trying to tell methat I was on the right track. When Roel Oostra’s programme on Atlantis was broadcast, I emailed Rand to ask ifhe had seen it, and learned that he had not. So I sent him a videotape. Soonafter that, I received an email from him asking me if I might considercollaborating with him on a book about his own latest theories on ancientcivilisation. Naturally, I was immensely interested. And when Rand sent me anoutline of his ideas, I knew immediately that this was a book I would want towrite.The reason he needed a collaborator, Rand explained, was that his wife Rose, whohad co-authored When the Sky Fell, now wanted to be able to devote her full timeto the novel she was writing.I had known that Rand had corresponded with Charles Hapgood, and that Hapgoodhad died after a car accident. But Rand had not told me the full story, and whenI heard it, I instantly felt that this was best-seller material.As already described, Rand had become interested in Atlantis by chance, and hadstarted to research it in 1976. He soon began to speculate whether Atlantismight have been Antarctica. Then he read Hapgood’s Maps of the Ancient Sea Kingsand Earth’s Shifting Crust, and his Antarctic theory was reinforced. If, asHapgood said, the ancient maps proved that there had been a civilisation aroundor even before 7000 BC, this could be Atlantis – although Hapgood, as arespectable academic, did not dare to say as much. Rand sent Hapgood a paperdiscussing his ideas, and Hapgood said that ‘it was the first truly scientificexplanation of my work that has been done’. Rand and Rose decided to move toLondon, where he could do his research in the British Museum.From London Rand wrote to Hapgood, and received an amazing letter. Hapgood toldhim: ‘… in recent exciting discoveries I believe I have convincing evidence of awhole cycle of civilisation in America and in Antarctica, suggesting advancedlevels of science that may go back 100,000 years …’Rand was staggered. A hundred thousand years? That is about fifteen times thepresent estimate of the age of civilisation. He wrote back immediately askingfor further details. His letter was returned labelled ‘Deceased’. Hapgood hadwalked in front of a car, and died in hospital.What on earth could Hapgood have meant about a hundred-thousand-year-oldscience?This was the question Rand wanted me to try and help him answer. He had studiedHapgood’s papers at Yale, and found no hint of an answer; neither couldHapgood’s friends or relatives offer any help.Hapgood’s assertion excited me so much because it reinforced my own convictionthat intelligence did not make its first appearance on earth with the coming ofthe Cro-Magnons, around fifty thousand years ago, but was already present in theform of some deeper power of intuition that, as Graves said, ‘can cut out allroutine processes of thought and leap straight from the problem to the answer’.Rand had already stumbled on an important clue. Running approximately north outof Teotihuacan, in Mexico, there is a two-mile avenue that has become known asthe Way of the Dead. But it is 15.5 degrees off true north. And when Randdiscovered that there were forty-nine other Central American sacred sites thathad the same misalignment, he had a flash of inspiration. Could it be that thesesites were aligned on the old North Pole, before the earth’s crust slipped twothousand miles south?But Hapgood believed this ‘slippage’ occurred between 15000 and 10000 BC. If so,then these temples must have been built long before civilisation came intoexistence in the Middle East.It is true that archaeologists have dated many of these as far more recent thanthat. But that proves nothing, for such sites are often built one on top ofanother. I had learned while writing my own Atlas of Sacred Sites that this istrue of many temples, and we know that no less than nine Troys have beendiscovered in successive layers.So it looked as if Rand had discovered the most convincing proof yet thatcivilisation may be thousands of years older than anyone thought.Rand and I began planning the book immediately. Our first problem was finding apublisher. This was solved for us by Graham Hancock’s agent, Bill Hamilton, whoasked Rand to come to London so we could go and ‘present’ the idea to variouspublishers. I lent Rand the fares across the Atlantic, and we spent a week doingour ‘presentations’. The result was an excellent offer of £110,000 from LittleBrown. We then did our presentations in New York, and this time received anoffer of $75,000 (about £50,000). I lent Rand my part of the initial advance, sohe and Rose could buy a house.However, early in the project, Rand discovered that his theory was not aswatertight as he thought. When the curve in the earth’s surface was taken intoaccount, his sacred sites were not precisely aligned on the old North Pole inHudson Bay. But he had made an equally important discovery: that sacred sitesare placed symmetrically on the earth’s surface, as if in a grid pattern. I wasdeeply impressed when his theory led him to locate a place that ought to be asacred site in British Honduras, and where indeed there proved to be a Mayatemple – at a place called Lubantuun, where the famous ‘crystal skull’ isalleged to have been discovered.Next I needed to do some ‘field work’. The ideal opportunity arose in November1998, when I was invited on a trip down the Nile, together with other writerswho were interested in ancient civilisations: John West, Robert Bauval, RobertTemple, Michael Baigent, and others. We had all agreed to give lectures on theboat.The cabin next door to ours was occupied by a couple named Walton – Gurth andMaria. And after I had given my lecture, they asked me if I knew a book calledOur Cosmic Ancestors by Maurice Chatelain, and lent me their copy. Chatelain wasan aeronautics engineer who had worked on the Apollo moon project.Chatelain explains that when European nineteenth-century archaeologists hadexcavated the ruins of Nineveh, in what was then Mesopotamia, they discoveredtablets inscribed with huge numbers, one of them containing fifteen digits:195,955,200,000,000. No one could imagine what the ancient Assyrians wanted withsuch vast numbers. Then Chatelain had an idea. The ancestors of the Assyrianswere the Sumerians, and the Sumerians had invented seconds, minutes and hours.Could this enormous number be in seconds? He worked it out to 2,268 milliondays, or just over six million years.He now recalled the precession of the equinoxes, that slight wobble on theearth’s axis that takes just under 26,000 years to complete its cycle. And whenChatelain tried dividing the fifteen-digit ‘Nineveh number’ by the length of theprecessional cycle, he knew he was on the right track, for it divided exactly240 times.He wondered if the Nineveh number could be what ancient astronomers had called‘the great constant of the solar system’, a number that would be a multiple ofthe revolution of each and every body in the solar system, including moons. Hetried it and again it worked.So these ancient astronomers must have had an awe-inspiring understanding of thesolar system – far, far greater than anyone suspected. They knew as much aboutthe heavens as Isaac Newton did, and probably more.The Nineveh number provided such accurate estimates of the revolution of theheavenly bodies that Chatelain was puzzled when he found a very slightdiscrepancy when he compared the earth’s revolution according to the Ninevehnumber to its length as measured by a modern caesium clock. It was only atwelve-millionth of a second per year, but the Nineveh number had been otherwiseso accurate that he felt there must be some explanation.Then he remembered something. The earth is slowing down very slowly – a meresixteen millionths of a second per year. This could explain the tiny inaccuracy.But if he took it into account, the implications were staggering. The Ninevehnumber would have been totally accurate 65,000 years ago. What this implied isthat there were men on earth that long ago who computed the Nineveh number. Itlooks as if Hapgood could be right when he suggested ‘advanced levels of sciencethat could go back 100,000 years’.But if so, what could it mean? What intelligent beings were there on earth65,000 years ago? Chatelain was convinced they were visitors from space, and Iwas certainly not willing to rule out that possibility, in view of that statueof ‘the Friar’ in Tiahuanaco.Now in a book called Hamlet’s Mill, Georgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechendhad demonstrated very convincingly that most ancient cultures knew all about theprecession of the equinoxes.This did not surprise me, for I had always been fascinated by the ability ofmathematical prodigies. In the nineteenth-century a five-year-old boy namedBenjamin Blyth was out walking with his father, and asked him what time it was.His father told him. A few minutes later, Benjamin said: ‘In that case I havebeen alive …’ – and he named the number of seconds, about 158 million. Later,back at home, his father did the calculation on paper and said: ‘You were wrongby 178,000 seconds.’ ‘No I wasn’t,’ said the child, ‘You’ve forgotten the twoleap years.’So it is perfectly conceivable that our ancestors might have been able to handleimmense figures in the same way. It is probably a natural ‘right brain’ ability.This also seems to rule out Daniken’s belief that ‘ancient astronauts’ createdour civilisation. For surely the space men would have explained to human beingsthat the precession of the equinoxes, to which they attached such immensemystical significance – assuming it to be a glimpse into the mind of the gods –was merely due to a wobble on the earth’s axis. But then, this is no ultimateargument against ‘ancient astronauts’ – only against the belief that theycreated civilisation.It should be noted that Hapgood did not say that advanced levels of civilisationexisted 100,000 years ago, but advanced levels of science. And that wouldcertainly apply to the Nineveh number.Now a psychologist friend of mine named Stan Gooch, had written a book calledCities of Dreams, arguing that Neanderthal man was not a shambling ape, but wasan astronomer who possessed a genuine culture. Was it possible, I wondered, thatHapgood may have had Neanderthal man in mind?This was confirmed one day when I was still writing the early chapters of thebook. I had been contacting Hapgood’s friends, to try to find out if he had toldany of them about the ‘hundred-thousand-year-old science’ – so far, with noresult. Then someone advised me to try a retired academic who lived inMassachusetts – I shall call him Carl (although that is not his name) forreasons that will become apparent. And when I rang him, he took my breath awayby telling me that it was he who had convinced Hapgood that civilisation is tensof thousands of years older than we have assumed.When I asked him why he thought so, he mentioned two reasons. First: that themeasurements of the earth prove that ancient man knew its exact size long beforethe Greeks. Second: that there is evidence that Neanderthal man was far moreintelligent than we give him credit for.The first had been pointed out by a geographer named A. E. Berriman, in his 1953book Historical Metrology. Berriman noted that although the Greeks did not knowthe size of the earth until about 200 BC, when the astronomer Eratosthenesworked it out, the polar circumference of the earth is exactly 216,000 Greekstade (the latter being about the length of a football pitch).Now a stade consists of 600 Greek feet, and if we want to know how many stadethere are in one degree of the earth’s circumference, we divide 216,000 by 360degrees, and the result is 600, the same as the number of feet in a stade. Thatcannot be chance. It can only mean that, centuries before Eratosthenes, someunknown civilisation must have known the exact size of the earth. The Greeksmerely inherited that knowledge through the size of their stade.As to Neanderthal man, I was delighted that Carl seemed to confirm the ideasStan Gooch had put forward in Cities of Dreams.I expected Rand to be delighted that I had stumbled on the solution to thismystery, which answered the main question of our book. To my surprise, he was atfirst dubious, then dismissive. Shortly thereafter, he told me that, afterconducting some investigations into Carl’s background, he had concluded that hewas a fraud.This astounded me. After many long conversations with Carl – he was aninveterate phone talker – I was also dubious about some of his ideas on ancientman. But he knew too much to be a fraud. He was one of the most erudite men Ihad ever encountered.As to the notion that Neanderthal man was far more intelligent than we believe,Rand was totally dismissive. He told me he had mentioned the idea to a femalecolleague and she had burst into screams of laughter.I remained convinced that Hapgood had been speaking about Neanderthal man, andbecame even more so when I found a report from Tarragona University that fifteenNeanderthal furnaces had been unearthed near Barcelona, one of them a blastfurnace. Since then, another report has established that Neanderthal maninvented a kind of superglue, a pitch made from birch heated to 300–400°C, tosecure flint axe blades to wooden handles. So in spite of Rand’s fierceobjections, all this went into the final two chapters of The Atlantis Blueprint.I had also been making some interesting discoveries about Hapgood. While still aprofessor, he had seen a psychologist hypnotising students and ‘regressing’ someof them to ‘previous lives’; Hapgood then learned hypnosis, and was amazed whenhe found he could not only regress students into the past, but get them toprophesy future events with remarkable accuracy. He soon came to the conclusionthat the human mind possesses a far wider range of powers than we recognise. Hewas intrigued by Cleve Backster’s experiments with plants connected to a liedetector, which seem to show that plants can read our minds. His finalconclusion was that primitive man possessed paranormal abilities.This, it seemed to me, was probably an important part of the explanation ofHapgood’s conviction that advanced levels of science existed 100,000 years ago.This is the case I proceeded to argue in the final chapters of AtlantisBlueprint. Rand expressed no objections about these chapters – on the contrary,he sent me a warmly congratulatory email about the chapter on Hapgood’s laterresearches.Finishing a 150,000-word book in a year was not easy, but I finally did it atthe end of December 2000, and sent it to Little Brown. In February, the editedtypescript came back for a final reading. Five months later, in July, the proofarrived.Since I was proof-reading another book, I left the parcel unopened. But when Ifinally looked at the proof, I saw instantly that this was not the book I hadwritten. To begin with, it was much shorter. It did not take long to discoverthat enormous, sweeping cuts had been made, including the whole of its last twochapters.I sent Rand an angry email, asking the reason for what seemed to me anincomprehensible act of treachery. Rand was obviously furious and sent back anemail beginning in capitals, stating that I had libelled him in an outrageousmanner, and telling me that he had submitted all his suggestions to me, down tothe smallest comma. He said that it was my own fault for not bothering to readhis suggestions.So I spent two days, with Joy’s help, reading every email Rand and I hadexchanged in recent months, without success. Finally, I had to write to himasking for the date of the email in question. His reply was ‘June 1st’.I turned to this and found an email entitled ‘last of it’, in which he heaves asigh of relief that the book is finished at last, and tells me that his dogs hadrun away because of fireworks, with many more items of pleasant gossip. He ends‘with affection, Rand’, then goes on to page after page – nine in all – ofdetails of latitudes and longitudes and appendices and notes. And in the midstof all this he comments that he feels the book would be greatly improved with ‘aslight restructuring …’ Then, after outlining these changes in a single longparagraph, he goes back to listing the latitudes and longitudes and notes forthe appendices. Was it surprising that I missed his suggestions?He had also removed all my references to Neanderthal man, and in one placechanged it to ‘people like us’, implying I meant Cro-Magnon man.What made me so indignant was not simply that he had, to my mind, ruined the endof the book by leaving the mystery of the ‘hundred-thousand-year-old science’unanswered, but that he had also suppressed my conviction that a high level ofhuman intelligence had existed long before Cro-Magnon man came on the scene. Andthis was absolutely central to my thesis.In due course, The Atlantis Blueprint was published in its hacked form, with mymost important conclusions excised. I felt it was like an Agatha Christiethriller with the last chapter missing.As to Rand, it was a sad end to a friendship I had regarded as important. Theonly thing that cheered me was the reflection that, since Rand had removed sucha vast amount of the book, he had at least left me plenty of material on whichto base a sequel. Just before I went to London for the publication of Alien Dawn, I had beenproof-reading a book that was about to be published in America: The Books in MyLife, whose title I had borrowed from Henry Miller. It was dedicated to FrankDeMarco, a publisher I had met in New York, and who was to become a closefriend. It was he who offered me the opportunity of writing the long-delayedfourth volume of Spider World.I had met Frank when I had been in New York to lecture at the Open Center. Oneafternoon Joy and I had been invited to a party at the home of the paranormalresearcher Alexander Imich, to meet a group of people interested in the samefield. There I was introduced to a dark-haired, youngish man, who said he hadtravelled from Virginia to meet me. He ran a small New Age publishing housecalled Hampton Roads, and told me that he was deeply interested in the work of aresearcher named Robert Monroe.I had written about Monroe in Mysteries. He was a radio engineer who had beendozing on the settee one Sunday afternoon, his hand resting on the floor, whenhe felt his fingers go through the floorboards. And after that, to his confusionand bewilderment, he found that he could float outside his body and wanderaround the neighbourhood. His book Journeys Out of the Body had become aclassic, and a number of respectable parapsychologists have studied Monroe’scase and accepted he was genuine.Monroe had concluded that his out-of-the-body experiences might have beeninduced by some experiments he had been doing on sleep learning. These involvedplaying synchronised sounds through two headphones at the same time, the aimbeing to establish a perfect balance between the right and left hemispheres ofthe brain so they could absorb knowledge during sleep. He called it his‘hemi-sync’ process. And he later set up an institute to teach people how to usethe hemi-sync process to achieve unusual states of consciousness, includingout-of-the-body experiences.When he took his first course at the Monroe Institute three years earlier,Frank’s aim had not been primarily to achieve out-of-the-body experiences, butto explore the hemi-sync process. And he had found that sinking into states ofdeep calm, using a ‘black room’ and various mind-control techniques, he hadquickly acquired the art of ‘mental projection’.For example, some time earlier, Frank had visited Emerson’s house in Concord,and had instantly felt that he had been there before. Now, using the Monroetechnique, he ‘projected’ himself to Emerson’s house, and instantly felt as ifhe was watching a film with realistic playback. He saw himself – as a certain DrAtwood – arriving at the back door, to be introduced to Mrs Emerson. Theirconversation was interrupted by Thoreau, who was then living in the Emersonhousehold. Later he talked to Emerson, and was convinced that this was actuallya memory of a real conversation rather than some kind of dream or free fantasy.I, of course, have no way of knowing whether Frank’s experiences are fantasy.But having read Monroe’s three books, I am reasonably convinced that he found amethod of projecting himself out of our physical reality and exploring realmsbeyond the body. Of course, shamans of all nationalities have made the sameclaims, and their techniques have been extensively explored and documented bymany researchers, such as Mircea Eliade and Jeremy Narby. A large part of myrecent Atlantis and the Old Ones is devoted to shamanism. But I believe Monroecan claim the credit for being the first westerner who has developed techniquesfor exploring other levels of reality. And if Monroe’s experiences are true, andnot some kind of subjective fantasy, then he must be regarded as one of thegreatest paranormal investigators of the twentieth century, a man who taught usas much about the non-physical realm as Columbus and Vasco da Gama taught usabout our physical globe.What neither Frank nor I knew that day we met was that Robert Monroe had justdied. It was 5 March 1995.When Frank asked me if I had any work he might publish, I mentioned The Books inMy Life, a series of essays that I had written for a Tokyo magazine calledLitteraire. I had just finished proof-reading it when I went to London for thepublication of Alien Dawn.In October 1998 Joy and I flew down to Charlottesville for publication of TheBooks in My Life.Frank was living in a house about thirty miles outside Charlottesville, butwithin only a couple of miles of the Monroe Institute. And on my third day inVirginia, I went to see the Institute.Frank was anxious that I should take one of the ‘Gateway’ courses and learn howto achieve out-of-the-body experiences. My own reaction was a curiousreluctance, feeling perhaps that ‘this was not for me’ – much as I had felt whenI took mescalin.But I spent some time in the ‘black room’, and tried the ‘hemi-sync’ process, inwhich different sounds are played into either ear to synchronise the left andright halves of the brain. This produced a deep sense of peace and relaxationthat brought back memories of the Japanese temples.Back in Cornwall, I reread Journeys Out of the Body, and was again impressed bya feeling of the author’s total honesty. Then I went on to Far Journeys, thenthe third – and strangest – of the series, Ultimate Journey, which I found sofascinating that I read it slowly to make it last.A year after my visit to the Monroe Institute, Frank began to send me chaptersof an autobiography he was writing. This impressed me so much that, in spite ofa heavy work schedule, I printed up every section as he emailed it, and read itimmediately.My interest had been seized by a passage describing the effect of takingmescalin as a student. The drug produced the effect described by Aldous Huxleyin The Doors of Perception: a deepened sense of reality. He writes: ‘If I werelooking at a candle, say, I would really look at it, really see it, for thefirst time in my life.’ Looking at a painting of a boat, it was as if the fronthalf of the boat was sticking out into the room.What really excited me was: ‘The walls, I realised, were alive! Literally. WhatI had been taking for dead matter was something much more exciting: it wassomehow alive in a way I couldn’t fathom, but couldn’t doubt.’I recalled a passage from a book called The States of Consciousness by anAmerican scientist, C. Daly King, a follower of Gurdjieff, who described how hehad been standing on a New Jersey railway platform, practising ‘self awareness’,when ‘Suddenly the entire aspect of the surroundings changed. The wholeatmosphere seemed strangely vitalised … The most extraordinary alteration wasthat of the dun-colored bricks … all at once they appeared to be tremendouslyalive; without manifesting any exterior motion they seemed to be surging almostjoyously inside and gave the impression that in their own degree they wereliving and actively liking it.’It is obvious that what had happened to Frank and to Daly King was that they hadceased to be ‘robotic’; suddenly the ‘real me’ was looking out of their eyes.But then, most of us experience that – when we set out on holiday, or go walkingon a spring morning. Frank and Daly King had somehow achieved an even deeperdegree of freedom from the robot, and were suddenly aware that everything isseething with its own life.Frank also describes how the mescalin made him aware that there is no such thingas chance in human relations: ‘Several times in the course of that long Saturdayafternoon I watched the interaction of five people come to perfectlyorchestrated peaks and lulls. I refer not to anything externally dramatic, butto the temporary clarity of vision that showed me (beyond later doubting) thatmore went on between individuals than their ordinary consciousness realised.Thinking about the orchestration I saw then, I for a while referred to God theGreat Playwright.’This is that odd conviction of meaning we experience when some outrageoussynchronicity occurs, the feeling that our apparently disorganised world is lesschaotic than it looks.In the first chapter of this book I described my experience when driving backthrough the Lake District, and felt as if the hills had become somehowtransparent, and I could see what lay on the other side. This is an example ofwhat I later came to call Faculty X, that sudden sense of the reality of othertimes and places. In this case it was due to the upsurge of optimism I felt as Irealised I had less far to drive than I thought. It is typical of what Maslowmeant by the peak experience, when energy bubbles over like an effervescentdrink poured hurriedly into a glass. According to Maslow, such ‘overflows’ are amatter of chance, and cannot be deliberately induced.But my experience driving back from Sheepwash in the snow proves otherwise. Heresheer concentration caused my mind to go into a kind of lower gear, inducing astrong sense of control. The result was that most of the drive back was asustained peak experience, demonstrating that Maslow was mistaken, and that theycan be induced by effort.What misled Maslow, I suspect, was his failure to add another of his discoveriesto the equation: that students who talked about their peak experiences began tohave peak experiences all the time. Why? Because they induced a mood of optimismthat acted as a springboard. In the case of my drive back from Sheepwash, it wasthe pleasure of finding myself back on the main road that transformedconcentration into the peak experience.It was my subsequent recognition of the seven levels of consciousness thatprovided the final clue: that Level 4 – ‘ordinary consciousness’ – can be easilytransformed into Level 5 – ‘spring morning consciousness’ – by optimism. Andsince I am an optimistic kind of person, I have in recent years found itincreasingly easy to access Level 5. Moreover, since it is a perception ofmeaning – like the view from a hilltop – it is not difficult to maintain.I have also noted that when I am feeling cheerful and optimistic, I often have aclear sense of some presence or presences who are pulling the strings. I see my task as a writer to explore, and at times to create, what Rhea Whitecalls ‘exceptional human experience’. In studies like The Outsider and itssequels I focused on individuals who experienced a deep dissatisfaction withwhat Heidegger calls ‘the triviality of everydayness’. And in works like TheMind Parasites, The Philosopher’s Stone and Spider World, I concentrated ontrying to create my own version of exceptional human experience, and to enablereaders to absorb that experience through the medium of imagination.Until three years ago, one of my major efforts in this direction, Spider World,was unfinished and seemed likely to remain so. Then Frank DeMarco wrote to meand told me that he intended to launch a series of fantasy novels, and asked meif I would like to write one. I replied, asking him if he had read Spider World,and, when he said he had never heard of it (the American edition having beenissued in a cheap paperback), sent him the first three volumes. I was delightedwhen, a few weeks later, he told me that the books had been read by most of hisstaff, and had aroused enthusiasm. So I began writing Volume 4, Shadowland,planned ten years earlier, while Hampton Roads began reissuing hard-covereditions of the first three volumes.I had broken off because the effort of writing the third volume, The Magician,had left my imagination exhausted. Now, to my relief, I discovered that tenyears of lying fallow had allowed it to recover, and I was writing with the sameexcitement as when I began it. It took eighteen months, six months longer than Ihad intended.As I write these words on 3 December 2003, I have just received a parcelcontaining my author’s copies. And that, I feel, is probably as good a place as any to end this autobiography,since it is four o’clock on a winter afternoon, and time to take my dogs for awalk."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUEWittgenstein once said: ‘Whatever is the purpose of human existence, it is notto be happy.’ When I was an adolescent that thought would have depressed me. Nowit seems self-evidently true – not merely in Shaw’s sense: ‘I don’t want to behappy, I want to be alive and active’ – but in the sense that being alive isgrimly hard work, and that this applies to all of us, including kings andmillionaires.When I was thirteen I daydreamed of a marvellous future in which I was rich andfamous and universally admired. When The Outsider came out, it looked as if Ihad made a good start. Since then, it has become clear that the aim was neverrealistic. Moreover, I can see that it was always the wrong goal, and that evenif I had achieved it, I would have remained unhappy, like someone who has eatena large meal and still feels empty. Most of our human aims are so naïve thatthey do not deserve to be fulfilled.Yet I have not fallen into the negative position of believing that all life isan illusion. It seems to me quite clear that certain things can be achieved. Ihave described in this book the experiences that led me to this belief – forexample, that intensification of awareness I reached when driving back fromSheepwash through the snow. In these cases I somehow pumped consciousness up toa higher level of pressure, and could immediately see that this is the real aim.There is another related problem: we spend most of our lives in‘mono-consciousness’, a narrow state in which we are aware mainly of the presentmoment. It could be compared to being in a picture gallery but being forced tostand with your nose within an inch of the canvas. When we set out on holiday wego into duo-consciousness, and our minds are in two places at once: back athome, and in their new surroundings.But then, I also experienced it when The Outsider was accepted, and when we lostand then found Sally in Cheltenham.When I think back on those experiences, I can see that what I had done is to‘close my leaks’, and prevent my mind from drifting like a balloon. But plainly,long and continuous effort is not necessary, as Maslow realised. If we think ofhis housewife watching her family eating breakfast, and then having a peakexperience as the sun came out, we can see that the sunlight simply made her‘focus’, and this closed the leak instantaneously, and catapulted her into thepeak experience.I have a hydraulic car jack which is quite small, but which can lift anenormously heavy weight. I merely have to tighten a screw to trap the airinside, and pump the handle up and down. All that Maslow’s housewife did was togive the screw a half turn, and she went into the peak experience. The glimpseof sunlight made her momentarily ‘unrobotic’, and it was this that induced thepeak experience.It is extremely important to grasp how far we are slaves of the robot. There isa television game in which rapid questions are fired at contestants, who are notallowed to reply yes or no, or to nod or shake their heads. Yet few can controlthis automatic reaction for more than half a minute. It is a remarkabledemonstration of Gurdjieff’s assertion that we are machines.In this book I have not said half as much as I intended to about Gurdjieff. Letme say here that I regard him as by far the greatest teacher of the twentiethcentury. And, as bizarre as this sounds, I suspect that Gurdjieff himself may beaware of this. Sometime in the late 1950s, when I was living in Old Walls, Ireceived a letter from a medium who explained she was passing on to me a messagefrom someone called Gurdjieff – she had no idea who this might be. And themessage, in Gurdjieff’s fractured English, certainly sounded exactly like theMaster. After more than fifty years I can no longer recall exactly what it said,but it was more or less an exhortation to keep on going in the same direction. Iam ashamed to say that the message – in the medium’s handwriting – was lost longago (as later was my correspondence with writers like Aldous Huxley. KarlPopper, Henry Miller and Robert Ardrey), since in those days I had no filingsystem.Goethe once said: ‘Beware of what you wish for in youth, because you will get itin middle age.’ He had noticed this interesting fact that people tend to getthings they want deeply. The great trick is to want the right things.When I look back on my own life, I am aware that I wanted much the same kind ofthing as the nineteenth-century Romantics: enough peace and solitude to be ableto devote myself to what interests me more than all else: the ‘moments ofvision’. Publication of The Outsider made me aware that this ‘success’ was notat all what I wanted. Instead, I found most of my time taken up with otherpeople. It was not until I moved to a cottage in Cornwall that I could finallyconcentrate on my work. Then I had to pay a high price: to have my ideas ignoredor attacked. But it was basically a fair price, for I had once again achievedthe conditions in which I wrote The Outsider, and another dose of ‘success’would have wrecked me. Besides, to have a home and a family was a tremendousbonus.As I move into my seventies, I realise I have developed an unexpectedconviction: that there is something in our minds that can alter our lives – the‘something’ that causes synchronicities, for example. Wells makes Mr Polly say:‘If you don’t like your life you can change it.’ But Wells was speaking ofpractical change, the way we live. I am convinced that there is another way ofchanging our lives: using this curious power of the mind that we hardlyunderstand.When I first read Back to Methuselah, I saw that Shaw is right: the only way tomake human life less stupid and futile is for us to live longer. But how? Shawsaid it would ‘simply happen’ – but I suspect this is not the solution. Whatbecomes clear to me as I get older – and at three score and eleven I havealready passed the biblical limit – is that the only way to live longer is to bedriven by a strong sense of purpose. Human beings die for the same reason theyfall asleep – because they no longer want to make the effort to stay awake.It seems to me that the most important statement in this book is Gurdjieff’scomment that human beings live in the equivalent of outer Siberia. We findourselves in an appallingly harsh environment and, to add to our problems, aredragged down by a gravitational force that makes every step an effort. And whyare we here? Oddly enough, because – I believe – we chose to be. We are likeexplorers on some remote planet, whose only contact with home base is a poor andcrackly radio. Our most dangerous problem is forgetting why we are here andbecoming confused and directionless. Then anything can happen; we become boredor lazy, or even angry at what we feel our undeserved misfortune. Such peoplewaste their lives. And when they get back to home base, and the amnesiavanishes, they will suddenly feel like kicking themselves for their stupidity.And why are we here? In our moments of optimism and enthusiasm, this issomething we know instinctively. The purpose is to colonise this difficult andinhospitable realm of matter and to imbue it with the force of life. T. E.Hulme, the philosopher who was killed in the First World War, said thatconsciousness is trying to force an entry into matter, as the sea might try toforce a small hole in a dyke. ‘In the amoeba, then, you might say that theimpulse has manufactured a very small leak through which free activity could beinserted into the world, and the progress of evolution has been the gradualenlargement of this leak.’ A dog or cat is a bigger leak still. But man is thebiggest leak so far.He has discovered new techniques for enlarging the leak: art, intellect,imagination. And eventually he will be so certain of his purpose that he willnever lose sight of it even for a moment. The grey dawn in which we now livewill be transformed into the clear light of midday, and consciousness will havemade an impregnable bridgehead into the world of matter.Ouspensky and R. H. Ward had the same insight: that this world of matter is notour home. That lies behind us, in another world. But for those with enoughstrength and imagination, it will become our home. And when that happens thepurpose of human existence will have been achieved.My own life has been a whole series of clues to the purpose of human existence.The first was on that journey to Peterborough when I coined the phrase ‘the StNeot margin’, meaning that recognition that our minds can be jarred out ofindifference by a sense of crisis. Since then, the ‘St Neot margin trick’ hasbecome the most useful in my armoury of devices to ‘shake the mind awake’.But the Sheepwash experience and the train journey to Northampton offered me thesecond important clue. The mind can be focused and concentrated into a state ofnon-leakage. But unlike ‘moments of vision’ and flashes of illumination, thisdoes not simply fade away when we relax the mind. Once the state has beenachieved, another simple act of focus immediately restores it. On the drive backfrom Sheepwash I was able to do it again and again. The ‘trick’ had lodged insome kind of physical memory, and could be recalled at will.In fact, even writing about these experiences in this chapter brought them backagain. It brought back a state of ‘duo-consciousness’ which lasted for theremainder of the day, during which I went down to Vault beach for a swim. As Iwas swimming in the sea I saw clearly that duo-consciousness is a ‘trick’ we canmaster.An example of what I mean is the Miss Verity case of 1882, when her fiancé Bearddecided to ‘appear’ to her by an act of will, and succeeded in doing so on twooccasions. Beard said: > Besides exercising my powers of volition very strongly, I put forth an effort> which I cannot find words to describe. I was conscious of a mysterious force> of some sort permeating my body, and had a distinct impression that I was> exercising some force with which I had hitherto been unacquainted, but which I> can now at certain times set in motion at will. [My italics.] John Cowper Powys obviously mastered the same trick, for he was able to tellTheodore Dreiser that he would ‘appear’ to him later that evening, and did so.Is it coincidence that Powys lived to be ninety-three?When driving from Sheepwash in the snow I had a reason for concentrating hard –the danger of landing in the ditch. And as I experienced this ‘force permeatingmy body’, I realised that it is a ‘trick’ that can be learned.And the basis of that trick is a feeling of optimism, the knowledge that,ultimately, it is the mind that controls what happens to us."},{"pageContent":"son [images/00002.jpg]> ME, AGED TWO"},{"pageContent":"father [images/00003.jpg]> MY FATHER, ARTHUR WILSON, 1930"},{"pageContent":"mother [images/00004.jpg]> MY MOTHER, ANETTA WILSON, AGED 17"},{"pageContent":"birthday party [images/00005.jpg]> A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR GRANDAD.
