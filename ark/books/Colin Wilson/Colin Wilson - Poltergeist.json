When Professor Gregory asked mewhere I thought they got their energy and how they used it, I had to admit I hadno idea.I am now in the embarrassing position of having to admit that I now no longeragree with what I wrote there. I suspect I do now know where poltergeists gettheir energy, and even have some ideas about how they use it.

That is why I have dedicated this book to him."},{"pageContent":"Acknowledgments [../Text/Contents.xhtml#acknowledgments-anchor]Many people have provided me with invaluable assistance and information for thisbook.

That was the view I was inclined to acceptwhen I worked for the BBC as presenter of a television series called A Leap inthe Dark in the mid-1970s. It included the well-known Rosenheim case, in which aseries of extraordinary poltergeist disturbances took place in the office of alawyer in Bavaria. Professor Hans Bender of Freiburg went to investigate, andsoon noticed that the disturbances (see the final chapter of this book) onlytook place when a young girl called Anne-Marie was present. She had an unhappyhome life, and he soon concluded that she was the unconscious cause of theexploding light tubes and other irritating problems. This was the view Ipresented on the programme.In 1980, I went with my wife Joy to look into the case of poltergeist hauntingin Pontefract (see chapter 4 of this book), and on the way there met theinvestigator Guy Lyon Playfair. And it was he who staggered me by remarkingcasually that most poltergeists were spirits. I have told in chapter 4 how, whenI arrived at the site of the haunting, I soon came to agree with him. Iexpressed this view in the present book, expecting to be violently attacked byreviewers and scientists, but nobody paid much attention, since I was afreelance writer.But around 1990, I noticed the climate of opinion beginning to change. Some timein the nineties I took part in a television programme hosted by David Frost, anda fellow guest was a German professor of parapsychology (whose name, to myshame, I have forgotten). When sharing a drink with him in the “hospitalityroom” after the programme, I confided to him my view that poltergeists werespirits, expecting him to shrug dismissively; but without batting an eyelid hereplied “But of course!” It seemed that he, and fellow German investigators, hadreached this opinion some time ago.So, I discovered, had another eminent investigator from the Society forPsychical Research, Montague Keen. In 1997, he found himself sharing his housein Totteridge, north London, with no less than two poltergeists.It started in December 2001, a few months after Monty and his new wife Veronicahad moved into a house in Totteridge, north London. When he went into his lockedgarage one day he was met by a strong smell of alcohol and the sight of severalsmashed bottles lying on the concrete floor. Several unbroken bottles were alsolying nearby. For a moment he thought that the wine rack must have torn loosefrom the wall. But it was still firmly fixed. The puzzling thing was that thebroken bottles were five or six feet from the rack. Now he came to think aboutit, he realised some odd things had been going on for some time. The radio intheir bedroom would suddenly turn itself on in the middle of the night. Thekitchen smoke alarm would go off even when the stove was not on. The bathroomwould flood without apparent cause, leaking through the ceiling and damagingwalls below.Veronica, who was mildly psychic, had told Monty she thought something strangewas going on. For weeks, she had been feeling oddly tense. Normally a goodtempered, cheerful person, she had one day startled Monty by exploding at himand telling him she felt trapped. Monty naturally knew several mediums. When twoof them came over one day, they went into meditation, then told him that theproblem was the earth-bound spirit of the previous owner, a Mrs. Joyce, whostrongly disapproved of alcohol. They then established communication with thelady, and when she told them that she felt “trapped,” Veronica realised itexplained her outburst at Monty. Mrs. Joyce must have got inside her head. Aftera two hour conversation, the mediums persuaded Mrs. Joyce it was time leave theKeens alone and move on.That seemed to work; for a while, all was peaceful. Then it started up again.This time the televisions and a tape recorder stopped working, although repairmen could find nothing wrong with them. One morning during breakfast, a bunch ofgrapes rose up in the air off a bowl of fruit and scattered on the floor. Then along crack suddenly appeared on the tiles of the bathroom, the kind of crackthat would have needed a hammer and chisel to make. Something went wrong withthe perfume sprays in Veronica’s bedroom, twisting the plastic tubes inside sothey stopped working.After several weeks, Monty asked their medium friends to come back again. Afterwalking all round the house, they said that it was no longer Mrs. Joyce causingthe trouble, but some male spirit. Then one of them went into a semi-trance, anda cockney voice issued from his mouth. It said its name was Alfie House, andthat he had died about two years before, when he fell into a weed-choked river.He knew he was dead, and had been drawn to their house by a desire to help them.But, he explained, he had found it impossible to attract their attention, andhad finally done this by “making a bloody nuisance of himself.”Once again, the two mediums persuaded him to “move on,” and the problems ceased.A month later, a medium they did not know contacted them to say that someonecalled Alfie wanted to thank them, and that he was now very happy.The next step was obviously to track down Alfie House. But that proved harderthan expected. The Public Registrar had not yet brought their records up to datebeyond 2000. And while Monty was busy pursuing enquiries into police andcoroner’s records, he himself died of a heart attack, leaving the caseincomplete. But at least we know the identity of the two ghosts: the teetotalMrs. Joyce, and the well-meaning Alfie House, who moved into their house becausehe wanted to be helpful, and who ended by getting annoyed because he could notattract their attention.This, or something like it, is probably the story of most poltergeists. They areordinary people who find themselves dead and may or may not know how it cameabout. If they were lucky enough to die surrounded by those they loved, thenthey died happy. There is strong evidence that when most people die, deadrelatives are also present, and show them what to do next and how to “move on”(which seems to be with involved with finding a “tunnel” described in so many“near-death experiences”). But many people do not seem to have that advantage,having died (like Alfie) under less propitious circumstances, and they become“earth-bound spirits,” wandering around until they can find someone who can tellthem what to do next.In cases of large-scale disaster, such as the tsunami that struck Thailand onDecember 26, 2004, and killed three hundred thousand people, the after-effectsamounted to a plague of hauntings that went on for months. It was, in fact, justas things were getting back to normal that the reports of ghosts began: ofhalf-naked people seen wandering among wrecked buildings, and voices calling indistress from empty beaches. One beach guard in Patong, on Phuket Island, quithis job after hearing a woman’s voice crying all night “Help me!” from a badlydamaged and now-deserted hotel. And volunteer body searchers who went toinvestigate sounds of laughter and singing coming out of the darkness found onlyan expanse of bare sand. The aftermath of the disaster demonstrates clearly that“ghosts” are simply dead people who do not know they are dead. Oddly enough,this view would now be endorsed by most Western experts on parapsychology,including members of the Society for Psychical Research and the College ofPsychic Studies.The key to the discovery was an observation made decades ago by an obstetricsurgeon in a London maternity hospital. Her name was Florence Barrett, and shewas the wife of Sir William Barrett, a professor of physics. On the evening ofJanuary 12, 1924, she came home with a strange story to tell. One of herpatients had suffered a heart attack after giving birth, and as Lady Barrettheld her hand, she said: “Don’t let it get dark, it’s getting darker anddarker.” Then she looked across the room and said: “Oh, lovely, lovely!”“What’s lovely?”“Lovely brightness, wonderful beings.” She suddenly exclaimed: “Why, it’sfather. He’s so glad I’m coming.” Then she started with surprise. “There’sVida!”Vida was her younger sister, who had died two weeks earlier, but the patient hadnot been told in case it upset her. She died an hour later, continuing to holdnormal conversation with the people around her bed, but still continuing to seeher dead father and sister, and the “lovely light.”Sir William Barrett, who had been the original founder of the Society forPsychical Research, was so fascinated by the story that he began makingenquiries in hospitals, and soon found that most doctors and nurses could tellsimilar stories about dying patients being met by dead relatives. He went on towrite a book about it called Death Bed Visions.In the 1940s, one of his admirers, Latvian researcher Dr. Karlis Osis, had thesensible idea of sending out a questionnaire to hundreds of doctors and nursesasking for their observations on dying patients. He learned that a hugepercentage saw dead relatives. Dying children often saw angels, and were puzzledto discover that they had no wings.A Norwegian researcher, Erlendur Haraldsson, went to India to find out whetherpeople from a different culture would have the same kind of death bed visions.The answer was yes, there was a remarkable similiarity between the visions ofIndians and Americans. And in the 1960s, Professor Douglas Dean continued thisresearch, and discovered that people of all religions—Moslems, Jews, Buddhists,even Aborigines—have the same experiences.In other words, it seemed that a vast percentage of people who die quietly intheir beds are “guided” from this world to “the next”—whatever that is—by peoplethey have loved and who have preceded them. But for people who die violently, orunder strange circumstances (like Alfie), it seems things can be more difficult,and in their confusion, they become “earth bound,” unaware of where to go next.The classic book on the subject was by a Chicago doctor named Carl Wickland. Itis called Thirty Years Among the Dead. He begins by explaining how, when he wasa medical student, he married a nurse who was psychic. And one day when he cameback home after dissecting a corpse, he found his wife feeling dizzy. Suddenly,a masculine voice spoke from her mouth: “Why are you cutting my leg?” And sinceWickland had just been dissecting the cadaver’s leg, he realised that the voicemust belong to its owner. What had happened, Wickland realised, was that theghost had followed him back from the hospital. And because he had died suddenly,he had no idea he was dead. It took a lot of argument to persuade the ghostthat, since his body was now in the dissecting room, he must really be dead, andto send him off in search of some kind of light that would show him the way.This light seemed to be a kind of portal between this world and the next, andWickland came to realise that in the confusion of sudden death, it is easy tomiss. So the dead person goes on living in a kind of bad dream from which it isimpossible to wake up. He has to be encouraged to see the portal.Wickland’s discoveries caused a revolution among psychical investigators, andled to the formation of dozens of “rescue” circles. These all used the samemethods as Carl Wickland: that is, they talked to “earth-bound spirits” via amedium, and tried to convince them they were dead. Sometimes, spirits who hadalready been rescued joined in and became helpers. Even so, “spirit rescue” wasslow work. A rescue circle might devote a whole evening to helping just onespirit.Then, in the late 1970s, a young psychic named Terry O’Sullivan began to wonderwhether there was not some quicker and more efficient method. Terry’s greatgrandmother had been a Romany gypsy, who had passed on her powers to herdaughter, who in turn passed them on to Terry. When he went to London in hisearly twenties, he joined a rescue circle in Richmond and spent the next fewyears developing. It was hard and sometimes frightening work. On one occasion,he was attacked by a poltergeist which clung to his back, glued to his powerfulhuman aura like a nail to a magnet, only to let go when they were bothexhausted.On another occasion, standing outside a gallery in Richmond that was exhibitingsome gloomy and depressing pictures, he found himself talking to a disembodiedspirit that realised he could see it, and asked him for help. This man explainedhe had killed several women, and was convinced he was possessed by the Devil.Finally, Terry was able to take him back to the rescue circle and help him findrelease.After reading this story in Terry’s book, I asked him the name of the murderer,and was told it was Jack the Ripper. Since this is a subject I have oftenwritten about, I immediately plied him with questions. But Terry, who does notshare my interest in criminology, had not even bothered to ask him his name.It was towards 1980, Terry said, that he stumbled on the “more efficient method”he had been looking for. The root of the problem of ghosts is that they areliving in a world that seems unreal. Not realising they are dead, they may go onhanging round the same place as when they were alive and be baffled andirritated that other people are now living there people they feel to beintruders. Terry has often been asked to investigate a haunting and found thepuzzled and unhappy spirit of the last tenant, who believes that squatters havemoved in. He then has to explain what has happened, and persuade it to “moveon.” Living in this unreal world, “earth bounds” see no clear distinctionbetween thoughts and objects. And this, Terry realised, could provide him withthe basis of a better method of helping them.The answer to the problem came to him when he was gravely ill and thought he wasdying. He seemed to be at the entrance of a tunnel of light. But as he movedtowards it, he saw his grandfather standing at the other end, and making agesture as if the say no. At the same time, he seemed to hear his grandfathertell him: “Go back. It’s not your time yet.” After that, he began to recover.The experience made him realise that if he could only learn to show theearth-bound spirits the tunnel of light, it would be far easier than simplytalking to them. What he had to do was to try to conjure up his own vision ofthe “tunnel,” then turn himself into a kind of television transmitter to makethe “earth bound” see it too. When that happened, the spirit would plunge intoit like a stranded fish diving into water.Sometimes, when he had to deal with more than one spirit at a time —as an oneoccasion on an American Civil War battlefield that was still full of earth-boundspirits—he would conjure up the image of a staircase extending between the twoworlds. This method proved to be so successful that he now teaches it to all hisstudents.To return to Sir William Barrett: this great investigator never achieved thecelebrity of friends like Conan Doyle and Sir Oliver Lodge. But, for reasons Ishall now explain, all that could be about to change. When he was a youngschoolmaster in Ireland, Barrett went to stay with a friend in County Westmeath,and the two of them began discussing the subject of hypnotism, which was thenwidely discredited—in fact, regarded as almost a joke. Nevertheless, Barrett andhis friend began testing children at the local school and soon found a girl whowas an excellent hypnotic subject. Although sitting with her back to him, shesmiled when he tasted sugar, and pulled a face when he tasted salt. When hepricked himself with a needle she winced, and when he held his hand above theflame of a lamp, she snatched hers away. When he placed a playing card in abook, she was able to hold it against her head, and say that it containedsomething with red spots on it. She even got the number right. (It was the fiveof diamonds.)So Barrett had proved beyond all doubt that human beings possess powers thatscience cannot understand. As a result of his studies of hypnotism, sciencebegan to take it seriously again. But his really great achievement was tosuggest to various distinguished friends that they should form a society tostudy such mysteries as hypnotism, ghosts, and dowsing. The reason was simple:that since the mid-1840s (when Barrett was born), science had been confronted bya new and baffling problem an event that I sometimes like to call “the invasionof the spirit people.” This started on March 31, 1848, in a log-built house inHydesville, New York, when the family of a farmer named John Fox realised theyhad an uninvited guest. The story will be found at the beginning of this book,so I shall not repeat it.The Fox case started a flood of psychic activity, so sudden and widespread thatit might indeed be labelled “the invasion of the spirit people.” All overAmerica, people discovered that if they held hands around a table in the dark,“spirits” would make rapping noises, and even lift the table. The new crazequickly crossed the Atlantic, and soon Queen Victoria and Prince Albert weretrying it at Osborne, and the Tsar of Russia in St. Petersburg. While back inNew York state, a new religion called Spiritualism was launched in 1851, andquickly spread all over the world.Scientists were disgusted and denounced it as a return to mediaevalsuperstition. And when some of their own number, like Sir William Crookes andLord Rayleigh dared to investigate it, they were reviled as traitors to science.A few serious thinkers refused to be shamed into silence. These included WilliamBarrett, who persuaded some of his friends—including the two Cambridgephilosophers Henry Sidgwick and Frederic Myers—to join with him in launching a“Society for Psychical Research.” Soon they were joined by eminent Victorianslike Gladstone, Tennyson and Ruskin. Even the author of Alice in Wonderlandjoined the new Society, soon known simply as the SPR, although Lewis Carrollthought the answer might lie in some unknown electrical force. But as hundredsof carefully checked accounts of hauntings poured in, it was soon obvious thathe must be wrong, and that ghosts really existed.Even the humourist Mark Twain joined. Twain had once had a dream in which he sawhis brother in a metal coffin with a red rose on his breast, and a week latersaw him in the same metal coffin with a red rose after he had died in asteamboat explosion. Now he wanted to know if his brother might still be alive.In those early days, most level-headed people treated spirit phenomena as a newfad that would probably go away, exactly as the World War IIgeneration felt about the flying saucer craze that started in the late 1940s.However, it did not go away. Like the UFO phenomenon, it has kept on developingand changing. And today, a few parapsychologists are just beginning to see whereit is all leading to, and finding it awesome. Briefly, it looks as if the“spirit people” are making the most determined effort so far to reduce the gapbetween their “dimension” and ours. Already, they have made some almostunbelievable advances—for example, how many people realise that on January 15,1983, Radio Luxembourg broadcast a live programme in which the voices of thedead spoke through loudspeakers to a studio audience, and answered questions inclear, audible voices?The SPR also spent much of its time investigating people that Myers called“mediums,” who seemed to have a natural talent for seeing “spirits” and talkingto them. Most mediums had “guides,” or people who were already dead, and whocame from cultures that took the existence of spirits for granted; many of thesesaid they had been shamans or priests while they were alive, and seemed quitecomfortable moving freely between two worlds. What was needed, obviously, wassome way of proving beyond all doubt that people survived their deaths. Which iswhy many members of the SPR swore that when they died, they would come back anddemonstrate they were still alive.One of the most determined of these was Frederic Myers, who handed Sir OliverLodge a message in a sealed envelope, with instructions not to open it untilsome medium gave him a message from a spirit who identified himself as Myers.This happened not long after Myers’ death in 1901, when a medium passed on amessage saying that the envelope contained a comment about Plato’s remark thatlove conquers death. Lodge quickly opened the envelope, and was disappointed tofind no reference to Plato, only to a house called Hallstead in the LakeDistrict. Then he remembered that Myers had written a little book about hiscousin Annie, with whom he was in love, and who had lived in Hallstead beforeshe committed suicide by drowning. And the book indeed proved to contain thequotation from Plato.That seemed conclusive, and Myers or the spirit who called himself Myers went onto engage in one of the most complex and ambitious projects in the history ofpsychical research. He, and several dead friends, gave various messages tomediums, none of which made sense on their own, but which had to be fittedtogether like a jigsaw puzzle. The final result of this attempt known as the“Cross Correspondences” is highly impressive, but also highly complicated andrelentlessly highbrow. For example, one set of messages referred to tombs of twomembers of the Medici family in the church of San Lorenzo, in Florence, whichMyers knew well, and to the Michelangelo sculptures on them. There are obscurebits of Medici family history, all communicated through half a dozen mediums whodid not even know one another, and the messages included bits in Greek, Latin,and Italian. As a proof of life after death it is overwhelming, but (it must beadmitted) far too elaborate to convince anybody who does not have time to readthe great fat book about it.In the early days of the SPR, it was quickly noticed that some people can see aghost while others in the same room see nothing. Even odder, some people canboth see and hear a ghost, while others can only see it. It is as if people“tune in” to a ghost just as you would tune in to a television station. Well, ifyour television set has no sound, you call in an engineer. Obviously, what wasneeded in psychical research was an engineer who could understand the problemsof communication between two different dimensions.Such a person—the first of many—finally appeared in 1959. One June day, aSwedish birdwatcher named Friedrich Jurgenson recorded the voice of a chaffinchin his garden, and when he played it back, he was startled to hear his deadmother’s voice calling out his pet name “Friedel.” And soon he was recording thevoices of many dead friends and relatives on tape by leaving the recorderswitched on in an empty room. He labelled this the “electronic voicephenomenon,” or EVP for short. The voices were fragmentary and the messagesbrief, as if the communicators were having problems getting through.Soon after, a Latvian psychologist named Konstantin Raudive read Jurgenson’sbook Voices from Space, and began his own experiments. He and Jurgenson began tocollaborate, and when Raudive wrote a book called Breakthrough, the “electronicvoice phenomenon” became a sensation that was soon discussed all over the world.It looked as if the “spirit people” had were trying out new methods ofcommunication.It was in America that the great breakthrough came. George Meek was abusinessman who had made his fortune from air-conditioning systems. At the ageof forty, he began to find that business success was leaving him oddlyunsatisfied. He fought off severe depression by taking an interest in psychicphenomena. This made him decide that as soon as he was sixty (in 1970), he wouldgive up business and devote himself to studying psychic mysteries. And when heheard about the electronic voice phenomenon, he set up a communication networkof electronic experts all over the worldOne of these was a radio engineer named Bill O’Neil, who was also a giftedhealer. He had been trying to develop a radio device to help deaf mutes to“hear.” And one day as he was tinkering with some unusual wavelengths, he wasalarmed when a vague shape began to appear in a corner of his workshop, and avoice introduced itself as Doctor Nick. The doctor, it seemed, had been anotherradio enthusiast, and soon his shadowy form was appearing regularly and advisingO’Neil about building a radio that would pick up voices of the dead. He was ableto materialise, he explained, by taking advantage of the fact that O’Neil was anatural medium.Soon Bill O’Neil had a second visitor. He felt a hand on his shoulder, andturned to face a distinguished, well-dressed man who introduced himself asGeorge Mueller, a professor who had worked for NASA, and died in 1967. Now, helooked like a normal human being, and told O’Neil he was willing to help himconstruct a radio through which the dead could communicate direct with theliving. He called it Spiricom. O’Neil lost no time in phoning Meek, and Meekchecked Mueller’s credentials and found them genuine. Mueller had been anassociate professor of engineering and mathematics in California.For three years, O’Neil and Professor Mueller worked on their invention. And onSeptember 22, 1980, Mueller’s voice suddenly came out of the radio, and O’Neilrecorded their conversation. At last, a dead person was talking direct to aliving person. George Meek’s dream had finally come true. This breakthrough wasannounced to the world in April 1982 in Washington. A roomful of journalistslistened to the tapes of Mueller and O’Neill, and were told that Meek was notgoing to patent Spiricom, but would allow anyone to build it.In fact, others were already working on a radio for communicating with the dead,and developing their own version of Spiricom. One amazing result was thatincredible broadcast of January 15, 1983, when Radio Luxembourg transmitted aprogramme in which spirit voices talked live on the radio to members of a studioaudience and answered questions. The communication device had been built by aninventor named Otto Knig. True, the result was not exactly brilliant radioentertainment—the spirits obviously felt rather awkward about this newexperience, and made stilted comments like “We hear your voice,” and “Otto Knigmakes wireless with the dead.” But it was all loud and clear, not fragmentaryand half-inaudible, like Raudive’s voices.Ever since that amazing day, scientists have been working on new ways ofconnecting the two worlds electronically. A few days after George Meek’s wifedied in 1990, he received an e-mail from her which, she told him, was beingforwarded with the aid of a group of dead scientists who called themselvesTimestream; it even contained a photograph of her in her new environment alandscape of mountains behind a lake. She told him she missed him and waslooking forward to seeing him again, but emphasised that there was no hurry.Meek died nine years later, aged 89.The next step, according to Timestream communicators, will be an attempt tocreate a television link between the two worlds. There seems to be no reason whynot, since the difference between a radio link and a television link is only oneof complexity. Meanwhile, other extraordinary developments seem to emphasisethat the “invasion of the spirit people” is just getting into its stride. Themost interesting of these harks back to the “Cross Correspondences” of a centuryago.For half a century, Monty Keen—of whom we have already spoken—was one of theleading investigators for the Society for Psychical Research. Perhaps his mostimportant work concerned a small group who held seances in the cellar of afarmhouse at Scole, in Norfolk. They were obtaining some of the most convincingphenomena in the history of psychical research, so convincing that thepossibility of fraud wasvirtually nil.Most seances are held in the dark. At Scole, “spirit lights” would wander roundthe room so everything could be seen. When one of the investigators, ProfessorDavid Fontana, had an irritating cough and was about to take a sip of water, thelight popped into his glass, then drifted out again. When he drank the water,Fontana’s cough went away. The light then went inside his chest, wandered aroundinside him so he could feel it, then emerged through his ribs.Objects often fell from the air—they are known as apports. One was a copy of theDaily Mail for April 1, 1944, with an account of the trial of a medium namedHelen Duncan. It was in pristine condition, as if just off the press, yet whenit was scientifically tested, the paper and ink proved to be of the right age.Rolls of new film, still sealed, were placed in a locked box, then taken outwith photographs impressed on them.Then, just as he had concluded his most convincing and impressive investigation,Monty died of a heart attack. Those who knew him well were pretty sure he wouldsoon be back. And since he had often written about the “Cross Correspondences,”it also seemed likely that he would make contact through more than one medium.They were right. Within days of his death, his wife Veronica and his friendswere being bombarded with messages, all clearly from Monty. One night, Veronicawas reading in bed at two o’clock in the morning when the phone rang. A femaleIrish voice said: “You don’t know me. I’m an Irish medium, and I’ve got yourhusband here. He said it would be all right to ring youbecause you were reading in bed.” She then delivered messages that could havebeen from no one but Monty.One of his most impressive “reappearances” was at a seance with a “physicalmedium” named David Thompson, who is an airport baggage handler. Physicalmediums have so much energy that spirits can use it to materialise in the room.While Thompson sat in a chair in a trance, with a gag in his mouth. Monty Keennot only materialised in the room, so he could touch and shake hands with peoplehe knew, but went on to make a ten-minute speech about what it was like to bedead, and to explain his aims now he was in another world. Then he went acrossthe room to one of his old friends, the psychical researcher Guy Playfair, andafter asking him how he was, patted him on the shoulder.I have listened to the tape made of that session. The voice making the speech isundoubtedly that of Monty Keen. According to Veronica Keen, Monty says he ispart of a group of leading figures in psychical research, such as Conan Doyleand Sir Oliver Lodge, whose aim is to continue the work that began in the 1840sand to establish a bridgehead between the two worlds, so that communication willbecome as easy as picking up a telephone. Curiously enough, another member ofthe group is Thomas Edison, who played a central part in the history of thetelephone, but was pipped at the post by Bell. Edison’s papers reveal that healso tried to build a device for direct communicating with the dead. It is aninteresting thought that he should now be working on a device for connecting twodimensions instead of two continents.Colin WilsonCornwallJanuary 2009"},{"pageContent":"one [../Text/Contents.xhtml#one-anchor]Professor Lombroso InvestigatesAt the age of forty-seven Professor Cesare Lombroso was one of the mostcelebrated scientists in Italy. His book Criminal Man (L’Uomo Delinquente) hadmade him an object of discussion throughout the world. What made it socontroversial was Lombroso’s theory that the criminal is a degenerate“throw-back” to our cave-man forebears—a kind of human ape. According to thisview, a man born with these tendencies can no more help committing crime than aborn cripple can help limping. It gave violent offense to the Catholic Church,which has always felt that “sin” is a matter of choice; but it also upsetpsychologists who liked to feel that man possesses at least an atom of freewill. Lombroso regarded free will as something of a myth. In 1876, when CriminalMan was published, he looked upon himself as a thorough-going materialist.Six years later, his skepticism received a severe setback. He was asked toinvestigate the case of a girl who had developed peculiar powers. In fact, itsounded too silly to be taken seriously. According to her parents, she could seethrough her ear and smell through her chin. When Lombroso went to see her, heexpected to find some absurd deception.She was a tall, thin girl of fourteen, and the trouble had begun when shestarted to menstruate. She began sleep-walking, and developed hystericalblindness. Yet she was still able to see through the tip of her nose, andthrough her left ear. Lombroso tried binding her eyes with a bandage, then tooka letter out of his pocket and held it a few inches away from her nose; she readit as if her eyes were uncovered. To make sure she was not peeping under thebandages, Lombroso held another page near her left ear; again, she read it aloudwithout difficulty. And even without the bandage, she would not have been ableto read a letter held at the side of her head.Next he tried holding a bottle of strong smelling salts under her nose; it didnot make the slightest impression. But when it was held under her chin, shewinced and gasped. He tried substances with only the slightest trace ofodor—substances he could not smell if he held them two inches away from his ownnose. When they were under her chin, she could identify every one of them.If he still had any doubts, they vanished during the next few weeks when hersense of smell suddenly transferred itself to the back of her foot. Ifdisagreeable smells were brought close to her heel, she writhed in agony;pleasant ones made her sigh with delight.This was not all. The girl also developed the power of prediction. She was ableto predict weeks ahead precisely when she would have fits, and exactly how theycould be cured. Lombroso, naturally, did not accept this as genuine prediction,since she might have been inducing the fits—consciously or otherwise—to make herpredictions come true. But she then began to predict things that would happen toother members of the family; and these came about just as she had foretold.In medical journals, Lombroso found many similar cases. One girl who developedhysterical symptoms at puberty could accurately distinguish colors with herhands. An eleven-year-old girl who suffered a back wound was able to hearthrough her elbow. Another pubescent girl could read a book with her stomachwhen her eyes were bandaged. Another hysterical woman developed X-ray eyes, andsaid she could see worms in her intestines—she actually counted them and saidthere were thirty-three; in due course she excreted precisely this number ofworms. A young man suffering from hysteria could read people’s minds, andreproduce drawings and words written on a sheet of paper when his eyes weretightly bandaged.Lombroso may have been a determined materialist; but he was willing to study thefacts. And the facts led him into stranger and stranger regions of speculation.To begin with, he developed a simple and ingenious theory of the humanfaculties, pointing out that seeing, hearing, smelling and feeling all takeplace through the nerves, and that if one of these faculties becomes paralyzedthere is no scientific reason why another should not take over. When he attendeda séance with the famous “medium” Eusapia Palladino, and saw a table floating upinto the air, he simply extended his theory, and argued that there is no reasonwhy “psychological force” should not change into “motor force.” But when hebegan to study other cases of prediction and “second sight,” he had to admitthat it became increasingly difficult to keep the explanations within the boundsof materialistic science. There was the case of a woman who refused to stay in atheater because she suddenly had a conviction that her father was dying; she gothome and found a telegram to that effect. A doctor who suffered from hystericalsymptoms foresaw the great fire of 1894 at the Como Exposition, and persuadedhis family to sell their shares in a fire insurance company which had to meetthe claims; when the fire occurred, his family was glad they took his advice. Awoman whose daughter was playing near a railway line heard a voice telling herthe child was in danger; she fetched her indoors half an hour before a trainjumped the rails and ploughed through the spot where her daughter had beenplaying.Slowly, and with painful reluctance, the skeptical scientist was converted tothe view that the world was a far more complex place than his theories allowed.His colleagues were outraged. His biographer and translator, Hans Kurella, cameto the conclusion that this was all a painful aberration due to the decay of hisfaculties—an argument difficult to sustain, since Lombroso was only forty-sevenwhen he became interested in these matters, and he lived for more than a quarterof a century longer. Kurella can only bring himself to mention “Lombroso’sSpiritualistic Researchers” in a short afterword to his biography, and hiscomments are scathing. Talking about Eusapia Palladino, whose séances he hadattended, he agreed that she was indeed a “miracle”—“a miracle of adroitness,false bonhomie, well-simulated candor, naivete, and artistic command of all thesymptoms of hysterico-epilepsy.” Which may well be true, but still does notexplain how she was able to make a table rise up into the air when Lombroso andother scientists were holding her hands and feet.Lombroso struggled manfully to stay within the bounds of science; he devised allkinds of ingenious instruments for testing mediums during séances. But, littleby little, he found himself sucked into that ambiguous, twilight world of the“paranormal.” Having studied mediums in civilized society, he turned hisattention to tribal witch-doctors and shamans, and found that they could producethe same phenomena. But they always insisted that they did this with the help ofthe “spirit world”—the world of the dead. And the more he looked into this, themore convincing it began to appear. And so, finally, he turned his attention tothe topic that every good scientist dismisses as an old wives’ tale: hauntedhouses. Here again, personal experience soon convinced him of their reality.His most celebrated case concerned a wine shop in the Via Bava in Turin. InNovember 1900, he heard interesting rumors about how a destructive ghost wasmaking life very difficult for the family of the proprietor, a Signor Fumero.Bottles smashed, tables and chairs danced about, kitchen utensils flew acrossthe room. So Lombroso went along to the wine shop, and asked the proprietor ifthere was any truth in the stories. Indeed there was, said Fumero, but thedisturbances had now stopped. Professor Lombroso had visited the house, and theghost had now gone away. “You interest me extremely,” replied Lombroso. “Allowme to introduce myself.” And he presented his card. Fumero looked deeplyembarrassed, and admitted that the story about Lombroso was an invention,intended to discourage the curious. For it seemed that the Italian police hadbeen called in, and that they had witnessed the strange disturbances and toldSignor Fumero that, unless this stopped at once, he would find himself inserious trouble. So Fumero had invented this story of how the famous ProfessorLombroso had visited the house, and the ghost had taken his departure.In fact, the proprietor admitted, the ghost was as active as ever; and if theprofessor would care to see with his own eyes, he only had to step down to thecellar.Down below the house was a deep wine cellar, approached by a flight of stairsand a long passageway. The proprietor led the way. The cellar was in completedarkness; but as they entered there was a noise of smashing glass, and somebottles struck Lombroso’s foot. A lighted candle revealed rows of shelves withbottles of wine. And as Lombroso stood there, three empty bottles began to spinacross the floor, and shattered against the leg of a table that stood in themiddle of the cellar. On the floor, below the shelves, were the remains ofbroken bottles and wine. Lombroso took the candle over to the shelves, andexamined them closely to see if there could be invisible wires to cause themovement. There were none; but as he looked, half a dozen bottles gently rosefrom the shelves, as if someone had lifted them, and exploded on the floor.Finally, as they left the cellar and closed the door behind them, they heard thesmashing of another bottle.The cellar was not the only place in the house where these things occurred.Chairs and plates flew around the kitchen. In the servants’ room, a brassgrinding machine flew across the room so violently that it was flattened out ofshape; Lombroso examined it with amazement. The force to flatten it must havebeen considerable; if it had struck someone’s head, it would surely have killedhim. The odd thing was that the ghost seemed to do no one any harm. On oneoccasion, as the proprietor was bending down in the cellar, a large bottle ofwine had burst beside his head; if it had struck him it would have done him asevere injury. Moreover, the “entity” seemed to have the power to make bottles“explode” without dropping them. They would hear a distinct cracking sound; thena bottle would fly into splinters.Now Lombroso knew enough about hauntings to know that this was not an ordinaryghost. The ordinary ghost stays around in a house for many years, perhaps forcenturies, and manifests itself to many people. But this bottle-smashing ghostwas of the kind that the Germans call a poltergeist—or noisy spirit. Such“hauntings” usually last only a short period—seldom more than six months—andthey often seem to be associated with a “medium”—that is, with some particularperson who “causes” them, in exactly the same way that Eusapia Palladino causeda table to rise into the air.In this case, Lombroso suspected the wife of Signor Fumero, a skinny littlewoman of fifty, who seemed to him to be distinctly neurotic. She admitted thatever since infancy she had been subject to neuralgia, nervous tremors andhallucinations; she had also had an operation to remove her ovaries. Ever sincethe case of the girl who could see with her ear, Lombroso had noticed that thesepeople with peculiar “powers” seemed to be nervously unstable. He thereforeadvised Signor Fumero to try sending his wife for a holiday. She went back toher native town for three days, and during that period, the wine shop wasblessedly quiet—although Signora Fumero suffered from hallucinations while shewas away, believing she could see people who were invisible to everyone else.It looked as if Lombroso had stumbled on the correct solution. But it was not sosimple. On Signora Fumero’s return, all the disturbances began again; so, tomake doubly sure, Lombroso again suggested that she should go home for a fewdays. The poor woman was understandably irritated at being banished from herhome on account of the spirits; and before she left, she cursed them vigorously.That apparently annoyed them, for this time the disturbances went on while shewas away. On the day she left, a pair of her shoes came floating out of herbedroom and down the stairs, and landed at the feet of some customers who weredrinking in the bar. The following day the shoes vanished completely, toreappear under the bed a week later. Worse still, plates and bottles in thekitchen exploded or fell on the floor. But Signor Fumero noticed an interestingfact. It was only the plates and bottles that had been touched by his wife thatsmashed. If another woman set the table—preferably in another place—nothinghappened. It was almost as if the objects she had touched had picked up someform of energy from her . . .So his wife came back from her home town, and the disturbances continued asbefore. A bottle of soda water rose up gently in the bar, floated across theroom as if someone were carrying it, and smashed on the floor.It seemed, then, that Signora Fumero was not to blame; at least, not entirely.So who was? There were only three other suspects. Signor Fumero could bedismissed—he was a “brave old soldier,” and not at all the hysterical type.There was a head waiter, who seemed to be an ordinary, typical Italian. Butthere was also a young waiter—a lad of thirteen, who was unusually tall.Lombroso may have recalled that the girl who could see through her ear was alsounusually tall, and that she had grown about six inches in a year immediatelybefore her problems began. This boy had also reached puberty.Accordingly, he was dismissed, and the “haunting” of number 6 Via Bavaimmediately ceased.As a scientist, Lombroso’s problem was to find an explanation that would coverthe facts. At a fairly early stage, he was convinced that they were facts, andnot delusions. He wrote to a friend in 1891:I am ashamed and sorrowful that with so much obstinacy I have contested thepossibility of the so-called spiritualistic facts. I say the facts, for I aminclined to reject the spiritualistic theory; but the facts exist, and asregards facts I glory in saying that I am their slave.By “spiritualistic theory” he meant belief in life after death. At this stage hewas inclined to believe that he was dealing with some kind of purely mentalforce.I see nothing inadmissible in the supposition that in hysterical and hypnotizedpersons the stimulation of certain centers, which become powerful owing to theparalyzing of all the others, and thus give rise to a transposition andtransmission of psychical forces, may also result in a transformation intoluminous or motor force.He compared it to the action of a magnet in deflecting a compass needle.But ten years later he had come to recognize that this theory failed to cover“the facts.” It might be stretched to cover the case of the wine shoppoltergeist, if the young waiter was an “unconscious” medium, and was using hismagnetic powers without realizing it. But by that time, Lombroso had alsostudied many cases of haunted houses, and he concluded that there are basicallytwo types: those like the Via Bava, in which there is a “medium” (and whichusually last only a few weeks or months), and the more traditional haunting,which may last for centuries. Lombroso apparently never had a chance to studythis second type directly, but he went about collecting evidence from witnesseshe judged reliable. When he heard about Glenlee, a haunted house in Scotland, heasked a friend named Professor Scott Elliott to investigate. Elliott went to seea girl who had lived in the house, and sent Lombroso the following story.Glenlee was owned by a family called Maxwell, and was supposed to be haunted bythe ghost of a lady who had poisoned her husband. A visitor named Mrs. StamfordRaffles was lying in bed beside her husband when she saw in the firelight acloud of mist, which gradually turned into the shape of an old woman. The roombecame icy cold. The old woman seemed to be looking at the clock on themantelpiece. Another visitor, Mrs. Robert Gladstone, had the same experience—butduring the day, with the sun shining; the same cloud of mist, the same old womanlooking at the clock.Since the stories cited by Lombroso are second-hand, and lacking in the kind ofprecise detail that is to be found in that of the wine shop, let me offer here acase of haunting that provides a better comparison. It is to be found in LordHalifax’s Ghost Book.In the 1890s, the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould published in the CornhillMagazine a “true ghost story” about a house in Lille. A Mrs. Pennyman, who hadbeen involved in the case, wrote a long letter in which she corrected theinaccuracies of Baring-Gould’s account. Her own is as follows:In 1865, when she was a girl, Mrs. Pennyman’s family had gone to France so thatthe children could learn French; and they rented a house in Lille, where theyhad a number of introductions. The rent of the house—in the Place du Liond’Or—struck them as remarkably low. When they went to the bank to cash a letterof credit, they found out why. The place was reputed to have a revenant—a ghost.In fact, the girl and her mother had been awakened by footsteps overhead, buthad assumed it was a servant moving about. After the visit to the bank, theyenquired who was sleeping overhead, and were told that it was an empty garret.Their maid soon heard the story of the revenant from the French servants. Ayoung man who was heir to the house had disappeared under mysteriouscircumstances. The story had it that he had been confined in an iron cage in theattic by his uncle, who later killed him. The uncle sold the house, but it hadnever been occupied for long because of the ghost.The family went to look in the garret, and found that there was a cage. It waseight feet high and four feet square, and was attached to the wall. Inside therewas an iron collar on a rusty chain.Ten days later, the maidservant asked if she could change rooms. She and anothermaid slept in a room between the main stairs and the back staircase, and whichtherefore had two doors. They had seen a tall, thin man walking through theroom, and had buried their faces under the bedclothes. The mother told the maidsto move into another bedroom.Soon after this, the girl and her brother went upstairs to fetch something fromtheir mother’s room, and saw “a thin figure in a powdering gown and wearing hairdown the back” going up the stairs in front of them. They thought it was aservant called Hannah, and called after her, “You can’t frighten us.” But whenthey got back to their mother, she told them that Hannah had gone to bed with aheadache; they checked and found her fast asleep. When they described thefigure, the maids said that it was the one which they had seen.Another brother came from the university to stay. He was awakened by a noise,and looked out of the door to see a man on the stairs. He assumed his mother hadsent a servant to see if he had put out his candle, and was angry about it. Hismother told him she had not sent anyone.By now, the family had found themselves another house. Some English friendsnamed Atkyns called a few days before they left, and were interested to hearabout the ghost. Mrs. Atkyns volunteered to sleep in the room with her dog. Thenext morning, Mrs. Atkyns looked tired and distraught. She had also seen the manwandering through the bedroom. The dog seems to have refused to attack it.Just before they left the house, the girl herself saw the ghost. By this timethey were so accustomed to the footsteps that they ignored them; but they kept acandle burning in their room. She woke up to see a tall, thin figure in a longgown, its arm resting on a chest of drawers. She could clearly see the face,which was that of a young man with a melancholy expression. When she lookedagain, he had disappeared. The bedroom door was locked.This was the story as told by Mrs. Pennyman. Lord Halifax sent it to theReverend Baring-Gould, who later sent him a letter he received from a reader ofhis account in the Cornhill Magazine. From this letter, it appeared that thehaunted house had been transformed into a hotel in the 1880s. The reader—alady—described how she and two friends had stayed at the Hotel du Lion d’Or inMay 1887, and it is clear that one of the bedrooms they were given was the roomin which the two servant girls had seen the ghost. The lady herself slept in thenext room, and settled down after dinner to write letters. The hotel was veryquiet—they were apparently the only guests—but toward midnight she heardfootsteps on the landing outside the door. Then one of the ladies in the nextbedroom—which was connected to her own—tapped on the door and asked if she wasall right; she had been awakened by footsteps walking up and down. The twoladies unlocked the door and peered out on to the landing; but there was no onethere, and no sound either. So they went back to bed. As she fell asleep, thelady continued to hear the slow, dragging steps which seemed to come fromoutside her door. They left Lille the next morning, and she thought no moreabout the experience until she read Baring-Gould’s account in the Cornhill andrealized that she had probably heard the ghost of the Place du Lion d’Or.Stories of this type inevitably raise suspicions in the mind of the scientificinvestigator; they sound just a little too dramatic to be true—the young manconfined in an iron cage, and so on. Yet since the foundation of the Society forPsychical Research in 1882, thousands of well-authenticated cases have beenrecorded. Sir Ernest Bennett’s Apparitions and Haunted Houses, for example,contains more than a hundred carefully documented cases, and many of these havethe same suspiciously dramatic air that suggests an active imagination. Casefive will serve as an illustration: a General Barter of County Cork describesseeing the ghost of a certain Lieutenant B. in India—riding on a pony in themoonlight, complete with two Hindu servants. The general said: “Hello, what thedevil do you want?” The ghost came to a halt and looked down at him; and thegeneral noticed that he now had a beard, and that his face was fatter than whenhe knew him some years before. Another officer who had known Lieutenant B.immediately before his death later verified that he had grown a beard and becomestout, and that the pony he was riding had been purchased at Peshawur (where hedied of some sickness) and killed through reckless riding.It certainly sounds a highly unlikely story. Yet it is confirmed (in writing) byan officer to whom the general told it immediately afterwards, by the general’swife, and by a major. The wife also states that they heard a horse galloping atbreakneck speed around their house at night on several occasions, and adds thatthe house was built by Lieutenant B. Finally, Bennett himself confirmed with thewar office that Lieutenant B. had died at Peshawur in January 1854. So althoughonly General Barter saw the ghost, the evidence for the truth of his story seemsstrong. Other ghosts cited by Bennett were witnessed by many people—for example,the ghost of a chimney sweep who died of cancer, and who returned to his cottageevery night for two months, until the whole family (including five children)began to take it for granted.It is worth noting that nearly all ghosts mentioned in the records of theSociety for Psychical Research look like ordinary solid human beings; so itseems probable that most people have at some time seen a ghost without realizingit. The late T. C. Lethbridge has described in his book Ghost and Ghoul how,when he was about to leave a friend’s room at Cambridge in 1922, he saw a man ina top hat come into the room—he presumed it was a college porter who had to givea message. The next day he asked his friend what the porter wanted, and thefriend flatly denied that anyone had come into the room as Lethbridge went out.It then struck Lethbridge that the man had been wearing hunting kit. If he hadnot happened to mention it to his friend, he would never have known that he hadseen a ghost.Now Lombroso, who died in 1909, gradually abandoned his skepticism, and came toaccept the spiritualistic hypothesis that ghosts are, quite simply, spirits ofthe dead, and that the same probably applies to poltergeists, even though thesecan only manifest themselves when there is a “medium” present. The title of hisbook about his researches, which was published posthumously, was AfterDeath—What? (This question would have struck him as regrettably sensationaltwenty years earlier.) In other words, Lombroso made no clear distinctionbetween poltergeists and “apparitions.” But even in 1909, this assumption wouldhave been widely questioned. One of the most obvious things that emerged fromthe thousands of cases recorded by the SPR was that the majority of ghosts donot seem to notice the onlookers. (In this respect, General Barter’s case was anexception. In fact, they behave exactly as if they are a kind of filmprojection. They wander across a room looking anxious—like the ghost of the Liond’Or—as if re-enacting some event from the past. This led a number of eminentinvestigators—among them Sir Oliver Lodge—to suggest that some ghosts, at anyrate, may be no more than a kind of “recording.” In Man and the Universe, Lodgewrites:Occasionally a person appears able to respond to stimuli embedded . . . amongpsycho-physical surroundings in a manner at present ill-understood and almostincredible:—as if strong emotions could be unconsciously recorded in matter [myitalics], so that the deposit shall thereafter affect a sufficiently sensitiveorganism and cause similar emotions to reproduce themselves in thesub-consciousness, in a manner analogous to the customary consciousinterpretation of photographic or phonographic records, and indeed of picturesor music and artistic embodiment generally.Take, for example, a haunted house . . . wherein some one room is the scene of aghostly representation of some long past tragedy. On a psychometric hypothesisthe original tragedy has been literally photographed on its materialsurroundings, nay, even on the ether itself, by reason of the intensity ofemotion felt by those who enacted it; and thenceforth in certain persons anhallucinatory effect is experienced corresponding to such an impression. It isthis theory that is made to account for the feeling one has on entering certainrooms, that there is an alien presence therein, though it is invisible andinaudible to mortal sense . . .But why should this “hallucinatory effect” be produced only on “certainpersons”? Why not everybody? To answer this, we need to understand what Lodgemeant by the “psychometric hypothesis.” Psychometry means the ability to “read”the history of objects by touching them. The word seems to have been coined by aprofessor of medicine called Joseph Rodes Buchanan around the middle of thenineteenth century. In 1842, Buchanan was intrigued when Bishop Leonidas Polk(who would become a civil war general) told him that if he touched brass in thedark, it produced a distinct taste in his mouth. Buchanan tested him and foundthis to be true. Then he tried experimenting with his students at theCincinnati medical school, wrapping various metals and chemicals in brown paperparcels, and asking students to see if they could identify them by holding themin their hands. An amazing number were successful. Buchanan concluded that ournerves give off some kind of “aura”—like an electric field—which can penetratethe brown paper, and somehow convey the taste of the substance to the mouth.What surprised him even more was that “good psychometers” could take a letter inthe hand, and describe the character and the emotions of the person who wroteit. Presumably, then, the character of the writer had somehow been “recorded” onthe letter, and could be “picked up” by a sensitive person.William Denton, a professor of geology at Boston, was interested by Buchanan’saccount of his experiments, and tried repeating them. He used geological sampleswrapped in paper. Once again, the success rate was remarkable. A good“psychometer” sensed a volcanic explosion when handed a piece of Hawaiian lava,vast depths of empty space with stars when handed a meteor fragment, and immensedepths of ice when handed a pebble from a glacier.Now obviously, there is no “powerful emotion” involved when a meteor fliesthrough space or a pebble is frozen in ice. So Denton concluded that all eventsin nature are somehow “recorded,” and that the human mind possesses a facultyfor playing-back the recording—an extra sense that enables us to see into theremote past.Unfortunately for Buchanan and Denton, the birth of “Spiritualism” in the late1840s—when strange rapping noises were heard in the home of the Fox Sisters ofHydesville, New York—made scientists deeply suspicious of anything that seemedconnected with this new craze. So instead of being taken seriously, psychometryand its theories were dismissed as a delusion. But Lodge and other psychicalresearchers revived the idea to explain haunted houses.Half a century after Lodge, T. C. Lethbridge—who was Keeper of Anglo-SaxonAntiquities at Cambridge—stumbled on the “psychometric” theory as a result ofhis own observations. When he saw the “ghost” of the man in a hunting kit, hewas at first inclined to wonder whether it had been purely a mental picture,perhaps “picked up” from somebody else’s mind. Perhaps the huntsman had been aformer occupant of the rooms, and was sitting in his armchair at home sipping awhisky as he thought about the good old days at Cambridge; and perhaps somehowthe image had got itself transferred into Lethbridge’s mind . . .But other experiences led him to revise this notion. One day, after he hadretired to Devon, Lethbridge and his wife Mina went to collect seaweed fromLadram beach. It was a dull, damp day, and as they walked on to the beach near astream that ran down the cliff, both suddenly experienced a profound depression.Lethbridge noticed that this vanished as soon as he stepped a few feet away fromthe stream. His wife, Mina, went to the cliff top to make a sketch, and suddenlyhad the odd feeling that someone was urging her to jump. (Again, Lethbridge wasinclined to think that she could have been picking up someone’s thoughts—perhaps someone had stood on that spot, contemplating suicide, then had a changeof mind and gone home—but later investigation revealed that a man had committedsuicide from exactly that spot.)Thinking about it all later, Lethbridge reflected that dampness can cause radiotransmitters to short-circuit. Could it have been the dampness on the beach thatwas somehow responsible for the feeling of depression? He had also been struckby the fact that it seemed to end so abruptly, as if it formed a kind ofinvisible wall. He had noticed the same kind of thing around the cottage of anold woman reputed to be a witch—who had died under circumstances suggestingmurder. There was the same “nasty feeling” around the place just after herdeath, and he had noticed that he could step in and out of it, as if it endedquite sharply. Could it, Lethbridge wondered, be some kind of “field,” like thefield that surrounds a magnet?Lethbridge was also an excellent dowser, and it struck him that the “nastyfeeling” on the beach (he used the term “ghoul” to describe it) had been aroundthe stream. This led him to the theory that the “field” of water can “taperecord” strong emotions, and that people who can dowse are probably able to“pick up” these recordings. In short, a water-diviner would be far more likelyto see a ghost than most people.This, then, was Lethbridge’s theory about “ghosts” and “ghouls,” which hedeveloped in a number of books written in the last ten years of his life (hedied in 1972). It is a natural and logical extension of Buchanan’s “psychometry”and of Lodge’s theory about “recordings.” But Lethbridge has also placed it on amore scientific basis by suggesting that what does the “recording” is some kindof magnetic field associated with water. The principle sounds very much likethat of a tape recorder, where a magnetic field “imprints” the sounds on aniron-oxide tape. In Lethbridge’s theory, the magnetic field of water recordsemotions and prints them on its surroundings—in the case of the “old witch,” onthe walls of her damp cottage.All this helps to explain why Lombroso’s theory about haunted houses struck manycontemporary researchers as “unscientific.” The “psychometric hypothesis” seemsto explain the majority of hauntings. For example, the ghost of the young man inthe Place du Lion d’Or gave no sign of being aware of the presence of thevarious people who saw him, and that is what you would expect if a ghost is somekind of “film” or recording of a long-past event.As to the poltergeist, the “mischievous spirit” theory found little acceptanceamong investigators, even in the earliest days of psychical research. The reasonwas simply that a scientific investigator prefers natural explanations. Andwhere poltergeists were concerned, there were a number of plausible ones.Eusapia Palladino could cause tables to rise into the air. The famous Victorianmedium Daniel Dunglas Home frequently caused heavy objects of furniture to floatright up to the ceiling, while he himself floated out of third-story windows andcame back by the window on the other side of the room. Home and Palladinoclaimed that their powers came from spirits; but they might have been deceivingthemselves. One of the first thing that struck the early scientificinvestigators of poltergeists is that there usually seemed to be a disturbedadolescent in the house— usually a girl. Lombroso himself had noticed how oftenteenage girls seemed to be involved in his paranormal cases—like the girl whocould see with her ear. And his original “nervous force” theory struck mostinvestigators as far more plausible than his later belief in mischievousspirits.This younger generation of investigators had another reason for dismissing thespirit theory. By 1909, Freud had made most psychologists aware that theunconscious mind is a far more powerful force than Lombroso had recognized.Lombroso has a section on the unconscious in After Death—What?, and it revealsthat he thought of it as little more than another name for absent-mindedness orpoetic inspiration. Freud had made people aware that the unconscious is a kindof ocean, full of dangerous currents and strange monsters. Moreover, Freudemphasized that the most powerful of these unconscious forces is the sex drive.Could it be coincidence that most poltergeist cases involve adolescents at theage of puberty?This, of course, still fails to explain how the unconscious mind of a disturbedadolescent can make bottles fly through the air. But again, science had someplausible theories. In Basle, a university student named Carl Jung was intriguedby a female cousin who began to go into trances at the age of puberty, and spokewith strange voices. And at about the time this started, the dining-room tablesuddenly split apart with a loud report. There was also a sudden explosion froma sideboard, and when they looked inside, they found that a bread knife hadshattered into several pieces. Jung suspected that his cousin’s “illness” wasresponsible for these events, and he coined the term “exteriorizationphenomenon” to explain them—meaning more-or-less what Lombroso meant by “nerveforce.” Jung had no doubt that it was caused by the unconscious mind, and apersonal experience confirmed him in this view. One day he was arguing withFreud about “exteriorization” and Freud was highly skeptical. Jung’s risingirritation caused a burning sensation in his chest “as if my diaphragm wasbecoming red hot!” Suddenly, there was a loud explosion in the bookcase.“There,” said Jung, “that was an exteriorization phenomenon.” “Bosh,” saidFreud, to which Jung replied: “It is not bosh, and to prove it, there will beanother explosion in a moment.” And a second explosion occurred. Jung had nodoubt that he had somehow caused the explosions by getting angry.Most modern investigators of poltergeist phenomena would agree with Jung. One ofthe rare exceptions was the late Harry Price, who wrote in Poltergeist OverEngland: “My own view is that they are invisible, intangible, malicious andnoisy entities . . .” He adds: “Poltergeists are able, by laws yet unknown toour physicists, to extract energy from living persons, often from the young, andusually from girl adolescents, especially if they suffer from some mentaldisorder.” Unfortunately, Price’s reputation has declined steadily since hisdeath in 1948, with accusations of lying, cheating, publicity seeking, andfraud; so most psychical researchers would dismiss his views on poltergeists asa deliberate attempt at sensationalism. Besides, Price himself admitted thatpoltergeists seem to be connected with sexual energies; and he described how thehusband of the Austrian medium Frieda Weisl told him that, during their earlymarried life, ornaments jumped off the mantel shelf when she had a sexualorgasm. This certainly sounds like Jung’s “exteriorization phenomenon.”We may say, then, that the modern consensus of opinion is that a poltergeist isa person, not a spirit. The view is summed up by Richard Cavendish:[1]Because poltergeist incidents usually occur in close proximity to a livingperson, parapsychologists tend to regard them as instances of psychokinesis orPK. Since poltergeist incidents are recurrent and arise unexpectedly andspontaneously, they are commonly referred to as instances of “recurrentspontaneous psychokinesis” or RSPK. They appear to be unconscious cases of PKsince the person who seems to bring them about is usually unaware of hisinvolvement. Some persons remain convinced that RSPK phenomena are due to theagency of an incorporeal entity, such as the spirit of a deceased person or a“demon” which has attached itself to some living person and which causes theincidents by PK. However, since there is no evidence for such spirits apart fromthe phenomena themselves, most parapsychologists are of the opinion thatpoltergeist phenomena are examples of unconscious PK exercised by the personaround whom they occur.“Psychokinesis” means, of course, “mind over matter.” And it has been widelyaccepted by investigators since the mid-1930s, when Dr. J. B. Rhine, of DukeUniversity, conducted a series of experiments with a gambler who claimed that hecould influence the fall of the dice by concentrating on them. Rhine’sexperiments showed that the gambler was correct; he could, to some extent,influence the dice to make it turn up sixes. Since then, there have beenthousands of similar experiments, and the evidence for PK is regarded asoverwhelming.Yet it has to be admitted that even its “star performers”—Nina Kulagina, FeliciaParise, Ingo Swann, Uri Geller—cannot make objects fly around the room aspoltergeists seem to be able to. The Russian Kulagina first came to theattention of scientists when she was in hospital after a nervous breakdown; herdoctors were fascinated to see that she could reach into her sewing basket andtake out any color of thread she wanted without looking at it. They tested herand found that she could, beyond all doubt, “see” colors with her fingertips.Her healing powers were also remarkable—for example, she could make wounds healup in a very short time simply by holding her hand above them. But it was whenthey tested her for PK that they discovered her outstanding abilities. She couldsit at a table, stare at a small object—like a matchbox or a wineglass—and makeit move without touching it. She told investigators that when her concentration“worked,” she felt a sharp pain in her spine, and her eyesight blurred. Herblood pressure would rise abruptly.But then, Nina Kulagina’s most spectacular feat was to make an apple fall off atable. Ingo Swann, an American, is able to deflect compass needles by PK;Felicia Parise, who was inspired to try “mind over matter” after seeing a filmabout Kulagina, can move small objects like matchsticks and pieces of paper. UriGeller, the world’s best-known “psychic,” can bend spoons by gently rubbing themwith his finger, and snap metal rings by simply holding his hand above them.Now Geller has, in fact, produced certain “poltergeist effects.” In 1976, Ispent some time with Geller in Barcelona, interviewing him for a book Isubsequently wrote about him. A number of objects fell out of the air when I waswith him, and these seemed to be typical examples of “teleportation.” Anotherfriend, Jesse Lasky, has described to me how, when Uri was having dinner attheir flat, there was a pinging noise like a bullet, and a silver button flewacross the kitchen; it had come out of the bedroom drawer of Jesse’s wife, Pat:Geller was standing by the refrigerator with a bottle of milk in one hand and atin of Coca-Cola in the other when it happened. Another odd feature of thisincident is that the button—if it came from the bedroom drawer—must have somehowtraveled through three walls to reach the kitchen. “Interpenetration of matter”is another curious feature in many poltergeist cases.But then, Geller was not trying to make this happen. As I discovered whengetting to know him, odd events seem to happen when he is around. On the morningI went to meet him, at an office in the West End of London, he asked me, “Do youhave any connection with Spain?” I said that I didn’t. A moment before I walkedinto the office, a Spanish coin had risen out of the ashtray on the desk, andfloated across to the other side of the room, where Geller and a publicrelations officer were standing. I subsequently came to know the PRO well enoughto accept her word that this really took place. When Geller left the Lasky’sflat in central London, he buzzed them from the intercom at the front door andexplained with embarrassment that he had damaged the door. A wrought-iron dragonwhich decorated the center of the door had been twisted—fortunately they wereable to force it back without breaking it. Geller explained that he is neversure when such things will happen, or even whether the razor with which heshaves is likely to buckle inhis hand.In short, it seems that even the most talented practitioners of psychokinesiscannot produce real “poltergeist effects” at will. But this is not necessarily aproof that they themselves are not responsible. For we now come to the oddestpart of this story: the recent discovery that human beings appear to have twodifferent people living inside their heads.In a sense, of course, this discovery was made by Freud, who called it theunconscious. Jung went further, and accepted that the unconscious is a kind ofgreat psychic ocean, to which all living creatures are somehow connected. Yet itwas not until the early 1960s that scientists began to suspect that the twodifferent “selves” live in different parts of the brain.If you could lift off the top of the skull and look at the brain, you would seesomething resembling a walnut, with two wrinkled halves. Joining the halves is abridge of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum. In the 1930s, scientistswondered whether they could prevent epilepsy by severing this bridge—to preventthe “electrical storm” from spreading from one half of the brain to the other.In fact, it seemed to work. And, oddly enough, the severing of the “bridge”seemed to make no real difference to the patient.In the 1950s Roger Sperry of the University of Chicago (and later Cal Tech[2])began studying these “split-brain” patients, and made the interesting discoverythat they had, in effect, turned into two people. For example, one split-brainpatient tried to button up his flies with one hand, while the other hand triedto undo them. Another tried to embrace his wife with one arm, while his otherhand pushed her violently away. In fact, it looked rather as if his consciouslove for his wife was being opposed by an unconscious dislike. The split-brainexperiment had given its unconscious mind the power to control one of his arms.Now this upper part of the brain—the cerebrum or cerebral hemispheres—is ourspecifically human part. It has developed at an incredible pace over the pasthalf million years—so swiftly (in evolutionary terms) that some scientists talkabout the “brain explosion.” And, like the rest of the brain, it seems toconsist of two identical parts, which are a mirror-image of one another. (No one has yet discovered why the brain has these twohalves—the obvious theory is that we have two of everything in case one isdamaged.)In the middle of the nineteenth century, doctors noticed that the two halves ofthe brain seem to have two different functions. A man whose left hemisphere isdamaged finds it hard to express himself in words; yet he can still recognizefaces, appreciate art or enjoy music. A man whose right hemisphere is damagedcan speak perfectly clearly and logically; yet he cannot draw the simplestpatterns or whistle a tune. The left cerebral hemisphere deals with language andlogic; the right deals with recognition and intuition. You could say that theleft is a scientist and the right is an artist.Oddly enough, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body—theleft arm and leg—and vice versa. The same applies to our eyes, though in aslightly more complicated fashion. Each of our eyes is connected to both halvesof the brain, the left side of each eye to the right brain, the right side ofeach eye to the left brain. (We say that the left visual field is connected tothe right brain and vice versa.) If a scientist wishes to investigate the eyesof a split-brain patient, he has to make the patient look to the right or left,or hold the gaze fixed in front, so that different objects can be “shown” to theright or left visual fields. It will simplify matters if we say that the lefteye is connected to the right brain and vice versa.Sperry made his most interesting discovery about the eyes of split-brainpatients. If the patient was shown an apple with his left eye and an orange withhis right, and asked what he had just seen, he would reply “Orange.” Asked towrite with his left hand what he had just seen, he would write “Apple.” Askedwhat he had just written, he wouldreply “Orange.”A patient who was shown a “dirty” picture with the left eye blushed; asked whyshe was blushing she replied, “I don’t know.”It seems, then, that we have two different people living in the two halves ofthe brain, and that the person you call “you” lives in the left. A fewcentimeters away there is another person who is virtually a stranger—yet whoalso believes he is the rightful occupant of the head.Now, at least, we can begin to see a possible reason why the “medium” inpoltergeist cases is quite unaware that he or she is causing the effects. Wehave only to assume that the effects are caused by the person living in theright half of the brain, and we can see that the “you” in the left would beunconscious of what was happening.But this would still leave the question: how does the right brain do it? Infact, is there any evidence whatsoever that the right brain possesses paranormalpowers?And the answer to this is a qualified yes. We can begin with one of the simplestand best authenticated of all “paranormal powers,” water divining. The waterdiviner, or dowser, holds a forked hazel twig (or even a forked rod made fromtwo strips out of a whalebone corset, tied at the end) in both hands, so thereis a certain tension—a certain “springiness”—in the rod. And when they walk overan underground stream or spring, the rod twists either upwards or downwards intheir hands.In fact, dowsers can dowse for almost anything, from oil and minerals to a coinhidden under the carpet. It seems that they merely have to decide what they’relooking for, and the unconscious mind—or the “other self”—does the rest.I have described elsewhere[3] how I discovered, to my own astonishment, that Icould dowse. I was visiting a circle of standing stones called the MerryMaidens, in Cornwall—a circle that probably dates back to the same period asStonehenge. When I held the rod—made of two strips of plastic tied at the end—soas to give it a certain tension, it responded powerfully when I approached thestones. It would twist upward as I came close to the stone, and then dip againas I stepped back or walked past it. What surprised me was that I felt nothing,no tingling in the hands, no sense of expectancy. It seemed to happen asautomatically as the response of a voltmeter in an electric circuit. Since thenI have shown dozens of people how to dowse. It is my own experience that nineout of ten people can dowse, and that all young children can do it. Some adultshave to “tune in”—to learn to allow the mind and muscles to relax—but this canusually be done in a few minutes.Scientific tests have shown that what happens in dowsing is that the musclesconvulse—or tighten—of their own accord. And if the dowser holds a pendulum—madeof a wooden bob on a short length of string—then the pendulum goes into acircular swing over standing stones or underground water—once again, throughsome unconscious action of the muscles.Another experiment performed by Roger Sperry throws an interesting light ondowsing. He tried flashing green or red lights at random into the “blind” eye ofsplit-brain patients (into the left visual field, connected to the rightcerebral hemisphere). The patients were then asked what color had just beenseen. Naturally, they had no idea, and the guesses showed a random score. But ifthey were allowed a second guess, they would always get it right. They mightsay: “Red—oh no, green . . .” The right side of the brain had overheard thewrong guess, and communicated by causing the patient’s muscles to twitch. It wasthe equivalent of a kick under the table.Unable to communicate in any other way, the right brain did it by contractingthe muscles.It seems, therefore a reasonable guess that this is also what happens indowsing. The right brain knows there is water down there, or some peculiarmagnetic force in the standing stones; it communicates this knowledge by causingthe muscles to tense, which makes the rod jerk upwards.Most “psychics” observe that deliberate effort inhibits their powers. Onepsychic, Lois Bourne, has written:One of the greatest barriers to mediumship is the intellect, and the mostserious problem I had to learn in my early psychic career was the suspension ofmy intellect. If, during the practice of extra-sensory perception, I allowedlogic to prevail, and permitted myself to rationalize the impressions Ireceived, and the things I said, I would be hopelessly lost within a conflict.It is necessary that I totally by-pass my conscious mind . . .Similarly, Felicia Parise found that she was at first totally unable to cause“PK effects,” no matter how hard she tried. But one day, when she had receivedan emotional shock—the news that her grandmother was dying—she reached out for asmall plastic bottle and it moved away from her hand. From then on, she had the“trick” of causing PK.All this underlines something that should be quite clear in any case: that in asense, we are all “split-brain patients.” The logical self interferes with thenatural operations of the right brain. This is why the artist has to wait for“inspiration”—for the left brain to relax and allow the right to take over.Mozart was an example of an artist who was born with an unusual harmony betweenthe two halves of his brain, and he commented once that tunes were always“walking into his head”—meaning into his left brain. In most of us, a certainself-mistrust, a tendency to ask questions, sits like a bad-tempered door-keeperbetween the two halves of the brain. When we become subject to increasingtension and worry, this has the effect of increasing the door-keeper’smistrustfulness. He thinks he is performing a useful service in keeping out theimpulses from the “other half.” In fact, he is simply isolating the left-brainself and making it more tense and miserable. Nervous breakdown is due to theincreasingly desperate attempts of this door-keeper to cope with problems inwhat he considers to be the right way, and which is, in fact, the worst possibleway.What Lois Bourne has said about suspending the rational intellect seems to applyto most forms of “extra-sensory perception” and paranormal abilities. Mostpeople have had the experience of reaching out to pick up the telephone andknowing who is on the other end. Everyone has had the experience of thinkingabout someone they haven’t heard from in years, and receiving a letter from themthe same day. “Extra-sensory perception” (ESP) seems to operate when we arerelaxed, and thinking about something else.All this, then, seems to offer a basis for an explanation of the poltergeist. Itis true that human powers of psychokinesis seem rather feeble—it would be farmore convincing if we could point to some medium or psychic who could causeobjects to fly around the room at will. But then, perhaps the explanation isthat the “door-keeper” inhibits the natural powers of the right brain. Even good“mediums” cannot put themselves into a “sensitive” state at will; some of themneed to go into a trance; others need to be in the right frame of mind. Trancemediums who try to “work normally” (i.e., when wide awake) often find itexhausting and frustrating, because the “censor” keeps getting in the way. So ifthe poltergeist is some peculiar power or force residing in the right brain,perhaps this explains why it cannot be called upon at will, even by giftedpsychics such as Uri Geller.Dowsing also provides us with a possible explanation of the origin of thatforce. In some dowsers, the presence of underground water produces such apowerful effect that they go into violent convulsions. One of the most famous ofFrench dowsers, Barthelemy Bléton, discovered his powers accidentally at the ageof seven; he was taking his father’s meal out to the fields when he sat down ona certain spot, and felt sick and faint. Digging at this spot revealed apowerful underground stream. Again, an old lady who is a member of the BritishSociety of Dowsers described at a conference a few years ago how she could pickup a large branch from the ground, and it would swing around in her hand like apointer until it indicated water.If the dowsing rod is responding to some magnetic force, either in water orstanding stones, it seems possible that this same force, channeled through theright brain, could provide the energy for poltergeist effects.It looks, then, as if the modern psychical investigator is in a far betterposition than his predecessor of a century ago when it comes to constructingtheories about the paranormal. The recognition of the “two people” inside ourheads may be the most important step ever taken in this direction.Having said this, it is necessary to admit that most of the mystery remainsunexplained. Lodge’s “psychometric hypothesis” and Lethbridge’s theory of“ghouls” may provide an explanation for the majority of ghosts—but what aboutall those cases in which the witnesses insist that the ghost behaved as if itsaw them? Again, it would certainly be convenient if we could explain thepoltergeist in terms of “unconscious psychokinesis.” But why has no psychic beenable to duplicate poltergeist effects? It is not really an answer to say thatthey have not learned to switch the power on and off. Many psychics can switchother powers on and off—telepathy, psychokinesis, second sight. So why not poltergeist effects?These awkward questions remind us that there are others we have failed toanswer. In the case of Lombroso’s bottle-smashing poltergeist in the Via Bava,why did it stop smashing bottles when the wife went away for the first time? IfLombroso is correct, and the poltergeist was a “spirit” that drew its energyfrom people, then we have our explanation. The spirit needed energy from boththe wife and the young waiter to smash bottles and crockery. When the wife wentaway for the first time, it lost half its energy supply and decided to take arest. But the second time she went away, she cursed it, and it made a specialeffort to be disagreeable. In order to do this, it had to make use of the“vestigial energy” she had left on dishes and other objects she had touched.When the young waiter was eventually dismissed, the wife alone could not providesufficient energy for its needs and it went elsewhere . . .Modern psychical research has a way of ignoring such questions. It prefersstraightforward distinctions. If there is a “medium” present (or, as we now say,a “focus”), then it is a poltergeist; if not, then it is a ghost.But even this pleasantly simple distinction proves to be less useful than itlooks. The “spirits” themselves seem to dislike being type-cast, and oftendecline to stick to their proper role. A case that starts as an ordinaryhaunting may develop into a poltergeist haunting, and vice versa. And then, justto confuse the issue, the spirits occasionally identify themselves as devils anddemons, and manifest themselves in the highly disturbing form known as“possession.” This subject is so complex that it deserves a chapter to itself.[1]. Encyclopedia of the Unexplained, p. 197.[2]. California Institute of Technology.[3]. In Mysteries, p. 116."},{"pageContent":"two [../Text/Contents.xhtml#two-anchor]Possession is Nine Points of the LawParis has always led the rest of the world in new fads and crazes—from thecan-can in the 1830s, to existentialism in the 1940s. In 1850, the newest andmost exciting craze was “table turning.” The rules were simple. A group ofpeople sat around a table, resting their fingertips lightly on the surface,their fingers spread wide so that everyone’s hands touched those of the neighboron either side. When conditions were favorable, the table would begin tovibrate, then to move of its own accord. It might twist around at an angle ofninety degrees, or rise up into the air, or simply balance on two legs.This entertainment had, of course, originated in America, the home of modern“Spiritualism.” In March 1848 the Fox family, who lived in a farmhouse in thevillage of Hydesville, New York, were kept awake at night by loud rappingnoises, which defied all attempts to track them down. One of the two younger Foxsisters—Margaret was fifteen and Kate twelve—started snapping her fingers, andthe raps imitated the sounds she made. A neighbor who came in to hear the rapstried asking questions, with one rap for “yes” and two for “no.” The obligingspirit was able to give the age of various people who were present and to answervarious othernumerical questions.At this point, the neighbor had the idea of devising an alphabetical code, andasking the spirit to answer questions about itself. It identified itself as apeddler named Charles B. Rosma, who had died in the house five years earlier.Asked for details, it said that it had been murdered in the east bedroom byhaving its throat cut, and had subsequently been buried in the cellar. Policeinvestigation failed to locate a missing peddler named Rosma, and the murderinquiry was not pursued.[1] Soon afterward, the poltergeist rappings turned intoa normal “haunting,” with sounds of a death struggle, horrible gurglings(presumably as the man’s throat was cut) and the sounds of a body being draggedacross the floor. (Mr. Fox’s hair turned white as a result.)Meanwhile, the rapping noises followed the girls around from house to house.Various committees were set up to try and detect the girls in trickery—entirelywithout success. When Kate and Margaret separated to avoid the furor, therappings broke out in both houses they stayed in. A man named Calvin Brown, wholived in the same house as the eldest Fox sister, Leah, seemed to arouse thespirit’s dislike because of his hostile attitude, and it began to persecute him.Various objects were thrown at him—but without ever causing injury. Then the“spirit”’ began snatching off Mrs. Fox’s cap, pulling the comb out of her hair,as well as jabbing pins into members of the family when they knelt down to pray.The rappings turned into deafening bangs like a cannon, which could be heard amile away.The household was in despair until someone decided to try and communicate withthe spirit by using the alphabetical code. The result was a message beginning:“Dear friends, you must proclaim this truth to the world. This is the dawning ofa new era . . .” It proved to be correct. The first “spiritualist” meeting tookplace on November 14, 1849, and within months this new “religion” had spreadacross America, then across the sea to Europe.All three sisters—including Leah—developed into “mediums,” and gave séances. Thesimplest method of holding a séance is for everyone to sit around the tables andcall upon the spirits. And at a very early stage, the spirits began indicatingtheir presence by causing the table to vibrate, or even making it give raps byraising one leg in the air and banging it on the floor. It seemed astonishinglyeasy to make a table move (as, indeed, it still is). It was discovered that thebest method was to take a fairly light table—a card table for preference—andplace it on a smooth polished floor. The “sisters” then had to join theirfingers in a “chain” and concentrate. And usually, within minutes, the table wassliding around the room, sometimes even rising into the air, in spite of allefforts to hold it down.The Parisians were thrilled with this new game; there had been nothing like itsince the days when Mesmer had “magnetized” groups of half-naked men and womenand sent them into ecstatic convulsions. What astonished everyone was how easyit was to get results. If the phenomena were really due to spirits, then theyseemed to be permanently on duty.One of Paris’ best-known intellectuals at this time was an educationalist calledLeon Dénizarth-Hippolyte Rivail. Rivail was to Paris what John Ruskin andHerbert Spencer would become to London: a kind of universal educator, willing todispense knowledge on any and every topic. His public lectures on such subjectsas chemistry and astronomy were attended by huge audiences.Rivail was one of the few people who still believed in the discoveries ofMesmer, that remarkable physician who had been driven out of Paris seventy yearsearlier by the hostility of the medical profession. Mesmer believed thatillnesses can be cured by magnets, and one of his disciples made the discoverywith which Mesmer’s name is often identified—hypnotism. But when the doctorssucceeded in driving Mesmer out of France, they also succeeded in convincingmost people that hypnotism was a fraud. Rivail was sufficiently independent totest it for himself, and discovered that it worked. He also discovered that,contrary to what the doctors insisted, magnets could produce remarkable effectson sick people, as could various metals such as gold and copper. (Thisinteresting notion still awaits rediscovery by the medical profession.) SoRivail was prepared to be open-minded on the subject of table-turning. He didnot permit himself to be prejudiced by the fact that every empty-headedsociety woman in Paris was organizing séances, and that even the much despisedemperor Napoleon the Third (whom Victor Hugo denounced as Napoleon the Little)held sessions at Versailles. He looked into the matter with his usual intensecuriosity and scientific detachment.Now it so happened that a friend of Rivail’s named Becquet had two daughters whohad begun to experiment with the new craze, and had discovered that they seemedto be excellent “mediums.” It seemed to Rivail that this was not an opportunityto be missed. If the spirits really had anything sensible to communicate, thenpresumably they would be willing to answer questions put by a man of science.Accordingly, the Becquet girls were asked to devote a few hours every week toautomatic writing; and to ask the “spirits” a number of specific questionswritten down by Rivail.The results surpassed his most optimistic expectations. The spirits, it seemed,were anxious to explain themselves at length. Rivail was excited to find thatwhat they said seemed to make sense, and constituted a remarkable and consistentphilosophy about life and death. Interestingly enough, they seemed to agree withMesmer, who said that the universe is pervaded by a vital or magnetic “fluid.”When this fluid is able to flow through living beings, the result is health;when it is blocked, the result is illness.According to Rivail’s informants, the universe is pervaded by spirits ofincorporeal intelligences. Human beings are simply “incarnate spirits,” spiritsunited with a material body. They advance toward perfection by undergoing trialsduring their lifetime, and after one body dies, they are reincarnated in anotherone. In between reincarnations, they may wander around without a body. It isthese “discarnate spirits” that are responsible for various forms of mischief,such as poltergeist effects.In due course, the spirits instructed Rivail to publish the results of hisquestions. They gave him a title—The Spirits’ Book—and even told him thepseudonym he should use: Allan Kardec—both names he had borne in a previousexistence, they told him.The Spirits’ Book appeared in 1856, and created a sensation. Kardec became thefounder-figure of the French spiritualist movement, and his works attainedimmense influence. But he died of a heart attack only thirteen years after thebook was published, at the age of sixty-five, and his influence was soon beingwidely questioned by the French spiritualist movement. Rivail was totallycommitted to the doctrine of reincarnation, the slow perfection of the spiritthrough a series of rebirths, which can be traced back to ancient India. Butmost of the “spirits” who spoke through mediums at séances had nothing to sayabout reincarnation. So Rivail was inclined to be critical about trance mediums,while the trance mediums and their followers denounced Rivail as a dogmatic oldman. After Rivail’s death, his influence waned, and within a few years he washalf-forgotten. Oddly enough, his works received immediate and widespreadacceptance in South America, particularly in Brazil, and became the foundationof a religion—which calls itself Spiritism—which still flourishes there. Weshall examine this at length in chapter Six.Now in Paris, in 1860, there was a particularly violent poltergeist in the Ruedes Noyers; it smashed every window in the place, hurled all kinds of objectsaround the house (including many which the occupants had never seen before), andfinally drove the unfortunate people out of the house. Rivail decided to try tofind out what exactly had happened. His medium’s “control” (i.e., the spirit whoacts as master of ceremonies) explained that the disturbances were the work of amischievous spirit. And, at the request of the control (a spirit called SaintLouis), the poltergeist of the Rue des Noyers was summoned. He appeared to be ina bad temper, and asked irritably: “Why do you call me? Do you want to have somestones thrown at you?” Rivail now asked the spirit: “Was there anyone in the Ruedes Noyers who helped you play tricks on the inmates?” Certainly, replied thespirit, it had had an excellent “instrument.” It added, “For I am merry and liketo amuse myself sometimes.” Who was it, Rivail asked. “A maidservant.”“Was she unaware you were making use of her?”“Oh yes, poor girl—she was the most frightened of them all.”Rivail asked how the spirit managed to throw various objects about the place,and received the interesting answer: “I helped myself through the electricnature of the girl, joined to my own . . . thus we were able to transport theobjects between us.”Rivail asked the spirit who it was. It replied that it had been dead about fiftyyears, and had been a rag and bone man. People used to make fun of him becausehe drank too much, and this was why he decided to play tricks on the inhabitantsof the Rue des Noyers. He indignantly denied that he had done these things outof malice; it was merely his way of amusing himself.This spirit seemed to belong to a class described in The Spirits’ Book: “Theyare ignorant, mischievous, unreasonable, and addicted to mockery. They meddlewith everything and reply to every question without paying attention to thetruth.” This latter remark brings to mind a comment by G. K. Chesterton, whodescribes in his autobiography how he once experimented with a planchette—adevice for automatic writing. The sitters asked one of the “spirits” the name ofa distant relative, and the board answered “Manning.” When they said this wasuntrue, it wrote: “Married before.” “To whom?” “Cardinal Manning.” Chestertonremarks:I saw quite enough of the thing to be able to testify, with complete certainty,that something happens which is not in the ordinary sense natural . . . Whetherit is produced by some subconscious but still human force, or by some powers,good, bad or indifferent, which are external to humanity, I would not myselfattempt to decide. The only thing I will say with complete confidence about thatmystic and invisible power is that it tells lies.Elsewhere, Rivail asked the spirits about the subject of “demoniacalpossession,” and how far human beings can be unconsciously influenced byspirits. The answer to the latter question was that the influence of spirits isfar greater than most people suppose—that they often influence our thoughts andactions. This is a theme that is often repeated in the books of “Allan Kardec.”Asked about possession, the spirit replied: “A spirit does not enter into a bodyas you enter into a house. He assimilates himself to an incarnate spirit who hasthe same defects and the same qualities as himself, in order that they may actconjointly.” But, it added, the spirit cannot actually “take over” the body ofthe person it is “possessing.” This is united indissolubly to the physical body.In that case, asked Rivail, can a person be dominated and subjugated by a spirituntil its own will is paralyzed? Yes, came the reply, this is precisely what ismeant by possession. But the domination is established through the cooperationof the “possessed,” either out of weakness or of their own free will. It addedsensibly that many people who seem to be possessed are really cases of epilepsyor madness, and demand a doctor rather than an exorcist. Rivail asked whetherexorcism actually has any power over such spirits, and got the answer: “No. Whenbad spirits see anyone trying to influence them by such means, they laugh.” Infact, any investigator who has had anything to do with poltergeists knows thatthey cannot be exorcised.The modern revival of interest in the subject of “demoniacal possession” waslargely the result of Aldous Huxley’s book The Devils of Loudun, published in1952 and, later, of William Blatty’s novel The Exorcist. Huxley takes askeptical view of the possession of a convent full ofUrsuline nuns:Bogus demoniac possession, artfully faked by a whole convent of hystericalUrsulines, under the coaching of their spiritual directors; monks plotting withlawyers to bear false witness against a hated professional and sexual rival; afornicating priest, enmeshed in the toils of his own lust and vanity and at lastjudicially murdered on a false charge and with every refinement of cruelty—it isa story that takes a high place inthe annals of human beastliness in general and religious beastliness inparticular . . .[2]Father Urbain Grandier, the parish priest of the small town of Loudun, wascharged in 1633 of “bewitching” the nuns of the local convent, who had beengoing into convulsions and howling blasphemies in hoarse voices. When Grandierwas finally taken in to perform an exorcism ceremony, the nuns began to accusehim of being responsible. Convinced of the absurdity of the charge, Grandiermade no real attempt to defend himself until it was too late. Then he wastortured and publicly burnt.Huxley is undoubtedly correct when he speaks of the plots against Grandier, andabout Grandier’s own fornications—he seduced at least two young girls in theconfessional and made one of them pregnant. There also seems to be no doubt thatthe “plot” against Grandier began as a practical joke, with some of the novicesfrightening the others by dressing up in a white sheet and pretending to beghosts. But when we come to examine the actual “possession,” the skepticalexplanation no longer seems adequate. Four of the priests who came to exorcisethe “devils” were themselves possessed, and two of them died of it. FatherSurin, a remarkable mystic, became more-or-less insane for twenty-five years.The unfortunate Father Tranquille, a famous Capuchin preacher, went along toLoudun convinced that the authority of the Church would protect him from the“devils”; he proved to be mistaken. He found himself in the horrifying positionof writhing around on the ground, listening to his mouth uttering blasphemies,while his mind remained a detached spectator. This continued until he died in astate of exhaustion. In a famous study of psychological possession, the Germanphilosopher T. K. Oesterreich observes accurately: “This death is one of themost frightful which can be imagined, the patient being sick in mind while fullyconscious, and a prey to excitement so violent that finally the organism breaksdown under it.” The same thing happened to Father Lactance, who had “expelledthree demons” from the prioress of the convent, Sister Jeanne des Anges.Surin came to Loudun after Grandier had been burnt. His death did not put an endto the possession of the nuns. Father Lactance was already dead. And fairlysoon, Surin was writing to a friend:God has . . . permitted the devils to pass out of the possessed person’s bodyand, entering into mine, to assault me, to throw me down, to torment me . . . Ifind it almost impossible to explain what happens to me during this time, howthis alien spirit is united to mine, without depriving me of consciousness or ofinner freedom, and yet constituting a second “me,” as though I had two souls, ofwhich one is dispossessed of my body and the use of its organs, and keeps itsquarters, watching the other, the intruder, doing whatever it likes . . . Thevery soul is as though divided . . . At one and the same time I feel greatpeace, as being under God’s good pleasure, and on the other hand (withoutknowing how) an overpowering rage and loathing of God, expressing itself infrantic struggles (astonishing to those who watch them) to separate myselffrom Him.Now it is by no means impossible to explain all this in purely psychologicalterms. Poe has written about it in a story called “The Imp of the Perverse,” inwhich he discusses the way in which we can feel a sudden urge to do somethingthat horrifies us; the narrator of his story has succeeded in committing a“perfect murder,” and cannot resist a compulsion to go and shout about it in thestreet.There is nothing very strange in this. It is simply the operation of what thepsychiatrist Viktor Frankl calls “the law of reverse effort.” The more astutterer wants to stop stuttering, the worse he stutters. On the other hand,Frankl mentions a stutterer who was asked to play a stutterer in the schoolplay, and was then unable to stutter. All this is explained by the recognitionthat “you” live in the left half of the brain, and that another “you” lives afew centimeters away in the other half. As soon as the left begins to interferetoo much, it has the effect of “throttling” the right, just as if a man hadgrabbed himself by the throat. We are all of us “divided selves.”But it is one thing to stutter and stammer, and quite another to die ofexhaustion in the belief that you are tormented by a devil. Looking detachedlyat the case of the Loudun demons, it is difficult not to feel that The Spirits’Book of Kardec explains it rather better than Huxley does. If we assume that thewhole thing began as a plot against Grandier, and a sexual obsession on the partof the nuns—particularly Sister Jeanne des Anges—then we can begin to understandwhat Kardec’s “St. Louis” meant when he explained: “A spirit does not enter intoa body as you enter into a house. He assimilates himself to a [person] who hasthe same defects and the same qualities as himself . . .” Fathers Lactance andTranquille behaved with a frightful vengefulness—Lactance superintended thetorture of Grandier—and therefore laid themselves open to “possession.” As toSister Jeanne, she later wrote an autobiography in which it is made perfectlyclear that she never much enjoyed being a nun; she was a dominant woman, anddominant women are usually “highly sexed.” She admits that she made no realeffort to push aside the indecent thoughts that came into her head when she waspraying or taking communion. “This accursed spirit insinuated himself into me sosubtly that I in no way recognized his workings . . .” She may have started outwith a more or less conscious desire to cause trouble for Father Grandier; but apoint came where, like Tranquille and Lactance, she found her body being used bydemons. Unlike Tranquille and Lactance, she rather enjoyedbeing possessed.The case on which William Blatty based The Exorcist took place in a Washingtonsuburb, Mount Rainier, in 1949. Thirteen-year-old Douglass Deen was the “focus”of the occurrences, which began with a scratching noise in the walls. A ratextermination company was able to find no sign of rats or mice. The soundsoccurred only when Douglass was near by. Then more usual poltergeist phenomenabegan to occur: dishes flew through the air, fruit was hurled against the wall.A picture floated off the wall, hovered in the air, then went back to its oldposition. After this, Douglass’ bed began to shake and quiver when he was in it.The family asked the local minister, the Reverend M. Winston, for help, and onFebruary 17, 1949, Douglass spent the night in his home. The two retired to aroom with twin beds. Douglass’ bed soon began to vibrate, and there werescratching noises in the walls. Winston asked Douglass to sleep in an armchair.The chair slid over to the wall, then slowly tilted until it threw the boy onthe floor. The minister improvised a bed on the floor; as soon as Douglass wasin it, the bed slid across the room.As these events continued, the boy was taken to two hospitals, Georgetown andSt. Louis University, both Jesuit institutions. All attempts to treat himmedically and psychiatrically were unsuccessful. Finally, a Jesuit priestundertook the exorcism. He fasted for two and a half months on bread and water,and repeated the ritual of exorcism no fewer than thirty times. The “spirit”showed its objection to these rituals—or perhaps its contempt—by sending the boyinto convulsions, making him scream obscenities and blasphemies in a shrillvoice, and sometimes making him reply to the exorcism in Latin—a language he hadnever studied. Finally, in May 1949, the phenomena ceased; the thirtiethexorcism was apparently successful. But then, as we shall see, most poltergeistphenomena last only a month or so; it may have gone away of its own accord.Here, then, we have a case of poltergeist disturbances that turned into“demoniacal possession,” with all the phenomena that occurred in the Louduncase. The “psychological” explanation would be that Douglass Deen’s “other self”began by producing poltergeist disturbances, then took up the game of demonicpossession suggested by the Jesuit fathers. (His ability to speak Latin is notas surprising as it sounds; he must have heard a great deal of Latin during hislife—at mass—and may have picked it up unconsciously.) But Kardec’s explanationabout a mischievous spirit fits equally well. If Kardec is correct, then thephysical changes that occur during puberty cause a “leakage” of a certain typeof energy that can be used by a poltergeist; this energy is probably some formof nerve-force. When the physical adjustments of puberty have been made, theleak stops, and the poltergeist can no longer manifest itself.In the Deen case, the two explanations seem equally plausible. But there areother cases where the balance of probability seems to rest closer to the Kardecexplanation. One of the best known of these has become known as “the Amherstmystery.” It took place in Amherst, Nova Scotia, in 1878. A shoe worker, DanielTeed, lived in a two-story house with his wife and two sons, his wife’s twounmarried sisters, Jane and Esther Cox, who were aged twenty-two and eighteen,his wife’s brother William, and his own brother, John. (The house must have beengrossly overcrowded.) All were Methodists. Jane, the elder sister, was pretty;Esther was short and rather stout. Nevertheless, Esther had a boyfriend, a localfactory worker named Bob MacNeal.In late August, Daniel Teed complained that someone had been milking the cow;Esther was a suspect as she was unusually fond of milk. Esther was sufferingfrom nervous tensions, and ran up from the cellar one night screaming that a rathad run over her leg. Her troubles were probably sexual in origin, as seems tobe revealed by a dream she had at the time: hundreds of black bulls with brightblue eyes and blood dripping from their mouths tried to break into the house,while Esther frantically locked the doors . . .The following evening, Esther and Bob MacNeal went out for a drive. Bob, who hada bad reputation locally, tried to persuade Esther to go into the woods withhim, but she refused. He pulled out a gun and ordered her to get down from thebuggy; he looked as if he might fire when the sound of an approaching vehicledistracted him. He leapt on to the buggy, drove back at a dangerous speed, letEsther off, then left Amherst for good. Esther cried herself to sleep, and forthe next few days had red eyes.On September 4, a damp, misty evening, Jane heard Esther sobbing in bed. ThenEsther screamed that there was a mouse in bed with her. They searched, but nomouse was found. The following night, both heard a rustling noise, and made asearch. It seemed to be coming from a cardboard box containing patchwork, soJane stood it in the middle of the room, expecting a mouse to run out. Insteadthe box jumped into the air and fell over. She stood it up, and it jumped again.Daniel Teed came in to see what the noise was about, pushed the box under thebed, and told them to go to sleep.The next night, Esther went to bed early. Soon after the light went out, sheleapt out of bed shouting, “Jane, I’m dying.” Jane lit the lamp and saw thatEsther’s face was bright red, and her hair was standing on end. Daniel Teed camein, together with the other two men. Esther got back into bed, but began toscream. Her body appeared to be swelling like a balloon. Suddenly, there was aloud report like a clap of thunder. The men rushed out to search the house, butfound nothing. When they came back, Esther was back to normal and fast asleep.Two days later, as Esther was getting into bed, she began to feel ill again. Allthe bedclothes flew off the bed, and landed in the far corner of the room. Janefainted. Esther began to swell again. The men rushed in, and someone replacedthe bedclothes; they promptly flew off again, and a pillow hit John Teed on thehead; he left the house never to return. Again, there were some loud explosions.Esther stopped swelling, and fell asleep.The following day, a doctor came to see Esther. As she lay in bed, the pillowunder her head inflated, as if filled up with air, then collapsed, thenre-inflated itself. Raps sounded around the room. The bedclothes flew off. Therewas a scratching noise above Esther’s bed and, as they all watched, they sawwriting appearing on the wall. It said: “Esther, you are mine to kill.” A lumpof plaster detached itself from elsewhere on the wall and flew across the roomto the doctor’s feet. Then rappings and bangs continued for the next two hours,while Esther lay, terrified, on her bed.The following day, Esther complained of an “electric” feeling running throughher body. The doctor gave her morphine; instantly, there was a series of bangsand crashes that seemed to go up to the roof.These disturbances continued for another three weeks. Then, one night, Estherfell into a trance, became rigid, and told the story of what had happened withBob MacNeal. When she recovered consciousness, she admitted it was true. WhenJane said that Bob must be responsible for Esther’s problems, loud knockssuggested that the “spirit” agreed completely. Jane remarked that it seemed tounderstand what she said, whereupon there were three distinct raps. The doctortried asking the “spirit” simple questions, with one rap for no, two for “noanswer,” three for yes. But the doctor’s attempts to get it to explain itselfwere a total failure.Esther became a subject of controversy; the house was permanently full ofpeople. When a minister called to see her, a bucket of cold water on the kitchentable began to bubble as if it was boiling.In December, Esther developed a severe sore throat which turned to diphtheria.While she was ill, the manifestations ceased. Then she went away to convalesce.When she returned, the manifestations started immediately. Esther said she hearda voice telling her that the house was going to be set on fire. As she told theothers about this, a lighted match fell from the air on to the bed, and thesheets caught fire. Jane quickly put it out. More lighted matches fell aroundthe room, most of them going out immediately. The rapping noises started later,and when the family asked the “spirit” whether the house would be set alight, itreplied that it would not be. At that moment there was smoke from under Esther’sbed; they found that a dress had somehow transferred itself from the bedroomdoor, and had been set on fire.Three days later, Mrs. Teed smelled smoke coming from the cellar. They found abarrel of wood shavings burning vigorously and had some trouble putting it out.The villagers were alarmed about this; if the Teeds’ house caught fire, half thevillage would probably be burned down. They suggested that Esther ought to besent away. A neighbor named John White offered to take her in if she would dosome housework. For two weeks, all went well; then a scrubbing brush flew out ofEsther’s hand, went up to the ceiling, and came down and hit her on the head.White owned a restaurant, and Esther went to work there. An oven door refused tostay closed, and jumped off its hinges. Metal objects began flying at Esther asif she were a magnet, and a boy’s clasp knife made her back bleed. When ironspikes were laid in her lap, they quickly became too hot to touch.All this seemed to support the suspicion that Esther was somehow “electrified.”They tried making her wear a special pair of shoes with glass soles; but thesegave her headaches and made her nose bleed.When furniture began to move around the restaurant, John White decided it wastime for Esther to go home. Again, she left Amherst for a few months; first tostay with a man and his wife in New Brunswick, then to a farm three miles fromAmherst. She told various visitors about the “voices” that spoke to her—voiceswhich claimed to be the spirits that were causing the mischief. One of thesespirits, “Bob Nickle,” threatened her with fire and stabbing.In June, 1879, a stage magician named Walter Hubbell moved into the Teeds’cottage as a paying guest; he had heard about the “haunting” and thought itmight make the subject of a book. Within a few minutes of arriving, he had nodoubt that this was no fraud. His umbrella sailed through the air, then acarving knife landed at his feet, then his bag was “thrown,” then a chair shotacross the room and hit his own so hard that he nearly fell on the floor. Fromthen on, the chairs in every room he entered performed a dance. Esther told himhe was unpopular with the spirits. Undeterred, Hubbell tried asking themquestions by means of raps, and the spirits were able to tell him the numberengraved on his watch, and the dates of coins in his pockets. Later, Hubbell laydown on the settee and closed his eyes; Esther came into the room, and Hubbellcautiously peeped at her, perhaps hoping that she would give herself away as acheat. Instead, he saw a large glass paperweight float up across the room andrebound off the arm of the settee.During the next few days the poltergeist put on a special show for Hubbell.Objects floated around, strange noises were heard—like sawing wood and drummingon a washboard—and Esther was attacked by “six spirits” who stuck no fewer thanthirty pins in her. Small fires broke out—on one day there were forty-five ofthem—and the sound of a trumpet echoed through the house; they later found asmall silver trumpet which no one had ever seen before. When Esther went to thelocal minister to pray, “Bob Nickle” attacked her viciously on her return,cutting her head open with a bone and stabbing her in the face with a fork.Hubbell thought he saw a way of making money. He hired a hall and persuadedEsther to put on a “show” or the people of Amherst. Inevitably, the spiritsdeclined to operate, and the audience demanded theirmoney back.Tired of the non-stop disturbances, Daniel Teed sent Esther off to stay withsome obliging friends; Hubbell, who now had enough material for his book, wentto St. John to write it. It appeared in due course and went through severaleditions.During Esther’s stay with her friends, the spirits let her alone. She then tooka job on a farm owned by people called Davidson. Her friends found that variousarticles were missing, and these were located in the Davidsons’ barn. Esther wassuspected of theft, but before the case could be investigated the barn caughtfire and burned to the ground. Esther was accused of arson, and was sentenced tofour months in jail. After this, the manifestations came suddenly to an end.This abrupt termination of the “haunting” seems to favor the view that Esther’sown unconscious mind was responsible. This is, in fact, the view I favored whenI described the case briefly in a book called Mysteries. Esther was sexuallyfrustrated, and if Bob MacNeal had adopted a more gentlemanly way of seducingher, there would have been no Great Amherst Mystery (the title of Hubbell’sbook). Esther was a classic case of “the divided self”: a part of her longing togive herself to her lover, while the inhibitions induced by her background andtraining made this impossible. So when she rejected his advances, and hevanished into the night, her unconscious mind said, in effect: “Now see whatyou’ve done, stupid!” and set out to punish her. As to the effects themselves,many of them fit the hypothesis I have suggested: that the “energy” comes fromthe earth. When Esther wore shoes with glass soles, the manifestations stoppedbut she developed headaches and nosebleeds. Her sensation of electric currentsis also highly suggestive. There have been dozens of well-authenticated cases of“human electric batteries.” Again, nearly all concern girls or boys at the ageof puberty. Caroline Clare of Bondon, Ontario, began to lose weight at the ageof seventeen (in 1877), then developed such powerful electric currents thatpeople who touched her received severe shocks; pieces of metal stuck to her asif she were a magnet. Jennie Morgan of Sedalia, Missouri, became an electricbattery at fourteen; when she touched metal objects, sparks flew. FrankMcKinistry, also of Missouri, would develop an electric charge during the nightand slowly lose it during the day. When highly charged, his feet would stick tothe ground so that he had difficulty in walking—which sounds again as if theelectricity comes from the earth. (Good dowsers receive a “tingling” sensationwhen they touch standing stones.) The Amherst minister, the Reverend Edwin Clay,was convinced that the secret of Esther’s manifestations was electricity, andeven delivered a lecture to that effect.But how did Esther’s unconscious mind know the number of Hubbell’s watch and thedates of coins in its pocket—which no doubt he did not know himself? How did hermind scratch “Esther, you are mine to kill” on the wall above her head? How didit blow a trumpet all over the house? The truth is that the unconscious mindtheory needs to be stretched so much that it loses the chief virtue of a goodtheory—simplicity.But perhaps the strongest argument against the unconscious mind theory is simplythat Esther’s torment went on for so long. To actually read the case in detailis to feel that no one could get so angry with herself that she would continuerelentlessly for more than a year. We may say, “Oh, I could kick myself,” whenwe do something stupid; but no one has ever done it.The fraud hypothesis also fails to stand up to close examination. If Hubbell’sbook was the main piece of evidence, then we might well feel suspicious, sincehe went to Amherst with the hope of writing it, and eventually made a great dealof money from no fewer than ten editions. But there are accounts in the AmherstGazette that confirm everything Hubbell says. Moreover, in 1907, more than aquarter of a century after the events, the researcher Hereward Carrington wentto Amherst and took various depositions from people who had witnessed themanifestations. By this time, Esther was unhappily married, and had turned intoa sullen middle-aged woman, who agreed to talk to Carrington only on the paymentof a hundred dollars; Carrington felt that such testimony would be valueless.But there could be no doubt that most of the people involved believed that themanifestations were genuine, including the farmer, Davidson, whose barn had beendestroyed—he said that he had often watched Esther as she came downstairs andhad noticed that she seemed to fly or float. (In the Middle Ages, levitationused to be one of the criteria for demoniacal possession.)In 1919, Walter Franklin Prince, another eminent investigator of paranormalphenomena, wrote his own account of the Amherst case in the Proceedings of theAmerican Society for Psychical Research, heavily criticizing Hubbell forvagueness and inaccuracy. But Prince had to end by agreeing that there was noquestion of fraud. What Prince suggested was an interesting variant of the“unconscious mind” theory: the notion that Esther Cox was an example of abaffling psychological illness called “multiple personality,” in which anindividual splits into two or more completely different persons. One of the mostfamous cases of the twentieth century was that of a girl named ChristineSizemore, which became the basis of a book (and film), The Three Faces of Eve,by Thigpen and Cleckley. But similar cases have been observed and recorded indetail since the beginning of the nineteenth century. In 1811 a young womannamed Mary Reynolds, described as being “dull and melancholy,” fell into a deepsleep for twenty hours, and when she woke up had lost her memory. She was like anewborn baby. She recognized no one, and became lost in familiar places. She hadto be taught to speak, then to read and write—but learned so quickly that it wasclear that her buried memory was coming to her aid. Her brothers and sisterswere astonished at the change in her disposition. Suddenly, she was cheerful andbuoyant. But she worried her family by taking long walks in the Pennsylvaniawilderness, and ignoring their warnings about bears and poisonous snakes. Sheinsisted that the bears were actually black hogs. One day, she actually met onein the woods, when she was on horseback, and the horse refused to go on. Whenthe “hog” ignored her orders to get out of the way, she took a stick and walkedtoward it; at the last moment the bear dropped on all fours and went away.One morning about five weeks after losing her memory, it came back just assuddenly, and the old Mary Reynolds was back—a dull, cautious girl who had nofondness for nature. Then, a few weeks later, after an unusually deep sleep, the“new” Mary returned with no memory of the past days. And the two Marys continuedto alternate for the next twenty years, both of them finally coming to acceptthat the periods of amnesia were due to the revival of the “other self.”Finally, at the age of thirty-five, Mary stabilized, and settled down for therest of her life in her second personality. She died of a brain embolism at theage of sixty-one.The most obvious thing about the case is that the second Mary—the cheerfulone—contained elements that were not present in the first Mary: high spirits,love of nature, courage and daring. It is as if Mary’s unconscious mind gottired of her dullness and lack of enterprise, and decided to take over. But the“new Mary” was not, in all respects, an improvement; her insistence that bearswere hogs makes it sound as if she was slightly deranged. Eventually, the secondMary became strong enough to control the personality, and keep her “alter ego”out.Walter Prince suggested that Esther Cox was a kind of variant of MaryReynolds—and it is certainly true that Esther was, like “Mary One,” a dull andirritable girl, trapped in a rigid personality structure. The obvious objectionis that Prince’s hypothesis about “dual personality” still fails to explain allthe poltergeist occurrences.Yet Prince’s argument begins to look rather more plausible in the light of acase of which he had direct personal experience. In 1910, Prince’s wife got toknow a girl called Doris (in his account, Prince gives her the pseudonym DorisFischer). She was an easygoing, sweet-natured girl who lived with her drunkenfather, and who suffered periodic fits of amnesia, during which she was “takenover” by no fewer than three other personalities. Prince was so fascinated bythe case that he invited Doris to come and live in his home, and ended bycompletely curing her.Doris’ problems had started when she was three years old; her father came indrunk one night, snatched her from her mother’s arms, and hurled her on thefloor. This had the effect of causing instant amnesia. Doris remembered nothingmore until the following morning, when she suddenly found herself at the foot ofthe stairs. There had been a slight snap of the neck, as if an electric currenthad been switched on. Yet her mother had seen her walk upstairs in the normalway.What Doris did not realize was that while she was in a state of amnesia, anotherpersonality had taken over her body, a mischievous little girl called Margaret.Like Mary Reynolds’ “second personality,” Margaret was a good-natured madcap, abright, vivacious child who was generally liked. While Doris was serious andstudious, Margaret was empty-headed and a born truant. Doris would promise herparents not to go swimming in the river; Margaret would go swimming, then slipout of the body and leave Doris to take the punishment. On one occasion, whenDoris reached for a piece of cake, she “blanked out,” and Margaret snatched thecake and ate it.Oddly enough, Margaret knew all about Doris, but Doris knew nothing aboutMargaret until, one day, Margaret decided to tell her. So, leaving Doris’consciousness fully awake, she told Doris the whole story, using Doris’ mouth tospeak the words. This sounds very much like the “demoniacal possession” ofFather Surin, watching his body convulse while unable to do anything about it.When Doris was in her mid-teens, she graduated at the top of her class anddecided to go on to high school. Margaret, who hated studying, refused; and,since she was the stronger personality, Doris left school and went to work as aseamstress.At seventeen, another personality “appeared.” One day at work, Doris had avisual hallucination of her mother; she rushed home and found her mother dyingof sudden acute pneumonia. In the early hours of the morning, her mother died.Then her father staggered in, dead drunk, and, without noticing that his wifewas dead, fell into bed and began to snore. Doris experienced a pain in herhead, and again lost her memory. This new “Doris” was—like the second MaryReynolds—virtually a new-born baby, entirely without memory. It was Margaret whohad to teach her to speak. This new personality was nervous and rather stupid, athoroughly dull, conventional girl with a monotonous voice.When Doris was eighteen, she slipped and fell on the back of her head; as aresult, yet another personality began to take over the body. This one was evenless complex than the previous invader; she seemed to be little more than amemory, and could repeat word for word long conversations that Doris had had inchildhood.When Prince began to study Doris, in 1911, he realized that she seemed to be anincredibly complex series of persons, like Chinese boxes. First, there was Dorisherself, a good-natured sensible girl, who unfortunately never seemed to be ableto spend more than a few hours at a time in charge of her own body. She waslikely to be taken over by Margaret, who was a delightful and mischievousten-year-old—she had stopped developing at that age—who loved playing withdolls, and kept everybody in fits of laughter. Then there was the dull girl whohad taken over when Doris’ mother died, and whom Prince called Sick Doris—shewas also rather childlike. The “tape recorder” personality also made briefappearances—Prince called her “Sleeping Real Doris.” He also discovered thatthere was yet another personality, more mature and complex than any of theothers, whom he called “Sleeping Margaret” because she put in an appearance whenMargaret fell asleep. This personality seemed to be able to see into the mindsof all the others. She also claimed to be a spirit or guardian angel who hadcome in reply to the prayers of Doris’ mother for someone to protect herdaughter.So the personalities in Doris’ body seemed to form a kind of hierarchy or“ladder.” At the top was “Sleeping Margaret,” the “guardian angel.” Next camethe mischievous and childish Margaret. Then Doris, then “Sick Doris,” then the“tape recorder,” Sleeping Real Doris.Margaret could “eject” Doris at a moment’s notice. Sometimes, Doris would behalf-way through a sentence when suddenly her expression would alter, andMargaret would take over, with her typical mischievous grin. But Margaret wasunaware of the “guardian angel” and on one occasion when she had unceremoniouslyforced Doris out of the body, the guardian angel got angry and forced Margaretout. Later that day, Margaret reappeared and confided to Prince that there mustbe someone else in this body because someone had thrown her out.In the security of Prince’s household, Doris improved steadily. The personalitycalled Sick Doris began to fade out; she became virtually an idiot, and she andPrince took a final walk together and had a touching leavetaking. Then shereverted to babyhood, and “died.” As an experiment, Prince tried encouraging the“tape recorder,” seeing if he could turn her into something more like a humanbeing; she responded so well that Prince decided it would be unwise to carry on.She also faded away.Margaret also began to “grow backwards” as Doris’ confidence increased, becomingmore and more child-like and using the German pronunciations of Doris’childhood. Her senses seemed to fade, and her visual field narrowed until shecould only see directly in front of her—like a baby. Then she too faded away.The “guardian angel” never faded away; she remained around, and sometimesemerged after Doris had fallen asleep, and had long and interesting talks withPrince. In 1916, when someone suggested that Doris should go to New York to sitwith a medium, Prince was dubious until “Sleeping Margaret” assured him thatDoris would be perfectly safe in her hands. She was as good as her word, and theresult was a remarkable series of séances in which the spirit of Doris’mother—or someone who claimed to be—wrote out long messages that showed anintimate knowledge of Doris’ background. Doris’ “mother” also insisted that allthat had happened to her daughter was simply a case of “benevolent possession.”And it has to be admitted that this explanation fits the facts amazingly well.For, on the whole, Doris’ experience of multiple personality was not unpleasant.Margaret, although mischievous, was a good-natured and happy child, and theother personalities seem to have been basically harmless. Prince was disposed tobelieve the assertion of “Sleeping Margaret” that she was a guardian spirit whohad come in answer to the prayers of the mother.It can now be seen why Prince thought it possible that the Amherst case involveddual personality. He was more than half convinced that the Doris case ofmultiple personality was actually one of benevolent possession, so in suggestingthat Esther was a dual personality, he was, in effect, hinting that this couldbe a case of non-benevolent possession. At the same time, his position as awell-known psychiatrist meant that, for public consumption, he was bound to laymost of the emphasis on the purely psychological explanation—of both the Amherstand the Doris cases.And what is the psychological explanation? It depends, basically, upon therecognition that we are all, to some extent, multiple personalities, dividedselves. Part of Esther Cox wanted to be seduced by Bob MacNeal, but thepersonality structure induced by her upbringing made her resist his overtures.If he had been more subtle, and succeeded in persuading her to become hismistress, then the “old” Esther would have slipped into the background, and thenew, sexually experienced Esther would have taken her place.We all spend our lives trying to get rid of our “old” selves and develop new—andless constricting—personality structures. This is why we all crave experience,why every boy wants to run away to sea and every girl wants to marry amillionaire with a yacht. But then, we also spend most of our lives reacting“automatically” to familiar circumstances, hardly aware of anything that isfurther than the end of our noses. So it is difficult to escape the “old self,”which consists largely of a set of habits. It is easy to see how rather dullpeople—like Mary Reynolds and Esther Cox—become trapped to the point ofsuffocation in this mechanical, habit-bound personality structure, and how theunconscious life urges—perhaps working through the right brain—can plan tooverthrow the dreary tyrant.But before we allow ourselves to be persuaded by this explanation, there arestill a few curious points about the Doris case to consider. One of these is howseveral personalities could apparently reside together in the same body. WhileDoris was “in” the body—i.e., in charge of its movements—Margaret might be also“in,” aware of everything that Doris was watching and thinking, and having herown ideas and opinions. Doris could be fast asleep, while Margaret was awake,observing her dreams. Moreover, the “guardian angel,” who explained all this toWalter Prince, was also able to be “in,” observing both Doris and Margaret,unobserved by both.It is difficult to see how this could take place inside the head of a normalperson, even if she happened to be torn by self-division. What the “guardianangel” is explaining sounds like a number of independent spirits, or entities,making use of Doris’ body. (Significantly, Doris herself was unable to be awareof any of her other “selves” and their activities.)Again, there exist a number of photographs of Doris’ different personalities.One photograph shows Doris herself, and the caption explains that “Sick Doris”had sat down for the picture, but Doris had “taken over” for a few moments asthe camera clicked. Another photograph of “Sick Doris” reveals that she is,indeed, a quite different person from Doris—she looks wooden and stolid, quiteunlike the gentle, sensitive Doris. Margaret looks so completely unlike bothDorises that it is hard to realize that she is using the same body. In theProceedings of the American Society for Psychical Research, Prince alsodescribes another case of amnesia, a man he calls Heinrich Myer. Again, thephotographs of the primary and secondary personalities are incredibly different.Physically, they are very similar, yet a different person looks out through theeyes of each. It is tempting for the non-professional observer to say simplythat the same body has been taken over by different spirits.Let us consider again the assertion of the “guardian angel” (and of Doris’mother) that the Doris case is basically one of “benevolent possession.” Princetries to explain the coming and going of the personalities in terms of wearinessand exhaustion. Doris was easily tired out, and when she grew tired, Margaretwould take over. While Margaret was “in” the body, she would say that Doris was“resting.” Prince’s theory is that Doris became a dual personality as athree-year-old child—to save herself from total breakdown. The shock of beingsnatched from her mother’s arms and hurled on the floor might have seriouslydamaged her, perhaps turned her into a timid, listless, miserable child.Instead, the “guardian angel” took over the body (she insisted to Prince thatshe came first, before Margaret), and was later assisted by Margaret.We know that sudden shock can destroy the reason, perhaps turning the personinto a “vegetable.” It is, in effect, as if a ship had been torpedoed. Otherkinds of stress and misery can cause something more like a “slow leak”; adraining of vital energy. This is what happened to the unfortunate FatherTranquille, who virtually died of “shock” after being “possessed” by the“spirits.” He went into “exhaust status.” Prince’s theory is that dual (ormultiple) personality occurs when severe shock threatens a person’s mentalstability. The “other personality” could be considered as the mind’s own defenseagainst destruction. And, in fact, the majority of cases of multiple personalitybegin with a bad shock that threatens to overwhelm the person with“discouragement.” We can see how such a shock might turn Doris—at the age ofthree—into Margaret, who treated life as a joke. But it is almost impossible tounderstand how it could create “Sleeping Margaret,” the “guardian angel.”In The Devils of Loudun, Aldous Huxley tries to explain the behavior of SisterJeanne des Anges by appealing to the concept of multiple personality. He prefersto speak of the case of “Christine Beauchamp,” recorded by another famousAmerican professor of psychology, Morton Prince, around the turn of the century.(Her real name was Clara N. Fowler.) Huxley summarizes the case:Here is Miss Beauchamp, a blameless but rather sickly young woman, full of highprinciples, inhibitions and anxiety. From time to time she plays truant fromherself and behaves like a very naughty and exuberantly healthy child of ten.Questioned under hypnosis, this enfant terrible insists that she is not MissBeauchamp but someone else called Sally. After some hours or days Sallydisappears and Miss Beauchamp returns to consciousness—but returns only to herown consciousness, not to Sally’s; for she remembers nothing of what was done,in her name and through the agency of her body, while the latter was in control.Sally, on the contrary, knows all that goes on in Miss Beauchamp’s mind andmakes use of that knowledge to embarrass and torment the other tenant of theirshared body. Because he could think of these odd facts in terms of awell-substantiated theory of subconscious mental activity, and because he waswell acquainted with the techniques of hypnosis, Dr. Morton Prince, thepsychiatrist in charge of this case, was able to solve Miss Beauchamp’s problemsand to bring her for the first time in many years, to a state of physical andmental health.All that need be added is that the case of Christine Beauchamp—who lived inBoston—bears many resemblances to that of Doris Fischer. Her father was also adrunkard, and Christine became “neurasthenic” (inclined to suffer from nerves)when her mother died in unpleasant circumstances (which Prince does not detail).She greatly admired a close friend of her father’s named William Jones, whoseemed to her to possess all the qualities her father lacked; when Jones gotdrunk one night, and made some kind of sexual advance to her, she became evenmore depressed and neurasthenic. Prince began to treat her for generaldepression and fatigue, and tried hypnotizing her. This proved to be a mistake,in that it released the secondary personality—who called herself Sally—like agenie out of a bottle. From then on, Sally behaved toward Christine rather asMargaret did toward Doris, but with more malice. Sally, who was as strong as ahorse, would take a long walk into the countryside, then abandon the body to thefeeble Christine, who had to walk home. (One of the strangest features of casesof multiple personality is that the body seems to be as weak—or as strong—as thepersonality occupying it; in the case of “Eve”—Christine Sizemore—the secondarypersonality even emerged when the primary one was unconscious underanaesthetic.) When Christine went to New York to get an office job, Sally gotoff the train at New Haven and took a job as a waitress.The main point to note about the cases of Doris Fischer and Sally Beauchamp isthat the primary personality could be “dispossessed” of the body by thesecondary one—exactly as in the case of the devils of Loudun. And this is by nomeans a common feature of all such cases. Rather more typical is the case of theReverend Ansel Bourne who, in January 1887, drew five hundred dollars from hisbank and vanished. He then went to Norristown, Pennsylvania, rented a shop, andcarried on a trade as a shopkeeper under the name of A. J. Brown. Then one day“Bourne” reappeared, completely oblivious of what he had been doing since hewithdrew the money from the bank. Hypnotized by the psychologist William James,“Brown” came back—a completely different personality from Bourne. Brown knewnothing of Bourne, and vice versa, so there was no question of one displacingthe other at will. The same seems to be true of the Mary Reynolds case.Stranger still is the case of Mrs. Remibias Chua, a Philippino woman ofEvanston, Illinois. On February 21, 1977, a forty-eight-year-old Filipino nursenamed Teresita Basa was stabbed to death in her apartment in Chicago. An attempthad been made to burn the body, which was naked; the medical examinationrevealed that there had been no rape. The motive was robbery—Miss Basaapparently had a quantity of valuable jewelry.Teresita had worked at the Edgewater Hospital, where one of her colleagues wasanother Filipino, a respiratory therapist named Remy Chua, who was married to adoctor. Two weeks after the murder, Jennie Prince, the technical director of thedepartment, had said, “Teresita must be turning in her grave. Too bad she can’ttell the police who did it.” And Remy Chua replied seriously: “She can come tome in a dream. I’m not afraid.” Later the same day, when she was dozing in alocker room, she had a feeling that someone was trying to communicate with her.She opened her eyes, and saw Teresita Basa standing in front of her. In a panic,Remy Chua ran out of the room, and told her fellow workers about the apparition.Mrs. Chua began to dream about the murder. Again and again, she saw TeresitaBasa’s face, with the face of a man close behind it. One day, looking at theface of a hospital orderly named Allan Showery, a black man, she realized thathe was the man of her dream. Showery was a boastful sort of person, claimingthat he owned a town house, and kept an airplane at a nearby airfield so that hecould fly to New York for weekends to lecture. Now that she had come to believehe was Teresita Basa’s killer, Remy Chua became increasingly afraid of him.In early July, Mrs. Chua was dozing one evening while her husband talked on thephone to his attorney, a man named Al. As José Chua spoke the name “Al,” RemyChua began to scream. Then, in a kind of trance, she got up from the bed andwalked across the room, speaking in Tagalog, the language of the Philippines.When she lay down on the bed, a voice began to speak through her mouth: “I amTeresita Basa. I would like to ask for help from you.” Dr. Chua asked her whatshe wanted. “A man came into my apartment and killed me. I want you to tell thepolice.” Mrs. Chua woke up a few minutes later, and remembered nothing of whathad happened.The Chuas did nothing about it—although Remy Chua left the Edgewater Hospital. Afew weeks later, as she was making a phone call, Mrs. Chua again went into atrance. Once again, Teresita Basa’s voice spoke through her mouth: “Dr. Chua,did you talk to the police?” Dr. Chua said that he had no evidence to offerthem. This time, she named her killer as a man called Allan.A few days later, it happened again. Mrs. Chua went into a trance, and began toscream out in agony, “I’m burning!” Then the voice of Teresita Basa named AllanShowery as the man who had murdered her. She went on to say that he had stolenher jewelry, and given it to his girlfriend. She mentioned a number of peoplewho could identify her jewelry, even giving the telephone number of one of them.She added, “Tell them that Al came to fix my television, and he killed me andburned me.”This time, José Chua decided to call the police. Understandably, they wereunconvinced, and for several days made no attempt to question Showery. When theydid, Showery admitted that he had promised to call and repair the television,but insisted that he had simply forgotten. When they questioned his common-lawwife, she showed them a cocktail ring that Showery had given her. The policecalled the telephone number that Mrs. Chua had spoken in her trance. As aresult, Teresita Basa’s cousin was able to identify the ring as an item ofTeresita’s jewelry. Faced with this evidence, Showery broke down and admittedthat he had murdered Teresita Basa.In court, the defense attempted to have the case dismissed on the grounds thatthe evidence had been provided in such an unorthodox manner; they wereunsuccessful. Showery was sentenced to fourteen years for murder and four yearseach for two counts of armed robbery and arson.It is, of course, possible that Mrs. Chua suspected Showery, and that herunconscious mind chose this way of bringing her suspicions to the attention ofthe police—certainly, the case for “possession” would be far more convincing ifMrs. Chua had never heard of Teresita Basa or Allan Showery. Yet this stillfails to explain how Mrs. Chua knew about the cocktail ring, and the people whowould be able to identify it.The Chua case is fundamentally one of “mediumship”—she went into a trance, likea medium at a séance, and was “used” by another personality. But this drawsattention to a similar feature in many cases of multiple personality. MaryReynolds went into a long and very deep sleep before she was “taken over” by theother personality; Christine Beauchamp was hypnotized; Doris Fischer wasprobably stunned by her fall on the floor. The psychologist Pierre Janet washypnotizing a neurasthenic girl when he plunged her into a sleep so profoundthat she appeared to have stopped breathing; when she woke up, a secondarypersonality had taken over.In 1877, a fourteen-year-old French boy named Louis Vivé was attacked by a viperand severely traumatized. He began having fits and was sent to an asylum atBenneval. One day, he had an exceptionally severe attack which lasted fifteenhours. When he recovered, he had become a totally different personality. Theprimary personality had been a gentle, well-behaved youth who was paralyzed downhis right side and spoke with a bad stammer. The “new” Louis Vivé spokenormally, was unparalyzed, and was violent, dishonest and generally badlybehaved. After a conviction for theft, Vivé was sent to an asylum where thedoctors were fascinated by his case. They tried a technique for transferring his“sensibility” from one side to the other by means of powerful magnets, and thiswas astonishingly successful; the primary personality againbecame established.Here it seems clear that the viper attack caused some basic personalityupset—like Doris’ violent fall. The long fit, accompanied by a period of deepunconsciousness, allowed the secondary personality to “take over.” Thissecondary personality may have been connected with Vivé’s right cerebralhemisphere, since the “primary” Louis was paralyzed down the right side and hada stutter suggesting that it was the left hemisphere that was affected.In all these cases—with the obvious exception of Remy Chua—the secondarypersonality has been strikingly different from the primary one; almost as if thepersonalities had been created out of the same construction kit, and thesecondary one could only be created out of the pieces left over from the first.Christine Beauchamp, Doris Fischer, and Louis Vivé, were gentle anddocile—perhaps too docile; their secondary personalities were aggressive anduninhibited.But there are also cases that look far more like gentle “possession,” where thesecondary personality is anything but a mirror image of the primary one. One ofthe most striking cases on record is that of Lurancy Vennum, the “WatsekaWonder.” On July 11, 1877, a thirteen-year-old girl named Mary Lurancy Vennum,of Watseka, Illinois, had a fit and became unconscious. The unconsciousnessseemed to pass into a kind of trance in which she was able to speak; she claimedshe was in heaven, and talking to a little brother and sister who had died. Fromthen on, Lurancy continued to have these trances, in some of which she wasapparently “taken over” by various disagreeable entities, including a sullen oldwoman who called herself Katrina Hogan. The Vennum family was tempted to haveher committed to an asylum, but some friends called Roff persuaded them to callin a doctor, E. W. Stevens.When Stevens first saw Lurancy, the girl was in a bad mood—“possessed” byKatrina Hogan. Then she said she was a young man named Willie Canning. Stevenspersuaded her to be hypnotized; whereupon Lurancy returned and explained thatshe had been possessed by evil spirits. Stevens said she ought to try and find abetter “control” (a name mediums apply to the spirit who acts as master ofceremonies). Lurancy then mentioned that a girl named Mary Roff had offered tobecome her “control.” Mr. and Mrs. Roff, who were present, said that this wastheir daughter, who had died at the age of eighteen when Lurancy was a baby,twelve years earlier.The next day, Lurancy’s personality had changed. She now declared herself to beMary Roff, and said she wanted to go home. Lurancy’s father contacted the Roffs,and Mrs. Roff and her daughter (Mary’s sister) went to call at the Vennums’home. As they approached, Lurancy, who was looking out of the window, saidexcitedly: “Here comes my ma and sister Nervie!” She flung her arms around theirnecks and cried.In February 1878, “Mary” went back home with the Roffs, and told them that “theangels” would allow her to stay until May 21. She knew everyone—neighbors aswell as family—and showed an intimate acquaintance with the life of the deadMary Roff, who had died of mysterious fits in July 1865.The lengthy account of the case written by Dr. Stevens (and later expanded bythe researcher Richard Hodgson) is full of details which show that “Mary” knewthings that could not possibly have been known to Lurancy Vennum. Her parentstested her with a velvet headdress Mary used to wear; she recognized itimmediately. For three months “Mary” lived with her “parents,” and gave theminstance after instance of her knowledge of Mary Roff’s life. On one occasionshe mentioned an incident when Mary had cut her arm during a fit, and shestarted to roll up her sleeve to show the cut; then she seemed to recollectherself and said: “Oh, this is not my arm—mine is under the ground.” She claimedto have encountered two of Dr. Stevens’ deceased children in heaven, accuratelydescribed them, and also described Stevens’ own home in Janesville, Wisconsin.The house where the Roffs lived in 1878 was not the one in which Mary had diedin 1865. They passed this other house on the way to the Roffs, and “Mary”struggled hard to get into it; she correctly named it as the place in which shehad died. (She also accurately described her own funeral and described where shewas buried.)On May 21, 1878, Mary went around taking her leave of relatives and friends,hugging and kissing them. Then she left and returned to the Vennums’ house. Bythe time she arrived there, she had become Lurancy again. From then on, Lurancyremained more or less normal, marrying a farmer in 1882; but her mediumisticpowers remained, and after her marriage, Mary Roff made periodic “visits.”Richard Hodgson—who was associated with Morton Prince in the Christine Beauchampcase—agrees that the explanation could be that Mary Roff was simply a secondarypersonality of Lurancy Vennum’s; but in that case, the secondary personalitywould have had to possess paranormal powers—at the very least, of telepathy.Hodgson seems to feel that the “spiritualistic hypothesis” is preferable.But whether or not we can accept the notion of life after death, there can be nodoubt that all these cases seem to point in the same direction: to the notionthat the personality—or “spirit”—uses the body in much the same way that adriver makes use of a car. This flatly contradicts one of the most widelyaccepted notions of psychology—and indeed, of philosophy—that “personality” issome kind of “emanation” of the brain, and therefore of the body. Professor JohnTaylor writes in The Shape of Minds to Come: “We recognize personality as asummation of the different contributions to behavior from the various controlunits of the brain.” One of the most widely respected of modern philosophers,Gilbert Ryle, has devoted his most influential book, The Concept of Mind, toarguing that it is a mistake to think of “man” as a “ghost in a machine.” Man ishis body and brain. Yet the evidence we have examined so far in this chaptersuggests unmistakably that personality and body are as distinct as tenants andthe houses they live in. This, admittedly, sounds regrettablyold-fashioned—after all, the position “Man is a spirit” belongs to religionrather than science—yet it is hard to see how this conclusion can beside-stepped. Whether or not we can accept Kardec’s Spirits’ Book as acontribution to our scientific knowledge, it is necessary to admit that itsbasic theories explain the mysteries of the human personality rather moreconvincingly than Professors Taylor and Ryle.And what of Kardec’s other basic assertion: that spiritual evolution involvesreincarnation? Reincarnation—rebirth into another body—is, of course, closelyrelated to the whole problem of “possession,” as we can see in the case of MaryRoff, who was (temporarily) reincarnated in Lurancy Vennum’s body. The case of aHindu boy Jasbir Lal Jat, recorded by Dr. Ian Stevenson in Twenty CasesSuggestive of Reincarnation, is perhaps one of the most striking on record. Whenthe son of Sri Girdhari Lal Jat of Rasulpur, Uttar Pradesh, “died” of smallpoxin the spring of 1954, his father decided to leave the body unburied until thenext day. But before morning the boy had recovered, although he was unable tospeak. When he began to speak, he asserted that he was the son of Shankar, of avillage called Vehedi, twenty or so miles away. He claimed that he was ofBrahmin caste, and refused to eat food cooked by his “mother.” Only when a localBrahmin lady agreed to cook for him did he consent to eat. Gradually, over twoyears, he abandoned this insistence and ate with the rest of the family.According to Jasbir, he had attended a wedding and been given poisoned sweets;these led to a fall from a chariot, and a head injury from which he died. Oneday Jasbir recognized a woman who was visiting the village as his “aunt”—she wasin fact from Vehedi, and her nephew Sobha Ram had died just as Jasbir described.But the strange thing was that Sobha Ram had died in 1954, shortly before the“death” of the three-year-old Jasbir from smallpox. Jasbir later claimed thatafter his death, he had met a Sadhu (holy man) who had advised him to take overthe body of Jasbir, which he did.Sobha Ram’s father heard of the case, and went to Rasulpur to see Jasbir; Jasbirinstantly recognized him and other members of the family. A few weeks later,Jasbir was taken to Vehedi and asked to lead the way from the railway station tothe main square; he did this without difficulty, and then led the way to SobhaRam’s home. He stayed there for several days, demonstrating a detailed knowledgeof the family and its affairs. Dr. Stevenson investigated the case thoroughly,interviewing many witnesses in both families, as well as the boy himself. Thecase of the poisoned sweets has never been satisfactorily cleared up.The case of Jasbir is one of the most remarkable in Stevenson’s records; yetmost of them contain the same feature of recognition of the family and home ofthe alleged previous existence. (Stevenson’s twenty cases cover Brazil, India,Alaska and Lebanon.) In fact, the earliest such case to excite widespreadinterest was that of Shanti Devi, a girl born in Delhi in 1926. At the age ofseven she told her mother she had been alive before, in a town called Muttra.She talked about her previous home, her husband and her three children. When shewas nine, she recognized a stranger who came to their house as her husband’scousin. The man was from Muttra, and confirmed that his cousin’s wife, a girlcalled Ludgi, had died ten years earlier. When the husband came to the house,Shanti Devi flung herself into his arms. Taken to Muttra, she recognized friendsand relatives, and showed detailed knowledge of Ludgi’s life. But she failed torecognize Ludgi’s youngest child, whose birth had cost Ludgi her life.I have had the opportunity to investigate personally only two cases of allegedreincarnation. One of these I have described in some detail elsewhere;[3] theother is sufficiently typical to be worth describing here.In 1978, a Liverpool hypnotist named Joe Keeton was studying “hypnoticregression”—the tendency of some people under hypnosis to recall “previousexistences.” Under hypnosis, a young nurse named Pauline McKay asserted that shewas a girl called Kitty Jay, who had committed suicide near Chagford, in Devon.Joe Keeton made enquiries through librarians in the west country, and wasstartled to discover that Kitty Jay was a real person. “Jay’s grave” lies on theedge of Dartmoor, not far from the village of Manaton. (Conan Doyle set hisHound of the Baskervilles in this area.) In the late eighteenth century—theexact date has not been preserved—an orphan named Kitty Jay went to work at FordFarm, Manaton, as a milkmaid. She became pregnant, and committed suicide byhanging in the barn of the nearby farm of Canna. As a suicide, she was buried ata crossroad not far away—suicides were buried at crossroads to confuse thespirit with a choice of ways and prevent it from haunting the site of its death.The case came to the attention of Westward Television, and I was asked if Iwould be present on a program with Joe Keeton and Pauline McKay.Pauline proved to be a pretty, dark-haired girl in her early twenties; JoeKeeton is a big, bespectacled north countryman in his fifties. In the studio, wewere shown his letter to a local librarian and the librarian’s reply about KittyJay. Then Pauline was settled in a reclining chair in front of the cameras, andJoe talked to her softly until her eyes closed. First of all, Joe regressedPauline to her own childhood, asking her about her third birthday and what shehad done; it was astonishing to see the nurse suddenly “become” a little girl.If she was faking, she must have been a first-class actress.Joe then took her further back into the past, until she said her name was KittyJay. Questioned by the interviewer, Kay Avila, Kitty said she was ten years oldand lived in a big house near “Chagiford” (the old local pronunciation ofChagford)—apparently the orphanage or local poor-house. Taken forward to herfifteenth birthday, she said she was now working on a farm near Manaton, for amaster named Thomas. She mentioned a cook called Maudie and a man named Rob whoworked at nearby Canna Farm. She told how she and Rob sometimes went for walks“to the stones” (the area has many standing stones), and to a bridge; pressedfor the name of this bridge, she said Fingle, and named the river as theTeign—both identifications being correct.Taken forward again, she said she had now run away from the farm—apparently atRob’s instigation—and was living in a remote cottage that seemed to have nofurniture. She was very hungry—Rob had promised to stay with her, and to keepher supplied with food, but had not kept either promise. She said her stomachhurt, but it was not clear whether this was hunger, or pains connected withpregnancy. Asked to describe Rob’s last visit to her, she made it clear that hehad insisted on making her lie on the floor to have sex, and that she objected.Finally, Keeton took her forward to her suicide on Canna Farm—she had obviouslygone there hoping to see Rob; it was late afternoon. Her misery and despair werepainful to watch, as she described her decision to kill herself. As she began tochoke and gasp, Joe soothed her, then woke her up.The whole thing was astonishingly convincing—doubly so, since Pauline had nevervisited the west country before, and had only traveled down that morning.Admittedly, there were a few features that were unsatisfactory. She had no ideaof the year—except that it was “seventeen something”—or whether there was a kingor queen on the throne. But for an illiterate orphan, perhaps this is notsurprising. She did not know the surname of her master, and she refused to nameFord Farm (although it seemed that her reason was fear in case the questionerwanted to go and talk to her master). When, later in the day, we took Pauline toFord Farm and Canna Farm, she did not seem to recognize either. On the otherhand, Pauline was quite definite about never having heard of Chagford or KittyJay. And since the legend is not widely known outside the area, this seemsplausible enough.Joe Keeton, who has regressed many people into “previous lives” (some of whichare described in his book Encounters with the Past), says that he is notnecessarily convinced that this is reincarnation—that it could be some kind ofpersistent memory from a forebear, freakishly carried in the genes. But sinceKitty died with her unborn child inside her, this theory hardly seems applicableto the present case.So we must admit that, while Kardec’s assertions about spirits and the spiritworld would be totally unacceptable to a scientific investigator, they make astrong appeal to common sense, particularly in the light of the evidence about“possession” and reincarnation. Without being too dogmatic, we can say thatthere is a great deal of evidence that personality is more than a “summation ofbrain reflexes.” (Most parents have noticed that their children seem to be bornwith the personalities they possess for the rest of their lives.)This still leaves us confronted with the mystery of the nature of personality.While cases like Mary Roff and Jasbir Lal Jat suggest “possession” by another“spirit,” Mary Reynolds and Louis Vivé seem altogether simpler: their “secondarypersonalities” seem to be merely undeveloped aspects of the “normal”personality. One more example will make this very clear.In 1917, various acquaintances of a foreman named Naylor began receiving obsceneletters signed “May Naylor,” the name of his daughter. A typical letteraddressed to a Mr. Thomas—at the electric company where Naylor and he bothworked—stated: “This is to tell you that your Mrs. Thomas came to our house onSaturday. That pig Naylor took her up to the bedroom and then he . . .” Theremainder of the letter described various perverted sexual practices in explicitdetail and with obscene language. Two more men at the same company received asimilar letter at the same time. All were scrawled in the same childish hand andsigned“May Naylor.”But Naylor’s daughter May was a sweet-tempered, inoffensive child of nine whoseemed quite incapable of writing such letters.The psychologist Cyril Burt investigated the case, and found May to be anintelligent little girl, her mental age more than a year beyond her actual age.Her teachers, both at day school and Sunday school, insisted that she would beincapable of writing the letters. But Burt was convinced otherwise. Naylor hadbeen married twice, and May was the child of the first marriage. He had divorcedhis first wife for repeated sexual misconduct. May committed many of the samespelling mistakes that were revealed in the letters. She told Burt that herfavorite flower was lily of the valley—because it was so “white and pure andclean,” which arousedhis suspicions.May allowed herself to be placed under hypnosis, and was soon openly admittingwriting the letters. She was able to describe to Burt the contents of a letterhe had received from “May” but had not yet opened. Yet when awakened, sherepudiated with horror the idea that she had written the letters, and burst intotears—unaware that her “alter ego” had confessed to writing them. Burt says:Behind the visible May was an invisible May; and their natures were exactlyopposed. The one was frank, the other cunning; the one was affectionate, theother mean; the one was fastidiously correct and scrupulously pure, the othercoarse, revengeful and foul-mouthed. The child was in truth the nearest approachthat I have ever known at an age so young to a dual personality. She seemed tobe the living counterpart in feminine miniature of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.The cause of the “split” lay in the father’s remarriage. May had actuallywitnessed her mother having sexual intercourse with various men; yet she lovedher so much that she refused to believe any ill of her. When her fatherremarried, she deeply resented her stepmother, and resented a new baby brothereven more. While he was away during the war her father had asked her to writehim a letter every week, so now it was natural for her to pour out her hatredand resentment on paper. Occasional meetings with her own mother may have fueledthe vengefulness. One of the letters even accused her father of attemptedincest—which may just conceivably be true (Burt describes the father as aneurotic type).Burt’s treatment was to try to talk the child out of her hypnotic states—insteadof snapping his fingers—so that “May Jekyll” could actually hear “May Hyde”confessing to writing the letters. Gradually, says Burt, the barricade betweenthe two contending personalities was broken down, and they were synthesized.“May Jekyll” became rather less prim and proper, but May Hyde, “the jealous andvindictive letter-writer, vanished like a ghost at daybreak . . .”Here, we can see, there is no need to assume that the two personalities weredifferent “persons.” Burt’s description—“one was frank, the other cunning” andso on—makes it clear that “May Jekyll” was simply suppressing a part of herselfthat frightened her.What seems to have happened, then, was roughly this. May Naylor was a pleasant,affectionate little girl who, like all children, wanted love and security. Herfather became a soldier when she was six, and temporarily vanished from herlife; but her letters to him brought affectionate replies and—if she seemedunhappy—a visit. While her father was away, her mother slept with other men;and, since she was also an alcoholic, she made no attempt to prevent May fromseeing precisely what happened (May’s letters reveal that her knowledge ofunusual sexual practices was comparable to Krafft-Ebing’s). May herself wasgiven to masturbation. Yet all this “impurity” was a severe shock to her; sherefused to believe that her mother was “wicked” and blocked it out. She wantedto be a normal little girl with a loving mother and father; she hated beingforced into the grimy world of adults. But fate refused to allow her thesecurity she craved; her father divorced her mother and married again, and thebirth of a baby intensified her misery. Her own intense love of her father hadan incestuous element, which he may or may not have encouraged. May had beenprematurely sexually awakened—probably she took after her mother—and imaginedher father in bed with her new stepmother. It was all too much of a strain for anine-year-old girl; part of her determinedly put up the shutters against anyknowledge of sin and evil, and tried to be simply a loving and lovable child.Whatever strange mechanism produces “split personality” now came intooperation—probably some specific event triggered it—and the repressed “May Hyde”let off steam, and tried to revenge herself, by writing obscene letters. Burtsucceeded in turning May into a unified personality by allowing one May tooverhear the confessions of the other. One of the first results was that Maythen insisted on being called May Lomax—her mother’s unmarried name—and allowedher resentment to express itself openly. In due course, the two personalitiesunited—aided, no doubt, by Burt’s acceptance of her confessions, which enabled“May Jekyll” to come to terms with her own urges.The problem here can be seen clearly: like Peter Pan, May Naylor refused to growup; she wanted to remain fixed at a stage of development that was free ofconflict. Her problems were all caused by her refusal to go forward—that is, byfear. The same thing seems to have been true of Christine Beauchamp. The shockof her mother’s death, the misery of her life with her drunken father, made herwant to retreat from life. But this desire to run away is one of the mostdangerous things we can experience, as dangerous as a driver losing his nervewhen traveling at full speed. Whether we like it or not, the only “safe” way togo is forward. In Christine’s case, there was no doubt also a perfectlylegitimate desire to escape her problems by finding a man to love and protecther—the kind of man her father should have been. Her father’s friend WilliamJones seemed to be such a man—until he got drunk and made some kind of sexualadvance to Christine. It was after this, according to the alter ego Sally, thatshe became “all queer and moony.”What happened then? We can now take our choice of two hypotheses. All thequalities that Christine had repressed—mischief, vitality, outrageousness—unitedinto a “personality complex” called Sally, who became, in effect, “ChristineHyde.” Or we may take the view that with Christine now in such precariouspossession of her own body, some “spirit” saw the opportunity to invade and takeover—as when Jasbir or Lurancy Vennum were unconscious. We may reject the“possession” explanation as too fanciful; but it fits the facts just as well asthe other.There is, however, one further aspect of the Beauchamp case that I have not sofar mentioned, and which affords a further clue. Christine and Sally were notthe only two “occupants” of the body. Under hypnosis, Morton Prince discovered athird personality, who was more mature and self-possessed than either Christineor Sally; he calls her simply “B-4.” “B-4” never claimed to be a “guardianangel,” like Doris Fischer’s “Sleeping Margaret.” But in other respects, theresemblanceseems remarkable.Moreover, these two are not the only cases in which the patient exhibited a“higher” personality. Carl Jung’s first paper, “On the Psychology and Pathologyof So-Called Occult Phenomena,” describes his cousin (whom he calls S.W.), agirl of fifteen who would go into a trance and then speak with various othervoices. One of the figures she “became” in her trances was a mature and rathersaintly personality called Ivenes, who claimed to be “the real S.W.” S.W.herself was a girl of mediocre intelligence; Ivenes was highly intelligent. Sheexplained that S.W. was only the latest of her many re-incarnations, and thatshe had been a Christian martyr in the time of Nero, a French countess called deValours (who had been burnt as a witch), a clergyman’s wife who had borne Goethean illegitimate child, and another famous psychic of the thirteenth centurycalled Friederika Hauffe, known as the Seeress of Prevorst (and the subject ofone of the most popular books of the nineteenth century).[4]Jung’s cousin died at twenty-six. Jung speculated that she had an unconsciousknowledge of her early death, and that the personality of Ivenes was an attemptto compensate for this—to grow up before her time, asit were.Jung also believed that the explanation for his cousin’s many trancepersonalities might be “possession” by spirits; but the psychologistKrafft-Ebing convinced him that the answer lay in psychiatry, probably in sex.Certainly, this sounds plausible when applied to the sexual adventures of someof her previous incarnations, which Jung describes as sounding like a typicaladolescent girl’s fantasies. But it hardly seems to explain Ivenes, “the realS.W.”Whether we regard Ivenes as “the real S.W.” or as a “spirit,” the problemremains. The evidence of the present chapter suggests that the “spiritualisticexplanation” was not as unlikely as Jung finally assumed. Jung’s description ofher trances makes it sound exactly like a medium at a séance. When the girl wokeup, she used to assert that she had been moving in a realm of spirits. SoKardec’s explanation would fit the facts. But even if we decide that Jung wasprobably correct to reject it, we are left with a mystery that cannot be reducedto terms of Freudian psychology. Jung was much impressed by themystic-philosophic system about the universe propounded by Ivenes; Jung laterread widely in “occult” philosophy and found many parallels to thesystem—particularly in the gnostics; but his fifteen-year-old cousin hadcertainly never read the gnostics.Of course, this phenomenon of a “higher” personality can be understood withoutrecourse to “occult” philosophy. Our personalities tend to be a reflection ofour environment and the people around us. A person of medium dominance, broughtup by highly dominant parents or among dominant brothers and sisters, willprobably never develop his natural degree of dominance, because it has no chanceto exercise itself. A moderately pretty girl, brought up among dazzlingly prettysisters, will think herself ugly. In these cases, it is easy to see that an areaof the personality remains “latent,” although it may need only a littleencouragement to develop. Similarly, we all know stories of mothers sitting bythe bedside of their sick children for days without sleep. The crisis calls on ahigher level of the personality. Once the crisis is over, she will probably goback to worrying about trivialities; lack of stimulus allows the personality torevert to a lower level of organization.So no one would be very surprised if an adult responded to a situation of crisisby becoming more masterful and mature; we would simply feel that he (or she) hadbeen like it all the time “really,” but had allowed the “triviality ofeverydayness” to conceal it from himself. But it seems rather more difficult tounderstand in a case like that of Jung’s cousin, or Christine Beauchamp, andwell-nigh impossible to understand in the case of Doris Fischer’s “guardianangel.”The explanation could lie in the concept that I have labeled the “ladder ofselves.”[5] As we have seen, the “selves” in cases of multiple personality oftenseem to fall into a distinct “hierarchy”: in the case of Doris, the “guardianangel” was the topmost “self,” then came-Margaret, then Doris, then “SickDoris,” then “Real Sleeping Doris.” In Christine Beauchamp there was Christineherself; then, above her, Sally; then, above her, B-4. Christine was so upsetand depressed by the death of her mother and by other problems that herpersonality ceased its normal development in her early teens. Under pleasantercircumstances, she might have developed the high spirits of Sally and thematurity and balance of B-4. And it is easy to imagine that there may have beenstill higher possible levels of personality waiting for her to develop “intothem.”This obviously applies to all human beings. As we grow up we pass through whatis virtually a series of “selves”; everyone has known the surprise of meetingat, say, fifteen, a child one last saw at the age of eight; the change may makehim or her unrecognizable. With luck, we encounter the experiences that allow usto develop our potentialities, and slowly advance up the “ladder” of selves.This ladder seems to have one peculiarity. Unlike the ordinary ladder, its sidesslope inward, so the rungs became shorter. Everyone who has been through somepersonal crisis knows that in order to develop a new level of being, we need tomake an effort of compression—we even use the phrase “pulling ourselvestogether” to express what we do when we have to achieve a higher level oforganization.This raises the obvious question: what lies at the top of the ladder? Clearly,it is a question that no one can answer. But if this theory of a hierarchy oflevels has any basis in fact, then it seems that these higher levels alreadyexist in us, before we even come to suspect their existence. In a sense, theBeethoven who wrote the last quartets was already present in the new-born baby,as an oak is latent in the acorn. But there may have been a dozen otherBeethovens waiting to be developed. The same applies to the rest of us. Fewpeople develop their obvious potentialities; but even the men and women ofgenius may be little more than undisciplined children when judged by thestandard of their latent potentialities.This whole problem of the personality and its potential is considered at lengthin one of the classics of paranormal investigation, F. W. H. Myers’ HumanPersonality and Its Survival of Bodily Death. Discussing such problems asmultiple personality, hypnotism and “possession,” Myers argues that if we are todispense with the idea of “spirit guidance” or possession, then we have to positthe notion of an entire “unconscious personality,” with its own thoughts andideas. And in an introduction in a recent edition of the book, Aldous Huxleycarries this one stage further.Is the house of the soul a mere bungalow with a cellar? Or does it have anupstairs above the ground floor of consciousness as well as a garbage-litteredbasement beneath, Freud inclined to the bungalow-with-basement viewIn other words, if the mind has an “unconscious” basement, why should it nothave a “super-conscious” attic as well—a level of the “self” above the everydayself, yet equally unknown?And this notion can lead us to a further interesting speculation. Could this“superconscious” self explain some of the phenomena of paranormal research? Theadult personality is more controlled and disciplined than that of the child, andtherefore capable of greater achievements; even Mozart could not have writtenThe Magic Flute at the age of twelve. In that case, the “superconscious” selfought to be capable of still greater achievements. Could this, conceivably,explain telepathy, “second sight,” psychokinesis, knowledge of the future? Is itconceivable that “psychics” have some kind of “short circuit” to thissuperconscious level? Psychic abilities often appear after shock or severeillness; the Dutch “clairvoyant,” Peter Hurkos, developed his curious abilitiesby falling off a ladder and fracturing his skull; when he woke up in a hospitalhe found he could read other people’s minds. Uri Geller dates the development ofhis odd powers from a severe electric shock caused by pushing his finger intothe works of his mother’s sewing machine when he was three years old.But here again, there is another possible explanation. Did Hurkos’ accident andGeller’s shock simply turn them into “mediums”—open some inner gateway to allowthem to be “invaded” by “spirits”?It would, I think, be a mistake at this stage to commit ourselves to eitherview—or to regard them as mutually exclusive. Meanwhile, let us try to extendthe field of investigation by looking at the history of the strange phenomenonknown as the poltergeist.[1]. But in 1904, a collapsing wall in the other cellar revealed a maleskeleton; a peddler’s box was found nearby.[2]. Grey Eminence, p. 208.[3]. The case of Dr. Arthur Guirdham; see my Strange Powers.[4]. See chapter 6.[5]. Mysteries, Introduction."},{"pageContent":"three [../Text/Contents.xhtml#three-anchor]Cases Ancient and ModernThere are probably over a thousand recorded instances of poltergeist haunting,and in nine cases out of ten there is a frustrating lack of detail and a drearysimilarity. Objects fly through the air, furniture waltzes around the room,crockery is smashed, bangs and crashes keep everyone awake, stones fly throughwindows. Then everything stops as suddenly as it began. The only possiblecomment, except for those unfortunate enough to be involved, would seem to be“So what?” It is the one case in ten that throws up the curious incident and,occasionally, the interesting clue; and it is mainly upon these that we shallconcentrate. It may be as well to start with one of those typical cases. Thiswas published anonymously in Harper’s Magazine in 1962. How, then, can we assumeit is true? Because it is so completely pointless.A middle-aged businessman and his wife rented a house on Cape Cod for thesummer; although it had been built nine years earlier, they were, for somereason, its first occupants. It was exceptionally isolated.The man, from internal evidence, was a publisher, and on their first night inthe house, he sat up late over a manuscript. His wife, Helen, had gone to bedearly. Suddenly his wife called: “Was that you?”She had heard a sound like someone tapping with a cane on the brick wall nearthe front door. Neither paid much attention to the incident. But the next night,as they sat in the living room, the sounds came again—exactly like a cane on thebrick wall. The husband rushed outside with a torch. As he opened the door, thetapping stopped. There was nothing to be seen.During the next few months, they heard the sound again and again—almost everynight, and always at about ten o’clock. The husband tried standing by the doorat ten; but the moment he opened it, the tapping stopped.During the second week, the man was awakened three times by noises. The firstwas a sound like a box of matches falling on the floor. He switched on the lightand looked around the room; nothing had fallen down. The second night, it was adistinct sound like a sheet of newspaper swishing the length of the room. Onceagain, there was nothing to account for it. The third night, it was a noise likea rolling pin which seemed to fall on the floor, roll across the room and cometo rest against the wall. But there was no rolling pin or anything else.Then the clicking noise began—just a clicking that came from the walls. It couldhappen in any room of the house at any time of the day or night. It happenedseveral hundred times during their four months in the house.The third week, the footsteps began. They were loud and clear, like a man inleather shoes with solid heels, tramping loudly over the wooden floor. When theywere downstairs, they came from the room above; when they were upstairs, frombelow. These happened about forty times during their four months. Helen oftenheard sounds from another room and went to look, assuming someone had come intothe house—they had made a few friends in the area. There was never anyone there.Then, in midsummer, came the noise they called “the grand piano smash.” Onenight there was a deafening crash from the garage, enough to set the housequivering. He describes it as sounding as if a grand piano had suddenly lost itslegs and fallen to the floor. Naturally, the garage—which was used to storebooks—was empty.In September, they had visitors—his lawyer, and his wife and daughter. Thelawyer was completely skeptical about the “ghost.” On the first evening, thethree women went out to an amateur theatrical and the two men stayed behind towork on a contract. The lawyer remarked: “I wish to heaven I could hear fromyour precious ghost.” As they sat working, there was a crisp little click fromthe wall behind their heads. “The Universal Click?” inquired the lawyer.“Yes.”“Drying wood.”Twenty minutes later, footfalls sounded from overhead. The narrator, with aconsiderable effort of will, went on reading; the lawyer, shouted: “What onearth is that?”“Only the ghost.”“Nonsense, there’s a man upstairs.” They rushed upstairs, and the lawyer’s jawdropped when they found the room empty. He insisted on ransacking the bedroomsand attics with a torch, but found nothing.That night, the lawyer and his family slept in Helen’s large bedroom, whileHelen moved into her husband’s single room; he slept on the settee downstairs.The next morning, the lawyer asked: “What was that awful crash?” They describedthe “grand piano smash.” It had been so loud that they had thought the garageceiling had fallen in. They had been so alarmed that they had taken theirdaughter into bed between them. Yet the husband and wife had heard nothing.That is the end of the story; and it is, in all respects but one, a typicalpoltergeist story. If it had been recorded in Latin in the year 1200, it wouldno doubt read: “In a house on Cape Cod there sounded footsteps, tapping soundsand loud noises, all without apparent cause. The spirit gave no indication ofits purpose or identity.” And, in fact, this is about the amount of detail wefind in the majority of recorded cases. It can be seen why a comprehensivehistory of the poltergeist would be unreadable.The one non-typical detail is, of course, the lack of a focus or “medium.” Theauthor mentions nothing about having a child, or of any children ever being inthe house. In fact, he never mentions the word “poltergeist.” Yet this caseclearly belongs to the type of poltergeist haunting rather than to the“spectral” kind. And this, in itself, is an important clue. In ninety-ninepercent of poltergeist cases, there is a pubescent teenager—or a child—present,and it is therefore a valid assumption that what is happening is “spontaneouspsychokinesis.” One of the earliest psychical researchers, Professor CharlesRichet, reached exactly that conclusion in his huge and comprehensive ThirtyYears of Psychical Research. But if in even one percent of the cases there is nodisturbed adolescent, then the assumption becomes questionable, and we findourselves reconsidering Lombroso’s view that a poltergeist is a mischievousspirit. But where, in that case, does it get the energy?One clue may be found in a remark thrown off casually by a popular writer ontrue ghost stories, Elliott O’Donnell, who notes that Windsor Castle seems tohave an unusual number of ghosts, although no tragedies are associated with it,“an argument,” he adds, “in favor of the theory that hauntings do notnecessarily originate in tragedies . . .” Then what do they originate in? T. C.Lethbridge has already offered a clue when he speculates that ghosts and“ghouls” may be tape recordings, somehow preserved on the “energy field” ofwater. For, as a dowser, Lethbridge also observed the same powerful energyfields in the area of standing stones. He describes how, when visiting the MerryMaidens in Cornwall, he placed one hand on a stone and held a pendulum in theother, and felt an electrical tingling in his fingers, while the pendulum beganto revolve like an airplane propeller. Lethbridge also notes that most “sacredsites” seem to have been used continuously down the centuries—so that, forexample, a pagan sacred site may later become the location for a monastery, andlater perhaps of a modern church. (More often than not, such churches are namedafter Saint Michael, who seems to be the Christian equivalent of the pagan sungod, to whom most ancient sites were dedicated.) And he observed in such placesa powerful force of earth magnetism.This same conclusion was reached by a retired solicitor named Guy Underwood, whodecided to devote his retirement to studying dowsing. Underwood was convincedthat at the center of most sacred sites—such as Stonehenge or the MerryMaidens—there is an underground spring, which seems to create a pattern ofspiral lines of force around it. He also found straight lines of force passingthrough these sites, and often continuing for miles; these lines of force hecalled “holy lines.”Now Underwood’s “holy lines” had already been observed more than a quarter of acentury before he began his investigations by another lover of the countryside,Alfred Watkins, a retired brewer. But Watkins did not discover them with adowsing rod. He simply noticed that the English countryside seems to be coveredwith “long straight tracks” which pass through sacred sites; he began byassuming that they were ancient trade routes, and only laterconcluded—tentatively—that they might have had some religious significance forour remote ancestors. He called them “ley lines,” from the word “lea”; meaning ameadow. As a result of Watkins’ researches, documented in his book The OldStraight Track (1925), a club of enthusiasts began searching for these lines allover England. But after Underwood, it began to strike “ley hunters”—chief amongwhom was a young Englishman named John Michell—that ley lines are, in fact,lines of “earth force.”A new generation of “ley hunters” soon noticed another interesting thing aboutley lines—that a remarkable number of reputed hauntings, poltergeist occurrencesand sightings of “unidentified flying objects” seemed to happen on them,particularly at the crossing point of one or more “leys.”One of the oddest types of haunting sounds so preposterous that it is hard totake seriously; yet it has been convincingly documented: the repetition ofhistorical events. At Edgehill, in Warwickshire, where one of the great battlesof the English Civil War was fought, local residents heard all the sounds of thebattle some months later. It happened so often that King Charles the First senta commission to investigate; they testified on oath to having witnessed thephantom battle. The sounds are still heard today, and have been documented bythe Reverend John Dening. Near Wroxham, in the Norfolk Broads, a phantom army ofRoman soldiers has been recorded by a number of witnesses over the years, and ina cellar in York, a Roman legion has been witnessed marching by modern workmen(one of whom described his experience on the BBC’s Spotlight program). Aninvestigator named Stephen Jenkins had a similar experience on a track nearMounts Bay in Cornwall—an optical illusion of a crowd of armed men among thebushes in the evening light. Many years later, when he had discovered theexistence of ley lines, Jenkins realized that the track he had been followingwas a ley, and that he had been approaching a nodal point—a crossing with otherleys.The possibility that begins to emerge, then, is connected with our earlierspeculation that “human electric batteries” and “poltergeist mediums” likeEsther Cox may derive their power from the earth: it is that poltergeists mayalso, under certain conditions, obtain their energy from the earth; and theseconditions may be fulfilled on the nodal points of ley lines.In a book called The Undiscovered Country, Stephen Jenkins has cited a number ofcases that seem to support this theory. (For example, he prints a photographtaken in Pevensey Castle in 1957 that shows three strange little men—likeelves—on a heap of stones; the lady who took the photograph saw no little men;but Pevensey Castle is a nodal point of a number of ley lines.)It was Stephen Jenkins who drew my own attention to the “ley solution” to acurious case of haunting that I had presented on BBC television—-the Ardachiecase. In 1952, Mr. and Mrs. Peter McEwan rented Ardachie Lodge, on the edge ofLoch Ness, hoping to raise pigs there, and they hired a couple named MacDonaldto act as housekeepers. The McEwans had two small children—too young to raisethe suspicion that they may have been the “focus” of poltergeist phenomena. Onthe night of their arrival, the MacDonalds went to bed, but were awakened byfootsteps that came up the stairs and went into the room opposite. A few minuteslater, they again heard footsteps. They went and peeped into the room, whichthey had supposed to be unused, and found that, in fact, there was no one there.They went downstairs and asked the McEwans if the house was haunted; the McEwanssaid no, not as far as they knew. But back in the bedroom, Mrs. MacDonald wasterrified to see an old woman beckoning to her—neither her husband nor Mr.McEwan saw it. Mrs. MacDonald flatly denied that she was “psychic.” They movedinto another room; half an hour or so later they were disturbed by loud rappingnoises on the wall. They looked outside the door, and saw an old woman with alighted candle crawling along the corridor. And it was this that convinced theMcEwans that this was not mere hysteria; the previous owner of the house, a Mrs.Brewin, had been an arthritic old woman who thought the servants were stealingfrom her, so she used to crawl around on all fours at night with a candle—thiswas vouched for by various people who knew her well.The Society for Psychical Research sent two investigators. They were presentwhen there were loud knocks, after which, Mrs. MacDonald saw a woman in thedoorway. Later, there were more knocks from the wall, Mrs. MacDonald entered asemi-trance, and suddenly declared that the trouble stemmed from a tree in therose garden; this had been a favorite of Mrs. Brewin’s, and it had been allowedto die. This, said Mrs. MacDonald, was why the old woman was now trying to“communicate.” The gardener verified the tree story.The McEwans felt they had had enough and returned to London; the MacDonalds alsoleft. The house was later razed to the ground bythe army.Clearly, Mrs. MacDonald was, without knowing it, a “medium.” As the “haunting”progressed, she became more and more aware of her powers, and at one pointoffered to go into a trance for the investigators. But why did she have to waitto go to Ardachie before discovering that she was a medium? Stephen Jenkins, whosaw my presentation on television, looked at an ordnance survey map of the area,and concluded that Ardachie Lodge stood on the crossing point of four major leylines.[1] If his theory—and that of other “ley hunters”—is correct, thenArdachie had an abundance of the kind of energy needed for “spirits” to manifestthemselves, and only needed a medium to act as catalyst. The old woman, with hercurious obsession, was what Kardec calls an “earth-bound spirit,” like the ragand bone man who caused the poltergeist disturbances in the Rue des Noyers. Shehad been an “obsessive” in life, and continued to be so after her death. Kardecwould probably have made some attempt to help the “spirit” to evolve and escapeits earth-bound existence.What is being suggested, then, is that a poltergeist and a “ghost” are notbasically dissimilar in nature. Both need energy to manifest themselves. (One ofthe commonest features of hauntings is a sudden feeling of coldness in the room,as if the “spirit” is using up energy.) Some of this energy is taken from the“medium” or focus; but some comes from the place itself, which may be why manyhouses remain haunted over many years.The earliest records of hauntings are unfortunately lacking in detail, and soobviously “touched up” by their authors, that they can only be taken as evidencethat something out of the ordinary occurred. Probably the earliest account of aghost on record is to be found in a letter of the Roman orator Pliny the Younger(first century a.d.), who tells of a haunted house in Athens where the spiritrattled chains. As the years went past, the house fell into disrepair, until thephilosopher Athenodorus noticed it and thought that he might be able to rent itcheaply. The owners asked a remarkably low price, and told him frankly that itwas haunted. Athenodorus was not bothered. On his first evening in the house hebecame so absorbed in his work that he forgot all about the ghost. Then he heardrattling chains, and looked up to see the old man with a tangled beard and heavyfetters. The ghost was beckoning with its finger. The philosopher was tooabsorbed to pay much attention, but the noise of the chains finally forced himto get up and follow it. The ghost led him into the garden, and vanished in themidst of a clump of shrubs. Digging at this point revealed a skeleton with theshackles still on its wrists and ankles. When this was given proper burialrites, says Pliny, the haunting ceased.It seems unlikely that even a Stoic philosopher would go on working when a ghostwas trying to attract his attention; but—this obvious exaggeration apart—thestory fits the pattern of many better documented hauntings; the old lady ofArdachie seems to have behaved in much the same manner.One of the earliest poltergeist stories on record also has many typicalfeatures; it is to be found in a chronicle called the Annales Fuldenses, and theevent it describes dates back to 858 b.c. It took place in a farmhouse nearBingen, on the Rhine, where the farmer lived with his wife and children (hisname is not given). The chronicle says that the “evil spirit” made itselfevident “at first by throwing stones; then it made the place dangerous byshaking the walls, as though the men of that place were striking them withhammers.” Stone throwing is perhaps the most typical of all poltergeist antics,as we shall see; the shaking of the walls as if beaten with hammers sounds notunlike the “grand piano smash” of the Cape Cod haunting. In fact, in manypoltergeist cases, the occupants of the house are convinced that the place mustbe severely damaged, from the violence of the blows; but this seldom happens.In the Bingen case, it seems that the farmer himself was the object of themalice of the “spirit.” Apparently it followed him around—an unusual featureexcept in cases (like that of Esther Cox) where the “focus” or medium moveselsewhere—until his neighbors were afraid to receive him into their homes. Thespirit also caused fires, burning his crops (presumably of corn) soon after theywere gathered. And the poltergeist developed a voice—another unusual feature—anddenounced the man for various sins, including sleeping with the daughter of theforeman or overseer. Finally, the Bishop of Mainz sent priests with holy relics,who also heard the voice denouncing the man for adultery. In a version of thesame case, quoted in the Golden Legend, it is recounted that when the priestssprinkled holy water and sang hymns, the spirit hurled stones at them—anotherhighly convincing touch. But the version in the Golden Legend adds that thespirit proved to be the “familiar” of a priest, who had also committed adultery.Neither version mentions whether it was “exorcised”—a reliable indication thatit was not, since ecclesiastical writers never failed to emphasize the successesof Holy Church against spirits and demons.The most interesting thing about this story is its obvious authenticity, whichhas survived the usual exaggeration of the scribe. Stone throwing, deafeninghammering noises, spontaneous fires, contempt for the exorcists—all these aretypical of poltergeists, as can be seen if we compare it with a far betterdocumented case of the late nineteenth century. This also occurred on a farm, inthe province of Quebec in Canada; the owner was called Dagg.The disturbances began quietly, which again seems typical—the poltergeist seemsto begin by trying out its powers on a small scale. On the morning of September15, 1889, a boy named Dean, who was working as a “chore boy” for the Daggs, camedown early to light the fire, and saw a five-dollar bill on the floor; he tookthis up to the farmer, George Dagg, who recognized it as a bill he had given tohis wife the day before, together with another two dollars. She had placed themin a bureau drawer, from which they were now found to be missing. When the boywas out milking, George Dagg searched his room, and found the two dollars in hisbed. Later that day, Mrs. Dagg found a streak of filth—presumably ordure—acrossthe floor of the house, which so enraged her that she ordered the boy to leave.He protested his innocence. George Dagg took him off to a nearby town to see themagistrate; but while they were away, more streaks of filth appeared around thehouse, effectively vindicating the boy.From then on, poltergeist disturbances were continuous. Milk pans wereoverturned, windows smashed, small fires started, water poured on to the floor.The “focus” seemed to be an eleven-year-old Scots girl called Dinah McLean, anorphan who had been adopted by the Dagg family. One day soon after thedisturbances began, her braid of hair was tugged so violently that she screamed.It was found to be partly cut, so that it had to be completely severed. The“spirit” made a habit of attacking Dinah. And she was soon reporting that shecould hear its voice, although no one else seemed to be able to.An artist named Woodcock came to the house in November, and asked Dinahquestions about the “haunting.” She said she had seen something in a woodshed,so Woodcock got her to take him there. In the woodshed, Dinah said: “Are youthere mister?” and to Woodcock’s amazement, a gruff voice replied with someviolent obscenities (another characteristic of the rare examples of the “talkingpoltergeist”). Woodcock describes it as being like the voice of an old man whichsounded from the air a few feet away from him. When Woodcock asked “Who areyou?”’ the answer came: “I am the devil. I’ll have you in my clutches. Get outof this or I’ll break your neck.”But Woodcock refused to be intimidated; so did George Dagg, who was called in.An immensely long conversation ensued, and the “devil” gradually became lessfoul-mouthed and abusive. When Dagg asked: “Why have you been bothering me andmy family,” it replied: “Justfor fun.”Dagg responded that it wasn’t much fun setting the place on fire, to which camethe significant reply: “I didn’t. The fires always came in the daytime and whereyou could see them.” And again, when Dagg asked why it had thrown a stone whichhad hit his four-year-old child Mary, he got the answer: “Poor wee Mary. Ididn’t intend to hit her. I intended it for Dinah. But I didn’t let it hurther.” Again and again poltergeists do things that could kill or cause severedamage; yet in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, no one is actually harmed.People may even be beaten with what sound like terrible blows—yet they arehardly hurt.After more conversation, the spirit declared that it would take its leave of thehouse the following day, a Sunday. When this news spread around the area, peoplebegan to crowd into the farmhouse. The poltergeist did not let them down; assoon as they began to arrive, it was there, making comments. Like the originalHydesville poltergeist in the home of the Fox sisters, it seemed to haveintimate knowledge of the people who came in, and of their private affairs. Thevoice was still the same as on the previous day; but when someone remarked onthe improvement in its language, it replied that it was not the same spirit, butan angel sent from God “to drive away that fellow.” But this seems to have beenuntrue, for it ended by contradicting itself, then lost its temper, and usedsome of the old bad language.Woodcock took the opportunity of many witnesses to draw up a lengthy report,stating that they had seen fires break out spontaneously, stones thrown byinvisible hands, a mouth organ apparently playing itself, and all kinds ofmischievous and generally upsetting phenomena. This statement goes on to saythat the “entity” had claimed to be a discarnated spirit who had died twentyyears previously; it actually gave its name, but asked that this should be kepta secret. The spirit was able to make itself visible to thechildren—two-year-old John, four-year-old Mary, and Dinah. It had appeared tothem at various times as a tall, thin man with a cow’s head, horns and clovenhoof, as a big black dog, and as a beautiful man dressed in white robes with astarry crown. This statement was signed by seventeen witnesses.On Sunday evening, Woodcock left the house to go back to his own lodgings; butthe crowd found the spook so interesting that they begged it to stay on until 3a.m. By this time it had ceased to speak in a gruff voice and began to singhymns in a pleasant, flute-like voice. In the early hours of Monday morning, thespirit took its leave, but said it would show itself again to the childrenbefore it left permanently.The next morning the children rushed in in great excitement. They claimed thatthe beautiful man in white robes had appeared in the yard, and had picked upMary and Johnny in his arms, declaring that Johnny was a fine little fellow. Theman then remarked that “that fellow Woodcock” thought he was not an angel, buthe would show that he was. Whereupon, he ascended into the air, and disappeared.The children all told the same story, and repeated it word for word many times.Father Herbert Thurston, who has summarized the story in his book Ghosts andPoltergeists,[2] comments that the ghost’s ability to appear to the childrenmust have been some form of telepathy, and mentions that this has happened inmany other cases—that the poltergeist has been seen by children, though not byadults.The Dagg case parallels the Bingen case of 858 a.d. with remarkable closeness,even to the attitude of the neighbors, who in both cases became hostile andsuspicious, believing that witchcraft or magic was at the bottom of it. Bothpoltergeists set fires, both spoke and identified themselves. These parallelsmake it clear that, for all its amazing features, the report in the AnnalesFuldenses is probably basically accurate.It must also be acknowledged that the behavior of the poltergeist seems tosupport the assertions of Kardec. According to The Spirits’ Book, the aim of allspirits is to evolve, and they may choose freely how they do this. The spirit inthe Daggs’ farmhouse sounds very much like an ordinary human being withdestructive or criminal tendencies. He commits all kinds of mischief andgenerally torments people—although he never actually does physical damage tothem; he uses filthy language and sounds thoroughly resentful. He tells Woodcockthat he is the devil, and actually appears to the children with a cow’s head andcloven hoof. Yet in the course of a long conversation, he moderates hislanguage, pleads that he never meant to hurt anyone, and ends by promising togo. Having set himself up as an angel, he loses his temper and gives himselfaway; yet his last appearance seems to be an effort to leave behind a goodimpression of himself. All this makes him sound like a mischievous butfundamentally good-natured juvenile delinquent. Superior spirits do not,says Kardec,amuse themselves with playing ill-natured tricks, any more than grave andserious men do. We have often made spirits of this disorderly nature come to us,and have questioned them as to the motives of their misbehavior. The majority ofthem seem to have no other object than amusing themselves, and to be ratherreckless than wicked . . .This is an interesting and important point, which seems to offer an insight into“the mind of the poltergeist.” Human beings who lack a sense of purpose maybehave very badly; they may lie and steal, not out of real criminality, but outof a kind of boredom. Their lying is an attempt to impress people, and they wantto impress because they lack a sense of purpose, a personal center of gravity.As soon as such a person achieves a sense of purpose, he or she ceases to bebadly behaved. In that sense, poltergeists seem to be much like human beings.This is all the more puzzling because in other respects they seem to have veryunusual powers. For example, they seem to know a great deal about the peoplethey are dealing with. There is a case recorded by the Welsh writer GiraldusCambrensis in 1191 in which “foul spirits” performed all the usual poltergeisttricks—throwing lumps of dirt, tearing clothes, opening doors.But what was stranger still, in Stephen’s house the spirit used to talk withmen, and when people bandied words with it, as many did in mockery, it taxedthem with all the things they had done in their lives which they were leastwilling should be known or spoken about.It took pleasure in causing dismay and embarrassment. In many respects,poltergeists behave like the traditional mischievous elves or goblins, and (aswe shall see in a later chapter), there is a distinct possibility that thegoblins and fairies of folk lore may be more than the spirits of dead humanbeings. The earliest case of “mediumistic phenomena” dates back to 1524. Sometime in the early 1520s, a pretty nun named Alix de Telieux became bored withthe dull life of the convent of St. Pierre, in Lyon, and ran away with somestolen jewels. She seems to have found the world harder than she bargained for,and died in misery in 1524. It was in this year that another sister namedAnthoinette de Grolée, a girl of eighteen, woke up with a vague impression thatsomeone had kissed her on the lips and made the sign of the cross over her head.She sat up, and heard rapping noises that seemed to come from under the floor.As the disturbances continued, various people were called in to witness them,including Adrien de Montalembert, almoner to Francis I. By this time, someonehad tried asking the spirit questions, and it replied by means of a code ofraps. In this way, they had discovered that it was the dead Alix de Telieux,whose spirit was earth-bound as a result of her misdemeanors. She was able totell them where she was buried; the body was brought back to the convent andburied there. This does not seem to have put an end to the “haunting.”Anthoinette de Grolée was evidently able to provide it with the energy it neededto express itself. In death, the spirit of Alix was apparently as restless as inlife, and made Anthoinette’s life something of a misery. Montalembert himselfspoke to the spirit, and had his questions answered by means of raps, and headds that it was able to answer questions whose answer was not known to anyother mortal creature. He also reports that Anthoinette de Grolée was made tolevitate up into the air by the spirit. Finally, according to Montalembert, thedead girl actually appeared to Anthoinette and said she intended to depart. Atmatins that day there were loud rappings and other disturbances. But that washer final appearance.All this sounds like an invention of superstitious nuns who believed in evilspirits. But at the end of the printed account of Montalembert, a nun of thefollowing century has noted that in 1630 she had heard the story from an old nunof ninety-four, who had the story from her aunt, another nun. Montalembert givesan eye-witness account of the phenomena, and mentions that the case was studiedby Cardinal Tencin, who found the manuscript in the Abbey of St. Pierre. AndrewLang, who tells the story[3], says that it has “an agreeable air of good faith.”He also points out that Montalembert and the other investigators establishedcommunication with the spirit by rapping, about three hundred years before thecase of the Fox sisters inaugurated the Spiritualist movement. Then why did theearlier case fail to arouse interest in this problem of spirits and “the otherworld”? Because the nuns took it for granted that there was “another world,” andthat the spirits were either devils or souls in purgatory—like Sister Alix. Infact, one nun suffered from hysterics as a result of the uproar at matins onthat final morning, and it was automatically assumed that she was “possessed.”Three centuries later, very few educated people believed in the devil orpurgatory, so exactly the same phenomena started a world-wide movement.Yet even in these earlier times, genuine psychical phenomena sometimes led tofraud: as in the curious case of Johannes Jetzer, which took place some twentyyears earlier than the Alix de Telieux case. Jetzer was a poverty-stricken youngman from Zurzach in Switzerland, who managed to get himself accepted into themonastery of the Dominicans at Berne in 1506. From the evidence, it is now clearthat Jetzer was simply a natural “medium.” He complained that his rest at nightwas disturbed by a ghost, dressed as a brother, which kept pulling the clothesoff his bed—another favorite activity of poltergeists. This specter was able tospeak, and declared that it was suffering because of its sins; it also had ablack face and hands. (Talking poltergeists are fairly rare, yet there are anumber of cases on record, including the recent case of the Enfield poltergeist;the tape recordings of this spirit sound oddly hoarse and breathless, as if thevoice is not being produced in the normal way by vocal cords and lungs.) Theprior of the monastery seems to have assumed that Jetzer must be exceptionallyholy if he was able to see spirits—an illogical assumption—and he was sooninitiated into the Order. Nevertheless, the disturbances did not cease; on thecontrary, they became more violent. Bangs and raps resounded through the priory,keeping everyone awake at night. Jetzer also lost a good deal of sleep, andbecame increasingly alarmed as the phantom appeared in a kind of sheet of flame,asking for masses to be said for its soul. They decided to place some holyrelics in the cell next to Jetzer’s. This seems to have provoked the spirit toviolence: a huge stone fell out of the air, and doors opened and closed all overthe monastery. While all this was happening, the spirit again appeared to Jetzerand announced itself as a former prior, Heinrich Kalpurg, who had died a hundredand sixty years earlier. He had been forced to leave the monastery because ofinefficiency in managing its affairs, and had been murdered in Paris. The spiritallowed Jetzer to see its face at close quarters, and he saw that the ears andnose were missing—cut off when he was murdered. The spirit touched Jetzer’shand, and caused acute pain in his finger, which persisted for a long timeafterwards.Monks who had listened behind the doors verified all that Jetzer described. Andthe spirit continued to pay visits, heralded by various poltergeistphenomena-knocks, falling stones, objects moving through the air without beingtouched. Meanwhile, masses were said. And in due course, the spirit apparentlysucceeded in achieving some kind of peace.So far, the story appears to be an accurate report of common poltergeistphenomena, which is described at length in three contemporary pamphlets.[4]But at this point, the Dominicans seem to have decided that it would be a pityto allow the spirit to take its leave. So the ghost apparently continued tovisit Jetzer in his cell. And Jetzer was requested to ask its opinion on ahighly controversial matter: whether the Virgin Mary was conceivedimmaculately—that is, born free of original sin. The Franciscans believed shewas; the Dominicans opposed this view. So Jetzer asked his ghostly visitor whichwas correct. The spirit said he wasn’t sure, but would send St. Barbara along tosettle the point. The following Friday, St. Barbara arrived, dressed in white,accompanied by two cherubim, and went off with a letter for the Virgin Mary,written by the lector of the priory. The Virgin Mary apparently accepted theinvitation it contained, and visited Jetzer’s cell, accompanied by St. Barbaraand the two cherubim. She stated authoritatively that the Dominicans were rightand the Franciscans were wrong; she was born like anybody else. After that, shereturned to Jetzer’s cell on a number of occasions, proving she was not a demonby worshipping the host, and tearing up a tract arguing the ImmaculateConception.Presumably these events spread the fame of the monastery far and wide. But theauthorities advised caution, and instructed Jetzer to ask the Virgin variousquestions, to make sure she was not an evil spirit in disguise. The Virgin seemsto have been unoffended, commenting that it was the business of men to make surethey were not deceived.Jetzer seems to have taken her at her word. The next time she appeared shesprinkled holy water on Jetzer, and then took up a holy wafer and declared shewould transform it into the true flesh of her Son. When she dropped it back onthe table it was pink. At this point, Jetzer leapt to his feet and grabbed herhand—whereupon the other holy wafer fell on to the table. And Jetzer realized,to his horror, that the Virgin was the lector, Stephan Boltzhurst, and the twoangels were the prior and subprior.This was far from the end of the matter. The next day, the lector assured Jetzerhe had been trying to test his powers of observation, and Jetzer accepted theexplanation. The Virgin came again and pierced Jetzer’s feet and one of hishands. But soon afterwards Jetzer became suspicious about a bowl of soup; hegave it to some wolf cubs, which instantly died. When the Virgin visited hiscell again, he grabbed her hand; and again recognized the subprior. When thestatue of the Virgin in the chapel began to weep tears of blood, a neighboringpriest climbed up and found they were paint.The ecclesiastical authorities decided on an investigation, and Jetzer was takenin front of a painting of the Virgin, which began to tell him what to say incourt. He saw the painting move, and experienced a sudden suspicion; pulling itaside, he found the lector there. Soon afterward St. Bernard of Clairvauxvisited Jetzer in his cell to give him more instructions; but as he was floatingout of the window, Jetzer gave him a shove, and he fell out into thecourtyard—it was the prior again. One more attempt to deceive Jetzer so enragedhim that he wounded St. Catherine of Siena in the leg with a knife, anddiscovered her to be the procurator of the monastery. Jetzer was struck in theface.At the subsequent investigation, it looked at first as if Jetzer intended toprotect his colleagues; then he asked the protection of the bishop and told thewhole story. He was unfrocked. At a subsequent trial, the four miscreants—thelector, prior, subprior and procurator—confessed in full, after torture, andwere burned. Jetzer became a tailor and died in his native village about tenyears later.What is so interesting about the Jetzer case is the ease with which we can, withhindsight, see the distinction between genuine phenomena and invention. Thelector decided to cash in on the “supernatural” happenings. But his notion ofthe supernatural was based on absurd misconceptions. We can see that Jetzer wassimply a “medium,” and that the spirit was glad to find someone through whom itcould express its problems. It may or may not have been the person it claimed tobe—we know spirits are liars more often than not (at least, those that seem tomanifest at séances). The lector’s head was full of ideas about souls inpurgatory, saints who float through the air, cherubs with wings and so on. Itlooks as if he had considerable ingenuity in devising the various effects—evenfor a modern stage designer, it would not be easy to have a “saint” floating inand out of windows. But Jetzer’s own ingenuity is perfectly obvious. E. J.Dingwall, an eminent member of the Society for Psychical Research, who discussesthe case at length, concludes that Jetzer was as much a deceiver as the others,but this seems contrary to common sense. The “ghost” produced all thepoltergeist phenomena with which we have become familiar in other cases—bangsand raps, falling stones, slamming doors. But we must bear in mind that theywere not familiar in the sixteenth century, when very few poltergeist cases wereon record, and when the few that were were generally confused with theactivities of the devil. Shakespeare thought that ghosts go marching around theplace, glowing with phosphorescent fires, and delivering long orations; that wasthe general opinion of his time. If Shakespeare’s ghosts made rapping noises andthrew stones, we would know that he had had some first-hand experience ofpoltergeists. The case of Jetzer, like that of the Bingen spook, has all themarks of authenticity.So far we have spoken only of “mischievous” spirits that seem to intend no oneany harm—as Giraldus Cambrensis says of the Pembrokeshire poltergeist, it seemedto intend “to deride rather than to do bodily injury.” They may occasionally getangry if provoked or treated with contempt—a Mâcon poltergeist of 1612 becameirritable when someone tried to exorcise it with the words “depart, thou cursed,into everlasting fire,” and replied: “Thou liest—I am not cursed . . .” Thepoltergeist in the Enfield case (which will be described in chapter 6) hit aphotographer on the forehead with a Lego brick, and caused a bump that was stillthere a week later. But such damage is rare; more typical is the behavior of theMünchof poltergeist of 1818:[5]As the three stood conversing . . . a big iron spoon suddenly left the shelf onwhich it was lying and came straight at Koppbauer’s head. Weighing about a poundand travelling with great velocity, it might have been expected to inflict aserious bruise, but the stricken man declared that he felt only a light touchand the spoon dropped perpendicularly at his feet.Yet there have been cases where the poltergeist has shown a remarkable degree ofmalice, and caused injury as well as discomfort—Guy Playfair even mentions aBrazilian case in which the unfortunate girl who acted as the “focus” was drivento suicide.[6] And in one of the most astonishing cases on record, thepoltergeist ill-treated its victim until he died, then proclaimed itselfdelighted at his death. This is the extraordinary case known as the Bell Witch.The case, as Nandor Fodor[7] points out, took place at an interesting time whenAmericans had ceased to believe in witchcraft, and had not yet discoveredSpiritualism. As a result, there was no proper investigation. It is fortunatethat the records that have survived are so detailed.In 1817, a farmer named John Bell lived with his family in Robertson County,Tennessee, with his wife Lucy and nine children. One of these, Betsy, was a girlof twelve.At first, the disturbances were so slight that no one paid much attention. Therewere knocking and scraping noises, and sounds like rats gnawing inside thewalls. As usual, nothing could be found to account for these sounds. They seemedto be mostly the kind of noises that might be made by animals, and so did notcause a great deal of excitement. An invisible dog seemed to be clawing at thefloor, an invisible bird flapped against the ceiling, then two chained dogssounded as if they were having a fight. When lamps were lit and people got outof bed to search, the noises stopped—poltergeists seem to have an odd dislike ofbeing observed. Then the entity started pulling the clothes off the beds, andmaking various “human” noises—choking and gulping sounds followed by a gaspingnoise as if someone was being strangled. Next, stones were thrown and chairsturned upside down. Slowly, the poltergeist began to get into its stride. Thegirl Betsy—Elizabeth—seemed to be the focus; things only happened when she wasaround.When the disturbances had been going on for roughly a year, the household was inpermanent chaos. They seldom got a good night’s sleep; the house often shookwith the noises. The thing seemed to be able to be in several places at once—onenight, Richard Williams Bell was awakened by something pulling his hair so hardthat he thought the top of his head would come off; as he yelled with pain,Betsy, on the floor above, also began to scream as something pulled her hair.Like the Fox family thirty years later, the Bells decided to ask the advice ofneighbors. A friend named James Johnson came to the house. When the “ghost” madea sound like sucking air in through the teeth, he told it to be quiet, and itobeyed him. But poltergeists dislike being given orders (they seem to react bestto a friendly approach), and this one redoubled its persecution of Betsy; therewould be a sharp slapping noise and her cheek would go red from a blow, or herhair would be grabbed by an invisible hand and pulled. At least, Johnson haddiscovered that the entity understood English; so he advised Bell to invite inmore neighbors. At this stage, he still seems to have entertained the obviouslyabsurd idea that the children might be responsible. They tried sending Elizabethto stay with a neighbor; the disturbances in the Bell household stopped, butElizabeth continued to be persecuted with blows and scratches.Poltergeist phenomena always work their way up from small effects to largerones—from scratches or raps to flying stones and furniture; it never happens theother way around. The “Bell Witch” seemed to take pleasure in developing newways of upsetting everybody. Strange lights flitted about the yard after dark.As the children came home from school, stones and chunks of wood were thrown atthem. These were usually thrown from a particular thicket, and (as usual in suchcases) never hurt anyone; if the children threw them back, they were promptlythrown again. But visitors to the house received stinging slaps—as did thechildren if they tried to resist when the covers were dragged off their beds.The next stage was a whistling sound, which gradually changed to a voice.Poltergeist voices—as I have already remarked—do not sound at all like ordinaryhuman voices; at least, not to begin with. It seems as if the entity is havingto master a strange medium, to form sounds into words. (Even the rapping noisesare probably “manufactured” sounds, not genuine raps made by hard objects.) Mosttalking ghosts and poltergeists begin in a guttural voice that sounds as if itis made up from grunts or groans; the Bell Witch made gasping, whispering noisesmore like an asthmatic cough. Gradually, the voice developed until it was a lowbut audible whisper. It made such remarks as “I can’t stand the smell of anigger.” And Betsy undoubtedly provided the energy for these demonstrations; shebecame fatigued and miserable, short of breath, and subject to fainting spells.Whenever she was unconscious, the voice ceased, which led some neighbors tosuspect that she was a ventriloquist. But, as Nandor Fodor has pointed out, itsounds much more as if she slipped into mediumistic trance. At the same time,John Bell himself began to suffer. His tongue swelled, and his jaw felt stiff asif someone had pushed a stick inside his mouth, pushing on both sides of thejaw. It gradually became worse, until he was often unable to eat for a day at atime. The “witch” also seemed to direct more and more of its malice toward “oldJack Bell,” declaring that he would be tormented for the rest of his life.Meanwhile, the voice had graduated from a whisper to a normal voice; it used torepeat bits of the sermons of various local parsons. Then it began using badlanguage—again, a common characteristic of “talking ghosts.” In fact, “it”talked in several voices. One of its earliest utterances in a normal voice was:“I am a spirit who was once very happy, but have been disturbed and am nowunhappy.” And it stated that it would torment John Bell and kill him in the end.It identified itself as an Indian whose bones had been scattered, then as awitch called Old Kate Batts. Then four more voices made their appearance—the“family” of the witch; they identified themselves as Blackdog, Mathematics,Cypocryphy and Jerusalem. Blackdog had a harsh, masculine voice, Jerusalem aboy’s voice, while the other two sounded “delicate and feminine.” Theyapparently indulged in debauches, talking drunkenly and filling the house withthe smell of whisky.As much as the witch detested John Bell, it seemed to have gentler feelings forthe rest of the family, especially for John Bell’s wife Lucy. When she fell illthe witch lamented “Luce, poor Luce,” and showered hazel nuts on her. At Betsy’sbirthday party, it called “I have a surprise for you,” and materialized a basketof fruit, including oranges and bananas, which it claimed to have brought fromthe West Indies.A local “witch doctor” offered to cure Betsy with some revolting medicine whichwould make her vomit; when she duly retched, her vomit was found to be full ofbrass pins and needles. Meanwhile the witch screamed with laughter and said thatif Betsy could be made to vomit again, she would have enough pins and needles toset up a shop.One day in winter, as the children were sitting on a sledge, the witch called“Hold tight,” and hauled the sledge at great speed round the house three times.It was also able to spit; it had a particular aversion to a negro slave girlcalled Anky, and one day covered her head with a foam-like white spittle.It also showed a tendency to interfere in the personal lives of the family. Indue course, Betsy became engaged to a youth called Joshua Gardner. As soon asthe witch found out, she began to whisper: “Please, Betsy Bell, don’t haveJoshua Gardner.” Betsy finally gave in, and returned Joshua’s ring.Meanwhile, the persecution of John Bell became steadily worse. His sufferingssound like the torments of the possessed nuns and priests of Loudun; but theywere of a more physical nature. When he was ill in bed, the witch cursed andraved, using foul language. When he went outside, it followed him and jerked offhis shoes. Then he was struck in the face so hard that he was stunned and had tosit down on a log. His face began to jerk and contort—another of the witch’sfavorite methods of tormenting him—then his body convulsed. His shoes keptflying off, and every time his son Richard put them on they flew off again. Thewitch shrieked with laughter and sang derisive songs (many poltergeists haveshown themselves to be musical, although their taste seldom rises above popularsongs). Finally, the attacks ceased, and the unfortunate man sat there stunned,with the tears rolling down his cheeks. The witch had been tormenting him formore than three years. When they got him back indoors, he took to his bed. OnDecember 19, 1820, he was found to be in a deep stupor. In the medicinecupboard, his son John found a dark bottle one-third full of a smokey-lookingliquid. The witch began to exult: “It’s useless for you to try to relieve oldJack—I’ve got him this time.” Asked about the medicine the witch replied: “I putit there, and gave old Jack a dose last night while he was asleep, which fixedhim.” When the doctor arrived, they tested the “medicine” by dipping a strawinto it and allowing a drop to fall on the cat’s tongue; the cat jumped andwhirled around, then died. John Bell himself died the next day, while the witchfilled the house with shrieks of triumph, and sang “Row me up some brandy, O.”As Fodor points out, there is something very odd about this death. The witch hadoften revealed strength enough to strangle Bell, or kill him by hitting him withsome object; yet she never made any such attempt—only, as it were, drove him todespair, then administered some powerful drug when he was probably dying anyway.In most poltergeist cases we may feel that the entity is not particularlymalicious, and that this explains the lack of injury—bullying children oftenthreaten their victims with physical damage, and may even seem to be on thepoint of carrying out their threat; but there is an abyss of difference betweenthe threat—or, perhaps, lashing out with a stick and missing by a hair’sbreadth—and actually causing bodily harm. Yet the Bell Witch seems to have beenmore malicious than most. It leads to the speculation that these entities maynot be “allowed” to do actual harm; they are allowed to torment, but not todamage. This, admittedly, explains nothing; but it is certainly an observationthat has struck everyone who has studied the poltergeist.After the death of John Bell, the witch seemed to lose interest. It apparentlyrefused to help John Junior to speak to his dead father, declaring that the deadcould not be brought back; but on one occasion, it told John to go to thewindow, on a snowy day, then made footprints appear in the snow, which itclaimed to be identical with those made by his father’s boots—John did notbother to test this claim.In 1821, four years after the disturbances began (an unusually long period), thefamily was sitting at supper one evening when there was a tremendous noise inthe chimney—as if a cannon ball had rolled down it and out into the room. Itburst into a ball of smoke. The witch’s voice called: “I am going, and will begone for seven years—goodbye to all.” And the disturbances ceased.Seven years later, only Lucy Bell and two of her sons remained in the homestead;the rest, including Betsy, had married or left. Once again, the manifestationsstarted from the beginning, with scratching noises, then the covers being pulledoff the bed. But the family ignored all this, and after two weeks, themanifestations ceased. John Junior claimed that the witch paid him two visits inhis new home, and promised to return to one of his descendants in a hundred andseven years; but 1935 passed without any direct descendant of the Bell familybeing “haunted.”The case of the Bell Witch was fully documented in a book written in 1846 byRichard Bell, who had been seven when the witch first appeared, and was laterthe subject of a full length book by M. V. Ingram (1894). Nandor Fodor, who haswritten extensively on the poltergeist, discusses it fully in his book ThePoltergeist Down the Centuries. As well as being a student of the paranormal,Fodor was also a Freudian psychiatrist, and he takes the view that thepoltergeist is sexual in origin. Undoubtedly, he is partly correct—thepoltergeist seems to be at its best when it can draw on the energies of a girl(or, less often, a boy) who has just reached puberty. But Fodor goes furtherthan this, and suggests that the explanation of the Bell Witch lies in anincestuous attack made on Betsy by her father. This caused Betsy to hate herfather, and her repressed hatred expressed itself in the form of “recurrentspontaneous psychokinesis.” He also believes that John Bell felt a deep guiltabout the supposed attack, and cites an occasion when Bell went to dinner withneighbors named Dearden, yet said nothing all evening, seeming depressed andconfused; the next day he rode over specially to explain, saying that his tonguehad been affected as if his mouth had become filled with fungus. This, saysFodor, probably represents “self-aggression.”But this theory hardly stands up to examination. As we have seen, poltergeistsoften take a delight in embarrassing people by revealing their most intimatesecrets in public—in the Bell Witch case, it hastened the break-up of Betsy andJoshua by embarrassing them with personal revelations. So it is hard to see whyit should have failed to state publicly that John Bell had committed—or tried tocommit—incest with Betsy. Even if it had said so, we would be justified intreating the accusation with caution: poltergeists are not noted fortruthfulness. The fact that it failed to say so weighs heavily against theincest theory. As to the notion that Betsy’s unconscious aggressions caused thedisturbances, this fails to explain why Betsy herself was—at first—treated sobadly. It also fails to explain how the witch managed to return when Betsy hadleft home and was married.Rather more interesting are Fodor’s speculations about the nature of thepoltergeist. He thinks that its denial of communication with the dead provesthat it was not the spirit of a dead person. He is inclined to feel that thewitch was “a fragment of a living personality that has broken free in somemysterious way of some of the three-dimensional limitations of the mind of themain personality.” In other words, poltergeists are explainable as fragments ofthe “split personality.” But this leaves us exactly where we were before—incomplete ignorance of how the split personality performs its paranormal feats.The truth is that this explanation—about the unconscious mind—sounded far moreconvincing in the 1930s than it does today, when Freud is no longer regarded asinfallible. Moreover, it simply fails to fit the facts of the “haunting.” On theother hand, Kardec’s views fit them like a glove. According to The Spirits’Book, only a small proportion of the spirits involved in poltergeist cases arethose of dead people—there are many other kinds. Besides, it seems clear that inthe Bell Witch case, there was not one spirit, but several. So Kardec’sexplanation would be that the haunting in the Bell household was the work of agroup of rowdy and mischievous spirits or “elementals” of no particularintelligence—the other-worldly equivalent of a cageful of monkeys. A house withnine children, many of them teenagers, would provide plenty of the energypoltergeists find necessary to perform their antics. We must suppose that theBell household was not a particularly happy one—this deduction arises from thefact that there is no record of a poltergeist haunting taking place in a happyfamily. No doubt John Bell was a typical nineteenth-century patriarch,dictatorial and bad-tempered; and on a farmstead in a remote rural area, therewas no doubt plenty of reason for tension and frustration in the family.As to why the witch disliked John Bell so much, the reason may lie in an eventthat took place very early in the case. Before the first scratching noises wereheard, John Bell saw one day a strange, dog-like creature sitting between twocorn rows, and shot at it. The “witch” stated on a number of occasions that shecould assume the shape of an animal. Poltergeists dislike aggression againstthemselves, and if the strange animal was the witch, then it had a cause forfeeling resentment about John Bell. Apart from that, he was the head of thehousehold, the “tyrant.” If the witch was capable of showing generosity andaffection toward various members of the family—Lucy, Betsy, young John—then she(they?) would also dislike the bullying paterfamilias. This is, admittedly,speculation; but it fits better than Fodor’s Freudian guesses.It would also be interesting to have a “ley map” of Robertson Country,Tennessee, showing the Indian sacred sites, and to know whether the Bellfarmstead was situated over a blind spring or underground stream. A combinationof a house with nine children and powerful “telluric currents” would provide anideal situation for a bored and mischievous “elemental.”It is important to realize that poltergeists are one of the most common of all“psychic” manifestations: as common, say, as plane crashes, or accidents inwhich people are struck by lightning. At any given moment, there are probablydozens of cases going on in different parts of the world. Nandor Fodor beginshis study with brief summaries of about five hundred cases, starting in 355 a.d.and extending to the Douglass Deen case in 1949. Other books by researchers ofother nationalities—Richet, Lombroso, Aksakov, Bender, Roll—make it clear thatthere are hundreds more that could be added to the list.This wealth of material is actually something of an embarrassment, for mostcases are so similar that they can teach us nothing new about the poltergeist.How does it help us to know that in 1170 a.d., the hermitage of St. Godric wasbombarded with showers of stones, and that the poltergeist threw at him the boxin which he kept his altar beads and poured the communion wine over his head? Itmerely suggests what we already suspect, that poltergeists are mischievousspirits who behave very much like “demons.” More than seven hundred years later,in 1906, the poltergeist is still indulging in the same rather boring escapadeson the other side of the world, in Sumatra, when a Mr. Grottendieck was awakenedin the bedroom of a makeshift house by falling stones, which appeared to bepenetrating the roof (made of dry leaves). When he fired his rifle into thejungle, the barrage of stones only increased (another example of a poltergeistresenting aggression). His “boy” (who was presumably the “focus”) told him thatthe stones were being thrown by Satan. But in the Sumatra case, we at least haveone interesting detail. Mr. Grottendieck tried catching the stones as they fell,but they seemed to avoid his hand. He says: “It seemed to me that they changedtheir direction in the air as soon as I tried to get hold of them.” And fromthis we can make one solid inference. The stones were not “thrown.” Whateveragency caused them to fly through the air was still holding them whenGrottendieck tried to grab them. And this observation is confirmed by case aftercase in which “thrown” objects manage to perform right-angle turns in mid-air(which, interestingly enough, seems also to be a characteristic of “flyingsaucers”).So let us, in the remainder of this chapter, glance at a number of famous casesthat offer some new feature or provide a clue, and ignore all the hundreds ofothers that provide no new information. All they can tell us is that thepoltergeist is undoubtedly a reality, and that anyone who thinks otherwise—likethe eminent investigator Frank Podmore, who concluded that naughty children areresponsible—is being willfully blind or stupid.The poltergeist that appeared in the home of a Huguenot minister, M. FrancoisPerrault, in September, 1612, is remarkable solely for being one of those rarecases in which the “spirit” developed a voice and became extremely talkative.When the minister came back to Mâcon after a five-day absence on September 1,1612, he found his wife and her maid in a state of terror. The disturbances hadstarted when something drew the curtains in the middle of the night. Thefollowing night, the poltergeist pulled the blankets off the bed. When the maidtried to go into a room, something pushed on the door from the other side; andwhen she finally got in, she found that everything had been thrown about. Everynight after that, the poltergeist made loud bangs and crashes. On the night M.Perrault returned, the poltergeist hurled pots and pans around the kitchen,convincing him that he was dealing with an evil spirit. A week later, onSeptember 20, it spoke for the first time, starting with a whistling noise—asdid the Bell Witch—then repeating the words “Minister, minister” in a shrillvoice. Finally it began to sing a simple tune of five notes. Soon the spirit washolding lengthy conversations with various regular visitors to the house,singing French popular songs, saying prayers (to prove it was not a demon) andoffering to transform itself into an angel—a promise it never carried out. Italso declared thatM. Perrault’s father had been murdered, and named the man who did it. M.Perrault was inclined to disbelieve this tale, and his skepticism provedjustified as the entity invented various other malicious stories about thetownspeople of Mâcon. These strange conversations continued for two months—thespirit obviously enjoyed having an audience—and objects continued to be hurledabout. Toward the end, huge stones weighing two or three pounds were thrownabout the house—although, as usual, they caused no harm. M. Perrault states hisopinion that this was because his household was protected by God; but it seemsmore likely that the spirit simply lacked destructive tendencies.One day in November, the racket suddenly stopped. Twenty-four hours of blessedsilence made it clear that the “demon” had departed. On a nail above thefireplace hung some bells that he had often thrown about the place. The dayafter his departure, a large viper—a rare snake in that part of France—was seenleaving M. Perrault’s house, and was caught; but it proved to be a perfectlynormal snake, and presumably had nothing to do with the haunting.Perhaps the most interesting point about the Perrault case is that the maid wasgenerally believed to be a witch—perhaps because her parents had been accused ofwitchcraft. We have seen that she seemed singularly unafraid of thepoltergeist—few people would try to force their way through a door when someinvisible presence was trying to hold it closed. The spirit obviously liked her,and enjoyed imitating her broad patois. One day, when she complained that it hadfailed to bring her any wood, it threw down a faggot at her feet. When anothermaid came to the house and shared her bed, the poltergeist tormented thenewcomer so relentlessly that she finally had to leave.Modern writers on witchcraft take the view that it was a delusion due to peasantsuperstition. No doubt the majority of women who were burned as witches wereinnocent; but no one who has studied some of the best-known witch trials, likethe Isobel Gowdie case in Scotland, or the notorious Chambre Ardente affair inParis, can believe that all witchcraft is smoke without fire. In fact, thiswhole subject of witchcraft and magic deserves a chapter to itself.Perhaps the best-known of all poltergeist hauntings is the case that has becomeknown as the phantom drummer of Tedworth. It took place just half a centuryafter the Mâcon case, and begins on a day in mid-March 1661, when a magistratenamed John Mompesson was visiting the small town of Ludgershall in eastWiltshire, and became irritated by loud drumming noises that came from thestreet. He inquired what these were, and was told that they were made by avagrant named William Drury, who had been in the town for a few days. He hadtried to persuade the constable to give him public assistance, on the strengthof his papers, signed by various eminent magistrates; but the constablesuspected they were forged.Mompesson ordered the drummer to be brought before him, and examined his papers;just as the bailiff had suspected, they were forged. Mompesson seems to havebeen an officious sort of man who enjoyedexercising his authority; he ordered the drummer—a middle-aged man—to be helduntil the next sitting of the local Bench, and meanwhile confiscated his drum.The man seems to have tried hard to persuade Mompesson to return the drum, butwithout success. As soon as Mompesson’s back was turned, the constable seems tohave allowed Drury to escape. But the drum stayed behind.A few weeks later, the bailiff of Ludgershall sent the drum to Mompesson’s housein Tedworth. Mompesson was just on his way to London. When he came back he foundthe house in uproar. For three nights there had been violent knockings and rapsall over the house—both inside and out. That night, when the banging started,Mompesson leapt out of bed with a pistol and rushed to the room from which thesound was coming. It moved to another room. He tried to locate it, but it nowseemed to be coming from outside. When he got back into bed, he was able todistinguish drumbeats among the rapping noises.For the next two months, it was impossible to get to sleep until the middle ofthe night; the racket went on for at least two hours every night. It stoppedbriefly when Mrs. Mompesson was in labor, and was silent for three weeks—anindication that the spirit was mischievous rather than malicious. Then thedisturbances started up again, this time centering around Mompesson’s children.The drumbeats would sound from around their beds, and the beds were often liftedup into the air. When the children were moved up into a loft, the drummerfollowed them. The servants even began to get used to it; one manservant saw aboard move, and asked it to hand it to him; the board floated up to his hand,and a joking tug of war ensued for twenty minutes or so, until the masterordered them to stop. When the minister came to pray by the children, the spiritshowed its disrespect by being noisier than usual, and leaving behind adisgusting sulphurous smell—presumably to imply it came from Hell. Scratchingnoises sounded like huge rats.Things got worse. During the next two years lights were seen, doors slammed,unseen skirts rustled, and a Bible was burnt. The creature purred like a cat,panted like a dog, and made the coins in a man’s pocket turn black. One day,Mompesson went into the stable and found his horse lying on its back with itshind hoof jammed into its mouth; it had to be pried out with a lever. The“spirit” attacked the local blacksmith with a pair of pincers, snatched a swordfrom a guest, and grabbed a stick from a servant woman who was trying to bar itspath. The Reverend Joseph Glanvil—who wrote about the case—came to investigate,and heard the strange noises from around the children’s beds. When he went downto his horse, he found it sweating with terror, and the horse died soonafterwards.The phantom drummer seems to have developed a voice; one morning, there was abright light in the children’s room and a voice kept shouting: “A witch, awitch!”—at least a hundred times, according to Glanvil. Mompesson woke up onenight to find himself looking at a vague shape with two great staring eyes,which slowly vanished. It also developed such unpleasant habits as emptyingashes and chamber pots into the children’s beds.In 1663, William Drury was arrested at Gloucester for stealing a pig. While hewas in Gloucester jail, a Wiltshire man came to see him, and Drury asked whatwas happening in Wiltshire. When the man said “Nothing” Drury said: “What,haven’t you heard about the drumming in the house at Tedworth?” The man admittedthat he had, whereupon Drury declared: “I have plagued him, and he shall neverbe quiet until he has made me satisfaction for taking away my drum.” This,according to Glanvil, led to his being tried for a witch at Salisbury andsentenced to transportation. As soon as Drury was out of the country, peacedescended on the Mompesson household. But the drummer somehow managed to escapeand return to England—whereupon the disturbances began all over again. Mrs.Mompesson seems to have asked it—by means of raps—whether Drury was responsible,and it replied in the affirmative.How the disturbances ended is not clear—presumably they faded away, like mostpoltergeists. Certainly they had ceased by the time Glanvil published hisaccount twenty years later.The most interesting point about the case is Drury’s admission that he causedthe disturbances. This seems to fly in the face of the most popular theory ofpoltergeists—that they are the result of the unconscious disturbances of a childat puberty. If we regard Drury merely as the focus or medium, then we have toexplain how he succeeded in causing the phenomena when he was many miles away.Few writers on the case have even bothered to quote Glanvil’s remark that Druryhad been a soldier under Cromwell, and learned magic from some “Gallant Books hehad had of a wizard.” Together with Drury’s trial for witchcraft, they seem toadd a disreputable air of superstition to a case that otherwise looks like aclassic poltergeist haunting. To make sense of Drury’s admissions, we have tosuppose that (a) he knew how to practice some form of magic, and (b) that thespirit or spirits that caused the disturbances could be persuaded to help himobtain his revenge. These propositions strike a modern investigator aspreposterous. Yet, as we shall see, they fit the facts rather better than moderntheories about “recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis” or Fodor’s sexual theory ofthe origin of poltergeist activity. In her book The Night Side of Nature—aVictorian bestseller—Catherine Crowe describes a case that occurred inRambouillet in November, 1846, at a farm house belonging to a M. Bottel. Somepeddlers came to the door and asked for bread, which they were given. Later, oneof them came back and asked for more; the servant refused him, and the man wentoff uttering vague threats. That night, at supper, plates began to roll off thetable. When the servant girl happened to stand on the spot where the peddler hadstood, she was “seized with convulsions and an extraordinary rotatory motion.” Acarter standing beside her placed himself on the same spot, felt “suffocated”and dizzy, and fell into a pool of water outside the house. The curé was askedfor help, but he was “attacked in the same manner,” and his furniture began todance about. The phenomena continued for some weeks before they stopped.Here we can note a number of points of interest. Mrs. Crowe does not say so, butif the peddlers formed a group, then it seems probable they were gypsies, andgypsies have a strong magic tradition—in the nineteenth century it was studiedby a remarkable investigator, Charles Godfrey Leland. It seems curious that theservant girl was seized with convulsions on the exact spot where the peddler hadstood, and that the carter also felt dizzy and suffocated. This immediatelycalls to mind some of Lethbridge’s comments about “ghouls;” He experienced asense of dizziness and suffocation on Ladram Beach, and his wife Mina felt thesame as she stood on the clifftop at the spot where the man had committedsuicide. The French dowser Barthelemy Bléton discovered his powers when he feltsuffocated and dizzy over a powerful underground stream. It seems conceivablethat the forces involved in this type of “magic” may involve the earth. Yetsince the poltergeist also attacked the curé in his own home, we have to assumethat it was an active force—in fact, one of Kardec’s spirits.Glanvil wrote his book on strange occurrences—Saducismus Triumphatus—just beforethe dawning of the eighteenth century, the age of reason. Even in the 1660s, themagistrate Mompesson was widely suspected of somehow fabricating the story ofthe phantom drummer, and “he suffered by it in his name, in his estate, in allhis affairs . . .” A quarter of a century after its publication, Glanvil’s bookwas regarded as an absurd relic of an age of credulity. The main reason was thatthe civilized world was finally—after four centuries—shaking off the belief inwitchcraft. In England, there had been no mass trials of witches since the deathof Matthew Hopkins, the “witchfinder general,” in 1646; in America, the witchhysteria came to an end after the Salem trials in 1692. The age of science haddawned; there was no room for books like Saducismus Triumphatus in the age ofNewton and Leibniz.One of the most remarkable cases of the early eighteenth century wasinvestigated by the eminent scientist Joseph Priestley who, predictably, decidedthat the phenomena were caused by a hoaxer. It began at the rectory of Epworth,in Lincolnshire, inhabited by the family of the Reverend Samuel Wesley,grandfather of the founder of Methodism. On December 1, 1716, the Wesleys’maidservant was in the dining-room when she heard appalling groans, like someonedying. The family made a joke of it. But a few nights later, they were awakenedby loud knocking sounds, which usually seemed to come from the garret ornursery. The only person who failed to hear them was the Reverend Wesleyhimself, and the family decided not to tell him in case he thought it was anomen of his death. When they finally told him, he refused to believe them; thatnight, as if to convince him, there were nine loud knocks by his bedside.From then on, the house was in a constant state of disturbance, with footstepsin empty rooms and up and down the stairs—often more than one set of footstepsat a time—noises like smashing bottles, and a curious sound which was comparedto the “winding up of a jack” or someone planing wood. When Mrs. Wesley heardknocking noises from the nursery, she tried repeating them, and the poltergeistthen made the same knocks resound from the floorboards under her feet. When shelooked under the bed, an animal like a badger ran out. A manservant who saw theanimal sitting by the dining-room fire said it looked like a white rabbit.The family were at first afraid that it portended someone’s death, either thatof the Reverend Samuel Wesley or of his elder son (of the same name). Whennothing of the sort occurred, they decided that they were dealing withwitchcraft—against which the Reverend Samuel had preached. Yet they also noticedthat the disturbances seemed connected with the nineteen-year-old Hetty Wesley;she often trembled in her sleep before the sounds began.After two months, the poltergeist went away, although it is said to have madeoccasional brief reappearances in later years. The family came to refer to it as“Old Jeffrey.” And Mrs. Wesley remained convinced that Old Jeffrey was thespirit of her brother, who worked for the East India Company, and who vanishedwithout a trace. She could well have been right. In some respects, thepoltergeist behaved like a ghost. Its activities always seemed to begin at aquarter to ten every night (few poltergeists keep to an exact timetable)—and thevery first sounds heard were groans and heavy breathing, not the usual raps.Poltergeist disturbances usually—almost invariably—occur in a certain sequence.The earliest stage is usually some kind of scratching noise like rats; then rapsand bangs, then flying stones or other small objects, then larger objects, thenother forms of physical mischief—moving furniture, blankets pulled off beds. Ifvoices occur, they usually occur after this stage—as, for example, in the caseof the Bell Witch. It is almost unknown for phenomena to occur in a differentorder. So in that respect, the Wesley case is unusual, starting with what isusually one of the later developments. The chief objection to Mrs. Wesley’stheory is that if the spirit of her dead brother was behind the disturbances,then why did he not try to communicate—for example, when the Reverend Samueltried to get him to answer questions by means of raps?One of the more obvious features of the Epworth case is that there were none ofthe usual physical phenomena—falling stones, dancing furniture. The explanation,presumably, is that there was not enough energy available for the poltergeist todo anything more spectacular than make noises. This is also true of the mostnotorious poltergeist of the eighteenth century, the “Cock Lane ghost.” Thisbegan with knocking noises in the house of Richard Parsons, clerk of St.Sepulchre’s church in Smithfield, London, in November, 1759. One night, a womannamed Fanny Lynes, who was lodging in the house, asked ten-year-old ElizabethParsons, the eldest daughter, to sleep with her while her common-law husband wasaway on business. All went well for a few nights; then the two were kept awakeone night by scratching and rapping noises from behind the wainscot. When theytold Richard Parsons about it, he said it was probably the cobbler next door.Soon afterwards, Fanny became ill with smallpox; she was six months pregnant,and her “husband” was understandably anxious. He and Fanny were unmarried onlybecause she was his deceased wife’s sister. William Kent had married ElizabethLynes two years earlier, but she had died in childbirth; now it looked rather asif the story was repeating itself. He moved Fanny into a house nearby, where, onFebruary 2, 1760, she died of smallpox.Meanwhile, the rappings in Richard Parsons’ house were continuing; Parsonsactually called in a carpenter to take down the wainscotting, but nothing wasfound. Meanwhile, the knockings got louder, and the story of the “haunted house”spread throughout the neighborhood. They seemed to be associated with Elizabeth;they came from behind her bed, and when they were about to begin, she wouldbegin to tremble and shiver like Hetty Wesley in the Epworth case. Later thatyear, Elizabeth began to suffer from convulsions.Like so many victims of poltergeist phenomena, Richard Parsons decided to callin a friend, the Reverend John Moore, assistant preacher at St. Sepulchre’s. Andthe Reverend Moore proceeded to communicate with the “spirit,” asking it toanswer his questions in the usual manner—one rap for yes, two for no. (Theyadded a scratching noise to indicate it was displeased.)By this means the spirit told its upsetting story. It was, it declared, theghost of Fanny Lynes, returned from the dead to denounce her late “husband,”William Kent, for killing her by poison. He had, it seemed, administered redarsenic in her “purl”: a mixture of herbs and beer.Richard Parsons was not entirely displeased to hear this story, for he wasnursing a grudge against his late tenant. William Kent was a fairly rich man,having been a successful innkeeper in Norfolk, and he had lent Parsons twentypounds, on the understanding that Parsons should repay it at a pound a month.Parsons, who seems to have been a drunkard, had failed to repay anything,possibly because he had discovered that Kent and Fanny were not married, andhoped to blackmail Kent into forgetting the loan. Kent had put the matter intothe hands of his attorney.If Parsons had been less anxious to believe the worst of his ex-tenant, he mighthave suspected the ghost of untruthfulness. To begin with, the knocking hadbegun while Fanny Lynes was still alive. And a publican named Franzen swore thathe had seen a spirit in white one evening in December 1759, when Fanny had justmoved from the Cock Lane house. Parsons apparently found it easier to believethat the earlier knockings had been caused by Kent’s first wife Elizabeth—whowas presumably also trying to denounce him for murder.Throughout 1761, the house in Cock Lane acquired an increasing reputation forits ghosts, and the tale about Kent’s supposed murders gained wide currency inthe area. Kent himself heard nothing about it until January 1762, when he saw anitem in the Public Ledger about a man who had brought a young lady from Norfolkand poisoned her in London. A few days later, another item about the Cock Laneghost and its revelations led Kent to go along to see the Reverend John Moore.Moore, a respectable and well-liked man, could only advise Kent to attend aséance in Elizabeth’s bedroom, and see for himself. Kent did this, taking withhim the doctor and apothecary who had attended Fanny in her last illness. Thesmall bedroom was crowded, and Elizabeth and her younger sister lay side by sidein the bed. At first the “ghost” declined to manifest itself; but when the roomhad been emptied, Moore succeeded in persuading it, and they all trooped back.Now Kent listened with something like panic as he heard Moore asking the spiritif it was Kent’s wife—one knock—if it had been murdered by him—one knock—and ifanyone else was concerned in the murder plot—two knocks. Kent shoutedindignantly, “Thou art a lying spirit!”Now, suddenly, the ghost was famous all over London, and Cock Lane was crowdedwith carriages. In February, a clergyman named Aldrich persuaded Parsons toallow his daughter to come to his vicarage in Clerkenwell to be tested. Aninvestigating committee, including the famous Dr. Johnson, was present.Inevitably, the ghost declined to manifest itself. Nor would the ghost rap onthe coffin of Fanny Lynes in the vault of the church. Dr. Johnson concluded itwas a fraud. And this was the opinion of most of London.On the day following this fiasco, Elizabeth was staying at the house of acomb-maker in Cow Lane when the bell of Newgate Prison began to toll—a sign thatsomeone was to be hanged. The comb-maker asked the ghost whether someone wasabout to be hanged and whether it was a man or woman; the ghost answered bothquestions correctly. Later that day, a loose curtain began to spin on itsrod—the only physical manifestation in the case.The following day, as Elizabeth lay asleep, her father heard whispering noises;he carried a candle over to her bed, but she seemed to be asleep. The whisperingcontinued, although the child’s lips were plainly closed. In fact, thepoltergeist seemed to be increasing in strength. Two nights later, the noiseswere so violent that their host asked them to leave.(Presumably she was sleeping away from home to avoid crowds.) Elizabeth and herfather moved to the house of a Mr. Missiter, near Covent Garden,and the manifestations continued, even when a maid lay in bed beside Elizabethand held her hands and feet.By now, the unfortunate Kent was determined to prove his innocence through thelaw; so the burden of proof now lay on Parsons and his daughter. Elizabeth wastold that unless the ghost made itself heard that night, her father and motherwould be thrown into prison. Naturally, she made sure something happened. Theservants peered through a crack in the door, and saw her take a piece of boardand hide it in the bed. Later, when there were people in the room, the knockingnoises sounded from the bed. In fact, the listeners noticed that the knocks werecoming from the bed and not, as usual, from around the room. The bed wassearched and the board found. And the next day, the newspapers published thestory of the “fraud.”On February 25, 1762, there appeared a pamphlet entitled: The Mystery Revealed;Containing a Series of Transactions and Authentic Testimonials respecting thesupposed Cock Lane Ghost, which have been concealed from the Public—the authorwas probably Johnson’s friend Oliver Goldsmith. A satirical play called TheDrummer or the Haunted House was presented at Covent Garden. And William Kentbegan legal proceedings against Richard Parsons. In July 1762, Mr. and Mrs.Parsons, and a woman called Mary Frazer—who had often acted as “questioner” tothe ghost—appeared before magistrates in the Guildhall. Parsons was charged withtrying to take away the life of William Kent by charging him with murder. Thejudges remained unconvinced by the evidence of neighbors who had heard rapsresounding from all over the room, and who were certain that Elizabeth could nothave made them. And finally, Parsons was sentenced to two years in prison, andto stand three times in the pillory; his wife was sentenced to one year, andMary Frazer to six months. The Reverend Moore and one of his associates had topay out £588 in damages to Kent. There was universal sympathy for Parsons, andwhen he stood in the pillory, the mob took up a collection for him—an unusualgesture for a period when malefactors were often badly injured in the pillory.(Later in the year a man convicted of sodomy was stoned to death in the samepillory.)For more than two centuries, the Cock Lane ghost became a synonym for animposture. When Andrew Lang wrote about it in 1894, he began his chapter: “Ifone phantom is more discredited than another, it is the Cock Lane ghost.” Yetfor anyone studying the case today, this view seems absurd. Nothing could bemore obvious than that the Cock Lane ghost was a poltergeist like the hundredsof others that have been recorded down the ages. Unfortunately, it is now toolate for us to discover certain essential facts that might help to explain it.For example, what kind of a girl was Elizabeth Parsons? She was rather youngerthan most poltergeist-children, but she may well have been sexually mature forher age. If her father was something of a drunkard and a spendthrift—as therecords indicate—then it seems fairly certain that the Parsons household was nota happy one. The father of Christine Beauchamp—Morton Prince’s famous case ofmultiple personality—was a similar type of person, and his daughter had severepsychological problems as a consequence. We know that Christine Beauchamp becamefixated on her father’s closest friend William Jones, and transferred to him allher adoration. It is conceivable that Elizabeth Parsons felt the same aboutWilliam Kent. In which case, sleeping in his bed while he was away must havearoused morbid emotions—especially if she was aware that Kent and Fanny were“living in sin.” The convulsions that began a year after the disturbancescertainly suggest she was passing through a period of emotional upheaval. Butsince we know so little about Elizabeth, all these things must remain a matterfor speculation.Only one thing seems fairly certain: that the spirit itself was neither that ofElizabeth Kent nor of Fanny Lynes; it was the usual mischievous poltergeist,bent on creating as much havoc and confusion as possible. It seems to confirmChesterton’s remark that the only definite thing that can be said about suchspirits is that they tell lies.The Epworth poltergeist and the Cock Lane ghost confined themselves to rappings(although the Cock Lane ghost seemed to be attempting more ambitious phenomenatowards the end). A poltergeist that haunted a farm in Stockwell, London, in1772 showed altogether less restraint. It began by throwing rows of plates offthe kitchen shelf and smashing them. When the owner of the house, Mrs. Golding,fainted, the doctor bled her; the blood had only just congealed when it leaptout of the basin, and the basin smashed in pieces. When Mrs. Golding offeredsome of the assembled guests a drink of wine or rum, these bottles alsoshattered. Joints of ham leapt off their hooks on the ceiling and fell to thefloor. The racket was so tremendous that they were afraid the house would falldown, and the children were sent off to the barn. The maid, Ann Robinson, wentwith them, and as soon as she was out of the house, the disturbances stopped.The moment she returned, they started again. The coal scuttle overturned,candlesticks flew through the air, a nine-gallon cask of beer was turned upsidedown, and a bucket of cold water “boiled like a pot”—as in the Amherst case of acentury later. Mrs. Golding decided to sack the maid, and the uproar promptlyceased.This case attracted little attention at the time—if Dr. Johnson heard of it, heno doubt dismissed it as another fraud. Catherine Crowe unearthed it a centurylater for her book The Night Side of Nature. And in her chapter on thepoltergeist, she makes some sensible and pertinent suggestions. She discussesthe case of a French girl called Angélique Cottin, who was weaving silk gloveson January 15, 1846, when the loom began to jerk violently. The other girls wereterrified, and retreated to the far end of the room; then, one by one, they wentback to examine the loom, which had a heavy oak frame. As soon as Angéliqueapproached, it began to dance again.From this time on, Angélique developed the power of giving people violentelectric shocks—she was, in fact, another “human electric eel”—like thosediscussed in the previous chapter. Objects laid on her apron flew off violently,and the power was strong enough to raise a heavy tub with a man sitting on it.Oddly enough, metals were not affected, indicating that this form of“electricity” was not the usual kind. When Angélique was tired, the currentwould diminish. It also diminished when she was on a carpet, but was mostpowerful when she was on bare earth—another indication that the force seems tocome from the earth, and is probably connected with the force that convulsessome dowsers. She had to sleep on a stone covered with a cork mat. The phenomenacontinued for four months, and were widely studied by men of science; then theyceased.Mrs. Crowe makes the reasonable suggestion that poltergeist phenomena may beelectrical in nature, and cites a number of other cases, including a Mlle.Emmerich, sister of the professor of theology at Strasbourg, who became a humanelectric battery after receiving a severe fright, the nature of which is notspecified. (We have already noticed that many mediums seem to develop theirpowers after accidents.) The interesting thing about Mlle. Emmerich was that shecould give people shocks even when they were not touching her. She gave herbrother a shock when he was several rooms away; when he rushed to her bedroom,she laughed and said: “Ah, you felt it, did you?”Mrs. Crowe adds the interesting remark: “Many somnambulistic persons [she meanspersons under hypnosis] are capable of giving an electric shock; and I have metwith one person, not somnambulistic, who informs me that he has frequently beenable to do it by an effort of will.”Clearly, if someone was able to produce electric currents at will, he or shemight be in a position to cause poltergeist phenomena—perhaps even at adistance, like Mlle. Emmerich; in that case, we might have some kind ofexplanation for the magical powers of the drummer of Tedworth. But although thetheory is attractive, it could only explain the least spectacular abilities ofthe poltergeist—like causing raps and smashing plates. How, for example, couldit account for the varieties of mischief that disrupted the domestic peace ofthe Reverend Eliakim Phelps in 1850?The Reverend Phelps lived in Stratford, Connecticut, and had married a widowwith four children. He was interested in clairvoyance, and attempted to treatillnesses by means of mesmerism. He was understandably excited by the news ofthe strange events at the home of the Fox family in 1849. And in March 1850,when he entertained a visitor from New York, the two of them arranged some kindof amateur séance, which was not particularly successful, although they managedto obtain a few raps.A few days later, on Sunday, March 10, the family returned from church to findthe front door wide open and the place in disorder. Their first assumption wasthat they had been burgled; but inspection showed that nothing had been taken,and a gold watch left on a table was untouched. That afternoon, the family wentoff to church again, but this time the Reverend Phelps stayed behind to keepwatch. He may well have dozed; at all events, nothing disturbed him. But whenthe family returned from church, the place again showed signs of an intruder.Furniture was scattered, and in the main bedroom, a nightgown and chemise hadbeen laid out on the bed, with the arms folded across the breast, and a pair ofstockings placed to make it look like a corpse laid out for burial. In anotherroom, clothing and cushions had been used to make various dummies, which werearranged in a tableau, “in attitudes of extreme devotion, some with theirforeheads nearly touching the floor,” and with open Bibles in front of them.Clearly, the poltergeist had a sense of ironic humor.From then on, the Phelps poltergeist practiced its skill as a designer oftableaux. The astonishing thing was that these were done so quickly. Oneobserver, a Dr. Webster, remarked that it would have taken half a dozen womenseveral hours to construct the “dummies” that the poltergeist made withinminutes. One figure was so life-like that when the three-year-old boy went intothe room, he thought his mother was kneeling in prayer, and whispered “Be still. . .”That it was a poltergeist became clear the following day, when objects began tofly through the air. A bucket flew downstairs, an umbrella leapt through theair, and spoons, bits of tin and keys were thrown around. A candlestick jumpedoff the mantelpiece, then beat the floor violently until it broke. There wereloud pounding noises as if someone was trying to demolish the house with an axe,and loud screams.The poltergeist probably derived its strength from the fact that it had two“focuses” in the house—Harry, aged twelve, and Anna, who was sixteen. Harry waspersecuted by the “spirit.” When he went for a drive in the carriage with hisstepfather, twenty stones were flung into the carriage. On one occasion he wassnatched up into the air so that his head nearly struck the ceiling; he wasthrown into a cistern of water, and tied up and suspended from a tree. In frontof a visiting clergyman, the legs of his trousers were violently torn open fromthe bottom to above the knee.After this, the poltergeist started to break glass; it smashed seventy-onewindow panes and various glass articles. Another of its favorite tricks was towrite on sheets of paper; when the Reverend Phelps turned his back on hiswriting table, he heard the scratching of the pen, and found written on thepaper: “Very nice paper and nice ink for the devil.” (Typically, poltergeistsseem to object to being watched while they do things like this; they wait untilno one is looking.)Phelps tried communicating with the “spirit” by means of raps, and found that itwould answer his questions. There seemed to be more than one spirit present; butthe author of most of the mischief seemed to be a French clerk, who had handleda settlement for Mrs. Phelps, and who had since died; he now claimed to be inhell because he had cheated Mrs. Phelps. Her husband investigated this claim,and found that there had been a minor fraud; but it had hardly been as seriousas the “spirit” seemed to believe. On another occasion the raps told Phelps toput his hand under the table; when he did this his hand was grasped by anotherhand, warm and human.A well-known psychic named Andrew Jackson Davis visited the Phelps home, and putforward a theory very similar to that of Mrs. Crowe. He said that the phenomenawere caused by “magnetism” and by “electricity,” the magnetism attractingobjects towards the boy and girl, the electricity causing them to fly in theopposite direction. But Davis—the author of a bestselling work of “spiritdictation” called The Principles of Nature, also agreed that there were spiritspresent—he claimed to have seen five of them.The poltergeist—or poltergeists—became increasingly destructive. Pieces of paperburst into flame, although always where they could be seen; sometimes, the ashesof burnt papers were found in drawers. All kinds of objects were smashed—Phelpsestimated that the poltergeist had done about two hundred dollars’ worth ofdamage. And the poltergeist also attacked the eldest girl, Anna. A reporter wassitting with the mother and daughter when the girl shouted that someone hadpinched her; they rolled up her sleeve and found a severe fresh pinch mark onher arm. On another occasion, there was a loud smacking noise, and a red markappeared on her face.In October 1851, more than a year after the disturbances began, the mother andchildren went off to Pennsylvania and stayed there until the following spring.The poltergeist did not follow them; and when they returned to Stratford,nothing more happened.It seems fairly clear that the Reverend Phelps made a mistake in attracting theattention of spirits to his home by holding the séance; they discovered thatthere were two excellent mediums in the house, and the result was one of themost spectacular cases of poltergeist disturbance on record. The assertion byone of the “spirits”’ that he was a French clerk, now in hell, need not be takentoo seriously; another observer, the Reverend John Mitchell, also communicatedwith the “spirits” by means of raps, and received insulting replies in badlanguage. The Phelps poltergeists seem to have been the usual crowd of invisiblejuvenile delinquents.[1]. I have given more precise details of these in my book Mysteries.[2]. Light magazine for December 1889 contained a far longer account.[3]. Cock Lane and Common Sense, pp. 110–113.[4]. The story is retold by E. J. Dingwall in Very Peculiar People, 1950.[5]. Thurston, chapter III.[6]. See chapter 6.[7]. The Poltergeist Down the Centuries."},{"pageContent":"four [../Text/Contents.xhtml#four-anchor]The Black Monkof PontefractIf the Phelps haunting is the classic American poltergeist, then the classicBritish case is certainly the Black Monk of Pontefract. The strange thing isthat this remarkable case was never officially investigated—or even recorded—andthat it came so close to being forgotten. At the time it occurred—in the late1960s—it caused much local excitement and was reported in the newspapers; butwhen the haunting stopped, interest faded. Almost ten years later, a youngamateur historian—with a special interest in the Cluniac monks ofPontefract—heard about the case and decided to investigate. What he uncovered inthe local newspapers sounded almost too good to be true: poltergeist phenomenaapparently caused by the ghost of a Cluniac monk who had been hanged for rape inthe time of Henry the Eighth. The historian called on the Pritchard family, whostill lived in the house where the phenomena had taken place, and listened totheir accounts of the haunting. He talked to relatives and friends andneighbors, and to the local vicar and the mayor and the Member of Parliament whohad witnessed some of the phenomena. All this convinced him that this was morethan an interesting footnote to an essay on the Priory of St. John theEvangelist. He telephoned me, outlined the story, and suggested that it mightmake a sensational book along the lines of The Amityville Horror. I drove up toYorkshire, interviewed the witnesses, and decided that it would be pointless todramatize it; the facts themselves are already as sensational as anything in therecorded history of poltergeist hauntings.Pontefract is an ancient town that dates back to Roman times—the name means“broken bridge” in Latin. Although connected to Leeds and Doncaster by motorway,it still retains an air of belonging to the nineteenth century—the kind of placeJ. B. Priestley loves to evoke in novels like The Good Companions.If you stand outside the church of All Saints, a few yards from the ruins of theold priory and the castle, you can look across to the housing estate ofChequerfields on the opposite hilltop—the hill that was once the site of thegallows. But if you try to find your way there without a map—as I did—you arelikely to get lost in the maze of pleasant little tree-lined back streets withgrass verges and neat front gardens. Number 30 East Drive stands on a corner,and on the top of the hill, close to the site of the old gallows. It also standson the place where there was once a bridge over a small stream.In August 1966, the family at 30 East Drive consisted of Jean and Joe Pritchard,their son Phillip, aged fifteen, and their daughter Diane, twelve. During theweek of the Bank Holiday, the family went on holiday to Devon, leaving Mrs.Pritchard’s mother, Mrs. Sarah Scholes, in charge. Phillip had decided to staybehind; he had reached the age when holidays with the family lose theirattraction.Thursday was a sunny day, and Phillip took a book into the garden. Mrs. Scholessat on the settee, knitting a cardigan. She was surprised that Phillip could sitin the garden; the room struck her as unusually chilly. Then, at abouteleven-thirty, there was a sudden gust of wind that rattled all the windows andmade the back door slam. Phillip came into the house, and Mrs. Scholes said: “Isthere a wind getting up?” “No. It’s quite calm out there.”He went into the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee, and tea for hisgrandmother. Ten minutes later, he opened the door of the lounge, and stoodstaring. Mrs. Scholes was absorbed in her knitting; and all around her, floatinggently down through the air, was a grey-white powder, like chalk dust. Mrs.Scholes was so absorbed in her knitting that she had not even noticed it. Thenshe looked up, and saw Phillip through the fine white haze. She said accusingly:“What have you been up to?”“Nothing. I’ve been in the kitchen all the time. What is it?”They both looked up at the ceiling—the obvious explanation seemed to be that itswhitewash was disintegrating. In fact, the ceiling had been recently papered.And now as Phillip looked more closely, he became aware of another curious fact.The top half of the room was perfectly clear; the falling powder started on alevel below his head. And when Mrs. Scholes stood up, her own head rose abovethe top of the falling powder like an airplane above the clouds.Mrs. Scholes was in no way alarmed, merely baffled. There had to be some naturalexplanation. Perhaps it had all blown in through the window. She decided to goand consult her daughter, Marie Kelly, who lived opposite. Marie stared inastonishment as her mother came in “looking like a snowman,” and crossed theroad to the Pritchards’ home. The powder was still falling, and it had noapparent source. It now formed a fine white layer on the furniture, and on thepolished sideboard. The cup of tea which Phillip had brought in for hisgrandmother was covered with a white film. Mrs. Kelly stared at it for a fewminutes, then said: “We’d better get it cleaned up.” She went into the kitchen,and her foot skidded. There was a large pool of water on the kitchen floor. Shecalled: “Are you sure you haven’t had an accident? This place is flooded.” Theold lady said irritably: “I’m not senile yet.”’Mrs. Kelly took a floorcloth from the cupboard under the sink, and mopped up thewater. Then, as she squeezed out the cloth in the sink, she noticed another poolon the linoleum. She stooped and mopped it up. As she did so, she noticedanother patch. It took her a few seconds to grasp that new pools of water seemedto be forming as fast as she mopped them up.The obvious explanation was that the water was coming up through the linoleum.Mrs. Kelly took hold of a corner, and pulled it back. The floor underneath wasperfectly dry.Fortunately, no doubt, neither of the two women had the least idea that creatingpools of water is one of the stranger habits of the poltergeist. No one knowsquite how or why. Guy Playfair, who has investigated many cases, believes thatthe water is some kind of condensation of the energy used by the poltergeist,and his explanation is as plausible as any. The pools have one oddity; they havea neat outline, as if they had been poured on the floor from a jug heldimmediately above its surface—no splashing, and none of the bold streaks thatcome from pouring water from a height. You might almost suppose the poltergeistwas a small animal urinating on the floor. When I went to the Pritchards’ homein 1980, the first thing I asked about was the shape of the pools of water. Justas I had expected, they were rather neat little puddles.The only peculiarity about this first manifestation in East Drive was that thepoltergeist was causing a miniature snowstorm in the lounge while the pools ofwater formed in the kitchen next door. The East Drive poltergeist also playedtricks with the water supply. When the taps were turned on, and the toilet wasflushed, a greenish foam rushed out.The next-door neighbor, Enid Pritchard (married to Joe Pritchard’s brother) hadheard the commotion, and came in to see if she could help. She found thestop-cock under the sink and turned it off. It made no difference. The pools ofwater continued to appear. So Mrs. Kelly—who had to go home to make herhusband’s lunch—rang the water board and explained that number 30 was having aflood. They promised to send someone around immediately after lunch.By the time the man arrived, the powder had stopped falling in the lounge, andwith the help of a duster and a dust-pan, the place had been restored to normal.But the pools of water were still appearing on the kitchen floor. The man fromthe water board was little more than a youth, but he seemed to know hisbusiness. He lifted the linoleum and checked that the surface of the floor wasdry—this ruled out the possibility of a burst pipe under the floor. Next heexamined the drains, and poked down them with a flexible metal rod, to checkthat there were no fractures in the pipes; again, the result was negative. Thenhe came back into the kitchen, surveyed the pools of water, scratched his head,and suggested that it might be some kind of condensation, due to the clammyweather. The others were too polite to say what they thought of thissuggestion—that week had been exceptionally dry—and the man went off to reportthe problem to his superiors. And about an hour later, the pools of waterstopped appearing. Mrs. Kelly and Mrs. Pritchard returned to their respectivehomes. And Mrs. Scholes returned to her knitting.At about seven that evening, Mrs. Scholes was watching television when Phillipsaid: “Grandma, it’s happening again.”The working surface at the side of the kitchen sink was covered with sugar anddry tea leaves. And, as they watched, the button of the tea dispenser above thesink went in of its own accord, and more tea showered down. And as they gaped atit, the button went gently in and out, and tea cascaded down on to the drainingboard. It went on until the dispenser was empty; and even then, the buttoncontinued to go in and out. When Mrs. Scholes found her voice, she shouted “Stopit!” and Phillip, who thought he was being accused, said indignantly: “Ican’t—it’s doing it on its own!”As he spoke, there was a crash from the hallway. They looked at one another,both pale, wondering if the intruder was about to reveal himself. Opening thedoor was a little like a nightmare—expecting to see something horrible. But thehall beyond was empty. As they stood staring, the hall light went on with aclick, and they both jumped. They went down the corridor, to the foot of thestairs. They then saw what had made the noise. A plant that normally stood atthe foot of the stairs was now halfway up them—minus its pot. The pot was on thelanding above.Another sound made them jump. It was coming from the kitchen. They found thatthe crockery cupboard was shaking and vibrating, as if someone was locked insideand trying to get out, Phillip went and wrenched open the door. Immediately, thevibrations stopped. At the same time, another loud banging noise started upsomewhere in the house. It was not a particularly alarming noise; in fact, Mrs.Scholes had heard it a few hours earlier, and assumed that May Mountain’shusband was doing a little home carpentry on the other side of the dividingwall. Now, as she observed the sudden chill in the atmosphere, she connected itwith the other strange events. She said: “I’m going to get Marie.” And Phillipsaid: “I’ll come with you.” He had no intention of being left there alone.Mrs. Kelly went back with them, and as soon as she stepped into the kitchen, sheknew it was not her mother’s imagination. The crockery cupboard was shakingagain, and the cups and plates inside were rattling. If the cupboard had been onthe dividing wall, they might have assumed that the Pritchard’s next door weresomehow causing it. But it was on the end wall of the house—nothing beyond itbut the garden.Mrs. Scholes went next door, and asked May Mountain if she had been makingbanging noises. She looked at her in astonishment and said: “We thought it wasyou.”By the time Mrs. Scholes got back, the noises had stopped, and Marie Kelly hadmade a cup of tea. They sat and talked until nine-thirty, then Marie said she’dbetter get back home. She told them to come across the road if anything furtherhappened. But they all hoped it was over for the night.Phillip went off to bed. Mrs. Scholes decided that she needed a good night’srest, and also went upstairs. She went into Phillip’s bedroom to kiss himgoodnight. As she did so, she realized he was staring over her shoulder withwide eyes. The wardrobe in the corner of the room was tottering and swaying likea drunken man.Mrs. Scholes said: “Phillip, get dressed, quick. We’re going.”Half an hour later, they were tucked up in the spare beds in Mrs. Kelly’s house.For them this particular poltergeist episode was at an end.But Marie Kelly and her husband Vic had lost all desire for sleep. Vic Kelly hadnot bothered to go and investigate earlier, convinced that there was a naturalexplanation. Now he decided it was time to get professional advice; hetelephoned the police station, and told his story. When the police car arrivedten minutes later, Vic and Marie Kelly went out to meet them. An inspector namedTaylor was accompanied by two uniformed constables. The five of them went intonumber 30, where everything seemed normal, and the policemen began a methodicalsearch of the house. They went through every room, peered under beds, examinedwindows for signs of entry, and finally agreed that there was no sign of anintruder. They went back to the station, and the Kellys went back into their ownhome.Vic Kelly was still not happy. As he and Marie sat discussing the events, andshe again described the falling powder, the pools of water, the rattlingcupboard, Vic said: “What about your friend Mr. O’Donald? He’s interested inghosts isn’t he?”It was almost midnight, but neither of them felt like sleeping. They walked upthe street, and observed that Mr. O’Donald’s downstairs light was still on. Theyknocked on his front door and explained their problem; without hesitation, Mr.O’Donald went for his coat.From the ghost-hunter’s point of view, the situation at number 30 lookedpromising. As they entered the house, they were met by a blast of cold air—theydescribed it as like walking into a refrigerator. But now they were hoping formanifestations, the ghost refused to oblige. So they sat in the lounge, and Mr.O’Donald explained to them the distinction between ghosts and poltergeists—thatthe poltergeist was supposed to be a manifestation of someone’s unconsciousmind—in this case, probably Phillip’s.“In that case,” said Vic Kelly, “we’re wasting our time sitting here. He’s inour house.”At 1:45, Mr. O’Donald yawned, and said he agreed they were wasting their time.If it was a poltergeist, it would no doubt signal its presence on the morrow.“They do funny things. They’re very fond of tearing up photographs, I believe.”He said goodnight and left. But as Marie and Vic Kelly were about to lock thedoor behind them, they heard a crash. They switched on the lights. On the floorof the lounge there were two small oil paintings, lying face downward. Glass wasshattered, and a print in a frame—the wedding photograph of Jean and JoePritchard had been slashed from end to end, as if with a sharp knife. Thepoltergeist had apparently overheard Mr. O’Donald.When Phillip and Mrs. Scholes returned to the house the next afternoon, all wasquiet. It was still quiet when Joe and Jean Pritchard returned on Saturdayafternoon. Between them, Phillip and Mrs. Scholes related the events of two daysbefore, and Joe Pritchard listened with astonishment, and clearly suspected thatthey were exaggerating. “What kind of knocks?” And as if in reply, there camethree loud, distinct bangs, followed by a rattling of the window frames as acold wind blew through the house. Then there was silence again, and thetemperature returned to normal. The poltergeist had said goodbye for the timebeing.Two years passed. Phillip left school and went to work in his father’s pet shopin the town. Diane had turned into a pretty teenager with blond hair and a goodcomplexion. Mrs. Scholes, now seventy-two, spent most weekends with thePritchards. Perhaps the approach of the August Bank Holiday reminded her of theevents of two years ago; at all events, she began to talk again about the“haunting.” Joe Pritchard found the subject tiresome, and was discouraging.Jean Pritchard had decided to redecorate Diane’s bedroom. One afternoon, shebroke off to go and make tea. She and her mother drank it in the kitchen. Mrs.Scholes reverted to the topic that was obviously troubling her. “I keep hearingnoises.” Jean Pritchard said: “Well I haven’t, and I’m in the house practicallyall the time.”“Didn’t you hear something then?”“No,” said Jean Pritchard, and went out into the hall. She stopped and stared.At the foot of the stairs, there was the counterpane from her bed. It had notbeen there ten minutes earlier, when she came down to make tea. And no one hadbeen out into the hall. She took it back upstairs and put it on her bed. Thenshe went back to her decorating. A few moments later, there was a loud crash.When she looked down the stairs, she saw that another counterpane was lying inthe hall, this time the one from Phillip’s bed. And the crash had been made bythe fall of a number of plant pots, which were upended on the carpet. There wassoil everywhere. In the kitchen, Mrs. Scholes was in tears. She said: “I toldyou. It’s starting again.”When Joe Pritchard came hack, his mother-in-law had gone home. In bed, later,Jean Pritchard was unable to sleep. Even with both windows open, the room wastoo warm. She slipped out of bed and went on to the landing. She had moved thepainting materials out from Diane’s bedroom. Everything was silent. She felt inthe atmosphere the typical chill that she would later come to know so well. Inthe half-light that came from the street lamp outside, she could see somethingmoving in the corner of the landing, something that swayed and rustled. Sheswitched on the landing light. As she did so, something flew past her face,missing it by a fraction of an inch; she identified it later as a paint brush.It was followed by the paste bucket which hit the opposite wall of the landingand scattered paste on the carpet. In the dim light, she could now see what wasmoving. It was a long strip of wallpaper, which had been lying in a roll againstthe wall. Now it was standing on end, and swaying like a cobra. Because therewas obviously no one holding it, she took courage and made a grab for it. Thepaper fluttered gently to the floor. At the same moment, the carpet sweeper flewup into the air, and began to swing around as if being used as a club by aninvisible giant. Too breathless to scream, Jean Pritchard fell on all fours, andscrambled back into her own bedroom. A roll of wallpaper followed her, and hitthe door. At last, she managed to scream. Joe sat up in bed shouting, “What’shappening?” Phillip and Diane appeared from their bedrooms in theirnightclothes. As they stood there, paint brushes and other materials began tofly around. One of them missed Diane’s head by a fraction of an inch. Anotherstruck her on the shoulder. Her father shouted, “Don’t stand there!” And Dianesaid with astonishment: “It didn’t hurt.” Her surprise was understandable; thebrush looked as if it had been moving fast enough to knock her over; yet it hadmerely given her a tap.Then they realized the invisible intruder had moved into Diane’s bedroom.Phillip, staring in astonishment through the doorway, watched the wooden pelmetabove the bedroom window be torn out of the wall—although it was held in bytwo-inch screws—and fly out of the window. They heard it hit the path below.With a burst of anger Joe Pritchard slammed Diane’s bedroom door. From insidethe bedroom, they could hear bangs and thumps. As Diane reached out to touch thedoor handle, Joe Pritchard shouted: “Don’t touch it.” Diane withdrew her handand, as if in response, there was a loud thump on the other side of the door.Diane spent the night in her parent’s room. They locked their doors. It was apointless measure, but it gave them some feeling of security.The poltergeist is basically a mad practical joker; the mentality seems to bethat of an idiot child. What they seem to want is attention; but it is difficultto see why. In a few cases they have communicated—either by raps or directvoice—but as often as not their statements lack coherence.Yet even an absurd practical joke conveys something of the essence of thepersonality of its perpetrator—something as indefinable yet as definite as atone of voice. And the Pritchards soon began to develop this sense of theirunseen lodger as a definite individual. No doubt this also explains why,throughout nine months of chaos, they stuck grimly to their home, and declinedall suggestions that they ought to think about moving. Their sense ofterritoriality was outraged by this intruder, and they had no intention ofleaving him in possession of the field.So in spite of the nerve-wracking nature of the disturbances, life with theghost—“Mr. Nobody,” they called him (Jean Pritchard later christened him“Fred”)—settled into a kind of routine. He seldom paid a visit during theday—possibly because Diane was at school. The racket would usually start uparound bedtime—a series of loud bangs, not unlike a child beating on a big drum.Ornaments would levitate and fly across the room. The lights would go out, andwhen they looked in the cupboard under the stairs the main switch would beturned off. On one occasion, Mrs. Pritchard carefully taped it in the “on”position with insulating tape; half an hour later, the lights were off again,and the tape had simply vanished.At a fairly early stage in the proceedings, Phillip made the suggestion that thespirit might be exorcised. That struck them all as an inspired idea, and VicKelly contacted a local vicar, the Reverend Davy. Mr. Davy explained thatexorcism was not something that could be done at a moment’s notice. He wouldneed permission from the bishop. And since there had been a number of cases inwhich exorcists had been strongly criticized for making things worse, the bishopmight well refuse. At all events, he agreed to call around on the followingThursday evening at seven o’clock. The family felt relieved; it was a comfort tothink that they would be receiving professional advice, so to speak.Jean Pritchard had prepared sandwiches and tea, and Marie and Vic Kelly had beeninvited over. They sat talking, describing what had been happening, and Mr. Davytold them something about the service of exorcism. Neither he nor they wereaware that poltergeists cannot be exorcised—one of Allan Kardec’s ghostlyinformants told him they treated exorcism with contempt. But at least thevicar’s presence seemed to restrain Mr. Nobody. After an hour and a half, therehad been no kind of disturbance, not even a rap. For the first time, JeanPritchard began to wish the poltergeist would oblige with one of his jokes. Mr.Davy finally looked at his watch and said he ought to be getting home. JeanPritchard said: “I’m sorry we’ve dragged you all this way for nothing.”And as she spoke, the house resounded to loud thumps that came from overhead.And a small brass candlestick jumped off the mantelpiece on to the floor.“There,” said Jean Pritchard.Mr. Davy looked thoughtfully at the candlestick. “I think I know what yourproblem is. Subsidence.”“But subsidence,” said Marie, “can only make things fall. And—”The other candlestick rose up from the shelf, floated across in front of thevicar’s nose, then dropped to the floor.“Do you think that’s subsidence?”There was a tremendous crash from the next room, one of those spectacular soundslike a piece of heavy furniture falling through the ceiling. They all rushedinto the lounge.Scattered all over the carpet was every cup, saucer and plate from the chinacupboard. Yet not a single one was broken, or even cracked.Mr. Davy was convinced. He gave it as his opinion that there was “somethingevil” in the house, and advised them to move. Jean Pritchard said she wouldn’tdream of moving—why should she be driven out of her home by a ghost? The vicarwarned her that it might cause real damage—not just to property, but to people.His comment revealed an ignorance of the habits of the poltergeist: in no caseon record have they been known to cause grievous bodily harm, although theirbites, slaps and blows have occasionally driven their victims to despair—as inthe case of John Bell.Mr. Davy left, and the poltergeist proceeded to demonstrate that it had nointention of doing serious harm. Diane was on her way up to bed when the lightswent out. She stood there in the hall, which was dimly lit by the street lamp,which shone through the frosted glass on the front door. Mr. Pritchard waslooking for the torch to look in the main cupboard. As Diane stood there, a hugeshadow appeared on the wall, and the atmosphere became icy. The hall stand—aheavy piece of furniture made of oak—floated up into the air and moved towardher. She tripped and went backwards on the stairs, and the stand pressed down onher. So did an electric sewing machine that had been on it. She tried to push itaway, but it was unbudgeable; it might have weighed a ton. Yet it was notpressing down on her with all its weight—merely holding her pinned to thestairs. She was too breathless to scream.The lights came on, and Diane found her voice and yelled. The family rushed outinto the hall, and her mother tried to drag the stand off her. It wasimpossible; it was simply being held in position by a force that was strongerthan she was. Phillip and Jean Pritchard began to heave on it, but it made nodifference. Diane was whimpering. Mrs. Pritchard advised her to lie still andtry to relax—at least it was now clear she was not being crushed to death. Andas soon as she relaxed, Diane felt a change in the force holding her down. Shesaid: “Now try,” and as they pulled, the stand came off her. So did the electricsewing machine. Yet, oddly enough, neither had bruised her.Mrs. Pritchard helped Diane up to bed. She was shaken, but not frightened—sheseemed to sense that the thing meant her no real harm. But it had not yetfinished with her. As soon as her bedroom light was out, the bedclothes werepulled off the bed, and landed in the corner of the room. The room itself hadbecome icy cold. She had a strong sense there was someone else there with her,although the light from the landing revealed no one. Then her mattress shot intothe air like a magic carpet in the Arabian Nights and she found herself on thefloor, with the mattress on top of her. It all happened in about a second.That night it happened four more times. Each time she found herself on the floorwith the mattress on top of her, yet was still unhurt.The Pontefract poltergeist seemed to be a creature of moods. It could beinventive, as when it filled the lounge with falling chalk dust. It could bedestructive, as when it caused the grandmother clock to hurtle down the stairs,and shatter like a bomb in the hall. And it could be oddly seductive, as when itsignaled its presence with a most delightful scent—a perfume like some heavilyscented flower. But mostly it made a racket, like the phantom drummer ofTedworth. It could be heard several streets away. The Pritchards made a taperecording of it, and it sounds like someone frantically knocking for admittance;you expect to hear a voice yell, “Let me in.”In September 1968, two young reporters came to call; they represented two localpapers. I have the two press cuttings in front of me as I write. “PontefractPoltergeist is Back” announces the Yorkshire Evening Post and the story begins:“Mr. Nobody” has turned up at the home of forty-two-year-old Mrs. JeanPritchard, of East Drive, Pontefract, for the first time in three years (infact, it was two). The Pontefract and Castleford Express announces: “Invisiblehands ‘Rock’ family.” And it goes on to describe the destruction of thegrandmother clock, and how Diane was repeatedly thrown out of bed. It alsomentions that when Phillip tried to record the noises, the plug was pulled outof his tape recorder. “Meanwhile,” the story ends, “the Pritchards’ home hasbecome quite an attraction for amateur ghost hunters. Several people haveknocked on the door and asked if they can stay the night to listen to theghost.”The Pritchards’ home had become known as “the haunted house.” A neighbor heard abus driver announcing to his passengers: “That’s the haunted house,” as theystopped outside. A group of students from Leeds asked permission to camp in thefront garden, but Mrs. Pritchard refused. But in the warm weather, people slepton the huge, round grass verge in front of the Pritchards’ home, and “Mr.Nobody” usually obliged them with his assortment of bangs and crashes. Miners ontheir way to work in the early hours of the morning used to stand by the fenceand listen to the phantom drummer.Not long after the disturbances began, Jean Pritchard bumped into anacquaintance named Rene Holden (Vic Kelly’s sister) in the High Street.Remembering she had a reputation for being a “bit psychic,” she told her whathad been happening. When Mrs. Holden said she was not afraid of ghosts, Jeaninvited her along to see for herself.The next day, she paid her first visit to the house. Jean Pritchard took herupstairs and showed her the chaos that “Fred” could create in a matter ofminutes. The three bedrooms looked as if burglars had been through them.Bedclothes lay in heaps, drawers were pulled open and their contents lyingaround the rooms, and chairs were upside down. Jean explained that she’d tidiedup all three rooms only half an hour before.Jean Pritchard was glad to have somebody to talk to. The two of them took to oneanother immediately, and Mrs. Holden was to witness most of the events that tookplace over the next nine months. On that first evening, the poltergeist was onits best behavior. Jean Pritchard invited Rene to return on the followingSaturday to have something to eat.Mrs. Scholes was staying at East Drive that weekend, but she was feeling ill,and spent most of the time in her room. Joe Pritchard had gone out to the localpub with some friends. When Rene Holden arrived, Jean was making chickensandwiches, with a bird that was still warm from the oven. Rene helped her tomake the sandwiches.As they stood there in the kitchen, the lights suddenly went out. Jean said:“It’s starting.” “I know,” said Rene, “I can feel it.” A moment later, thelights went on again. “That’s odd,” said Jean, “it usually makes us put themon.”The sandwiches and the teapot were placed on a tray and carried through into thelounge. Phillip and Diane were already sitting there, watching television.Before they could start eating, the lights went out again, there was a rushingnoise like a blast of wind, and objects began to fly around in the darkness. Theroom had suddenly gone very cold. They all noticed a pattering noise on thewindow, like someone gently tapping.When they got the lights on again, the room was chaotic, with ornaments andcushions all over the floor. The sandwich plate was still on the table, but itwas empty. And, at first sight the sandwiches seemed to have vanishedcompletely. Then Jean Pritchard noticed a few of them lying behind thetelevision. She picked one of them up. “What is it?” said Mrs. Holden, observingJean’s odd expression. “Look,” said Jean, holding out the sandwich, “something’seaten it!” A huge bite had been taken out of the sandwich and there were teethmarks visible on the bread. Whoever had bitten it had enormous teeth.Mrs. Holden asked if she could keep the sandwich as a memento. In fact, shewanted it as evidence to show anybody who thought her story sounded mad. Shewrapped up the sandwich and put it in her handbag. But a few days later it haddisintegrated into crumbs.Mrs. Holden described another visit to the Pritchards’ home the followingweekend. The Pritchards had invited her to a local Working Mens’ Club for aLadies Night, and Mrs. Holden had had her hair set.Afterwards, she went back to East Drive with the Pritchards for a coffee. As shesat there, the lights all went out. Things started flying around the room, andthe racket was suddenly deafening. At the same time, Rene Holden felt as if herhair was swarming with tiny small creatures—perhaps ants. A cushion hit her inthe face. When Joe Pritchard turned on the main switch a few moments later,everything in the room was upside down. Ornaments lay on the floor, chairs hadbeen overturned, even the pictures had come off the walls.Mrs. Holden made some interesting and relevant suggestions about thepoltergeist. The children were both suffering from some stomach ailment, and itbecame worse whenever the poltergeist appeared. Diane described it as “feelingtwisted up inside.” Mrs. Holden was convinced that the poltergeist was drawingenergy from the solar plexus of the children. She also made the interestingsuggestion that it might be able to draw energy from the underground stream thatflowed beneath the house.It was Mrs. Holden who made the sensible suggestion that they should try andcommunicate with Mr. Nobody. Many poltergeists seem to have a definite desire toexplain themselves. The Pritchards’ visitant proved to be an exception. ThePritchards stood out in the hall, with their hands joined together, and triedconcentrating to see if they could persuade the poltergeist to manifest itself.It did precisely that. There was a sound like a loud wind rushing down thestairs and then over the top of the banisters came a shower of objects: bedding,boxes, ornaments, mattresses, apparently every movable object in the upper partof the house.One snowy evening, Joe Pritchard’s sister Maude Peerce arrived at the house. Shehad decided that it was time to come and investigate the poltergeist in person.And it was clear that her attitude toward the “haunting” was skeptical. She feltthere was something undignified about all the publicity. “There’s got to be alogical explanation for everything—you’ve just got to look for it.” Her idea ofa logical explanation was that Phillip and Diane were having a joke ateverybody’s expense. Joe Pritchard became mildly annoyed and told her she didn’tknow what she was talking about. Phillip and Diane were indignant, but toopolite to be rude.As they sat there, the room suddenly became cold, and Jean Pritchard had thefamiliar sensation that the poltergeist was around. Then the lights went out.Aunt Maude was sitting in the chair by the kitchen fire, and its red glow gaveenough light to see what was happening. First of all, the refrigerator doorswung open. A jug of milk floated out, sailed across the kitchen until it waspoised above Aunt Maude’s head, then tilted and slowly deluged her in milk. Shejumped to her feet, spluttering. Jean found her way to the cupboard under thestairs, and the lights came on again. Aunt Maude pointed. “It was those kids!”“No it wasn’t,” said Jean Pritchard, “they stood by me all the time.” She beganto mop up the milk from the floor and the chair. Aunt Maude refused to beconvinced. Why had the lights gone out before it happened? Clearly becausesomebody had no wish to be seen playing tricks.Aunt Maude was very angry. Jean could understand her anger—she was soaked inmilk. “Look, why don’t you stay the night and see or yourself?”“All right, I will,” said Aunt Maude. She removed her hat and coat, then lookedaround for her gloves. She could only find one. “Don’t worry,” said JeanPritchard, “it will turn up. Things always do.”They moved into the lounge. The lights went out again, and there was a violentbanging sound. Aunt Maude yelled indignantly. Then the lights were turned onagain, the chairs had been turned upside down and the electric fire pulled outof the fireplace. The contents of the refrigerator were strewn around the room,including a string of sausages. The children burst into shrieks of laughter, andAunt Maude became more irritable than ever. “What keeps happening to thelights?”“Something turns them off.”“You mean someone turns them off. Why don’t you lock the cupboard door?”“We do, but it doesn’t make any difference.”But after this incident, the poltergeist decided to allow them to spend a quietevening. They all retired to bed early. It was necessary to rearrange thebeds—Jean, Diane and Aunt Maude moved into Phillip’s bedroom, Phillip moved intoDiane’s, and Joe Pritchard occupied his own bed.Jean Pritchard had only just climbed into bed when the disturbances began. Thereading lamp rose into the air, sailed slowly across the room, and out throughthe door.Then they saw something moving around the door—a closer look showed that it wasthe four small bulbs that produced the glow effect on the electric firedownstairs. Two of them were now dancing around the top of the door, and theother two near the bottom.Then they saw the hands. For a moment, they were petrified. One enormous handappeared over the top of the door, while the other was near the bottom of thedoor, about six inches from the floor. A closer look showed that they were AuntMaude’s fur gloves. Whatever—or whoever—was wearing them must have had enormousarms, since there was a stretch of well over six feet between the top glove andthe lower one.Aunt Maude, who was of an evangelical disposition—in fact, a member of theSalvation Army—pointed accusingly at the gloves and said sternly: “Get away.You’re evil!” She picked up one of her boots and flung it at the door. Thegloves vanished. Jean Pritchard, in spite of her nervousness, could not resistsaying: “Do you still think it’s the kids doing it?” Then the glovesreappeared—floating into the bedroom. One of them seemed to be beckoning tothem, as if trying to persuade them to follow it. “None of us moved,” said JeanPritchard later, “we were too scared.” Then the glove clenched into a fist, andshook threateningly in Aunt Maude’s direction. Aunt Maude responded by burstinginto “Onward Christian Soldiers.” At this, the gloves began to conduct hersinging, beating in time. Jean Pritchard admits that she had to smile. Then thegloves vanished again. And Aunt Maude said decisively: “You’ve got the devil inthis house.”None of them had much sleep that night. When Aunt Maude left the nextmorning—saying that she wouldn’t stay there again for £20,000—her gloves werenowhere to be seen. Jean Pritchard later found them in the bottom of thecupboard. She returned them to Aunt Maude, but Aunt Maude refused to touch them.She carried them into the garden with coal tongs, and burned them with paraffinon the rubbish heap.Soon after this, the poltergeist displayed a new and interesting ability whichis found only in a rare minority of cases—“interpenetration of matter.” Oneevening, as the Pritchards were sitting in the lounge, an egg floated in throughthe door, poised itself very carefully in the air, then fell on the floor. As itexploded, the room filled with a delicious scent that Mrs. Pritchard compared toa garden full of flowers. (Only Phillip found it heavy and cloying.) Whenanother egg floated into the room, Jean Pritchard rushed to the refrigerator,took out all the eggs, and put them into a wooden box. She then sat defiantly onthe lid, convinced that, on this occasion at least, she’d got the better of thepoltergeist. When another egg materialized in mid-air, and exploded like a scentbomb, she jumped up and looked into the box. One egg was missing. She sat downon it again; a moment later another egg exploded. It went on until all the eggslay broken in the middle of the room, and the wooden box was empty. Yet Mrs.Pritchard had sat firmly on its lid throughout. Mr. Nobody could dematerializesolid objects—or perhaps move them into another dimension and then back into ourown.There seems to be no doubt that “Fred” possessed his own juvenile and ratherdestructive sense of humor. Perhaps because Mrs. Pritchard is so obviously atidy person, the ghost seemed to take an unending delight in making messes. WhenJean went to the larder one day, she found that the tea and sugar packets hadbeen emptied, and their contents carefully mixed up together. At four o’clockone morning, after they had been kept awake for hours by the thunderous banging,she went out of the bedroom to discover that the door handles had been smearedwith jam and festooned with lavatory paper. All the way down the stairs, therewas a mixture of marmalade and mustard. Joe Pritchard advised her to come backto bed and deal with it in the morning. But Jean Pritchard is a typicalYorkshire housewife; she filled a bucket with hot water, and tidied up the messbefore she went back to bed. It is an interesting thought that if Jean Pritchardhad been an indifferent housewife who could ignore untidiness, “Fred” might havegiven up a great deal sooner.Vic Kelly, who was a Catholic, continued to feel that exorcism might be theanswer. So after the Pritchards had spent a particularly restless night, hedecided to approach his own priest, Father Hudson. The priest seemed to beslightly better informed about mischievous sprites than his Church of Englandcolleagues, and pointed out that exorcism was no infallible cure forpoltergeists—it might even make them worse. Besides, Father Hudson would alsohave to approach his bishop for permission. He had, nevertheless, an alternativesuggestion. There was nothing to prevent Vic Kelly from sprinkling the housewith holy water and saying a few prayers as he did so. If the thing could beexorcised, a layman could probably do the job as well as a priest.Armed with a bottle of holy water, Vic hurried to the Pritchards’ house. JeanPritchard’s feelings were ambivalent; she knew the poltergeist was likely toresent an attempt to evict it. But when Vic had gone to the trouble of gettingthe holy water, it seemed unfair not to let him try.Vic scattered a few drops of water in each room, starting with the kitchen, andleaving the lounge—Mr. Nobody’s favorite haunt—until last. When he camedownstairs, he went into the lounge, performed his rite of exorcism, andre-capped the bottle, which was now almost empty. Jean Pritchard asked: “DidFather Hudson say how long it would be before we’d know it worked?” As shespoke, an enormous crash sounded from above their heads. Jean said: “Never mind.It didn’t.” Then she noticed the water. It was trickling down the walls inlittle streams, from the level of the ceiling. It was apparently the ghost’s wayof indicating that he was indifferent to holy water.That night, nobody got much sleep. The drumming went on until five in themorning. Furniture overturned, the bedclothes were snatched off repeatedly, andDiane was thrown out of bed several times. The next day they were all dizzy fromlack of sleep, and Diane stayed home from school. In the early afternoon, shemanaged to snatch a few hours sleep on the settee.Having allowed her to recuperate, the poltergeist proceeded to indicate that hehad still not forgiven the attempt to make him feel unwelcome. As Diane stood bythe kitchen fireplace, combing her hair in front of the mirror, Jean Pritchardnoticed that the table drawer was gently sliding out. Then it shot across theroom, and hit Diane in the small of the back, making her gasp. At the same time,she experienced the familiar sensation in her solar plexus—the “sinking feeling”that seemed to indicate that something was about to happen.In the center of the mantelpiece there was a brass crucifix with an image of thecrucified Christ. As Diane stood in the middle of the room, this suddenly leaptfrom the shelf, and stuck against her back. It behaved as if it were made ofiron and Diane was a magnet. Diane looked in the kitchen mirror to see what hadstruck her, and tried to pull it off. It was impossible. She began to feelpanic-stricken. “Get it off me!”Mrs. Pritchard tugged at it, but it might have been glued on. Diane rushed intothe hallway, feeling as she was wrestling with some impalpable force thatsurrounded her. Something fell on to the floor—not the crucifix, but the imageof Jesus. At the other end of the hall, the cross also fell off against thewall. Suddenly, Diane was free. When Jean Pritchard raised the back of herblouse, they found a cross-shaped red mark between her shoulder blades; itstayed there for days before it faded.The attempt at exorcism seems to have inspired “Fred” with a distinctlyanti-Christian bias. On Easter Sunday, Jean Pritchard came downstairs and smeltthe flower-like perfume that indicated that the ghost was around. On all thedoors, someone had painted inverted crosses in gold. In the lounge, there werethree more on the wall. It had been done with considerable precision, as if astencil had been used, and the lack of brush marks suggested a can of spraypaint. She remembered a can of gold spray paint in the outhouse, and eventuallylocated it—Phillip had been intending to use it on his bicycle. She triedspraying it on the door, and discovered that it was impossible to reproduce thecrosses; the glossy surface of the door made the paint run into globules. “Fred”had apparently encountered no such difficulty—another evidence of his peculiarpower over matter.Alarmed by this apparent evidence of a demonic intelligence, Jean Pritchardconsulted the local vicar. He came—accompanied by another clergyman—and lookedat the crosses, then advised her to leave them there over Easter. They promisedto give further consideration to the matter and said they would be back afterthe holiday; in fact, neither returned.“Fred” seemed to take delight in displaying unusual abilities, There was, forexample, the curious episode of Mrs. Holden’s coat. It was made of white mohair,and one day it disappeared—she had to borrow another coat to go home in. Weekslater, they found it in the coal shed, sticking out from underneath the coal.Yet when it was pulled out, it was found to be completely clean.A friend named Alan Williams called one night, and left his car parked outside.When he went back to the car, he was surprised to find that the windscreenwipers were working. This should have been an impossibility, since the car waslocked and the ignition turned off. Suspecting that there might be somethingwrong with the car’s electrical system, Alan Williams had it checked by a garagethe next day. They could find nothing wrong.Alan Williams made another interesting observation that night. When he lookedback at the Pritchards’ house, he says it was surrounded by a dim glow of light.This is confirmed by a neighbor who lived opposite; she looked out of herbedroom window late at night, and observed the same phenomenon; she told Jeanabout it the next day. It is tempting to speculate that the effect was eitherelectrical, or was connected in some way with earth magnetism. Poltergeists—aswe have seen—appear to be able to control certain electrical forces. One of theodder features of this case is that during the period from August 1968 until May1969, when it vanished, the Pritchards quarterly electricity bills were onlyhalf their usual size—about £10 instead of the usual £20. Jean Pritchard washonest enough to point this out to the electricity board; they said that thiswas the reading on the meter, and this would therefore be all she would have topay. It is possible, of course, that “Fred” simply turned back the electricmeter to register less.Then there was the curious mystery of the keys. One morning, as Jean Pritchardwas kneeling in front of the kitchen fireplace, preparing to clean out the flue,a shower of keys descended down the chimney, some of them hitting her on thehead. She counted them and found there were nineteen in all. “Fred” hadcollected every key in the house. But when they had been sorted out, there wasstill one rather old-looking key left. They never identified it, and she stillhas it.And now, at this fairly late stage in the manifestations, the poltergeist beganto show itself. Its first appearance seems to have been to Jean and JoePritchard. They were in bed one night when the door opened. Both looked acrossthe room, and saw a dim figure in the doorway. Jean Pritchard says that itseemed to be very tall, and had a hood over its head. When they switched on thebedside light, it vanished.The next person to see “Fred” was their next-door neighbor, Mrs. May Mountain,who occupies the other half of their semi-detached house. The ghost seems tohave regarded the whole house as his domain, and made drumming noises in Mrs.Mountain’s rooms. It was, admittedly, often difficult to pinpoint where thenoises were coming from—one of the characteristics of poltergeist rappings—butthe cracks in Mrs. Mountain’s ceiling (which are still there) indicate that Fredwas indifferent to the partition wall between the houses. (Cracks also appearedin the Pritchards’ ceilings, but these were repaired a long time ago.)One morning, Mrs. Mountain was at her kitchen sink when she felt someonestanding behind her. She had heard no one come in, and assumed that it was hernephew, who had sneaked in to make her jump. She said something like “Oh, giveover,” and looked around. She found herself looking at a tall figure dressed ina black monk’s habit, with a cowl over the head. Its position prevented her fromseeing the face. She told me that it looked quite solid, and that—oddlyenough—she felt no fear, only curiosity. Then it vanished.During this period, it was clear that the poltergeist was becoming morepowerful. Its drumming noises were now deafening. And it had added a number ofother sounds to its repertoire. There were farmyard noises—the first time theyheard them, the Pritchards thought a cow and some chickens had got into theirbedroom; naturally, the room was empty. “Fred” also made stertorous breathingnoises outside the bedroom door at night. I asked Mrs. Pritchard if she everwent out to investigate. She said: “No, we were too scared. Besides, he’dusually switched off all the lights.” To counter this, she kept a large torch byher side in the evenings, but as often as not, this proved to be minus a batteryor bulb when she wanted to switch it on.Rene Holden was to see the “Monk”—or at least his lower half—at very closequarters. A local spiritualist church had invited Jean Pritchard and Rene alongto talk about their experiences. They sent a car for them. Jean played them thetape, described the events that had taken place, and then answered questions.Later, the same car drove them back home. Jean Pritchard invited the driver infor a cup of tea, and to see for himself the scene of the events she had beendescribing. He was obviously a little nervous, but unwilling to show it openly.As Rene Holden was crossing the lounge, on her way to sit down, the lightssuddenly went out. To reassure the man—who was obviously terrified—Rene reachedout and put her hand on his shoulder as he sat in the armchair. As she did so,she felt a hand on the back of her head. She glanced underneath her outstretchedarm and saw in the light that still came through the curtains, a long blackgarment, like a dressing gown, descending to within an inch or two of the floor.Then the lights came on again, and the man in the black robe was no longerthere.The phenomena reached a kind of climax one evening when Diane had gone to thekitchen to make coffee. The lights went out, and while Jean Pritchard wasgroping for the torch, she heard Diane scream. It was dusk, and there was, infact, enough light to be able to see their way around the house. They found thatDiane was being dragged up the stairs, and it was light enough to see that hercardigan was stretched out in front of her, as if “Fred” was tugging at it; hisother hand was apparently on her throat. Phillip and Jean Pritchard rushed upthe stairs and began trying to pull Diane down again; she was yelling withterror—this was the first time it had “laid hands on her,” so to speak. Phillipand Jean Pritchard went tumbling backwards down the stairs with Diane. Philiphas the impression that it was his thought of trying to touch the presence thatcaused it to let go. He made the interesting comment: “It always seemed to beahead of you.” Diane had to be given a large brandy. In the light, they saw thather throat was covered with red finger marks.It was at about this time that Jean Pritchard came downstairs one morning, andrealized that the hall carpet was soaked with water. Then, as she looked, shesaw footprints on the wet surface—huge footprints . . .Yet “Fred’s” activities were almost at an end. One day, Phillip and Diane werein the lounge, watching television when Phillip looked around, and saw the shapeon the other side of the frosted glass door that led to the dining room andkitchen. Diane followed his gaze, and also saw the figure. It might, of course,have been someone who had walked in. Phillip opened the door, and saw the tall,black shape of the “Monk” vanishing. He says that it seemed to disappear intothe kitchen floor.A friend of Joe Pritchard’s who had just returned from Scotland told him thatthe crofters there hung cloves of garlic over doors and windows to keep out“spirits.” The Pritchards had heard of garlic being used to repel vampires—as inthe various Dracula films—but had no idea that it had a wider application.Phillip volunteered to go and buy dried garlic at the local supermarket. Andthis, it seems, did the trick. The house smelt strongly of garlic—fortunately,none of them minded the smell—but “Fred” disappeared. It may be that thehaunting had reached its natural conclusion anyway. Or that Fred’s feelings werefinally hurt by this evidence of their desire to get rid of himSo the manifestations ended as abruptly as they had begun. And Jean Pritchardwas at last able to settle down to redecorating her house, and assessing thedamage. Fred had damaged walls and cracked ceilings, as well as smashing enoughcrockery to fill a tea chest. It had also destroyed the grandmother clock. Yetapart from this, it had done no real damage. Diane seemed to be the specialobject of its good-natured malice, yet she told me that she felt it never meantto harm her. It could certainly have done far more dangerous things than itactually did. On one occasion when Mrs. Scholes was in the kitchen, a largepotato shot out of a box, flew across the room, and shattered against the wall,missing her head by a fraction of an inch. The force required to shatter a solidpotato is considerable; if it had hit her it would have been like a blow from aclub. Yet there seems to be some kind of law that poltergeists avoid doingsevere physical damage to persons. Like the school bully, they seem to enjoycausing alarm and dismay; they would be capable of swinging a cricket bat withinan inch of someone’s nose after waving it threateningly. Those who can befrightened seem to be more vulnerable than those who get angry. Yet, like theschool bully, the poltergeist seems to bear in mind that if he goes too far, itmight come to the attention of the headmaster. There may be other explanations,but this one seems to fit.It was about ten years after “Fred” had departed that Tom Cunniff, a young manwith an interest in local history, heard of the Pontefract poltergeist, andfound himself wondering whether it had any connection with the local priory,which had existed from 1090 until 1539. He went along to see the Pritchards, andwrote down their story. He was particularly excited by one piece of information.Jean Pritchard mentioned that a neighbor had found a book in the Pontefractpublic library which mentioned that a Cluniac monk had been hanged for the rapeof a young girl in the time of Henry the Eighth (that is, not long before thedestruction of the priory). A little more research showed him that the gallowshad been on the top of the hill where the Pritchards’ house now stood, and thattheir house stood on the site of an old bridge called “Priest’s Bridge.”Tom’s theory, which he incorporated into a typescript called Mea Culpa, was thatthe monk had committed a rape followed by murder (Mrs. Pritchard also seemed toremember that the girl had been strangled), had been executed for his crime, andnow haunted the spot where he was hanged. The attack on Diane, he thought, wasbasically sexual in nature.Unfortunately for this fascinating theory, there is no evidence whatever that amonk of Pontefract was ever hanged for rape. Pontefract is a small town, andthere are a few local histories. They are to be found in the reference sectionof the library, where I spent a morning in August 1980. My search revealed thatthe local monks were involved in a great deal of litigation and a certain amountof violence—their virtues were war-like rather than contemplative—but there wasundoubtedly no rape and murder. Perhaps the neighbor had read the story of thehanging of a vicar called George Beaumont in the time of the Civil War, when theParliamentarians were besieging the Royalists in Pontefract Castle; he wasaccused of carrying on a correspondence with the Royalists. He, as far as I cansee, is the only priest to have been hanged in the area.But is it necessary to assume that the Pritchards were haunted by a Cluniacmonk? We must bear in mind that the poltergeist seemed prone to take upsuggestions that it heard. On its first visit, it slashed the small picture—butonly after Mr. O’Donald had remarked that poltergeists often destroyphotographs. The grandmother clock was destroyed one evening after a group oflocal councilors had been to the house and listened to the banging sounds. (JoePritchard’s mother was Pontefract’s first Lady Mayor at the time.) Beforeleaving, the Mayor remarked that she was surprised that the grandmother clock onthe landing was still intact; half an hour later, it hurtled downstairs andshattered.Unfortunately, Jean Pritchard kept no diary of the sequence of events. So we donot know whether the “monk’s” first appearance—in their bedroom—was before orafter the neighbor had borrowed the book from the library. My own guess is thatit was after, and that it was inspired by what it had heard. In the same way,the upside-down crosses appeared on the walls and doors after Vic Kelly’sattempt at exorcism. During the course of that evening, someone probably made aremark about evil spirits and their propensity to invert the cross.Why was the Pritchards’ home chosen? I believe that Mrs. Holden came close tothe truth when she suggested that the underground stream may have some thing todo with it. If Lethbridge is correct, then the “field” of running, water—and ofdampness in general—records “psychic impressions.” When “Fred” first made hisappearance in 1966, Phillip had just passed the age of puberty, and wastherefore an ideal “focus.” Poltergeists only seem to manifest in unhappyhouseholds, and in the Pritchards’ home there was a certain amount of tensionbetween Joe Pritchard and his son. Joe Pritchard had been a sporting enthusiast,and he found it incomprehensible that his son should prefer books and music.Presumably it was because of this tension between father and son that Phillipstayed at home when the rest of the family went to Devon. Tom Cunniff’stheory—incorporated into his manuscript—is that “Fred’s” first appearance was anunconscious expression of Phillip’s resentment toward his father; but this is atodds with his view that the “ghost” was a Cluniac monk. It seems to mealtogether more probable that “Fred” was simply an ordinary poltergeist—somekind of “elemental” (we shall look more closely into the meaning of that term inthe next chapter)—who found the kind of energy he needed in the Pritchards home,and proceeded to make use of it. He was certainly one of the most inventivepoltergeists on record; I can find nothing like him in the annals of this typeof haunting. The sounds, the smells, the animal noises, the heavy breathing, thebites on sandwiches, and, finally, the appearances, make him almost unique. Itis a pity that no trained investigator came on the scene while the disturbanceswere at their height. The Doncaster Psychical Research Group (now dissolved)became interested in the case in the spring of 1969, and their own conclusionswere cautiously skeptical—as seems to be the case with such groups the worldover; but most of the phenomena had become infrequent by that time. Aninvestigator who noticed “Fred’s” propensity to imitate phenomena he hearddiscussed might have conducted a fascinating series of experiments, trying tofind out just what Fred was capable of. Would he, for example, have made “humandummies,” like the Phelps poltergeists, if someone had mentioned this within hishearing?I drove up to Pontefract in late August of 1980 to interview as many witnessesas possible. At this time, I was inclined to accept the usual view ofpoltergeists as “RSPK”—recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis. But on the way toYorkshire, I spent the night at a conference in Derbyshire, and had theopportunity to meet Guy Playfair, with whom I had been corresponding for sometime. We discussed the view—expressed in The Flying Cow—that a poltergeist isbasically a mischievous disembodied spirit. I was inclined to be skeptical. Guyexplained his own notion of the nature of the poltergeist: “It’s a kind offootball.” “Football!” “A football of energy. It somehow gets exuded fromdisturbed teenagers at puberty. Along come two or three spirits or elementals,look through this window, and see the football lying around. And they do whatany group of schoolboys would do—they go and kick it around, smashing windowsand generally creating havoc. Then, as often as not, they get tired and leaveit. In fact, the football usually explodes. Oddly enough, it turns into water .. .”The more I thought about this view, the more it struck me as interesting andplausible. There are, in fact, a large number of poltergeist cases in which thephenomena occur just once. In fact, I am relatively certain that one suchoccurred in my own house. It was in 1960, and my family—my father, mother andthirteen-year-old sister—had moved to Cornwall to live with us. One bright,sunny morning, I was awakened by a loud, repeated banging sound. It sounded justlike someone hammering on something made of metal, with slow, steady blows.It so happened that two friends were sleeping up in the attic. My first thoughtwas that one of their beds had collapsed, and someone was hammering at thebed-frame to try and get it apart, in order to reassemble it. I got out of bed,went to the foot of the stairs and called: “What’s going on up there?” All wassilence. I went upstairs, and saw both friends were fast asleep. I peeped intomy sister’s bedroom; she was asleep. But the sounds now seemed to be coming fromoutside the house—perhaps on the roof.I went downstairs and outside. It was a very still, sunny morning—about fivea.m.—and the sounds were undoubtedly coming from our house (which stands alonein the middle of a field), and not from some neighboring house. I walked all theway round the house, but could not locate the noise. It seemed to be coming fromoverhead. The obvious suspicion—that it was something to do with the hot watersystem (which sometimes “knocks” as it heats up)—was dismissed when I saw thatthe sounds were not coming from any of the hot water pipes.During all this time, the sounds went on—loud, clear, metallic bangs, exactlylike someone hammering on an iron bedstead with a hammer. My father was awake bythis time, and we both walked around the house again. Then, as it was impossibleto locate it, we went back to bed. Ten minutes later, the noise stopped. Aboutan hour later, it started up again briefly, for perhaps a dozen bangs. Then itstopped. And we have not heard it since. I assume that the sounds were somehowconnected with my sister, who was not particularly happy at being dragged awayfrom her home town (Leicester) to live in the country.I went to see Tom Cunniff in Pontefract, and he told me about the DoncasterResearch Group. They had, apparently, fixed upon Phillip as the culprit. Theyhad analyzed the tape recording, and decided that it could have been faked. Andthey had searched the house, and found in the attic a circle free of dust,which—they decided—might have been made by a loudspeaker, lying face downwards.This, then, “explained” the banging noises.As soon as I went into the Pritchards’ home, I became convinced that this theorywas absurd. They had brought in a number of neighbors—like Mrs. Mountain—andDiane and Phillip were also present. They played us the tape, and then answeredquestions. What struck me most strongly was the spontaneity of the whole thing.They might contradict one another “No, it wasn’t that day, it was the day whenAlan Williams came because, you remember, he put his hat down on that chair andit disappeared . . .” but they were obviously discussing something they had alllived through. And every one of them remembered some slightly different aspectof what had taken place. No group of conspirators could have made up such astory, and then told it so convincingly. These were simply a crowd of ordinarypeople who had been through a strange experience, and who would never forget it.Diane intrigued me when she told me that she had “seen things” at other times.When she was six years old, she came out of her bedroom one day, and saw an oldlady dressed in grey outside her mother’s bedroom door. Jean Pritchard assumedthat she had been dreaming. Diane also told me how, in her teens, she waswalking past the grounds of a nearby hospital, which was being partly demolishedfor rebuilding, and was surprised to see two women in crinolines walking amongthe trees. She said they seemed to be “floating” over the grass. She stoodwatching them for about a quarter of an hour before they vanished into thetrees.What I find even more interesting is that the whole area is permeated withstories of hauntings. At the present time, there is another house in theChequerfields area where a “ghost” has appeared to a number of tenants. TomCunniff has noted a number of other stories—for example, poltergeist occurrencesat a pub called the Golden Lion, kept at the time by Mrs. Pritchard’ssister-in-law, Christine.When I left the Pritchards’ house that afternoon, I had become a convert to GuyPlayfair’s theory of the poltergeist. The first thing that struck me wasPhillip’s description of the water appearing on the kitchen floor on that Augustday in 1966. That certainly seemed to fit amazingly well with Guy’s statementthat the “electrical energy” used by the poltergeist turns into water.Admittedly, the “spontaneous psychokinesis” view might explain the water equallywell—except that it hardly seems to make sense for the disturbed unconsciousmind of a teenager to create large quantities of water on the kitchen floor.Banging and rapping noises, yes. Objects flying through the air, yes. But whycircular pools of water?But what really changed my mind about the psychokinesis theory was Diane’sdescription of being dragged up the stairs by the entity. Nobody in the house onthat evening had any doubt about her terror and confusion. It is justconceivable that Diane’s unconscious mind might throw her out of bed—by way ofdemanding attention. But by no stretch of the imagination can I imagine itgrabbing her by the throat and dragging her up the stairs.The subsequent research for this book—the study of hundreds of accounts ofpoltergeist hauntings—has only strengthened my view that the RSKP theory leaveshalf the phenomena unexplained.Monasteries and churches are often built on older religious sites, as we havealready noted. The reason seems to be that the ground has some kind of “power,”perhaps a purely magnetic force. My wife, who is an excellent dowser, said thatshe felt almost dizzy when she first tried dowsing on Glastonbury Tor, one ofEngland’s oldest “sacred sites.” And she also obtained a powerful response whendowsing the area of Pontefract’s ruined priory, and of the nearby castle. On thesite of an old chapel in the castle grounds there is a stone sarcophagus thatseems to date to the Roman period. When it was found in the eighteenth century,it contained the bones of a man who had been beheaded—the skull had been placedbetween his legs. It is believed that this is the skeleton of Thomas ofLancaster, the man who headed the opposition against Edward II, a homosexual whopoured favors on his friend Piers Gaveston. In 1312, Gaveston was seized andexecuted in the presence of Thomas of Lancaster. The king had Thomas ambushedand beheaded. As I watched my wife walking around the stone sarcophagus, I sawthe dowsing rod twisting violently in her hands—once at the foot and once at thehead of the coffin. It had been placed where the altar would stand if the chapelstill existed. Why should the sarcophagus be placed precisely upon this spot?Could it be to counteract some unpleasant influence associated with thesarcophagus?I am suggesting, then, that the solution to the mystery of the Black Monk ofPontefract may lie in the ground itself. It is “haunted ground,” land thatretains impressions for a long time. Only a few days before I arrived inPontefract, a nursing sister in the Pontefract Royal Infirmary—where Phillip wasthen working—came into the television room. There were two other members ofstaff there, and she noticed, as she sat down, that there was also a man in adressing gown. Patients were not allowed in that room, and after a moment sheturned her head to look at the man. He was no longer there—yet he could not haveleft the room without walking past her; he had been sitting in the corner.This, then, is my own theory about the Black Monk case. The ground itselfcontains some peculiar force that favors “manifestations.” The early hauntingwas triggered by Phillip and by his psychological tension. The “entity” remainedin the area until Diane—who herself seems to possess undeveloped mediumisticpowers—could provide the energy it needed to manifest itself. When that energyceased to be available, it again became inactive; perhaps waiting for anotherprovider-of-energy to offer it the chance to erupt into the space-and-time worldof humanity . . ."},{"pageContent":"five [../Text/Contents.xhtml#five-anchor]Fairies, Elementals,and Dead MonksSome thirty miles to the northwest of the Pritchards’ home, there is anotherpiece of “haunted ground” known as Fairy Dell. The events that took place therein July 1917 are still the subject of controversy.On a Saturday afternoon in that month, Arthur Wright, an engineer, went into hisdarkroom to develop a photograph taken earlier in the day by hissixteen-year-old daughter Elsie. As the plate began to develop, Wright saw vaguewhite shapes appearing—-he took them for birds. But when the picture becameclear, he was startled to see that they were fairies. The picture showed aserious-faced little girl—Elsie’s cousin Frances Griffiths, aged eleven,standing behind a bush, her chin propped on her hand. And in front of her,dancing on top of the bush, were four neat little female figures with wings anddiaphanous garments, one of them playing a pan-pipe. “What on earth are they?”said Arthur Wright to his daughter, who was standing behind him. “Fairies,” shesaid, matter-of-factly.Now, working-class Yorkshiremen tend to be phlegmatic and down-to-earth. ArthurWright did not press his daughter for explanations; he merely grunted, andawaited further developments. They came a month later, when the girls againborrowed his camera. Elsie and Frances scrambled across the deep stream—or“beck”—that ran at the bottom of the garden, and went to the old oaks in thedell beyond. And when Arthur Wright later developed the plate, it showed Elsiesitting on the grass, holding her hand out to a gnome who was apparently aboutto step up on to her dress.This time, Arthur and his wife Polly looked through the bedroom of the girls,hoping to find cut-out pictures that would explain the photographs. They foundnothing. Arthur Wright became mildly exasperated when both girls insisted therehad been no trickery—that there really were fairies at the bottom of theirgarden. He told Elsie she couldn’t use the camera again until she told him thetruth.In November 1917, Frances wrote a letter to a friend in South Africa enclosingone of the photographs, and remarking casually that it “is me with some fairiesup the beck . . .”These events took place in the village of Cottingley, in Yorkshire, on the roadfrom Bradford to Bingley. It has long since ceased to be a separate village, andhas become a part of the urban sprawl; but the Fairy Dell still exists.In the summer of 1919, Polly Wright, Elsie’s mother, went to a meeting of theTheosophical Society in Bradford. She was interested in “the occult,” having hadexperiences of astral projection and memories of past lives. The lecture thatevening was on fairies—for it is the position of the Theosophical Society thatfairies are simply a type of “elemental spirit”—nature spirits—that can manifestthemselves to people with second sight or “clairvoyance.” Naturally, Mrs. Wrightcould not resist mentioning her daughter’s “fairy photographs” to the personsitting next to her. As a result, Arthur Wright made prints of the twophotographs, and they were passed from hand to hand at the Theosophists’conference at Harrogate a few weeks later, and finally made their way to London,and into the hands of Edward Gardner, who was the president of the London branchof the Theosophical Society. Gardner was familiar with faked photographs ofghosts and spirits, and decided that these looked doubtful. He asked hiscorrespondent if he could let him see the negatives. When these arrived a fewdays later, Gardner was surprised to find no evidence of double exposure orother cheating. He took the negatives to a photography expert named Snelling,who examined them carefully under a powerful lens, and announced that it wasundoubtedly not a double exposure. Nor were the dancing fairies made of paper,or painted on to a sheet of glass. They had moved during the exposure. A weeklater, after enlarging the photographs, Snelling announced that, in his opinion,they were not faked. They were ordinary open-air shots.It so happened that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, hadagreed to write an article on fairies for the Christmas number of the StrandMagazine (in which Holmes first appeared). When he heard about the photographs,he contacted Gardner and asked if he could see them. The two men met, and agreedthat the pictures were too good to be true—the waterfall in the background(which looked like a painted backcloth), the highly appropriate toadstools . . .Gardner agreed to go to Cottingley to see the girls, and to find out whetherthey were hoaxers. Mr. and Mrs. Wright were startled to hear that the expertsthought the photographs genuine. And Gardner was startled when he walked up theglen with Elsie, and saw the scene exactly as she had photographed it, completewith waterfall and toadstools—although without fairies.Gardner decided to test the girls. Two cameras were bought, and the film-plateswere sealed so they could not be tampered with. In due course, the negativeswere returned to Gardner, and the factory that had produced them verified thatthey were still sealed. One showed Frances with a fairy leaping close to herface, another showed a fairy offering a flower to Elsie, while the third showedtwo fairies in the middle of a bush. In the center of the picture there is anobject that looks rather like a bathing costume hung on a line. Elsie apparentlyhad no idea what this was; but Gardner, with his wider knowledge of fairy lore,identified it as a “magnetic bath” which fairies weave in dull weather. (It hadrained continually that August.)Once more, the experts got to work to try to discover if the photographs hadbeen faked; again, they concluded that they were genuine. That Christmas,Doyle’s article on the fairies appeared in the Strand Magazine and caused asensation. Inevitably, the majority of people thought it was a hoax; yet noexpert on photography was able to say anything conclusive about how it mighthave been done. A reporter on the Westminster Gazette learned the trueidentities of the girls (Conan Doyle had used pseudonyms to protect them frompublicity) and went to see them. He concluded that everyone seemed honest andgenuine, and there was no evidence of trickery. Arthur Wright was baffled by itall, and deeply disappointed that Conan Doyle was naive enough to be taken in,“bamboozled by our Elsie, and her at the bottom of her class.” Conan Doyle washimself puzzled and critical; yet he could not discount the possibility thatthese were real fairies, nature spirits of some kind. He contacted a well-knownclairvoyant named Geoffrey Hodson, and Hodson went to Cottingley, talked to thegirls, and went to the dell with them. He also saw fairy forms. (We shall havemore to say about Hodson in a moment.)By the end of 1921, most people had lost interest in the fairies. Conan Doylewas to write a book about the case, called The Coming of the Fairies, which cameout in 1922; but there was no re-investigation.In 1965, a Daily Express reporter named Peter Chambers discovered that Elsie wasstill alive, having spent most of her life in India, and now back in the northof England. He went to see her, and asked her straight out whether the pictureswere faked. Elsie neither denied nor confirmed this; she said she would preferto leave it “open.” She made the curious statement that the fairies were“figments of her imagination.” This certainly sounds like a confession; but ifit is, why did she not say openly that the photographs were faked? Six yearslater, in 1971, the BBC’s Nationwide program discovered that both Elsie andFrances were still alive, and interviewed both. Again, both declined to deny orconfirm the genuineness of the photographs. Elsie says: “I’d rather leave thatopen, if you don’t mind. But my father had nothing to do with it, I promise youthat.” Again, this sounds like a veiled admission of faking; but four yearslater, in 1975, Elsie gave an interview to Walter Clapham, of Woman, in whichshe stated again what both girls had maintained at the time—that they had seenfairies repeatedly in the dell, and had photographed them. Elsie mentioned thatshe was “psychic,” and described a number of occasions on which she had seenghosts. (Gardner had been convinced that both Elsie and Frances were mediums.)As to the fairy photographs, she admitted that they had been intended as a hoax,but not quite of the kind suspected by the non-believers. It seems that on theday they took the first photograph Frances had fallen into the stream, and hadtried to get out of trouble by lying about in it. She had been soundlyadmonished for stretching the truth. Elsie borrowed her father’s camera tocomfort Frances, and when they began to discuss the lying issue, Elsie pointedout that grown-ups lie—for example, about Father Christmas. So they would gettheir revenge in a rather convoluted manner. They would take photographs offairies, and show them to the grown-ups. And if the grown-ups took themseriously, they’d reply: “But you know fairies don’t exist.”Their revenge fell flat, since Elsie’s parents declined to believe in thefairies.In 1976, a Yorkshire folklorist and psychical investigator, Joe Cooper,persuaded Elsie and Frances to appear on a television program. His account ofwhat happened is contained in a book called The Case of the Cottingley Fairies.I met Joe Cooper on my visit to Yorkshire in August 1980, and he told me thenthat his final conclusion was that Elsie and Frances are genuine; they reallydid see fairies. In his book, he records conversations with Elsie in which shemakes statements such as: “Fairies and elves are tremendously interested in thedoings of human beings.” In the dell, she told Cooper: “Round about here thegnomes used to come,” and in reply to his question about what they wore: “Russetcolors—they were a bit shy.” She describes the photographing of the fairiesquite circumstantially, with no attempt to imply that they were pureimagination: “When it [the elf] became clear Frances pressed the trigger on thebox camera.” Asked why she never made a grab for the fairies, she replied: “Youcouldn’t. It’s like grabbing for a ghost or something.” And to the question:“Did you in any way fabricate these photographs?” Frances replied flatly: “Ofcourse not.”The most interesting point established by Joe Cooper is that Elsie isundoubtedly psychic—either that, or a liar. She told him of a lady with a dogwho used to come to her bedside when she was a child of four. Elsie talked toher, but the lady never replied. On one occasion, Elsie claims, the lady broughta fox terrier, which somehow located a penny she had under her pillow, andswallowed it. When Elsie shouted, her mother rushed upstairs. The lady and thedog had vanished, but they never found the penny.Elsie also tells of an occasion when she came downstairs one evening for a drinkof water, and found a strange man in his shirtsleeves in front of the fire,reading a newspaper, and a woman with a white apron came from the kitchen with adish of rice pudding and put it in the oven. When Elsie asked where her parentswere, the man told her they were playing cards at their neighbors, the Moffs.Elsie said she wanted to see them, and the man opened the door for her—the latchwas too high for her to reach. When she knocked on the door of the Moffs, herparents were highly alarmed to hear about the strangers in their house, andrushed back immediately. The house was in darkness. The only sign that anythingstrange had occurred was that the door was still open. And Arthur Wright hadlocked it when they went out.The case of the Cottingley fairies remains unproven. For the skeptics, thestrongest evidence against it is the photographs themselves. The fairies look alittle too conventional. The BBC demonstrated that it is not too difficult tofake fairies; they showed their reporter surrounded by them in the studio; thesefairies were cardboard cut-outs that moved on wire (to make them stand up). Itis therefore entirely conceivable that Elsie and Frances used cutouts supportedby wire. In that case, it would be perfectly understandable that they aredisinclined to confess. All their defenders, from Conan Doyle to De VereStacpoole, would be made to look idiots, and an intriguing mystery would finallybe dismissed and forgotten. Yet there is surely no reason why, in that case,they should continue to insist that they saw fairies frequently as children.Frances told Joe Cooper that she still “almost” sees them, from the corners ofher eyes, but declines to have her attention drawn to them.[1] (Cooper quotesanother man who claims to have seen fairies, but only out of the corner of hiseye.)The view that was held by Gardner, Doyle and Hodson is that what the childrensaw were “elementals.” Elementals are nature spirits, particularly of woods andstreams. There are four basic elementals: gnomes, sylphs, salamanders andnereids, being respectively the spirits of earth, air, fire and water. It wouldbe a fair assumption that in the twentieth century, only members of the lunaticfringe believe in such creatures. This is not so. Writing in his classic workThe Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries, W. Y. Evans-Wentz writes:We seem . . . to have arrived at a point in our long investigations where we canpostulate scientifically . . . the existence of such invisible intelligences asgods, genii, daemons, all kind of true fairies, and disembodied man . . . Thegeneral statement may be made that there are hundreds of carefully proven casesof phenomena or apparitions precisely like many of those which the Celtic peopleattribute to fairies.And by way of example, he goes on to cite poltergeists, which, he points out,sound very much like what have been called demons, fairies and elementals. Hegoes on to quote the famous French investigator (and astronomer) CamilleFlammarion, who points out that the pranks of poltergeists are thoroughlypuerile and resemble the mischief of badly behaved children. Flammarion goes onto make the important statement:These spirits are not necessarily the souls of the dead; for other kinds ofspiritual beings may exist, and space may be full of them without our everknowing anything about it, except under unusual circumstance. Do we not find indifferent ancient literatures demons, angels, gnomes, goblins, sprites,spectres, elementals, etc? Perhaps these legends are not without some foundationin fact.The scientist and psychic investigator Sir William Crookes came to the sameconclusion, summarizing his theory in the words:The actions of a separate order of beings, living on this earth, but invisibleand immaterial to us. Able, however, occasionally to manifest their presence.Known in almost all countries and ages as demons (not necessarily bad), gnomes,fairies, kobolds, elves, goblins, Puck etc.Moreover, as Evans-Wentz remarks, the kind of people who claim to have seenfairies are not usually excitable, hysterical or neurotic; they tend to be veryordinary. Andrew Lang made the same observation about people who have seenghosts—that they are usually “steady, unimaginative, unexcitable people withjust one odd experience.” Joe Cooper’s observations bear this out: for example,a National Serviceman out having a picnic with his girlfriend in Gibraltar whenthe sandwich was snatched from his hand by a little man about eighteen incheshigh, who then ran away. The account is completely matter-of-fact: “his featureswere just human, they weren’t distorted, a big bulbous nose or chin . . . and Inoticed he had a hammer in his hand . . .”When I was lecturing at the Edinburgh Festival in 1978, I was interviewed in thelocal Scottish TV studio by an interviewer named Bobbie (whose second name,regrettably, I failed to note in my journal). He was apparently a well-knowninterviewer on Scottish news programs, and he commuted between the Edinburgh andGlasgow studios. When, afterwards, we sat in the pub next door, he told mecasually that he had seen a gnome and that it had “scared the hell out of him.”He was picking up a friend outside a convent, and had seen the gnome—a very thinman—standing on the pavement outside the gate. Something about the figure hadterrified him and he drove off at top speed. Most stories of “fairy” sightingsare like this, oddly circumstantial and oddly pointless.Marc Alexander tells such a story in his book Enchanted Britain. He has beendiscussing the case of Elsie and Frances, and speculates that these strangebeings are not necessarily of a definite shape and size, that would be seen byanyone who happened to be on the spot. “Mankind down the ages has interpretedvisions according to his experience and metaphysical outlook—the old Christianssaw angels, we see UFOs.” He goes on to tell a story of a friend named PatAndrew, whom he knew in New Zealand, and who claimed to have seen a pixiesitting on a gate when he was six. When a stage hypnotist came to town, MarcAlexander and his friend both began to experiment with hypnosis, and soon becameproficient at it. One day, Marc Alexander tried regressing Pat Andrew to the ageof six, to find out whether the story about the pixie was invention.When he reached this point he exclaimed in a wondering, high-pitched voice:“Look, a pixie.” He then continued, to whatever it was that he was seeing onceagain on the gate, “Hello, little fellow.” There was a pause, while presumablythe pixie returned his greeting, then Pat said: “You’re a pixie, aren’t you?”Again there was a silence from the young man with closed eyes as in his memorythe pixie answered his questions.It was strange to listen to this one-sided conversation, to the questions that achild would ask a pixie such as where did it live, what did it eat, what was itsname, and so on. All I could hear were the words Pat had actually used sixteenyears earlier, but they left me in no doubt that as a child my friend had spokento something sitting on top of a gate which had replied to him as a pixie.What intrigued Marc Alexander was that Andrew’s description of the little manmade it clear that he was a traditionally English pixie with a pointed hat, notthe Maori equivalent of pixies, the turehu—and until the hypnotic experiment hehad been inclined to assume that the pixie had been a figment of his friend’simagination—not a deliberate lie, but a fantasy that had taken on reality for asmall boy.The dowser Tom Lethbridge, whom we have met in chapter 1, was convinced thatthere are various types of “earth field” connected with different elements:water fields (which he called naiad fields), oread fields, associated with openspaces and mountains, and dryad fields, associated with woodland. Each field hasits own kind of entity—or spirit—associated with it. But Lethbridge believesthese are simply a property of the field—recordings—not real spirits. He says:Little people are seen now and then by many races of men. They are seen inAfrica, for instance, where they are just like tiny Africans. I do not for amoment doubt that they are seen, but I do doubt the interpretation placed on theseeing. We can take it as an observed fact that ordinary men and women all overthe world have seen little people; but I do not believe that they really existas such. Throughout this investigation we are assuming that people do not go outof their way to tell lies. When they say that they have seen a little man, theyare not just making up a story based on tradition. They have seen somethingwhich appeared to their mind as a little man.But Lethbridge goes on to tell two stories that contradict this hypothesis.(Lethbridge evolved from book to book, so this often happens.) In July 1922,Lethbridge and a party of friends were visiting the Shiant Islands off thenorthwestern coast of Scotland. One of them climbed a hill, and left hiswaterproof coat and lunch basket there by a marked rock. When he returned, theyhad vanished. Yet the island was deserted (apart from the rest of the party whowere elsewhere); there were only seabirds, who could hardly lift a heavy lunchbasket. He was convinced that they had been stolen by the “Sith”—or fairies—andLethbridge acknowledged later that he felt they were wrong to laugh at thisbelief.Lethbridge himself had a supernatural experience on the island of SkelligMichael. He was with the friend who had lost his lunch. Lethbridge went offalone to examine the site of a Celtic monastery, then looked over the cliff anddecided to climb down and look at the monastery’s rubbish dump. Halfway there,he had an unpleasant sensation—what he would later call a “ghoul”—the feelingthat someone wanted to push him down the cliff. The feeling became so strong ashe went on that he felt giddy. He decided to go back to the cliff top. Back atthe site of the Celtic church, something suddenly flung him flat on his face.There was no wind, no animal, no other person. He later came to accept that whathad flung him down was some form of poltergeist and, in Ghost and Ghoul,speculates that it may have been associated with a shipwreck of the previousyear.But then, Lethbridge also knew that the sites of churches are often chosenbecause of some “earth force,” some innate “holiness” in the ground itself, andeven pointed out that such churches are often named after St. Michael, becausethe saint became the Christian counterpart of the pagan god of light, Lugh (orLucifer). This was the way the early Christians tried to “decontaminate” a placefrom its pagan origins. Unfortunately, he knew nothing about Guy Underwood’sdiscovery of ‘holy lines’ around sites like Stonehenge,[2] and knew nothingabout ley lines, which were only just being rediscovered by John Michell andothers during the last years of Lethbridge’s life; he might otherwise have takenthe step—to which he comes so close in Ghost and Ghoul—of connecting some ofthese mysterious earth forces with the entity that stole his friend’s lunchbasket and knocked him flat on his face on an island named after St. Michael.But Joe Cooper takes this step, in discussing the Cottingley fairies. Hediscusses a book with the off-putting title Secrets of the Gods by E. T.Stringer, and published in 1974. It is subtitled “An Outline of Tellurianism,”and the author—who is a climatologist who teaches at BirminghamUniversity—defines this as a philosophy based on the notion of a Telluric force(earth force, Tellus being the Roman earth goddess). This, he says, is the forcemade use of by dowsers and psychic investigators—that is, Lethbridge’s “fields.” But he adds: “The Telluric force is not aphysical force, as is magnetism or gravity. It cannot be measured by anyscientific instrument . . .”From this point on, Stringer’s theory departs from that of Lethbridge orUnderwood. He believes that the Telluric force holds people together in aparticular place—often country areas—and that people somehow constitute thecells of a larger organism (which he calls the Oikumeos). Stringer’s earth is aliving creature, and human beings live in its bloodstream of Telluric force asthe tiny independent creatures called mitochondria live in our bodies and assistits vital maintenance. Joe Cooper speculates that Cottingley is one of theseplaces described by Stringer, where the Telluric force makes certainmanifestations possible. Stringer, Lethbridge, Underwood and “ley hunters” likeJohn Michell seem to have arrived independently at the same basic theory ofearth forces. (Ley hunters point out that in many areas, ley lines are called“fairy paths.”)One interesting point quickly emerges from the various accounts of “fairies” orsimilar entities: the people who see them are almost invariably known to be“psychic.” Elsie Wright saw ghosts as well as fairies. The man whose sandwichwas stolen by a goblin later became a healer. The interviewer I spoke with inEdinburgh struck me as a typical Celt, and Celts seem to be more “psychic” thanSaxons. Yet they may be totally unaware that they are psychic until they happento find themselves in a place—like Ardachie Lodge near Loch Ness—where the“Telluric force” enters into a combination with their natural mediumship.Lethbridge was also psychic—all good dowsers are (since the faculties amount tothe same thing); so the sense of foreboding he experienced as he climbed downthe cliff on Skellig Michael was simply a sensitivity to the force associatedwith the place. But if that force could knock him on his face, then presumablyit was more than a tape-recording or “ghoul.”In his autobiography, A Foot in Both Worlds, Dr. Arthur Guirdham has also spokenof this sense of evil associated with certain places. He felt it as an Oxfordundergraduate, when he spent a vacation “cramming” at an inn in Beckley, on theedge of Otmoor.Otmoor was strange and haunted and out of this world, a sunken plain with lowhills around it . . . There was always a silence of something beautiful and evilabout it . . . Even in summer, with the roses blooming, there was about it amemory of old evil.And on the day he returned to Oxford, Guirdham experienced a peculiar fever. “Myteeth chattered harshly . . . I felt deathly cold . . . Next day I felt shrunkenwith cold and horribly ill.” Guirdham’s explanation is that Otmoor was one ofthe last places in England to harbor malaria, and that because of this, the“yellow men of Otmoor” were traditional in the Middle Ages. But there was nomalaria there for Guirdham to catch in the 1920s. He is convinced that hisunconscious mind had simply picked up the memory of these sufferings of thepast—what Lethbridge would call a ghoul—and begun to vibrate in tune with them,so to speak.Guirdham describes in the same book how, as a child, he saw a demon—although heseems to feel it was the Devil.I lay on my bed and felt his presence. The air was crackling and electric. Awave of vibration came to me through the door of my bedroom. When the wave ebbedquickly I was drawn towards the door . . . I knew he was calling and that theminute vibrations in the atmosphere were a summons to me. I went from my bedthrough the air palpitating with a new cold and opened the door, and he waswaiting for me . . .His face was hairy. It was covered, like his body, with a felt of blue-greyhair. He was man in his features and in his almost upright, slightly leaningposture . . . His legs were different. I was not aware of them as human. Theyended in the shaped stump of something like a hoof . . . There was a shiningaura about him . . .I do not know how I went to bed . . . After he had gone, the night was empty.In discussing this experience, Guirdham speculates whether his visitant was thegod Pan.This experience understandably affected Guirdham’s later attitude to mentalillness, particularly obsessive neurosis, and in a later book, Obsession, hemakes the bold suggestion that much mental illness may actually be due to thepresence of a force of evil which the patient is sensitive (i.e., clairvoyant)enough to pick up.Like Lethbridge, Dr. Guirdham believes that houses—particularly damp ones—canpick up negative vibrations; he has described a house in Bath, above anunderground stream, in which a number of successive tenants committed suicide orbecame mentally ill.But are such “vibrations” merely impressions or “tape recordings,” as Lethbridgebelieved? Or is some more active force involved? In 1935, Admiral H. BoyleSomerville, a member of Alfred Watkins’ Old Straight Track Club, accompaniedGeraldine Cummins, an Irish medium who specialized in automatic writing, to someancient stone circles in Ireland. Somerville wrote an account of the “automaticcommunications” that came through Geraldine Cummins. At a group of stones calledthe Three Fingers, near Castletownshend, County Cork, the pencil in GeraldineCummins’ hand wrote “Astor is here,” and then told Somerville to touch thestones. When he rested one hand on a stone, and the other on the hand of themedium, she began to write answers to his questions. At one point the scriptread:I see a picture now belonging to the second period [a period of ignorant worshipand primitive practices]. A tall man, a priest, near the stones, and the figureof a bound man being dragged forward. He is a heretic, I think. He does notbelieve, or he is a stranger; and they sacrifice him.It goes on to speak of a period of the Great Curse;They called on the Spirits of the Elements to guard these stones, and any man orstranger who disturbed or removed any one of them came under the power of theCurse. I see one stone being taken away at a later period. I see a woman wholived, I suppose, in the last century, for her dress is of that period. The menare removing the stone under her orders; I see the invisible Watcher who directsupon her the force of the Curse. All the male descendants of this woman arecursed. Nothing thrives with them, and they in their souls decay. For this isthe kind of a curse that assaults the soul. The men of this woman’s race havecome to no good in consequence, and have fallen on evil days. The curse does notseem to have fallen on the female side.Astor goes on to speak of another man, four or five centuries earlier, who hadalso incurred the curse by removing stones for building. “He and all his peopledied violent deaths in wars.” Astor went on to prophecy that the spot would oneday again become a spiritual center when “old wisdom will be rediscovered.”At the Drumbeg stone circle, in County Cork, on September 23, 1935, Astor statedflatly that he did not like the placefor I see that it is specially connected with a period of Nature-worship, orrather, an offshoot of Sun-worship, which became allied with Magic . . . I countback three thousand years at least. The Magic practiced here was connected withthe Sun in conjunction with the Moon. It seems that in mid-Winter there was avery striking ceremony performed here. Power was drawn from the earth, that isto say, when the Sun was at its lowest, an animal, if not a small child, wassacrificed for the purpose of securing the blood.After blood has been used in magical rites, “a Nature Spirit rises like a mistyshape out of the dish of blood.”Anyway, through the power of the Nature Spirits thus evoked, these men—“Tuathade Dananaan,” a name I get—these men are able in the coming year to control thetribe that occupied this region; for the elemental beings thus summoned have thepower, when re-used and used, to inflict injury, death or madness, as directedby their masters, the Magician-priests who made the circle.He goes on to describe a ceremony with dancing in which “men and women stabbedeach other in a frenzy . . . It drew the earth-power and the lower elementals tothe controlling Masters of Magic.”Then comes the interesting comment: “Many hundreds of years later there lingereda tradition concerning these elementals in the countryside, but they weredescribed as ‘fairies’ then, and the knowledge of their origin in connectionwith this circle was lost.” According to Astor, the circles were originallybuilt during “a period of pure worship, when these stones were connected withthe adoration of Creative Life.” This first period gave way to the second inwhich the original religion had become adulterated with magic.The reason that ill-luck is attached to this place is due to its being thecentre, at one time, for the evocation of the maleficent beings I have named.They set a curse upon the place . . . and the power of evil still lingers. If astone were removed, these elemental spirits would again obtain power to strikeat the human being who took the stone away.No, I dislike this place. I feel I had better stop writing, for I can’t getthrough to the time of a clearer, purer worship. The spirits of darkness guardthis place, and keep it as their own.[3]In 1944, a series of disturbances at the village of Great Leighs in Essexfollowed the removal of an ancient stone by the American army—it obstructed armytrucks, at the crossroads, trying to get into the camp. Journalist CharlesCurzon reports:Within hours of the stone’s removal, things began to happen. The bell in thechurch tower tolled in the small hours of the morning when nobody was near it.For several days running, the church clock struck midnight at two-thirty in themorning. Hens stopped laying. Chickens were found drowned in water butts . . .Farmer Ernest Withen of Chadwick’s Farm found his newly built stacks tumbled andspread all over his yard—although it had been a windless night. And his haywagons were all turned the wrong way round in his sheds . . . In CharlieDickson’s building yard, piles of heavy scaffolding poles, that needed a strongman to lift them, were found scattered like matchsticks . . . Thirty sheep andtwo horses were found dead in a field. Chickens in a run and rabbits in a hutchmysteriously changed places—and the fasteners of the hutch were found to beundisturbed . . . In the St. Anne’s Castle Inn, a bedroom suddenly becamehaunted. The furniture was thrown all over the place—a chest of drawers tippedon its side, bedclothes were strewn across the floor, a heavy wardrobe shiftedto another position. Mr. Sykes tidied it up. Next morning it was a shamblesagain.A week after the disturbances started, a group of men and women recovered theWitches Stone, from where the Americans had flung it, and in a midnightceremony, they replaced it at the crossroads, exactly where it had been forgenerations. The hauntings stopped from that moment. Curzon reports that theWitches Stone has since vanished completely, but the disturbances have notstarted again.A huge ancient stone called the Humber Stone, near my home town, Leicester, hassimilar legends associated with it. It is also known as the Hell, Holy and Hoststone, the last two suggesting it was once used for ritual purposes. It isbelieved to have been washed down the valley of the River Soar by an ice-ageglacier. At the time of writing (1981) the Leicester planning authorities arethinking of building a housing estate around the site of the stone, and the OldHumberstone Historical Society has been approached about the possibility ofexcavating it and superintending its removal.[4] In the Leicester Mercury, Mrs.J. Dailey of the Society is quoted as saying that the Society doesn’t want toexcavate because of what has happened to others. She speaks of a young man whoplaced a clock on top of the stone—and it promptly stopped; a clockmaker couldfind nothing mechanically wrong with it, but it still refused to start. Mrs.Bailey had an interesting suggestion about moving the stone: “Talk to it. Ibelieve that if you told it that it would be removed to a safe place where nodamage would come to it, there would be no trouble. I believe there would bedisastrous results otherwise.” This suggestion, which sounds preposterous intwentieth-century England, would still strike most Africans as perfectlyreasonable.The article mentions events that sound similar to the “curse” on the Irish stonecircles: in the nineteenth century, William Pochin of Barkby investigated theHumber Stone, and then had an accident with a firearm in which he blew off halfhis hand. The farmer who owned the land allowed his plough to break off parts ofthe stone in the eighteenth century; legend has it that he never againprospered, and died in the workhouse. A curate who covered over the stone (itwas almost totally buried in the ground in the early nineteenth century, as itis again today) was thrown from his gig shortly afterwards.Another issue of the Leicester Mercury[5] specifically suggests that the stoneis associated with “supernatural” forces. A ten-year-old boy named Billinghamstartled his art teacher by drawing a creature with a goat’s head, long curvinghorns, a man’s body and cloven hoofs. He explained that it was a thing he oftensaw at the end of his bed. The house he lived in was close to the Humber Stone.The boy’s mother subsequently decided to move from the house alleging it washaunted; the people who took it over also moved within two months. Mrs.Billingham said that she and her husband had once heard crying when the childrenwere in bed; they went to investigate and found they were quietly reading. “Myhusband and I saw a cat which jumped on our bed. We searched for it but couldn’tfind it. We never owned a cat. I felt I was never alone in that house.” In thiscase, the Humber Stone seems to affect several houses in the area. When theytold their neighbors why they were moving, the neighbors described waking up inthe middle of the night and seeing a monk in an attitude of prayer in theirbedroom. Two exorcisms had been carried out in nearby houses.A few days later, the Mercury followed up the earlier story. Mrs. Billingham’sparents still live in the area, and they contacted the reporter to report theirown experience. On one occasion, they stayed in the house overnight, lookingafter the children while the Billinghams were away,On the night in question we went to bed about 11 pm and fell asleep. However, Iwas roughly awakened, feeling that my life was being choked out of my body.Although I couldn’t see anyone in the darkness, I suffered the terriblesensation of being strangled and could actually feel someone—something—exertinga vice-like grip around my throat, so much that I was forced back into thepillow. It was not a nightmare. I was fully awake, but unable to scream. I shookmy husband from what seemed a trance-like slumber. He immediately switched onthe light, and although we couldn’t see anyone in the room, the temperature haddropped considerably. I was unable to utter a word for several minutes . . . [Idon’t know] whether it was because I am slightly psychic that the presence wasdrawn to me. I only know that I could sense evil in that house.Her husband, like Mrs. Billingham’s, never experienced anything unusual, but“did witness the extremely disturbing effects on his wife, daughter andgrandchild.”Reading this account, I was reminded of Diane Pritchard’s experiences with theBlack Monk. The fall in temperature, the sense of a presence in the room, allsound more like a poltergeist than a normal “haunting.” I obtained Mrs.Billingham’s new address from the Leicester Mercury and wrote to her, asking ifshe could tell me more about the experiences that drove her out of the house.She replied that it had all been so horrible that she had no desire to talkabout it—she merely wanted to forget it.In an article called “Gremlins at the Gates of Dawn,” Paul Devereux, editor ofThe Ley Hunter,[6] writes:It has been noted by earth mystery researchers from time to time that thingsoften seem to go wrong when ancient sites are being investigated: to use aromantic notion, as if some invisible guardian of a site is making thingsdifficult for the human investigators. Cameras inexplicably jam, accidentshappen, people are taken ill. An example happened to your editor in an aircraftover Wandlebury Camp . . . an expensive, newish camera internally fell apart atthe precise moment when infra-red pictures of the Gog Magog figures [firstdiscovered by Lethbridge] were to be taken. Yet the camera had functionedperfectly before take-off.And the article goes on to describe at length all kinds of mishaps thataccompanied a trip to photograph the winter solstice sunrise at the Castle Riggstone circle in Cumbria.The travel writer Laurens Van der Post describes a similar incident in book TheLost World of the Kalahari, when his expedition, seeking the vanished bushmen ofSouth Africa, approached a place called the Slippery Hills. Their guide,Samutchoso, had insisted that there should be no shooting of game as theyapproached, or the gods would be angry. Van der Post had forgotten to tell theadvance party, and they shot a wart-hog, to Samutchoso’s alarm. From then on,everything went wrong. They were attacked by wild bees, and all stung. When amovie camera was focused on a rock-painting, it promptly jammed, although themagazine was new. They loaded another magazine, it jammed again. The same thinghappened to a third magazine. In a natural amphitheatre, Samutchoso knelt topray, but was pulled violently backwards, tearing both his knees. The advanceparty returned to camp to collect more magazines; these all jammed just aspromptly. At dawn they were invaded by more bees. And as soon as they began totry to film again, the camera jammed, and continued to do so for the rest of theday. Their tape recorder simply went dead. The next day, it was the same storyall over again, from the dawn attack by bees. A steel swivel of a camera—soreliable that no spare was carried—also failed.Finally, Samutchoso offered to consult the spirits by a traditional method, inwhich a needle was placed along the lifeline on the palm of his hand, and hestared into it. As Van der Post and the party watched, they heard a one-wayconversation, during which Samutchoso broke off periodically to listen to thespirits. Finally, Samutchos told Van der Post: “It is as I thought, the spiritsof the hills are very angry with you, so angry that if they had not known yourintention in coming here was pure they would long since have killed you. Theyare angry because you have come with blood on your hands.”Van der Post thought of an expedient to placate the spirits; he wrote a note ofhumble apology, made everyone sign it, and buried it in a ledge. Then Samutchosoagain consulted the spirits, and told Van der Post that all would now be well.The spirits also warned him that he would find bad news at the next place hewent to; in fact, he learned that his father had died.Samutchoso’s experience when trying to pray sounds like what happened toLethbridge on Skellig Michael when something threw him on his face. And this inturn suggests that what Lethbridge encountered was not, strictly speaking, apoltergeist, but some kind of “elemental.” (This does not, of course, precludethe possibility that poltergeists are some kind of elemental.)In Africa, the reality of spirits is taken for granted, and many white men whohave had experience of Africa have also learned to accept their reality. InJu-ju in My Life, James H. Neal, former chief investigation officer for theGovernment of Ghana, tells of his own first acquaintance with spirits. A portwas being built at Tema, and a small tree defied all efforts to move it—evenbulldozers were unable to tear it out of the ground. The African foremanexplained that it was a fetich—was inhabited by a spirit, and that a fetichpriest would have to be called. The priest asked for three sheep, three bottlesof gin, and a hundred pounds if he succeeded. The blood of the sheep wassprinkled around the tree, then the gin; then the priest went into a trance andbegged the spirit to vacate it for a more suitable home. After various rituals,the priest announced that the spirit had agreed to leave. A small team of menthen pulled the tree out with a rope.Another psychical researcher, Leonard Boucher (whom we shall meet again inchapter Seven), has a similar story about a tree in Tema, near Accra, Ghana.When plans were drawn up for the construction of a new hotel, it was decidedthat an old tree would have to be cut down—otherwise, it would impede the viewfrom the lounge window. The tree had been a meeting place of ju-ju men overcenturies, and the local ju-ju man informed the builders that it would beimpossible to cut it down—it was the dwelling place of the spirit of an ancientchief. The management ignored him, and told the builders to go ahead and removeit. But this proved to be more difficult than expected. Saws broke, men manningthe bulldozer became ill, the ground hardened like concrete and, after all theirefforts, the tree still remained intact. Finally, African workers on the siterefused to make any further attempt to destroy the tree—it is still to be seentoday outside the middle of the lounge picture window.In the appendix of my book Rasputin and the Fall of the Romanovs, I have printeda story told to me by a friend, Martin Delany, who was managing director of acompany in Nigeria. A hen flew into the saw of a Brenta band-saw and was cut topieces, and the Nigerian workers were alarmed, declaring that the god was angry,and would have to be appeased with blood. Martin refused, because it involvedthe sacrifice of a puppy dog. Two days later, another hen flew into the blade.When the saw began to cut unevenly, it was stopped and the electricity turnedoff at the main. As soon as the manager began to examine it, the blade turnedand almost severed his hand. Engineers who examined the saw said it was animpossibility. Finally, the saw blade began to “strip” when in use, and the ballof tangled metal killed the operator. At this point, Martin Delany allowed thewitch doctor to make the sacrifice; and all trouble immediately ceased. From thepoint of view of the present chapter, the main interest of the story is the waythat the saw began to turn even when switched off at the main. We have alreadynoted that poltergeists seem to have the power to create electric currents.But stories of curses are as common to England as to Africa. I know of a villagein Cornwall where no one dares to touch a rather dangerous yew in a churchyardbecause there is a belief that anyone who does so will die, and this is whathappened to the last man who tried to cut it down. Usually, in such cases, thereis a story of a curse laid by a witch. In The Folklore of Cornwall, Tony Deaneand Tony Shaw mention that there are two fields in Cornwall that are nevertilled because they are cursed. One is at Mullion, the other at Padstow. Thelatter is at Lower Harlyn Farm, now farmed by a Mr. Bennett. The “curse” waslaid in the nineteenth century when a cargo of pilchards was dumped in thefield; the Italian buyers refused to purchase them because they were tooexpensive. The villagers were starving, but were refused permission to touch thepilchards. A witch named Mother Ivey cursed the field (presumably to discomfortthe farmer), saying that if anyone tried to plough it, the eldest son would die.When an eldest son was thrown from his horse and killed in the field, there wereno further attempts at ploughing. But during the Second World War, the HomeGuard dug trenches in it. The eldest son—the present owner’s father—was killedshortly afterwards. The owner, a Mr. Hellyar, has said in an article that hewould need a very good reason for trying to cultivate the field. Mrs. Mary Rees,the joint owner of the field, has attempted to break the curse by burying ragsin a tin—obtained from a witch—in the field; but Mr. Bennett, the tenant farmer,refuses to be convinced.chapter V of Conan Doyle’s Coming of the Fairies is called “Observations of aClairvoyant in the Cottingley Glen, August 1921.” The clairvoyant was a mannamed Geoffrey Hodson, a member of the Theosophical Society. In their YorkshireTelevision interview, Elsie and Frances indicate that they regarded him as a“phoney”; yet this is hardly borne out by his books. Still, both Elsie andFrances insist they did see fairies with Hodson, even though they exaggeratedwhat they saw to pull his leg. (They add, interestingly, that they never sawfairies again after this.) In 1952, Hodson published a small book called Fairiesat Work and Play, introduced by Edward Gardner, the man who “discovered” Elsieand Frances. Gardner explains the traditional “occult”’ belief that manpossesses an “astral body,” which can leave the physical body under certaincircumstances—a matter we shall discuss in a later chapter. The astral body issaid to be made of matter at a higher rate of vibration than physical matter.The human aura—a kind of energy that interpenetrates the human body—also seemsto belong to this realm. According to Gardner, fairies and other such elementalsbelong on this level. Clairvoyants are able to see or sense this realm ofvibrations which, according to Gardner, explains how Elsie and Frances could seefairies. One of the purposes of fairies, or nature spirits (sometimes calleddevas, a Hindu word) is to aid the growth of plants and seeds, hence theirassociation with the woodland and open countryside and their absence in built-upareas. According to Gardner:None of the fairies, gnomes nor higher devas, can be said to have a fixed“solid” body, as we understand the term. They may occasionally materialize,often using as the basis of this “materialization” the thoughtforms thatpeasants and children have built of them. [my italics]The latter comment seems to explain why Marc Alexander’s friend saw an Englishpixie in New Zealand. “The elemental life rejoices to jump into a ready-madethought-form as much as an active child delights in dressing up.” He adds thatthe natural form of elementals seems to be a “pulsing globe of light.”Hodson’s book certainly provides the skeptic with plenty of material forsatirical comment: brownies who affect a medieval style of attire, gnomes of“grotesque appearance, cadaverous and lantern-jawed,” and black or peat brown incolor; undines—water sprites—who are beautiful nude females, about six incheslong, and Manx fairies with “soft and dreamy eyes.” Yet his descriptionscorrespond closely to dozens of others on record. His description of a “crimsonnature deva” is impressive:After a scramble of several hundred feet up a rocky glen we turned out to oneside, on to the open fell where it faces a huge crag. Immediately on reachingthe open we became aware, with startling suddenness, of the presence of a greatnature-deva, who appeared to be partly within the hillside.My first impression was of a huge, brilliant crimson, bat-like thing, whichfixed a pair of burning eyes upon me. The form was not concentrated into a truehuman shape, but was somehow spread out like a bat with a human face and eyes,and with wings outstretched over the mountainside. As soon as it felt itself tobe observed, it flashed into its proper shape, as if to confront us, fixed itspiercing eyes upon us, and then sank into the hillside and disappeared.He describes “tree devas” among a group of old firs and comments: “The naturespirits do not appear to be individualized as yet, working under a groupconsciousness,” a point that may be worth bearing in mind when considering themore traditional poltergeist. When human beings lack a sense of identity, theyoften do apparently pointless things, simply to give themselves a sense ofexistence-through-action; this could explain the apparently aimless mischief ofthe poltergeist.It is to the “earth devas” that the community at Findhorn, in Scotland,attributes its astonishing success in horticulture. In 1978, after a visit tothe Edinburgh Festival, I spent a few days there to gain some first-handimpressions of this unusual community. It is situated on a bare spit of landsticking out into the Moray Firth, close to the town of Forres, and at firstsight looks like any holiday site, with chalets and caravans. It had beenfounded in the early 1960s by Peter and Eileen Caddy, after Peter Caddy had losthis job as a hotel manager. Ever since a day in Glastonbury many years earlier,Eileen Caddy had been receiving “guidance” through some kind of inner voice.This voice now led them to live in a caravan on the bleak, sandy wastes of theForres peninsula. They had no money, and Peter Caddy decided that they ought togrow their own food. But the sandy ground seemed completely unsuitable. Theyused seaweed and manure from local horses as fertilizer, while Eileen’s voicesassured them that all would be well. And the vegetables, when they began togrow, were extraordinary—giant cabbages and marrows and lettuces.When I was at Findhorn, there were no longer giant vegetables—they explainedthat the purpose of these vegetables had been to demonstrate conclusively whatcould be done with love and “guidance.” But the gardens were certainly anastonishing sight on that windy peninsula, with their magnificent beds offlowers.I am not “community-minded.” On the few occasions in my life when I have spentsome time in communities—whether monastic or just vaguely “spiritual”—I haveusually felt awkward and out-of-place, totally unable to share the group-spirit.Findhorn was an interesting exception. There was a great deal of talk about loveand cooperation and guidance, yet the atmosphere seemed so friendly and normalthat I felt perfectly at home there. It was strange to talk to people whoclaimed to have had contact with—and even seen—nature devas and fairies; yet atno point did I feel that I was among cranks, or even mystics.A book, The Magic of Findhorn, by Paul Hawken, speaks at length about thesenature spirits. In 1966, a scholar named Robert Ogilvie Crombie—known asRoc—came to help at Findhorn. Crombie describes to Hawken how, in March 1966, hewas walking in the Edinburgh Royal Botanic Gardens when he experienced a stateof heightened perception, then became aware “out of the corner of his eye,” of anature spirit in the form of the god Pan. “I could see shaggy legs and clovenhooves, pointed chin and ears, and two little horns on his forehead . . . He wasnaked, but his legs were covered with fine hair.” When Ogilvie said “Hello,” thecreature looked startled and asked: “Can you see me?” “Yes.” “I don’t believeit. Humans can’t see us.”“He told me,” said Crombie, “that he lived in the Garden, and that his work wasto help the growth of the trees. He went on to say that the Nature Spirits hadlost interest in humans, since they have been made to feel that they are neitherbelieved in nor wanted. He thought that men were foolish to think that theycould do without the Nature spirits.”Crombie’s account sounds like a piece of whimsy by Sir James Barrie; yet hisdescriptions of his encounters with nature spirits are precise andcircumstantial. He speaks of an encounter with a faun, and with some kind ofnature deva. “He stepped behind me and then walked into me so that we became oneand I saw the surroundings through his eyes . . . The moment he stepped into me,the woods became alive with myriads of beings—elementals, nymphs, dryads, fauns,elves, gnomes, fairies . . . The Nature Spirits love and delight in the workthey do and have to express this in movement.”Crombie and Peter Caddy met in 1965, and, according to Hawken, Crombie becameCaddy’s “ambassador” to the world of Nature Spirits. They were together at theFaery Glen, at Rosemarkie, when Crombie claimed to have encountered elves—whichwere invisible to Caddy; they were highly hostile because of the damage that hasbeen done by man to the Glen. Crombie returned to Findhorn with Caddy, and“brought with him this intimate contact with the Nature Kingdom and Pan. Hesought their help and cooperation in making the gardens an example of what couldbe accomplished among Man, the Devas and the Nature Spirits. He was told by Panthat a ‘wild area’ should be established in the garden to serve as a sanctuaryfor the Nature Spirits . . .” All this was to be done in close cooperation withnature. When Peter Caddy cut down some gorse bushes in blossom, Crombieencountered some furious elves, and had to explain to them that man may beignorant and tactless, but is not fundamentally wicked.Hawken describes a conversation with two of the chief gardeners.I asked Mathew and Leonard about Nature Spirits, and whether in “working” withthem they actually perceived them. Both said that they did not perceive themdirectly, but both felt that they were intuitively guided by the Nature Spirits.Leonard told the story of how he went to several deeply-rooted bushes a few daysbefore they had to be removed and quietly told them why they had to be moved.When the day came to remove them they could easily be pulled out of the groundwith one hand as if they had completely released their “hold” on life. Forcomparison, Leonard went to one of the bushes that was not to be taken out andpulled on it. It wouldn’t budge.While at Findhorn, I mentioned that I have endless trouble with moles in mygarden, and was told that they had also had the same problem, briefly; all thathad been necessary was to explain to the moles that this was now a garden, andto ask them politely if they would mind moving elsewhere. The next day, themoles had moved out to more distant fields.All this sounds preposterous only if we happen to be unaware that reports ofthese elementals and nature spirits have come from all parts of the earth andall ages. It is, of course, quite possible that it is all imagination andwishful thinking. But this is largely a matter of our “common sense” prejudices.The annals of the Society for Psychical Research are full of so many thousandsof well-authenticated stories of poltergeists, apparitions and “specters of theliving” that we can accept that they may have some basis in fact. It seems quiteconceivable that “mediums” may be able to see things that are not visible tonon-mediums. But when mediums claim to have seen fairies or elves, we becomeskeptical. The two-volume Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology containsan interesting entry under “Fairy Investigation Society.”Formed in Britain to collate information on fairy sightings in modern times,with membership from various countries. The Society used to publish anoccasional Newsletter, but this has been suspended in recent years. It was foundthat although reports of Unidentified Flying Objects received tolerant publicnotice, reports of fairy sightings encouraged press ridicule. The Society is atpresent quiescent, but is planning to reorganize on a basis which will protectmembers from undesirable notice.In fact, fairy sightings are just as commonplace as UFO sightings, and just ascircumstantial. Joe Cooper devotes a chapter of his book to sightings that hehas personally noted down—for example, the group of Bradford students who sawfairies “who were circling and dancing” and were invisible to a direct gaze butdiscernible “at the corners of the eye.” (This is a phrase that occursrepeatedly in fairy sightings.) Cooper goes on to mention the investigationscarried out in Ireland by W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, which they recorded in abook, Visions and Beliefs, in 1920. A typical example is of a Mr. and Mrs.Kelleher of Wicklow, who told Yeats: “We had one of them in the house for awhile . . . It was in winter and there was snow on the ground, and I saw one ofthem outside, and I brought him in and put him on the dresser and he stopped inthe house for a while, for about a week.” His wife interrupted him to say: “Itwas more than that, it was two or three weeks.” Mr. Kelleher goes on: “He wasabout fifteen inches high. He was very friendly . . . When the boys at thepublic house were full of porter, they used to come into the house to look athim, and they would laugh to see him but I never let them hurt him.”When Chesterton met Yeats, he was struck by his down-to-earth attitude tofairies.“Imagination!” he would say with withering contempt; “There wasn’t muchimagination when Farmer Hogan was dragged out of bed and thrashed like a sack ofpotatoes—that they did, they had ’um out and thumped ’um, and that’s not thesort of thing a man wants to imagine.” But the concrete examples were not only acomedy; he used one argument which was sound, and I have never forgotten it. Itis the fact that it is not abnormal men like artists but normal men likepeasants, who have borne witness a thousand times to such things; “it is thefarmers who see the fairies.”It was a meeting with Yeats, and with his friend George Russell—the mystic“AE”—that led Evans-Wentz to begin the studies that led to his book The FairyFaith in Celtic Countries. In this book he explains what he calls the“psychological theory” of fairy sightings—which is not, as might be supposed, anattempt to dismiss them as figments of the imagination. His theory is that it isthe experience of nature in such countries as Ireland and Scotland that “impressman and awaken in him some unfamiliar part of himself—call it the SubconsciousSelf, the Subliminal Self, the Ego, or what you will—which gives him the unusualpower to know and to feel invisible or psychical influences. What is there, forexample, in London, or Paris, or Berlin, or New York to awaken the intuitivepower of man, that subconsciousness deep-hidden in him?”One of the most fascinating parts of his book is an interview with “AE,” underthe title “An Irish Mystic’s Testimony.” George Russell began to have “visions”at the time of puberty, when he was torn by sexual conflicts. He had his firstmystical vision lying on the hill of Kilmasheogue, when “the heart of the hillsopened to me, and I knew there was no hill for those who were there, and theywere unconscious of the ponderous mountains piled above the palaces of light.”Evans-Wentz asked him about the sidhe or fairies (the same word as Lethbridge’s“sith”), and Russell replied that he divided them into two classes: those whichare shining, and those which are opalescent and seem to shine by a light withinthemselves. “The shining beings appear to be lower in the hierarchies; theopalescent beings are more rarely seen and appear to hold the position of greatchief . . .” Asked under what conditions he saw fairies, Russell replied:I have seen them most frequently after being away from a city or town for a fewdays. The whole west coast of Ireland, from Donegal to Kerry, seems charged witha magical power, and I find it easiest to see when I am there. I have found itcomparatively easy to see visions while at ancient monuments [i.e., stonecircles and monoliths] like New Grange and Dowth because I think such places arenaturally charged with psychical forces, and were for that reason made use oflong ago assacred places.Asked about the shining beings, Russell replies:It is very difficult to give an intelligible description of them. The first timeI saw them with great vividness I was lying on a hill-side alone in the west ofIreland, in County Sligo: I had been listening to music in the air, and to whatseemed to be the sound of bells, and was trying to understand these aerialclashings in which wind seemed to break upon wind in an ever-changing musicalsilvery sound. Then the space before me grew luminous, and I began to see onebeautiful being after another.He describes the “opalescent beings”:There was at first a dazzle of light, and then I saw that this came from theheart of a tall figure with a body apparently shaped out of half-translucent oropalescent air, and throughout the body ran a radiant electrical fire, to whichthe heart seemed to be the centre. Around the head of this being and through itswaving luminous hair, which was blown all about the body like living strands ofgold, there appeared flaming wing-like auras.He states that he has had many similar visions, and “I believe they correspondin a general way to the Tuatha De Danann or ancient Irish gods.” This was thephrase mentioned in Geraldine Cummins’ automatic script at the Drumbeg StoneCircle.Significantly, Russell says that “among the shining orders there does not seemto be any individualized life . . . Theirs is, I think, a collective life, sounindividualized and so calm that I might have more varied thoughts in fivehours than they would have in five years.” Asked if these beings might be“inimical to humanity,” Russell says that he certainly never felt this about theshining beings. “But the water beings, also of the shining tribes, I alwaysdread, because I felt whenever I come into contact with them a great drowsinessof mind and, I often thought, an actual drawing away of vitality.” Asked ifthere is a resemblance between lower Sidhe orders and elementals, Russellreplies: “The lower orders of the Sidhe are, I think, the nature elementals ofthe medieval mystics.”What is so important about Russell’s testimony is that we know we are notdealing with a crank or a liar. Books like Candle of Vision and Song and ItsFoundation carry their own mark of authenticity; this man is a genuine mysticwith more than a touch of literary genius. Moreover, Russell’s comments on the“power” of the earth at sacred sites—and these comments were made about 1910,before anyone had heard of ley lines—is independently confirmed by Lethbridgeand other sources. Like Crombie at Findhorn, Russell was usually in a state of“heightened awareness” when he saw his visions of the Sidhe.Evans-Wentz makes the important point that the faculty to see fairies orelementals is no different in kind from the faculty to see ghosts or spirits.This is confirmed by one of the most interesting records of “clairvoyance” ofthe nineteenth century: the diary edited by Cyril Scott under the title The BoyWho Saw True. Although anonymous, the diary carries a strong air ofauthenticity—Scott received it from the widow of the diarist after his death. Inlater life the diarist commented:As far back as I can remember I have been clairvoyant, and could see thedisembodied entities and the human aura, which I referred to as “the lights.”All the same, I had never heard of clairvoyance, and imagined it was a naturalfaculty which everybody possessed, like the five senses.He saw Jesus standing at the end of his bed on several occasions, and also sawdead relatives. (When he reported this to his parents they usually got veryangry; they consulted an occulist and a doctor to find out what was wrong withhim.) Having made up his mind to avoid a little girl who wanted to playsex-games, he told his mother:I didn’t tell her I was cross with Marjorie because she was always begging me totake down my pantaloons. I just told her I wanted to be by myself and watch thefairies playing among the stones and seaweed on the sea shore—which was true.And then she got very vexed and said she really didn’t know what she was goingto do with a little boy that was so untruthful . . .Later he writes:There is a lovely old tree in Uncle John’s garden, and today I sat a long timewatching a funny old gnome who lives inside it, like one of the gnomes in myfairy-tale book. He has great long thin legs and wears a red cap, though therest of him is like the colour of the trunk of the tree. Some times he comes outof his tree and goes prancing about in the grass and looking so funny that Iwanted to giggle, but was afraid I might make him offended.At Keswick, on holiday, he records: “We have been here for a week now, and Ihave seen crowds of fairies and elves and mannikins and gnomes, and it’s simplylovely.”On holiday at Harlech, in Wales, the boy again saw his deceased grandfather inthe room, and was told by him that he would find it easier to see things herebecause the nature forces were so strong. And when the party went on a picnic tostanding stones, the boy records: “I was able to see a lot of queer looking mendressed in long clothes sort of praying and doing peculiar things . . .”In one interesting passage toward the end of the diary, the boy describes avisit to a “fortune teller” (who seems to be a spirit medium) with his tutor. Heis able to see the spirit of a Red Indian “hanging about,” and when she goesinto a trance, the spirit “disappears” inside her, suggesting that mediumshipmay be a form of “possession.” Another spirit is described as trying to getinside her “but didn’t seem to be able to manage it properly,” and the words thespirits speak to her become jumbled and incomprehensible when she repeats them—apoint worth bearing in mind when studying the séance utterances of mediums. Itseems clear that the writer often finds spirits rather comic and pretentious—asin an early entry when a spirit who seems to be a clergyman delivers a “message”full of religious platitudes.In an entry for January 24, 1887, the boy reports a “spirit” as saying that somesouls who didn’t want to come back to earth again (presumably in reincarnatedform) can become devas, “or sort of gods or what we imagine are angels.” He alsostates that some devas become attached to a human being and become a person onearth “so as to be close to the person they love.”He contended that stories about fairies becoming ordinary people like we are andyou meet with in fairy tales are not all flapdoodle. He then told us thequeerest thing of all. He stated that ages ago, I had been a deva . . . BecauseI’d been a deva, I was able to see a lot of things other people couldn’t see . ..It is a pity that Scott was unable to provide better evidence of the diary’sauthenticity (although his own account of the diarist’s later life, andquotations from his letters, are certainly convincing). It contains much thatseems to support views we have encountered elsewhere. The notion of spiritsreborn as devas or angels rather than as human beings sounds as if it comesstraight out of Kardec. “Devas who become attached to human beings” sounds likethe “higher selves” encountered in some cases of multiple personality—like DorisFischer’s “guardian angel.” What the diarist has to say about “lights” can befound in many books on the “human aura,” and has been made the subject of animportant study by Dr. Shafica Karagulla, a brain physiologist who becameconvinced that many doctors have an intuitive ability to diagnose illnessthrough the “energy field” of the patient.From the point of view of the present chapter, one of the most interestingpassages in the book is the grandfather’s comments about the Harlech area, thatthis is a very old part of the world and used to be part of a huge continentcalled Atlantis or some such name, most of which had gone down under the sea,and that the something or other, I’ve forgotten the words (probablyNature-forces) were very strong and would help me see things.It was John Michell’s book The View Over Atlantis (1969) that first put forwardthe notion—which we have already encountered in Stephen Jenkins—that there is aconnection between nature forces at specific places and “supernatural”manifestations. Michell devotes special attention to the Great Pyramid,Stonehenge, and Glastonbury Tor. The last is believed to be one of the oldestsacred sites in England, and the point of intersection of a large number of “leylines.” And between 1908 and 1920 Glastonbury was the subject of a remarkableseries of experiments that are often cited as conclusive proof of the existenceof “supernatural intelligences.”Glastonbury Abbey was founded in the fifth century (according to tradition, bySt. Patrick) and was destroyed under Henry the Eighth, who was anxious toacquire its land and revenues. Within a few generations, much of the Abbey hadbeen used by local farmers for building. In 1907, the ruins of the Abbey werebought by the nation for £30,000, and an architect named Frederick Bligh Bondwas appointed to take charge of the excavations.What the Church of England—Bond’s employers—did not know was that he was deeplyinterested in Spiritualism, having been an enthusiastic student of CatherineCrowe’s Night Side of Nature since his teens. One of the chief problems inexcavating the abbey was simply to know where to start digging. Old recordssuggested the existence of two chapels, built in the last few decades of theabbey’s existence as a monastic order; but no plans existed, and no one knewwhere to start looking. Bond decided to ask the cooperation of a friend namedJohn Allen Bartlett, who was able to produce automatic writing. On the afternoonof November 7, 1907, Bartlett and Bond sat on opposite sides of a table inBond’s Bristol office, Bartlett holding a pencil over a sheet of paper, andBond’s own hand resting very lightly on top of it. Bond asked aloud thequestion: “Can you tell us anything about Glastonbury?” and the hand wroterapidly: “All knowledge is eternal and is available to mental sympathy. I wasnot in sympathy with the monks—I cannot find a monk yet.” But soon thisdifficulty was overcome, and Bartlett’s hand was swiftly drawing an outline planof the abbey, with a long rectangle stuck on its eastern end. It was signed“Gulielmus Monachus”—William the Monk. Bligh Bond thought the rectangle lookedtoo big to be the missing chapel and asked for more information. “William theMonk” insisted that this was correct, and made a more precise drawing. He saidit was the Edgar chapel, built by Abbot Bere. Another monk who called himselfJohannes Bryant, monk and lapidator (stonemason) added more details.Some of the communications were in Latin, some in Old English. The invisiblecommunicators claimed to include Abbot Bere (the last abbot but one), Ambrosiusthe Cellarer, and Peter Lightfoot the clockmaker, as well as those alreadymentioned. Eventually, they were to provide detailed accounts—including theexact dimensions and color of the stained glass—of two chapels, the Edgar andLoretto chapels. They also mentioned two towers that had existed in the west endof the building, underground passages, and various other items that were totallyunknown.In 1908 the money for the excavations was obtained. Bond’s workmen began to digbeyond the east wall. Soon they came upon a huge and unsuspected wall runningnorth for thirty-one feet. Bond had found the Edgar Chapel, and its dimensionsturned out to be exactly those that had been given by the monks. They had toldhim the chapel would be ninety feet long, which seemed too large. It proved tobe eighty-seven feet long, and the wall and plinth added another three feet. Thewindows proved to be azure-colored, as the monks had foretold. Abbot Bere saidthe roof had been painted in gold and crimson; fragments of arch mouldings stillhad gold and crimson paint on them.Bond’s employers were delighted and astounded at his success; it seemed to themincredibly good luck that he seemed to dig trenches just where they wouldintersect a wall. Bond, understandably, decided to keep his source ofinformation secret. The Church of England has always been thoroughly ambivalentabout Spiritualism. Although Christians believe in life after death, the Churchhas always declined to be convinced that the “dead” who communicate at séancesare really what they claim to be (an attitude, we have seen, that is to someextent justified). As late as 1936, the Archbishop of Canterbury commissioned astudy on Spiritualism which eventually came up with the finding that its claimsare probably true, and that there is no contradiction between its beliefs andthat of the Church; the report was promptly suppressed.So Bond decided to keep his own council about his “communicators,” who calledthemselves the “Company of Glastonbury” or the “Watchers from the Other Side.”At times, this must have been difficult. Digging on the south side of the nave,looking for the towers (which proved to be exactly where the monks said theywould be), Bond came upon a skeleton of a man almost seven feet fall. Betweenhis legs there was another skull. It could hardly have been a case of murder,since the head of the skeleton rested on a stone cradle. Then why no coffin, andwhose was the other skull in the grave? Bond asked his communicators, and theyprovided a prompt explanation. The skeleton—which was almost seven feet fall—wasthat of Radulphus Cancellarius, Ralph the Chancellor, a Norman who slew Eawulfthe Saxon in fair fight. Eawulf was buried, and Ralph the Norman lived on formany years, although his bones had been broken by Eawulf’s axe. It was an oddcoincidence that Eawulf’s skull should have turned up in the grave. Ralph askedto be buried outside the church he loved so much; Eawulf had been buried nearby,and his skull rolled into the grave . . .The communicators said that Ralph was the treasurer in the time of AbbotThurstan, the first Norman abbot of Glastonbury. When William the Conqueror cameto England in 1066, he installed his own Benedictine abbot on the Irish orderalready at Glastonbury. There was trouble, and some of the Irish monks werekilled by Normans. Eawulf, according to the communicator, was the Earl ofEdgarley, a nearby village, who was angry about the killings, and engaged Ralphin a combat which led to his own death.There was no historical record of an Earl of Edgarley, so Bond set out to findone. After many years, he found an entry in the Chronicle of Fabius Ethelwerd,dated 866 a.d. which mentioned “Eanulf,” a nobleman of Somerset, who was buriedat Glastonbury; that might well be an ancestor of the later Eawulf—but Eanulf isnot Eawulf, and a nobleman of Somerset is not necessarily the Earl of Edgarley.But the chronicle mentioned that Eanulf had died in the same year as BishopEalhstan of Scireburn. Then, in a chronicle called Annals of the Exploits ofAlfred, dated 855 a.d., Bond found a reference to Eanwulf, earl of the districtof Summurton, who had died at the same time as Bishop Ealhstan ofSherburne—obviously the same person. Summerton (Somerton) is a village close toEdgarley. And Eanwulf is spelled with both the n and w. So this Eanwulf wasclearly an ancestor of the one who died in fair fight with Ralph the Chancellor,and he was, like his descendant, buried at Glastonbury. Obviously, the long-deadmonks were right again. Moreover, when Bond examined the skeleton of Ralph, hefound the forearm had been broken, as if from the blow of an axe, and had healedagain—again supporting the story of the Watchers. The communicator added thatthe monks of Glaston had their reward, for a Saxon again was abbot for a time.History was able to confirm this: Abbot Thurstan’s excesses caused his removalby William the Conquerer, and he was succeeded by the Saxon Herlewin.By about 1917, Bond felt that it would probably be safe enough to tell the fullstory—after all, his excavations had been spectacularly successful. Besides, theWatchers told him that their aim was that Glastonbury should once again berecognized as a major spiritual center, and telling the full story must haveseemed to Bond the first step in that direction. So he wrote a book called Gateof Remembrance, in which all the communications are printed in full, togetherwith the story of Ralph and Eawulf, and many others that are equally fascinating(for example, how the monks made their fatal mistake in inviting Henry theEighth as guest to the abbey, hoping to gain his goodwill; they only succeededin arousing his greed, and their downfall was assured). Gate of Remembrance cameout in 1918. And Bond very quickly found himself out of a job. The Church ofEngland was outraged to find that it had been—even inadvertently—involved inSpiritualism. Bond was squeezed out; by 1921 he had been reduced to cleaning andcataloguing the discoveries at £10 a month; by 1922, excavations at Glastonburyhad been stopped, and he was unemployed. The Church even ordered that his booksshould not be sold at the abbey bookshop, an order which applies to this day.Bond went to America, lectured widely about his experiences, and became activein psychical research. But he was never allowed to return to Glastonbury—at onepoint, there was even an order forbidding him to enter the grounds. He continuedto receive communications about the abbey—about underground passages, buriedtreasure, even about King Arthur and the Holy Grail (a skeleton believed to bethat of Arthur was discovered at Glastonbury in 1190, with an inscription: “Herelies the renowned Arthur in the Isle of Avalon”). In later years, a group ofAmericans succeeded in getting permission to dig at Glastonbury—intending tofollow up this information; but as soon as it leaked out that Bond wasassociated with the group, the trustees withdrew permission.Oddly enough, Bond himself did not take it for granted that the “Watchers” weredead monks; he thought that it might have been his own unconscious mind—the samepart of the mind that seems to be able to locate underground water with adivining rod, or even dowse for water over a map. But this was typical of Bond.He refused to allow his remarkable success to influence his judgment as ascholar.He died in 1945, in his eightieth year. The “communications” of his later yearsstill await investigation; if they prove to be half as accurate as the earlierones, the results should be very remarkable indeed. And to some extent, hisfaith in Glastonbury—and that of the Watchers—has been justified. Since Bondleft the abbey, Glastonbury has become increasingly a center of artistic andspiritual activity. The composer Rutland Boughton tried to turn it into anEnglish Bayreuth, and wrote a number of huge operas on King Arthur; butBoughton’s socialism incensed the conservative people of Glastonbury and hisplans collapsed. John Cowper Powys’ novel, A Glastonbury Romance, is one of thegreatest novels of the twentieth century, and its nature mysticism catchessomething of the essence of that extraordinary area that was once King Arthur’sAvalon. Margaret Murray was living in Glastonbury when she stumbled upon theidea—which has since become a commonplace—that witchcraft (or “wicca”) was apagan religion of nature worship, and that it has continued secretly down thecenturies in this form. The occultist Dion Fortune—one of the early members ofthe magical Order of the Golden Dawn—moved to Glastonbury, and spent the secondpart of her life studying occultism in her house at the foot of Glastonbury Tor.Geoffrey Ashe, the author of King Arthur’s Avalon, now lives in the house; thechalet in which Dion Fortune practiced her magical rites is haunted by a ghostthat opens and closes doors and is occasionally seen as a shape in the darkness.We have already noted that Eileen Caddy first heard her “voices” in Glastonbury.And when, in 1969, John Michell’s View Over Atlantis described Glastonbury asone of the major “nodal points” of ley lines, the result was the “hippyinvasion” of Glastonbury that reached a climax in the mid-1970s.In The Undiscovered Country, Stephen Jenkins mentions that when he was studyingBuddhism in Tibet, he asked his guru about Shambhala, the legendary sacred placeof the ancient Hindus. He was told that it was located in England, at the placenow called Glastonbury.[1] Francis Griffiths passed away in 1986 at the age of 78; Elsie Wright passedaway in 1988 at the age of 87.[2].

R. G. Owen’s Can We Explain the Poltergeist?, William Roll’sThe Poltergeist, and Poltergeists by Alan Gauld and Tony Cornell. All threeraise the question of whether poltergeists could be spirits of the dead or othertypes of disembodied entity; all three decide that this is unlikely, and thattherefore poltergeists are probably some kind of manifestation of theunconscious mind: that is, of “spontaneous psychokinesis.” Owen points out thata large number of children in poltergeist cases have mental problems; Roll notesthat most objects tends to move counterclockwise, and suggests that there issome kind of whirlpool or psychic vortex that drags them into motion. But no oneexplains why poltergeist effects are so much more powerful than the kind ofpsychokinesis that has been studied in the laboratory.There is, admittedly, one case that seems to be an exception to this rule. Inthe early 1970s, members of the Toronto Society for Psychical Research, underthe direction of A. R. G. Owen, decided to try to manufacture a ghost. For thispurpose, they invented the case history of a man called Philip, a contemporaryof Oliver Cromwell, who had an affair with a beautiful gypsy girl. When Philip’swife found out, she had the girl accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake;Philip committed suicide.Having elaborated this story and created a suitable background—an ancient manorhouse—they set about trying to conjure up the spirit of Philip. For severalmonths, there were no results. Then one evening, as they were relaxing andsinging songs, there was a rap on the table. They used the usual code (one rapfor yes, two for no), to question the “spirit,” which claimed to be Philip, andrepeated the story they had invented for him. At later séances, Philip made thetable dance all around the room, and even made it levitate in front of TVcameras.Owen’s group rightly regarded this “creation” of a ghost as something of atriumph, making the natural assumption that Philip was a product of theirunconscious minds. But this assumption is questionable. What they did, ineffect, was to hold a series of séances until they got results. Philip may havebeen a manifestation of their collective unconscious minds. Or he may have beenanother of those bored and untruthful “spirits” we have already encountered,joining in the game for want of anything better to do. The Philip case cannot beregarded as a proof or disproof of the psychokinesis theory.The trouble is that when scientists start looking for patterns, they areinclined to see what they are expecting to see. If they are good scientists,they finally notice the facts that contradict their theories, and modify thetheories. But this sometimes takes a very long time; sometimes, it never happensat all.On the whole, the scientist is better off if he collects his facts by accident,little by little, so he can study them before he tries to fit them into a jigsawpuzzle. This is how the late Tom Lethbridge came to arrive at his theories aboutother dimensions of reality. It is also how Guy Lyon Playfair came to develophis own theories about the nature of the poltergeist.In 1961, Guy Playfair had been down from Cambridge for two years—he hadgraduated in modern languages—and was finding life in England difficult andrather boring. And when he saw an advertisement in the personal column of TheTimes saying that teachers were wanted for Rio de Janeiro at a thousand pounds ayear, he applied immediately. He signed a two-year contract, and at the end ofthe two years, decided to stay on in Rio as a free-lance journalist. He wasreasonably successful, working as a correspondent for Time and The Economist,then as a writer in the information section of the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment. When President Nixon cut the foreign budget in 1971, Guy Playfairwas offered a golden handshake, and took it; as a result he was able to moveinto a comfortable house with a good view of the harbor.One of his neighbors was an American film actor called Larry Carr, and it wasthrough him that Playfair became involved in the world of Brazilian Spiritism.One day, Carr asked him casually if he would like to go and watch a healer. Justas casually—having nothing better to do—Playfair accepted. They drove out to aSpiritist center in an area full of warehouses and run-down bars—“the kind ofstreet you end up in if you get lost on the way to an airport.” The healer, aman named Edivaldo, was late, having had to drive five hundred miles from hishome town; he was a school-teacher who, with his spectacles and neat mustache,looked more like a bank clerk, or possibly a bank manager. When Playfair’s groupentered the consulting room, Edivaldo would prod the area that was giving thetrouble, write something on a prescription pad, and pass on to the next. WhenPlayfair’s turn came, Edivaldo’s hand went straight to the spot on his stomachwhich had been giving him trouble; pills were prescribed, and Playfair was toldto come back later for “a little operation.” A few months later, he went backfor his operation. When he went into the room, an old man was lying on the bed,and Edivaldo was bending over him. The old man’s stomach had been ripped open,exposing the entrails. Playfair admits that he did not observe as well as hemight because he found it all too bewildering. “He was sloshing around inblood—it was a pretty gruesome sight.” He looked away for a moment, and when helooked back again, the man’s stomach was “all neat and tidy,” and was beingcovered with bandage. The man got up, and was helped out by his wife. One of thehelpers told Playfair to lie down on the bed. He unbuttoned his shirt. Edivaldocame over and ran his hand over his stomach, then his hands seemed to find whatthey were looking for and he pressed. Playfair felt a distinct plop and thehands entered his skin and went into his stomach. “My stomach immediately feltwet all over, as if I were bleeding to death. I could feel a sort of ticklinginside, but no pain at all.” He seemed to smell ether. Then it was all over andhe was told he could get up and go home. He felt curiously stiff as if hismiddle had been anaesthetized, unable to bend. (This so intrigued him that helater tried to reproduce the same effect—with the aid of a friendly doctor whogave him twenty jabs of local anaesthetic; “It wasn’t the same thing at all.”)When he got home, he had to take off his shoes by kicking each one off with theother foot. On his stomach there was a jagged red line where Edivaldo hadpressed his thumbs, and two bright red dots nearby.Later, after a second operation, two more red dots appeared. And Playfair’sstomach complaint, though not permanently cured, was considerably eased.Some time later, Playfair interviewed Edivaldo, and heard the remarkable storyof how he had become a healer. One evening in 1962 he had been called in to sitwith a neighbor who had gone temporarily insane. He became unconscious, andduring this period he smashed up the room. But when he recovered consciousnessthe woman was cured. Soon after that, he visited a woman who had become rigidafter childbirth. He suddenly became rigid himself, and the woman’s rigiditydisappeared. It was clear that he was somehow “taking on” the illness of otherpeople. A psychiatrist told him he was probably a medium, and advised that heshould go to a Spiritist center. The first evening he did this, he again wentinto a trance. When he came to, he was being driven home, and was told that hehad performed several operations. Apparently he was “taken over” by variousspirits who had been surgeons while alive—a Dr. Calazans, a Frenchman calledPierre, a Londoner called Johnson, and a German called Dr. Fritz, who alsoworked through the famous psychic surgeon Arigó.For another year, Playfair continued to spend a great deal of time at Edivaldo’ssurgeries, and watched innumerable operations—on one occasion, Edivaldo (orrather, the “spirit” who was controlling him) took Playfair’s hand and thrust itinto the open stomach. By this time, he was convinced he had discovered thesubject he wanted to write about. He began to attend Spiritist sessions(Spiritism is Brazil’s version of Spiritualism, and is based on the teachings ofKardec). When he encountered Hernani Andrade, founder of the IBPP—BrazilianInstitute for Psycho Biophysical Research—he decided to move from Rio de Janeiroto São Paulo, a move that struck his friends as eccentric, since it is theequivalent of moving from, let us say, the Cornish Riviera to the industrialMidlands, or from Florida to Detroit. But Andrade offered Guy Playfair full andunrestricted access to his files, as well as the insights of forty years ofSpiritism. As a consequence, Playfair’s interest came to extend from psychichealing to poltergeists, reincarnation, black magic and life-after-death.In São Paulo, he began by investigating more psychic surgeons. Then he heard ofa case of poltergeist haunting, and offered to help the IBPP look into it.At the time he heard about it, in 1973, the case had been going on for about sixyears. The family consisted of a Portuguese mother, who had been married to aLithuanian immigrant, and was now divorced. She had a son and daughter, bothadults. There had been the usual bangs and crashes, clothing and bedding hadcaught fire, or had been soaked with water; and as a result of thesedisturbances, the family had already moved house three times. There also seemedto be some evidence of black magic involved; photographs of a girl with threadstitched through it had been found in the house. The troubles had begun afterthe son of the family had married a girl called Nora.It was to their house that Guy Playfair went in October 1973, taking his taperecorder with him. He sat up into the early hours of the morning, reading FrankPodmore—one of the early psychic investigators—on the subject of poltergeists.Podmore came to the conclusion that they are invariably fakes—an example of thekind of stupidity to which members of the SPR occasionally seem to besubject—and at this stage, Playfair thought he might well be correct. Finally,just as he was on the point of dozing off to sleep, he was awakened by a seriesof bangs that shook the house. The poltergeist had arrived. Playfair was struckby the timing—that it began as he was drifting off to sleep; the same thing hadhappened to Suzuko Hashizume, the investigator who had spent the previous nightin the house. Playfair subsequently came to suspect that poltergeists have anuncanny sense of timing which suggest that they are able to foretell the exactmoment when the investigator will be looking the other way.There was something odd about the bangs. They caused nothing to vibrate, as suchbangs normally do, and they seemed to echo longer than they should. Kardec hasnoted in The Medium’s Book:Spirit sounds are usually of a peculiar character; they have an intensity and acharacter of their own, and, notwithstanding their great variety, can hardly bemistaken, so that they are not easily confused with common noises, such as thecreaking of wood, the crackling of a fire, or the ticking of a clock; spiritraps are clear and sharp, sometimes soft and light . . .In fact, a researcher, Dr. J. L. Whitton, subjected a tape-recording of “spiritraps” to laboratory analysis, and found that they are quite different incharacter from normal raps. Shown on a graph, an ordinary sound has adistinctive curve, rising and falling like the slopes of a mountain; spirit rapsbegin and end abruptly, like cliffs. In fact, they seem to be “manufactured”noises, as if the poltergeist had a BBC sound laboratory at its disposal and hadto concoct the noises electronically.The other odd thing about these loud bangs was that they did not disturb thefour dogs, which had barked themselves frantic when Guy Playfair arrived; eitherthey failed to hear them or accepted them as perfectly normal.These bangs were followed by more, at intervals. Later, Playfair tried to makesimilar bangs by thumping the end of a broom handle on the floor; it wasimpossible to make them as loud.The following night, when Playfair was asleep in the downstairs room, afootstool bounced down the stairs, then a bedroom drawer full of clothes washurled out of a window into the yard. A pillow shot out from under Nora’s headand flew across the room. Again and again, Playfair noted the poltergeist’ssense of timing—how things seemed to happen precisely as people were fallingasleep or waking up. Bumps happened mainly at night. Outbreaks of fire couldhappen at any time—on one occasion, a wardrobe full of clothes caught fire, andwould have burned the house down if it had not been caught in time.At this point, the IBPP called in their poltergeist-clearance team of mediums,who went into the house, sat in the kitchen, and asked their spirit guides topersuade the poltergeist to move. After this, there was silence for two weeks;then minor disturbances began again. This time, the family decided to call in acandomblé specialist—candomblé being one of the largest of Brazil’s manyAfrican-influenced cults. This man brought with him a team of helpers. He toldthe family that this struck him as a particularly nasty case of black magic.Rites were performed and incense burned. And at the end of it all, thepoltergeist finally left the family in peace. (At least, it had not reappearedby the time Playfair wrote his book about two years later.)Now the notion of a poltergeist being associated with black magic is one thatEuropean investigators will find bizarre and outlandish. But in Brazil, it istaken for granted. Hernani Andrade is quoted as saying:In every case of person-directed poltergeist activity where I have been able tostudy the family background, there has been evidence that somebody in the housecould be the target of revenge from a spirit. It may be a former lover whocommitted suicide, a jealous relation, a spiteful neighbor, or even a member ofthe same family bearing some trivial grudge. Any Brazilian is well aware thatthis country is full of backyard terreiros of quimbanda (black magic centers)where people use spirit forces for evil purposes.You can use a knife to cut bread or to cut a man’s throat, and so it is with thehidden powers of man; they can be turned to good or bad ends, though they remainthe same powers. To produce a successful poltergeist, all you need is a group ofbad spirits prepared to do your work for you, for a suitable reward, and asusceptible victim who is insufficiently developed spiritually to be able toresist. Black magic is a really serious social problem in Brazil, and we mustfind reliable ways of getting rid of it.Playfair goes on to cite another case in a town near São Paulo, in which thepoltergeist made a number of attempts to burn the baby. One day, the babydisappeared, and the mother heard stifled cries coming from a laundry basket.She rushed to it and found the baby buried inside dirty clothes, in the processof stifling to death. The poltergeist also smashed furniture and wrecked theroof by pounding on it; when the family finally left the house, it looked as ifit had been hit by a bomb. All this is, of course, no proof that poltergeistscan be called up by magic, but it indicates that they can, on occasion, behavewith something like demonic malevolence.In his book The Indefinite Boundary, Playfair devotes a chapter called “The PsiUnderworld” to this problem of magic and malevolence. He cites the disturbingcase of eleven-year-old Maria Jose Ferreira, who, in December 1965, became thecenter of violent poltergeist activity. Pieces of brick began to fall inside thehouse, in Jabuticabal, near São Paulo, and an attempt at exorcism made thingsmuch worse. (Poltergeists, as we have seen, seem contemptuous of attempts toexorcise them.) A neighbor who knew about Kardec took the child into his house;things got worse, with bombardments of stones and eggs. One large stonedescended from the ceiling and split into two; when someone picked up the twopieces, they snapped together as if they were magnetically attracted to eachother. (We have already seen that poltergeists seem to have an affinity withelectricity; it is interesting to speculate whether the force that caused thestones to snap together was an example of “ley power” or what Stringer calls“Telluric force.”)For a while, the poltergeist seemed to be in an amiable mood; Maria could askfor a flower or piece of candy, and it would instantly drop at her feet. Then,quite suddenly, the poltergeist began to attack her, biting her and slapping heron the face or bottom. It tried to suffocate her while she was asleep by placingcups or glasses over her mouth and nostrils. Then it began to set her clothes onfire.When Maria was taken to a Spiritist center, the hope of “curing” herdisappeared. A spirit came and spoke through the medium, saying: “She was awitch. A lot of people suffered, and I died because of her. Now we are makingher suffer too . . .” Spirits, of course, are not invariably truthful, and thisone may have been inventing the tale that Maria had been a witch in a previousexistence. (Kardec, it must be remembered, taught reincarnation as an integralpart of Spiritism.) Special prayers and appeals to the spirits failed to stopthe attacks on the girl. And, when she was thirteen, she took a dose of antkiller in a soft drink and was dead when they found her. It would be interestingto know whether Maria took the poison deliberately, or whether the poltergeistplaced it there, as the “Bell Witch” dosed John Bell’s medicine.All this makes it rather difficult to follow William Roll’s reasoning in thiscentral paragraph from his book on poltergeists:I do not know of any evidence for the existence of the poltergeist as anincorporeal entity other than the disturbances themselves, and these can beexplained more simply as PK effects from a flesh-and-blood entity who is attheir center. This is not to say that we should close our minds to thepossibility that some cases of RSPK might be due to incorporeal entities. Butthere is no reason to postulate such an entity when the incidents occur around aliving person. It is easier to suppose that the central person is himself thesource of the PK energy.The source, possibly. But the whole cause of the phenomena? It is true that insome cases—perhaps the majority—we can interpret the disturbances as anunconscious attempt by the “focus” to draw attention to his or her problems, asan unsuccessful suicide attempt does. Esther Cox’s manifestations ceased aftershe was put in prison. But if Maria’s unconscious aggressions were causing herclothes to catch on fire and bite marks to appear all over her body, surely thedespair that finally drove her to suicide would have reached through to therebellious part of her mind and persuaded it to stop? It simply fails to makesense to believe that Maria’s own unconscious aggressions drove her to killherself.The point is underlined by one of the most remarkable cases described by GuyPlayfair, that of a girl who inadvertently incurred a “black magic curse.” Hecalls her Marcia F. and mentions that she had a master’s degree in psychology.In May 1973, when Marcia was twenty-eight, she went for a family outing to theAtlantic coast near São Paulo. As they walked along the beach, Marcia noticedsomething lying in the sand—a plaster statue of a woman about six inches high,with much of the paint worn off by the sea. She took it back home to herapartment, which she shared with another girl—in spite of her aunt’s warningthat it might bring bad luck to take a statue of the sea goddess Yemanjá, whichhad obviously been placed there as an offering in return for some favor. ButMarcia was a good Catholic as well as a psychology graduate, and thought thatthe talk of bad luck was nonsense. She placed it on her mantelpiece.Some days later she was violently ill with food poisoning after eatingchocolate. Then she began to lose weight and feel rundown. Her vitality wasdraining away. She began to spit blood, and X-rays showed a patch on her lung.Yet a few weeks later the patch had disappeared—it would normally have taken atleast a year. After a holiday at home with her parents, Marcia returned to herflat. The pressure cooker blew up and she suffered second-degree burns on herarms and face. Then the oven exploded, shooting out a sheet of flame towardMarcia; an engineer found the incident unexplainable. A few days later, a friendtold her that at the moment when her pressure cooker had exploded, Marcia’sphotograph had jumped from the wall in her parents’ home.When a friend warned her again about the statue of Yemanjá, Marcia againdismissed the idea as preposterous.Now she began to experience suicidal impulses. Crossing the road at a trafficlight, she suddenly felt a powerful desire to fling herself under the oncomingcars. Opening the window of her apartment (which was on the fifteenth floor) sheseemed to hear a voice inside her urging her to throw herself out.And at this point, the first unmistakable suggestion of witchcraft entered thecase. Her bedroom seemed to be full of presences. Then they entered her bed, andshe felt herself being touched all over. And one night, she felt the presence ofa male body, which moved on top of her; she felt a penis entering her, and laythere while the entity had sexual intercourse. This went on happening forseveral nights, until Marcia, wondering if she was going insane, went again tostay with her parents. There, by chance, they were visited by a Spiritist, towhom Marcia told her story. He advised her to go to the local umbandacenter—umbanda is the most popular Afro-Brazilian cult. She also took along thestatue, at the insistence of her flat mate. The director of the center listenedto her story, and told her that her problem was undoubtedly a case of a blackmagic trabalho (work or job) being directed at her because of her removal of thestatue. It was only then that Marcia looked more closely at the statue which hadonly patches of paint left on it—and realized suddenly that each remaining patchcorresponded to a part of her own body that had been damaged: the burn marks onher arms, neck and face matched exactly the paint on the statue, and the patchon the back was just above the “patch” that had been found in her lung. Thestatue still had paint on its blue eyes, which was ominous. She took the adviceof the director, and returned the statue to the spot on the beach where she hadfound it. Immediately, the run of bad luck ceased.This story bears too many resemblances to Van der Post’s account of the spiritsof the Slippery Hills for us not to feel that the same kind of “earth forces”may have been involved. Van der Post’s guide Samutchoso lamented that thespirits were losing their power—that ten years earlier they would have killedhim for approaching without proper respect. The implication seems to be that thespirits in Brazil are still in possession of their full powers.Playfair personally investigated the case of Marcia, and was not surprised whenshe told him that, as a result of her experience, her skepticism about “badluck” and trabalho had given way to a more pragmatic attitude.Playfair’s observations received strong support from those of anotherinvestigator, his friend David St. Clair, who has described his experiences ofBrazil in a book called Drum and Candle. He speaks of walking down CopacabanaAvenue with some friends on his first night in Rio, and noticing on the pavementa circle of burning candles around a clay statue of the devil. When he reachedout to touch it, one of his friends pulled him back, saying: “It’s despacho—anoffering to a spirit.”“But you surely don’t believe that stuff?” said St. Clair. “You’re all collegegraduates.” His friends admitted that they did not believe in it—butnevertheless would not allow him to touch the statue.After that, St. Clair saw many such offerings. He saw offerings of cookedchicken, and the starving beggars who stared at them, then quietly went away. Heeven saw a dog sniff at such an offering, then back away.St. Clair has many stories about candomblé and Spiritism. But the final chapterof the book describes his own experience of a trabalho. He had been living inRio de Janeiro for eight years, and had a comfortable apartment with a fineview. He also had an attractive maid named Edna, a pretty, brown-colored girl.She was, he assures the reader, a maid and nothing more. Her life had been hard;deserted by the father, her family had been brought up in a shack in a slum. Shewas obviously delighted with the comfort and security of her job with St. Clair.She joined a folk-dance group and, after a television appearance, becamesomething of a local celebrity. And one day, St. Clair told her that he haddecided it was time for him to leave Brazil. Edna was now doing so well that hehad no doubt she would easily find another job; he told her he would give hersix months’ wages.Then things began to go wrong. A book he had written failed to make any headway;his typist made a mess of it, then fell ill so that it sat in her desk forweeks. A New York publisher rejected it. An inheritance he was expecting failedto materialize. His plans for moving to Greece had to be shelved. A love affairwent disastrously wrong, and a friend he asked for a loan refused it. He evenfell ill with malaria.One day, he met a psychic friend in the Avenida Copacabana; she took one look athim and said: “Someone has put the evil eye on you. All your paths have beenclosed.”’ A few days later, another friend wrote to say he had been to anumbanda session, and a spirit had warned him that one of his friends was ingrave danger due to a curse; all his paths had been closed.An actor friend who was also a Spiritist immediately divined that it was Ednawho had put the curse on him. St. Clair thought this absurd. To begin with, Ednawas a Catholic, and had often expressed her disapproval of Spiritism andumbanda. But his actor friend told him he had attended a spiritist session wherehe had been assured that David St. Clair’s apartment was cursed. But how couldEdna do that, St. Clair wanted to know. All she had to do, his friend replied,was to go to a quimbanda—black magic—session and take some item of his clothing,which could be used in a ritual to put a curse on him. And now his friendmentioned it, St. Clair recalled that his socks had been disappearing recently.Edna had claimed the wind was blowing them off the line.St. Clair told Edna he believed himself to be cursed; she pooh-poohed the idea.But he told her he wanted her to take him to an umbanda session. After muchprotest, she allowed herself to be forced into it.That Saturday evening, Edna took him to a long, white house in a remote areaoutside Rio. On the walls were paintings of the devil, Exú. Toward midnight,drums started up, and the negroes sitting on the floor began to chant. A ritualdance began. Then the umbanda priestess came in like a whirlwind—a huge negressdressed in layers of lace and a white silk turban. She danced, and the otherwomen began to jerk as if possessed. The priestess went out, and when she camein again, was dressed in red, the color of Exú/Satan. She took a swig ofalcohol, then lit a cigar. After more dancing, she noticed St. Clair, andoffered him a drink from a bottle whose neck was covered with her saliva. Thenshe spat a mouthful of the alcohol into his face. After more chanting, a mediumwas asked who had put the curse on him. She replied: “The person who brought himhere tonight! She wants you to marry her. Either that, or to buy her a house anda piece of land . . .” The priestess ordered Edna to leave. Then she said: “Nowwe will get rid of the curse.” There was more ritual drumming and dancing, thenthe priestess said: “Now you are free. The curse has been lifted, and it willnow come down doubly hard upon the person who placed it on you.” When heprotested, he was told it was too late—it had already been done.Three days later, St. Clair received a telegram from a magazine, asking for astory; he had suggested it to them months before but they had turned it down.Now, unexpectedly, they changed their minds, and sent him money. A week later,the inheritance came through. The book was accepted. And ten days later hereceived a letter asking if his broken love affair could be restarted where ithad left off. Then Edna became ill. A stomach-growth was diagnosed, and she hadto have an operation for which St. Clair paid. But her health continued todecline. She went to see an umbanda priest, who told her that the curse she hadput onSt. Clair had rebounded on her, and that she would suffer as long as she stayednear him. She admitted trying to get him to marry her by black magic. Shedeclined his offer to buy her a house or an apartment, and walked out of hislife.In The Indefinite Boundary, Playfair goes on to discuss black magic. It seems,he says, to be based on an exchange of favors between incarnate anddiscarnate-man and spirit.Incarnate man wants a favor done; he wants a better job, to marry a certaingirl, to win the state lottery, to stop somebody from running after his daughter. . . Discarnate spirits, for their part, want to enjoy the pleasures of theflesh once more; a good square meal, a drink of the best cachaça rum, a finecigar, and perhaps even sexual relations with an incarnate being.The spirit has the upper hand in all this. He calls the shots. He wants his mealleft in a certain place at a certain time, and the rum and the cigar had betterbe of good quality. Incarnate man is ready to oblige, and it is remarkable howmany members of Brazil’s poorest classes, who are about as poor as anyone canbe, will somehow manage to lay out a magnificent banquet for a spirit who hasagreed to work some magic for them . . .Who are these spirits? Orthodox Kardecists and Umbandistas see them as inferiordiscarnates living in a low astral plane, who are close to the physical world,not having evolved since physical death . . . In Umbanda they are known as exús,spirits who seem to have no morals at all, and are equally prepared to work foror against people. Like Mafia gunmen, they do what the boss says without askingquestions.He adds the interesting comment:The exú reminds us of the traditional spirits of the four elements; the gnomesof earth, the mermaids of water, the sylphs of air, and the salamanders of fire.These creatures are traditionally thought of as part human and part “elemental,”integral forces of nature that can act upon human beings subject to certainconditions. There is an enormous number of exús, each with his own specialty. Tocatch one and persuade him to work for you, it is necessary to bribe himoutright with food, drink and general flattery. An exú is a vain andtemperamental entity, and despite his total lack of morals he is very fussyabout observing the rituals properly.All this sounds so much like the poltergeist that it is tempting to feel that wehave finally pinned down his true nature and character.Studying the background of the Ipiranga case—already described—Playfair foundstrong evidence that the poltergeist had been unleashed on the family by blackmagic. In 1968 an “offering” of bottles, candles, and cigars had appeared intheir garden, indicating that someone was working a trabalho against the family.Playfair lists the suspects. A former boyfriend of Iracy, the daughter, hadcommitted suicide; then there was an elderly aunt who had died abandoned by therest of the family, and may have borne a grudge. Then Iracy had had a loveaffair with a man who was (unknown to her) already married; the man’s wife couldhave organized the trabalho. Or it could possibly have been some formerdisgruntled lover of Nora, the girl who married the son of the family;photographs of Nora’s husband were frequently disfigured, and they found manynotes claiming that she was having an affair with another man.Playfair mentions that at the time he was investigating the Ipiranga case,Andrade was studying one in the town of Osasco where there was definite evidencethat a poltergeist was caused by black magic. Two neighboring families werehaving a lengthy dispute about boundaries, and one of the families ordered acurse against the other. The result was that the other family was haunted by apoltergeist that caused stones to fall on the roof, loud rapping noises, andspontaneous fires. One original feature of this case was that when the familywent to ladle a meal out of a saucepan—which had been covered with a lid—theyfound that the food had been spoiled by a large cigar.Candomblé—one of the bigger Afro-Brazilian cults—seems to have originated amongfreed negro slaves in the 1830s, and it has the same origin as voodoo, whichbegan in Haiti when the first slaves arrived early in the seventeenth century.This, in turn, originated in Africa as ju-ju. Europeans are naturally inclinedto dismiss this as the outcome of ignorance and stupidity; but few who have haddirect experience of it maintain that skeptical attitude. James H. Neal—whoseanecdote about the immovable tree has already been cited—describes his ownexperience in Ju-Ju in My Life. When, as chief investigations officer for theGovernment of Ghana, Neal caused the arrest of a man who had been extortingbribes, he found that he was the target for a ju-ju attack. It began with thedisappearance of small personal items of clothing as in the case of David St.Clair. One day he found the seat of his car scattered with a black powder; hischauffeur carefully brushed it off, and urinated in it to destroy its power.Then, one night, Neal became feverish, and experienced pains from head to foot.He felt he was going to die. Suddenly, he found himself outside his body,looking down at himself on the bed. He passed through the bedroom wall, andseemed to be traveling at great speed, when suddenly he seemed to receive amessage that it was not yet his time to die; he passed back into his room, andinto his body. After this he spent three weeks in a hospital suffering from anillness that the doctors were unable to diagnose. An African police inspectortold him he was being subjected to a ju-ju attack. More black powder wasscattered in his car. One night, lying in bed, he felt invisible creatures withlong snouts attacking his solar plexus and draining his vitality. A witch-doctorwho was called in described in detail two men who were responsible for theattacks—giving an accurate description of two men involved in the bribery case.Finally, after a ceremony performed by a Muslim holy man—who surrounded thehouse with a wall of protection—Neal slowly recovered. The white doctor whotended him agreed that he had been the victim of a ju-ju attack.He also describes how, not long after the “exorcism” ritual, his servant killeda cobra outside his bungalow. As they were exulting about the death of thesnake, Neal noticed another snake—this time a small grey one—slithering towardthem. When he drew the servant’s attention to it, the man went pale. This, theman said, was a “bad snake”—meaning a snake created artificially bywitch-doctors; a man bitten by such a snake has no chance of recovery. Neal wasunderstandably skeptical. Then he saw the snake—which was still slithering at agreat speed toward them—come to a halt as if against an invisible wall. It hadencountered the “wall of protection” put there by the holy man. With a singlestroke, the servant chopped off its head with a cutlass. No blood came out. Soonafter this, Neal began to itch all over. Two perfectly healthy trees just beyondthe “wall of protection” split down the middle with a loud crash. Consultationwith another skilled sorcerer elicited the information that both Neal and hisservant were victims of a new ju-ju attack, but that because of the protection,Neal could not be seriously harmed; the itch was the worst the magician coulddo.This kind of witchcraft can be found in primitive societies all over the world.In a book called Mitsinari, a Catholic priest, Father André Dupreyat, describeshis years in Papua, New Guinea. When he clashed with local sorcerers, he wasalso placed under a “snake curse.” One day, walking toward a village, he wassurprised to see a silvery-colored snake wriggling toward him. The villagers allscattered. Knowing it would have to lower its head to come closer, Dupreyatwaited until it was no longer in a position to strike, and killed it with hisstick. The next day, when he was lying in a hut, a snake lowered itself from theroof-beam and dropped on to his chest. He lay perfectly still until it slid downto the floor, when he was able to kill it with a stick. A few days later, as helay in a hammock, a native warned him that two black snakes had writhed up thesupport of the hammock, and were close enough to bite him. They cautiouslyhanded him a knife and told him when to strike; he succeeded in killing bothsnakes.Dupreyat also has a remarkable account of a local sorcerer named Isidoro who wasable to turn himself into a cassowary (a kind of ostrich). One evening as theyall sat talking of Isidoro, they heard the distinctive sound of a cassowaryrunning, and Isidoro came into the hut. He talked with them for a while, thensaid he would be staying in a house in the village overnight, and went out. Theyagain heard the sound of a cassowary running. Dupreyat checked, and found thatIsidoro was not in the house where he had claimed he would be staying. The nextday, he visited Isidoro’s village—five hours away on the other side of themountain. There he was greeted by Isidoro. Villagers assured him that Isidorohad spent the early part of the previous evening in the communal hut, then goneaway at seven o’clock. By nine o’clock he had been with Dupreyat, a five-hourjourney away on the other side of the mountain. And at dawn, he had beenobserved in his own village again. Yet in the dark, it was at least aneight-hour journey away.James Neal’s own experiences of witchcraft in Ghana ended disastrously. Leavinghis home in a hurry, on a morning when he intended to go to the Accra races—tocapture a race-course gang—he left behind a protecting amulet that had beengiven him by the holy man. From an almost empty grandstand he watched the menbeing arrested by his own officers. Then, walking down from the grandstand, withno one within twenty yards of him, he was pushed violently, and fell. Themultiple fractures he sustained kept him in hospital for months; and when herecovered, his broken bones prevented him from continuing his police work and hewas forced to resign. The holy man, who came to see him in hospital, told himthat he had been pushed by an “astral entity.” Neal insists that, as he waspushed, he twisted round to see who was responsible, and that there was no onethere.On the evening of September 9, 1977, Guy Playfair attended a lecture onpoltergeists at the Society for Psychical Research, and found himself sittingnext to a man named Maurice Grosse. After the lecture, Grosse announced that hewas in the middle of a case, and would be glad of some help. No one volunteered.A few days later, Playfair heard a broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in which MauriceGrosse described some of the amazing things that were happening in the house ofthe Harper family down at Enfield. Reluctantly—because he had just finished abook and was looking forward to a holiday—Playfair decided to offer some help.The Enfield poltergeist had put in its first appearance on the evening of August30, 1977. There were four children in the house: Rose, thirteen, Janet, eleven,Pete, ten and Jimmy, seven; their mother was separated from her husband. Peteand Janet shared a bedroom. That evening, just after Pete and Janet had gone tobed, their beds began to shake in an odd way. They called their mother, but theshaking had stopped. She assumed they were “larking about” and told them to getto sleep. The next evening, the children heard a shuffling noise, like a chairmoving. Mrs. Harper came in and asked them to be quiet. The room all seemed tobe perfectly normal. But when she switched off the light, she also heard theshuffling noise. It sounded like someone shuffling across the room in slippers.Then there were four loud, clear knocks. And when Mrs. Harper put the light onagain, she saw the heavy chest of drawers moving on its own. It slid a distanceof about eighteen inches across the floor. She pushed it back. It slid backagain. She tried to push it back, but it wouldn’t budge—it was as if someone wasstanding on the other side, preventing it from moving. Mrs. Harper began toshake with fear. “All right, downstairs everybody . . .” She went next door andasked the help of their neighbors. Vic Nottingham and his son went back to theHarpers’ house, and searched it from top to bottom. Then the knocking started.Vic Nottingham rushed outside, to see if it was some practical joker on theother side of the wall. There was no one there.They sent for the police. When the lights were switched off, the knockingstarted. Then, in the light from the kitchen, everyone saw a chair that waswobbling into motion. It slid toward the kitchen for three or four feet.The police could do nothing about ghosts, so they left. And the Harper familyslept in the living-room.The next day, all was quiet until evening. Then the poltergeist began throwingthings. Marbles and Lego bricks came zinging through the air as if shot from acatapult. When someone picked up one of the marbles, it was found to be burninghot.Wondering what to do, Mrs. Harper allowed her neighbor to phone the DailyMirror. A reporter and photographer arrived, but saw nothing. They decided to goin the early hours of the morning. As soon as they were outside, the Legobombardment began again. Mrs. Harper rushed out and told them. As thephotographer came in, his camera raised, a Lego brick flew across the room andhit him over the right eye. It caused quite a bruise—one of the few examples ofa poltergeist actually hurting someone. Yet the photograph showed no Lego brickflying towards him—it must have been just beyond the range of the camera. It waslater to occur to Guy Playfair that the poltergeist seemed to go to greattrouble not to be seen doing things.The Daily Mirror contacted the Society for Psychical Research, and the SPRcontacted Maurice Grosse, a recent member who was looking for a case toinvestigate. A few days later, Guy Playfair made his way down to the house inEnfield. It was the beginning of a two-year involvement.Playfair was inclined to suspect Janet, an extremely lively little girl. Heasked Mrs. Harper to keep a special watch on her, adding: “Even if Janet isplaying tricks, it may not be her fault.” For he had come across a curiousdiscovery made by earlier researchers like Nandor Fodor and William Roll: thatthe “focus”’ of a poltergeist case may throw things—in the ordinary way—withoutbeing aware of it. Through a one-way mirror Roll saw one of his “suspects”throwing things; yet a lie detector test showed the suspect was telling thetruth when he denied throwing anything. The implication seems to be that apoltergeist can get inside someone and “make them do things.”While Playfair and a Mirror photographer waited in the dark in Janet’s bedroom,a marble landed with a bang on the floor. The odd thing was it did not roll, asa marble normally would. It stayed put; Playfair tried hard to duplicate this,but found it impossible; unless dropped from very close to the floor, a marblewill roll, particularly on smooth linoleum.When the photographer tried taking a test picture, all three flash-guns on allthree cameras failed to work. When he examined the guns, he found that they hadall been drained of power—although he had charged them a few minutes beforetrying to take the photograph.Playfair tried tying the leg of Janet’s bedside chair to the leg of her bed. Heused wire. Within minutes, the chair had fallen over; the wire had been snapped.He bound it with several twists of wire. Not long after, the chair fell overagain—the wire had snapped. A big armchair tipped over, then the bed shot acrossthe room. A book flew off the shelf, hit the door, proceeded on at right angles,and landed upright on the floor; it was called Fun and Games for Children. Asthey looked at one of the pillows on a bed, an indentation appeared on it, as ifan invisible head was resting there. The head seemed to be a small one, whichled Mrs. Harper to voice her suspicion that this was the ghost of afour-year-old girl who had been suffocated by her father in a nearby house; someof the furniture from the house had found its way into the Harper home, and Mrs.Harper had already thrown it out, suspecting it might be the cause of thetrouble. Clearly, she was mistaken.There came a point when Guy Playfair began to feel that the “entity” wanted tocommunicate—it kept up its knocking on one occasion for two hours and a half. Amedium named Annie Shaw came to the house with her husband George. Annie wentinto a trance, then suddenly screamed, “Go away,” and began to cackle. When herhusband spoke to her, she spat at him. She moaned: “Gozer, Gozer, help me.Elvie, come here.” George spoke firmly to the “entity” that had taken over herbody, advising it to go away and leave the Harper family alone. When Anniereturned to normal, she stated that the haunting centered around Janet, and thatthere were several entities behind it, including an old woman. George added:“This Gozer is a nasty piece of work, a sort of Black Magic chap. The other one,Elvie, is an elemental.” Annie explained that the auric field around Janet andher mother was “leaking,” and that when this happens, poltergeists can use theenergy for their manifestations. The Shaws “cleaned” their auras by a well-knowntechnique—moving their hands from head to foot around the contours of the body,about six inches away. The trouble, said the Shaws, was due to the negativeatmosphere in the house—and Mrs. Harper admitted that she did feel bitter abouther ex-husband, and had been keeping the feeling bottled up for years. One wayof preventing a poltergeist from manifesting itself, said Annie Shaw, was tolearn to control one’s energies, so they stop “leaking.”For a few weeks after this healing session, the manifestations almost ceased.Then, in late October, they started up again—furniture flung around, bedsshaking, blankets ripped off beds—Playfair and Grosse recorded about fourhundred incidents in a brief space. Pools of water also began to appear on thekitchen floor—pools with very distinct outlines, as if made by pouring waterfrom a jug immediately onto the linoleum. One puddle was shaped like a humanfigure.The entity began doing things that could have caused serious damage. Oneevening, an iron grille from the bottom of a fireplace sailed across the roomand landed on Jimmy’s pillow—a little closer, and it could have killed him. Thenext evening, the heavy gas fire was ripped out of the wall—it had been cementedinto the brickwork. (Poltergeists can display frightening strength; in TheFlying Cow, Playfair records a poltergeist that lifted a Jeep forty yardsthrough the air.)On the advice of the veteran researcher E. J. Dingwall, Playfair triedcommunicating with the “entity.” When it rapped, he rapped back. When he askedit to use the usual code—one rap for yes, two for no—there followed a volley ofloud raps. Playfair asked: “Don’t you realize you are dead?” which seemed toinfuriate it. Crashes came from a bedroom, and when they rushed up, the room wasin chaos, with objects scattered all over. Evidently “Gozer” was not anxious tomake polite conversation.Maurice Grosse was more successful a few weeks later. “Did you die in thishouse?” The rap-code indicated “Yes.” “Will you go away?” A loud thud said “No.”The entity indicated that it had lived in the house for a long time—more thanthirty years. It had left fifty-three years ago. When the raps seemed to becomenonsensical, Grosse asked: “Are you having a game with me?” A cardboard boxcontaining cushions flew across the room and struck Grosse on the forehead. GuyPlayfair, who was outside the door with his tape recorder (the poltergeist hadtaken a dislike to him), recorded all this on tape; the box made an odd,swishing noise. Yet no one actually saw the box flying across the room. It wasas if it had vanished from its old position, and rematerialized as it struckMaurice Grosse on the head.Like most poltergeists, this one was getting into its stride as it became moreskilled. The children began to see shadowy figures, and seven-year-old Jimmy wasterrified when he looked toward the wall, and saw a disembodied face—an oldman’s face with big white teeth—staring at him. In front of Grosse and severalother witnesses, it threw Janet off her chair, across the room, a distance ofeight feet. As Rose, the eldest girl, went upstairs, the ghost literally pulledher leg—the investigators found her standing on one leg, the other stretched outbehind her, unable to move. She was only able to walk when Grosse twisted hersideways.They decided to ask the ghost to write out a message, and left a pencil andpaper. A few minutes later, they found that someone had written: “I will stay inthis house. Do not show this to anyone else or I will retaliate.” Anothermessage read: “Can I have a tea bag.” Mrs. Harper placed one on the table and, afew moments later, a second tea bag appeared beside it.When Mrs. Harper’s husband came to call to pay his maintenance money, heexpressed disbelief in all this, and Mrs. Harper showed him themessage—forgetting that it had ordered her not to. She said out loud: “I’msorry, I forgot.” Another piece of paper appeared on the table: “Amisunderstanding. Don’t do it again.”A few days after this, the Society for Psychical Research sent a team ofinvestigators to look at the place. They had evidently decided that thepoltergeist activity was all due to the girls. Balloons full of water wereplaced under the beds for some reason; and, when they burst, water drippedthrough the ceiling. When the team had left, Grosse and Playfair—who had beenpresent—had some irritable things to say about the SPR’s obsession with fraud.By now it was very clear that Janet was the poltergeist’s main target. She wasoften thrown out of bed seven or eight times before she succeeded in getting tosleep. When she fell asleep, she twitched and moaned; Playfair began to feelincreasingly that she was “possessed.” He recalled the case of Maria Ferreira,the South American girl who had been driven to suicide by a poltergeist, andfelt some misgiving. On one occasion, with a photographer in the bedroom, Janetwas hurled out of bed—the event was photographed—and then, as the photographerand Maurice Grosse tried to hold her, she went into convulsions, screamedhysterically, and bit Grosse. When finally put back into bed, she fell asleep.Later, there was a crash, and they found her lying on top of the radio set,still fast asleep.The following night, Janet had more convulsions, and wandered around, talkingaloud. “Where’s Gober. He’ll kill you.”Two of Playfair’s friends from Brazil, who happened to be in London, called atthe Enfield house, and succeeded in bringing Janet out of one of her trance-likestates. Their view was that Janet was a powerful medium and ought to be trainedto use her powers. One of the two Brazilian mediums wrote on a sheet of paper:“I see this child, Janet, in the Middle Ages, a cruel and wanton woman whocaused suffering to families of yeomen—some of these seem to have now to geteven with the family.” Soon after this, Janet began producing drawings, in astate of semi-trance; one of them showed a woman with blood pouring out of herthroat, with the name “Watson” written underneath. Other drawings continued thistheme of blood, knives and death. When Playfair asked Mrs. Harper if she knew ofa Watson, she replied that it was the name of the previous tenants of the house.Mrs. Watson had died of a tumor of the throat.Playfair asked Janet if she could bend a spoon like Uri Geller. He glanced awayfor a moment, as Mrs. Harper spoke to him; when he looked back, the spoon wasbent in the middle—it was lying in the center of the table. Janet said she hadexperienced a sudden feeling of headache as the spoon bent.In December 1977, the poltergeist began making noises—whistling and barkingsounds. Maurice Grosse decided to try asking it to speak. “Call out my name,Maurice Grosse.” He went out of the room, and a strange voice said: “Maurice . .. O . . .” Grosse asked it to say its own name. “Joe Watson.” When Guy Playfairasked: “Do you know you are dead?” the voice said angrily: “Shut up!” And tofurther requests that it go away, it replied: “Fuck off.” Joe seemed to beincapable of polite conversation. When another researcher, Anita Gregory, askedit questions she was told to bugger off.The investigators wondered whether Janet could be simulating this voice,although it seemed unlikely; it was a masculine growl, and had an odd quality,as if electronically produced. (I have one of Guy Playfair’s tape recordings ofthe voice, and it reminds me strongly of a record I have of an electronic brainsinging “Daisy, Daisy.”) The voice would not speak if the investigators were inthe room. But their attempts were rewarded with long sentences. The voice nowidentified itself as Bill, and said it had a dog called Gober the Ghost. Askedwhy it kept shaking Janet’s bed it replied: “I was sleeping here.” “Then why doyou keep on shaking it?” “Get Janet out.” Rose asked: “Why do you use badlanguage?” “Fuck off you,” replied Bill. And when Janet asked why it playedgames with them it replied: “I like annoying you.” “Where do you come from?”“From the graveyard.” It even named the graveyard—Durant’s Park, which is in thearea.At Guy Playfair’s suggestion, Rose asked why it didn’t go away. “I don’t believein that.” “Why? What’s so different about being up there?” asked Rose, andreceived the wistful reply: “I’m not a heaven man.” It went on to say in a jerkymanner: “I am Bill Haylock and I come from Durant’s Park and I am seventy-twoyears old and I have come here to see my family but they are not here now.”On the tape, the words come out one by one, as if the speaker is so breathlessthat he can only get out one at a time. (The voice is so obviously that of anold man that the notion of Janet producing it by ventriloquism is absurd.)Rose’s next question is interrupted by a furious outburst: “You fucking oldbitch, shut up. I want some jazz music. Now go and get me some, else I’ll gobarmy.”Maurice Grosse’s son Richard paid a visit to the house and succeeded in holdinga lengthy conversation with the voice. When he asked it what it had done withthirty pence that had vanished it said it had hidden the money in theradio—which is where it was found. Asked how he had died, “Bill” replied that hewent blind and had a hemorrhage—he fell asleep and died in a chair downstairs.Richard Grosse found that if he looked at Janet’s face while the voice wasspeaking, it would stop. If he thought of looking around, the voice would alsostop, as if reading his mind.Another researcher named David Robertson had no difficulty getting the voice totalk, although the main thing it wanted to discuss was girls’ periods. Then theghost was asked to levitate Janet, and then draw a line round the light on theceiling. Robertson withdrew outside, and heard Janet being bounced up and downon the bed. Suddenly there was a gasp and silence. He tried to open the door andfound that it was jammed tight. When it opened again, Janet was on the bed andthere was a red line around the light. Janet claimed that she had floatedthrough the wall, into the bedroom of the next house—belonging to PeggyNottingham (who was with David Robertson at the time). She described it as “allwhite”—a fairly accurate description of the light wallpaper. Peggy asked her totry doing it again, and went next door to see what happened. Janet was notthere. But on the floor, there was the book Fun and Games for Children, whichhad been on the mantelpiece in Janet’s bedroom a few minutes earlier.Robertson handed a red plastic cushion to Janet and said: “See what you can dowith that.” “All right, David boy,” said the invisible entity—which seemed tolike Robertson—“I’ll make it disappear.” Robertson went out of the room, andthere was a cry from Janet. When he went back, the cushion had vanished; thewindow was tightly shut. But a neighbor who was passing the house at that momentsuddenly saw a red cushion appear on the roof. Another neighbor later testifiedthat she had also seen the cushion as she walked past. And looking at Janet’sbedroom window, she had seen books and cushions striking the window, and Janetrising into the air—in a horizontal position—and descending again, as if beingbounced on a trampoline. “She was definitely lying horizontal, coming up anddown.” Guy Playfair tried bouncing on Janet’s bed, and found that no matter howhard he bounced, it was impossible to get up into the air.Playfair was struck by Janet’s comment that when she had floated through thewall into Peggy’s bedroom, it was “all white” and there were no colors. Hearrived at the conclusion that what had happened was that Janet had had an “outof the body” experience—other astral travelers have observed the lack of colorduring “OOBs.” But this fails to explain how the book also passed through thewall.Was there, Playfair asked himself at this point, any more the poltergeist coulddo to demonstrate its versatility? In fact, it went on to produce a wholevariety of new phenomena. It became rather more violent with Janet, making anattempt to suffocate her with the curtains, and making a knife follow her aroundin the air. (The voice claimed that this was the doing of another entity calledTommy.) It produced a biscuit out of nowhere and stuck it into Janet’s mouth. Itput butter and cheese on a piece of bread. (When Guy Playfair tried to touch itthe voice rasped, “Leave it alone.” ) It smeared ordure around the place. Itbegan causing fires in closed drawers—fires which, fortunately, extinguishedthemselves. It produced some appalling stinks, like rotten cabbages. After avisit from the psychic Matthew Manning, it began scrawling obscene messages onthe kitchen walls. When the two pet goldfish died, the “voice” claimed it hadelectrocuted them by accident (which, if true, seems to confirm thatpoltergeists use some form of electrical energy).A medium called Gerry Sherrick told the Harpers that they had all been togetherin a previous existence and that the girls had dabbled in witchcraft. He alsotold them he felt that a nasty old woman was connected with the “haunting” andthat she had lived near Spitalfields market. Had there been any smells likerotten vegetables? After this, he went into a trance and an old woman’s voiceannounced: “I come here when I like . . . I’m not bleedin’ dead and I’m notgoing to go away.” Sherrick performed “psychic healing” on the family—to healthe “leaks” that were causing the trouble. After his visit, the Enfield housebecame quiet for several weeks, as it had after the two previous visits bymediums.The case was beginning to create something more like a normal haunting. Mrs.Harper saw an apparition of a pair of legs in blue trousers going upstairs andalso saw a child. The children continued to see old men. A neighbor who waslooking after the house when the Harpers went to the seaside saw a man in hisshirtsleeves sitting at the table. Another neighbor knocked on the front door,and through the window saw Maurice Grosse in the hall, then watched him goupstairs. When finally admitted, she discovered that Maurice Grosse had been inthe upper part of the house for the past half hour or so. The poltergeist was“imitating” him.In mid-1978, Janet went into the Maudsley Hospital for observation and testing.Playfair expected the disturbances in Enfield to cease while she was away; infact they continued, although on a smaller scale. And Janet claimed that anumber of small poltergeist incidents happened to her while in hospital. ButJanet’s spell in the Maudsley—which made her healthier and stronger—was thebeginning of the end of the Enfield case.The haunting seems to have been brought to an end by a Dutch clairvoyant namedDono Gmelig-Meyling, who was brought to the house by a Dutch journalist whowanted to study the case. The day before their first visit had beeneventful—overturned furniture, knocks, footsteps, sounds of breathing andexcrement smeared on the floor. Dono spent some time in the house, then returnedto his hotel. There, he later told Playfair, he went on an “astral trip,” andmet a twenty-four-year-old girl who was somehow involved with the case. This wasan interesting new departure. Later, Dono met Maurice Grosse, and again had astrong sense that he was somehow connected with the haunting—and not purely asan investigator. When Grosse mentioned that his own daughter had been killed ina motorcycle accident two years before—she would have been twenty-four if stillalive—Dono said: “Well that’s it. It’s your daughter . . .” There was nosuggestion that she was responsible for any of the poltergeist activity, onlythat she was somehow connected. In the final chapter of his account of theEnfield case, This House Is Haunted, Playfair tries to draw together hisspeculations about the disturbances. His suggestion is that Maurice Grosse’sdaughter—whose name was also Janet—was involved indirectly. It was she who haddrawn her father’s attention to the case. Janet had died after a motorcyclecrash in 1976—and Grosse had been impressed by a series of odd events andcoincidences. A birthday card she had sent to her brother just before theaccident showed someonewith her head swathed in bandages, and an inscription about falling on it. Janethad died of head injuries. Grosse found himself wondering if Janet was somehowstill alive, and thought that a suitable sign would be some rain—there had beena drought for months. The next morning, the kitchen roof below Janet’s bedroomwindow was wet, although everywhere else was dry. It had been because of Janet’sdeath that Grosse had thought about engaging in active psychical research, andhis first case had been the Enfield haunting.Playfair speculates that it was Janet who had somehow put it into the neighbor’shead to ring the Daily Mirror, and who put it into the journalist’s head to ringthe SPR. So her father became involved in investigating a case that centeredaround another Janet. (Kardec claims that spirits often influence our thoughts.)As to how the poltergeist haunting came about in the first place, Playfair’sspeculation is as follows:When Mr. and Mrs. Harper were divorced, an atmosphere of tension built up amongthe children and their mother, just at the time when the two girls wereapproaching physical maturity. They were a very energetic pair to start with,both of them school sports champions, but even they could not use up thetremendous energy they were generating. So a number of entities came in andhelped themselves to it.As to the identity of the “entities”: “it looks as if we had half the localgraveyard at one time or another.” These included Joe Watson, husband of thewoman who had died of a cancer of the throat and Bill Haylock, later identifiedas a former local resident. There could well have been a dozen entitiesaltogether, and they were able to take energy from practically everyone in thehouse. (Mrs. Harper experienced premonitory headaches before things happened,and while Janet was in hospital, the youngest boy, Jimmy, began having trances.)The Dutch clairvoyant Dono Gmelig-Meyling stated confidently that he would beable to put an end to the haunting (by some kind of intervention “on the astralplane”), and it is a fact that his visits marked the end of the Enfield case.And why did so many entities invade the Harper residence? The answer, Playfairbelieves, may be provided by Kardec, who states that many dead people are quiteunaware that they are dead. In The Flying Cow he cites the interestingRuytemberg Rocha case in support of this view. In November 1961, a spiritistgroup in São Paulo found themselves listening to a voice—coming through themedium—which identified itself as Ruytemberg Rocha, a pupil in the second yearof the Officers’ School of the São Paulo State Police. The voice gave details ofits family and date of birth, and added that it was wounded by shrapnel in therevolution in 1932. When Dr. Carvalho—in charge of the session—said that thiswas now 1961 the spirit was astonished, and said that that was impossible.Carvalho assured him that he was dead, and that they would do all they could tohelp him.It was an excellent case for verification, since the spirit had given so manydetails about himself and his family. A little research revealed that it allchecked out—the family, the officer school, the battle in which he had died. Oneminor discrepancy was that Rocha had been killed by a bullet through the head,while the spirit spoke only about a shrapnel wound in the chest. But a bullet inthe brain could have stimulated the chest area, giving him the impression thatthis is where he was wounded. According to Kardec, the state of confusionhappens mostly in cases of sudden death, and may last for anything from hours toyears. In the Enfield case, we have seen how angry the “entity” became whenPlayfair declared that it was dead, and how the quarrelsome old woman asserted“I’m not bleedin’ dead.”Yet, as usual in poltergeist cases, it is practically impossible to get at thetruth. The spirits themselves seldom seem to have any interest in the truth. Inthe present case, there are intriguing hints about a man called Gozer or Goberwho practiced black magic, and about the involvement of Janet and Rose inwitchcraft in a previous existence. There was a former resident in the housecalled Joe Watson, who did die in the house much as described by Janet’s bassvoice and whose wife did die of throat cancer, and there was a former neighborcalled Bill Haylock. All of which adds at least a semblance of logic and reasonto one of the best-authenticated poltergeist cases on record.Perhaps the last word should go to a medium—and police commissioner—called Dr.Rafael Ranieri, quoted by Playfair in The Flying Cow:A medium is an open door to the invisible world. What comes through that doordepends to a large extent upon the personality of the medium, and it is quitewrong to suppose that the spirit world consists entirely of angelic beingsdevoted to our welfare. There are plenty of evil spirits around, also others whoseem to have nothing better to do than fool about and amuse themselves at ourexpense by such elementary . . . parlor tricks as lifting up tables and throwingthings around the room. This would seem to be the level of spirit most often tobe found at some of the widely publicized séances, and those who find spiritcommunications trivial, as many are, should blame the mediums, not the spirits.If Janet and other members of the Harper family are unconscious mediums, perhapsit is hardly surprising that the entities who make use of their energies shouldbelong to a fairly low level of the spirit hierarchy."},{"pageContent":"seven [../Text/Contents.xhtml#seven-anchor]Ghost Huntersand Ghost SeersIf the history of ghost-hunting has to have a starting point, then the year 1829is probably as good as any. It saw the publication of a book called The Seeressof Prevorst, which became one of the bestsellers of the nineteenth century, andfamiliarized the general public with the idea that we may be surrounded byinvisible spirits. It was written by Dr. Justinus A. C. Kerner, a rich andeccentric doctor who was also a well-known poet and songwriter. In 1826, theforty-year-old Kerner was practicing in Weinsberg, near Heilbronn, when he wasconsulted by the relatives of a woman called Friederike Hauffe, who was dying ofa wasting disease. She had lost all her teeth and looked like a walkingskeleton.It seemed that marriage was responsible for her sad condition. Ever sincechildhood she had fallen into trances, seen visions, and conversed withinvisible spirits. She could also accurately predict the future. When she wasnineteen, she had married a cousin, and gone into depression; at twenty, herfirst child was born, and she began to develop hysterical symptoms. Everyevening, she fell into a trance in which she saw spirits of the dead.Kerner was at first inclined to be skeptical about her visions and spirits—heput them down to hysteria. Yet he found Friederike Hauffe a fascinating case forstudy. She claimed to be able to see into the human body, and certainly had aremarkably precise knowledge of the nervous system. She could read with herstomach—Kerner tested her by making her lie down with her eyes closed, and laiddocuments on her bare midriff; she read them perfectly. She could makegeometrical drawings at great speed, even in the dark, and could draw perfectcircles that looked as if they had been drawn by compasses. She claimed that herspirit often left her body and hovered above it.Kerner tried ordinary medicines on her, but they had no effect. Friederike toldhim that if he placed her in a “magnetic trance” the spirits would instruct himon how to treat her, but he was reluctant to accept this advice. Eventually, hedecided that he might as well try the effectsof mesmerism.This, it should be explained, is not another name for hypnotism. Franz AntonMesmer believed that the human body is permeated with a vital fluid, which needsto move around freely if we are to remain healthy. If this fluid becomes“blocked,” the result is illness. (Modern acupuncture holds roughly the samebelief.) According to Mesmer, this vital fluid could be moved around the body bystroking it with magnets—a technique that sometimes produced the “magnetictrance.” (It was his pupil, the Marquis de Puysegur, who accidentally discoveredthe parallel technique of hypnosis.)Friederike reacted well to “magnetism,” passing easily into a trance. But Kernerremained skeptical about the things she said in this condition. Then, one day, aremarkable experience changed his mind. Friederike declared that she was beinghaunted by an unpleasant man with a squint. From her description, Kernerrecognized him as a man who had died a few years earlier. It seemed, accordingto Friederike, that the man was suffering from a guilty conscience. He had beeninvolved in embezzlement and, after his death, another man had been blamed. Nowhe wanted to clear the man’s name, for the sake of his widow. This could be doneby means of a certain document, which would be found in a chest. The spirit“showed” Friederike the room where the document was to be found, and a man whowas working there. Her description was so good that Kerner was able to identifyhim as a certain Judge Heyd. In her “vision,” Friederike had seen Judge Heydsitting in a certain place in this room, and the chest containing the documenton the table. The document was apparently not in its proper numerical order,which is why it had not been found.When Kerner told him about his patient’s vision, Judge Heyd was astounded; hehad been sitting in the position described on that particular day (ChristmasDay), and the chest, contrary to regulations, had been left open on the table.When they searched, the document turned up where Friederike had said it would.The widow of the man who had been wrongly accused was able to obtain redress.From now on, Kerner believed in Friederike’s supernatural powers, and tookwhatever she said seriously. She told him that we are surrounded by spirits allthe time, and that she was able to see them. These spirits often try to attractour attention in various ways: knocking, movement of objects, throwing of sand.And by way of convincing him, Friederike persuaded one of the spirits to makerapping noises, to make gravel and ash fall from the air, and to make a stoolfloat up into the air. Kerner watched with amazement as the stool rose gently,then floated down again.Friederike provided him with further proof of the accuracy of her visions whenshe succeeded in putting an end to a haunting. Kerner heard about a house wherethe ghost of an old man was frightening the inhabitants. He brought one of them,a woman, along to see Friederike; the seeress went into a trance and explainedthat the ghost was that of a man called Bellon, who was an “earth-bound spirit”as a result of defrauding two orphans. Kerner made inquiries, but no one hadever heard of a man called Bellon. But since the ghost claimed that he had beenBurgomeister, it seemed probable that some record existed. He claimed he hadbeen Burgomeister in the year 1700, and had died at the age of seventy-nine.Armed with this information, Kerner asked the present mayor to check the legaldocuments; they soon found that in the year 1700, a man called Bellon had beenBurgomeister and director of the local orphanage. He had died in 1740 at the ageof seventy-nine. After “confessing,” the spirit took its departure.While Friederike was in Kerner’s house, there were constant poltergeistphenomena: knocks and raps, noises like the rattling of chains, gravel thrownthrough the window, and a knitting needle that flew through the air and landedin a glass of water. When Friederike was visited by a spirit one night hersister heard her say: “Open it yourself,” then saw a book on the table openitself. A poltergeist tugged her boots off her feet as she lay on the bed, andthrew a lampshade across the room. In the Kerners’ bedroom, a table was thrownacross the room. The poltergeist threw a stool at a maidservant who went intoFriederike’s room while she lay asleep. It extinguished a night light and made acandle glow.Friederike also produced what would later be called “spirit teachings,” anamazingly complex system of philosophy in which man is described as consistingof body, soul and spirit, and of being surrounded by a nerve aura which carrieson the vital processes. She spoke about various cycles in human existence—lifecycles (or circles) and sun circles, corresponding to various spiritualconditions. She also described a remarkable universal language from ancienttimes, said to be “the language of the inner life.” (A mystical sect was foundedto expound those doctrines after her death.)All these mediumistic activities made Friederike more and more feeble, and shedied in 1829 at the age of twenty-eight. Kerner’s book The Seeress of Prevorst(the name of the Swabian village where she was born) created a sensation, andwas equally successful when it was translated into English in 1845 by CatherineCrowe, whose own book, The Night Side of Nature, created an equal sensation fouryears later. It is arguable that The Seeress of Prevorst and The Night Side ofNature were two of the most influential books of the nineteenth century.In the second half of the nineteenth century, as the scientific reaction againstSpiritualism increased, The Seeress of Prevorst ceased to be taken seriously bythose engaged in psychical research, and by the twentieth century it had beenvirtually forgotten. Writing about it in his Modern Spiritualism (1902), theskeptical Frank Podmore—who believed that all poltergeists are due to naughtychildren—dismisses most of the evidence as second-hand, while another eminentresearcher, E. J. Dingwall (writing in Abnormal Hypnotic Phenomena) seems tofeel that Kerner was stupid to take her claims seriously, and that if he hadremained skeptical and treated her simply as a case of hysteria, she would havelived longer. But reading Kerner’s own account, it is difficult to see how hewould have remained skeptical without being downright dishonest or blind; on oneoccasion, he saw a cloudy figure hovering in front of her, and although it hadvanished when he came back with a lamp, Friederike continued to stare at thespot as though listening to it.In fact, we can see that the case of the seeress of Prevorst is a thoroughlytypical case of poltergeist phenomena caused by a medium. In detail afterdetail, it sounds like any number of other cases of “haunting.” If anyone killedFriederike Hauffe, it was the spirits themselves, who must have been using herenergy to manifest themselves. No doubt the poltergeist phenomena wereunspectacular because Friederike was weak from the moment Kerner set eyes onher. (In a case cited by the novelist William de Morgan, a maidservant who wasable to cause rapping noises gradually lost her powers as she became weaker fromtuberculosis.)In another of his books, Kerner describes another remarkable case with some ofthe characteristics of poltergeist haunting. He was asked to treat a “possessed”peasant girl in Orlach, near Stuttgart. For some reason which is not clear, shewas persecuted by “spirits” from the age of twenty, and there were the usualbangs and crashes, movements of furniture, and even outbreaks of fire. Then,after five months of this, she saw two ghosts, one of a nun dressed in white,the other of a monk dressed in black. The nun asserted that she had beensmuggled into the monastery disguised as a cook, and had had two children by theblack monk, both of whom he had killed at birth. He also murdered three monksduring the four-year period she was with him; and, when he suspected she wasabout to betray him, he killed her too. The black monk also spoke to thepossessed girl, saying that he was the son of a nobleman from nearby Geislingen,and that as the Superior at the monastery of Orlach, he had seduced a number ofnuns and killed the children they bore. He also confessed to killing monks. Thebodies, he said, he threw into a hole in a wall.The white nun told the girl that her sufferings would cease only if her parentsagreed to allow their cottage to be demolished. By this time they were sodesperate that they agreed. On March 5, 1833, the house was finally demolished.Most of the walls were made of mud, but one corner was constructed of limestone,obviously part of a far older building. When this was pulled down, they foundunderneath it an empty well containing a number of human bones, including thoseof children. The girl’s possession ceased from the moment the wall collapsed.The story sounds like a typical invention of a German romantic novelist; butKerner devotes a whole book to it, describing it in the same detail as hisinvestigation of Friederike Hauffe. In spite of this, modern investigators areinclined not to take it seriously. Yet readers who are impressed by the clarityand detail of Kerner’s reporting may feel that this case of the possessed girlof Orlach is one of the most convincing arguments for the close connectionbetween poltergeists and spirits of the dead.Ten years after publication of The Seeress of Prevorst, another doctor—this timeof philosophy—produced an equally remarkable account of a case of possession,this time benevolent. In Die Schutzgeister (The Guardian Spirit, 1839), HeinrichWerner identifies his eighteen-year-old subject only as “R.O.” Like Friederike,she had been subject to all kinds of illnesses; then, at a certain point, foundherself haunted by spirits. One day the girl fell into a trance; and from thenon she was able to do so at will, and to supply Werner with all kinds ofinformation obtained “clairvoyantly.” She had a guardian spirit called Albert,who seems to have acted rather like the “spirit guide”’ of later mediums. Andthe spirit who caused her so much trouble was—again—a wicked monk. One day whenthe girl claimed that the wicked monk was present in the room, Werner waspuzzled to hear an odd sound coming from a small table—like a cup rattling on asaucer. This occurred a number of times, becoming steadily louder (a typicalcharacteristic of poltergeist noises); R.O. said that the monk was producing thenoise, and was delighted at Werner’s astonishment—which also sounds typical of apoltergeist.One day, Werner was startled to hear a loud crash from an empty room; he rushedin to find that two large flowerpots, which had stood on the window sill, hadbeen hurled to the floor so violently that there was earth all over the room.The blind was closed and there was no breeze. One of the curtains had also beentwisted around a birdcage. Later that day, Werner went to call on R.O., who wentinto a trance, and then told Werner that the black monk had been responsible forsmashing the flowerpots (Werner had not mentioned this to her). Albertapparently had ejected him from the house.Werner was greatly impressed by his patient’s clairvoyant powers. Shedemonstrated these one day when she woke up from a trance and told him that shehad seen herself driving in a green-lacquered chaise. Now Werner had, at thetime, made some enquiries about a chaise that was for sale in a town somefifteen hours away, and he expected to get an answer in about a week. R.O. toldhim he would hear much sooner than that—in fact, the following afternoon; shealso went on to describe the chaise, in some detail. The following afternoon,Werner received a message about the chaise, and discovered that the girl wasright in every detail.Her most dramatic piece of clairvoyance concerned her younger sister. One day,in a trance, she cried out “Albert, help me! Emilie is falling down into thestreet.” Then, after a short period, she said: “Thank God, help has alreadycome!”Asked what had happened, she explained that her little sister had been leaningout of a top-story window, trying to grab a rope suspended from a winch abovethe window; she had been on the point of falling when her father had entered theroom and pulled her back.Werner contacted the father to ask if anything remarkable had happened on thatparticular day, and received a reply which Werner printed in his book; it saidthat the father had been sitting in his office when he had felt uneasy. He wenthome, and went upstairs, in time to find his daughter had leaned too far out ofthe window to catch the rope, and could not get back into the room; he grabbedher dress and hauled her back in. R.O. said that it was Albert, the guardianspirit, who had made her father feel uneasy.Again, writers like Podmore and Dingwall express strong skepticism aboutWerner’s book—Dingwall says that when the flowerpots were smashed, Werner shouldhave checked on the key (or keys) to the room and whether anyone could have gotin past the Venetian blind. In a case like this, such pedantic hair-splitting isirrelevant. After all, Werner might have invented the whole case. In a book likethis: the basic question is of Werner’s honesty, and whether he reported thecase to the best of his ability. If he did, then the real question is notwhether he could have spent more time double-checking on everything thathappened, but whether we can accept his own interpretation of the things hewitnessed. As “tough-minded” psychical researchers, Podmore and Dingwallnaturally reject the whole notion of a guardian spirit, as well as of malevolentdead monks; therefore, they are inclined to question the whole story. In fact,there is nothing in Werner’s account that is inconsistent with the behavior ofpoltergeists as explored and described in this book, and a great deal that fitsvery convincingly And whether we interpret Albert as a spirit guide, or simplyas a higher level of R.O.’s personality, he also seems to deserve rather moreserious treatment than Podmore seems willing to grant.The cases described by Justinus Kerner and Heinrich Werner excited widespreadinterest in Europe, and led to much serious discussion. A similar case thatoccurred in America in 1844 received almost no publicity, and led to apersecution of the two principals that seemed to prove that the spirit of theSalem witchcraft trials was still alive. The case is documented in EmmaHardinge’s Modern American Spiritualism (1870).Dr. Lyman B. Larkin was a physician of Wrentham, Mass., whose servant girl, MaryJane, suffered from fits. Larkin was another practitioner of “magnetism,” and hebegan trying to cure Mary Jane by this method—probably stroking her with largebar magnets. Mary Jane was soon falling into hypnotic sleep, during which shebecame clairvoyant. (The same thing was to happen to another American in the1890s; Edgar Cayce was put to sleep by a hypnotist in an attempt to cure theloss of his voice; he was not only able to prescribe for his own ailment, butfor other people’s. Cayce went on to become one of the most famous “psychics” ofhis time.) Mary Jane could instantly diagnose the illnesses of any of thedoctor’s patients, and often suggest the correct prescription.Mary Jane told Larkin that when she went into her trance states, she saw abeautiful “fairy” called Katy, and it was she who performed the diagnoses. Therewere also other “fairies,” who all came from Germany.At this point, Mary Jane began to attract less benevolent entities. There wereloud rapping noises from various articles of furniture as soon as she fell intotrance. Mary Jane began to speak in a strange voice, uttering awful obscenities.Then the furniture began to move about. One day, as the whole family sat in theroom, with Mary Jane asleep on the couch, a flat iron suddenly appeared in theroom—it had last been seen in the kitchen. When Mrs. Larkin requested the spiritto take it away, the iron vanished, and was later found in the kitchen. (It is apity that Larkin failed to record whether anyone was looking at it at the time;as we have seen, poltergeists seem to prefer to perform their tricks when no oneis watching.) The mischievous spirit, according to Mary Jane, was the ghost of asailor boy.It seems probable that Larkin was himself an unconscious medium, for some of themanifestations followed him on his rounds; in one house, loud knockingsterrified the family, who were convinced they were a premonitory warning ofdisaster.Like Werner’s patient R.O., Mary Jane was able to describe to the doctor exactlywhat he had been doing during the day—an ability known to researchers astravelling clairvoyance. On one occasion, she even told him about someirritations he had suffered at supper on the previous evening, due to the salmonbeing underdone, and the roast pig eaten up before the doctor had helpedhimself.The sailor boy now became more violent, and began to cause powerful convulsionsof Mary Jane’s body, in the course of which her joints were dislocated. Althoughthese dislocations were painless they caused a great deal of inconvenience. Thepoltergeist claimed it could not set them right, and other doctors and helpershad to be called in. On one occasion, a doctor who had just attended to adislocation was in a hurry to get away, and said he hoped he wouldn’t be neededagain; the sailor boy then cursed him with foul language, and dislocated anotherjoint on the spot.This had been going on for almost three years when a delegation from the localchurch—of which Larkin was a faithful and enthusiastic member—called on him toask about the strange rumors. Larkin explained quite openly, and was upset whenthe committee seemed to feel he had been guilty of “scandalous behavior,”possibly suspecting his motives in plunging Mary Jane into hypnotic sleep.Larkin defended himself, and offered to allow members of the committee to livein the house and observe the phenomena. They turned down this offer, but beganto behave like inquisitors, calling at all hours of the day and night andinterrogating Mary Jane, obviously hoping to find something incriminating.Finally, Larkin lost his temper and told them that they must conduct an orderlyinvestigation, or let him alone. So a Reverend Mr. Thatcher and his wife movedinto the Larkin household for a week. He saw Mary Jane go into trances, and onone occasion was much impressed by the prayers she offered up in this state. Mr.Thatcher wrote a report that was circulated to all the ministers concerned,asserting his “entire conviction of the supra-mundane character of the events hehad witnessed.” No one, he said, was attempting any kind of fraud or deception.But the ministers were far from satisfied. Larkin’s chief enemy, the ReverendHorace James, won over three magistrates to his side, and they ordered Larkin toappear in front of them. Mary Jane was seized and accused of “necromancy.” Shewas put on trial and sentenced to sixty days in solitary confinement in theDedham jail. Not long after being released, she died.Larkin himself was found not guilty, but the ministers told him he wasexcommunicated from the church until he “made full confession of his crimes.”Larkin protested that he believed “in the communion of spirits; did realize thatthey could and had through the organism of Mary Jane again and againcommunicated with him.” The Reverend James found this thoroughly unsatisfying,and demanded a full recantation; because he wanted to return to the church,Larkin signed a paper agreeing that his statements about communication “were thebiggest lie ever written.” Larkin, who later told the whole story to EmmaHardinge, said that he was ashamed of himself for denying the phenomena, but itwas the only way he could again be accepted into the church. Two years afterthese events, the whole country was talking about the strange goings-on in thehome of the Fox sisters and, within another two years, Spiritualism had sweptacross America. If the Larkin case had occurred in the mid-1850s instead of themid-1840s, there seems no doubt that it would have aroused widespread interestand sympathetic study; as it was, Larkin and Mary Jane were the victims of thewitch-hunting mentality.In retrospect, one of the oddest things about this whole period is that therewere so many “spirit manifestations” appearing simultaneously, with nopossibility of influencing one another. It looks almost as if the “spirits” haddecided to make a concerted effort to make human beings aware of theirexistence. An alternative possibility is that the discovery of mesmerism andhypnotism meant that far more doctors were placing their patients in a trance.And there seems good reason to believe that “spirits” can make use of the bodiesof certain people when they are in trance.At the same time that Larkin was “magnetizing” Mary Jane, a twenty-one-year-oldshoemaker named Andrew Jackson Davis was conducting experiments in hypnotism. Hehad been fascinated by a lecture on animal magnetism, and persuaded a localtailor to try and hypnotize him. It worked, and Davis, like Mary Jane, began todiagnose illnesses with the aid of the “spirits.” In 1844, on a country walk, heencountered two men who said they were the physician Galen and the mysticSwedenborg, and who told him that he was destined to become an importantteacher. In the following year, Davis encountered two men who decided to workwith him in carrying out his mission: a Dr. Lyon, of Bridgeport, Connecticut,and the Reverend William Fishbough. Dr. Lyon would hypnotize him, and then theReverend Fishbough would write down the revelations that came from him in atrance state. These amounted to a remarkable and sizable volume which appearedin 1847 under the title of The Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelation, anda Voice to Mankind. Podmore quotes long extracts from this work in his ModernSpiritualism, and it seems to be rather more interesting than he gives it creditfor. He describes the beginning of the universe as being an “unimaginable oceanof liquid fire,” and adds that “particles did not exist, but the whole was asone Particle”—a view that most astrophysicists would now endorse. When he speaksabout the origin of life, Davis makes the odd assertion that water is condensedlight, but goes on to make some interesting observations about the influence oflight on water which sound like an anticipation of photosynthesis; it soundseven more like the heterodox views of Wilhelm Reich on the creation of lifethrough “orgone energy.” Davis also predicts the existence of an eighth planetin the solar system—this was written about six months before the discovery ofthe planet Neptune. A third part of Davis’ book deals with his own plan (or thatof the spirits) for the reorganization of society—a kind of Christian socialism.The Principles of Nature became something of a bestseller, and the story of itscomposition undoubtedly prepared the American public for the revelations thatwere to come from Hydesville in 1849. Davis was, as we have seen, one of thewitnesses of the Phelps poltergeist case (see chapter 3), and made theinteresting comment that the raps were due to “discharges of vital electricity”from the organisms of the children concerned; but he also said that thedisturbances were caused by spirits—five in number.This same epoch also saw the emergence of the most remarkable of all spiritmediums—Daniel Dunglas Home, whose experience of “spirits” began in 1846, whenhe was thirteen (that is to say, three years before the Hydesville rappings).Home was a Scottish highlander—a race with a reputation for “second sight”—andclaimed to be the grandson of the Earl of Home (pronounced Hume) by a naturalson. At the age of nine, he traveled to America to live with his aunt, a Mrs.Cook. And in 1846 he had a vision of a friend named Edwin, who stood at the footof his bed and made three circles in the air; Home took this to mean he had diedthree days earlier, and this later proved to be correct. In 1850, Home’s motherdied, and the Cooks were alarmed by various poltergeist effects in theirhome—furniture sliding around, strange bangs and raps, which led his aunt toaccuse him of bringing the devil into her house. When the local minister beganpraying for Daniel’s soul, loud raps sounded from his chair. When the news ofthese events spread around the area, neighbors began calling at the house to askabout long-lost relatives or mislaid jewelry. At the end of the week, Mrs. Cookthrew him out, and threw his best suit after him.Home was lucky; he could hardly have timed his debut more perfectly. LeadingSpiritualists invited him to their homes, and he had no trouble making a namefor himself as a medium. And his powers were certainly extraordinary. He had noobjection to performing in a well-lit room and, within minutes, the table wasusually resounding to loud knocks and floating free of the ground. Shocks wouldmake the floor vibrate like artillery fire. Spirits of the dead spoke from hismouth, and his body would often float into the air—a phenomenon which had oncebeen regarded as a sure sign of demoniacal possessionHome was a good-looking young man with pleasing manners and a tenor voice; hebecame the favorite of any society he moved into, and a number of affectionateelderly people wanted to adopt him as a son. But, like many spirit mediums, heseems to have been in many ways a rather weak and neurotic character. (A modernpsychic, Robert Cracknell, has pointed out that a large number of mediums havehad disturbed childhoods, and that many are homosexual; a certain emotionalinstability seems essential to clairvoyance.) He was something of a snob, andwas fond of society. In 1856, the spirits became so exasperated with him thatthey told him he would lose his powers for one year. It happened as theypredicted, and his powers returned precisely one year later to the day.Throughout his life, Home performed spectacular feats. It was nothing for aheavy table to rise into the air when he was in trance, and float up to theceiling. At séances, trumpets sounded, tambourines played, raps sounded from allover the room, birds sang, ducks squawked, water splashed and spirit voices sangand spoke. Heavy articles of furniture—like grand pianos—floated around likethistledown. Meanwhile, Home sat in full view of everybody, separated from themain circle, often tied hand and foot to his chair. Hundreds of unimpeachablewitnesses testified to these phenomena. In the 1860s he became a friend of ayoung man called Lord Adare, an Irish peer with no interest in Spiritualism, andAdare subsequently wrote a book about the phenomena he saw during this period offriendship. Dead people materialized in the room and held conversations, lookingas solid as the living. Home would take live coals from the fireplace, blow themto red heat, and hand them to other people who would find them quite cold—solong as they held them. On one occasion, he floated out of a third-story windowwhich was open only about a foot—and floated in by another. When Adare asked himto repeat it, Home floated off the floor, became horizontal, and popped in andout of the open window like a shuttle. Standing against a wall, his legs andwaist tightly held, he could increase his height by eight inches.Home was responsible for the “conversion” of a young physicist, William Crookes,to an interest in psychic phenomena. Crookes investigated Home, expecting todiscover fraud, and was amazed by what he witnessed. Fellow scientists werescandalized and contemptuous when Crookes published his reports on Home, andDarwin said he could not disbelieve Crookes’ statements or believe his results.Crookes was one of the many scientists—Sir William Barrett and Sir Oliver Lodgewere others—who studied “spirit” phenomena objectively, and arrived at theconclusion that there was no basic deception. Home made an admirable subject forsuch study. There was never the slightest breath of suspicion of fraud(Browning’s poem “Mr. Sludge the Medium”—about Home—was an outright slander),and the phenomena were all so amazing and clear-cut that there could be littledispute about interpretation. In fact, anyone who reads Crookes’ papers onHome[1] will find it incomprehensible how any scientific researcher can stillregard the basic facts of “spirit manifestation” as unproved; either Crookes waslying, or they are proved as unambiguously as the existence of the planets. InHome’s case, it may be the sheer variety of the phenomena that caused a kindof bewilderment.Studying Home’s life—he retired at the age of thirty-nine, and died fourteenyears later—also makes it clear that most of the “telepathic” and“psychokinetic” explanations of the phenomena are simply inadequate. Homehimself had no doubt whatsoever that everything he did was due to Spirits who“used” him. His first experience was the vision of his dead friend Edwin. Hissecond was sudden knowledge of his mother’s death; and from then on, “spirits ofthe dead” played a constant part in his career. When Home attended a lecture onCagliostro, the great charlatan himself materialized in his bedroom later, andsat on the bed talking to Home and his wife Sacha. After Sacha’s death, shematerialized in the room when Adare was present, looking quite solid and kissedHome. When the famous actress Adah Mencken died, she took possession of Home,and had a long talk with Adare (who had known her). At Adare Manor, Home saw aghost wandering around and went and engaged it in conversation; his companionscould see both Home and the ghost quite clearly in the moonlight. When Home leftthe ghost, he floated toward them at a height of two feet from the ground. In anItalian villa in Florence, Home raised the spirit of an Italian monk namedGiannana, who had committed murder; the old man had been wandering restlesslyaround the house ever since his death, and Home persuaded him to go away. Themonk’s hands were materialized for inspection; they had skinny yellow fingersand were cold to the touch. In another villa, rented by Mr. and Mrs. HiramPowers, there were poltergeist disturbances, and a spirit explained that thesewere caused by no less than twenty-seven dead monks “who must have been veryimproper persons in their lifetime, judging by the indecorousness of theirbehavior.” They tugged Mrs. Powers’ skirt hard enough to break the cotton whereit held “gathers.” These monks also agreed to leave quietly after making thesign of the cross “in a way that conveyed the sense of something devilish andspiteful”—a fair description of most poltergeists. (It is interesting tospeculate why so many monks are involved in hauntings; possibly the generalunsatisfactoriness of their lives, and the frustration of sexual energies mayprovide the basis for an explanation.)In short, Home himself never had the slightest doubt that his powers came fromspirits; there was no question of unconscious psychokinesis; and reading themany detailed accounts of his manifestations it is hard to reject hisexplanation.When the Society for Psychical Research was formed in 1882—by men like SirWilliam Barrett, F. W. H. Myers, Henry Sidgwick and Edmund Gurney—its foundersentertained a hope that now strikes us as absurdly optimistic. They felt thatpsychic science was now about to take its place among the respectable sciencesand that, within a decade or so, man would know as much about the soul and lifeafter death as he knows about stars and atoms. The phenomena seemed real enough,which meant that the “facts” behind them must be equally real and solid; so itwas simply a matter of discovering these facts and verifying them by scientifictesting.And why did this hope come to nothing? The answer that has suggested itselfthroughout the course of this book is that studying spirits is not quite asstraightforward as studying, say, Australian or African aborigines. Kardec seemsto have been lucky in his choice of mediums, and to have obtained sensible andconsistent answers to his questions. His “system” remains the most impressivethat has so far emerged in the history of Spiritualism. But even Kardec came torealize that many spirits—apparently the majority who hang around the earth—haveno desire whatever to cooperate with human beings in discovering the truth about“the other side.” In short, as Chesterton says, spirits tell lies. They also dotheir best to confuse the earnest investigator. They seldom manifest themselveswhen expected to, and when they do choose to make their presence felt, their aimoften seems to be to create confusion and bewilderment. To judge by poltergeistphenomena, most of the accessible spirit world seems to be made up ofbloody-minded anarchists with a slightly sadistic sense of humor.Where the early ghost-hunters were concerned, these problems were sometimesaccentuated by a certain naivete of approach. Robert Dale Owen, son of thefamous socialist pioneer Robert Owen, began as a determined skeptic who deploredhis father’s conversion to Spiritualism; but when he became American Charged’Affaires in Naples, he encountered Daniel Dunglas Home,and—understandably—became totally convinced. Owen made a vow that he would notrest until he had proved survival after death either a certainty or a delusion.His conclusions appeared in a work called Footfalls on the Boundary of AnotherWorld, which appeared in 1860. It is an admirable work, full of interestingstories, and it became immensely popular. In his second “inquiry,” The DebatableLand Between this World and the Next (1874), Owen shows his hand: “In thefollowing pages I seek to show that Religion, such as Christ taught, though sureto prevail in the end, is yet, for the time, hard pressed.” And accordingly, theSpirit World is to be called to its defense. But why should life after deathprove the truth of religion, any more than life before death does? It may“prove” that man is a spirit, but even an agnostic can believe that by decidingthat he is more than a mere machine.In short, by mixing up their psychical investigations with their religiousconvictions, men like Owen brought the “spirit world” into disrepute with thescientists. Catherine Crowe—author of The Night Side of Nature—kept her religionand her “facts” in separate compartments; few later writers show the samerestraint. This is a pity, for what they have to say is often important. In1924, an American doctor named Carl Wickland brought out a book called ThirtyYears Among the Dead, describing his wife’s experiences of mediumship. A seriesof spirits speak through the medium, and are instructed and sermonized by Dr.Wickland. On June 6, 1907, the spirit was a criminal called Charles the Fighter,who seems to be under the influence of drink, and threatens to have everybodyshot. When told that he is using the body of a medium, and ordered to look ather hands, he shrinks in terror, and explains that he once cut off a woman’shand to get her diamond ring. He looks around and gasps: “Have I killed allthose people? Have they all come to accuse me?” And finally, he tells his lifestory, his “hideous career of crime,” how he stole to buy whiskey and drank todrown his conscience. Killed in a brawl in 1870, he did not even realize he wasdead, and went on trying to commit crimes—when he hit a policeman, he waspuzzled that the club went through his head. After being lectured on the “law ofcause and effect,” Charles the Fighter sees his mother standing beside him, andthe hardened criminal cowered in his seat and wept piteously . . . Crushed byguilt and remorse he cried abjectly: “I cannot go with you! Dear mother, don’task me to go with you! You must go back to heaven, and I must go to hell, whereI belong . . .” But maternal love prevailed and the spirit, humble and penitent,followed his mother.But immediately after this scene from a Victorian melodrama, there is an accountof a séance with a man called Harry Hayward, who had his girlfriend murdered andwas himself hanged in 1894; it carries the ring of truth. A female invalid withpsychic abilities began to develop a craving for ice cream, but felt herselfchoking when she tried to eat it. She flung open a window and ordered any“spirit entities” to leave the place. That evening, at Wickland’s séance, aspirit identified itself as Harry Hayward, and said that he had a craving forice cream, and had tried to get some earlier that day, but had been “chased awayby a woman.” He talked about his trial and execution, mentioning a guard withwhom he spent a great deal of time playing cards. Wickland said he thought thisman was dead; the spirit replied “No, he’s not dead. I see him playing cards athis son’s home in Minneapolis.” This, says Wickland, later proved to be true.What Hayward says about his craving for ice cream brings to mind Guy Playfair’scomment that earth-bound spirits long for the things they enjoyed while alive.And the experience of the invalid lady—the sudden desire for ice cream, and thechoking sensation when she tried to eat it—would be explained by Kardec as anexample of the type of minor “possession” that occurs all the time. Kardec, itwill be recalled, said that our thoughts and actions are constantly influencedby spirits. People who can be fully “possessed” are called mediums; most of us,fortunately, have only feeble mediumistic powers. But spirits can still wanderin and out of our bodies at will. So the Spiritist explanation of what happenedto the invalid is that she was a natural medium—the text makes it clear that shewas aware of this—and Hayward managed to “possess” her to the extent of makingher long for ice cream. But in order to enjoy the ice cream vicariously, he hadto “take over” her body. As he tried to do this, the lady began tochoke—presumably because Hayward had been hanged—and she realized what washappening and threw him out.Anita Gregory, an eminent psychical investigator, discusses Wickland’s ThirtyYears Among the Dead in her introduction to Oesterreich’s book on possession,and dismisses it as an example of self-deception. The cases cited above suggestthat it is not as simple as this. Mrs. Wickland was a genuine medium, and nodoubt most of the phenomena were genuine. But Wickland is simply imposing hisown preconceptions on every thing he witnesses. And séances are fairly easy toinfluence in this way. In The Occult, I have quoted the case of Louis Singer,who deliberately experimented with suggestion and telepathy at a séance.One of the sitters announced she could see lights, I too giving my consent as Iwas too polite to disagree. Another said she could feel a wind. Again agreement,to which I assented. Then for a while, nothing. At last I felt it was my turn,so I remarked it was getting lighter. This met with concurrence. Indeed, onewent so far as to remark upon the beautiful lights that played around me. I thensuggested I felt a wind. So did everybody present. Later the trumpetmiraculously floated into the air, the voice recognized by one sitter as arelative spoke. They were all certain it was not the medium’s voice, and not toocleverly disguised.So Singer decided to try to influence the séance by telepathy. A dog basket madehim think of a coracle, and he visualized one. By accident, one chair too manyhad been put in the circle, and the medium suggested that they leave it for aspirit to occupy.Sure enough, a spirit invisible to us occupied it. It was, the medium said, adrowned sailor. After this, I tried on more than one occasion to dictate whatspirit should come through, using the method of visual projection. I was largelysuccessful . . .All this seems to suggest that séances are entirely a matter of self-deception:that is, of some unexplored power of the human mind, directed by our ownpreconceptions. But in that case, how did the trumpet float into the air? Howdid Daniel Dunglas Home make tables float up to the ceiling? We have to fallback on the idea of “spontaneous psychokinesis,” and we have already seen thatthis is simply inadequate to cover the facts of poltergeist hauntings. So thesensible position would seem to be somewhere midway between the two: that is,that spirits do exist, but that the phenomena they cause is very easilyinfluenced by the human mind. We have seen that poltergeists are frequentlyinfluenced by what people say; in the Enfield case, one investigator visitingthe house mentioned that he had just come from a case where the poltergeistcaused fires; the Enfield poltergeist immediately acted upon the suggestion. TheDagg poltergeist did not seem to be sure whether it was supposed to be a devilor an angel; it seemed quite prepared to be whatever people wanted it to be. Andthis is the basic cause of the failure of psychical research. If we know aslittle about “the spirit world” now as we did a century ago, it is because wekeep on imposing our own preconceptions and prejudices, and the “facts” becomehopelessly muddled with our interpretation of them. The early investigatorsinsisted on mixing religion with psychical research; the result, predictably,was that Spiritualism seemed to confirm the Christian faith.But within twenty years of the founding of Spiritualism (around 1850) there wasalready a strong reaction against this tendency. In Ireland, a professor ofphysics called William Barrett used to stay with a friend in the country, andbecame interested in his friends experiments in mesmerism with the villagechildren. One little girl became strongly telepathic as soon as she was placedin a trance. If the experimenter held his hand over a lighted lamp, the girl—whowas facing the other way—instantly snatched her own hand away as if it wasburnt. If he tasted sugar, she looked pleased, while salt made her grimace. InFrance, the psychologist Pierre Janet investigated a case in which a peasantwoman could be put into a hypnotic trance when the hypnotist simply thoughtabout it—even at a distance. Another investigator, Dr. Julian Ochorowicz,studied a “somnambule” called Madame Lucille, who, when in a trance, was able totell him what he was doing behind her back. A boy investigated by Ochorowiczcould even repeat aloud the words that Ochorowicz was reading in a book. Allthis seemed to prove beyond all doubt that the human mind has some curiousunknown power to influence other minds. Janet pointed out that if his hypnotisttried to hypnotize the peasant woman without concentrating on what he was doing,she remained unhypnotized. Yet when he concentrated hard, he could evenhypnotize her at a distance. Obviously, the mind itself has some peculiar power,a kind of radar beam of will. (In Mysteries, I have described a simpleexperiment by which any group of people can verify this; it was first shown tome by the theater historian John Kennedy Melling. Two or three people standaround the person who has been selected as the subject, and the subject closeshis eyes. The others then press their fingertips lightly against the subject’sbody, at shoulder level, then withdraw them so they are a few inches away. Thewhole group now concentrates on forcing the subject to sway in a definitedirection, chosen at random by one of the group. When I first tried theexperiment, acting as subject, I was astonished to feel a curious force pushingme in a certain direction—the direction chosen by those standing around me. Ifthe subject tries to resist, the result is usually a feeling of dizziness. Aninteresting extension of this experiment is to try to move a paper roundabout,balanced on a needle, by will-power. The roundabout is made by taking a smallsquare of paper, about an inch square, folding it four times—like the crosses ona Union Jack—and then pinching the four folds to make a paper dart, which isthen balanced on a needle stuck in a cork. The hands should then be gentlycupped around the “roundabout.” Most people will try making tremendous effortsof will and produce no effect—as I did myself the first time I tried it. Thetrick seems to be visualizing the roundabout turning one way or the other as youexert the will. With a little practice, most people can make the roundabout turnclockwise, then stop, then turn counter-clockwise.)It was these experiments in will-power and hypnosis that convinced Barrett thatan unknown human faculty was waiting to be investigated; and, together with aspiritualist called Edmund Dawson Rogers, he decided to found a Society forPsychical Research. It came into being in 1882, and one of its chief tasks wasto study examples of “paranormal occurrences,” and take evidence from as manywitnesses as possible. They soon began to accumulate a considerable body ofevidence on one particular subject: the so-called “phantasms of the living”—whenthe “ghost” of a living person is seen at some distance from his physical body.A typical example concerns the poet Goethe who was walking home one day after aheavy shower when he saw a friend named Friedrich walking in front of him; whatsurprised him was that Friedrich was wearing his—Goethe’s—dressing-gown. When hegot home, he found Friedrich in front of the fire, wearing the dressing-gown—hehad been caught in the shower, taken off his wet coat, and borrowed Goethe’sdressing-gown. The SPR collected hundreds of similar cases. Many of these wereconcerned with “crisis apparitions”—people seeing a relative who was seriouslyill or on the point of death. The immense work Phantasms of the Living (1886) byGurney, Myers and Podmore contains hundreds of such cases. And what it seems todemonstrate beyond all doubt is that human beings have the ability to project animage of themselves—a quite solid-looking image—to distant places.What is odder still is that, in most cases, the “projector” has no idea that heis being seen elsewhere, and no particular reason for wanting to be seenelsewhere. There is, for example, the curious case of Canon Bourne, cited by G.N. M. Tyrrell in Apparitions. Canon Bourne was out hunting with his twodaughters when the girls decided to return home. On their way home, the girlssaw their father, looking dirty and dishevelled, waving to them from the otherside of the valley. When they reached the place, there was no sign of him. Theysearched the area, then went home. Their father arrived home soonafterwards—quite unhurt. He could not explain why he had “appeared” to hisdaughters, and neither could they. One odd point is that one of the girlsnoticed the maker’s name inside their father’s hat as he waved it to them—whichwould obviously have been impossible at such a distance. This seems to suggestthat it was their minds rather than their eyes that were seeing him. Yet bothgirls and the coachman saw the figure clearly.Now cases like these may be quite bewildering, but they seem to make one thingperfectly clear: that there is far more to human beings than meets the eye. Infact, they seem to suggest that we are making a false distinction when we talkabout “ghosts” as if they were quite distinct from living people. It wouldprobably be more accurate to say that human beings are ghosts—ghosts withbodies.Faced with such a mass of evidence, this conclusion—or something very likeit—slowly forced itself upon even the most skeptical members of the SPR. So bythe beginning of the twentieth century, a new theory of Spiritualism haddeveloped, according to which there is no need to suppose that the world is fullof invisible “spirits.” Man himself could be the invisible spirit who causestables to rise into the air and trumpets to play themselves. And if poltergeistsseem to require a disturbed child or teenager at the center of the disturbances,then perhaps the child is the poltergeist? This, as we have seen, is the viewthat still prevails today. One of the aims of this book is to demonstrate thatit is unsatisfactory.By the time Lombroso died, in 1909, psychical research was marking time.Spiritualism continued to flourish; but as scientific investigation, it had cometo a halt. The reason can be seen by anyone who reads Owen’s Footfalls on theBoundary of Another World and then turns to Lombroso’s After Death—What? Thebooks were published fifty years apart; yet they might both have been written atexactly the same time. Lombroso offers some “scientific evidence,” by way of afew experiments in telepathy; otherwise, he presents just the same kind ofevidence that Robert Dale Owen had presented. There was plenty of evidence forghosts, for poltergeists, for telepathy, for precognition, for “out of the bodyexperiences,” and a dozen other varieties of “paranormal” experience. But theevidence seemed to lead nowhere. One remarkable case had even proved life afterdeath, to the satisfaction of most open-minded inquirers. This was thecelebrated “cross-correspondences.” By 1904 three of the chief founders of theSPR—Henry Sidgwick. Frederick Myers and Edmund Gurney—were dead, and it seemedlogical to hope that if they were still alive in another world, they would tryto communicate through mediums. In the previous year, a psychic named Mrs.Holland, the sister of Rudyard Kipling, began receiving written messages—throughautomatic writing—that seemed far more intelligent and thoughtful than themajority of such scripts. And in 1904, another psychic; Mrs. Verrall, the wifeof a Cambridge don, also received some messages, one of which included the words“Record the bits, and when fitted they will make the whole.”And it slowly became clear that the “senders” claimed to be the spirits ofSidgwick, Myers and Gurney, and that what they were attempting was a “proof” ofsuch complexity that there could be no possibility of fraud. In effect, theyseemed to be using a large number of mediums—others included Mrs. Flemming, Mrs.Forbes, and the famous American medium Mrs. Piper—to produce a complex jigsawpuzzle or conundrum, giving each woman only part of the puzzle, so that therecould be no possible doubt that there was no collusion between them.Unfortunately, the conundrums were so complex that it would take a short bookeven to give a simple outline. A typical one is as follows:In 1906, Mrs. Flemming produced a script containing the words Dawn, Evening, andMorning, a reference to bay leaves, and the name Laurence. Six weeks later, Mrs.Verrall wrote out a message mentioning “laurel” and a library. Mrs. Piper cameout of a trance speaking of laurel, “nigger,” and a phrase that sounded like“more head.” Mrs. Flemming produced more scripts referring to Night and Day,Evening and Morning, and also a reference to Alexander’s tomb with laurelleaves. And eventually, all these clues pointed to the tomb of the Medicis inthe Church of San Lorenzo in Florence. It had been designed by Michelangelo, andcontained his sculpture of Night and Day, Evening and Morning. Lorenzo deMedici’s emblem was the laurel, and near the tombs is the Laurentian Library.Alexander (or Alessandro) de Medici was half negro; after his murder, his bodywas hidden in the tomb of Giuliano. “More head” was actually “Moor head”—thehead of a negro. This conundrum was solved only four years after the first“clue,” and there could be no question of telepathy between the mediums, sincethey did not understand what it was all about. Altogether, the case of thecross-correspondences is one of the most impressive—perhaps the mostimpressive—in the history of psychical research. It is true that the various“clues” are so complicated that few people have ever taken the trouble to studythe case. Yet the sheer complexity of the code at least indicates that itoriginated on a far higher level of intelligence than most spirit messages. Inaddition to which, it effectively disposes of the objection that spirits neverhave anything interesting to say.If the “spirits” of Myers, Gurney and Sidgwick failed to convince the world ofthe reality of the afterlife, a far more skillful and flamboyant publicist wasnow preparing to launch himself into the project.Harry Price, ghost-hunter extraordinary, claimed that he was born in Shrewsbury,son of a wealthy paper manufacturer. A brilliant critical biography by TrevorHall, The Search for Harry Price, reveals that he was, in fact, the son of anunsuccessful grocer, and that he was born in London in 1881. From then until hewas about forty, he seems to have supported himself by a variety of jobs,including commercial traveling, manufacturing patent medicines, journalism andgiving gramophone concerts. What is certain is that his lifelong interest instage magic began at the age of eight, when he saw an itinerant magician andpatent medicine salesman, the Great Sequah, giving a public performance. Pricebegan collecting books on magic, and became an expert magician. It may have beenthe interest in magic that led him to join the Society for Psychical Research in1920—the SPR was then, as now, much concerned with trying to detect fraud inmediums. E. J. Dingwall, who was then Research Officer for the Society, askedPrice if he would care to come with him to Munich, to attend some séances of aremarkable German medium, Willi Schneider—one of two brothers. The man whoarranged the séances was the German investigator, Baron von Schrenk-Notzing, afriend of Lombroso’s, and the author of a sensationally successful book calledMaterialization Phenomena, which had aroused widespread skepticism in Germanywhen it appeared in 1914. Schrenk-Notzing himself was something of a flamboyantpublicist, and Trevor Hall suggests that Harry Price took his example to heart,and decided that this was the way to achieve the fame he craved. (He admittedfrankly that he had always wanted to get his name in Who’s Who.)The Schneider brothers, Willi and Rudi, the most psychic members of a psychicfamily, were born at Braunau am Inn and, according to one friend of the family,the phenomena began after they had spent an evening playing with a Ouija board.Willi had then reached the age of puberty—in 1916—and the family was disturbedby loud knocking noises. Then objects began moving around, and Willi saw a ghostin the sitting room. Neighbors became so alarmed about the racket that thefamily were on the point of vacating the flat. By means of the ouija board, theytried questioning the “spirit,” which identified itself as a girl named OlgaLindtner, who claimed to be a reincarnation of the notorious Lola Montez. In duecourse, Willi went into a trance, and Olga spoke through him. In spite of doubtslater raised by Harry Price—after he had quarreled with the brothers—there canbe no doubt that the phenomena were genuine. The novelist Thomas Mann attendedone séance, and has recorded how, as he pressed Willi’s knees tightly betweenhis own, and two other people held his hands, a handkerchief floated into theair, a bell began to ring and then floated into the air, a music box played, andthe keys of a typewriter were struck. Mann was convinced that deception wasimpossible.Harry Price and E. J. Dingwall witnessed similar occurrences, and also saw awhite hand which materialized in front of them; they had no doubt whatever ofthe genuineness of the phenomena, and said as much at a lecture to the SPR. Butby way of keeping his options open, Price helped to edit and publish a bookcalled Revelations of a Spirit Medium, in which a fake medium described thetricks of the trade.In 1923, Price got into conversation with a young nurse on a train; her name wasStella Cranshawe. He was fascinated to hear that mild poltergeist phenomenaoccurred around her—a feeling like a breeze, movement of small objects, rappingnoises, and flashes of light. By this time, Price knew enough about psychicalresearch to realize that the girl was probably, without knowing it, a medium. Hepersuaded her to allow herself to be investigated. And at the first séance, aheavy table levitated and moved across the room on two legs, raps sounded,lights flashed, and the temperature in the room dropped considerably. (At latersittings it became very low indeed.) At another séance, the table hit HarryPrice under the chin, then three of its legs snapped off, the top broke into twopieces, then the whole table crumbled into matchwood. Stella herself found allthese phenomena rather boring and, after she married in 1928, refused to takeany part in further experiments. It is possible, in any case, that her powerswould have vanished with marriage; many investigators have noted that there is aconnection between sexual frustration and “poltergeist effects,” and that sucheffects cease when the “focus” leads a normal sex life. (She may also have feltthat séances were bad for her health—they often leave the medium exhausted.)In 1926, Price came upon one of the most remarkable poltergeist cases of alltime. In February 1925, a thirteen-year-old Rumanian peasant girl calledEleonora Zugun went to visit her grandmother at the village of Buhai, and on theway found some money by the roadside, which she spent on sweets. Hergrandmother, who was 105 years old, and had a reputation as a witch, toldEleonora that the money had been left by the devil, and that she would now bepossessed by the devil. The next day, stones rained down on the house, smashingwindows and small objects near Eleonora rose up in the air. Eleonora was quicklysent home to Talpa, and the phenomena continued there. A jug full of water roseslowly in the air and floated several feet. A trunk rocked up and down. Aporridge bowl hit a visitor on the head and made a nasty wound. Eleonora wassent to a nearby monastery, then shut in a lunatic asylum. A psychicalresearcher managed to get her removed and taken back to the monastery. There hewitnessed all kinds of things flying through the air. The “spirit” also beganslapping the girl. Then a countess with an interest in psychical research—ZöeWassilko-Serecki—heard about Eleonora, went to see her, and brought her backwith her to Vienna. Eleonora was delighted with her new life in the countess’flat, and began training as a hairdresser. And the poltergeist phenomenacontinued—indicating perhaps that a poltergeist does not need a psychologically“disturbed” teenager for its manifestations. The countess observed what mostother researchers into poltergeist activity have noted: that the poltergeistseems to dislike anyone actually seeing it move objects; the countess noted thatvarious small items would fall from the air without being seen to move fromtheir original place. The poltergeist—or dracu (demon) as Eleonora calledit—communicated by automatic writing, even spoke a few sentences in a “breathyand toneless voice.” But what it had to say indicated that its level ofintelligence was extremely low.The dracu also punched and slapped Eleonora, threw her out of bed, pulled herhair, filled her shoes with water (the poltergeist seems to be able to createwater, as we have seen), and stole her favorite possessions. In March 1926, itbegan scratching and biting her, as well as sticking needles into her. The bitemarks were often damp with saliva.Price came to Vienna at the end of April 1926, and was soon convinced that thiswas a genuine poltergeist. He took her back to London, where she was subjectedto laboratory tests. The movement of objects was less violent than in Vienna,but the bites and scratches continued to appear. One day, when she was tying upa parcel in front of several witnesses, she gave a gasp, and teeth marksappeared on her wrist, then scratches appeared on her forearm, cheeks andforehead.Back in Vienna, the movement of objects ceased, but the scratches and bitescontinued, now often accompanied by quantities of an unpleasant spittle.Subjected to chemical analysis, this was found to be swarming withmicro-organisms (whereas Eleonora’s own saliva was relatively free from them).When she went to Berlin to be studied by Schrenk-Notzing, a researcher namedHans Rosenbusch accused her of cheating—with the co-operation of the countess;but this seems to be typical of the extreme skepticism of certain investigators.Finally, in 1927, the “spirit” got tired of tormenting her, and went away. Shemoved to Czernowitz, in Rumania, and ran a successful hairdressing business.The countess was convinced that Eleonora herself—or rather, her unconsciousmind—was responsible for the attacks: she believed that Eleonora had powerfullydeveloped sexual urges, and that these were fixated on her father (it sounds asif she had been impressed by Freud); so the “attacks” were a form ofself-punishment. Harry Price was inclined to agree, likening the bites to the“stigmata” that appear on the hands of saints and religious fanatics. Yet as weread the account of Eleanor’s sufferings at the hands of the dracu (there is anexcellent account in Alan Gauld’s Poltergeists), these explanations seem moreand more preposterous. A girl does not go on scratching and biting herself fortwo years because she feels guilty about her sexual desires, particularly if shefinds herself transformed, like Cinderella, into the protégée of a wealthycountess. Then what exactly happened?Clearly, the grandmother was in some way responsible for “triggering” theattacks. Eleonora had reached the age—thirteen—at which such things happen; shewas not particularly happy in her present surroundings in Talpa, so there was anunderlying sense of frustration. Peasants are superstitious, and when hergrandmother told her that from now on she would belong to the devil and neverget rid of him, the effect must have been traumatic. Eleonora’s energies beganto “leak.” And some delinquent entity saw its chance, and made use of them. Itmay or may not be relevant that her grandmother had a reputation as a witch. Ifmagic—and presumably witchcraft—makes use of “spirits,” as Playfair suggests,then her grandmother’s house may have been the worst possible place for afrustrated adolescent like Eleonora. (This matter of witchcraft is a subject towhich we shall return in the final chapter.)As to Harry Price, he continued his triumphant career as the chief publicrelations officer of the spirit world. He investigated fire walking and theIndian rope trick, organized séances, was photographed in “haunted beds” (with“Professor” Joad), and staged an experiment on the summit of the Brocken to tryto change a goat into a young man. (This was a failure.) Price loved publicity,and lost no opportunity to be photographed by journalists. He was delighted thatso many correspondents seemed to think that his name was Sir Harry Price. Yet healso made the general public conscious of psychical research in a way it hadnever been before. Because Price emphasized that he was a skeptic and ascientist, not a Spiritualist, people took him more seriously than they did a“believer” like Conan Doyle or Sir Oliver Lodge. When he announced in 1933 thathe now felt that Rudi Schneider might be a fake, and produced a photograph thatseemed to show him cheating during a séance, people felt that he was showingunflinching honesty. (In fact, the photograph was later shown to be a fake;Price’s motive was almost certainly desire to get his own back on Rudi for, ashe saw it, “deserting” him for another investigator, Lord Charles Hope, whosefindings Price denounced.)Yet in spite of his craving for publicity and his desire to get into Who’s Who,Price did much important and valuable work during these years. In a sense, hismotivation is irrelevant; he was a genuine enthusiast for psychical research.The majority of his investigations were not spectacular: just the plodding,day-to-day work of a patient researcher, sitting with mediums, psychometrists,healers, miracle workers. And, if anything, Price was inclined to beover-critical. In Norway, he visited the home of Judge Ludwig Dahl, and had asitting with the judge’s daughter lngeborg, whose “controls” were her two deadbrothers. While not regarding her as a downright fake, Price was unimpressed.Yet one of the dead brothers prophesied that their father would die on August 8,1934, seven years later, and this was precisely the day on which he did die froma stroke during a swim.A case which certainly deserves mention in any account of Price’s career is thecurious affair of the talking mongoose of Cashen’s Gap. It was far from beingone of Price’s successes; yet it remains an intriguing mystery.In 1932, Price heard about a farmer called Irving, at Cashen’s Gap on the Isleof Man, who had made friends with a mongoose that could speak several languages.It could also read minds and sing hymns. Price could not find time to go to theIsle of Man, but a friend of his, a Captain M. H. Macdonald, offered to go.It seemed that the Irving family—who (significantly) had a thirteen-year-olddaughter named Voirrey—had been disturbed by noises from behind the panels ofthe house: barking, spitting and blowing noises. The farmer lay in wait with agun, without success, and tried putting down poison; the creature eluded him. Sothe farmer tried communicating with it, making various animal noises; to hisastonishment, it seemed to be able to imitate them. Voirrey tried nurseryrhymes, and it began to repeat these. Finally, it showed itself—a small,bushy-tailed creature that claimed to be a mongoose. They called it Gef. And Geftold them he was from India. Mr. Irving seldom saw Gef, except in glimpses, ashe ran along a beam, but Voirrey and Mrs. Irving often saw him face to face.Macdonald arrived at the farm on February 26, 1932, and saw nothing; when heleft to go to his hotel a shrill voice screamed: “Go away! Who is that man?” Thefarmer said this was Gef. The next day, as Macdonald was having tea with theIrvings, a large needle bounced off the teapot; and Irving remarked that Gef wasalways throwing things. Later, he heard the shrill voice upstairs talking withVoirrey and Mrs. Irving; when he called to ask if the mongoose would come down,the voice screamed: “No, I don’t like you.” He tried sneaking upstairs, but themongoose heard a stair creak, and shrieked: “He’s coming!” And from then on,Macdonald saw and heard no more of Gef.According to Irving, who kept a diary, Gef talked in a language he claimed to beRussian, sang in Spanish and recited a poem in Welsh. He killed rabbits forthem—by strangling them—and left them outside. He claimed to have made visits tothe nearest town, and told the Irvings what various people had been doing;Irving checked and found this was correct. He was able to tell Irving what washappening ten miles away without leaving the farm. And when he was asked if hewas a spirit, Gef replied: “I am an earth-bound spirit.”In March 1935, Gef told Irving that he had plucked some hairs from his tail andleft them on the mantelpiece; these were forwarded to Price, who had themexamined. They proved to be dog hairs—probably from the collie dog on the farm.When Harry Price was mentioned, Gef said he didn’t like him because he “had hisdoubting cap on.” And when Price finally visited Cashen’s Gap, the visit was awaste of time. Gef only came back to the farm after Price had left. And this,virtually, was the end of the story—although Macdonald paid a second visit tothe farm and again heard the mongoose talking in its shrill voice.It is possible, of course, that the Irvings were hoaxers. But they struck theinvestigators as honest. And it is difficult to see why, if they wantedattention, they should invent anything as bizarre as a talking mongoose. Whyshould Irving have invited Price to stay if he was simply a hoaxer?What seems rather more probable is that Gef was a poltergeist—an “earth-boundspirit,” as he himself claimed. Voirrey was a lonely girl who had just reachedpuberty. The disturbances started like most poltergeist disturbances, withnoises in the woodwork, scratchings and other sounds. Later small objects flewthrough the air, and Gef was assumed to have “thrown” them. But he also seemedto be able to cause “action at a distance”; when a saucepan of water turned overon the stove and soaked Irving’s shoes, he assumed this was Gef. Theclairvoyance also sounds like a poltergeist, and the knowledge of other people’saffairs. And it seems odd that the rabbits were strangled—not a mongoose’snormal method of killing. In fact, the Gef case seems to belong on theborderland between the straightforward poltergeist and the elemental orhobgoblin. (In the mid-nineteenth century, as Robert Dale Owen points out, theword poltergeist was usually translated “hobgoblin.”)Trevor Hall is of the opinion that the poltergeist case which Price claimed tobe his first experience of “ghost hunting” was pure invention, and he could beright—Price says that it took place when he was fifteen, at a village which hecalls Parton Magna; but since the rest of the details concern his wealthyrelatives and his return to a public school, we are probably safe in assuming itnever took place. But with Price, one can never be sure. In Confessions of aGhost Hunter (1936), he has a chapter called “The Strange Exploits of a LondonPoltergeist,” in which he states that he is forced to disguise the names and thelocation because it occurred so recently. But the case which he goes on todescribe is thoroughly well authenticated, and is, in fact, one of the mostremarkable of this century.It actually took place in Number 8 Eland Road, Battersea, and began on November,29, 1927, when lumps of coal, chunks of washing soda, and copper coins began torain down on the conservatory roof. The house was occupied by aneighty-six-year-old invalid, Henry Robinson, his son Frederick (twenty-seven),his three daughters, and a grandson of fourteen, Peter. When some of the fallingobjects smashed the glass, they sent for the police. As the constable stood inthe back garden, a lump of coal knocked off his helmet. He rushed to the gardenwall and pulled himself up—but there was no one around.The Robinsons’ washerwoman was terrified when she went into the wash-house andfound the place full of smoke, and a pile of red hot cinders on the floor; shegave notice.Then the poltergeist began to get into its stride—and it was an exceptionallydestructive spirit. Ornaments smashed against walls, articles of furnitureoverturned, windows were broken. When they moved the old man out of his bedroom,a huge chest of drawers toppled over; a few minutes later the hall stand beganto move, and broke in two when Frederick tried to hold it.In January, an out-of-work journalist named Jane Cunningham was passing thehouse when she heard an almighty crash. A young man in shirtsleeves ran out.Jane grabbed her notebook and went in to investigate. This time, the poltergeisthad smashed the whole conservatory just as if it had placed a bomb in it—allover the garden there were glass, lumps of coal and washing soda—and pennies.Her report on the occurrence led to widespread press interest in the case.Price went to see the house, and the poltergeist threw a gas-lighter past him;otherwise, nothing much happened. Soon afterwards, Frederick had a mentalbreakdown and had to be sent to a hospital. Chairs marched down the hallway insingle file. When Mrs. Perkins—the mother of the boy Peter—tried to lay thetable, chairs kept scattering all the crockery.Price assumed that Peter was the “focus” and suggested he should be sent away;he went to stay with relatives in the country. But the poltergeist remained.Objects continued to be thrown around. The old man had to be removed to ahospital, and one of the daughters fell ill. The police could only advise thefamily to vacate the house for the time being, which they did, staying withfriends.A medium held a séance in the house, and began to shiver. But she wasunsuccessful in identifying the “spirit.” Price paid another visit, with anewspaperman, and more objects were thrown—although not when anyone waswatching. Finally, Frederick Robinson came home from the mental home where hehad been confined, and quickly moved the whole family elsewhere. This wasvirtually the end of the story.Yet there was a postscript. Price had heard that small slips of paper withwriting on them had fluttered from the air. Frederick, sick of the wholebusiness, declined to comment. But many years later, in 1941, he broke silencein the Spiritualist newspaper Two Worlds, stating that slips of paper had fallenfrom the air, and that some of them contained writing made by tiny pinholes.(The Seeress of Prevorst also produced sheets of paper with geometrical drawingsmade by the same method.) One of these messages read: “I am having a bad timehere. I cannot rest. I was born during the reign of William the Conqueror.” Itwas signed “Tom Blood.” Other messages were signed “Jessie Blood.”The Battersea poltergeist seems to be in every way typical of the species.Whether or not it was genuinely an earthbound spirit from the days of Williamthe Conqueror must remain in doubt; poltergeists are not necessarily truthful.(But, as the Rochenberg-Rocha case shows, the dead have no sense of passingtime.) The chief mystery of the case is where it obtained the energy to continuethe “haunting” after the boy Peter left—for it seems reasonable to assume he wasthe “focus.” The answer may be provided by Price’s observation that at the backof the house there was a mental home. Price actually suggested that someex-servicemen patients in this home might have thrown lumps of coal (but this isprobably an example of his desire to be regarded as a hard-headed skeptic). Thementally disturbed are often the “focuses” of poltergeist activity, so it seemspossible that the “spirit” found a convenient reservoir of surplus energy justover the garden wall.The case with which Price’s name has become most widely associated is, ofcourse, that of Borley Rectory. And in spite of the “debunking” that has takenplace since Price’s death in 1948, it remains one of the most interestinghauntings of the twentieth century. After Price’s death, a whole volume of theProceedings of the Society for Psychical Research was devoted to “The Hauntingof Borley Rectory, A Critical Survey of the Evidence,” by Dingwall, Trevor Halland Kate Goldney. They allege that Price probably produced some of the“poltergeist” phenomena himself by tossing pebbles—which, from our knowledge ofPrice, must be admitted as possible. Their overall conclusion is that there areso many doubts that it would probably be simplest to regard the haunting ofBorley as a fairy story. But this is to ignore the fact that stories ofhauntings were common long before Price came on the scene, and have continuedsince he left it. Anyone who feels that the SPR survey proves that Price was aliar should read the long account of Borley in Peter Underwood’s Gazetteer ofBritish Ghosts, with Underwood’s own first-hand reports from interviews withwitnesses.Borley Rectory was built in 1863 on the site of Borley Manor House, which inturn seems to have been built on the site of a Benedictine abbey. It was builtby the Reverend H. D. E. Bull. It is difficult to pin down the earliest known“sightings,” but it is clear that during Henry Bull’s tenancy, a number ofpeople saw the apparition of a nun. Henry Bull himself knew of the legend that anun and a Benedictine monk had tried to elope, been caught, and had both beenkilled, the nun being bricked up alive. Bull’s daughter Ethel confirmed in aletter to Trevor Hall in 1953 that she had awakened to find a strange manstanding beside her bed, and had felt someone sitting down on the bed on severaloccasions; she also told Peter Underwood how, on July 28, 1900, she and her twosisters all saw a nun-like figure gliding along “Nun’s Walk,” apparently tellingher beads. The other sister, Elsie, saw the nun, who looked quite solid, andwent to ask her what she wanted; the nun vanished.After the Reverend Henry Bull’s death, his son, the Reverend Harry Bull, tookover the rectory. He was interested in psychical research, and claimed that hesaw many ghosts. His daughter told Price that he had seen a legendary phantomcoach (in which the lovers were supposed to have fled) and that, one day in thegarden, the retriever had howled with terror, looking toward some legs visibleunder a fruit tree. Bull, thinking this was a poacher, followed the legs as theywalked toward a postern gate; at which point he realized that the “poacher” wassomehow incomplete. The legs disappeared through the gate without opening it.Harry Bull died in 1927, and the rectory was empty until 1928, when the ReverendGuy Smith and his wife moved in.One stormy night, there was a furious ringing of the doorbell; when Smitharrived there, he found no one. It happened again later—a peal so prolonged thatSmith was able to get to the door before it stopped; again, there was no one.After that, all the keys of all the rooms fell out of the locks overnight;later, they vanished. Then they began hearing slippered footsteps. Stones werethrown—small pebbles. Lights were switched on. One day, Mrs. Smith thought shesaw a horse-drawn coach in the drive. Mr. Smith thought he heard someonewhisper, “Don’t, Carlos, don’t,” as he was walking into the chapel. The Smithsdecided to contact the Daily Mirror, who asked Harry Price if he would bewilling to go along with an investigator. They told Price their story, and gavehim every facility to investigate. But within nine months, they had had enoughof the place—perhaps because its plumbing left much to be desired—and moved toNorfolk. According to the SPR report, the Smiths only called the Daily Mirrorbecause they were concerned about all the stories that the house was haunted,and wanted to reassure their parishioners by getting the place a clean bill ofhealth. This story sounds, on the face of it, absurd. Moreover, there exists aletter from Mr. Smith to Harry Price stating: “Borley is undoubtedly haunted.”(It is true that Mrs. Smith wrote a letter to the Church Times in 1929, sayingshe did not believe the house to be haunted, but this seems to have been abelated attempt to stem the flood of sensational publicity that followed theDaily Mirror story.)In October 1930, the rectory was taken over by the Reverend L. A. Foyster, andhis much younger wife Marianne. Foyster, oddly enough, had lived near Amherst atthe time of the Esther Cox case, and the SPR survey makes much of thiscoincidence; however, it seems doubtful that the vicar would attempt to fakedisturbances on the model of his earlier experience. Certainly, the Foysterincumbency saw the most spectacular exhibitions of the Borley poltergeist.Foyster kept a diary of the disturbances. Bells were rung, bricks thrown,footsteps heard and water out of a jug poured over the couple when in bed.Foyster was even awakened by a violent blow on the head from his own hairbrush.They saw a number of apparitions, including the nun and a clergyman who wasidentified as the Reverend Henry Bull, the builder of the rectory. Writingappeared on the walls, asking for a mass to be said, and asking for “Light.”There is much independent confirmation of all these events. A Justice of thePeace named Guy L’Estrange visited Borley at the invitation of the Foysters, andwrote a lengthy account of it. As soon as he arrived, he saw a dim figure nearthe porch, which vanished as soon as he approached. Mrs. Foyster had a bruise onher forehead—something “like a man’s fist” had struck her the previous evening.The Foysters were telling L’Estrange about mysterious fires that kept breakingout in locked rooms when there was a loud crash in the hall; they found itlittered with broken crockery. Then bottles began flying about. L’Estrange notesthat they seemed to appear suddenly in mid-air. The bottles were coming from alocked storage shed outside. All the bells began to ring, making a deafeningclamor—but all the bell wires had been cut. L’Estrange shouted: “If someinvisible person is present, please stop ringing for a moment.” Instantly, thebells stopped—stopped dead, as if each clapper had been grabbed by an unseenhand. Later, sitting alone in front of the fire, L’Estrange heard footstepsbehind him; he turned, but the room was empty. The footsteps had come from apart of the wall where there had once been a door. In bed, L’Estrange felt theroom become icy cold, and saw a kind of shape materializing from a patch ofluminosity; he walked toward it, and had a feeling of something trying to pushhim back. He spoke to it, and it slowly vanished. He was luckier than anothervisitor who thought that the ghostly figure was someone playing a joke, andtried to grab it; he was given a hard blow in the eye.The rector and others tried praying in the chapel, taking with them a relic ofthe Curé of Ars, and then went around the house making signs of the cross.Finally, they all spent the night in the Blue Room, where Henry Bull (andothers) had died; they asked that the entity should stop troubling the inmatesof the house; a black shadow began to form against the wall, then dissolved. Butafter this, temporary peace descended on Borley Rectory.In 1935, the Foysters decided they had had enough, and moved. Price rented therectory in 1937, and arranged for a team of investigators to go in. But themajor phenomena were over. Even so, the chief investigator, Sidney Glanville, aretired engineer, became completely convinced of the reality of the haunting.In March 1938, the team were experimenting with a planchette, which wrote themessage that Borley would be destroyed by fire. This happened in February 1939,when the house mysteriously burned down. Yet the phenomena continued; aCambridge team investigating the ruins heard footsteps, saw patches of light,and recorded sudden sharp drops in temperature.In August 1943, Price decided to try digging in the cellars at Borley, which hehad been advised to do by a planchette message which claimed to come from“Glanville”—the same Glanville who wrote the account of the Tedworth drummer.They found a cream jug, which had also been referred to by the planchette, andsome fragments of a human skull. The jawbone showed signs of a deep-seatedabscess—Peter Underwood speculates that this is why the phantom nun alwayslooked miserable.The SPR survey on Borley, which appeared eight years after Price’s death, hadthe effect of seriously undermining his credit. Trevor Hall’s Search for HarryPrice (1978) completed the work of destroying his reputation. Yet although thisleaves no doubt that Price lied about his origins—perhaps romanced would be abetter word—and hungered for fame, it produces no evidence that Price was notexactly what he always claimed to be: an enthusiastic scientific investigator ofparanormal phenomena. To assume that, because Price wanted to be thought a“gentleman,” he was also dishonest as a paranormal researcher, is surely poorpsychology. Price was one of those ambitious men who crave an outlet for theirenergies. He was forty years old before he found the opportunity he was lookingfor—a long time for a man of Price’s impatient temperament. It came whenDingwall invited him to Munich to study the Schneider brothers. From then on,Price had discovered his vocation; at last, he had found the outlet he neededfor his explosive energy and romanticism. And when a man as energetic andromantic as Harry Price finally finds what he is looking for, he does not riskspoiling everything with a little cheap skulduggery. It only takes one scandalto destroy a scientist’s reputation. But to put it this way is to imply thatPrice disciplined his natural dishonesty solely to maintain his reputation andthis is to miss the real point; that once a man has found his vocation, he poursinto it all that is best about himself. Bernard Shaw has left an interestingdescription of the socialist Edward Aveling, who was Eleanor Marx’s common-lawhusband; he was an inveterate seducer, and a borrower who never paid his debts,yet where socialism was concerned, he was fiercely sincere. Everything we knowabout Price reveals that, where psychical research was concerned, he was totallydedicated—although not above grabbing publicity wherever he could find it.In short it would be of no advantage to him to pretend the Borley phenomena weregenuine when they were not. His reputation was based on his skepticism as muchas on his support of the reality of psychic phenomena. Possibly—like most ofus—he was capable of stretching a fact when it appealed to his romanticism. Butin the case of Borley, there was no need to stretch facts. The haunting ofBorley does not rest on Price’s evidence alone; there are dozens of otherwitnesses, such as Guy L’Estrange—or Dom Richard Whitehouse, cited by Underwood,who witnessed just as many incredible occurrences: flying objects, ringing ofbells, writing on walls, outbreaks of fire, materialization of bottles.And is there evidence that Price did stretch the facts? The SPR survey cites asan example of his dishonesty the episode of the pair of legs that Harry Bull sawwalking through the postern gate. Price says, admittedly, that when the manemerged from behind the fruit trees, he was headless. But the report then goeson to cite Price’s original notes, which read: “Rev. Harry Price saw coach,Juvenal, retriever, terrified and growled. Saw man’s legs rest hid by fruittrees, thought poacher, followed with Juvenal, gate shut, but saw legs disappearthrough gate.” Clearly, what Bull saw disappearing through the gate was not acomplete man, or Price would not refer only to the legs. It sounds as if theupper half of his body was missing—in which case, headless is a fairdescription.What seems clear from all accounts of the case is that the “ground” itself ishaunted, and continues to be so. Like Ardachie Lodge, Borley is a “place ofpower,” the kind of place that would be chosen for a monastery, and thatprobably held some pagan site of worship long before that. In the Rectory’searly days, Harry Bull himself—son of the Reverend Henry Bull—was probably theunconscious focus or medium; Paul Tabori says that he was probably psychic. Thisis borne out by the fact that young Bull saw so many of the “ghosts,” includingthe coach and the nun. It is important to realize that not all people can seeghosts. The “ghost hunter” Andrew Green describes, in Our Haunted Kingdom, avisit that he and other members of the Ealing Psychical Research Society paid toBorley in 1951.One of the Society members grabbed my arm and, although obviously terrified,proceeded to describe a phantom that he could see some thirty feet in front ofhim, standing at the end of the “Nun’s Walk.” It was of a Woman in a long whitegown, and moved slowly towards the end of the neglected garden . . . the witnesswas perspiring profusely with fear and later with annoyance that I had failed tosee the ghost.Green had only heard the rustle of trees and bushes, as if something was walkingthrough the undergrowth. We may assume, then, that if Green had been a tenant ofBorley before its destruction, he would probably have seen no ghosts. Bull was,it seems, enough of a “medium” to see the ghosts. And Marianne Foyster was a farmore powerful medium who changed the character of the haunting into poltergeistactivity. (Most of the messages scrawled on walls were addressed to her.) Thereason that the subsequent investigation of Borley (during Price’s tenancy) wasso unsuccessful was that there was no medium present to provide the energy.Asked about the “ley system” of the Borley area, the ley expert Stephen Jenkinsreplied as follows: “Norfolk and Suffolk are a spider-web of alignments, many ofwhich are linked to curious manifestations. Borley church stands at a node wherefour lines cross, one going from Asher church to Sproughton church . . .” Aftergiving further details of the ley system, he goes on:My wife photographed me as I was standing with my back to the south wall ofBorley churchyard, at ten o’clock on the morning of Saturday the 1st ofSeptember, 1979. Recently, this was borrowed for a magazine article, and theeditor kindly sent me an enlargement. No less than three people, not one of themknown to the others, have on separate occasions noted in the enlargement someodd—and not very prepossessing—faces among the trees close to the church. Thesame identifications have been made without possibility of collusion.More dramatic than unexpected faces in a photograph, which can always beexplained away as “simulacra,” or something wrong with the emulsion, is anincident of Sunday the 28th of August, 1977, on the road north of BelchampWalter Hall. The time was precisely 12:52 p.m., and we were driving southwestalong the minor road which marks the north end of the Hall grounds, when on theroad in front, in the act of turning left into the hedge (I mean our left,across the path of the car), instantaneously appeared four men in black—Ithought them hooded and cloaked—carrying a black, old-fashioned coffin, ornatelytrimmed with silver. The impression made on both of us was one of absolutephysical presence, of complete material reality. Thelma and I at once agreed tomake separate notes without comparing impressions. We did so, and thedescriptions tallied exactly, except that she noted the near left bearer turnhis face towards her. I did not see this as I was abruptly braking at the time.What I had seen as a hood, she described as a soft tall hat, with a kind ofscarf falling to the left shoulder, thrown across the cloaked body to the right.The face was that of a skull. . . .The next day we returned to the precise spot at exactly the same time and took apicture. It is a Kodak colour slide. In the hedge near the gap where the“funeral party” vanished (there is a path there leading to Belchamp Walterchurchyard) is a short figure, apparently cloaked, its face lowered with askull-like dome to the head. A year later I returned searching the area where ithad apparently stood. There was nothing, no post or stump that might haveprovided such an image, nor was there the slightest sign of the ground havingbeen disturbed by the removal of anything that might have been rooted in it. Theimage is simply there on the film—we saw nothing wrong with the eye.That minor road alongside the north edge of the Belchamp Walter Estate preciselycoincides with a line passing through the node in the water west of Heaven Wood.That node itself linked with the node at Borley.He adds a postscript: “I hazard a guess that the dress of the coffin-bearer isthat of the late fourteenth century. There seems to be no local legend of aphantom funeral.”If Price invented the ghosts of Borley, he must have been in collusion with aremarkable number of people.I did not like [Harry Price] because he was a difficult man to like. He wasintensely selfish, jealous, and intent on his own glory at all costs, but theseweaknesses of his character do not detract from his investigation as an honestinvestigator and ruthless exposer of frauds. This was the shining feature ofhis life.These words were written by another man who deserves to be remembered as one ofthe prominent ghost-hunters of the twentieth century. Unlike Price, Nandor Fodorseems to have had no great compulsion to achieve personal glory; the result isthat, since his death in 1964, his name has been largely forgotten, and most ofhis books are out of print. Yet at least one of his books—his account of theThornton Heath poltergeist case—deserves the status of a classic.Fodor was born in Hungary in 1895, studied law, then became a journalist, andvisited America. In 1926, he interviewed two remarkable men: HerewardCarrington, the psychical researcher, and Sandor Ferenczi, one of Freud’s mostprominent disciples. Fodor became simultaneously fascinated by psychoanalysisand psychical research and, in due course, became himself a psychoanalyst.Predictably, therefore, his analysis of poltergeist cases is dominated by theconviction that they have a sexual origin. But since—as we have seen—there is alarge element of truth in this view, Fodor’s psychoanalytical beliefs distortedhis outlook rather less than is often the case with Freudians.Fodor attended his first séance at the house of a well-known American medium,Arthur Ford, in October 1927 and what he heard there left him in no doubt thatthe dead can communicate. In the semi-darkness, a trumpet sailed up into theair, then a voice began to speak. Various relatives of people who were presentthen came and (apparently) talked through the medium. Fodor then asked if the“control” could bring someone who spoke Hungarian. It was, perhaps, anunreasonable request, but an excellent test for the medium. And after a fewmoments, a voice spoke from the air saying: “Fodor, journalist,” using theGerman pronunciation of the word—just as Fodor’s father did. Then the entityproceeded to speak to Fodor in Hungarian. The voice identified itself as Fodor’sfather, and mentioned various relatives; it named his oldest brother by his petname. The “spirit” was having great difficulty communicating because, explainedthe control, it was the first time he had tried to speak. The control helped outby telling Fodor that his father died on January 16. The “spirit” ended bysaying “Isten áldjon meg. Éides fiam”—“God bless you, my dear son.” After thisanother Hungarian came through—the deceased brother of Fodor’s wife, who waspresent. It mentioned that “poor Uncle Vilmos” was ill and would go blind. And,in due course, this is exactly what happened to Uncle Vilmos.It emerged later that the medium—a man called Cartheuser—could speak Hungarian.Yet this scarcely helps to explain his knowledge of Fodor’s father, and theprophecy about Uncle Vilmos. Cartheuser also had a speech impediment, due to ahare lip; the voices had no such impediment.Fodor came to England to work for Lord Northcliffe—owner of the Daily Mail—and,in his spare time, compiled an Encyclopedia of Psychic Science, which is stillone of the best available (a new edition combines it with a similar work byLewis Spence). After publishing the book, in 1934, Fodor had first-handexperience of the ambiguous nature of “psychic phenomena.” He heard of aremarkable Hungarian medium called Lajos Pap, a carpenter, whose specialty wascausing “apports” of live birds, animals and beetles to appear at séances. InJune 1933, Fodor attended such a séance in Budapest. Pap was undressed andsearched, then dressed again in a robe of luminous cloth, so that his movementsin the dark could be clearly seen. Two men held Pap’s wrists during the séance,although he could move his hands with their hands on him. In an hour-longséance, Pap groped into the air and produced thirty live beetles, many of theman inch long. He also produced a cactus plant with soil on the roots and a rosebush. On other occasions, Pap had produced birds, caterpillars, dragonflies,snakes, and a live goldfish. His “control,” the Rabbi Isaac (who claimed to havelived six hundred years earlier in Galicia) had a sense of humor. At one séance,a toy pistol arrived, and a number of explosive caps were fired; the Rabbiclaimed to have shot dead twenty-one crickets and, after the séance, deadcrickets were found in the room.On another occasion, nine lumps of dirty snow arrived during the séance, andproved to be mixed with horse manure and straw. The temperature in the room was72 degrees Fahrenheit, so it would have been difficult to keep the snow unmeltedfor long if it had been concealed under the medium’s robe.Fodor arranged for Lajos Pap to be brought to London. At a séance there a deadsnake, more than two feet long, appeared. Fodor was impressed; but henevertheless insisted that Pap should have an X-ray examination to find outwhether he could have anything secreted in his body. To Fodor’s surprise anddismay, Pap proved to be wearing a belt of linen and whalebone under his robe.He said it was a kind of rupture truss, because he had a dropped kidney; butFodor decided regretfully that this is where the dead snake had been hidden, andthat it had been worked out through the neck of the robe. Accordingly, in hissubsequent report, “The Lajos Pap Experiments,” Fodor concluded that Pap’spsychic powers should be regarded as “not proven.” Yet he adds:Nor would I be willing to declare him a fraud and nothing but a fraud. Too longhas psychical research been the victim of the fatal delusion that a medium iseither genuine or fraudulent. It is a minimal assumption that mediumship means adissociation of personality. There was plenty of evidence that Lajos Pap wassuffering from such a dissociation.In fact, Pap is still regarded as a non-fraudulent medium, and accounts of hisséances at which live birds and insects appeared seem to indicate that hispowers were remarkable.Fodor had been appointed Research Officer of the International Institute forPsychical Research. In November 1936, he was asked to investigate a case ofpoltergeist haunting at Aldborough Manor in Yorkshire. The bells for summoningservants had rung almost non-stop for five days, doors had opened and closed oftheir own accord, and two maids had seen a ghost above an ancient cradle. LadyLawson-Tancred, who lived in the house, was afraid she would have to move out ifthe haunting continued. But when Fodor arrived, it was already over. One of thetwo maids had had a nervous breakdown and left. The bells had rung during thenight she left and the following morning, then stopped. To Fodor, therefore, itwas clear that the maid was the “focus” of the disturbance. Her nervousbreakdown was probably caused by the “drain” upon her energies caused by thepoltergeist. The other maid, a very pretty girl, also had a strange power overanimals; birds would settle on her shoulders, and mice run into her hands. LadyLawson-Tancred thought that she might also be connected with the disturbances,and dismissed her. (Fodor seems to have explained to her the difference betweena poltergeist and a real “haunting,” where the house itself seems to concentratethe negative forces, as at Borley.) After this, Aldborough Manor becamepeaceful.The same solution was found in the case of a Chelsea poltergeist that disturbeda house with its knockings. Fodor went to the house, in Elm Park Gardens, andheard the rappings himself—he said they were like hammer blows. Fodor lookedaround for the focus, and soon found it: a seventeen-year-old servant girl namedFlorrie. He engaged her in conversation, and she told him that this was not herfirst experience of mysterious knockings—the same thing had happened at homefour years before, when she was thirteen. The children were all sent away, andwhen they returned, the knocking had stopped. Clearly, Florrie was quite unawarethat she had been the “cause” of the knockings.Fodor told the house’s owner, Dr. Aidan Redmond, that Florrie was probably theunconscious medium. That night, the raps were like machine-gun fire. Dr. Redmond regretfully sacked Florrie. And silence descended on thehouse.In July 1936, Fodor investigated a case in which the distinction between ghostand poltergeist becomes blurred; this was at Ash Manor, in Sussex, and hedisguises the family under the name of Keel. It is among the most remarkableghost stories ever recorded.The house was bought by the family in June 1934; when they said they could notpay the price demanded, the owner dropped his demand so surprisingly that theKeels decided there must be something wrong with the place, probably thesanitation. But the wife soon began to get extremely unpleasant feelings in abedroom that had been used for servants. (The previous owner said they had runaway.)The first manifestations were stamping noises from the attic. But this room hadno floorboards—only the bare joists. In November 1934, Mr. Keel was awakened bythree violent bangs on his door. He went to his wife’s room down thecorridor—she had also heard them. This happened at 3 a.m. The next night, therewere two thumps on the door at the same time, and the following night, one loudthump. Keel went away on business for a few days, and when he returned, decidedto stay awake until 3 a.m. to see if anything happened. Nothing did, and he fellasleep. Then a violent bang woke him up. Although the room was dark, he couldsee quite clearly a small, oldish man dressed in a green smock, with muddybreeches and a handkerchief around his neck. He looked so solid and normal thatKeel was convinced this was an intruder and, when he got no reply, jumped out ofbed and tried to grab him: His hand went through him, and Keel fainted. When hecame to, he ran to his wife’s bedroom, babbling incoherently, and his wiferushed out to get some brandy. Outside her husband’s room she saw the feet andleggings of a man, then looked up and saw the same little old man. She was alsoable to see him quite clearly in the dark, although he did not seem to beshining. She observed that he was wearing a pudding basin hat, that his face wasvery red, “the eyes malevolent and horrid,” and that his mouth was dribbling.She also asked him who he was and what he wanted. When he made no reply, shetried to hit him. Her fist went through him, and she hurt her knuckles on thedoorpost. Her husband was in a faint in her room at the time, so he had not hadan opportunity to describe the man he saw; it was only later that they realizedboth had seen the same ghost.After this, they continued to see the little old man in green several times aweek. They also heard footsteps and knocking. The old man usually walked acrossKeel’s bedroom, appearing from the chimney on the landing, and vanished into acupboard which had once been a priest hole. After a while, the family ceased tobe afraid of him. The wife discovered that she could make him vanish byextending a finger and trying to touch him. The third time she saw him, the oldman raised his head, and Mrs. Keel could see that his throat was cut and hiswindpipe was sticking out. One day she heard heavy footsteps approaching alongthe corridor, and thought it was her husband. Her bedroom door, which waslocked, flew open and invisible footsteps crashed across the room (although thefloor was carpeted), then the footsteps went upward toward the ceiling, as ifthey were mounting a staircase. A trapdoor in the ceiling flew open, and thefootsteps continued in the attic—again, sounding as if they were on floorboards,although these had been removed. A dog in the room was terrified. Mrs. Keel’ssixteen-year-old daughter Pat was sleeping in her mother’s room, and witnessedthe whole episode. The man who sold them the house told them that there had beena staircase in the room, which he had had removed to replace it with thefireplace.Two psychical investigators who were called in declared that the house had beenbuilt on the site of a Druid stone circle, and that this explained why it washaunted. The ghost, they said, was a man called Henry Knowles, who had cut histhroat in 1819 when a milkmaid had jilted him.As the Research Officer for the International Institute, Fodor was called in toinvestigate; he had with him Mrs. Maude ffoulkes, who also published the storyof the manor house in her book, True Ghost Stories, later that year (thusproviding independent corroboration of the story). An amateur photographer hadsucceeded in taking a picture of a dim shape on the haunted landing, so Fodortook his own photographic equipment.Fodor now had enough experience of hauntings to look for unhappiness in thehouse. The daughter, Pat, struck him as nervous and very jealous of anyattention given to her mother, and admitted to suffering from temper tantrums.On the first night, nothing happened. The next time, Fodor slept in the “hauntedroom,” but, apart from awful nightmares, had nothing to record. He decided toask the help of the famous American medium, Eileen Garrett, who happened to bein England. In late July Mrs. Garrett came to the house and immediately hadstrong psychic impressions. The ghost, she said, was a man who had beenimprisoned nearby. There had been a king’s palace nearby, and the man had beentortured. He had something to do with a king called Edward. Her furtherobservations suggested that the “ghost” she saw was not the same old man, forshe described him as sharp-featured, with blond hair, and said he had taken partin a rebellion against his half-brother, the king. (In fact, there were tworoyal castles in the area, Farnham and Guildford.)Mrs. Garrett went into a trance, and was taken over by her trance personality,Uvani, an Arabian. Uvani made the interesting comment that hauntings take placeonly when there is someone in a “bad emotional state” who can revivify oldunhappy memories. There were bad emotional states in this house, said Uvani.“Life cannot die,” said Uvani, “you can explode its dynamism, but you cannotdissipate its energy. If you suffered where life suffered, the essence that oncefilled the frame will take from you something to dramatize and live again.”About five hundred yards to the west of this house, said Uvani, there had been ajail in the early part of the fifteenth century, and many unfortunate men andwomen had died there. “There are dozens of unhappy souls about.” (The earlyfifteenth century was the period of the battle of Agincourt, Joan of Arc, andmany revolts and rebellions. The plot against Edward the Fourth by his brother,the Duke of Clarence, was in 1470.)“According to this,” says Fodor,[2] “our ghost was a spectral automaton, livingon life borrowed from human wrecks—a fascinating conception which was verydifferent from ordinary spiritualistic conceptions and very damning for theowners of the house.Uvani then said that he would allow the ghost to take possession of Mrs.Garrett’s body. The medium grew stiff and her breathing became labored. Sheseemed to be trying to speak, but was unable. The “spirit” pointed to its lips,tapped them as if to signal it was dumb, then felt its throat gingerly. Hebeckoned to Fodor, then seized his hand in such a powerful grip that Fodorhowled with pain. Although another person present tried to help him free hishand, it was impossible. Fodor’s hand went numb, and was useless for days afterthe séance.The “man” threw himself on his knees in front of Fodor, seemed to be pleading,and clicked his tongue as if trying to speak. Then it called “Eleison, eleison,”pleading for mercy in the words of the mass. Aware that the ghost was taking himfor its jailer, Fodor tried to reassure it, and said they were trying to helphim. Finally, the man seemed reassured, and sat down. He began to speak in anodd, medieval English (unfortunately, tape recorders did not exist in thosedays—it would have been fascinating to have an authentic example of the Englishof Chaucer’s period), and spoke about the Earl of Huntingdon, calling himungrateful. It asked Fodor to help him find his wife, then raged about the Dukeof Buckingham, (perhaps the one who led a rebellion against Richard III in thelate fifteenth century). It seemed that the Duke of Buckingham had offered theman “broad acres and ducats” in exchange for his wife, then betrayed him. Thespirit identified itself as Charles Edward Henley, son of Lord Henley. On asheet of paper, it wrote its name, then “Lord Huntingdon,” and the word “Esse,”which was the medieval name for the village near the manor house. It made thecurious statement that Buckingham, the friend of his childhood, had “forced hereyes,” “her” being his wife Dorothy. He added: “Malgré her father lies buried inEsse,” and went on: “You being friend, you proved yourself a brother, do notleave me, but help me to attain my vengeance.”Remembering that, according to the teachings of Spiritualism, it is remorse ordesire for vengeance that often keeps spirits bound to earth, Fodor and anothersitter, a Dr. Lindsay, tried hard to persuade the spirit to abandon its hatred.Finally, it seemed to agree, then cried out, “Hold me, hold me, I cannot stay, Iam slipping . . .” Then it was gone, and Mrs. Garrett woke up.During this séance, the Keels had been present. Mrs. Keel peered closely at themedium’s face while “Henley” was speaking through her, and was horrified to seethat it now looked like the old man she had seen.But had the ghost been laid? Apparently not. Some time later, Keel rang Fodor totell him that the old man was back again, standing in the doorway and trying tospeak.Dr. Lindsay, who had been present at the séance, had also had a remarkableexperience. At the College of Psychic Science, he had been involved in a séancewith another medium when the ghost of “Henley” came through. It complained thatFodor had promised to stand by him, but that when he had come back the followingnight, there was no one there. The old man said he had seen his son, for whom hehad been searching, but not his wife.They had another session with Mrs. Garrett that afternoon. Again, the ghost camethrough, and made more pleas for help, as well as saying a little more about hisbackground. It was not particularly informative; but the control, Uvani, hadsome interesting things to say. He asserted that the Keels had been “using” theghost to “embarrass” each other. What was being suggested was that theghost-laying ceremony would have worked if the Keels had not wanted to cling onto the ghost as a device for somehow “getting at” one another.Following this hint, Fodor talked to Mrs. Keel. She then admitted that Uvani wasright about the unhappiness in the household. Her husband was homosexual, sotheir sex lives left much to be desired. And the daughter was jealous of hermother—Fodor hints that it was a classic Oedipus complex. Mrs. Keel was keepingup her spirits with drugs.Soon after this, the case began to reach a kind of climax. Mr. Keel himself wasbecoming “possessed” by the spirit, talking in his sleep and saying things about“Henley” and his life. Fodor sent him a transcription of the things Uvani hadsaid about the desire of the Keels to “hold on” to the ghost; as a result, Keelrang him to admit he felt it was true.This confession had the effect that Fodor’s “ghost-laying ceremony” had failedto achieve; the ghost of Ash Manor disappeared and did not return.This is undoubtedly one of the most interesting cases of haunting on record, fora number of reasons. First, the corroboration is impressive: the story was alsowritten up by Maude ffoulkes and published in 1936,[3] and the participation ofEileen Garrett rules out any suggestion that Fodor might simply have inventedthe whole story—a suggestion that has been made about one of Harry Price’s mostimpressive cases, “Rosalie.”[4] Second, the behavior of the ghost seems to showthat the “tape recording” theory of Lethbridge and Sir Oliver Lodge does notcover all hauntings; “Henley” was clearly more than a “recording.” And third, itdemonstrates very clearly that there is no clear dividing line between a ghostand a poltergeist. This case started with bangings and rappings, and thendeveloped into a haunting. And, if we can accept Uvani’s statements as any kindof evidence, it also suggests that there are such things as “earth-bound”spirits, probably in dismaying abundance. The other implications—about thenature of such spirits—must be left until the final chapter.If Fodor had possessed Price’s flair for publicity, the “Henley” case might havemade him as famous as Borley made Price. But he made no attempt to publicize it.Neither did he attempt to make capital out of a visit to study the talkingmongoose of Cashen’s Gap (except for a single chapter in a book), although hisinvestigation was rather more painstaking—if hardly more successful—thanPrice’s. (Fodor concluded that the mongoose was probably genuine, but deniedthat it was a poltergeist on the dubious grounds that poltergeists are alwaysinvisible; we have seen that “elementals” are rather less easy to classify thanthis implies.) In fact, Fodor’s only flash of notoriety occurred almostaccidentally as a result of a libel action he brought against Psychic News. Hewas asked whether it was true that he wanted to take a medium, Mrs. Fielding, tothe Tower of London to steal the Crown Jewels by psychic means, and he admittedthat this was true, and that he had been willing to go to prison if theexperiment had been successful. However, it had been forbidden by the othermembers of the International Institute. From then on, Fodor was known as the manwho wanted to “spirit away” the Crown Jewels.Mrs. Fielding was, in fact, the “focus” of the most interesting and complexpoltergeist case he ever investigated. Mrs. Fielding (Fodor calls her Mrs.Forbes in his book On the Trail of the Poltergeist) was a thirty-five-year-oldLondon housewife, living at Thornton Heath, an attractive woman with aseventeen-year-old son. The disturbances began on Friday, February 19, 1938, asthe Fieldings were in bed, and on the point of sleep. A glass shattered on thefloor, and when they put on the light, another glass flew past their heads. Theyput off the light, and the eiderdown flew up in their faces. They tried toswitch on the light again, but the bulb had been removed. A pot of face creamwas thrown at their son when he came in to see what was happening. The next day,cups, saucers and ornaments flew through the air. They notified the SundayPictorial, and two reporters came. The poltergeist obliged with an impressivedisplay. A cup and saucer in Mrs. Fielding’s hand shattered and cut her badly, ahuge piece of coal struck the wall with such force that it left a big hole, anegg cup shattered in the hand of one reporter, and Mrs. Fielding was thrown outof her chair by some force. As Mr. Fielding went upstairs, a vase flew throughthe air and struck him with a crash—yet although he looked dazed, his head wasnot bruised. Within three days of the coming of the poltergeist, it had brokenthirty-six tumblers, twenty-four wine glasses, fifteen egg cups and a long listof other articles.When Fodor arrived a few days later, the poltergeist did not disappoint. Fodorrecords twenty-nine poltergeist incidents during that first visit. Again andagain, he had his eyes on Mrs. Fielding when things happened—glasses flew offtables, a saucer smashed against the wall, glasses were snatched from her handsand broke on the floor. It was soon clear that Mrs. Fielding, and not herseventeen-year-old son, was the focus and “cause” of the disturbances. One glassflew out of her hand and split in mid-air with a loud ping, as if it had beenhit by a hammer.Fodor asked Mrs. Fielding to come to the headquarters of the Institute, WaltonHouse, for tests. She was dressed in a one-piece garment after being searched (aprecaution he may have learned from the Lajos Pap case) and they went into theséance room. While Mrs. Fielding was standing in full view, with three witnessesaround her, there was a clatter, and a brass-bound hair brush appeared on thefloor. It was warm, as “apports” usually are (the theory being that they are“dematerialized” and then re-materialized). Mrs. Fielding identified it as herown, and said she had left it in her bedroom at home. The poltergeist thenobliged with several more apports, and also made saucers fly out of Mrs.Fielding’s hands and split with a ping in mid-air. Strong men found that theycould not break them in their hands.The idea of stealing the Crown Jewels probably came to Fodor when he and Mrs.Fielding went into a gift shop and she decided against buying a small elephant;as they were getting into the car, a box in Mrs. Fielding’s hand rattled, andthey found the elephant in it; they had committed “psychic shop-lifting.”At a later “sitting,” Mrs. Fielding produced some impressive results. On oneoccasion she sat with her hands tightly clenched while someone held them. Theperson holding them felt one hand convulse “as if something was being born,” andwhen Mrs. Fielding opened her hand, there was a tortoiseshell cross in it.She also began to experience “psychic projections,” finding herself in otherplaces in her trance states. In the séance room, in a semi-trance, she projectedherself back to her home. They telephoned her husband, who said she was there,and even handed her the telephone; at that moment, they were cut off. Mrs.Fielding’s “double” handed her husband a recipe that she had written in theséance room; he read it back to them over the telephone, and it was identicalwith the one they had in front of them. He also handed the “double” a compass,which then reappeared in the séance room, ten miles away. The “double” hadwalked out of the front door with the compass.A full account of Mrs. Fielding’s phenomena would occupy a whole chapter. Sheproduced some ancient artifacts like Roman lamps and pottery labeled “Carthage,”white mice and a bird, and a spray of violet perfume around her body (as well asviolets which fell from the air.) Under increasing strain, she started to showsigns of breakdown. She began going hysterically blind, burn marks appeared onher neck, and she claimed she was being clawed by an invisible tiger (producingan unpleasant “zoo” odor). When her husband said jokingly that he would like anelephant, there was a crash and an elephant’s tooth appeared in the hall. Shealso had a phantom pregnancy.At a séance, a spirit that claimed to be her grandfather declared that he wasresponsible for the apports. Asked to prove its identity by bringing somethingof its own, it materialized a silver matchbox—which Mrs. Fielding said hadbelonged to her grandfather—in her clasped hands.And at this point, the story took a bewildering turn. Mrs. Forbes [Fielding]apparently began cheating. Fodor saw her producing a “breeze” during a séance byblowing on the back of someone’s neck. Fodor became convinced that she wasproducing small “apports” from under her clothes, and an X-ray photograph showeda brooch hidden beneath her left breast. Later, she produced this brooch as anapport. When being undressed, a small square of linen fell from between herlegs, stained with vaginal secretion; it looked as if she was also using hervagina to hide apports.Two days after this, she claimed to have been attacked by a vampire. There weretwo small puncture marks on her neck, and she looked listless and pale.One of the oddest incidents occurred when Fodor was walking with her into theInstitute. With no attempt at concealment, she opened her handbag, tooksomething out, and threw a stone over her shoulder. When Fodor asked her aboutthis, she indignantly denied it.In his account of the case in The Haunted Mind, Fodor makes the statement: “Thisdiscovery eliminated any remaining suspicion that a spirit or psychic force wasstill at work.” But the “still” implies that he felt there had been genuinepsychic forces at work at an earlier stage. Reading his full account of thecase, this seems self-evident. It would have been impossible for Mrs. Fieldingto have faked the poltergeist occurrences in her home, and later in theInstitute.Fodor’s own analysis is as follows:As a child, Mrs. Fielding was both accident- and illness-prone. At the age ofsix, recovering from tonsillitis, she thought that a muscular black arm tried tostrangle her in bed; it vanished when her mother ran in. She was bitten by a maddog, and attacked (and scarred) by a parrot. She lived in a house with areputation for being haunted, and Fodor states as a fact that neither thewindows nor mirrors ever needed cleaning—they were cleaned by invisible handsduring the night.At sixteen, she had “visions” of a ghost; a cupboard in her room opened and aman stepped out, then vanished. Subsequently she saw him several times. On oneoccasion he left a piece of paper with sooty scrawls on it beside her, but hermother burned it. A bicycle accident at this time led to a kidney abscess, whichlater necessitated many operations. At seventeen she made a runaway marriage,had her first baby at eighteen, her second at twenty-one. (This died ofmeningitis.) At twenty she contracted anthrax poisoning, and tried to stab herhusband with a carving knife. She ran into the street in her nightdressscreaming “Murder, fire,” and recovered after having twenty-eight teethextracted.At twenty-four she had a vision of her father, trying to pull her away from herhusband. He made the sign of the cross over her left breast. When she woke fromher trance, this was bleeding. At the hospital they discovered she had a breastcancer, and the breast was amputated. At twenty-six she had an attack ofhysterical blindness which lasted for six weeks and, at twenty-seven, was in anaccident on a steamer which was smashed against Margate pier. At twenty-eightshe aborted twins after being terrified when she found a dead rat in among herwashing. At thirty she had a kidney operation, and at thirty-two, pleurisy.Altogether, it can be seen, Mrs. Fielding was a thoroughly unlucky woman.Fodor then proceeds to interpret the evidence from the Freudian point of view.He is convinced that the basic truth is that Mrs. Fielding was attacked andraped, probably in a churchyard, by a man in round glasses, before she was fiveyears old. Everything else, he thinks springs from this trauma. On twooccasions, when lying awake at night, she felt a shape like a man—but as cold asa corpse—get into bed with her; then it “behaved like a man” (i.e., had sexualintercourse). One day, on her way to the Institute, Mrs. Fielding was attackedby a man on the train. Fodor does not doubt that she was attacked—she arrived inan upset condition—but thinks that the man’s round glasses may have aroused inher a mixture of loathing and desire which was wrongly interpreted by the man asan invitation. Fodor goes on to suggest that her husband became somehowidentified in her mind with her attacker, so that the poltergeist attacks weredue to her unconscious aggressions against him.There are times when Fodor’s Freudian interpretations verge on the comic. Forexample, he is convinced that her apports are a cipher “in which her tragic lifestory is hidden.” On one evening, the apports were: elephant’s tooth, tigerclaw, Carthage pottery, a tropical nutshell and a piece of coral. These, saysFodor, symbolize the hugeness of the man who assaulted her (an elephant), hissavagery and beastliness, his scaliness (the nutshell), while the potterysymbolizes the breaking of her hymen. The coral stands for music from the churchnearby. (Organ music always made Mrs. Fielding cry, and Fodor surmises that thecoral was organ-pipe coral.)There is, of course, one basic objection to the whole theory. Mrs. Fielding didnot tell Fodor she had been raped, and apparently had no such memory. Fodornaturally thinks it was suppressed. But do memories of that type become sosuppressed that they vanish completely? It seems highly unlikely.Fodor was never able to bring the case to a satisfactory conclusion. When hebegan explaining his rape theories to the Institute for Psychical Research, theyobjected so strongly that he felt obliged to drop the case. At least it enabledhim to believe that Mrs. Fielding was getting closer and closer to rememberingher rape experience, and would one day have confirmed all his theories. It willbe recalled that, in the case of the Bell Witch, Fodor believed that Betsy hadbeen sexually attacked by her father, and that this produced the poltergeist,“tearing loose part of the mental system and letting it float free like adisembodied entity.” As a good Freudian, he felt bound to seek a sexualexplanation in the Thornton Heath case. Yet, like so many of the “primal scenes”that Freud believed caused lifelong illness, the one posited by Fodor iscompletely inverifiable.It would be a pity to leave this case without at least an attempt at analternative explanation. And the simplest and most obvious is that Mrs. Fieldingwas a born medium. Her many illnesses turned her into what nineteenth-centuryinvestigators liked to call a “sick sensitive.” Her vision of the black arm thattried to strangle her in bed may not have been a dream or hallucination, asFodor thinks. If she lived in a haunted house, then it seems likely that spiritentities drew energy from her, increasing her tendency to illness. And later inlife, she actually developed into a medium. During the investigation, she oftenwent into trances, and a “control” called Bremba spoke through her. Sitting neara pub—and a church—in Coulsdon, she had a vision of an evil, leering face, whichshe continued to see for ten minutes. “Bremba” later stated at a séance that theman she saw had belonged to the church, and had been hanged for interfering withsmall children. “She was probably sitting on the spot where one of the outragestook place.” When Mrs. Fielding came out of her trance, she could not speak oreven whisper, then, as they all watched, strangulation marks appeared on herthroat. When she could speak she said: “I feel as if I am being pulled up”—as ifshe was suffering from the man’s hanging. Later, when she was telling friendsabout it, the noose marks again appeared on her throat. Fodor uses this as asupport for his theory about the early rape; but it could, in fact be ordinarymediumship. Bremba could have been telling the truth about the man hanged forsexual offenses against children.Then why did Mrs. Fielding begin to cheat? There are two possible explanations.One is that she was enjoying her new position as a subject of investigation. Shewas a bored housewife, and, as Fodor says, the phenomena meant “a new interest,a new life for her.” This could be true; but if Mrs. Fielding was developinggenuine powers as a medium, then she had no need to cheat in order to keep them.It sounds as if they had been latent since childhood; all she had to do was toallow them to develop.The other explanation is that she was unconscious that she was cheating—whichwould explain the stone thrown in front of Fodor, with no attempt atconcealment, and her subsequent denial. I have mentioned the case cited by Rollin which a man being investigated was seen, through a two way mirror, to throwan object—yet a lie detector test supported his denial that he had done it. Wehave seen that there is considerable evidence that poltergeists can enter themind and influence people-mediums more than others.To anyone who reads straight through Fodor’s On the Trail of the Poltergeist, itseems obvious that Guy Playfair’s “spirit entity” theory fits better than most.Both the Fieldings had been ill for some time before the first outbreak. So Mrs.Fielding may have been in a suitably “low” condition to enable the entity tobegin using her energy. From then on, it used her continually, and accordinglyshe began to suffer from nervous exhaustion. Yet her attitude toward all thismust have been ambiguous, for it brought new interest into her life; this couldhave enabled the entity—or entities—to manipulate her to cheat. And why shouldthey? Because, for some reason, poltergeists seem to delight in producingbewilderment and confusion.The one point that emerges above all others is that Mrs. Fielding was not justthe focus of the poltergeist disturbances; she was a medium, and soon began todevelop her ability, with apports, travelling clairvoyance, projection of the“double,” and so on. In short, Mrs. Fielding was a potential Daniel Dunglas Homeor Eusapia Palladino. And this, it seems probable, is true for all the peoplewho became “focuses” for poltergeist phenomena. With her illnesses, her earlymarriage, even the loss of her teeth, Mrs. Fielding calls to mind anothermedium, the “Seeress of Prevorst,” whose history forms the starting point ofthis chapter. Nandor Fodor, like Justinus Kerner, was a medical man. Yet itcannot be said that his study of Mrs. Fielding is as penetrating or assuggestive as Kerner’s study of Friederike Hauffe. To read On the Trail of thePoltergeist after The Seeress of Prevorst is a depressing experience. It is torealize that a century of psychical research has brought very few advances—that,on the contrary, an unimaginative and over-cautious approach to the phenomenahas only made them less comprehensible than ever.[1].

Earlier that year the Panther had kidnapped an heiress named LesleyWhittle, and in March her body had been found down an underground tunnel inBathpool Park, near Kidsgrove. The Panther was also wanted for a number ofburglaries in post offices, during which he had killed three sub-postmasters.So, in October 1975, he was the most wanted criminal in England. Understandably,I was intrigued by the letter claiming to know his identity.It had come from a village not far from St. Ives, in Cornwall, and on October16, 1975, I drove down to see the writer, taking with me a guest who happened tobe staying with us. En route, we called in to see Dora Russell, widow ofBertrand Russell, with the result that we arrived at the village in the lateafternoon.The writer of the letter was the village postman, and he was young, bearded, andhad an appearance of sturdy common sense. It was his wife, he explained, who waspsychic, and who had discovered the Panther’s identity. His wife was a slim,pale girl who looked distinctly “delicate.” Their cottage was freezing—heexplained that it had to be kept at that temperature to prevent his wife frombecoming feverish.During the next hour, the two of them told us an incredible story. But theybegan by asking us if we could stay until eight o’clock. We asked why. “Becausethat’s when the knockings begin.” Every evening, they said, at eight o’clocksome entity beat a regular tattoo on their bedroom wall. It sometimes made sucha racket that it sounded like the drums of the Scots Guards. This had now beengoing on for several months. They were disappointed when we said that we had tobe back in St. Austell by eight o’clock to take some friends out to dinner.The story had begun a few months earlier, when his wife had had a series ofvivid dreams and trance communications. She was Irish, and apparently this kindof thing had been happening all her adult life. Then, one evening, the rappingnoises had started on their bedroom wall. It was clearly a “spirit,” so theytried to communicate with it by the usual code, one rap for yes, two for no.They learned it was a girl, that she was recently dead, and that she had beenmurdered. Lesley Whittle’s body had only recently been found in Bathpool Park,and when asked: “Are you Lesley Whittle?” the entity set a tremendous triumphanttattoo, as if to say “You’ve got it.”Odd coincidences began to occur, obviously engineered by the “spirit.” The wifehad a number of vivid dreams or visions of a certain set of park gates with aninscription on them. Her husband happened to open a Reader’s Digest Guide toBritain, and saw gates that sounded like the description; his wife instantlyrecognized them. The entity told them by means of raps that the Black Pantherhad buried his gun under a stone in this park, and the wife saw the spot—in avision—so clearly that she was able to make a sketch map of the whereabouts ofthe stone. Her husband finally rang the police who were hunting the Panther,and, after some difficulty, persuaded them to go to the park and look underneaththe stone. Astonishingly, the stone was there, and the description of theimmediate vicinity proved to be accurate; but a metal detector found nothingunder the stone . . .They had tried ringing the post office in the village near the park, and hadconcluded that the people who ran it knew the identity of the Panther, and wereshielding him. They had made the mistake of giving their own telephone number.And now, they were absolutely convinced, the Panther was “on to them.” A strangecar had been parked in the lay-by opposite their house for night after night inAugust, with a gypsy-like man and woman in it, and someone had prowled aroundtheir house trying to break in . . . The car had followed them around, but onone occasion, when they pulled into a beach car park, and the other car turnedin a few minutes later, a police car happened to enter the car park, whereuponthe other car drove off “like a bat out of hell.”Their story was extremely long, extremely circumstantial. The “spirit of LesleyWhittle” had told them that the Panther had escaped through the undergroundtunnel in a boat, and gone straight to the park, where he hid his gun under thestone. He lived in a caravan in the garden of a cottage. When I asked the nameof the Panther, they gave it without hesitation: it was W. E. Jones, and hiscaravan was in the village of Baynhall, Worcestershire.As my guest and I drove away, at about seven o’clock (frozen to the bone), weagreed that it had been an impressive story, and that the husband seemedcompletely balanced and down to earth, even if the wife seemed a little “fey.”Accordingly, the next morning, I sat down and dictated a long letter to theCommissioner of Police, Sir Robert Mark, with whom I was acquainted. I told himI agreed it all sounded preposterous, but that the couple struck me as genuine,and it was surely worth checking up on the stone in the park—digging, instead ofusing a metal detector—and on Mr. W. E. Jones—if he existed—of Baynhall,Worcestershire. He wrote back, promising to pass it all on to the officer incharge of the case. And, a couple of weeks later, he wrote again to say thatboth the stone, and Mr. Jones of Baynhall, had proved negative.On December 11, 1975, two policemen at Mansfield Woodhouse saw a man carrying ahold-all, and stopped their police car to ask a few routine questions; hepointed a shotgun at them, climbed into the car and made them drive on. One ofthe policemen tackled him; two men in a fish and chip queue joined in, and theman was handcuffed to the railings. Two “Panther” hoods in his bag revealed thathe was the man the police had been looking for. And when the news of his arrestwas broadcast on the television news, I crossed my fingers that this name wouldturn out to be Jones. It was not. It was Donald Nielsen, and he lived inBradford, not Baynhall. In due course, he was sentenced to life imprisonment forthe murder of Lesley Whittle and three postmasters.Oddly enough, the psychic and her husband refused to accept that theirpoltergeist had been mistaken, and wrote to me asking if I could find outwhether Donald Nielsen had paid a visit to Cornwall during August 1975. Ichecked with the police officer in charge of the case, and was told that he waspretty certain Nielsen had not been that far south. The couple declined tobelieve it. They had found the “communications” circumstantial and convincing.My own conclusion was that the “spirit” had simply been a circumstantial andconvincing liar.While I was still collecting material on poltergeists, I was asked if I wouldwrite the text of an illustrated book about witchcraft; and since it was asubject on which I have written a great deal—and which would therefore require aminimum of research—I agreed. It proved to be an excellent preparation forwriting a book about poltergeists. It is possible to believe you know a subjectfairly thoroughly, and then to discover, as you write about it, that you haveoverlooked its very essence. And as I plunged into the history of witchcraft, itstruck me that not only had I failed to understand it, but that thetwentieth-century mind had lost the key to the whole phenomenon. This applies asmuch to modern witches and “occultists” as to scientists and skeptics. When welook into a work like Francis Barrett’s The Magus (1801), with its pictures ofthe heads of demons, we feel a kind of irritation that anyone could have been sostupid as to take them seriously. We can accept the idea of the strange powersof the unconscious mind, even of psychokinesis; but the assumptions that haveformed the basis of witchcraft for the past three or four thousand years strikeus as absurd superstitions. Margaret Murray convinced a whole generation thatwitchcraft was an ancient pagan religion called wicca, which was basically aform of nature worship, the cult of the Moon Goddess and the Earth Mother, andthat the witches who were burned at the stake were simply carrying on the oldpractices. As far as she went, she was probably correct. But Margaret Murray wasa modern rationalist, for whom “magic” was an absurdity. And all witchcraft hasbeen based on the idea of magic: that the witch or magician can make use ofspirit entities to carry out her will. (These are known as “familiars.”)The earliest literary record of a witch is the story of the witch of Endor inthe Bible, and it makes clear that the chief business of a witch in those days(about 1000 B.C.) was raising the dead. And later tales of witches—in Horace,Apuleius and Lucan—make it clear that this was still true a thousand years lateron. After the beginning of the Christian era (whose own major contribution wasthe idea of the Devil), the witch also became the invoker of demons. The mostfamous picture of John Dee, the Elizabethan magician, shows him in a graveyardwith the spirit of a dead man he has just raised. “Necromancy”—the raising ofthe dead—was a synonym for magic. We may infer, therefore, that although theancients knew nothing about Spiritualism, they had stumbled upon the samediscovery as the Fox sisters and Daniel Dunglas Home: that it is, apparently,possible to communicate with the “dead,” as well as with other invisibleentities. In his notorious History of Witchcraft, the Reverend Montague Summersdenounces modern Spiritualism as a revival of witchcraft. He may simply havemeant to be uncomplimentary about Spiritualism; but, as it happens, he washistorically correct. The kind of Spiritualism initiated by the Fox sisters wasthe nearest approach to what Lucan’s Erichtho, or Dame Alice Kyteler, would haveunderstood by witchcraft. It begins and ends with the idea that we aresurrounded by invisible spirits, including those of the dead, and that these canbe used for magical purposes. Accordingly, magicians like Paracelsus, CorneliusAgrippa and John Dee took care to protect themselves in magic circles—orpentagrams—when they conjured “demons,” and to perform the rituals with pedanticexactitude (which, according to Guy Playfair, is essential, the spirits beingsticklers for detail).Some cases, like that of Isobel Gowdie and the Auldearne witches, areincomprehensible unless we recognize that witchcraft is about “spirits”—the kindof spirits we have been discussing in this book. In 1662, Isobel Gowdie, anattractive, red-headed farmer’s wife, shocked the elders of the local kirk (inMorayshire, Scotland) when she announced that she had been a practicing witchfor the past fifteen years, had attended Sabbats, and had sexual intercoursewith the Devil (whose semen was “as cold as spring water”). The notion that shewas insane or simply hysterical is contradicted by the fact that several of thewitches she named made full confession, without torture, and corroborated herstatements in detail. Isobel claims that she encountered the Devil, a man ingrey, when travelling between two farms, and that she agreed to meet him in thechurch at Auldearne, where he made her renounce Jesus. He came to her in bed afew days later and copulated with her; she found his penis thick and long andhis semen “abundant and as cold as ice.” Elsewhere in this book we haveencountered women who had a similar experience—for example, Mrs. Fielding, andPlayfair’s Marcia. And from the drop in temperature that usually occurs duringspirit manifestations, we might also expect his semen to be cold. Isobel Gowdiealso mentions various acts of black magic, by which people are killed, and(significantly) a visit to fairyland, where she encountered the Queen of theFaery.Again, the case of the Salem witches suddenly becomes more comprehensible whenwe consider it in this light. In 1692, the daughter and niece of the ReverendSamuel Parris began having convulsions like the possessed nuns of Loudun—and adoctor gave his opinion that they were bewitched. Parris had come from Barbados,and had brought with him a number of black servants, including a woman calledTituba, who knew a great deal about magic or voodoo. The girls had apparentlybeen trying out some of these magical ceremonies at a remote spot in thecountryside. When a magistrate questioned the girls about their convulsions,they screamed and claimed that they were being bitten and pinched. At the trialTituba fully admitted practicing witchcraft and having dealings with the Devil.The affair was blown up by local hysteria until over a hundred people wereaccused, and twenty-two executed (not including Tituba). Montague Summers arguesconvincingly that there was a witches’ “coven” in the area (although its membershad nothing to do with “bewitching” the children). But if Tituba was genuinelyskilled in voodoo, and the children tried practicing it, then the result maywell have been poltergeist manifestations, complete with scratches and bites,and “demoniacal possession” producing convulsions. Anne Putnam, the oldest ofthe girls, was of the right age—twelve—and was physically mature.Magic prescribes certain rituals and precautions to protect the would-besorcerer from unfriendly spirits. When these are not observed, the results canbe alarming. Even a simple séance can be dangerous if the participants areinexperienced. In Mysteries, I have described the experience of Bill Slater,former head of BBC television drama, who made facetious remarks at a séance witha Ouija board, and woke up in the middle of the night convinced that someinvisible entity was trying to take over his body. He says that it was “massingitself on my chest, making every effort to take over my mind and body.” It tooktwenty minutes of intense struggle before he could “push it away.”The psychical investigator, Leonard Boucher—quoted in an earlier chapter—hasdescribed how, after an improvised séance (in an attempt to contact the recentlydeparted husband of his hostess), he and his wife spent a highly disturbed nightat the House of Knock, near Stranraer.After retiring and switching off the light, the room seemed to take on a chillyatmosphere, although it was summer time and the air outside was very warm. A fewminutes later there came from under the bed a loud scratching noise as if anextra-large cat had been trapped underneath . . . Investigation proved thatthere was not a single cat anywhere around. Getting back into bed and againturning off the light, we were startled to feel the bedclothes suddenly pulledoff the bed. This unpleasant operation was repeated several times over the nexthour or so, and throughout the whole night we heard bumps and thuds coming fromvarious parts of the room. Probably looking rather weary and worn, I explainedthe next morning to our hostess that we had not slept too well; she thenremarked that she too had a restless night owing to scratchings and bangings inher room.In spite of which, Leonard Boucher states his conviction that the poltergeist isa manifestation of the unconscious mind—a conviction that hardly seems toexplain his experience in the House of Knock.What this seems to suggest, then, is that almost anybody can “summon up” aspirit, especially if they happen to have mediumistic powers. Witches andshamans summon them deliberately; and in that case, their main problem iscontrolling them. Much depends, of course, on the intention. People who playaround with Ouija boards to pass an idle hour are likely to attract some passingvagabond of a spirit, and the results may then be unpredictable. Mediums seem toattract “controls” who then act as policemen and keep out the undesirables. Buteven they are not always successful. John Dee, for example, was always beingtold that the information he received the previous day was all useless becauseit came from a mischievous intruder . . . But serious intentions are likely toproduce the best results, whether or not the “magician” has any previousexperience. This is illustrated by a case recounted to me by a Filipino girl,Mimitan Wigan, of the Besao tribe of the Wester Bontoc. The Besao are abreakaway group from the Bontoc (part of the Igarot tribes), who are war-likehead hunters. The Besao are peaceable, and have concentrated on developing theirnatural psychic powers; they are, for example, skilled in healing andrain-making.Mimitan’s Aunt Kadmali lived (and still lived at the time of first writing) inthe mountain village of Dandanak, on Luzon; she is now in her eighties. When shereached the age of thirteen, she inherited an orchard or plantation that grewpineapples, oranges, lemons and other fruits. But the orchard was mysteriouslybeing plundered. One night, the girl sat outside the house, and prayed andchanted until dawn; she was praying for the nature spirit to reveal to her theidentity of the thief. At dawn, she went into the orchard, and, to herastonishment, found a man with his arm uplifted to pick fruit, standing as ifparalyzed. Seeing that he was unable to move, Kadmali rushed off to herneighbors and brought them to witness the thief’s discomfiture. The man was ableto speak, and was asked how he intended to make reparation for his thefts; hesaid that he would work for the girl for a year without wages. As soon as he hadsaid this, he was able to move.Aunt Kadmali has since become well-known for her psychic powers; but her firstexperience of them was on this occasion. They are not regarded as in any wayunusual among the Besao, who—although Christian—take it for granted that humanbeings can commune with spirits. She is not regarded as a “witch” as she wouldbe in the West—because the Besao recognize that all human beings possess similarpowers, to a greater or lesser extent.All this throws a new light on the concept of witchcraft in Westerncivilization. There must have been a time when our ancestors took “shamanistic”powers for granted, as the Besao do. But this was when people lived close tonature. As soon as cities began to develop, attitudes toward these powers beganto change. H. G. Wells remarks that it was only ten thousand generations agothat human beings “were brought together into a closeness of contact for whichtheir past had not prepared them.” And he points out that these cities were notcommunities, but “jostling crowds in which quite unprecedented reactions werepossible.” People were living more closely together than ever before, yet wereseparated by a new hostility, a sense of mutual isolation. Crime became the ruleinstead of the exception. And the city dwellers created their own exaggeratedmental image of witchcraft and magic. Now they were no longer in daily contactwith the real thing, they invented stories of magic and malevolence, witcheswith sagging breasts and pointed nails who desecrate the dead and summon demons.Lucan’s Erichtho, the foul and evil hag who digs up graves and destroys crops,is a symbol of horror, like Dracula or Frankenstein’s monster; there is nothingreal about her.It is tempting to jump to the conclusion that we have simply lost contact withnature and with the hidden powers of the unconscious mind, and that the solutionmay be to turn a suspicious eye on the idea of technological progress—like theinhabitants of the village of Sagada, on Luzon, who have simply ignored theelectricity that has been brought to their homes, and continue to use oil lampsand cooking fires. But this would be an oversimplification. The members of aprimitive tribe may have a deeper understanding of nature than do city dwellers;but this does not necessarily mean a deeper understanding of themselves. Ananimal’s attitude to nature is passive; it simply adjusts itself, and choosesthe path of least resistance. Primitive peoples are inclined to do the same. Thehardship of city life caused people to take a more active attitude towards theirown existence. Witchcraft continued to exist; but it took on a darker coloring,since, as far as the city-dweller was concerned, magic was simply a short cut topower and wealth, or an instrument of revenge. The magician ceased to be theshaman, who lived in conformity with nature and conversed with spirits, andbecame the sorcerer, the person of power who could “summon up spirits from thevasty deep.” There is a sense in which the magician—from Simon Magus to John Deeor Aleister Crowley—is a new human archetype. These suspect that they have farmore power than human beings generally take for granted. And they areundoubtedly correct. The spirit of Cornelius Agrippa and Faust has createdmodern civilization and modern science. So although this new relation to naturemay be in some ways a bad one—full of aggression and alienation and hubris—it isstill an important advance beyond the primitive attitude of passivity in theface of nature. It would be absurd for members of Western civilization to thinkof exchanging hard-won knowledge for the ancient simplicity. What is needed isto rediscover the things we have long forgotten, the truths that the Besao takefor granted.And if a primitive shaman were asked to state the most basic of these forgottentruths, he would reply: We are not alone on this planet; we are surrounded allthe time by unseen spirits. Western men and women find this idea disturbing anddisquieting because it seems to be a return to the superstition that made ourancestors cross themselves against the evil eye. Such misgivings may bejustified. Nevertheless, we have seen that an objective examination of the factsabout the poltergeist points to the conclusion that it is some form ofearth-bound spirit. I have to admit that I reached this conclusion with extremereluctance; from the scientific point of view it would be far more acceptable ifwe could agree with William Roll that poltergeist phenomena originate in theunconscious mind. But the facts point in another direction.How, for example, can the RSPK theory explain the curious events which werestill—as I wrote these words—going on in the pub in Croydon called the King’sCellars?[1] In the autumn of 1980, shortly after I had returned frominterviewing the Pritchard family in Pontefract, Guy Playfair told me somethingof the Croydon poltergeist, which he and Maurice Grosse had been studying forthe past year. It apparently caused the usual phenomena—bottles and glassesfloating off shelves or simply smashing on the floor, sudden chills,inexplicable malfunctions of tills. As Guy and I were walking along OxfordStreet, talking about the case, we encountered a friend of Guy’s from the SPR,who had been in contact with the pub earlier in the day, and who said thatseveral tills had jammed at the same time, although the firm that supplied themcould find nothing wrong with them. This piece of synchronicity decided me, andI phoned the pub’s manager—Mike Delaney—to ask if I could come down and see formyself. I asked an old friend, the psychic Robert Cracknell, if he would like togo with me.The King’s Cellars proved to be less of a public house than a kind ofcontinental bar, with a cellar which is also a restaurant. The downstairs barhas been decorated to look “ancient,” with imitation masonry. The manager, Mike,had been there for only a few months; the previous manager and his wife had leftabruptly, after deciding to separate. This, Mike told us, seemed to be one ofthe unfortunate characteristics of the place: in the twelve years it had beenopen, it had wrecked the marriages of about a dozen couples.He had been sent there by the brewery to act as a stop-gap until another managercould be found—he was the brewery’s “trouble-shooter,” who went to pubs thatwere having problems. When he arrived, he knew nothing about the place, andcertainly did not believe in ghosts or poltergeists. On the fifth night, hestayed late to examine and balance the books. And, since it was a lock-up pub,he decided to stay there overnight in a sleeping bag. After working at thebooks, he lay down in the sleeping bag on a padded seat. The place seemedunusually cold—far colder than it should have been. And as he closed his eyes,he heard the sound—a rattle of glasses. He sat up, then went over to the bar.All the glasses on the top shelf were vibrating, as if a juggernaut lorry wasgoing past. But there was no juggernaut; all was silent. The place was now soicy that he decided to go upstairs and sleep in the office. The next morning hewent back to the hotel where he was staying for a shower, locking the pub behindhim. When he returned to the downstairs bar, he was surprised to find it coveredin broken glass. The row of glasses that had been vibrating had been swept allover the floor. To do this, three dozen glasses had had to cross the bar.Then the tills began to go wrong. They were new electronic tills, and weresupposed to be foolproof. One night, one of the tills was apparently more than£26,000 short. It was absurd. When a member of staff was approaching atill—together with a stocktaker—it suddenly rang up £999. The suppliers sent anengineer, who could find nothing whatever wrong. The telephones would also beginto malfunction, for no obvious reason; again, engineers could trace no fault.One morning, all the ashtrays—which had been left, full, on the top of thebar—had been neatly emptied on to the floor, making a long, continuous line ofash; but they had been on the bar when Mike had locked up the pub the nightbefore.Another problem was the lavatories. These would flood for no obvious reason—evenwhen there was no one in them. When this happened, they went icy cold. On oneoccasion, a stream of water shot up out of the urinal, flooding the place. Butthis should have been impossible, for the urinal was simply a metal trough, atthigh level, with a pipe descending from it into the floor-level gutter; watercould flood into the trough from the tank above, but this was shooting up fromthe trough itself. Plumbers could find nothing wrong with the water system inthe lavatories.Oddly enough, Mike was not unduly disturbed about all this; neither was hiswife, Shirley. She had been there only six weeks, and had seen nothing. She toldme she thought she was “ESP-thick.” Mike now had no doubt that the place was“haunted,” but it did not bother him unduly. He said, “I love this place, and Iintend to stay.” After years of moving from pub to pub, he had found one heliked. A poltergeist was a nuisance, but it did no real harm—except scaring thestaff. It had swept a whole row of beer bottles off the upstairs bar one day,smashing them all. One warm evening, it had made the downstairs bar so cold thattwo huge fan heaters had no effect, and Mike was forced to close it down. WhenMaurice Grosse arrived one day with a television crew, it had made a smell sodisgusting, accompanied by the usual freezing cold, that they all felt sick. Oneday, with customers in the bar, flames suddenly crept up the wall—with an oddlybright light—and across the ceiling; then they extinguished themselves. Thelikeliest explanation seemed some odd electrical fault; but neither thefire-prevention officer nor the electricity board could find anything wrong.Stella, the catering supervisor—who had been there longest—had watched a bottleof wine sail across the room, to shatter itself against a wall.Maurice Grosse came while Bob Cracknell and I were eating lunch in thedownstairs bar, and we talked about the case. He agreed that the most puzzlingthing about it was the lack of a “focus.” The disturbances had been going on foryears. They had not worked themselves up to a climax, as in most cases. Andthere seemed to be no single person who might provide the entity—if that waswhat it was—with energy.As we were speaking, someone shouted: “It’s happening again.” We all rushed downto the ladies’ lavatory. It felt icy cold, and the floor was covered in water,which had gushed out of the lavatory pan.When I left the place at midafternoon, I had reached only one conclusion: Thiswas obviously a thoroughly non-typical case. A female member of the staff wasreported to have seen a ghost—a woman—in an annex of the downstairs bar, but Iwas unable to speak to her. A girl had committed suicide by throwing herselffrom the Nestlé building opposite the pub, landing on the roof, and Mike seemedto think that this could have been the cause of the “haunting.” One of themanagers had fallen downstairs late at night, and had been found dead in themorning. But no one seemed certain exactly when this had occurred.I kept in touch with Maurice Grosse, who said he would let me know if there wereany interesting developments. A few weeks later, Bob Cracknell rang me, to tellme that Shirley had walked out. She had been alone in the downstairs bar late atnight, and had apparently seen something. She had refused to say what it was—hadsimply walked out and refused to go back. (I have her voice on tape saying howmuch she liked the pub, and that she had no intention of going away.) Mikehimself, said Bob, also looked as if he was beginning to feel the strain; but hestill said he had no intention of leaving.A few weeks later, Bob rang me again. Mike had quite suddenly decided he couldtake no more, and he too had walked out. He had found himself some kind of jobin Africa, and intended to go in mid-January. Meanwhile, he badly needed a rest;could he come down and stay with us in Cornwall? I said he would be welcome and,in early January, Bob drove down with Mike, and left him with us. We could bothsee that Mike was under severe strain; he seemed exhausted and distracted. Headmitted that he had been drinking very heavily, and said that this was becausehe had begun to feel permanently exhausted. Day after day, as he opened the puband went down to the cellar, he encountered the same wall of cold at the foot ofthe stairs. Without Shirley, he had begun to feel the strain. One day, hesuddenly felt that if he stayed there any longer, it would drive him into anervous breakdown. He said that, late one night, he went down to the cellar, andsaid aloud: “All right, you’ve beaten me, I’m going.” Instantly, the placebecame freezing cold . . .Mike spent only a week with us, then decided to commit himself voluntarily tothe local mental home at Bodmin. A few days in St. Lawrence’s Hospital workedwonders; among people who were severely ill, his natural vitality and dominancereasserted themselves. He discharged himself in less than a week, spent a fewmore days with us—now drinking moderately again—and finally left for Africa. Ihave a cassette on which he talks for two hours about his experiences in theKing’s Cellars, and there is a great deal that I have left out of this account.As a poltergeist, the Croydon spirit was not particularly inventive; onlyincredibly persistent.Bob Cracknell rang me a few weeks later to say that he had interviewed thelatest manager, who told him that he did not believe in ghosts. About a monthlater, he phoned again to say the manager had just left.My only other contact in the Croydon area was Stephen Jenkins, the author of TheUndiscovered Country; I asked him if he would try and find out anything he couldabout the pub. His reply begins: “My researches into the supposed manifestationsin the King’s Cellars, Park Street, Croydon, have come into the expected ‘nothoroughfare,’ as I rather foresaw . . .”He goes on:Two things are clear, however, which suggest strongly that we are dealing withan area in which unusual phenomena might be expected, in view of what yourinquiries (and mine) elsewhere in this island have shown.First, an enormously long alignment passes quite close to the north-west end ofthe cellars. The alignment starts at the church in the moated site of JerichoPriory in Essex and goes to the centre of an earthwork at Valdoe. This isnortheast of Chichester, and inside the great system of concentric circularalignments that center on the old Roman forum. This great Essex/West Sussex linepasses through some important-seeming nodal points, some of which are(supposedly) the sites of curious manifestation . . .He goes on to say that a map of Croydon for 1847 shows a house in its own parkclose to the site of the present King’s Cellars. He concludes:All that I can offer is the observation that long experience has led me toexpect odd occurrences to be situated on or very near alignments, especially atthe nodes. Further, houses or the sites of buildings on or adjacent to leys aremore likely to be the haunts of phenomena. I must not omit to note that thevanished house on the plan of 1874 touches—or is on—the long Jericho Priory toValdoe earthwork alignment . . .In the Croydon case, then, the “human focus” theory seems to be unstable. Astraightforward haunting remains a possibility, and here we have at least two“suspects”—the landlord who died at the foot of the stairs, and the girl whocommitted suicide from the Nestlé building. Before the King’s Cellars became apub, it was a fire station, and this may also have been associated with sometragedy. Yet the disturbances are clearly of the poltergeist type, if we ignorethe dubious sighting of a female ghost in the annex. The likeliest theory, then,is that we are here dealing with some mischievous entity of the elemental type,which draws some of its energy from human beings, and some from the site itself.This, of course, begs the question of what is an “elemental”? In his bookOperation Trojan Horse, which deals with the mystery of UFOs, John Keel has achapter which discusses the problem.Throughout history occultists have called these [mysterious visitors]elementals. There are several kinds of elementals in psychic lore. One type issupposedly conjured up by secret magical rites and can assume any form rangingfrom that of a beautiful woman to hideous, indescribable monsters. Once a witchor a warlock has whipped up such a critter, it will mindlessly repeat the sameactions century after century in the same place until another occultist comesalong and performs the rite necessary to dissolve it.Keel points out that these “thought forms” can be encountered in traditionalmagic from Tibet to Ireland. In Tibet they are called tulpas, and AlexandraDavid-Neel’s book on Tibet contains a great deal of information about them. Sheclaims to have created an imaginative “projection” of a monk that looked sosolid that a herdsman took him for a real lama. This thought form eventuallybegan to get beyond her control and become hostile, and she claims that it tooksix months of hard work to “dematerialize” him. Otherwise he might havecontinued to haunt her, or, more likely, have remained behind in the area wherehe was created, and been seen by people as a ghost. George Owen’s Toronto teamseem to have created a kind of tulpa in Philip, the manufactured ghost. InPsychic Self Defence, the occultist Dion Fortune has a story of how sheinvoluntarily created an “elemental” when she was thinking negative thoughtsabout someone who had done her an injury. In a semi-dozing state, she thought ofFenris, the Nordic wolf-god—probably (although she does not say so) fantasizingon how satisfactory it would be to set it on her enemy.Immediately I felt a curious drawing-out sensation from my solar plexus, andthere materialized beside me on the bed a large wolf . . . I knew nothing of theart of making elementals at that time, but had accidentally stumbled upon theright method—the brooding highly charged with emotion, the invocation of theappropriate natural force, and the condition between sleeping and waking inwhich the etheric double readily extrudes.She ordered the creature out of the room and it went. But when people in thehouse began to dream of wolves and imagine yellow eyes shining out of thedarkness, she decided to “re-absorb” it, and succeeded in summoning it and thenturning it into a “shapeless grey mist.”So, according to this fragment of magical lore, an elemental is not a spiritentity but a “thought form” which has somehow acquired a kind of life of itsown. This view certainly offers a better explanation of fairies and similarcreatures than Conan Doyle’s suggestion that they are a separate line ofevolution. It suggests that “fairies” exist where people believe in them, andthat you would expect to find a “ju-ju spirit” in Africa where generations havedirected their thoughts at a particular tree as the home of an ancestral spirit,and “sidhe” in Ireland.This theory goes a long way toward explaining many traditional hauntings; forexample, the old man of Ash Manor could conceivably have been a “thought form,”projected by some previous owner—perhaps accidentally, like Dion Fortune’swolf—and revitalized by the atmosphere of hostility and neurosis in the familyof the latest occupants. But why do so many such “ghosts” seem capable ofpoltergeist activity? The Cornish historian Harold Phelps has described his ownencounter with a “ghost” in his old family home in a Berkshire village; thehouse had been built in the time of Elizabeth the First by Sir John Phelps,executed in 1660. In the early 1920s, Harold Phelps was visiting the aunt whothen lived in the house, and when she mentioned a haunted room, asked if hecould sleep in it. He was then in his mid-teens and, as a science student, wasfirmly convinced of the unreality of the paranormal.For a considerable time . . . I lay as still as I could listening for the leastsound. As absolutely nothing happened, I must have fallen into a deep sleep . .. At some moment in the night I was woken up very suddenly by a most frightfulracket in the room. I reached for my torch, half-sitting up in bed, and evenbefore I could switch on the torch I received a stinging slap across my leftcheek. At the same instant I got the light on, and the room was obviously empty. . . The two cane chairs were overturned. . . and my money, keys and smalleffects had been knocked off the dressing-table and scattered all over the room.Here the deciding factor may have been that the teenage boy was an unconsciousmedium. But whatever was present in the “haunted room” was presumably therebefore he arrived. So again, we have the puzzling phenomenon of an entity thatdeclines to fit any of the normal categories of psychical researches.Could it be, perhaps, that our preconceptions are simply too rigid, and thatthis is creating divisions and dichotomies where there are none? We are inclinedto make a simple and sharp distinction: between living creatures (or spirits)and “illusions” or tape recordings, which—to some extent—owe their existence tothe human mind. So, in a case like the one cited above, we ask: was there reallya ghost present in the haunted room, or was it a delusion (or some form ofprojection) of Harold Phelps’ mind? Yet the two categories may not really bemutually exclusive. In the previous chapter, Eileen Garrett’s “control” Uvanideclared: “Life cannot die. You can explode its dynamism, but you cannotdissipate its energy. If you suffered where life suffered, the essence that oncefilled the frame will take from you something to dramatize and live again.” Toour normal way of thinking, this hardly seems to make sense. The “ghost” of theold man sounds like a “person,” not a revivified memory (i.e., a “recording”).But this is because we have the idea of a person so deeply embedded in our ownway of thinking. We forget that it is connected largely with the physical body:a person looks solid and real so he must be an “individual.” Yet most peoplehave experienced mental states—for example, in high fever—when the personalityseems to have disintegrated. As absurd as it sounds, “I” am still there, butthat “I” is not “me.” It is a kind of disembodied being without a “self.” Peoplewho have seen someone they know well lose their faculties—through illness orsenility—have this same eerie sensation: that the body of the person remains,yet the “person” is no longer in it. In other words, our concept of a“personality” may contain certain fundamental errors. For example, if, in a highfever, “I” exist without my “personality,” then I could imagine my personalitygoing elsewhere, and manifesting itself independent of “me.” And this seems tobe getting close to what Uvani is talking about. Perhaps we shall not be in aposition to understand ghosts and poltergeists until we have eliminated theerrors from our thinking.The Glastonbury Scripts hint at this same concept of personality. The monkJohannes asked, at one point:Why cling I to that which is not? It is I, and it is not I, but parte of mewhich dwelleth in the past and is bound to that whych my carnal soul loved andcalled “home” these many years. Yet I, Johannes, amm of many partes, and yebetter parte doeth other things Laus, Laus Deo! [praise be to God]—only thatpart which remembereth clingeth like memory to what it seeth yet.Here there are many suggestive hints “It is I, and it is not I”—“part of mewhich dwelleth in the past” and “which remembereth [and] clingeth like memory towhat it seeth yet.” And this presumably means that if some “sensitive” atGlastonbury saw the “ghost” of Johannes, it would be seeing this part of himthat clings to the past, not “ye better parte.” All of which suggests that oursimplistic notion of a “soul” inside a body may be too crude to explain thefacts of psychic phenomena. It totally fails, for example, to explain whathappens in the “projection of the double”—as when Mrs. Fielding made her doublevisit her husband in their home while her body sat in the laboratory. We havealso seen that in many cases, people are unaware that they are projecting their“double”—like Canon Bourne; which implies that the everyday “I” which knows whatwe are doing is quite ignorant of a great deal that goes on inside us. In occultphilosophy, the double—or doppelganger—is also known as the “etheric double.”There also seems to be a part of us that could be called the “mental double.”This is illustrated in another classic case, that of Gordon Davis, recorded bythe well-known investigator Dr. S. G. Soal. At the turn of the century, Dr. Soalwas at school with a boy called Gordon Davis, and in 1920, he heard that Davishad been killed in the Great War. Soal began attending séances with Mrs. BlancheCooper in 1921, and at one of these séances, the “spirit” of Gordon Davis spokethrough the medium. It declared that its only worry now were the wife andchildren. Davis asked Soal if he remembered their last conversation, andreminded him that it had been a chance meeting on a train. At a subsequentséance, Davis tried to describe the house where his wife lived. There were sixsteps—or rather, five and a half. It was not in a street but in “half a street.”Opposite the house there was “something like a veranda.” There was a kind ofdark tunnel nearby. In the house there was a big mirror and various pictures oflandscapes, as well as some large vases. Downstairs, a room with brasscandlesticks on the shelf. A woman and a little boy lived in the house . . .Three years later, Soal learned by chance that the house was in Southend-on-Sea,and he went to investigate. Everything was exactly as the “spirits” haddescribed it. The house was on the esplanade facing the sea—therefore on “half astreet.” Opposite the house was a bus-shelter—a kind of “veranda.” There weresix steps, one of which was very thin. There was a dark tunnel next to the houseleading to the back gardens of the block. Inside the house there was a largemirror, various landscapes, big vases, and brass candlesticks in the downstairsdining room. And Gordon Davis himself was in the house, alive and well, togetherwith his wife and five-year-old son. Davis had no knowledge whatever about the“spirit” that had given all this information at the séance.It is conceivable, of course, that this was another earth-bound spirit playinggames. But if not, then it was a fragment of Davis’ personality that waswandering around—unknown to its owner.A book called Journeys Out of the Body seems to support this latter view. Theauthor, Robert Monroe, is an American businessman who one day, to hisastonishment, found that he could leave his body—the ability known as “astralprojection.” In August 1963, he decided to “visit” a female businessacquaintance whom he calls R.W. He found himself in her kitchen, sitting in achair and drinking from a glass; two girls were also with her. He asked R.W. ifshe knew he was there, and she replied (mentally), “Oh yes.” He asked her if shewould remember, and she said she would. Monroe said he would pinch her to makesure, and did so; she gave a loud shout of pain. Later, Monroe asked her whathad happened. She had no memory whatever of seeing or conversing (mentally) withMonroe. But she was in the kitchen with two girls; she suddenly felt a pinch,and jumped up in alarm. She showed Monroe the bruise produced by the pinch(which seems to demonstrate, beyond all doubt, that the “astral body” canproduce physical effects). On another occasion, Monroe visited the researcherAndrija Puharich in his study, and held a mental conversation with him. Puharichlater agreed that he had been in the study and that everything Monroe said aboutit was correct; but he had no memory of a conversation.In his book The Romeo Error, Lyall Watson reviews the evidence for “astraltravel,” and makes the suggestion that human beings may have no less than seven“bodies” or levels upon which they exist, the first three being the physicalbody, the “etheric” level (the level of the “aura” which is supposed to surroundthe human body), and the astral level. The Spiritualist philosophy asserts thatwhen we die, we move on to the “astral plane,” shedding the physical body like agarment; but there are various planes beyond this. This suggests the interestingnotion that if human beings possess an “astral body,” they may also possess“bodies” belonging to the various other planes. And we have already seen thatsome such notion seems to be suggested by the whole problem of multiplepersonality. It is as if human beings contain a whole series of “selves,”arranged in the form of a ladder (a concept I have developed at length in a bookcalled Mysteries).Monroe’s experiences “outside the body” seem to be in many ways consistent withnotions explored in this book. For example, in a chapter called “IntelligentAnimals,” he writes: “Throughout man’s history, the reports have beenconsistent. There are demons, spirits, goblins, gremlins and assorted sub-humanentities always hanging around humanity to make life miserable.” And he, goes onto describe a number of disturbing experiences in his “OOB” states. A kind ofchild climbed on to his back, and forced him to “retreat” back into his body.The next time he “left the body,” the same entity climbed on to his back; whenhe tugged at the leg, it stretched like rubber. Two of the rubbery beings—whichnow seemed shapeless—proceeded to “attack”’ him, although it was with a casualpersistence rather than malice. Finally, a “man” came along, picked up the twoentities, and seemed to cause them to deflate. On another occasion, Monroe wasthreatened—or attacked—by three humanoid figures who seemed to be hooligans ofthe astral plane. He also describes an attack from some sort of invisible animalthat seemed to be determined to “take” vitality from him—a struggle heterminated by returning to his physical body, which lay in bed.These entities begin to sound very much like the beings we encounter in cases of“possession.” But even here, there is ambiguity. In his book on possession,Oesterreich cites one of the best known cases in the literature, that of Janet’spatient “Achille.” Achille was a businessman who had been brought up in areligious family; returning from a business trip in 1890, he sank intodepression, then went dumb. After waking from a two-day coma, he becameconvinced that he was in hell, then declared that the Devil was inside him. Hescreamed and uttered horrible blasphemies. Finally, he was confined in theSalpêtrière. Janet was fascinated by the case. Achille would curse God in a deepvoice, then protest in his own voice that the Devil had made him do it. LikeFather Surin of Loudun, he evidently felt that the Devil was making use of hisbody, “making him” do things.Janet made the interesting discovery that he could communicate with the “Devil”without Achille noticing—by placing a pencil on Achille’s fingers, then askingthe “Devil” questions in a low voice. The “Devil” would write replies.Janet asked who he was. “The Devil,” came the reply. Achille asked if he couldmake Achille raise his arm, and Achille’s arm rose. When Janet pointed this outto Achille, he was astonished. “That demon has played another trick on me.”After a number of similar experiments, Janet asked if the Devil could putAchille to sleep. Earlier attempts to hypnotize Achille had failed, but he nowfell asleep, and when Janet asked him questions, he replied without opening hiseyes. Janet now discovered the cause of Achille’s illness; on his last businesstrip he had committed a “grave misdeed”—probably going to bed with a prostitute.On his return home he brooded on his guilt, and was afraid he would blurt it outto his wife—hence the psychosomatic dumbness. Things had quickly gone from badto worse until Achille fell into a coma, and woke up convinced he was possessed.Janet arranged for Achille’s wife to visit him in hospital and to pronounceforgiveness; Achille immediately began to recover. Although he still dreamed ofhellish torments at night, he laughed at his superstitions during the day, untilthe fears and hallucinations vanished.Janet cites the case as an example of multiple personality: Achille’s ownterrors convinced him he was possessed, his anxiety produced a state of tensionin which he was in a permanent state of hysteria—trapped in the left brain, asit were—and his subconscious mind proceeded to play tricks. But thepossession-hypothesis fits just as well. Achille came back from his businesstrip in a state of neurotic worry, and allowed himself to become more and moreanxious—so becoming increasingly weak and passive. He fell into a coma, whichallowed a mischievous “elemental” to take over. Fortunately; like mostelementals, it was stupid, and allowed itself to be persuaded to place Achillein a trance. As soon as Janet knew what was troubling Achille, she possessed themeans of persuading Achille to “fight back.” And slowly, the more responsibleand mature part of Achille gained control . . .We may either take our choice of these two views, or we may decide that they arenot mutually exclusive. If “spirits” can pass in and out of our bodies at will,as Kardec says, then perhaps many of the feelings and emotions we assume to be“our own” are caused by the intruder. Perhaps our belief that we are“individuals” is a mistake, and we are a whole assemblage of people, with one ofthem more-or-less “in charge.” According to Gurdjieff, we do not possess one“self” but dozens; this is why we are so changeable, and find it so difficult tocomplete things we set out to do. Gurdjieff’s comment seems to be only “a mannerof speaking” since our changeableness is really a lack of self-discipline. Butperhaps he intended it as more than a manner of speaking. Perhaps the first stepto understanding these mysteries would be to think of ourselves as a“conglomerate” rather than as individuals, as a mass of personalities andsub-personalities and personality fragments.Such notions as these are thoroughly foreign to our Western modes of thought;yet they can be found in many other cultures. For example, the notion of man’s“seven bodies” is to be found in Hindu and Egyptian occultism, and is discussedin the books of Madame Blavatsky and Annie Besant, as well as in works like A.E. Powell’s The Astral Body and The Etheric Double. And the concept of multiplepersonality has been used by Max Freedom Long to buttress a system of ideasoriginating in Africa and now represented mainly in the Kahuna culture ofPolynesia. Long’s book The Secret Science Behind Miracles contains a great dealthat is relevant to this investigation of the poltergeist.Long arrived in Hawaii in 1917 and became intrigued by references to nativemagicians, kahunas or “keepers of the secret.” All his attempts to find out moreabout them encountered a brick wall. The kahunas, apparently, had been outlawedby the Christians, but their practices continued to survive. Long heard about alocal minister who had challenged a kahuna to a contest of prayers; the kahunadeclared that he would pray the minister’s congregation to death. Long actuallysaw the diary of this minister, reporting death after death in his congregation.Finally, the minister persuaded someone to teach him the magic involved in thedeath prayer, and tried a counter attack. The kahuna magician died within threedays. The missionary seceded from the church, and built his own small chapel,over which he continued to preside.At this point, Long met a doctor, William Tufts Brigham, who had been studyingthe kahunas for years. He was able to give Long certain vital clues. And later,in America, Long studied the Hawaiian language, and gradually began to crack the“code.” One of his first discoveries was that the kahunas seem to accept thatman has at least two “selves.” (He later discovered that there is a third.)The Kahuna idea of the conscious and subconscious seems to be, judging from theroot meaning of the names given to them, a pair of spirits closely joined in abody which is controlled by the subconscious and used to cover and hide themboth. The conscious spirit is more human and possesses the ability to talk. Thegrieving subconscious weeps tears, dribbles water and otherwise handles thevital force of the body. It does its work with secrecy and silent care, but itis stubborn and disposed to refuse to obey. It refuses to do things when itfears the gods (holds a complex or fixation of ideas), and it intermingles ortinctures the conscious spirit to give the impression of being one with it.A number of important points are stated here. The “subconscious” spiritintermingles so closely with its partner that we do not realize that it has aseparate identity. But this spirit is rebellious and highly emotional. Itrefuses to obey. Long is here speaking of what Poe meant by the “imp of theperverse,” which has been mentioned elsewhere in this book: that curioustendency of the human mind to turn against itself. There is part of us thatseems to be little better than an immature child, howling with misery and defeatwhen confronted by problems it regards as “unfair.” This part of us is dangerousbecause we fail to recognize it is a separate entity, and may be unaware of itsexistence until it has betrayed us into some act of stupidity. We have all metpeople who seem to be balanced, strong, self-possessed, and who, when confrontedby some sudden frustration or injury to their self-esteem, become mean, pettyand often violent; we stand aghast at this sudden revelation of theirimmaturity. Until we can recognize this element in ourselves, we are unable totake the measures that might bring it under control.In addition to these two “souls,” we also “possess” (or “are”?) a higher self, asuperconscious being who might be regarded as the guardian angel, and—this isperhaps the most interesting suggestion—controls our future. It does soaccording to the desires and suggestions of the “middle self—the consciousego—and most of us have such messy lives because our suggestions are so muddledand contradictory.These three souls use three kinds of vital force, or mana, each with a different“voltage,” so to speak. The form used by the higher self is symbolized inreligions by the sun. Long adds the interesting comment that mana can be storedup in wood and in water—a remark that would have excited Tom Lethbridge.By way of illustrating this vital force on its lowest level, Long cites NandorFodor’s Encyclopaedia of Psychic Science, and Lombroso’s case of the poltergeistin the tavern. For the poltergeist, according to Long, is a spirit—“lower soul”which has somehow, in death, become separated from the middle and higher selves.According to Long, the lower self possesses memory, and the middle self doesnot. So a disembodied lower self is an earthbound spirit of the type that causespoltergeist disturbances. The disembodied middle self, separated from the otherselves, is a wandering wraith without memory—in fact, what we would generallyregard as a ghost. According to Long, then, the old man who haunted Ash Manorwould be a disembodied “middle self.”The death prayer, and other forms of black magic, are, according to Long,performed by means of low spirits, who obey the magician. On this point he istotally in agreement with the view put forward by Andrade and Playfair. Theselow spirits lack intelligence, and (like the low self) are highly suggestive tohypnotic suggestion. Long tells a typical story of his master, Dr. Brigham.Brigham had hired a party of Hawaiian natives to climb a mountain, and one ofthem (a fifteen-year-old boy) became ill. His feet had become numb, and thenumbness was slowly rising up his body—a sign that someone had practiced thedeath prayer on him. Brigham questioned the boy, who then remembered that beforehe left his native village, the local kahuna—witch doctor (who hated theinfluence of white men)—had declared that any villager who worked for the whiteswould become a victim of the death prayer. The boy had, in fact, worked withHawaiians until Long offered him a job in his party, and the boy had accepted itwithout thinking of the consequences.Because of his study of the Huna religion, Brigham was regarded by the nativesas a powerful kahuna—an idea he encouraged—so they now asked him if he woulddirect the death prayer back at the magician who had sent it. With sometrepidation, Brigham decided to try. Standing above the boy, he spoke aloud tothe spirits, praising and flattering them, then argued warmly that the boy wasan innocent victim, and that it was the kahuna who sent them who ought to bedestroyed. He then directed them to return and leave the boy alone. For anotherhour, he kept his mind concentrated on this idea until quite suddenly, he said,the tension seemed to vanish, and the boy declared that he could feel his legsagain. Soon after, the boy was quite well. In order to verify if the “magic” hadworked, Brigham got the boy to take him to his own village, where the villagersfled at the sight of the white magician. It seemed that, on the night Brighamhad redirected the prayer, the magician had come suddenly out of his hut wherehe had been sleeping, told the people that the white magician had redirected hisprayer, and that he had omitted to take any ritual precautions against suchredirection because he believed he was in no danger. By morning, the kahuna wasdead.How did the kahuna know that the boy was working for a white man? The “spirits”told him. The same clairvoyance should have protected him from Brigham’s attack;Brigham thinks that this attack was successful because the kahuna had gone tosleep early, and woke up to find himself already under attack.The death prayer, Long says, depends on these “subconscious spirits,” which akahuna might inherit from another kahuna, or find for himself if he happens tobe sufficiently psychic. Long adds the disturbing comment that in the early daysin Hawaii, prisoners of war were sometimes given potent hypnotic suggestion tocause the subconscious spirit to separate from the “middle self” after death. Wemust return to this matter of hypnosis in a moment.When the low spirits reach the victim, they have to await the chance to enterhis body, and they can do this because they have been given a surcharge of mana,or vital force, by their master. Normally, says Long, the unconscious mind canprotect itself against invading spirits, because its vitality is greater thantheirs. The spirits of the death prayer have to enter by brute force, as itwere. They then proceed to drain the victim of vital force, which would causethe feet to grow numb, then the rest of the body. Having killed the victim, thespirits are now supercharged with energy.“In the event of a successful mission,” says Long, “the kahuna ordered hisspirit slaves to play until they used up the vital force they had taken . ..Their play usually took the form of what we would call ‘poltergeistactivities.’ They would throw objects, make loud noises, and create a bedlam ofsome proportions. Dr. Brigham once heard a great commotion in the hut of akahuna at night, and was later told that spirits were at play in this manner.”According to Long, this same mana can be transferred to a stick, which is thenused in war; when it strikes the victim, he receives a kind of paralyzing shock.He speaks of a Reo Indian medicine man who could knock a brave unconscious bymerely placing his finger against his chest.In order to offer further demonstration of his theory of the three spirits, Longturns to cases of multiple personality, citing Mary Reynolds and ChristineBeauchamp—already discussed in chapter 2. He then mentions an unusual case thathe heard from a Dr. Leapsley in Honolulu. The daughter of a prominent Californiaattorney had been a dual personality since she was a child, and the twoalternated every four years. At the age of four, the girl had gone into a deepsleep, and had apparently reverted to babyhood when she woke up. This babylearned very quickly—as Mary Reynolds did—and quickly developed into a personcompletely unlike the original girl. “Miss First” was studious, shy andretiring, “Miss Second” was a noisy tomboy. At the age of eight, Miss First cameback, unaware that she had been absent. At twelve, Miss Second returned oneafternoon. At sixteen, Miss Second fell asleep and woke up as Miss First, askingher mother to go on reading a book she had been reading when Miss Second tookover four years earlier.When the girl reached the age of twenty-eight, the parents consulted medicalmen, who decided to try to make the secondary personality go away throughhypnosis, or to cause the two to amalgamate. Under hypnosis, each personalityappeared, and the doctors learned that each was aware of the actions of theother by “reading” the other’s memory. Then the order to “blend” was given. Ithad no effect. More hypnosis was tried, and the two personalities were asked whythey had not blended; Miss First said she had been unable to carry out theinstructions.More hypnosis led to the “hypnotic syncope”—the body seemed to become dead.Then, suddenly, the lips moved, and a completely new personality spoke throughthem. This spoke in a firm voice, and seemed to be older and wiser than theother two. It was the voice of an old man. It explained that it had the twogirls under its guardianship, and that what the doctors were trying to do waswrong: the girls had to go on sharing the same body. When one of the doctorsthreatened to keep the girl hypnotized indefinitely the “guardian” repliedfirmly that in that case it would withdraw, and leave them with a corpse. Itspoke with such quiet conviction that the doctors decided not to put this to thetest.This, says Long, is an example of the “higher self.” But what about the twogirls? According to Long, multiple personality is simply a case of a body beinginvaded by a spirit—sometimes a low self, sometimes a middle self, sometimes acombination of the two. Long accepts without question the idea of “possession,”declaring that some “low selves” may prey on the living, draining their vitalenergy, or taking up residence in their bodies and rendering them insane. LikeArthur Guirdham, Long is convinced that much mental illness is a kind of“haunting” by spirits. But he points out that most people have very powerfulresistance to invading entities—even those sent by kahunas. Only peoplesuffering from deep-seated guilt feelings are fairly easy prey.Notions such as these will strike most people as absurd. Yet they seem toexplain some of the mysteries we have examined in this book more convincinglythan the “scientific” theories of psychologists and psychical researchers. Itseems curious that so many cases of multiple personality involve the samepattern—a repressed, well-behaved young woman, like Christine Beauchamp, DorisFischer, Mary Reynolds, sinking into a state of misery and low vitality, thenbeing “taken over” by a mischievous tomboy. In many such cases, the “takeover”occurs after some well-meaning psychiatrist has placed the girl under hypnosis,making her defenseless. In most cases, the invading entity is lacking inintelligence, and in no case has the secondary personality been more intelligentthan the primary one. (In the case of Doris Fischer, a number of lessintelligent entities seem to have taken over, each one more stupid than thelast.)Long’s picture of the world of “low spirits” is a depressing one: he even has achapter discussing “horrid things of darkness.”The world of invisible spirits is much like our solid earth in as much as it hasits jungles and wild animals so to speak. If in this world a man should go intowild country and meet lions, tigers and gorillas, he would have to defendhimself. The same applies over there in the world of disembodied things livingin their shadowy bodies. Fortunately for us, the contact with the shadowy worldis slight. Only now and then do the dangerous or actively evil things breakthrough to us and endanger our lives or sanity.Now it has to be admitted that a passage like this—with its suggestion of H. P.Lovecraft—arouses an automatic reflex of rejection, which in turn leads one toquestion the whole system of ideas of the kahunas. Some of Long’s storiescertainly sound like traveler’s tales. We find it difficult to accept the notionof a jilted girl making her ex-lover seriously ill by asking the spirit of herdead grandmother for vengeance. Yet everything Long says about poltergeists isconsistent with the tentative conclusions reached elsewhere in this book. Theydo behave like half-witted spirits; they do seem to have a certain limited powerof “possession”; they do seem to be easily influenced by remarks and suggestionsthrown off by human beings; they do seem to be capable of draining the physicalenergies of their victims. At the same time they are not fundamentally evil;their malice has often an almost jovial quality, and—like the fairies oflegend—they even seem to enjoy performing small services for people they like.(Jean Pritchard tells how she arrived home one day and found that the “blackmonk” had laid the table for tea.) Attempts to question them about their motivesusually fail because they lack the ability to reason. All these characteristicssound very much like the “lower spirits” of Freedom Long, and hardly at all likethe rebellious unconscious posited by William Roll, George Owen and Alan Gauld.It is, of course, this notion of hostile magic that the Western intellect findsmost difficult to accept. Yet Nandor Fodor himself, in spite of his support forthe “unconscious” theory, accepts both the idea of black magic and the deathwish. He speaks of a woman he knew in London who claimed to be skilled in theblack arts, and who told him how she had conjured up the Devil by hypnotizing aboy and sending him to summon the Devil. Fodor, in his role as psychoanalyst,says that he has no doubt that she tried to conjure up the Devil, but that hecould not believe that he had appeared to her. What probably happened, he says,is that the boy’s unconscious “rose to the occasion” and summoned up visualauditory hallucinations. Having said which, he tells how, when the woman lostsome silver spoons, she pronounced a curse against the thief, and how thewoman’s discharged cook dropped dead at the moment the curse was pronounced. Hegoes on to tell a story of a spy of his acquaintance who successfully willed anaccomplice to commit suicide. He goes on: “This man was a weird creature. He wasconvinced that he had a familiar spirit always ready to do his bidding . . .”Fodor later tells a story about G. R. S. Mead—an eminent student of theoccult—in which Mead describes how he himself survived an “astral attack”:I woke from a troubled sleep, but remained in a twilight state, as if under aspell. There was a growing chill in the air, or in my mind. I saw a soft glowand a menacing shape which boded evil and which I thought I recognized. I knew Iwas in danger, but the peril was not on the physical plane.Mead claims to have used his own knowledge to counter attack effectively.[2]Cases like these are easier to explain with reference to Long’s Huna conceptsthan to Fodor’s Freudian theories. The same is true of the puzzling case of theBarbados tomb, discussed by Father Thurston and many other writers onpoltergeist hauntings. The vault, hewn partly out of solid rock, was opened in1812—only five years after it had been used for the first time—and two coffinswere found standing on end. Four years later, the coffins had again beenscattered when the tomb was opened. When it happened for a third time, in 1819,the floor was scattered with fine sand; the following year, when the tomb wasopened again, the sand was undisturbed, but the coffins had again been thrownaround in the vault. The case seems completely non-typical of poltergeisthaunting; not only was there no disturbed teenager to act as “focus,” there wasno human being of any kind from whom the entity could have “borrowed” theenergy. But the island of Barbados has its voodoo practices, and the Hunaexplanation would be that some enemy of the family had sent spirits to dischargetheir excess mana in this way.The mana theory is, in a sense, the essence of Long’s spirit theory, and theaspect that would probably be the easiest to investigate scientifically. Longpoints out: “Modern studies of the vital electricity have been made by attachingwires to the skin of the body and of the scalp, then using very sensitiveinstruments to measure the electrical discharges.” In fact, the experiments ofHarold Burr in measuring the “life field” of trees and animals are now wellknown. Long adds:Life magazine files show in the issue of October 18, 1937, some pictures oftests with charts and graphs. Two voltages of electricity have been found, a lowvoltage in the body tissue and a higher voltage in the brain.And as an example of the use of mana he cites the “lifting experiment” that hasalways been popular at parties. The subject sits in a chair, and four peopleattempt to lift him with a single finger placed beneath his knees and armpits;it is, of course, impossible. All four now place their hands on the subject’shead in an alternating “pile” (that is, so that no person’s two hands aretogether) and concentrate for a moment. Then they remove their hands and quicklyattempt the lifting again; the subject can usually be raised without difficulty.(“Professor” Joad was much intrigued by this phenomenon, and described how hehad often seen heavy men sailing up toward the ceiling in one case, with a smallchild as one of the lifters.) According to Long, this is a simple demonstrationof the human ability to concentrate mana. And, if Long is correct, this is alsothe energy used by the poltergeist. (Elsewhere in the book, he mentions the caseof the Cottingley fairies, and implies that they are also “thought forms”created by mana.)Yet although the “spirit” theory seems, on the whole, to explain the phenomenarather more convincingly than the “unconscious” theory, it would be a mistake togo to the opposite extreme and dismiss the latter as a scientificrationalization. This would be throwing out the baby with the bath water. Tograsp the real importance of the unconscious theory, we have to go back to theorigins of organized psychical research, and to the first attempt by aninvestigator to create a comprehensive theory—Human Personality and Its Survivalof Bodily Death (1903) by F. W. H. Myers, one of the founders of the SPR. Myersis, in fact, less concerned with “life after death” than with the mysteriouspowers of the human mind. There are chapters on multiple personality, on genius,on hypnosis, and on specters of the living and the dead. Myers is fascinated,for example, by “calculating prodigies,” children (often of less than averageintelligence) who can do immense calculations in their heads within seconds.Myers ends by concluding that “discarnate spirits” exist; but his conclusionsare otherwise disappointingly tentative.Writing at about the same time as Myers, and from the same starting point, theAmerican Thomson Jay Hudson reached far more interesting conclusions. The Law ofPsychic Phenomena (1892) begins by considering the mystery of hypnosis, in whichthe powers of the hypnotic subject seem to be enormously increased. People inhypnotic trances have spoken foreign languages they have never studied (althoughit is usually found that they had unconsciously “absorbed” them in childhood)and have exercised powers of clairvoyance and telepathy. (We may recallBarrett’s hypnotized girl who winced when he held his hand over a candle flame,or the boy who could speak aloud the words in a book from which Ochorowitz wasreading.)Hudson then advances an important thesis: that we all contain “two selves” orminds. He calls these the objective mind and the subjective mind. The objectivemind is the conscious ego, whose business is to “cope” with the physical world.The subjective mind seems to be more concerned with our internal functions, andit works through intuition. The subjective mind is far more powerful than theobjective mind, which is why hypnotic subjects are capable of feats that theycould never perform through conscious effort. What excites Hudson is that thissubjective mind—or unconscious—is the servant of the objective mind, and willobey its commands. So, in theory we are all capable of becoming clairvoyant, orof curing our own illnesses (and those of other people) at will. (Hudsonconvinced himself of the soundness of these theories by performing someremarkable experiments in “absent healing.”)But because he is so impressed by the amazing powers of the subjective mind,Hudson concludes that it is responsible for all the phenomena ofSpiritualism—for example, automatic writing and “spirit voices.” He has, ofcourse, no difficulty in explaining multiple personality in terms of thesubjective mind. He is even convinced that it explains the miracles of the NewTestament. Only one major psychic manifestation is absent from his remarkablebook: the poltergeist. And this is obviously because he feels he would bestretching things too far to explain the violent movement of objects in terms ofthe subjective mind. (It was J. B. Rhine’s studies in psychokinesis in the 1930sthat opened the way for the RSPK theory of poltergeist phenomena.)In the 1960s, an American doctor named Howard Miller took up the theory of the“two minds” where Hudson left off. Miller became fascinated by hypnosis when hesaw a dentist extract a tooth after hypnotizing the patient and telling her thatshe would not bleed; to Miller’s astonishment, there was no bleeding. Bleedingis, of course, controlled by the involuntary nervous system, and cannot, in thenormal course of things, be affected by thinking. Yet here was evidence that thedentist’s “thought” could stop bleeding. Miller began to try hypnosis on variousailments—including cancer—and was astonished by its effectiveness. He concludedthat our major “control system” lies in the cerebral cortex: the thinking partof us. In effect, Miller had rediscovered the subjective and objective minds.Miller carried his thinking an important step beyond Hudson. If the cerebralcortex, the conscious ego, has the power to control the automatic nervoussystem, why do we fail to recognize this power? What stops us from curing ourown illnesses, whether headaches or cancer? Obviously, the main reason is thatwe never make the attempt. This is because we feel that consciousness counts forso little compared to the forces of the unconscious mind—the power of theemotions and the body. And this is not simply because Freud and D. H. Lawrencehave taught us to distrust the conscious ego. It is because our own experienceseems to support the notion that thought is helpless when compared to the forcesof the unconscious.The problem, says Miller, is that the conscious mind is unaware that it issupposed to be in control. The brain is like an enormous computer, overflowingwith activity that seems to be independent of the will. This is particularlyobvious during sleep, when all kinds of strange phantasmagoria swarm intoconsciousness. It is equally obvious if I get a tune stuck in my head and cannotget it out, or if I find myself thinking obsessively about something I wouldprefer to forget. The brain physiologist Wilder Penfield discovered that if hetouched an area in the temporal cortex—the seat of memory—with an electricprobe, the patient would relive experiences from his past life in cinematicdetail. The brain is a vast library. No wonder the conscious self feels like avisitor with only limited right of access.Yet this is a mistake, as we discover every time a crisis produces a flood ofconcentration and vitality, or when ecstasy brings a sense of control and power.In such moments, we suddenly realize that it is the “I” that is in control, not“it.”The “I” only achieves this recognition when galvanized by intensifiedconsciousness. Yet if it is a recognition, and not an illusion, then we shouldbe able to use this insight to reach unprecedented levels of self-control.Miller compares our situation to a man sitting idly in a cinema, watching ajumbled phantasmagoria on the screen, and wondering what has happened to theprojectionist. He is unaware that he is the projectionist. It takes a suddencrisis to wake him up, and make him realize that his proper place is in theprojection room, not yawning in the “audience.”What Miller is saying is that we must come to terms with this recognition thatthe “controlling ego” (which he calls “the unit of pure thought”) is intended tobe the director of both the conscious and the unconscious minds. As a species,we have slipped into the habit of regarding consciousness as somehow subservientto the body and the emotions. So that if I feel sick, or feel convulsed withjealousy, it seems self-evident that my ability to think is of no particularuse; on the contrary, it seems to make things worse by looking on detachedly andtelling me I oughtn’t to be such an idiot.Yet the moment I feel the need to turn my thought into action, the moment Ideterminedly search for solutions, I experience a sense of control, a surge ofpower and insight. The sensation is not unlike the surge of power and purposeproduced by the orgasm. And the more I become accustomed to these efforts ofcontrol, instead of lying down and surrendering to my emotions, the more I learnthat “I” am not a cork tossed about on a sea of feelings and sensations; I amthe director. In fact, if I study my perceptions—which seem to occur without myvolition—I realize that even they depend on a form of unconscious effort (whichthe philosopher Husserl called “intentionality”). If I look at my watch withoutpaying attention, I fail to grasp the time; my mind has to make an effort, likea hand grasping an object.It can be seen that the two minds of Hudson correspond to the two hemispheres ofthe brain—discussed in chapter 1—with the left brain as the objective mind, theright as the intuitive, subjective mind. So it would seem a reasonableassumption that they also correspond to the Huna notion of the “lower self” andthe “middle self”—the unconscious and conscious minds. Yet this proves to beinaccurate. In Enid Hoffman’s Huna: A Beginner’s Guide, a chapter is devoted tothe split brain, and, as expected, the “middle self” is placed in the leftcerebral cortex. But the “lower self,” according to the kahunas, is located inthe solar plexus.This is less surprising than it sounds; after all, D. H. Lawrence identified thesolar plexus as the center of intuition and emotion. And this is confirmed byself-observation. If some unpleasant thought enters my head—the left brain—Iexperience a “sinking feeling”—a leak—in the area of the solar plexus.And what of the right brain? This, according to Dr. Hoffman, is the seat of the“higher self.” And this, again, is supported by self-observation. In moods ofserenity produced by music or poetry—both of which make their appeal through theright brain—we experience a sense of expanding identity, or contact withpowerful vital forces. It is the right brain that is involved in mysticalecstasy, in the feeling that G. K. Chesterton calls “absurd good news.”So Huna philosophy has removed another of the puzzling contradictions of modernpsychology: the notion that the unconscious mind is the source of our best andworst impulses, of inspiration and anarchic violence. It anticipates AldousHuxley’s suggestion that if the mind has an unconscious “basement,” full ofrepressions and neuroses, it must also have a superconscious “attic.”The kahunas go considerably further than Howard Miller in defining the role ofthe “controlling ego.” The higher self, says Long, has control over the future,so that it is possible for us to direct the future, if we go about it in theright way. Long describes his own experience of visiting an old kahuna womanduring the Depression, when his camera shop in Honolulu was on the point ofbankruptcy.The healer told me that in her experience most people sent to the High Self acontinuous jumble of conflicting wishes, plans, fears and hopes. Each day andhour they changed their minds about what they wished to do or have happen. Asthe High Self makes for us our futures from our averaged thoughts which itcontacts during our sleep, our futures have become a hit-and-miss jumble ofevents and contrary events, of accidents and good and bad luck. Only the personwho decides what he wants and holds to his decision doggedly, working always inthat direction, can present to the High Self the proper thought forms from whichto build the future.The High Self, says Long, must be contacted through the intermediary of the lowself; the middle self cannot do it directly.Long claims that as a result of the kahuna’s advice—which she arrived at through“scrying” with a glass of water—she was able to tell him: “Your path is notbadly blocked,” and to give him precisely detailed instructions which showed anaccurate foreknowledge of the future, and which saved him from bankruptcy.All of which raises an obvious question: if the High Self knows the future, andis the “guardian angel,” why does it not do a better job of shaping ourdestinies? The answer is to be found in Howard Miller. Because the middle selfis the director, the controller, it is its job to contact the high self, notvice versa. It must do this by using its power of choice and rational analysis,by trying to grasp the insights of “moments of vision” and intensity, and livingby these, instead of by the impulses of the low self, which is still close tothe animal world. The kahunas say that only the middle self can sin, for it hasthe power of choice.It all sounds depressingly difficult. In fact, it is not; for we are alwaysreceiving flashes of insight, “glimpses.” Every time a spring morning brings asurge of “absurd good news,” every time we experience a sense of interest andabsorption that arouses a glow of sheer affirmation, we see the solution, andsee that it is astonishingly simple. (This is why every mystic has expressed afeeling that can only be translated: “Of course!”) The problem is that the lowself fails to grasp it, so that half an hour later we can no longer rememberwhat it was. The romantics of the nineteenth century died off like flies becausethey suspected the “moments of vision” were an illusion, and the basic truth isthat life is dull, brutish and short (Tennyson’s In Memoriam is a classicexpression of this anguish). Trained in kahuna teaching, they would haverecognized that this is a purely technical problem of communication between the“selves,” and that despair is due to an absurd misunderstanding.According to Long, Huna teachings originated in ancient Egypt and the Sahara, inthe days when the Sahara was still fertile. This original Huna people left in anexodus and spread in many directions; Long produces strong evidence that theBerber tribes of the Atlas mountains, in north Africa, spring from the samepeople. We may, of course, reject the whole notion that Huna is a secretknowledge system (Huna means secret), and regard it simply as a form ofintuitive psychology mixed with ancient superstition, in which the low, middleand high selves are simply aspects of the human psyche (corresponding roughly toFreud’s unconscious, conscious and superego). What must be acknowledged is that,as a psychological system, it has a depth that is lacking in most modernpsychologies.Our concern in this book is with the poltergeist and its mysteries; and here thekahuna explanation seems to fit the facts rather better than most. As GuyPlayfair points out, the kahunas seem to have explanations for most “psi”’phenomena. Before considering some of these explanations, let us look once moreat the “facts.”It is Playfair’s contention that, after fifteen hundred years of poltergeistobservation, and a century of psychical research, it is no longer true to saythat our position is one of complete ignorance. “If it were the mating habits ofcockroaches, there’d be quite enough evidence for someone to produce adefinitive paper in Nature.” In This House Is Haunted, he lists the nineteen orso “symptoms” of what he calls “the poltergeist syndrome,” beginning with rapsand ending with equipment failure of cameras, tape recorders and so on. Hepoints out that in some cases, only half a dozen of these appear—let us sayraps, overturning furniture, apports, “possession” and outbreaks of fire.You always get them in the same order. You don’t get puddles of water beforestone throwing, you don’t get fires before raps. So that there is a predictablebehavior pattern. They appear to be random to us, but they’re obeying some sortof rules that they understand even if we don’t.[3]What can we say about these rules?We can say there is a source of energy. There has to be, because physical workis being carried out, and since it’s being carried out in our space and ourdimension, then it has to obey at least some of the laws of mechanics.And he goes on to suggest that this energy source (the poltergeist) could becompared to a crowd of mischievous children who find a football in a field (someform of energy extruded from a “leaking” human being) and proceed to kick itaround, smashing a few windows in the process.The Brazilian novelist Chico Xavier, who claims that his novels come through“dictation” from “spirits,” states in one of his books (quoted by Playfair inThe Indefinite Boundary) that the source of this “energy plasma” is the pinealgland. This gland, a tiny grey mass like a slightly flattened pea, lies roughlyin the center of the brain, and seems to be a vestigial eye. In some creatures,like the Tuatera lizard of New Zealand, it is still a non-functioning eye. Oneof its chief purposes is the inhibiting of the sexual hormones—people with adamaged pineal show abnormal sexual development. There is some evidence that italso plays some role in the evolution of our higher functions; when the braincells are deprived of the chemical messenger serotonin (secreted by the pinealgland) we become incapable of rational thought. At puberty, according to Xavier,it ceases to be purely a controlling mechanism, and becomes a fountain ofenergy, an escape valve. It secretes “psychic hormones” that generate creativeenergy. These energies represent our “spiritual potential”; unfortunately, mostof us are inclined to misuse them for purely animal sensations. (De Sade wouldprobably be a good example of extreme misuse.) When a child suddenly acquiresthis new force, at the age of puberty, there is a need for a channel oroutlet—perhaps vigorous sporting or sexual activity. If this outlet is lacking,Playfair suggests, the energy will be available for “marauding entities to stealand put to their own purposes.” “Perhaps if Brazilian girls played hockey orlacrosse there would be fewer poltergeists in São Paulo.”The vital force involved seems to have some resemblance to electricity ormagnetism. This is what the Hunas call mana. And since the earth is covered withliving creatures and organism—it may even be regarded as a living organism initself—then it also, presumably, has a permanent supply of this force (whatStringer calls Tellurian force). This force may be said to have been discovered,as far as Europeans are concerned, by Mesmer, who also made the interestingdiscovery since forgotten by Western science—that it can be influenced bymagnets and by various metals. Half a century later, it was rediscovered byBaron Reichenbach, who called it “odic force.” According to the kahunas, this isthe force used by poltergeists. (It may even be involved in thatstill-unexplained phenomenon, spontaneous combustion, which seems to be largelyconfined to the old in the way that poltergeist phenomena are largely confinedto the young.) The poltergeist uses mana to solidify its own “shadowy body,” andso can act upon objects.Clearly, there is a great deal of this energy available: not just in children atpuberty, but in sexually frustrated adults, and even in the earth itself, whereit seems to be concentrated at certain points. (Presumably ancient peoples chosesuch points as sacred sites because they attracted spirits.) Mediums also seemto produce large quantities of this force—perhaps secreting it as a cow comes tosecrete milk. Under the controlled conditions of a séance, this force seems toreturn to its origin, like an electrical circuit; but mediums who are awakenedviolently seem to be drained of vitality, and often stunned, as if by anelectric shock. (It is another odd fact that very many successful mediums becomephysically large, as if to compensate for this draining effect; those who—likeHome—remain thin often seem to die young.)According to Long, each of man’s three “selves” possesses its own astral (or“shadowy”) body. He says: “[Mana] is electrical in its nature and shows strongmagnetic qualities. The invisible substance through which the vital force actsis called aka, or ‘shadowy body stuff.’ ” When Long considered the Huna word forthe lower self, unihipili, he was puzzled that it contained the root pili,meaning sticky. What was sticky, he later concluded, was the “shadowy body,”which sticks to anything we contact or see, like the glue on fly paper. Thisexplains how psychometry works: the “stickiness” transfers itself through touch,and can be “read” by a “paragnost.” This stickiness can be drawn out into long,fine threads, like spiderweb; and, according to the kahunas, these filaments arethe conductors of psychic force. Telepathy operates by means of these telephonewires of aka; people who have “out of the body” experiences remained connectedto the physical body by a cord of this substance.The “electrical” nature of mana also explains why so many poltergeists seem tobe associated with electrical forces. The clergyman in the Esther Cox case wasconvinced that her powers were basically electrical. And in the case of theRosenheim poltergeist, which occurred in a small town near Munich in themid-1960s, all the early manifestations were electrical: strip lights exploded,electrical apparatus failed to function, and even a one and a half volt batteryregistered three volts. The telephone registered enormous numbers of calls tothe “speaking clock”—far more per minute than could actually be dialed—and theinvestigator Hans Bender, realized that the poltergeist must be getting throughdirect to the relays. (This need not imply that the poltergeist understood thetelephone system; bursts of electrical energy could trip the relays.[4])It is also worth noting that one of the commonest delusions of mental patientsis that they are being subjected to persecution by electric shocks—which couldbe explained as an excess of unused mana.How does the poltergeist use this energy? Here again, scientific observation hasproduced a great deal of data. Objects are not thrown in the normal way, forthey can change direction in mid-air; they seem to be “carried” by thepoltergeist. (Diane Pritchard described to me her sensation of being somehowenveloped in the energy as the poltergeist dragged her upstairs.) Why thisshould be so is another of those “laws” of poltergeist phenomena which we canobserve, but for which we have no explanation. It may be that the poltergeistcannot convert this energy into the ordinary kinetic energy necessary forthrowing. And this, in turn, underlines Guy Playfair’s point that poltergeistsdo not seem to live in our “dimension.” This may explain how they can cause“interpenetration of matter”—like the Borley ghost, which caused bottles from ashed to hurtle into the hall through locked doors, or the “black monk” whoemptied eggs from a box when Jean Pritchard was sitting on the lid. This wholephenomenon is again connected with oddities for which we have no explanation.“Apports” are usually warm, and in many cases, objects that have been thrown areheavier than before they were thrown.Another oddity is that poltergeist noises do not seem to be normal sounds; whenanalyzed on a graph they show a “ramp function” which is unlike the “gradualcurve” of a normal sound of knuckles rapping on wood. They are like noisesmanufactured in an electronics lab. Yet there seems to be an “interface,” apoint of connection, between the “dimension” of the poltergeist and “our world”;when Bill Haylock spoke—in the Enfield case—he somehow used Janet’s vocal cords.We have also noted, in the course of this book, that poltergeists seem—to alimited extent—to be capable of “possessing” human beings. In a book called TheSupernatural in Cornwall, Michael Williams has described a case that took placeat St. Issey in 1941, when poltergeist disturbances began in a small cottageimmediately after the death of a baby girl. A nine-year-old boy—brother of thedead child—was suspected of causing some of the effects. The boy admitted thiswas so, but said that he had been somehow forced to get up from the settee andlift a table. A witness spied on the boy when he was alone in the living room,and saw him throw a tin can across the room—whereupon the tin rose of its ownaccord and flew back. But the local vicar was unconvinced, and accused the boyof causing all the phenomena. Convinced of his innocence, the boy’s mother tiedhis hands behind his back with a belt and sent him into the scullery; and, asthey watched through the door, they saw pots, pans and chairs dancing round theroom. When the boy was sent away, the phenomena ceased. Here it seems clear thatthe shock of his sister’s death caused the kind of “energy leak” that gave thepoltergeist its energy. But it was also able to force the boy to throw things.This should be borne in mind in considering Podmore’s comment that poltergeistsare usually children throwing things. No doubt this is often true; and in someof the cases, the child is unable to help it.This, then, seems to be the sum of what we know, and what we can deduce, aboutthe poltergeist. It is not, perhaps, a great deal; yet it is surely enough forus to assert that the poltergeist, like the duck-billed platypus, really exists,and that some of its habits have now been positively established.One interesting question still clamors for an answer. Why does the malice of thepoltergeist seem to be so distinctly limited? They could quite easily kill; yetthere is no recorded case in which they have done so. Heavy wardrobes misspeople by a fraction of an inch; fires break out in locked cupboards and drawersa few minutes before they are “accidentally” discovered. Is there some psychic“law” that prevents poltergeists from being more destructive? Or does the answerlie—as the kahunas declare—in the nature of the poltergeist itself? They assertthat a poltergeist is a “low spirit” that has somehow become separated from itsproper middle and high spirit. Unlike the middle spirit, it possesses memory;but it has only the most rudimentary powers of reason. It may be mischievous,but it is not evil. Only the middle spirit is capable of evil—of directed,murderous malice. So, according to the kahunas, the poltergeist is only capableof such malice when it is directed by a human magician.As usual, the conclusion seems to be that, where evil is concerned, human beingshave a monopoly.[1]. The King’s Cellars was later renamed Goody’s Bar. The manifestations havestopped.[2]. Fodor: The Haunted Mind, chapters 7 and 9.[3]. These comments come from a taped interview with Playfair.[4].
