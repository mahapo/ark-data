All originators in philosophy ale forced to rely on the second method (because so much of their work depends on intuition). that is why Plato, Hume, Berkeley, and Nietzsche are so much more readable than Aristotle, Kant, Hegel and Heidegger; they do not over- burden the text with too much definition, md they are in closer touch with the reader. Atistotle is certainly more precise than Plato, but it is difficult to imagine anyooe reading him for pleasure.

In the present book, definitions are not excluded, but they are kept to a minimum. I have made a gteat deal of use of inverted commas to indicate that words or Phrases are being .used in a certain limited sense (i.e. \"nature\", \"petrersiotl\", \"li[e-force\"), but have avoided circurnlocutions to make this Bense obvious. It might be convenient, therefore, if I sated at this point rome of the book's underlying assumPtions.

The second is: Iflhat is meant by \"rnan's total being\"? lFany kind of a satisfactory answer can be provided to the 6rst question, it may be possible to use it to shed light on the second. The most obvious staternent about the sexual impulse is that here is a point where rnan and \"nature\" have two di:fferent aims. 'fhJaim of nature aPpears to be procreation. The aim of the individual is to achieve the fullest possible satisfaction in the sex:al otgasm. It is tnre that man's Pu1Poses and nature's seldom coffes- pond exactly.

This is not sufficient fot most civilized mer; their interest in food goes beyond anything that aature requires; some are even capable of eating themselves to death. Still, on the whole, most men keep within the bounds of \"what nature requkes\". The same is true of the needs for drink, sleep and exercise. In the sexual impulse, the gap between rnan's purpose and natute's seems unusually wide.

GENERAL DTSCUSSTON OF SE}(UAT ABERRATTON tg are more perversions of the sexual urge than of any other human preservative impulse. But here, the first problem occurs. A perversion is usualty defined as \"arl unnatural act\". The word ..unnatural, is easy enough to understand when man feels a strong instinct foi what is natural. No one, for example, doubts that the eating of cxcreta is unnatural, since what has once been rejected by-the body can hardly provide nourishment for the body. But where latyre has se-parated its owfl puqposes from man,s as widely as ia the case of serq how are we to judge what is natural? Tokto!t Defnition of Nornalitl To some exteflt colnmon ser*e is helpful. The essence of the corlmon-sense view of sex was stated by Tolstoy in the novel Tbe Kre*ryr sonata. Basically, this is a kind of \\ifesleyan tracr against sexual licence. The wife murderer, Podsnichev, feels that modern society has plunged into a kind of sexual insanity. This is because the increase in leisure has given man far too much suqplus energy, which he uses in a feverish pursuit of pleasure. In the natural course of things, neither man nor wife !ry -._\".tgy for much sexual indulgence; she is worn out by childbearing, he by his d\"ily labour; his interest in sex is limited. But the aristocracy (pa*iculady the \"cultured\" aristo- ctacy) spend their days with thoughts of sex - which, in its more innocent stages, is disguised as romance. podsnichev's fedousy of his wife began when she played Beethoyen,s Ninth Sonata for piano and violin with a yborrg aristocrat; this kind of cultural dilettantism, Tolstoy implies, I only anotler excuse for relationships that can drift into adultery. Tolstoy concluded that the only 'onormal\" sex is sex directed rpccifically to producing children. All indulgence for pleasure - cvco between man and wife - is \"abnormal,,, i.e. somehow unnrtural. This view has at least the merit of consistency. It goes a stage bcyond St. Paul, and the teaching of the Cathoficthurch on bl*h control. It is, in fact, abasically religious view. It declares thtt men's ornrn inclinatioas have oo p\"tt in the definition of"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"20 ORIGINS OF TI{E SEK'AL IMPT'LSE \"normality\"; a \"higher\" view must be taken, even if it runs courrter to desires that men count as \"wholly natural\". There would be very few of us who would be prepared to go asfxas Tolstoy in defining what is o'normal\", Most wtiters on sex, from F.llis and Ktafit-Ebing onwatds, have been indined to define sexual notmality as \"any sexual activity that leads ultimately to the act of reproduction\". T'his view Produces cerAin contradictions. It sates that all sex is normal if eiaorla- tion finally takes place in the vzgina., no mattef what unusual practices may have led up to it. Consequently, a man who withdraws before he has an ofgasm, or who \\treafs a Pfeventa- tive, is mote \"abnormal\" than amarlwho likes to beat his wife to increase his sexual excitement, ot a. man who raPes a gtrl after knocking her unconscious. But the main obiection to the view is that it offends logic by defining abnormality in terms of the end 13tbet than the means. After all, the end of most sexual activity is an orgasm; surely it is the means by which it is procured that counts in iudging \"abnormality\"? The \"sexolo- !ist\" view of abnormality is a convenient srorking nrle, that ,pp.rts to be accruate only because most men who reach ao org\".rrr inside a woman achieve sexual excitement in the usual way. Gifu's Corydoa Gide, who made no secret of his pederasty, wrote four dialogues between a sexually \"normal\" tt rtatot and his homo- .\"=o\"l friend Corydon, in which he attempted a philosophical justification of homosexuality. But the book is more than an argument in favour of utanism. Gide himself said frequef,tly that he regarded it as his'most imPortant book, and he uras too intelligeni amzflto make such a statemeflt merely because the work justified one of his favourite indulgences. In fact, the questions it raises go fu beyond the qy9t19n of whether ho*ot\"*oality is \"natural\" or \"teptehensible\". Gide pointi out that, in animals, sexual attraction is usuall; due to tle smell of the female on heat. It might therefore be regarded as entfuely \"physical\" and natural. Even so, Gide GENERAL DISCUSSION OF SEXUAL ASERNATTON 2I contends, it would not be true to say that the male aoimal feels no sexual urge except when he smells oestnrm; most animals overflow with sexual desire, and may attempt to induce an orgasm by rnounting another male aniro\"l, oi nrbbing them- selves againstany convenienr object (the reg of a humai b.io& for example). Nevenheless, the odour of oestrum has the etr.ri of uniting and directing the animal,s sexual instincts. Man also overflows with sexual desire, but in his case there is no smell of oestrum to unite the instincts and direct them towards the ftmale at any particular moment. The stimulus that unites his instincts is purely mental. This is the reason for , the wide variatioos in the type of stimulus - in other words, fo1 '?!tr9rsior1s\". The \"notmel\" man is excited by the sighi of a naked woman; but he need not be particulady abnoriral if he prefers a very fat or a very skinny woman, or a middle- fge.d \"mothedy\"'ttrornan. He rnay not be especially abnormalif he is more excited by the sight of a woman in hei underweac, or a \\roman with long hair down her back. Gide zugues that therefore it is in no way abnormal for a man to prefer aboy, or another man. It is true that exclusively homosexual intercourse would not people the earth. But GidL trkes care to mention several cas.J of-\"manly\" homoseruals who- have produced families. He seems to imply that it would not be an undesirable state of affairs if every singre man and vornan had homosexual inclinations, provided they also did thcir duty of producing families. All this raises questions of immense interest and deep im- plication. I have suggested, in \"A Study of Murder,,, that the lcxual desites in children ar€ \"undifierentiated\"l that is to say, they are no more than the need for stimulation of the sexual mcmber, as simple as the desire for food. At an eady age, the mxual appetite is \"hypnotized', by some object, so tiat the obfect becomcs associated with sexual satisfaction. The obiect qory be some fetich - a crutch, a nightcap, an apron; it may be the child's own sexual parts or th6se oi rrrotli.r child of the Tm: cex. Luckily, for most men the .,object,, that hypnotizes tbo Imegination is the opposite sex."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"22 ORIGINS OF TIIE SE(UAL IMPI'LSE One basic fact should be noted here: that sexual desire, in its simplest form, is a drmand of tbe sexml organ, associated with it in exactly the same way that magnetism is associated with a magnet. The dif,erence is that the sexual organs might be com- pared rrrtber to an electromagnet, that may be either completely \"dead\" or magnetized. It is a kind of static electdcity of the sexual organ, which the organ wishes to discharge. !7e may know very little of the \"dynamo\" that ptoduces tle sexual electricity, but the electricity is undeniable. In discussing the part played by the imagination in sex, we should not lose sight of the real existence of this genuine physical component.. A man whose thoughts are a long way from sex may be sur- prised when the loins accidentally ptess against something and he feels a tingling as the \"electricity\" is discharged. At this stage it is possible to make only one clear genenhza- tion about the sexual instinct: that it works on a deeper level than any other human impulse - even, perhaps, that of self- preservation. On the whole, man can undetstand his tastes and desires. If he wants money, or social position, or fame, or even if his dominant urge is a desire to collect paintings or old books, he can trace the need back to its source, ffid under- stand how it became dominant in his scale of values. The sexual urge is the most difficult of all to assimilate into the consciousfless; arnarLmay think he understands it, and then be thrown completely off balance when it takes him by surprise. Shaw's Man and S*perrilan,for example, shows that even a man dominated by the need to be a wodd-reformer can be hurled, against all his bettet judgement, into sexual union with a womarl for whom he has little personal respect. As he embraces Ann, Tanner exclaims: r'The Life Force enchants me; I have. the whole wodd in my arms when I clasp you\", and \"The Life Force. I am in the grip of the Life Force.\" Romain Rolland makes the same point in Jean Cbristopbe, w&en he points out that Christophe's parents have nothing in colnmon, and that, in fact, the father has no idea of why he threw away a promis- ing carcer to marry a little servant gid: \"But what did that matter to the unknown force which had thrown him in with GENERAL DISCUSSION OF SEXUAL ABERRATION the little blonde servant? He had played his part . fathering a mafl of genius]. 2' \" [in But I have no wish, at this stage, erren to attempt to offer genetalizaions about n'evolutio n\"; allthat I wish to imphasize is the.actual poyer of the impulse, and its ability to override conscious checks. Hirschfeld cites an interesting case of a thirty-6v_e-year-old doctor, who had been subj.i to 6ts of somnambulism and epilepsy since childhood, and who was charged with committing an indecent sexual act with a thirteea-year-old-schoolgid. The doctor was treating the gid for eczema, which covered her whole body: \"He sat on the settee, drlwing the child's head down to him; furing this ac, her whole body approached his and induced in him serual excitement accompaniia uy an erection. He now pressed the child closer to himself. Olthe rest of his actions, the defendant had no clear recollection. rMhen he came to him- self, he was sitting on the settee, with the child, now in tears, standing berween his legs. . . . FIis mind did noi clear until he reached his flat. . . .\" . Dtrpg his \"blackout\", the doctor had induced an orgasm !l pbblng his sexual member against the child,s body. Hirsch- ftld mentions that the doctor-was greatly depressed at the time, and was in a state of exhaustioi do.'to oirerwork. At first riglt, it might seem that the blackout story, and the emphasis on his depression, are both lame atternpt io .*.rrr\" an act that was completely conscious. This *\"y, tf course, be so. But certain facts should be taken into account. The first is that human consciousness is peculiarly limited. Although all human beings have an imminse reservoir of memory, our actual a'wareness of the everyday world is relatively narrow and dull. For reasons best known to the evolutioniry force, man is not allowed access to his unconscious storehouse of lcnowledge and mer-nory, except on rare occasions. (Elsewhere, I have compared human consciousness to a horse that is blinkered in the t:,affic, because too much \"consciousness,, yo$d only hinder its efficiency.) Human beings wilfully limit thc,ir own consciousoess, for single-mindedoe\"ss and a'broad"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"24 oRrGrNS OF TtrE SE(UAL IMPTILSE consciousness are incompatible, dd most men fleed to b'e single-minded for survival. Now for the most part, *nature\" see*s to have no obiection when man dispenses with his sense of wonder and curiosity.

The sexual impulse is the favourite child of nature; no rnatter how great the demands on a man's energy, the sex impulse must have its share.* It is therefore intetesting to observe that many sexual crimes involving \"blackouts\" or unconttollable impulses are comrnit- ted by men in a state of exhaustion or depression.t And the claim that the conscious will could bteak down or be com- pletely dominated by the sudden emPtion of an urge ftom the iubconscious may not be summarily dismissed as an attempt to evade the consequences of the act.

GBI{ERAL DISCUSSION OF SEXUAL ABERRATION 2' human sexual impulses is purely mental or imaginative, d- though it is usually strongly tied to sensual impressions. (\") Of all human instincts and desires, the serud instinct is the one that most transcends men's consciotts awareness of him- self and his purposes. ft is almost as if man carried a \"separate Bclf\" around with him of which he is usually ignorant. Fftild and G*rdjief So far, no psychologist or philosopher has produced a uifying view of the pexual impulses. Freud's conttibution was mainly to emphasize that the sexual energy (which he called the libido) is one of the deepest and most powerful of man's subconscious forces. \\7'hen he 6rst made this statement - around the turn of the centu4r - it produced something of a furote, since the previous century had been an ^ge of social idealism, and aineteenth-ceatury man prefered to think that his deepest urges were of a more creditable nature - towards knowledge and social betterment, for example. Since theo, twentieth-century man has been far more aware of the sexual impulse, until he now sees it reflected around him in most of tfie activities of hib everyday life. Freudians would claim that poycho-analysis is pardy responsible for this increased aware- ness, but this is debatable. What is certain is that if no Freud had existed to assert the supremacy of the sexual impulse, the notion would have developed of itself out of the \"rnental climate\" of the twentieth century. Among modern philosophers, f can think of only one who , hes made any attempt at a unifying sex theory - George Cnrrdjieff. Even so, there is very little information on the rubiea in the writings of Gurdlieff's followers. Gurdjieffdeclared that man has seven \"centres\" t{rat control hig various functions. There is an instinctive ceotre, an intel- lcAual centre, an emotional centrc, a moving centre (which is concerned with the body's motions) and a sexual centre; there tlc also two \"higher centres'?. Each of these centres wotks on r diflerent kind of energy. Unfortunately, human beings tend to mif, up the energy of the various cefltres, and may use"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"zG oRrcrNS or rr{E sExuAL TMPULSE emotional enefgy to dtive the intellect, instinctive energy to drive the emoti,ons, intellectual of emotional energy to drive the sexual centre, and so on. And aPParently all the centtes tend to steal energy from the sexual centre, and use it for their owo pu{poses. (Gurdjieff would say that Robert.Irwin used his sexual enefgy to drive his intellect aod emotiofls.) fh\"I then ..give bacL;, useless energy of their o\\ilrn to the sexual centrer-so that the sexual cefltfe is frequendy forced to work on emotional, or even intellectual energy. Gurdiieff told Ouspensky: \"lt is a very grrzrt thing when tle sexual certre works with its own energY.\" Now these remarks on the \"Centfes\" may strike Some readerS as completely unscientific. In fact, Gurdiieff attempted to create, irot merely a philosophical system, but a religion; various rituals and dances were an important Paft of his \"system\", and there are also semi-mythological-statements that most people are inclined to take with a pit.! of sak. There is no \"sci^endhc evidence\" for the centres. And yet, whether Gurdfieff's general remarks on the centfes afe tflre or not, no ofle can deny that there is a feeling of truth about his state- ment that \"ii is a very great thing when the sex centre'srofks with its owfl enefgy\". And this, at least, is worth careful con- sideration.* No one, for example, who rcads Ladl Cbatterlel's Lwr, can doubt that part of the motive Power of the book is Lawrence's feeling of iocial undeqprivilegi, and that he identifies himself with tlhe gamekeeper who makes love to a \"lady\".-These social feelings ire not only emotional; they are negatiae$ emotional. 1Curd1ietr declares that the negative emotions - fea4 hatred, disgust - afe completely,useless in the economy of the \"human maihine\", mere excreta.) The sexual emotion of the book is consequently imPure. In the same way, flo one can read the memoirs of casanova without becoming awar:e of the Same irnpurity of motive. For *A brief account of Gurdiieff's ideas will be found it my Oatsi&r, pp. 267-7o.

I can think of none; and the reasofl may be that when sex is written about, it is mixed with the energy of the intellectual or emotional centre. The true sexual energies make a self-enclosed circuit; the man who experienced this circuit would feel no urge to write about it. There are, how- cver, a few interesting examples that seem to come close to describing the sexual cefltre working with its own energy. The work of Aldous Huxley contains several of these. His novel Antic Ha1 is concerned largely with describing \"inauthentic\" senral encounters, wanton promiscrrity that is basically futile and unsatisfying; but there is, by contrast, one single com- pletgly \"satisfying\" encounter. Gumbril is having an innoceot affair with a gid named Emily, with whom he is in love. After t concett when the music leaves them both feeling emotionally cleansed, they go to bed together: \"V\"\"y gently, he began caressing her shoulder, her long olcnder arm, dtawing his finger tips lightly and slowly over her cmooth skin; slowly, froar her neck, over her shoulder, Iingeringly round the elbow to her hand. . . . Through the silk of her shift, he leatned her curving side, her smooth straight beck and the ddges of her spine. . . . Under the smock, he learned her warm body, lightly, slowly caressing. He knew her, hie fingers, he felt, gould build her up, a werm and curving ttrtue in the darkness. He did not desire her; to desire would hrve been to break the enchantment. He let himself sink deeper and deeper into his dark stupor of happiness. She was Uleep in his arms; and soon, he too was asleep.\" *Scc Chapter II."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"28 ORIGINS OF TT{E Sru(UAL IMPT,LSE This lyrical, almost mystical description of senral emotion is intetestingly unlike the usual sexual encounters in Huxley; more typical is one in Point Cotnter Poiat, described by Lucy Tantamount in a letter tolTalter; she uplains how she picked up an Italian and drove with him to a hotel: \"He came at me as though be were going to kill mq with clenched teeth. I shut my eyes, like a Christian maf,tyr in front of a lion. Martyrdom's exciting. Letting oneself be hurt, humiliated, used like a doormat - queer. I like it. . . .

I dug my nails into his arm so that the blood came. . . .\" In Tbe Genias and Tbe Godfuss there is another description that is evidently supposed to invoke the perfect sexual en- counter, but this time it is largely vetbalized: \"That night of the twenty-third of April, we urere in the Other World, she and I, in the dark, wordless heaven of nakedness and touch and fusion. And what revelations in that heaven, what Pente- costsl The visitations of her catesses 'v/ere like sudden angels . , .\" etc. In this case, the intercourse is completed; but its description is less convincing than the descriptiontn,4ntic Ha1 where the t'wo fall asleep. In the Appendix of Adonis and tbe Alpbabet,* Huxley raises an interesting question that throws some light on the scene in Antic Hal.Hewrites about Joho Humphrey Noyes, the foun- der of the Oneida Community in the United Sates, and of Noyes' theories of o'male cofltinence\". Noyles' Oneida Com- munity ril/as an expedment in what he called \"Bible com- muoism\", a simple \"share-afld-share-alike\" commurrity, whose most cutious featrue was its senral communism. Noyes believed that the exclusive possession of one man by one woman is evil; in the Oneida community, uromen were com- munal. This could have led to some embartassments - fot example, the perpetual pregnancy of most of the womeo. To *Cdled ia Amedca Toaot'ttp and Tomomnt and Tomoron. GENERAL DTSCUSSTON OF SEXUAL ABERRATTON 2g Jvercome this, Noyes advocated the system of karcqa (..the idea that the amative functions of the senral organs tb\"ia u. sepatated from -the propagative\"); the man should simply restrain himself from reaching an orgasm. This, Noyes claim- ed, was far more s-atisfying tlan the usual sex, curminating in 1l orgasm. His aims in the community were \"perfectioiist christianity\" aod the propagation of the idea of the karerya and complex marriage. High claims have been made for the method of kareqaby its various devotees; certain writers have taken it even fuitt \", t3\" N:y.\"s,-suggesting that a newly married couple should allow their desires to reach a point of high tensidn without reaching. the stage of copulation. !flhen, afier a rong period of preparation, the male frnally inserts into the femaje - but without permitting himself any movement that might lead to grgasm - it is asserted that the couple will experience an intensity of semal emotion beyond anytuing oLtainable in ordinary sexual intercourse; one description dJclares that they may errefl e4pedence a sensatioa of hovering in ttre air. It is obvious that Huxley was describing sometrhing very like this ra Antic Hay and the approval'with which he ipeaks of tle karytrry in the appendix o{ eaox;s and tlte Atpbabet may confrrr this. , -.It seems,possible, then, that Noyes had hit upon a method of $l*i\"g the sexual centre to work with its ourn eflergy. The insisteace upon perfect relaxation, upon complete contol of the desiie to reach orgasm, would iazure that the sexual ener- gies are unadulterated by the energy of the emotional or intel- lcctual centre. The sexual act, unleis led up to by a long pedod of anticipation, is almost certain to be involved with embtions rnd thoughts connected with other matters. The length of time involved in the kareqa would allow the sexual energy to ttryl py.l\", to separate itiilf from other types of energy.

Generally speaking, it may be said that the basic activity of all lioiog organisms is the discharging of various forms of tension, and that the act of discharge leads to a temporury \"broadening\" of conscious- ness. A starving mafl, for example, feels a physical tension which is discharged by the a* of eating; and the discharge of the tension is accompanied by a sense of afrrnation of \"life\". This affitmation would not be expetienced in the same degree if the man fed at nro-houdy intervals, allowing no time for the tension of hunger to build up. Tensions may be released in various ways and on various levels: physically, by eating, drinking, smoking a cigatette; crnotionally, by listening to music, seeing a film, reading a romantic novel; intellectually, by doing mathematics or a cross- word puzzle. All games aimatreleasing tension by a process of building it up and allowing it to relax again (but it should be noticed that a game that teleased only the tension that it built up would be a bad game; its act of release should also involve emotions that were qffeleased before the game b.gro). Some of these releases iavolve only a soothing of the nerves; others may involve a definite heighteniag of consciousness. I have pointed out elsewhere that it is relatively easy to achieve \"heightened ctinsciousness\" through the body - tbrough sex or other forms of physical relief; it is fairly easy to achieve it through the emotions. The most difficult to achieve is heightened intellectual consciousness. Most meo have been \"carried out of themselves\" by the sexual orgasm; alatgeper- centage have experienced release through strong emotion; the aumber who have known the iatensity of an r?instein or a GENERAL DISCUSSION OF.SEXT'AL ABERRATION 3' Newton must be very small indeed. - And yet this need for release, for heightened consciousoess, is one of the most basic human strivings. The inference to be drawn froar this is that, whatever the oltimate pu{poses of the evolutionary force that drives tnan, heightened consciousness surely glays some important part irl tiem? Eliot may wdte gloomily that human life agpgars to have oo other meaning than \"birth, copulation, and death\", but he is'leaving out o? accouflt the equally basic faaor of the need for a more intense consciousress that dominates aII hunran activity. The strange thing is that we never take this need of ours inio account; s/e regard it as an uaimportant fteak in human activity. No man wakes in the morning and wonders: \"Shall I have a moment of heighteaed consciousness today?\" He thinks only of what has to be done, aot of the state of consciousness thai will accom- p.ry $e $o-ing. If |e is a working man, tied to a routine fob that afiords him little personal satisfaction, he may occasionally feel that life is completely futile. \"I work to eat and I .\"t to Irpp \"p my strength to work.\" He would not dream of taking into account the occasional moments of \"e4pansiveness\" thi might come to him over a pint of beer, or because it is a pleasant splng day, or for no ieason at all.

It satisfies both man's purpose and nature's. Before leaving this point, it is instructive to compare the following thgee quotations: \"An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but indivi- dual, detached, with no suggestion of its origrn. And at once, the vicissitudes of life'had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory - this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me'with a precious essence; or rather, this essence was not in rne, it was myself.

Ifith the deep hot sweetness thus edtablished and'well on its u/ay to the ultimate coavulsion, I felt I could slow down in order to prolong the glow.\" The first of these descriptions is from Proust; it is Marcel speaking of the strange moment of \"remembrarlce of things past\" brought about by the taste of a calce soaked in tea. The second is from Hesse's Steppenwolf, describing a moment of release that comes through &inking a glass of wine. The third is from Nabokov's l-olita, and occurs in the passage where Humbert cautiously masturbates by rubbing his erect penis GENERAL DISCUSSION OF SEXUAL ABERRATION ,, against Lolita (who is unaware of what is going on). The similarity in the language is striking. It might be emphasized by a second quotation from Steppenwolf, this time describing an extension of consciousness due to erotic ecstasy: \"Now, at the magic touch of Eros, the source of [memory] \\ras opened up and flowed in plenty. For moments together my heat stood still between delight and sotrow to find how rich was the gallery of my life, and how thronged the soul of the wretched Steppenwolf with high etemal stats and constel- lations.\" It is true that the affirrrratton of the sexual impulse need not communicate itself to the intellect in this rnray, or even to the cmotions; it may be no more than a physical vrarmth and relaxation. But it should be botne in mind that such experien- ces as the one described above can be counted among the highest type of sexual experience. D. H. Lawrence and Sodonl The passage from Nabokov raises again the basic question ebout ooabnormality\", as does the whole of l-otita. If the highest kind of sexual experience can be gained by such a means, is it possible to call the means \"inauthentic\"? This questioa opens up the whole problem of \"sexual abetation\". Here again it is instructive to consider cases. D. H. Lawrence is normally regatded as the high-priest of a mystical sexual \"normality\". And yet ProfessorWjlson Knight has pointed out, in a brilliant essay, that Lawrence placed a gfeat deal of emphasis on the act of sodomy .In Ladl Cltatteile/s L,oaer most of the early sexual encounters are \"flormal\". Iiut towards the end of Chapter r'6, Mellors takes Constance Chat- htley \"in the Italian rnanner\". Lawrence is careful not to be Iao explicit, but a number of eady references in the book lead up to the final act. She is \"a little frightened, but let him have hlt way\", and the sensuality burns out \"the shames, the deepest, oldest shames, in the most secret places\", and the rcnsual fame \"pressed through her bowels and breast\".

Io the_same way, do*ru in Lan leads up to a strange scene between Utsula and Birkin (in the chapter \"Excurse\") where the exact plyti:a details a(e vague, excePt that Ursula kneels in front of Birkin, and causes him to reach orgasm by exploring with her fingers at .,the back of the loins\" to \"the quick of the mystery of dark- r1ess\".

Lawrenie's meaning is undedined in a poem, \"Mani- festo\", whete he writes: \"I want het to touch me at last, ah, on the root and quick of mydarkness....\" -Bitkirr\" act of sodomy with Utsu1a is also described in terms of the \"root of her darkness\". Professor lfilson Knight makes it vety clear that Lawtence attached gfeat importance to this final act, and he offers full documentatioa in his essaY.* It is tme that there is no need to seek complicated psycho' logical explanations for a phepomenon that might well have a pf,ysical basis. The anal regions, after all,'share some of the irotic sensitivity of the genitals. Professor Knight failed to note the Passage in M{s. Bloom's monologue wherg she men- tions that her lover \"made me spend the znd time tickling me behind with his finger\" and describes the intensity of her sexual satisfaction. Hirschfeld mentions two sister prostitutes who speciahzed in petforming an act of simultaneous genital and anal stimulation on their clients. HirscMeld adds: \"Accotd- ing to Freud, the evacuation of the bowels and the passing of *\"Lawtence, Joyce and Powys\", Essolls in Critichm, Oct' 196r' - GENERAL DTSCUSSTON OF SEXTTAL ABERRATTON 3t uritre is also accompanied by similar pleasurable sensatiofls\", but he points out that certain peoples do not practise kissing, and that thetefore the lips ate not included among the \"ero- gen€ous zones\" by these peoples. Hirschfeld also mentions a prostitarte who sometimes perfotmed fellatic on her customers while inserting a silk handlcetchief into the rectum, md with- drawing the handkerchief at the moment of otgasm; she claimed that this produced an intensity of sexual experience beyond \"flormal intercourse\". It is therefore hardly necessary to speculate how Lawrence?s \"nor[nal\" sexuality managed to drift towards anal eroticism. ffilson Knight even cites passages from Powys's Glastonbwl \\omance to atgue a connection between the anal rcgions and mystical ecstasy.) No one who has rcadlYoruen in Lou ot Ladl Cbatterlels l-ouer with sympathy can fail to regard the \"anal lccnes\" as a more-or-less logical development of what pte- ceded them. No doubt it would have seemed equally logical if thc act had been one of mutual oral stimulation. One must say, thcn, either that these n'consurnmations\" &re \"normal\", of that Lawrence's sexual mysticism is somehow basically atfnilt. I rm not at present concerned to argue either viev; only to point out that the bordedine between apparent normality and \"tbnormality\" is very thin. On the other hand, a case cited by Paul de River in his Volume Tlte Sexual Crininel (Chapter Six) is insttuctive. De Rlver writes of a motooic school guard who murdered three lmall gids (whose ages ranged between seven and nine) and Gommitted acts of sodomy and of \"norulal\" intercourse on all tlree. The school guard was martied but he had developed an obressional feeling that only the tight vagina of a child could brlng him the deepest sexual satisfaction. Having lured the dildten to a secluded spot with a promise to show them ilbbits, he took them away one by one and strangled them, gOmmitting a double act of violatioa upofl two of them. But Uhen questioned afterwards, he admitted that he had experien- gd the greatest pleasure with the elder of the three. Here the Fnfiuion of his desires becomes apparent. He imagiaes that"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":",6 oRrGrNs oF THE sExuAL TMPTILSE he can achieve the deepest satisfaction only with a very young girl, but in fact, he prefers the child urho is nearest to womafl- hood. At ftst sight, the case might be used as ao argument against the idea that the deepest sexual consummation should be putsued as an aim in itse[ but the man's confusion spoils the argument, proving that he had no idea of what he really wanted. In fact, the case is rather a suPPort of Lawrence's view that certain developments of the normal act, of sexud intercourse ate not \"unnatutal\". The guard's \"uflnatutalness\" arose out of his confusion, his misreading of his desites. There is no such confusion in Lawtence; even his opponents have to admit that there is a powerful interiot logic in the development of his sexual mysticism However, this iuxtaPosition of Lawrence and Paul de River's school guatd makes it apparent that Tolstoy's theory of sex is the only one that.offers a consistent statement about abnormality. Lawrence and the caretaker mzy be two extremes, but there is only a difference in degree; both felt that sex \"ought\" to lead to some ultimately satisfying consummation, beyond the bare act of \"natural intetcourse\". This view, it should be noted, is implicit in out attitude'of increased tolerance towards books dealing with sex. ![hen such books as lJlltses, Tbe lWell of l-onelincss, Lolita, Lob Cltatterlels Lour, can be openly published, it means that we are willing to accePt that the acts they describe are not wholly \"uor:atura1\". Tolstoy would have condemned them all, as he condemned Maupassant's Bel Ani, as \"dirty books\"l for by his definition, any kind of emphasis oo the pleasure of sex is \"abnormal\". By this standatd, Ladl Cltatterle.y's l-oaer is as abnormal as Tbe Vell of l-oneliness or Angus lWilson's Hemlock and After. And yet there ate few of us who can accePt Tolstoy's view as a solution. Tolstoy would imply that, if one day human- kind reaches a stage of god-like perfectiotL sex will have dis- appeared, except as an occasional act of\"duty\" (to reproduce). Ii is difficult to feel that Tolstoy has arrived at a balanced vision of the part played by sex in man's total being.

A coxvrNrENr starting point for the discussion of \"abnormality\" is the question of how far promiscuity is un- natural. Tolstoy certainly regarded it as a sexual disorder, as reprehensible, if flot as rare, as bestiality,or sadism. I have akeady commented that Gurdjieff's vierx, of the \"sexual centre\" seems to imply a one-man one-woman view of \"natural sex\", not unlike Lawtence's. But it is an interesting fact that Gurdjieff,liimself was known as something of a Don Juan. In God is m.y Aduenture, Rom Landau mentions the stories about Gurdjieff's \"immoralitf'with his female disciples; he goes on to tell a st.ory about a woman who was sitting in a restaurant when she experienced suddenly an intense sensual excitement, as if someone had \"pierced her sexual centre\"; looking round, she found that Gurdjieffwas sitting with his eyes fixed on her.* Whether or not Gurdjieff possessed this curious power of stimulating a woman at a distance, the Don Juan legends about him undoubtedly have their basis in fad., and several of his illegitimate children are alive in America.t The contradiction implied here is of gteatinterest.'Gutdjieff made several statements about the sex centre. It is the highest of the five centres, and works with a finer energy. There are . *Many of the stories about Gurdjieff credit him with strange psychic porpers, and Ouspensky declates that he had personal expetience of Gurdjieff's telepathic abilities. (In Searcb of tbe Miraculous, pp. z6z et seq.) fThis was probably one of the reasons why Lawrence decided against becoming Gudjieff's pupil at Fondainebleau. 38 pRoMrscurTy AND TIIE CASANOVA TMPULSE 39 only two other centres above it: the \"higher emotional\" and \"higher thinking\" centre; and the higher emotional centre \\il/orks with the same energy as the sex centre, implying that it is on the same level. Gurdjieff's main interest was the study of the \"human machine\" and its workings, and he concluded that the \"human factory\" is planned fot a very large output, but that it nevet reaches more tban a fraction of \"full production\" because human beings are shoft-sightedly interested only in their own needs and desires, ahd never explore their potentialities. To cxpress it by a different simile, one might say that the human machine is like a four-engined aeroplane which never flies on more than one engine. Admittedln the sexual orgasm often brings mala a feeling of great power - as if all four engines began to work momentarily - but it vanishes in a few seconds. Gurdjieff also maintains that the states of o'higher conscious- ness\" experienced by the mystics are the result of the working of the two \"higher centres\"l but most human beings qpend their lives completely unaware that they possess higher cefltres. S7hether we are inclined to accept Gurdjieff's psychology or not, it cannot be denied that human beings experience oc- casional moments of \"insight\", of certitude and confidence rbout \"life\" in general, that imply that our normal state of everyday consciousness is a poor, barren half-ration. This makes an excellent starting point for the study of sex. But now the coatradiction in Gurdjieff's views becomes fpgent, \"Normality\" meaas the senral centre wprking \"euthentically\" with its own energy. This brings to mind a vicion of some ideal, Lawrencian relationship in which a man tnd woman are somehow perfectly satisfying to one another.' On the other hand, 'oabnormality\" begins when one partner regards the other as a mere passive inJrument of pleaiure; it Crn lead to the type of sex murder described by Paul de River. But this impersonality lies at the root of Don Juanism. It is hrrd to imagine a perfectly balanced man - strong, un-neurotic, porsessing a\"teal\" @ntre of gravity, a deep knowledge of his o$rn being, an \"esseotial\" personality - pursuing a career of"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"40 ORTGINS OF TrrE SEXUAL IMPULSE enthusiastic seduction. Either Gurdjieff's view of the sex centre is more paradoxical than it appears to be, or hewas alessinte grated personality than he pretended to be. The second ques- tion is hardly relevant in this context; but the first is worth keeping in mind. The urge to sexual promiscuity is genenJly rcgarded as a disease when it reaches a certain point of \"loss of control,,; in women, this point is called nymphomania, in men, satyriasis. Sexologists have pointed out that nymphomania is frequently due to \"frigidity\" in women; because the woman fails to gain any deep satisfaction from the sexual experience, she tends to rcpeut it as often as possible in an attempt to achieve satisfac- tion. The records to which I have been given access in pre- paring this book included the following interesting case: \"X, a man in his eady twenties, had experienced a nervous breakdown after living for six months with a gid whom he claimed to be a nymphomaniac. The woman,'who was Jewish, and worked as a journalist, was several years his senior. She was not only incapable of fidelity to X, but appeared to take pleasure in freely describing her infidelities to him. She seemed to feel that.he ought to experience a vicarious pleasure in Iistening to her descriptions, and often became sexually excited as she dwelt on the details. X remembered pa*iculatly an experience she claimed to have had ^taparty. She had gone into an empty cloakroom to get her coat; there, she bent down to adjust her suspender. As she was doing so, a man entered the room behind her and stood watching her. She could see only his ttousers and shoes, with her back to him. After a few moments, the man raised her dtess from behind, and inserted his penis. He reached, orgasm, and then left the cloakroom without speaking to her. She thought he was drunk. During all this time, sbe had not laoked at bis face, arrd vras sure she would be unable to recognize him if she met him again.\" Here it is obvious that the girl took pleasure in the anonymi- ty of the encounter. Her bending position emphasized her animality; the man $ras as anonymous as a stray dog. It is observable that in this case the girl did uot mgntion PROMISCUITY 3ND THE CASANOVA IMPT'LSE 4t whether she experienced an orgasm; it seems probable that , she did not, and that she conformed to the patlern of \"frigid nymphomaniacs\". 'r It would be a mistake, though, to regard all nymphomaniacs as slow to reach orgasm. Mf. Rexroth, the American poet, has ': related a case that disproves the idea. The gid in guestioF was i arrested and charged with prostitution; the poli..i.r. unable ''k1 to prove their case because the girl never took money for her i services, and she came before a psychiatric board, of which Mr. , Rexroth was a member. She told how, on the day she was : married, she and her husband spent several hours in bed in a hotel room on Park Avenue. Immediately after this, she went out and allowed herself to be \"picked rp\" by a man in Central Park; she accompanied him to a hotel room, and intercourse took place. She picked up several more meu before she returo- ed to her husband. Later, when her husband,was at work, she ' made a habit of going to bed with strangers picked up on the stfeets. Her last client was a detective who \"ftamed\" her by putting marked money into her handbag and then arresting her. :'- The board asked her if her original experience with her ,husband was so unsatisfactory that she felt impelled to seek satisfaction elsewhere. She replied: \"Oh no. I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to do it agaia immediately.\" She insisted ,, that she experienced an orgasm with every man, and was completely satisfied, but that the desire would re-fotm an hour later. The board regarded her as an unusual case of insatiable sexual appetite. ,r Both these cases emphasize the element of inpernnalitl which seems to be so important in sex. Thomas Mann discusses this in his novel Doktor Falstttt. After the marriage of his ' Bister, Adrian Leverkuhn talks about \"the domestiiation of Bex\" by the Church. The relation between lovers is based upon r Strangeness; therefore, it is hardly accurate to say that \"these ' twain shall be one flesh\", for this would be the end of strange- , ness. Leverkuhn argues that the lust of one flesh for another is not mere seosuality, but love, for \"the flesh is normally in-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"42 ORIGINS OF TIIE SEXUAL IMPT'LSE PROMISCI'ITY AND TI{E CASANOVA IMPI'LSE 4' offensive to itself only. with another's it will have nothing to do.\" The breakdown of this resistance in sexual union Is a phenomenon \"for which sensuality is only an empty word,,. Mann has here touched upon an important and profound problem. But it should be observed that the resistanci to alien flesh is part of civilized conditioning. It is the civilized maa who cannot eat off someone else's plate or weaf somebody else's trousers. Babies and animals are usually indifferent to such questions. The more civilized a man becomes, the more his basic response to other human beings is the noli me tangere - don't touch me - that Lawrence rilras so fond of quoting. aThe more things a man is ashamed of, the more respectable he is,,; says Shaw's Tanner. One ofthe most basic of the ..psychologic- al horrors\" in Orwell's Nineteen EiglrtJ-fottr is the idea of men being continually. observed, everi on- the lavatory.* When Joyce's Ulltseswas first published, nffiI people found that one of its most disgusting passages is the one in which Mrs Bloom spits chewed seed cake into her husband's mouth in an act of love-making. AII this suggests an important idea: that civilizationcondi- tions us to a dislike of the alien \"other\" flesh, and that sex is an important act of de-conditioning. M*y children and adoles- cents find the idea of sex disgusting, and this disgust later becomes an important part of its fascination. A simple act Iike kissing with the tongue seems at oace nauseating and desirable, a symbol of ttre strange, poisonous, md shocking wodd of sex. So at an eaily stage sex is associated with the idea of violating one's natural fastidiousness, the desire lot7to be ..touched,! the dislike of dirt and of alien flesh. The stronger this fasti- diousness, the more sex is likely to be associated with ..sirl,,. This idea must be brou,ght up later, patticulady in the discus- sion of sadism.f *In Russia,I noticed that many public lavatories are mere boatds with holes in them, where men squat side by side, their trousers atound tleir ankles. flt might be noted here that the need for \"alien-ness', - the illusion of the inviolability of the othet petson, upon which all sexr:al desire depends - has ao iatetesting ertreme io the abnormality koown as .iauto- It seems probable, then, that-many c^a$e.s of nymphomania irrooto\" a r&olt against civilized conditioning; this seems Par- ,i\"Jrrry obvious in the case of the,gidwho allowedJrerself to i\" ..or\"d,, as she bent down to adiust her suspender.

I am not asserting that they are necessarily untrue; in fact,I would guess that Casanova was a curiously truthful man.*This only makes the Memairs aurreven more interesting study for the sexual psychologist. Casanova's first love affair occurred in his teefls, but his first sexual experience is not with one w'oman, but with two; he sleeps between the sisters, and takes the maidenhood of both within half an hour. A few chapters later, he repeats this feat - with another pair of sisters, of course (Vol. r, Chapter Ten).In the third volume occurs at affak that is completely typical of Casanoval ata card,putty he sits by the 6re, talkingto a youag girl who is recently out of a convent. The talk turfls to sex, and Casanova shocks her by showing her his sexual member. He then takes hold of her hand, and uses it to masturbate himself. Later, upon a promise of mardage, the gid becomes his mis- ffess. It is typical of Casanova that he carurot even remember her Christian narne, and refers to her as \"Mlle. de Ia Meure\". This e:rample illustrates as well as any the \"wish-ful-filment\" aspect of Casanova - the stories that sound as if they had been invented solely to get an advance out of some publisher of pornoguphic literature. (In fact, the Memoir.r vrere never published in Casanova's lifetime, or eveo 6nished.) Casanova is very seldom scorned by the'$romen upon whom his choice falls. ![hea this actually happens (Vol. 3, Chapter Six) Casanova resorts to cur:ning. The gid has taken another lover, who impregnates her. She approaches Casanova to ask his help in procuring an abortion. Casanova persuades her of the efHcacy of a cettain specifi.c, mixed with fresh semen, aod offers his help in the \"operatioo\". The gullible girl actually allows him to possess her several times in the couise of per- forming the experiment. She is finally forced to go into a coa- vent to have the baby. In the coutse of the same volume, Casanova sr.tcceeds in taking the maidenhead of a young married rromafl (whose husband is either shy or impotent), *All refereoces that follow arc to the Elek editioa of the luleaoirs, in Arthur lvlacheo's tmnslation, 6 vols., 1959-6o.

Cultured society might throw them into the psychological attitude of the liar, but as successful lovers they could feel themselves supermen. Significantly enough, both ended their lives in poverty and bitterness. Casanova fio\"lly returned to Veaice (from which he had fed many years before) as a spy and political iaformer. He died at Dux in Poland, as the librarian of Count $Taldstein. He spent his last years writing Menoir.r, resenting imagined insults, and mourn- ing for the passing of the \"age of chevaliers\". The younger generation regarded him as a quaint old man, completely out of date. Harris also died in poverty and obscurity in the south of France.

He had been ro a public school, then to Sandhurst, but had only spent two yearsln the **y, having decided to go into his father's business. He was good looking and athletically built, md a havy drinket. He enioyed playing with revolvers, frequently talked of his arrrry experiences (when he had been a member of the occupation forces in Germany) and oftea said that he wished the Russians would start a war so that he could fight. He thought that peace- time was demoralizing, and had the typical atmy officert con- tempt of civilians, regarding them as sloppy and undisciplined. He held a kind of mystique of power, which emerged con- stantly in his conversation - especially when drunk - and admired Hitler as a 'strong man'. In spite of his talk about physical violence and discipline, he was by no means un- intelligent; his bookshelf showed a wide rungeofinterests, and when I engaged with him in atguments or discussions, the acuteness of his reasoning powers often surprised me.

But all this emerged most cleady in his attitude to sex. His experience with women has been very wide, and he claim- ed that the number of women he had slept with was equal to the number of months that had passed since his fouteenth birthday (roughly r4o). These included two mistresses whom he had supported in Germany. M had many theories and beliefs about sex. For example, he oftenclaimed that he found masturbation more satisfactory than intercourse with a'sroman because 'it could be controlled more exacdy'.

He struck me as peiman.ntly unsatisfied, and often left his father's firm to take other jobs.

Because they arc reco.rnted in the third per- son, it is possible to gain afranket and less biased insight tian ia the cases of Casanova, Miller and Harris, who miy take a very different view of themselves from that of their contem- poraries. Here it can be seen plainly that the intense interest in sex is a substitute for other creative outlets. There is the physical eoergy and strength, and an attitude towards war and other forms of aggression that might be inaccurately called"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"t7 t6 Nietzschean. But it is also aFl)arent that the usual outlets of the physically healthy man - sports, strenuous hobbies - are not able to satisfy him. His social background ensures that his various employments should not involve too much physical effort; but he might be happier as acoal miner at afarm irand. His \"mystique of power\" demands an outlet, and finds it in the urge to dominate other men, and in sexual \"feats',. In fact, the absorption in sex and the aggressiveness are the only available outlets for the will to pourer. \"M's\" character could hatdly be called \"abnormal,,, but it is of great interest because it lies on the threshold of the ab- normal. And it can be seen that here is a case of a man who is ry1 we! adapted for life in mid-rwentieth-century Europe, although he might have made a highly satisfactor y cureerin ihe army two hundred years ago. Like Casanova, Hards aad Miller, he finds it difficult to discover a place for himself ia society; but the profession of \"adventure\" is not open to man in our time, and he is forced to accept poor suLstitutes in becoming a policeman, whaler, etc. Unlike Casanova, he has no criminal leaning - this would not accord with his desire for leadership and hii aggressiveness - but neither has he, ap- parentlyr any cteative bent. He possesses great energy, and his lack of creative outlets forces most of it into the channel of his interest in sex. The episode with the officer and the nympho- maniac ptovides outlet for both his chief urges: the developed sexual interest and the aggression towards other men. seiual encountefs involving more than two paftnefs are sometimes tefeled to as \"pluralism\" by psychologists, and it is frequently cited as a minor perversion; it can therefore be seen thatfin this case, the \"perversiofr\" is a simple result of the frustration of creative energy. There is a final interesting footaote to the case of ..M,r; al- though it may seem to have fitde relevaace to the problems of sex, its significance will appear later in the discussion of \"exis- tential values\". Apropos (6M's\" will to po.til/er, the author of the manuscript adds:- \"'W'e argued one day about his wholly physical attitude PROMISCUITY AND THE CASANOVA IMPULSE towards life. I objected to the repetitiveness of his expetience, rnd said that a hundred experienqes of sex could teach you no more than ooe. He said this was not true - that each experience io subtly different from all the others. I said: 'But what is the good of learning something if you forget it the next day?' I cannot quote his reply exactly, but it suqprised me. He said that each thing 'lebrned' is somehow telegraphed to the in- finite - he may have said to God - so that nothing is ever lost. It is theref,ore not the business of human beings to store and cottelate all their expedence; their business is only to seek new cxperience, ffid what they leatn from it is preserved in some cteraal filiog system.\" It can be seen that \"M\" differs from the usual Don Juan type in one importarLt respect: that he feels a certain aeed fot logical consistency. This is a point worth noting. Don Juans ete seldom thinkers; and this holds true generally for all kinds of sexual perverts. Each experience is \"sufficient unto the mornent\". But for men or women with a developed instinct for \"meaning\" in life, too much casual sexual experience can pro- duce a suicidal sense of futility. Tbe Strange Case oJ Artslbashea This is nowhere more obvious than in the literary career of Michael Attsybashev, the Russian writer who died in r 9 27, and, whose novels present a developed philosophy of Don Juanism. Apsybashev achieved inormous fame in 19o6 with the publica- tionof Sanin, whose Ibsen-like hero preaches toal laisseqfaire; he loathes big words and pompous ideals even more than Hemingway's heroes, and also believes in enjoying life without making yourself miserable. His attitude is expressed in the words of the old song: I eat when I'm hungty i I drink when I'm dry :lt , And if whiskY don't get me I'll live till I die. , U\" casually helps himself to the virginity of his best friend's i; lady-love; the friend comrnits suicide; when Sanin is asked to ORIGINS OF THE SEXUAL IMPULSE I. \"l r' 1'\\ i:, ,i !l,r It,: l.l tf l I fl !

First of all, casual sex is glorified in an almost mystical vay, as in the passage fiom Blake quoted on page 9o. Then it elowly degenerates into a vicious Don Juanism, which in turn Pssses into suicidal despair and self-destruction. Wlhat is more serious is that Artsybashev's own work steadily degenerated,; Sanin is a good novel; Or tbe Brink is incredibly bad and pointless; its movement resembles the jetking of a dead frog's leg when galvantzed. His death in ry27 - exiled from Russia by the Bolsheviks - geemed a strangely overdue catastrophe. Fcmale Sexuality I have akeadycommented that this book is written from the t'male\" point of view, for the obvious reason that the author is male, and finds it impossible to r,nake the mental ftact of sfmpathy\" that would make the book more comprehensive. It is true that many women writers have produced brilliant and infotmative books on female sexuality - like Simone de Beauvoir's Secord Sex and Sophie Lazarsfeld's lYoruan's Experience oJ the Male. But this present book is not an attempt at an \"encyclopaedia of sex\"; it is an attempt to explore tJrg subject intuitively in the light of existential psychology, and using a phenomenological method. The following chapter will make clear why this confines the author strictly to \"his owfl,\" point of view (i,e. as a male). But although this approach means that it is impossible to treat the central problems of this book from the \"female\" viewpoint, it is nevertheless interesting to consider the ques- tion: how far does woman's attitude to sex in general differ from the man's? Stekel, for example, has declared that maso- chism is usually an important component in female sexualitn and this leads him to conoect masoch-ism and homosexuality. Most men would be inclined to accept this notion, since the male idea of the satisfactory woman is often of a submissive, easily dominated gid. On the other hand, Joyce's portrait of make a speech over the grave he only comments \"one fool less in the world\". There is a strong incest theme, and it is obvious that if the censor had allowed it, Artsybashev wourd have enioyed developing this into aa affak between sanin and his sister. But although sanin has several suicides, it is a cheerful and happy book. In tiis next novel, Tbe Miltionaire, gloomy clouds have descended. There is a scene in it in which the bored millionaire hero casually possesses a gid by offering her avastsum for her services; but the atmosphere of futility is ovelpowering. The millionaire is bored, disappointed, and ends by .om*itting suicide. It reads like Dostoevsky without the religious mysti-- .i:T. The misery and stupidity of human nature are presented with great pov/er, but there is no compensation; and sex, which in sania possessed a lyrical quality, is now sordid and meaningless. Artsybashev's last maior novel was on tbe Brink (transrated ?t ry, Breaking Point), and it now shows the moral collapse in its final stages. The message of the book seems to be ..Every- body \\rants sex; it is the only reality undedying human existence\". The artist-hero of the book is a Don Juan who argues that the delight of sex lies in conquest, and that mar- tiage is usually cowardice; the book is a series of seductions, qr:arrels, duels, picnics; and intellectual arguments about suicide. But again, the whole atmosphere is dull and grey. The artist agrees that it is necessary to be cruel to be , bon Juan, but he shrugs his shoulders and accepts the necessity. There is no sign that the author condemns him. And the engineer Naumov preaches that all life is a confidence trick, and that the only digilfied way out is suicide. sex may be the final rcality, but it is basically as futile as everything else. Artsybashev hammers home his idea that sex is the i'basic rcality\" by showing how two of the characters almost drive one another to suicide in their love hate relationship; but at the end of the book the man flings the woman on thi bed, pos- sesses her, and then discovers that he has now lost all intirest in her. Oa tbe Brinkends with an epidemic of suicides."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"6o ORIGINS OF TI{E SE>(UAL IMPULSE Mrs. Bloom has often been praised Gy vromen as well as men) for its insightinto female psychologyr and Mrs. Bloom aPPears to have not the slightest sign of masochism in her make-up. Her thoughts form an interestiog contrast with those of her husband because they aever become abstract or speculative; they remain \"down to earth\", anti-metaphysical. And this may be the reason that women acclaim Joyce's insight into female psychology. For the poles of the feminioe mentality are more \"personal\" than those of the male. The woman is at once more romantic and more down-to-earth than the man; the male is given to abstraction and also to physical brutality. In Mrs. Bloom's life these poles are rePresented by her husband, always speculative and intellectual, and her lover Boylan, who walks round her bedroom without his trousers and makes love with a lack of finesse that disgusts her. But if woman's attitude to sex is always more \"personal\" than the mafl's, it does not follow that this attitude has a flecessary component of masochism. Consider, for example, the following case, cited by Reik: \"A young gid in a day-dream or fantasy, imagines hetself on a table in a butcher's shop waiting to be butchered. Occasional- ly, as she lies nude . . , afl employee comes by and touches her body. The touch gives her a pleasant sensation. Finally the butcher comes in with his knife, Presses his hands over her nude body before starting to cut her up. Then before applying the knife, he puts a finget into her vagina. At that instant she has an orgasm.\"* But it should be noted that the actual cutting irp formed no part of the fantasy; the climax came with the insertion of the hrg.r. The girl frra 6.\"o indulging in this fantasy since sh[ was small. Her position on the butcher's slab symbolized helplessness, complete submission to the male - possibly because she would have felt guilt at the idea of being in any way a williog partner in the act. The insertion of the finger is close enough to the insertion of the penis to make this a more- *Quoted in Jcx Pcncrsions and Scx Crimu by J. M' Reinhatdt, p, r4r. PROMISCTIITY Al{D THE CASANOVA IMPT'LSE 6r or-less normal fantasy of a sexually frustrated girl who day- dreams of an all-conquering male. When the case is examined closely, the d'perverse\" element disaPPears, and the masochism is seen to be amagrufication of the naturally passive rdle of the woman by frustration. If a \"pewersion\" develops from hebitual indulgence ih this kind of fantasy, thea it is a tesult of condltioning by frusuation. It is importLnt not to allow such cases as this to lead us to ttre conclusion that the woman's teceptivity is actually an embryonic masochismg there is no more reason for this con- clusion than for assuming that the active r61e of the male is a form of sadism. In neither case is pait necessarily involved. What does seem likely is that the male attitude to sex leads to t'perversion\" more easily than the female attitude, since it is leis personal. Again, Joyce has caught this diffeterrce with ' extraordinary dramatic force in the \"Nausicaa\" chapter of lllwsu. This is the chapter written in the language of romantic novelettes, since it is seen through the eyes of Gertie Mac- dowell. She sees Bloom watching her on the beach, md imagines that he is a \"dark tomantic stranger\"; her thoughts ' then run on fomance and marriage. Once, she recalls the physical asPect of sex when she remembers a lodger who used io masturbate in the bed, but her mind hastily thrusts this into the background. She then allows Bloom to see up her dress by leaning backwards - but still thinking of him in romantic terms. Joyce's viewpoint then switches to Bloom, who is cautiously masturbating, and whose thoughts are completely devoid of romanticism. The contrast is abrupt and brutal, and it makes clear a certain basic diffetence between the male and female attitudes to sex in a way that could hardly be achieved by rrhole volumes of discussion. For Bloom, sex is physjcaf and cerebral; for Gettie, it is largely emotional. The final chapter of the book - Mrs. Bloom's monologue - on{ &ives home this difference between male and female. Mrs. Bloom is , tv/enty years older than Gertie Macdowell, and has none of her romantic delusions (although she shares her taste for romantic"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"6z ORIGINS OF TI{E SEKUAL ITTPULSE Iiterature). But although she treats qex as a physical pleasure and even imagines giving herself to anonymous sailors oo the docks, she can still indulge in romantic day-dreams about Stephen Dedalus, and criticizes her lover because \"he doesn't know poetry from a cabbage\". The oame of Lord Byron occurs sevetal times in her meditations; in a sense, he obviously stands for her ideal of a lover. All her thoughts are saturated with tle romantic and pcrsonal attitude to sex. Conclssian It might be argued that Don Juanism is too easily under- standable to be regarded as \"abnotnal\", even in the least peiorative sense; that it is a mere ovcrflowing of the \"notmal\" sexual impulse, an exuberance. This question can only be answered by a \"phenomenological\" analysis of the sexual impulse, which I shall undertake in the next chapter. In the meantirne thc conclusions of this chapter can be briefly summarized: Don Juanism - or the urge to promiscuity for its own sake - seems usually to be connected with some mild fotm of in- security neurosis. I say \"mild form\" because while a person is desirable enough to attract latge numbers of the opposite sex, the likelihood of more serious penrersions developing is not great. The Don Jrro of Mozart and Da Ponte is the kind of person who could not exist; at least, Da Ponte was flot enough of a psychologist to reveal the neurotic compulsion that would drive aman who could seduce a thousand and thtee women in Spain alone. Shaw's Don Juan is more credible, for Shaw had the insight to realize thata man whose vitality and intelligence render him irresistible to women would inevitably come to rcgard seduction as a tiresome frivolity. The study of Don Juanism makes one thing clear: the sexral impulse carlrlot be understood within its own terms. The im- pulse to ptomiscuity is not explained by saying that a man's sexual desires are stroflger than normd, or even by explaining that some inferiority feeling drives him to \"over-compensate\". This only leads to the further questions: !7hat should be the PROMISCUITY AND TIIE CASAI{OVA IMPULSE 65 t'notmal\" desire, and how ongbt the inferiority to be compen- rated?

But most interest- ing is the statement that \"it could just as easily have been due to the pressure of her hand, or of my own\". (Mitchell is un- usually frank about his practice of masturbation in his teens;' in this, he follows the example of his favourite writers, James Joyce and Thomas Wolfe.) A hungry man may titillate his appetite in vari,ous v/ays that have more to do with the ima- gination than with the gastric juices, but when it comes to eating, there has to be solid food; no matter how good his imagination, he will not feel satisfied until he has actually eaten. Here, Mitchell makes it plain that the \"teal\" act is less satisfying than the imagined version. The nerves of the stdmactr- signal their satisfaction in tesponse to food; the sexual orgasm is a response to ^n act of will and imagination rathet than to a physical reality. Perception This brings uP an impottant general question: that of the mechanism of perception in the sexual act. Certain general principles about perception should be stated at this point, if the discussion is to escape ftom the iargon of the psychiatrist's case book. If you eat a sausage roll you are participating in an act that has both a mental and a physical comPonent - that is to say, a subiective and an obiective comPoneot.If you are hungry, you 65 oN the surface, the sexual impulse is as straightforward T +\"appetite forfood, and can tf,erefore be disfussed in a Iimited physical context. on closer examination, this is seen to be untrue..A man *1y_b: a gourmet who can only enjoy his meals with a white tablecloth, and who likes to stimulatl his appetite with half a botde of claret. But the fact remains that the. whole ?rocess has a centre of gravity - the actual act of eating the food. No matter how many mental 'ofrills,, ate added by the gourmet, they all lead up to the physical act of coh- suming the food, and digesting it, . N:* at first sight the sex act wourd appear to parallel this closely,. the orgasm corresponding to the eating 6r irr. food. But is this true? !v-en the greedi.it goor-andiudsfood; but no man ever died from the stanration of the sexual impulse. The following€xtract from Frank Mitchell,s NoondaL sin: An Atstralian Cbildltood, will make this point clearer: / \"I had read somewhere that first iexual experiences are al- yryr disappointing. . . .

There is a certain physical basis, a kind of \"reality\", to the act of eating it. On the other hand, the ptocess of satisfying your hunger with a sausage roll is not purely mechanical,like putting a coin into a cigarette machine. For although putting the roll into your stomach nal produce the deduceable effect (i.e. satisfaction and the disappearance of hunger), it might equally well make you sick. If you have abad cold, you may not be able to taste it at all; it may be as tasteless as sawdust. (If you hold your breath, it is difficult to tell the difference between an onion and an apple.) And if, while you are eating it, someone in the room is sick, you may also be sick, even though you are not close enough to smell the vomit. It will be convenient to think of eating the sausage roll as the simplest form 5f perception. You not merely see and smell and touch the sausage roll; you absorb it (Whitehead would say you prehend it). In short, you \"know\" it about as thoroughly as a human being can know an external object. Nevertheless, your digestion of the roll does not depend on the roll alone; it also depends on the state of your senses. The problem of the r6le of perception was first investigated by Locke and Berkeley; they posed the question of how far we can know \"reality\" through the senses. They attacked. the commonsense position about perception: that there are objects, and that although your perception of the obiects may vaty slightly (if you are colour blind, ctoss-eyed, etc.), nevertheless, you see things \"as they really are\". Berkeley went so far as to question whether objects exist at all when no one is looking at them. Taken to att absurd extreme, this position is known as \"solipsism\" - the be,lief that no one exists in the wodd except yourself. The next step in the theory of perception was taken by Kant. He also felt that there \"ar.e\" objects out there, of whose existence our senses inform us. However, he tended to agree with Berkeley that the qualities of objects - shape, colour, taste, etc. - are \"added\" by the senses, and that we can never hope to know anything about what objects are \"really\" like. Kant ....u that we ..ff ffi?:;I'; \"se our perceptio:: lmpose a certain order on it. We see the external wodd withio thi artificial categolies of sPace and time; we cannot see it otherwise. These categories are like a pair of blue sPectacles worn on the nose, and they can never be taken off. The theories of perception propounded by Berkeley and Kant ate clumsy in the extreme; in fact, they are flo mote than a rimple recognition of the problem - the problem of how far mental pfocesses entef into eating the sausage roll. Before Locke, perception'vras accePted as a mechanical process, like putting a coin into a slot machine; Berkeley wen! to the oPPo- lite e\"tr\"*e, and suggested that the coin might be imaginaty. Htcwrl and Ge$alt Psltchologt In the twentieth century the theory of perception has at last echieved the rank of a kind of science, and Kant's vague sug- gestion about the categories has been catefully expanded. ther\" are so far two distinct cutrents of this theory, that merge ^ only at certain poirrts. One is the science of phenomenology, founded by Edmund Husserl; the other is the so-called \"Gestalt\" or form-psychology. It is necessary to say a few words about these before passing oo to the problem of the tdle of perception and imagin'ation in sex. Husserl was a mathematician-turned-philosopher, who was dismayed by the chaotic state of Philosophy; he felt that it was too much of a vagae, speculative art, and not enough of a science. He tried to tutn it into a science. Husserl's basic recognitiofl was this: that when we look at the wofld, we see a seriei of shapes and colours that might almost be called \"symbols\" of real obiects. And yet we are not confused by ,this; the mind instantly interprets a cettaifl ^ff.ay of lines and colouts as a book, a radio set' a ttee. When you rcadabook, at least half the work of understanding is done by your own mind; the author would be helpless without this co-operation from the reader. But Hussetl points out that we \"read\" the physical world all the time in exacdy the same way.

He tlen asked: Is it possible to produce a metbod for deciding how far perception is affected by the perceivet? He invented the proCedure of \"bracketing\"., Instead of studying the object, lou study only your perceprton of the object; you \"bracket out\" the object and behave as if it did not exist, concentrating only on the form of the perception.* What is the finalaim of all this \"bracketing\"? Philosophy is the opposite of taking things for granted. In fact, science could be defned as not taking things for granted. The aim o( philosophy is to extend knowledge, to understand the universe. But as soon as the philosopher has stated his purpose, he runs into an immediate difficulty. He is ruthff in the position of the cowboy who shot off his own big toe when he saw it sil- houetted against a window in the dark. He is not sure which is \"himself\" and which is the universel the dividing line is not very clear. Hussed's point is that the philosopher is always accidentally getting himself into the picture. The psychologist Brentano discovered what he called \"intentionality\" - that is to say, the way in which the mind impont shapes on the \"things perceived\". $7e tend to think of outselves as merely \"receiving\" im- *An obvious example of the \"order imposing faculty\" is our relation to othet human beings. rWe can never know another person,fuily in the way we can know an obiect by walking round it. Ve observe as many charactedstics as possible, and then pass a \"judgement\" on the person concerned. These judgements obviously depend on one's own personality and needs. Hence our \"idea\" of another person is a series of observed facets, connected arbitrarily. The equivalent of the phenomenological reduction, on this personal level, would be to attempt to suspend all one's feelings about a person, and to attempt to observe him as detachedly as an entomologist observes the behaviour of a beetle. Corrclating this observation with one's obsetvations made in a \"personal\" ftame of mind would throw light not only on the \"true nature\" of the person observed but upon the biases and feelings that form one's own \"observing mechanism\". I suggest this only as an approximate parallel of Husserl,s method - although, in fact, in the r9ros, Husserl became preoccupied with this type of approach. TI{E METHOD OF ANALYSIS 69 preosions and PercePtions {tom \"out there\"; we think of our- iclves, in a sense, as the \"victims\" of things that happen to us. If a slate falls on yout head, it simply \"happens\" to you, and your mefltal attitude towatds the slate will aot make any dificrence to the pain. So we tend to think of reality as a bully, gonstantly imposing itself on us. But the Hussed-Brentano plcture of the world is the reverse of this; it is our minds that ire the bullies. Impressions and seflsations Pfesent themselves to us timidly; our unconscious minds PromPtly form them lnto raaks, and batter them into some kind of order, so that thcy arc presentable for inspection by the conscious mind. The conscious mind imagines that these sfiIart recruits were always orderly and disciplined; it knows nothing of the \\rork that went on befote its inspection. Hussed wishes to find out exactly what went on before the inspection, to trap the uncon- ecious mind in the very act of \"imposing form\" on the per- 'ccptions. All this may seem irtelevant to the discussion of sex; but it will be seen later that such a discussion would be practically meaningless without a background of this sort. For sex is also largely afl unconscious matter, which the consciousness takes , for granted; the problem is to use Hussed's methods for finding out something about the laws that govern the uncon- ocious in relation to sex. Gestalt psychology shares many of the aims and methods of Hussetl's-transcendental Phenomenology. It is also concerned with the problem of perception, and its basic statemcnt is that we begin by perceiving things as wholes, and only notice later that they are made up of a sum of parts. You see a pah of \"identical twins\", and yet you know instantly which is which, if pressed, you could not say exactly how you know; you could nol reply: her hair is a shade darker than that of her sister, and her nose is an eighth of aa inch longer.

You somehow remembered the phrases as a \"whole\", as a sbape of notes, not as a series of notes - B flat followed by A natural, etc. A simple example might help to explain the approach of Gestalt psychology. The police have developed a method of tracing criminals by means of an \"identity kit\". You have witnessed a crime, and are asked by the police to supply a desctiption of the criminal; but you cannot describe his face in words; it is too much like other faces. But if you are shown a series of photographs and drawings of ditierent men you. might be able to say: \"He looked rather like that one - except that his face was slightly rounder.\" The police artist then makes a sketch of a similar face, slightly rounder; you are now able to say: \"That is more like it, but the eyes are somehow rilrrong.\" And so on. Each new change in the drawing enables you to fill in more relations,until finally you have a drawing that seems to you a fair representation of the criminal. Your memory of the face is not a series of facts - the shape of the nose, the eyes, etc.; it is a whole complex of relations. Another simple analogy might clarify this. Gestalt psycholo- gy is an attempt to discover something about the langaage of the unconscious mind, or rather, its symbolism. In the \\X/est, we have only twenty-six letters in the alphabet, and all our words are built up from different arragements of these letters. Chinese and Japanese have thousands of symbols, each symbol sianding for a different word, so that learning to write Chinese is a great deal more complicated than learning to write English. It is true that the Chinese method is labour-saving, once you have learned all the symbols. Instead of having to place a string of letters end to end,to construct a word, you have one small, compact little symbol. Now Gestalt psychology claims that our subconscious language is more iike Ct ini=re than English. \\Mhen you want to remember a face, you do not \"construct\" it in your mind by adding together a nose, a mouth, a chin, etc. You sort quickly through a huge box of photos until you find oae that more-or- less corresponds to the one you want, and having got the TIIE METHOD OF ANALYSTS 7t gtneral..fomrr, you then make slight corrections fot the nose, Ghin, etc. Gestalt psychology, Iike phenomenology, is an attemPt to 6nd out how the form-imposing faculty works, and why' But mostrimPortant is the problem of \"intentionality\".

This is the way in which it approaches all problems. A mathematician may be baffied by a problem, until it strikes him that it is similar to a problem he solved the day before. A detective may find a case incompre- hensible until certain features remind him of a sfmilar case. Now expetiences pour in on us all day long; unless we had some filtering mechanism they would reduce the mind to be- wilderment and exhaustion in a few minutes. Admittedly, habit is our ally; but it is no final defence. A home-loving stock- broker may catch the same train every morning, and use exactly the same words of greeting to his secretary; and yet every day is different. For every single circumstance that is \"the same\" as yesterday, there are another frfty that are different. The weather is different; the people he passes in the street are different; the nev's in his newspaper is different. Everyone is famtliar with the basic mechanism of the \"filter\": that its ruthlessness increases as the mind becomes more tired. You are on your way to work in the morning; you are feeling fresh after a good night's sleep, and the attention is wide awake. In the evening, returning from a hard day's work, you no longer notice anl,thing; you prefer to bury yourself in a newspaper, and exclude as much of the outside world as possible. And the filter in the mind obligingly makes you oblivious to the chatter of the two shopgirls in your carriage and the noise of rain on the window. The tired mind reduces its perceptions to abstractions. In the morning you might have noticed that one of the gids had nice legs and that the other had recendy dyed her hair. Now they are merelv \"two gids\"; the filter cuts out all unnecessary detail. If you ^re very tired, you might not even notice that they are girls; you are merely' awate that there are two other people in the carciage with you. Later, you cannot remember whether they were men or women. The mind has progressed futher in the direction of abstraction. It retains enough sense of time and place to steer you back home, but the \"order\" it imposes on the world is now of the most arbiaary kind, a few bare lines of latitude and longitude. Plainly, since life is appallingly complex, the 6ltel is neces- raty; wiihout it we would all go mad. But it also imposes a ceriain sameness or our days, a sameness that is the opposite of the \"visionary g1eam\". Children canflot understand the baci memories of adults. They say impatiently: \"But don't you remember - it was that day you lost the button off your oYer- coat on the way to the cinema.\" They find it hard to believe that you can dimly remember the visit to the cinema, but have totaliy forgotten iosing the button. For the child, every day i1 thdllingly-unlike the one before; with his enofmous mental .n rgy,-h\" is more interested in the differences between things than-in their similarities. He can remember exactly what you said and did on aday six months before. But the mind,s desire for simplicity and order.can become self-destructive. Nietzsche emphasized that it is more im- portant to ask: 'oFreedom for what?\" than \"Freedom fron ihat?,,; the same is true of order. The child has no particular putposes; he does not vrant to make a fortune or suPPort a irrg\" family; therefore he has no reason to limit his con- sci6rsn.ss.'The adult has reasons for limiting his conscious- ness; he does it to confofm to a scheme of values. But he is Lazy about his values; he seldom examines of revises them. He does not wake up one morning and think: \"I have now made enough money to allow the poet in me a little freedom; I shall ,o* -p.r*it myself to 'stand the stare' and notice the re- flections of clouds in pudd1es.\" He continues, out of force of habit, to limit his awareness of the wofld to a number of abstractions that serye to keep him sane. But even if he has a sudden illness that fotces him to retire, he may continue to live on a kind of psychological bread and water. The values\" 'othat made him choose this diet have disppeared, but he continues out of habit. The result is a gradual dehydration of his springs of enioyment. The \"values\" have long ceased to be an active soufce of pleasure, and he has filtered other soufces of pleasure out of tris Ufe. No one is really surprised when he dies of a cancef five years after retiring; the undernourished conscious- ness finally begins to consume itself. THE METHOD OF ANALYSIS 73"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"74 ORrcrNs oF THE SEXUAL TMPTiLSE The methods of Hussed and Gestalt ^re plainly a more practical -rl.p in the direction of \"vision\" than anything suggested by STordsvrorth or Blake. If you can examine th; mechanisms of the form-imposing faculty, then you can also adiust them to let in \"otherness\", which is by definition merely that which is normally excluded by the filter. In short, phenomenology might provide a method for tempotarily removing the \"blinkers\" we all wear on the con- sciousness. Its fundamental questiofl is: tU7\"hy is human consciousness so peculiady limited? This question strikes all of us at some time or other. The factpry rxrorker on New year,s Eve feels the sense of \"complete confidence\" and happiness described by Proust; alcohol and the \"holiday spirii,t only contribute to it; they do not explain itaway.In such a moment he may wonder vaguely why he cannot feel like this all the time. The answer is that it would not increase his efficiency as an instrument of evolution; a constant sense of euphoria would blanket the \"challenge and response'l mechanism that . keeps the will taut. once all these basic facts about the nature of consciousness and perception have been grasped, the workings of the sexual impulse become immediately more appareflt. These coo- clusions can be summarized briefly: (a) Human beings possess an anconrcionr will that filters and selects their perceptions. (b) Until they understand these \"form-imposing', mechan- isms, they are in no position to pass judgements on questions about the meaning and purpose of life, human riature, etc. Like the cowboy who shot off his big toe in the dark, they may mistake part of themselves for an alien, an intruder. (c) The \"doors of perception\" all have extremely powerful sptings. It is occasionally possible to wedge one of them open for a short period and to let in a little light and air - the \"other- ness\" of the wodd. But they usually slam very quickly,leaving the consciousness imprisoned in its narrow den. This seems to be the method of the \"lifeforce\"forkeepingus fromrelaxingto rHE METHOD OF ANALYSTS 7t inuch, for getting the maximum of work out of each human will. Human kirgr strive all the time to introduce new elements of \"otherness\" into their lives. Each.rrew achievement produces I sense of power, and opens the \"door\" momefltafily. But dthough the achievement may be permanent, the sense of triumph is not. The door closes quickly; man has to be driven on to new efforts of will. Hman beings, then, baae a clnlnofl aim; a broadening o/ con- sciolcness. And the forces of evolution utilze this aim in the Bame way that we utilize the force of gravity when we harness s power station to a waterfall. They operate on a basis that can only be called a sindle: they keep human beings \"poor\" io consciousness just as an employer might keep his workers poot by imposing heavy fines and taxes on them, taking back ninety per cent. of the wage packet. This inevitably gives to human life the flavour of futility observed by so many phil- osophers. The sense of achievemeflt is destroyed almost im- mediately, so that man is forced to repeat the whole process of striving. Recognizing this, philosophers have pointed out thatmanneeds cunning rather than detetmination and strength. They play the r61e of agitators, trying to stir men to tevolt against this exploitation by the biological forces. If the sense of achievement is more important than the achievement, then men had better learn control of their minds and emotions; by doing so, they might be able to hold on to the sense of achieve- rnent longer, or evefl produce it without long and unnecessary striving. Hence Soctates's \"Know yourself\". They raise an ideal of detachment and of refusing to strive, of cultivating mental serenity. The biological forces seem to depend on rathei crude and bullying methods to keep human beings in their r6le of exploited workers. Life is complex and difficult, and merely to keep alive demands most of the available energy and attention.

Once dl this is firmly grasped, the mechanism of the sexual impulses becomes easier to understand. Don Juanism, for example, becomes immediately comprehensible. The easiest means of achieving an immediate broadening of consciousness is the sexual orgasm. It will be pointed out that the easiest way of achieving alr orgasm is in masturbation. There are no statistics to indicate whether the Don Juan types masturbate mote or less than others; but there is certainly no evidence that Don Juanism is inconsistent.with masturbation. The ex- officer \"M\", cited in the last chapter, said that masturbation is in some ways preferable to intercourse; and he conforms in every way to the Don Juan type. Casanova admits to using the hand of Mlle. de la Meure to masturbate himself; it seems unlikely that he masturbated only when he had a compliant sexual partfler. But masturbation cafl rlever be as satisfying to the ego as the conquest of new sexual partners. Each sexual partner is, io herseH, a kind of ultimate, and the actual act of taking her. a moment of self-glorification - perhaps even a mystical sense that '.'everything is fcjr the best\", that life is not fiorlly defeat, but splendid adventure. \\7hat were all the wodd's alarms To mighty Patis when he found Sleep upon a golden bed That firct dawn in Helen's arms?

Trrn foregoing considerations suggest a ne'w avenue of apptoach to the whole question of sexual perversion - I mean the philosophical rather than the \"pathological\" approach. It is easy enough to decide when a machine is functioning nor- mally, and when there is something wrong, for we know about the puqpose of the machine. But human beings, it would seem, are machioes that have been deliberately sabotaged; a certain frustration would seem to have been \"in-built\" into us, so that 'w'e can never work at maximum efficiency. An even more sinister atalogy suggests itself: that human beings are kept in a state of psychological confinement and frustration in the same way that cattle are fattened for the butcher. There is no \"mechanical\" reason why human beings shouldbe suchapoor, degraded, pitiful lot. Degradation and the sense of inferiodty are \"moods\" brought about by a feeling of inadequacy and failure, of defeat by the \"present\". There is no good reason why any human being should feel this failure. We all possess a vast storehouse of memory, enough material for the deep, broad consciousness of a god. \"I knew agun, what in my wretchedness I had'forgotten. . . the kernel of this life of mine was noble\", writes Steppenwolf. Unforrunately, this store- house is inaccessible; vre ourselves might feel that it is a necessity, but the forces of evolution feel that it is a luxury which human beings might well be denied.

In the twentieth century our lives have become so complex itlhat we have less time than ever for relaxing and turning ^way ,from the repetitious necessities of physical existence. Under the circumstances it is not surprising that there is an ever- i lncteasing emphasis on the simple stimulants of consciousfless i1' - alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and sex. ,i' Besides, there is now a difference in the actual quality of our lnterest in sex. This is because sex is becoming incteasingly an obiect of \"contemplation\" instead of a simple physical in- dulgence. In primitive societies sex is simply something that a , tran does to a girl if he is lucky enough to catch her in a dark corner; it is a pleasant physical act, and it is not likely to 1 occupy the mind over-much during the rest of the day. Today, ' the reminders of sex are continuous. Women dresslightlyand elegantly, in a way that is designed to make mefl aware of what 'they have to offer in bed. Hoardings are coveted with ad- , vertisements involving women dressed in their underwear, clthough the product advertised may only have the vaguest connection with women. (I recall, from my own schooldays, a . huge advertisement for a well-known laxative, showing a pretty gid dtessed in her bra and panties, standing on a bathroom scale and smiling; crowds of goggling schoolboys used to Btare at it as they passed it on the bus.) Certain authors and , film ptoducers havd discovered the advantages of making , their products near-obscene, and. the newspaper publicity I ebout such books and films tutns them into best-sellers. All this raises a quite new kind of problem. The Crusader who had spent five years without sleeping with a '!ilroman may have felt intense frustration, but it could be satisfied at the fust \"Christian\" brothel on his way home. But as soon as a uental component eflters into a physical urge, it stretches it beyond its ordinary limits. Boswell records that Dt.

There is no such connection. Sexual desire increases or decreases by no known law; satiety plays its part, but there is also involved a psychophysical'complexity that defies aaalysis. (In the case of the school guard who murdered the three children, for example, t\"he murderer's previous sexual experience had been very wide and somewhat degeaerate. Nevertheless, satiety alone carulot be blamed for the crime, for he told Paul de River that he had never before experienced complete fulfilment of his sexual desitesr and that he afterwards felt \"much easier and sexually satisfied\".) There is no more reasofl why a certain sexual act should produce \"ultimate satisfaction\" than that a certain ppem or piece of music should effect a release of the emotions. Our tendency to associate sexual desire and its means of satisfaction in a rigorously causal process reveals the same kind of loose thinking that causes us to treat our pefceptions as somehow \"given\". It requires only att act of \"phenomeno- logical analysis\" to show the hidden \"intentionality\" that selects its own sexual goal All the same, the idea of \"ultimate sexual satisfaction', leads to an interesting way of restating the question of Chapter I. Instead of asking:-Where is the Eorderline benueen normality and perversion? we can rephrase the question: Y/hat is the petmissible limit for human sexual satisfaction? In this form it is possible to c tty the analysis a great deal further. For the sentence involves a number of ideas that have beea raised in the previous chapter. \"Permissible\" immediately leads to the question: \"Permitted by whom, or according to what standard of values?\" And the idea of a limit tb sexual satisfaction - some ultimately satisfying experience - raises againthe question of the boundaries of human consciousness, and therefore the question of \"vision\". Let us state one point with emphasis, for it is the key to every discussion of sex, and constitutes the essence of the viewpoint of this book: in speaking of the values involved in forms of sexual activity, tbe \" limitation of con.rciorcness\" is tbe aillain of the Piece.If the question were being discussed in the 8r \"strong\" (i.e. slightly rotten) because he had starned so much in his eadier years. Akutagawa, the \"Japanese Maupassaat,r, has a mastedy story called Yan Grsel aboot a harmliss, half- starved little soldier who develops a passion - afl almost insane obsession - about his favourite dish, yam gruel, and spends tris days imagining what it would be like to eat huge quantities of the stuff. (characteristically, he feels sick aid embarrassed when he finally has the opportunity to consume it by the gallon.) To_ say th_at this mental componeflt stretches the physica.l urge beyond its ordinary limits is not to say that it males it somehow abnormal. It may cause it to go beyond its \"natural', !mit; but then, as the last chapter showed, lature keeps us deliberately subnormal in order to keep the will taut, so \"beyond its natural limit\" does not neiessarily imply ab- normality. _ An interesting illustration of this point can be found in Philip de Bruyn's autobiography, A pagan's Hosanna; de Bruyn writes of seeing a pretty gid walk along the beach in her bathing costume, and speaks of the violence of the desire that he feels. But he goes on: \"The trouble was that I knew it was unsatisfiable. I might get to know her and persuade her to sleep with me. But that would not satisfy what I felt now; it wooid only be a carbon copy of this desire to lay her on the warm sand, remove her bathing trunks, and take her with an instantaoeous fusion of bodies.\" This is important. De Bruyn recognizes that this desire for an unknown gid is of a far more intense order than what he might later feel for 4 gid personally known to him and willing to become his mistress. It is disquieting to think that, if dI Bruyn had been a different type of man, and had the beach been empty, the SirJ might have been strangled and raped to aeet a need tbat could not be otberwise sati{ted.

If they are inttoduced into the present discussion in the form of implications (of terms like \"permissible\", \"nature\", \"biological force\", etc.), it should be understood that this is purely for convenience, in the way that mathematicians use imaginary numbets (the square toot of minus quantities). They hide shades and complexities that the discussion has not yet been able to conceptualize. Nevertheless, the central thesis of this book is in no way falsified when exptessed in that form: the limitation of con- sciousness is the villain of the piece. This is not a justification of sexual \"perversion\" or sexual crimel but at least it offers us the means of understanding it. A mother who is .driven to theft to support het children is still guilty of a crime; but there can be no \"justice\" that fails to take her motives into account. Human beings are deprived of a consciousness that is arguably \"theirs by natural right\". Dr. C. D. Broad wrote: \"Each petson is at each moment capable of remembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything that is happening evetywhere in the universe. The function of the brain and newous system is to protect us from beiag over- whelmed and confused by this mass of latgely useless and irrelevant knowledge, by sbtxing uttt most of what we should otherwise perceive. . . .\"* [My italics.] This view was first ex- pressed by Bergson. In the last chapter I spoke loosely of the \"biological forces\" that deliberately blinket the human con- sciousness to raise it to maximum efficiency. But it should be kept in mind that the \"blinketing\" *ry be again sttbcon.rciousll intentional:we may ourselves recognize the necessity of limiting our consciousness (and therefore our \"happiness\") in order to express out fullest vitality. In that case our ideal seH-expression as human beings would involve a cettain balance between this unconscious intentionality and the conscious desires. Bearing all this in mind, we can treat the question of the \"permissible limits\" of hurnan sexual activity as a ptoblem *Quoted by Aldous Huxley tfl Tk Doors of Peraption. TrtE MEANTNG oF .'PERvERSroNt' about the extension of consciousness. Sexual activity is driven by the same aims and motives as reading poetry or listening to music: to escape the limitations imposed by the need for particularity in the consciousness. Ezra Pound wote: ...thatl Am here a Poet that doth drink of life As lesser men ddnk wioe. He has defined the common aim of all humanity: all would like to \"drink of life\" as others drink wine. Pound's belief is typical of a poet. Hemingway once said that \"only a bull- fighter lives his life all the way up\", suggesting that physical daring is a better technique for intensification of consciousness. But there is dso a ioke * of disquieting implications - about a schoolboy who, on being asked what he wanted to bewhen he gre\\ilr up, replied \"a sex maniac\". Nothing is more likely than that many people believe that the \"sex maniac\" is one of the few members of out society who can \"drink of life\" in a way denied to the test of us. To some extent the view is iustified. I have already quoted the remarks of Philip de Bruyn con- cerning the girl walking along the beach, and his feeling that only rape (or at least, instantaneous possession) would be a satisfactory obiective correlative for the desire aroused. Henri Batbusse raises a similar point at the beginning of the novel L'Enfcr; the narrator describes a dinner in a \"respectable\" boatding house, during which someone speaks of a recent sex crime; the narrator notices that everyone is infected with an excitement that they try to cooceal - even the rnothet of a small gid. All feel a certain secret envy of the sexual criminal. I have elsewhere suggested that the study of \"imitative\" sex cdmes reveals the same reptessed urge. The police dislike the newspaper publication of details of a sex crime because so many of them are followed up by imitative crimes, inspired by the account.

The Black Dahlia killer may have been inspired by a murdeter named Otto Steve S7ilson, who had strangled and mutilated two prostitutes on the same day in 1944 in Los Angeles.

Twenty-seven men confessed to the Dahlia kitling; all their confessions proved false. The twentyrighth false confession came nine years after the murder - this time it was a Lesbian. These false confessions might be regarded as a kind of substitute for an imitative crime; they spring from the same envy of the murderer's ex- perience, and a desire to participate in it. Here is a case where one sadistic sex crime triggered off thirty-fout parallel re- actions - six murders and twenty-eight false confessions - in ^rL area about the size of Greatet London. How many other inhabitants of Los Angeles felt the same envy of the mur- deret's experience, but confined theit imitations to the imagination? Even so, most people - luckily - find such crimes too horrible to feel anything but a certain morbid fascination. Dislike of causing paip is fairly deep in most of us. But sex maniacs are not all murderers - or everi mostly murderers. De River agan cites a very typical case of a psychoPathic rapist. The man was of low intelligence and his photograph shows a loose mouth and weak chin.

For the moment, it is enough to point out that one ofits chief causes is the tise in sexual stimula- ton. Tolstoy complained that there was too much sex in the atmosphere in nineteenth-century Russia; it is not dimcult to imagine his reaction to almost any modern capital city, with cinemas showing \"X\" films involving raPe, most advertise- meflts using scantily clad gids, and many bookshops openly selling near-pornograPhy. Thi consCquence is that the feeling expressed by Philip de Bruyn is no,w mote widespread than ever before.'This is partly due to the human tendency to believe that the gtass is always greener in the other fellow's yard - an envy of other rnen's sexual experience. It is undoubtedly encouraged by accounts of sex crimes in newspapers. This eflvy may also be directed at sections of society where sexual morals are suPposed to be unusually free:* the wodd of attists, criminals, Prostitutes, etc. There ate times when this \"sexual fever\" resembles nothing so much as the gold-fevet of the Yukon gold rush,'a kind of indiscriminate anxiety for any kind of sexual gain. It is atguable that Nabokov's Lolita is about this feeling of underprivilege rather than about sexual relations with a nymphet. Humbert's passion for Lolita is only the passion of mbdern man for the forbidden. Humbert seems to contain the seed of most of the sexual perversions, with the excep- tion of sadism. He indulges in masturbation on patk benches, while peering up the skirts of little gids who raise their knees to adiust rollet skates - a fotm of voyeurism - and later uses the pressure of Lolita's legs to induce an orgasm; his original plan with Lolita is not to seduce her, but to drug het with sleeping pills and use her as h passive sexual obiect, without actually violating her; this is certainly a close relation to necrophilia. But whether intentionally or not, Nabokov has certainly *In 196o I.wtote ana*iclefot a Sunday newsPaper descdbing a\"B7t'l community in Chelsea where the women wefe mofe ot less communal.

TT{E MEA}{ING OF ..PERVERSION,' 87 cteated, in Lolita, a powetful symbol of the modern sense of sexualundeqprivilege.I can think of only t'wo possible ways of treating the subiect fictionally: to wtite about a rapist or sexual 'killer - or to write about some other form of sexud indulgence that can be treated as wholly forbidden. In the eighteenth cefltury adultery was ('wicked\" enough to ptoduce an artistic effect of social revolt; by the late nineteenth century adultery had become a cofiunonplace of fiction (par- ticularly in France). The twentieth-century countelPart of Manon l-escafi orTbe Princoss of Chaes vras a novel like Kuprin's Yama (about a brothel) or Barbusse's Hell (about a voyeut). Ptoust's Btcbercbe, Joyce's Ullsses, Radclyffe Hall's Vell of Lowliness, Feulkner's Sanctuary, widened the boundaries to such an extent tlnt a rsader who is famihat with them all should be virrually unshockable. Faulknet's novel started a . spate of books dealing with gangsters, sadism and rape, the best known of which is Hadley Chase's interesting No Ortbids for Miss Blandisb, whose moral position is so extreme that it challenges cornparison with De Sade. Nowadays, a respectable publisher can issue a book that would have brought immediate prosecution thitty years ago; as often as not, reviewers do not evea bother to comment ofi a few raPes or homosexual love scenes.* All this rleans that it is almost impossible to write a novel about sexual underpdvilege in the mid-t'urentieth century, since all the symbols have lost their shock value. Nabokov's choice of Lolita as a symbol was perhaps the only one possible - apatt, thatis, from multiple rape. *These divide into two categories: books in which the \"sex\" is a mepns to an eod - as in Lolita ot the novels of Angus \\Tilson (which deal openly with homosemality), and books of dtogethet less serious intent, like Pefion Place or Tbe Cbapmat Rcport, in which the sex seems to be an end in itself. There ate also some interesting \"in-betweeners\"; Coulter's Danned Sball be Dcsirc is an example; as a fictionalized life of Maupassant' its a'im is basically serious, but certain episodes - rapes, a detailed des- cription of a g1fl stripping, a whip-fight between two women - would undoubtedly have been banned as obacene thitty years ago. Today, no one even pfotests."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"89 88 ORIGINS OF TI{E SEXUAL IMPULSE This brings the discussion back to the question I stated at the beginning of the chapter: What are the permissible limits of human sexual activity? Nabokov's Humbert is plainly arguing that a society that will not allow him to have intercourse with little girls is treating him unjustly. (The solution of a real-life Humbert would be simply to go to India or North Africa, where he could have any numb6r of nymphets without arous- ing comment; this is another reason for regarding Humbert's situation as symbolic.) Radclyffe Hall's heroine, Stephen Gordon, is similady aplea that lesbianism should be treated as permissible. It is interesting to note the explanation Humbert gives for his fixation on twelve-year-olds. He fell in love at twelve, had some rudimentary sexual experience with the girl, and achieved a sense of freedom, of poetic intensity, that he never again ex- perienced. I have already noted the similadty of Humbert's language describing his feelings in contact with Lolita, and the language of Hesse and Proust describing sudden mystical illuminations. Speaking of his first love, Annabelle, he writes: \"But -that mimosa grove - the haze of stars, the tingle, the flame, the honey dew, and the ache remained with me, and that little gid with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted me ever siflce. . . .\" Thete is an obvious difference here between Humbert's self-defence and that of the heroine of The lVell of Lonelinesr. Radclyffe Hall atgues that a gid who has been brought up as a boy can only achieve normal sexual fulfilment if she is allowed to live and behave as a male. Humbet is not arguiog about the kind of sexual fulfilment enjoyed by most people; he argues, in effect, that he is a poet, that he has the poet's ruper- norrual capacitf to \"drink of life as lesset men drink wine\", and that he therefore deserves to be ailowed the means to this super-normal ecstasy. Radclyffe Hall's plea is reasonable and social; Humbert's is already unreasonable and unsocial, since the essence of poetry is non-rational and non-social. This introduces an interesting problem into the discussion of what is \"permissible\". Most of our moral iudgements are TrtE MEANING oF ..PERYERSIoN,, based on the social $atrc quo (inthe question of banningbooks, for example). What happens if the plea for sexual liberalism is based on some other ideal of society? The Oneida Com- munity offers a practical example. Noyes wanted to teach men to enjoy \"more freedom\" than is possible in a competitive capitalist society; his vision of greatir freedom included treat- ing sexual pleasure at rf it aere $ deirabh for nan's spiritual expantion as tlte pleasure of poetry or nuic, or religious exaltation. It is difficult to say what Noyes would have thought about Humbert's plea, but it is possible that he might have treated it as reasonable. In the same way, the eaily communists of Russia preached free love as an important corollary of the new social freedom. It is signifrcant that the modern liaders of Russia have found this impractical. Noyes succeeded in keeping up the moral tone of his small community; but sexual licence and revolu- tionary seriousness make uncomfortable partners, and considerable vigilance is needed to prevent one from totally excluding the other. The Russian leaders have been forced to compromise, and maintain the seriousness by taking up a Victorian attitude ofl sex and the family.* More to our present point are the views on sex held by William Blake. These are in many ways close to those of Noyes; but Blake w'as a religious ririorrrry where Noyes was only a religious reformer. Unlike his contemporaries, Blake felt that sex is innocent, desirable and an important part of a man's aesthetic and spiritual experieoce. Like \\Xrhitman and Lawrence, Blake denied the sharp dichotomy between body and soul (and consequently between sin and virtue). His state- ment that \"energy is eternal delight\" anticipates the method of phenomenology, and the rcaliza:uon that the \"filter\" *I should make it clear that my feelings about this ate far ftom unsym- pathetic.

This frank recognition of masturbation, and ptoclaiming of the delights of free love, would have shocked Blake's con- temporades if any of them had troubled to tead his prophetic books. That he is speaking of ftee love is obvious, for in the same poem (Visions of tbe Daughters of Albion), a few lines earlier, Oothoon reproves her husbaod Theotormon for iealousy, and says: But silken nets and traps of adamant will Oothoon sptead, And catch for thee girls of mild silver, ot of furious gold.

Thete is a story that Blake wanted to bdng this ideal state of society into his own home, and to begin by sleeping with the maid; his wife felt that this was carrying poetic idealism too fat. Blake's work is full of this glodfication of the sexual cnergies: The pride of the peacock is the glory of God. . The lust of the goat is the bounty of God. The wsth of the lion is the wisdom of God. The nakedness of vroman is the work of God. The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom. He who desires but acts not breeds a pestilence. You never know what is enough unless you know what is mote than enough. Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desire. Tn Earope, the preseflt state of society is described as \"a female dream\". (Blake may have had in mind the matriarchal societies from which modern civilization sprang.) All Blake's favourite hatreds are stigmatized as essentially female modes of thought:'the dualiry of \"body and soul\" and the accom- panying idea of sin and virtue, the limitation of the sexual impulse. The female's central impulse is conservation; con- sequently, she thinks in terms of boundaries and limitations; her acting principle is caution.

This is too much; it brings about a kind of last iudge- ment; the male principle revolts, and the revolution begins, and in the last line of the poern the male creative principle (Los) calls all his sons \"to the strife of blood\". Before leaving Blake, it is worth quoting his remarkable anticipation of phenomenology; this occurs at the beginning of Europet Five windows light the caverned Man: thro'one he bteathes the air; Thro' one hears music of the spheres; thto' one the eternal vine Flourishes, that he may receive the grapes; thro'one can look And see small portions of the eternal wodd that ever groweth; Thro' one himself pass out what time he please; but he will not, Fot stolen ioys are svr'eet, and bread eaten in secret pleasant.

But Blake also implies that man can, if he likes, actually see the world at it it, without the arbitrary unconscious intentionality. This is certainly a more optimistic view than that of Berkeley or Kant, who regard the ding an iclt as unknowable. The reason Blake gives fot man not \"passing out what time he please\" is also interest- ing: self-limitation is preferable to absolute freedom. This is certainly close to Bergson's view of the t6le of the nervous system, and to Hussed's later fotmulations of phenomeao. logy.* Blake, then, ansvrers the question: \"\\[hat are the permis- sible limits of human sexualexperience?\" with the statement: Men have a dght, to all women who attract them; this is a necessary part of man's spiritual development. He who desires but acts not breeds a pestilence. *For English teadets who know only Hussetl's l&at, this association with Bergson may sound fanciful. However, Hussetl's most peneuating and sympathetic commentat,f,r, Hetbet Spiegelberg, writing about Hussed's later worh, tefets to Goethe's \"mothefs\" (Faust II), \"keepers of the key of being\",and speaks of \"the unveiling of the hidden achieve- ments of the transcendental ego\".

THE MEANTNG oF \"pERvERsroN\" _ To express this in the language of phenomenology: if man io to broadea the limits of his subconicious intentionality, he must broaden his sexual experience. ffman is not to allow his intentionaliry to impose upon himself and upon the wodd a deadening limitation, then he rnust r\"trin control of his intentionality; this can be done by keeping in touch with the realm of intentionaliry - the subconscious - through aesthetic or sexual experience. We are now discussing - with a new terminology - the question raised in the section on Gurdjie{f in Chapter II: whether there is some \"ultimately satisfying,, sexual exper- ience, some complete expression of the sexual centre. Gurd- jiclf femained silent on this problem. But many other .o*y- gtics\" have dealt with the question, and always aflsw.ered it in personal terms. Blake, like Noyes, believes in free love. Vhitman, another sexual mystic, had definite homosexual tendencies; he therefore implies in his work that homo- sexuality ! \" permissible expression of the sexual energy. (Presumably this is true for women as well as men.) Lawrence seems to regard sodomy as, in some .srays, a more complete sexual experience than normal copulation. The Hindu Karma Sutrl describes a grcat many sexual acts that the !7est regards as abnormal; and yet it could be argued that its doctrinJs are as closely associated with the visionary mysticism of the Bltagauad Gita as Blake's religious views are associated with his sexual theories. It is simply another aspect of the full expres- sion of man's freedom. AII this, plainly, is a restatement of Gide,s contention: that the legal definition of \"perversion\" ir by no means the \"natural\" definition. This is evident enough without bringing Bhke and Lawrence into the discussion. ftost sexologistJarl agreed that certain practices between husband and wifi cannot be regarded as \"perversions\" since they are not a total sub- stitute for the normal act of intercourse. And yet there are states in the United States whete certain acts,between husband and wife are illegal - sodomy and oral stimulation of the genitals - and where, presumably, a husband and wife could 9' i 'fr .{, t tl' :I ,ti ,fr xr lr t, Lrl rl -tl :ff1' Ilr \",fli1 ; {fl {r 'ij *,; ,1Jr ,l' i f,, ') l i.i t ,;, i"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"9t 94 ORIGINS OT THE SEXUAi, IMPULSE be iailed if they were caught indulging in these activities.

Obviously, such a definition is impossible without first answering the question stated at the beginning of this book: what part does ttre sexual impulse play in man's total being? But the foregoing discussion might have made it apparent that the sexual questioa and the t'philoso- phical\" question help to throw light'on one another. Sex canflot be considercd in uacur, or solely within the context of the psychiatrist's consulting-room, without the problem tuming into a mass of self-contradictions. Before proceeding to consider the question of particular perversions more closely, it might be helpful to restate some of the points that have emerged in the discussion of \"vision\". (a) Man's consciousness is blinkered. @) This is desirable from the evolutionary point of view. Man is still too much of a child ro conduct himself according to values and principles. Accordingln the choice must be taken out of his hands. An \"open consciousness\" would only lead to laziness and stasis; he must be'goaded by the incon- veniences attefldant upon a \"closed consciousfless\". (c) But this also has its disadvantages. Man is at his best when ddven by a sense of puqpose, and by a vision of pur- pose. If consciousness limits this vision, then man's efficiency as arl evolutionary agent is also limited. (d) Blake throws,up the interesting remark that man can dispense with the blinkers \"what time he please\". Can he? Can he? For the moment it is enough simply to sate this question. Introverted Sexaalitl De Bruyn's remark about the gitl on the beach contains some interesting implications that we have not so far con- TrrE MEANTNG oF \"PERvERsroN\" sidered. There are, he implies, tv/o tJpes of sexual emotion. The first is the ordinary emotion to be gained by making the girl's acquaintance and seducing her. The second - fat more intense - is the sudden fusion of bodies in the unpremeditated animal act. Dogs might reduce their courting to a minimum before coupling, but fruman society demands a lengthy \"personal\" pteamble. The case of the girl in the cloakroom - cited in Chapter II - is an exception, and would be regarded by most people as \"abnormal\". It might be argued that the two experiences difer only in intensity, not in quality; this is a decision that can be made later. But the point of the dif- fetence can be made mote clear by comparing the following two passages, the first from Eliot's Vaste Land, the second from W. I. Turner's l{t*u to Her Unknounz At the violet hout, the evening hour that strives Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea, The typist home at tel time, clears her breakfast, lights Her stove, and lays out food in tins . . .

Hulme.* Hulme seems to have had views ofl sex and the will to po\\ilrer similar to those of the ex-army officer \"M\" cited in Chapter II. He liked quick and easy conquests, preferably of shopgirls. Jones tells a story of how Hulme was sitting in the Caf6 Royal when he suddenly looked at his watch and declared: \"I've a pressing *Published by Gollancz, 196o, TT{E MEANING OF 3OPBR\\TERSTON'' 97 cngagement in five minutes' time\" aod sftode from the builclrng.

HuLne tumed on him e4plosively: \"Do you realize you are addtessing a mcmber of the English middle classes?\" The policemaa touched his helmet and walked away. Hulme was famous fot his sudden outbursts of physical violence (as when he hung l7yndham I\"ewis by his turn-ups from some spiked railings ia Soho Square), and for his tales of his sexual encounters. But Hulme's healthy animal copulation oa a steel stairway would haye beea equally repelleat to a sexual idealist like Shelley or a (.worshipper of the body\" like Lawrence. It is completely typiol of the extravertcd attitude to sex. It lsithe opposite of Huxley's descdptiori of sex io Aatic Haj or Tln Gcniu and tbe God*x. At the same time it tr1ust be acknowlcdged that \"intro- 'verted sex\" is always closer to the \"abadrmal\".

But the symbolism herc is plain enough. AII the o'natural otifices\" are reiected, and De Sade makes his'own \"entranceE\" into the female body; he then symbolically posscsses hcr by filling them with wax. At the age of twcnty- cight, De Sade was arrested for kidnapping e pastty cook's widow and perfor,ming this curious oPelation on her. (He was forced to pey out a gteet deal of money in bribes and fines.) It may seem to be a long way from Blake's innocent talk of THB !.IEANrNG oF t'ptrR\\rERsroN\" 99 love and copulation to De Sade's need to inflict pain Aad yet , both are the outcome of a serual mysticism that strivcs to transcend the everyday wodd. Simone de Beauvoir said peneuatingly of De Sade's work that \"he is tryiog to com- municate aa e4perience whose distiaguishing characteristic is, acvertheless, its will to remain incommunicable\". De Sade,s perversion may have spmng from dislike of his mothcr or of othcr \\romen, but its basis is a kind of distorted religious cmotion. This point is of great importaace, and should be made vcry clear. Our basic e4perience of consciousness is of passiaitl, which is another flame for boredom.ITc look at the wodd; it is quiet, apparently unchaaging. It has a poker face. It gives the impression it can outstare you aad outlive you. fn com- parison to the wodd, human fesh is coastantly changing and seething, longing to be moving on, like ao impatient dog on a lcad. This is why most peoplc like looking ai fires, at water- , falls and mpids; it is pleasant to see the material wodd being a little less static; it relieves us of our feeling of iofcriodty in the face of the indiffereflce of a tree. Because the fesh moves faster than the oukide wodd it dreads boredom and firusffation. It wants to fccl all the time; it hates nothing so much as afl internd sagnatioa confronting the impas$ivity of aature. It has flo memory; all its feelingi end boredoms seem doomed to last for eternity. Ser, lihe alcohol, has the capaaty to destroy the stagnation; to turn thc consciousness of ourselves ioto a Niagam. Botcdom is a \"state of being\" ftom which one fiads it dilficult to escape into other states, a self-isolating anxietn like a turtle on its back. But luckily, ve have one infallible ladder from one level of being to another. The sexual act is a miniature symbol of conquest. From the mde point of vig1v, a womao looks demure, ali.n, a n'dty\" that cannot bc eotered; half ra hour later she is naked, submissive, she has sureadcred; the first impression is proved wrong. But if a womaa is not un- changeably distaat, uachangeably vitgiaal, then neithcr is thc wodd.

There is an interesting example of it in Sade's rao Dals of Sodon.

The Dukc immediately insists on caffying out thesamc act on o:re of the gids prescnt - who ie teprcsented as weeping with shamc. _ This rtgry is a typical erample of tle infantile sex fantasy. But the full implications of its immaturity can be brought out by comparison-with another frustratioa fanas& Kierkegaard's ?iort of a Seduer. Kierkegaard's seduccr, Joharnes, sees a beautiful but very you{lg girl getting out of a carriage.

Two savages who had knowa one anoth\"r f.om childhood can sti]l 1\"p. pleasure in breaking down the alien-ness of ..the other\" in sexual intercoutse. If the alien-ness is increased by our civilized habit of weadng clothes, of cultivating various inhibitions about sex, perhaps even by the belief tf,at sex is rattrer wiclccd, then the pleasure of breaking down the barriers will be greater still. fteliglon, in its simplest form, is the be[ef that nature is not cold, indifierent, poker-faced, t}at a tree is not a tree but a god in dig-quise. And even in its rnost complex, subiective fori, it is still the belief that there is an \"6theiness;, beyond our present boredom and inadequacy, a hidden meaning lying in *\"lt: U\\. l -ng\"r behind a bush. And when a myitii ni', \" sudden insight into this meaning (or thinks he has), he is also performing aa ect of breakdown of ariea-ness, .r\"itly like the, sexual breakdown. De sade and Baudelaire have ia common the need to believe that sex is evil. Then there are more barriers to break through in the sexual act, and the sense of falling from one level of being to another is more exciting, more fositive. our biological tendency to r\"Ir..\"te the alien-ness of ..the other\" immediately after demolishing it - in other words, to repeat the cycle of desire - often means that the emotions associated with sex remain immature. rf a youth is bullied by lis father, a &y will probably come when he will knock his father down; in that moment he will feel a great sense of emancipation - he will have fallen from one leiel of being to another, and will feel exhilarated.

When he saw a ptetty girl in the stteet, and wanted to sleep with her, his fantasy was far more realistic and circumstantial. De Sade invented an absurd situation ia which he could ovetcome the double alien-ness of a young and inexpetienced virgin by force. Kietkegaard, closer to reality, reahzed that the gid would havc to be persuaded to fall in love with him and to 6n lly ofier him complete emotional abandonment.

They ate a long way from de Bruyn's-reafization that iull satisfaction of the desire could only be achieved by fliog- ing the girl down and raping her. The more circuitous route of1 perional relationship would bring the social personality into play. Sooner or latet the \"seducer\" would rcahze that he is paying a disproportionately high price - in will and .n\"rgy - for the mere pleasure of penetrating a virgin. This factor of emotional immaturity, and its cause - the repetition of the emotional cycle - is of considerable import- ance in analysing the problems of sexual abnormality.

But it tequires only a moment's consideratioo to teahze tbat a dog or a cat would be incapable of these extremes of pleasure seeking; the body, unaided by the mind, is quickly satisfied. De Sade might be compared to a heretical sect of the Iate Middle Ages known as the Btethren of the Free Spitit, whose basic doctrine was the idea \"I am God\", who believed in the more or less immediate advent of the Thitd Kingdom, when fesh would finally trhtow offits misery and inadequacy, and who allowed ttreir worhsip to degenetate into senral orgies.

Many of the men who feel this inevitably turn to the scfiPtufes, because at least the scriptures afe concerned with ultimates that can be taken seriously. But whether they accept the scriptural notion of a City of God, or whether they invent their own City of the Sun,likeWilliam Morris and H. G. S7ells (whose visions were not the real \"ultimate\" afiicle), all are possessed by a vision of human perfection, of man lifted somehow above his misery and his weakness. Men very seldom have any deep pleasure that seems to felease all their emotions and reach to the very bottom of the being. No doubt this is the significance of those lines that Goethe gives to Mephistopheles, when he promises Faust \"more pleasure in an hour, than in a yeat's monotony\". Boredom and semi- fuIfilment seems to be our cofirmon lot; Kierkegaard claims that men built the Tower of Babel out of boredom. All this has a deep significance, and must be borne in mind in dlscussing the odgias of the sexual impulse. Most of man's ways of dissipating sulplus energy are - or can be regarded as - as futile as building the Tower of Babel: his seatch after political pourer, aftet wealth or possessions. An intensely introverted or subjective man regards these activities with emazernent, as he might regard a Hindu fakir chewiag glass bottles. But all human beings acknowledge the power of sexual gratrtcation to reach deep into mafl's emotions and give him a momentary sensation of being a completely fulfilled being. Hence there is not one of, us in whom De Sade's quest for total and final fulfilment does not arouse a certain sympathy. To recognize this is to apptoach the problem of sex from the only ultimately fruitful direction. The Freudian talk about man's \"libido\" and his various complexes may help to clear up individual cases, but it takes us no further. Sex caonot be THB MEaNTNG oF tnpERvERsroNt' ro, considered in aaaur. or in relation to a social entity called Man vho probably wanted to kill his fathet and sleep with his goother. To e4press this point in an extreme form: the prob- lcms of sex and the problems of teleology (man's ultimate purpose) are bound up together, and neither can be under- etood in isolation. (In alater chapter I shall discuss briefly the modern school of \"existential psycho-therapy\", developed on this basis by Binswanger, Minkowski, Straus, etc., and making use of concepts borrowed from Heidegger and Husserl) The problem of sex, then, and the problem of \"abnorm- ality\", is bound up with so(ne vague notion of \"fulfi.lment\" and with the limits of \"human rature\". The aotion itself may be vague, as a notion, but it is clear enough when it presents itself in the form of an intuition of some deeper, more \"god- like\" state of satisfaction for the individual. The problem can be expressed most simply ia this form: let us suppose e man of unusual intelligence and vitality, fundamentally \"un-neurotic\", well disposed towards his fellow human beings, and with the power and influence of an Eastern despot. (An anarchist would deny that e despot could be uncorrupt and un-neurotic, but we will by-pass his obiection.) Such a man now asks himself the question: Is it possible for me to progress a little further thaa most human beings in the direction of godhead by making full use of my power? Not only is he able to point at arly gid in the street and say: \"Take her to my bedroom at once\", but he is also intelligent enough to profit by his cxperience - in so far as the experience has any content. If we novr assembled a committee, made up of Blake, Ifhitman, Lawrence, De Sade, Noyes, and Casanova, to discuss the problem of how the despot should best employ his pov/ers, we might gain from them their notior of the Iimits and capacities of man's pos/et and energy. Their opinions would conflict in some curious uays. Blake, for example, would declare that a man cannot hope to move in the diiec- tion of godhead except by developing his \"inner eye-, the \"fourfold vision\", striving to cofltemplate the humao rece as"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"106 oRIGINS oF THB sExUAt IMPT,LSE a unitn tecognizing the imagination as its highest aad most powerful faoilty, developing to the futl the intellect and cmotions, and striving to see n'a wodd in a grain of sand,. But he would undoubtedly go oo to add that the ided coa- ditions for this exercise would be a south sea island, full of healthy men and beautiful, uninhibited girls, who would unashamedly oIler themselves to the visionary at any hour of the day, singly or in latger numbers. Noyes would no doubt basically Lgrer, with this picture - adding that all the inhabit- ants of the island should be moved by moral earnestness, and should gpend a great deal of time in discussing together how best to build the City of God. Whitman would substantially agree with this picture, excq)t that, in his expansive way, he might feel that an island was rather a small place, and that this paradise of healthy men aqd women should extend over the whole wodd. He would probably also add that he reserved his right to sleep with the men as well as ttre women. D. H. Larence would probably reject the whole idea with disgust, asserting his basic principle of the untouchabitity of the great marL ruli me tangere. His owa paradise would include only one womao, boundlessly healthy aad wilful, and their sexual activities would iavolve mutual stimulation of ..the fouat of darkness\" by sodomy and the manual process. Blake and Noyes would undoubtedly find Lawrence'spatadise half- hearted and uasatisfactory particolady as Lawrence would fail to satisfy them on the subiect of an ultimate; Blake would find the idea of etemal warfare with the woman neurotic and rurnecessafy. Casanova would,no doubt reject the idea of an island entirelp His owa idea would be to use the wealth and power to dazzle society, aad to have endless love afairs with dimue young cooveat gids, newly married women, beautiful courte$ans, and intelligent youog bluestockings. He would meanwhile produce a tea-volume work summarizing the history of the human race ia a manaer that would combiae dcvastating cynicism with sparkling wit. Ihis, ia his opinion, TlrE MEANTNG oF \"pERvERSroN,, to1 g'ould be the closest that man can ever come to the o.god-like cxistence\". De Sade alone would horrify everybody by some vision of I monstrous, universal orgy. (All, that is, except Blake, who urould whisper: \"Let him get on with it. He'll get it out of his system by the time he's disembowelled a dozen virgins then you'll see what a nice fellow he'll turn out to b\".\") De Sade vould declare that man can orrly become god-like by dis- missing the idea of God, and (paradoxically) Ioing his best to plumb the depth of evil in himself. He would then explain that he had aheady given his attention to the problem of godhead, and had written a treatise on the subject. The rzo Qolt would then be produced as a textbook on how to plumb the depths of evil - beginning with such harmless activities as Bodomous incest and debauching six-year-old girls and, gding vith orgies of torture, conducted with the help of demons. De Sade would explain that all these efforts w6otd finally. establish man in God's place, and make him all- powerful. And yet De Sade might be powerfolly assailed for confusing the issue with neur<ises and immaturity. One of the eatliest ir pernersions described in rzo Days is the drinking of a child,s l urine; latet, it progresses to the eating of her excrement, and even the eating of menstrual blood and miscarriages.

But it is posited of the Eastetn despot whose problem is the subject of this debate that he should be un-neurotic, well disposed to his fellow men, and able fully to satisfy his appetites long before frustration builds them up to this terrifying extreme. This hypothetical debate makes one thing clear: frustration is the basis of much \"abnormality\", and a satisfactory (and"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"IO8 ORIGINS OT TT{E Sru(UAL IMPT'I.SE rut-self-contfadictofy) notion of some \"ultimate sexual satisfac- tion\" uastbebound up with some latger mystical vision about the puqpose of human cxistence. Lawreocet pur9ly sextral mysticism is a halfiray house, an incomplete vision that exteads only as far as a curious state ofunresolved conflict be- tweeo a man and woman. This notioa of thc r6le played by fnrsuation in sexual pcr- version deserves to be closely examiaed. For it immediately involves a question of the relatioaship bewteen frustration and various stages of fluidity in the developing sexual bias. These relationships in tufil suggest a total pictrrte, a kind of map, of man's psychological being, on which aa atea labelled \"sexuality\" ea.be deatly urarked out.

Forgetfulw.rs is in-bsih in rc. \\Pe are inefficient machines. This inefEciency is to be 'blamed' for ebertantsexuality if there is to be an apportionment of blame. The life force has fitted human consciousness with a powerfuf door-spring that automatically closes the door after a few moments. This doorspring must be kept in mind in consider- ing,the following instances of \"perversiotl\". First of all, let us rnake it clear that we are discussing the sexual impulse, the animal desite, as distinguished from vaiious form.s of emotiond atacbnreot. Many writers on sex confuse the issue by pointing out that a lover may steal his uristress's handlerchief ot alock of her hair, they then use this as the \"missing thH' between \"flomal love\" and aberrated sexuality. Hitschfeld ootes that Goethe, at fifi-four, asked Christine Vulpius fot a pait of her slippers, so that he might \"press them to his heart\", atrd asks if Goethe was perhaps 1 efioe fetichist. The ansvler is obviously no, and only an initial confusion of thought could have led to the questioa being put. On tle other haod, Marghanita Laski mentions that when she becamc a telcvision personality, onc of her many comcs- THB MEANTNc oF ttPERvERSroNt' rog 'pondents asked her to send him a peit of her soiled knickers.* ; This, equally obviously, ir genuine fetichism. Miss Laski was tpparently so shocked by this request that she speaks of Sriting it down \"to exorcise the beastliness\". But the interest 'of the request lies in its being simply a sexual response to the tlrne illusion - springing out of the limitation of conscious- lcos -that led other admiters to write asking for her autograph ot offering her theit lifelong devotion; it is intrinsically neithet lnore nor less shocking than the request for aa autograph. But it is an excellent illustration of the working of the principle of limitation of consciousness. It is important to the \"life force\" that the sex urge re.f<lrms soon aftet it has been oatisfied; it would be most inconvenient for the hurnan race if we learned from the sexual experience as quickly and finally lB we learn from certain other experiences. The craving for yam gruel of Akutagawa's little soldier presumably never l, rcturned after he made himself sick on it. The sexual urge l,done can re-form with undiminished power a few hours nfter it has been satisfied. In the case of Miss Laski, the sexual lnstinct was abetted in its work of illusion by the social in- t. ctinct of admiration-for-the-leader. She was involved in a double-alienation frorn the point of view of het admirer: the eimple alien-ness of the sttange female, and the aten-ness of the leader, the person who has been selected to apPear before the eyes of millions of other people, and who is therefore, by thc strange afithmetic of these illusions, a million times as ' important as each individual watching her. i';, At this point it is iateresting to try to formulate a kind of \"''' tubl\" of aberrations, beginning with the minor deviations frorn ril \"normahty\" i in this way it might be possible to gain some in- ', eight into the mechanism of the deviation. For the moment, I i1' shall speak only of deviations in the male, since the work of Kreft-Ebing, Ellis, and Hirschfeld indicates that men are , . more prone to abenation than women.

Men who lead a streauous phyeical Ltfe - as labouters, soldiers, professional athletes, ctc. - pro- bably have little time for thinking about sex, and the energies erc othervrise occupied. This is Tolstoy's idea of aormatity - thc peasant who makes love to his wife orce a wack, and fathers a baby every yeu. The simplest deviation frorn this \"ideal\" is the maa whose attention strays to other womefl, and who may take any oppor- tunity for infidelity to his wife. This Tolstoy would rcgard as the beginning of perversion- (Herein, of course, he is less extreme than St Paul, who seemed to regard all sex as a move- ment away fronr man's rightful - aad thereforc nofinel - preoccupation with God.) The number of men's rnagazines specializing in sophisti- tcd stories of adultery and in pictures of gfuls in their under- 'w'ear, indicate that most men regard the \"roving eye\" as morc or less normal. All the same, it will be observed that very few men stare at a picture of a half-naked gid if there are othcr people present; the examination will be briefer and more crusory than if the man is alone. This is uodoubtedly due to fear that other people may suspect him of committing mental rape on the gful. A quick, masculine appraisal of a half-naked gful is felt to be natural. A loager cxaminatioa may indicate that the man is thinking of sex in a masochistic way, since he caflnot satisfy his desires on a picture; the shame springs from the admission of being a thinker rather thaa an actor; it r.:rly crreo point to the self-enclosed circuit of masnrrbation What is in questioo now, and in all other deviations, is &e illusioa of aliea-ness. Once a manhas sleptwithhis firstwoman he now has a basic |nowledge of what a \\yoman is like. He is like a traveller who has always longed to see India, and who then goes there. fhe basic, aad grcatest need, is now satisfied.

But Lawrence is remarkable largely because, in this par- ticular way, he was so free of the modern neurosis of seiual underprivilege. He'declared - whether it was wholly true or not - that his maior sexual experience (not his frrst) badtaught him something permanently. This is not true for rnost meo. Shaw remarked in one of the later prefaces that in the twentieth century most men have their first sexual experierrce too latc. In the Elizabethan age many girls were mothers at thirteen; rnaoy boys lost their vitginity at twelve - the age when the hunger for sex begins to lrl trouble men.

Some psychological text-books distinguish between thc voyeur and the Peeping Tom. Most rnen are Peeping Toms, since most meo would tum their heads if a naked gid walked along the street, or rf a gid's dress blew up ir1 the wind. But not many mea will place themselves on the wrong side of the law to gtatr$ the desire to see unclothed women, so for police puiposes the Peeping Tom is the man who makes a auisance of himself by trying to watch rvomefl undressing or couples firakin g love. The voyeut is the man who actudly likes to watch en act of senral intercourss taldng place. (Faulkner,s Popeye, tn Sanrtmrl, is incapable of taking Temple's virginity himself, but lies on the bed - wearing his hat - and watches while she has intercourse with Red.) I shall use tle term 'toyeur\" to cover all men who are sexually stimulated through the sense of sight, whether the excitemeat rcaches orgasm or not. The hero of Barbusse's Hell is a curious case of voyeurism. At the begianing of the book he watches a woman uadressing in the next room (although Barbusse is careful not to mention any sexual excitement), but for the most part, i:he scenes he watches have no senral rnterest; his voyeurism springs f,tom a desire to oveicome the fundamental loneliness of human beings, to penetrate other lives and live theur vicariously. It should be noted that voyeurism cannot be called 1 per- version in the seose that it is a complerc substitute for the ?rrE MEANTNe oF \"PERrrERSroN\" lt, normal sexual act. Many men like to watch a womaa un- ,, dressing before they possess her. Most Peeping Toms would , happily possess the woman they are watching if it could be done without danget, or without causing pain. Chades Floyd, . vho was sentenced to life imprisonment in Texas in rg4g,was r Peeping Tom as well as a rapist. One of his victims was in the habit of uodressing wirhout drawing her curta.ins. After vatching her for several nights, Floyd climbed into the ^pafi- ment one night, bludgeoned her into unconsciousness, and teped het. He actuilly speat the night in bed with the coqpse, leaving after daylight. This indicates &at the long aaticipation , had intensified the appetite so that one act of violatiofl was hsufficient to satisfy it. Over a period of seven years, Floyd cornmitted at least five murders with rape, and several at- tempted rapes; after his arrest he was found to be only partly ; rcsponsible for his actions, and was imprisoned in a mental i'.hstitution. Floyd is a typical example 6f simple frus*ation ' (his photographs show ao unattractive l-ittle man) intensified by the stimutatioa of careless women; his low intelligence combined with these factors to remove the normal restraints.

It is like scratching an itch, only, to have the itch transfer itself to another part of the body. But there is no point in getting angry with the sexqal impulse; consequeotly, some of the resentmerit is irrationally transfcrred to the sexual object, the girl. Again, the annals of sexual murder provide many illuminat- ing examples.

This was cefraioly the case with Heiarich Pommetenke, the twenty-three-year-old German sex mur- derer, who committed ten murders.

This is afl aggtessive attitude towards sex that is curiously typical of the male viewpoint. ( have observed this particularly arnoag working mefl.

(Undoubtedly there are fashions in fetichism, and I doubt whether, for example, corset fetichism is now as widespread as it appears to have been around r9oo.) To a certain extent, underwear fetichism may be regarded as being as \"natufal\", h its simplest forms, as voyeurism. The following passage, from Nelson Algren's novel AValk oa tlte lYild Sidt, illustrates my point. The boy Dove is fascinated by a plump Mexican widow who keeps a general store. \"A scent of the Orient came to him.

Sweating and passionless, guilty and spent, the boy lay a long moment with shuttered eyes. This had never happened to him before while waking.\" The last sentence indicates that Mr. Algren is less of a l6alist than he appears. There are probably very few boys of sixteen who have never experienced a sexual orgasm except through a uret dream. But his descdption of a simple act of fetichism is wholly convincing.

Bloom carries on extra- marital love afhirs, has attempted at least one sexual assault on a housemaid, is an underwear fetichist, writes indecent letters to attractive socialites (if the evidente of the mock trial in the Night Town scene is to be taken literally), and even asks one -of his coriespondents to \"soil the letter in an unspeakable wuy\" (use it as toilet paper). He has not had normal sexual intercourse with his wife for ten years, but likes to lie at the other end of the bed and kiss her buttocks and the \"smello$r yellow furro'w\" between them. (It has also been suggested that he inserts his tongue into her anus in one or tli trnat scenes of the book. Joyce's language is often so obscure that this may be correct, but I have not been able to find the pas- sage in question.) At a very early stage in the book Bloom recrlls prkiog love to his wife in the days before they were married, and how she forced chewed seedcake from her mouth into his. Finally, at one point in the book, Mrs. Bloom mentions that her husband liked to wash and iron her knickers. So Bloom's sexual peculiarities range flom minor deviations to definite abnormalities.f I do not know whether Joyce ever made any suggestions to explain Bloom's sexual orientation; but the portiait has ao intuitive accuracy and \"roundnqss\" that makes it possible to consider Bloom as if he is a case out of stekel, and certain conclusions seem to stand out. Bloom has a strong inferiority complex - this becomes most obvious in the episode that folloys the Night Town scene (Eumaeus), where ihe chapter is related in a flat, clich6-ridden language that is actually the language in which Bloom would *rit it. Bloom suffers fro* - *r Franh Budgan mentiones that Joyce'was a paory fetichist, and that, like Bloom, he carried a pab of \"doll's drawers\" in his pocket. . t\\.fnrygans Vake, Joyce's interest in petversion is further developed (see Clive Hart's Stractare and Motif in Finnegans lyake, pp. zol-g). i{is heto petsuades his wife to excrete in his mouth.

Tlie sense of sexual underprivilege, the frustration, expresses itself in minor perversions, chief among them being his fetichism. what exactly is the significance of fetichir- as an outret for frustration?

An outlet is therefore found in onanistic faatasies, intensified by the possession of a garment that would oormally be accessible only to a lover. This idea of the passivity of the sixual obiect - touched upon in the discussion of \"instantaneous and impersonar\" se-x - is of great importance to the understanding of the nature of sexual abnormality.

This, of course, is the pure sexual impulse attempting to evade the sense of personal contact that dilutes it. The point I wish to make - and it is no doubt the cehtml point of this study - is that all these \"perversioas,, can be tegarded as attempts by indiuifuals to escape tbc repetition necltaaism. Plato has a parable about how humankind came to be divided into male and female. Men were once globular objects, in which male and female was united. But they showed such extraqldinery energy and astuteness that the gods became worried that tLese \"ri\"tor.r would become gods themselves. They therdore divided each human beinglnto two halves, slicing him down the middle, and the two halves became male and ferule. This had the desired e{fea. The self- divided beings speot all their time a'.'d energy trying to unite ^$fu male with female. Th\"y stopped being a challenge to the gods.* Ooly a patable - but in the light of existential psychology, it contains more truth than many \"scientific\" theories. fi is true that the basic sexual stdving is a striving for godhead, fot the \"god-like\" sensation of affirmation in the orgasm, and that this is true of all bunaa efort,from writing symphonies to committing murders. It also seems that the unconscious biological forces that move us have hit on the device of the repetition -mechanism to keep us moving and reproducing. This is tatbff like tying a cartot on a stick attached to a don- lcey's collar in order to keep the donkey moving forward. Or the mechanism might be compared to one of those swing *S.ynp9siun, Adstophanes' speech.

Sex carries us to a desired climax of momeotary godhead, then imrnediately deposits us' back where \\ilre started. I want to emphasize agun that this is not true of all human activity. The life force allows us to learn something frorn most expedences; we grovr and mature to some extent. The intellect learns easily. Even the emotions learn in time, so we can no longer be wrecked by absurdities like jealousy and envy. Even the body leatns a litde. If you eat a certain type of food until you are thoroughly sick, your stornach will shrink from that food o/ its own accord for a long time afterwards. The sexual experience is the only one from which we are permitted to learn aluost notbing. Lcarning means, of course, that some residue of the experience is left in \"the system\" per- manently. Some learning is intellectual; you can actually express the \"lesson of an experience\" in so many words, and mean it when you say \"It taught me a lesson\". Even getting dnrnk, or taking drugs, leaves a cefiairtresidue, although it is a well-knosrn experience that you may seem to \"know\" all kinds of things when drunk that have completely vanished the next day. But no experience is as baffling and frustrating as that of sex. No matter how much it brings visions, unites the \"divided self\" into a momentary sense of what it would meao to .be an efEcient machine, its \"lessons\" are almost totally ungraspable to our present clumsy way of expressing our- selves. The history of human evolution has been the history of an attempt to escape the terrific limitations that \"the gods\" have planted into animals for their self-preservation. Man catches a glimpse of some vision outside in the garden; he rushes out of the room, dowa the stairs, along a corridor; finally, he flings open the doot that leads out to the garden - and finds himself back in the room in which he started.

To say that Voltaire or Shaw or Tolstoy \"had genius\" is only to say that they were less weighed down by the inferiority neurosis than most people. It is a fallacy that neurosis is another form of genius. lt can sometimes be an asset, a negative stimulation of the will when no positive stimulus is available. But in most maior artists who were also neurotics - Dostoevsky, Schiller, Lawrencq-the rreurosis can be seen as the factor that gradually destroys the work. The sexual deviation, then, is man's attempt to outwit his inferiodty neurosis by supplying himself with an intenser quality of experience than would be possible within the \"oormal\" lirnitations. It is his attempt to breathe more deeply, to uncramp himself from his stance of unfulfi.lment. t'I am nothing and I deserve nothing\", sayt the hero of L'Enfer.It is not a woman he wants, but all women; but he knows he does not deserve them.

Back at home he spread these out oa his bed and masturbated. After this, he felt ashamed and frightened, and threw them into an incinerator. At this point the'release of the sexual tension, the symbolic act of copula- tion with the pretty actress, the symbolic overcoming of her \"alien-ness\", might have decided him to take no more risks for such a small result. But a few days later another opportunity presented itself, and he repeated the procedure. Beckhardt writes: \"He approached each theft with trembling, his body bathed in cold sweat. Yet despite his feat .. . he was fascin- ated by the idea of entering bedrooms sureptitiously and received pleasurable sensations which he sras unable to descibe.\" This is again a famihar part of the fetichist panern; the mindless repetition mechanism associates all the feelings in a messy lump. The underwear is associated with the thought of undressing a girl. (There is no question of the underwear itself becoming the focus of the sexual emotion; ao doubt it would be even more satisfying if it could be taken off an unconscious gid.) The entering of her bedroom is associated with the underwear. The idea of theft is associated 'vith entering the bedroom. And all the various emotions of fear and shame, culminating in orgasrn, are a kind of catharsis. Shires made the mistake of choosing all his victims from the iame ageflcy, and often from the same immense apartment building. The police followed him one night and caught him with several undergarments under his jersey. Instead of being treated as a neototic who needed treatm\"ri, h\" was tried in I juvenile court, which agreed riot to send him to prison if he went into the army. A few weeks after entering the army he died in hospital from a sudden illness. The case of Shires.makes certain points cleat.

It is easy enough to understand how the shoi can become a \"sexual object\" if it happefls to get associated with the idea of sex in some casual relation- A case cited by .Hirschfeld provides aa illustration. A fourreen-year-old boy was staying with friends, whose only daughter was afl attrac- ,!ive girl of twenty. He used to enjoy lyiog on the hearthrug in fiont of the fire. One evening the girl wanted to reach roL\"- tling_on the mantelpiece, and jokingly stepped on him, saying that she would show him \"how the hay and straw feels,,.-Shi taised her skirt and held out one foot to the fire. The boy was in a fevedsh state of sexual desire by this time, took hold of her foot, and drew it down to his penis. She stepped on him with her full weight, and he experienced an orgalm. This soon became a regulai \"game\" betvleea them. Thelil would etand on him and move her feet around against hii ribs and , ]pnforynately, no psychologist's report on Manuel has yet been I published, and books like John Gray Iflilson's srudy of the casi confine ttremselves to ptesenting the \"facts\" of the cimes - Manuel committed ten murders - and offer no speculations about his menality. However, hints were dropped at the tdal of a \"peculiat sexual perversion,,, and the cvidence rnakes it fafuly clear that this was panty fetichism. Arthough cight of his victims were women, ttrete was no rape; in the two .ar\".-of gitls who wete murdered out of doors, the panties were missing. t29 used to obtaia afl iotensity of experience that would other- wise not be available; i.e. ia a kind of scientjfic spirit, to obain new data. B}t like drug-taking, it is also calable of getting the upper had of the o.experimenter,, and uader- mining his will-power. ,41 Jungian psychologist once made a jocular suggestion to \"\"ql\"i\" panty fetichism, and its apparert independiace of the 9r{iryry hypnosis mechanisms t}at produce crutch fetichists, hair fetichists, etc.; he suggested that it might be some deep tacial memory, from the days when a woman handed her panties to a man as a syn'rbolic act of surender. The idea was aot offered seriousln of course. (Knickers are a fatay recent tnyeltio-n, dating back less ttran two hundred years; our Elizabethan ancestors wore nothing under their skirts.) rt was probably meant as a parody of the Freudian notion ihat shoe fetichism springs from the feeling of the shoe as a symbolic vagina. And yet it catches something important aborrt-the problem. Certain f,etiches are associated arbitrarill with the sexual act, through some eady hypnosis of the se*od impulse. others have the character o.f ineitabre substitutes for the sexual act, separated from it only by some thin barder of frusttation, in the way thet a sexually excited dog will choose to rub itself against a child's ann or leg. In y1l -flavelock Ellis could write: \"[Sexual anomalies] are especially liable to occur in a civilization like our own, ,*L\"r. the stimulations to sexual activity and the restrictions on that 1!ti\"rty - both external and interaal - arc alike so powerful.,, Since that time, the \"stimulations to sexual acavitj, have in- creased, and sex crime in England has trebled. Even to com- pate the popular \"true crime\" magazines of the ,thirties and the 'sixties is to recognize the same point: the aumber of crimes associated with sex and sexual abnormality has incrcased. rt would be interesting to discover the exact statistics by comparing fifiry issues of the \"True police cases,,, type of magazine of the e ,ly'thirties with fifty issues of the salne magazine today. rn the magazines of the'thirties, wives v/ere buried in back gardens, baby farmers nrurdered their"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"r3o oRrGrNS OF TrrE SEXUAL TMPULSE stomach; he would finally seize her foot and she would step on his penis. The patient never mentioned whether the girl also experienced an orgasm, but he describes her with \"bright eyes, flushed cheeks, and trembling lips\" as the palpitations of his orgasm communicated themselves to her foot. Now to speak of symbolic sadism and masochism here is sutely unnecessary. At foutteen a boy's sexual emotions may be overwhelmingly strong. Eveo if he is in every way normal, he is likely to be excited by the sight of a gful's legs in silk stockings above himo and if she also raises her skirt, the effect will be intensified. At this point, the penis is like a gun with a hair-trigger; at the slightest pressure it will explode. That the two continued to do this until it grew into a habit is no proof of sexual perversion, but only of sexual frustration, an intense pressure of sexual emotion. (Nevertheless, the youth was sufficiently inconvenienced by the habit to later become a patient of Flavelock F,llis.) The point to be observed, though, is that any number of \"deviations\" might have resulted from the continued repeti- tion of this experience. The boy might have associated the pleasure with her shoe, with her silk stqckings, or with her panties (if he could see them) - or he rnight simply have developed a taste for being ttodden on (which, in fact, he did). The sexual energies have all the power of a fast tiver, and they are likely to cut their channel in almost any direction in which they habitually overfow. The \"repetition mechanism\" then magnifies the inclination into a \"perversion\". No special hypotheses about the character of the patient are oecessary; the power of the sexual emotion and the repetition mechanism are capable of causing sexual deviations in anj type of per- sonality... The point that stands out cleady from these considetations is that \"fetichism\" is a definite name for an indefinite state. Once, fetichism meant only the sexual craving for inanimate obiects; 'late4 it had to be extended to include parts of the body - the hait, feet, etc. But is there any logical reason why a sexually normal nran should not be called a \"gpl fetichist\", THE MEANTNG or ttPERvERsroN\" rrl^ ' and a homosexual a \"man feticlrist\"? If, \"s all these analyses indicate, sex is \"rnental\" (i.e. made up of a raw sexual energy - the bullets in the guo - and a mental component that deter- i mines choice of the fiager that pulls the trigger), then even conveaient words like \"fetich\" mrist be misftusted. To mahy readers it may seem a dubious advantage to blur the lines of I ow terminolory, a step in the direction of total muddle- ,, headedness. In fact, this blurring of ttre lines helps to destroy i the \"obiect\" view of sex (i.e. the view that sex is a sttaighi- forward appetite, like hunger, that requires a straightforward satisfactioa - food) and throws the emphasis upoa the element , of mental choice -aponfreedon.The old Freudian analyses of , sex proceeded from a basis of. ntatetialism. The conclusions of existential analysis are in the opposite direction. They can be stated in this way; Treat sex witbout preeonceptiow, and app! to it tbe netltods of pbeaonenological anallsis, and it will be seen tbat tlu , wd1 of the nxual inpdsu leads tlte diyutsion into tbe aroa of ltunan freedou, The study of sex, by pheaomeaological methods, is perhaps the most powerful method yet discovered for pur- . suing the existential problem. Ia discussing the sexual impulse, the word \"selectivity', is in some pases preferable to \"intentionality\". In the case of Ellis's patient, a nurnber of subjective factors \"selected\" their obiect, or rather, the shape of his future sexual e4petience. The case of Rodney Shires shows howthis intentionality of selection may go evea further afield in the process of associa- tion; he admitted that enteriog the wornen's bedrooms also caused him sexual excitement. (Disciples of Freud would explain that a bedroom is a hole, and therefore a fernale sex symbol.) The sexual emotion was also apparently intensified by th\" fear and excitement of risLing capture. It is not a loog step frotn the meaahty of a Rodney Shires to the mentality of the kleptomaniac who is driven by sexual excitement to steal from big stores. The process of associatioa is interestingly exemplified in the case of the Ctricago killsl, \\[illiam Heirens. Heirens, who was"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"I'? ORIGINS OF TIIE SEXUAL IMPULSE eighteen when he was sentenced for three murders, had a record of iuvenile delinquency dating back to the age of thirteen. He had spent t'wo periods in \"correctional institu- uons\" for burglary. But apparently it was not rcalized that Heirens broke in to apartments to steal panties. He began to obtain sexual excitement from.stealing underwear before he was twelve. \\Mhen he was thirteen he began to commit burglaries. Soon, tbe sigbt af an open windoa, woild indatce an erection.It was after he was released from the second reforma- tory that he committed his first attack on a woman, knocking her unconscious with an iron bar and tying her to a chat, (Latet, he claimed that he attacked women only when they interrupted him in process of stealing.) There followed r'xro murders of women. Now a sadistic motive began to assefr itself. The first vroman he stabbed in the throat, and then bound a nightgown round her neck. The second was more badly mutilated. On the wall above her bed'Heirens scrawled in lipstick: \"For God's sake catch me before I kill more. I cannot control myself.\" Finally Heirens murdered and dis- membered a six-year-old gid when she woke up aod spoke to him as he passed through her room. He dropped parts of the body into sewers and manholes. He was caught when the police were alerted about sounds coming from an 'oempty\" apaftment. In the attic of his home the police fopnd moie than thirry pairs of panties. Heirens's testimony to psychiauists reveals the typical pattern of the sexually obsessed criminal. The urge to commit butglaries would overwhelm him. If he resisted it, he would suffer ftoar headaches. While committing the burglaries he was in such a state of,tension that he killed unhesitatingly when inteffupted ot startled. To justify these crimes to himself he invented an \"alte*ego\" called George, and declared that it was George who committed the burglaries and murders.* On one occasion he locked his clothes in the washroom and threw the key inside to prevent himself from going out. Halfway *After his sentence, Heirens admitted that George was purc iovention to help a schizophtenia defence through the night the urge ove{powered him, and he crawled along the house gutter to get his clothes, then went out. Finally, the act of entering the windo\\ilr was able to induce an otgasm. Heirens was found sane and seatenced to life imprison- ment. ii . The intereslngpoint about this case is the way in which sex ,,,, became associated with the idea of cail (or with anti-social , o-+i*i+-\\ At r,-^+ it *^^ :. . ; aalvity). {t first it was unflecessary to commit any crime in I order to obtain satisfaction from his fetichistic urges.

Finally, he I develops : tytica.tlycrirninal atritude to himself and to.oii\"ty. ; The criminal attitude is the cxacr opposite of the attitude of irthe social and religious reformer. The reformer feels that he is ,iright and society_wrong, and that he must use his powers of lrcrsuasion to make society accept his own values.

His wickedness is a burden, so he writes a plea for society to catch him. He also invents a ..Mr. Hydet, called !9orge, so that at ieast he can feel that he is still partly good. (Heirens's Roman catholic upbringing may have increaied this tend,ency to a split in his personaliry; although the practice of confession undoubtedly has a grcat deal to be iaid in its favour, it hardly increases the individual,s tendency to be moraily self-reliant.)

Shaw,s peter Keegan spoke of a man as a \"poor lost soul, cunningly feneed in with invisible bars\". This would be the verdiCt on Heirens by anyone who feels an intelligent interest in education and the problems of our society.

Tbe cau of ,,D,V,,,, Sergeant krtrand, Homosexaalitjt and tbe bomosexrul comuunit1t. Tnr analysis of sexuar abnormarity and sex-crime reveals a difficulty that, as fat asl know, has never been clearly stated. Two distinct elements caa be made out in all ..per- vetsion\", two factors that have usually been treated ,. ir.. rhere is an element of?itality striving io .ot its own channel, and the element of degeneation, of exhaustion making a l^st feeble efiort to achieve \"alien-ness\" through a new sensation. It is impottaflt to make a cleat distinctioriber\\reen these rwo elements. De sade touched on the second when he made Durcet remark that the most extreme perversioos are the outcome of boredom, satiety and worthlessness. HirscMeld cites a case that is almol a symbol for dostructive degenera- tion. This concerned a shepherd whose loneliness.rr.I.d hi- to masfurbate excessively until normal manual stimulation ceased to have much effect. He began to inflict wounds on his pltr: {yidi\"g it. He died in his tLirties after an opetation or his bladder. I The firslthiog that strikes us on considering this case is the cmptineu of the patieat's life, when he could find aothing better to do thaa masturbate fifteen times a day. Either from i'hyrrrss or feelings of guilt, he never had seiual intercourse with a ]roman. (Thir is not as unusual as it might seem; the most \"famous e=nmple of a totally celibate man].whose guilt about masturbation tortured him, is Nicolai Gogol, *h6r. stories rre full of strange images of his guilt.) piesumably he was rrt"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"I'6 ORIGINS OF TI{E SEXUAL IMPULSE unable to read ot w1ite, and probably had little general education. Life would have been a long, dull burden of unwanted cortsciousness without his single pleasure. But the sexual instinct was never intended to bear the whole burden of man's need to discharge his energy. Excessive emphasis on sex leads inevitably to degeneration; the divided penis might be regarded as a symbol of the destruction of the psyche This immediately raises the problem of \"more suitable\" routes for the evolutionary energy, and emphasizes again the distinction between the degenerative and the creative elements in sexual activity. Blake wrote: Vhen thought is closed in caves Then lovc shall show its root in deepest hell. That is to say, the frustrated vital energies will express themselves in destruction. But this should not lead us to lose sight of the nature of these energies. Of all philosophers, Nietzsche understood them most profoundly, and laid full emphasis on their r6le. The whole human organism is obsessed by ^ will to pov/er. Nietzsche regarded this will to power as the highest will of which human beings arc capable. The outward striving for social or political domination is its least important and stupidest manifestation. It is the drive for \"complete con- sciousness\" that was discussed in the last chapter. The man who turns it outward to personal domination is guilty of self- delusion and self-betruyal, since the misdirected energies now enter a circuit of frustration, and the evolutionary drive is completely wasted.,Power is another name for lThitehead's notion of an \"absoluteness of self-enjoymint\". Before Nietzsche's concept of power. cafi be understood, this idea of \"outward power\" - the domination of other people - tDUSt be dismissed. OnIy then can a passage like the following be understood correctly: \"\\7hat is good? Everything that heightens the feeling o power in man, the will to power, power itself. \"Sirhat is bad? Everything that is born of weakness. THE MEANING OF ..PERVERSION,, r17 \"'$7hat is happiness? The feeling that power is growing, that resistance is overcome. \"Not contentedness, but mofe power; not Peace but war; not virtue but fitness. . . .\" (Anticbritr, Section e.) In Gurdjieff's \"well-balanced malt\", the striving fot' sexual porner is only one line of struggle towards \"higher evolu- tiofl\". The despait of philosophers and mystics springs from perception of the Power of the \"repeating mechanism\", which prevents maturity on an intellectual and emotional, as well as on a sexual level. One only has to read the work of H. G. ITells to become ^were of a monstrous aPPetite for ideas, a vital enthusiasm, that is as insatiable as De Sade's sexual enthusiasm. When'this kind of enthusiasm has a strong emotional component it tends towards religion, or a kind of poetic idealism, as in Shelley,'Sfordsworth, Blake. But one only has to read about the lives of these men to rca,hze that their \"idealistic\" experience was as heavily taxed by the life force as De Sade's sexual experience; that is to say, it was as inadequate as sexual expetience to serve as a ladder towards n'godhead\". Its \"widening\" effect on consciousoess is almost as short-lived as that of the sexual otgasm, and the evolu- tionary enthusiasm of Men Like Gods and Prometheas Unbound turns into the gloomy sense of the futility of all human effort. And yet the residue of great intellectual or emotional experi- ence is undoubtedly more considerable than the residue of the sexual orgasm. The battle against the \"repeating mechanism\" is conducted on many levels. The healthy and well-adiusted man (assuming for the moment that he could exist) would conduct his war against the \"partial nature of consciousness\" on many fronts. (It is interesting that both Wells and Shelley believed in a multiplicity of sexual experience, and $7ells at least practised it vigorously.) The Nietzschean \"sTill to Pouzer\", the craving for complete consciousness, exPresses itself on several levels- But it is aJways a striving to overcorne the repeating mechan- ism. Somewhere in the human machine there is hidden a kind of thermostat. Just es an ordinary thermostat tutn$ off a"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Ir8 ORIGINS OF THE SEXUAL IMPULSE heater when a certaia temperature has been reached, so this conscious thermostat tums off the consciousness when a certain level of power and intensity has been reached.

It is like a misedy matron who holds the keys to the pantry, and who will only dole out minute quantities of food, enough to keep us from starving.I[e dteam hungrily of tying her up, steding her keys, and eating as often and as much as we like. Or, to use another metaphor (and the language of images is indispen- sable in a discussion of this kind), we dream about finding the hidden lever that opetates the flood-gates of vitality, so that we can turn the feeble, muddy ddbble into a clear, sttong flow of consciousness. The quality of our everyday consciousness is incredibly poor; we only rer,lize bow poor when some fle$/ stimulation or excitemeflt intensifies it for a moment. (Mr. Huxley claims that mescalin has this effect.) Hrlf our living is a dull titual that oryht to be fascinating. For a child, a trip to the seaside brings floods of \"otherness\" that gives him aa intuition of some magnificent and powerful consciousness when he reaches adulthood. In fact, adult consciousness is all watery soup and half-rotten bread that keeps him psychically thia and \"oppressed\". It is this poor quality food that keeps men un-god1ike. Consciousness is synoflymous with vision, and vision means godhead. Sru,ite man is so heavily blinkered, while consciousness flows in such a thin, reluctant dribble, it is inevitable that man should walk with a stoop, and cringe away from experience in case it snatches a\\ray his miserable crust of subjectivity and 'oself-enjoyment\". Instead of thinking of humankind as divided up into the \"normal\" and \"abnoffial\", the socially well adiusted and the criminals, we should see all men as engaged in more or less the. same kind of frght zgainst this automatic robber of their intensity, this robot-thief planted in the mechanism of the TrrE MEANTNG oF \"PERVERSroN.\" r19 brain. The badly defeated may become neurotics or accuany insane - some defence mechanisrn of illusion pteventing total collapse - or may make some clumsy attempt to redeem the defeat by force, and become criminals. It is significant that most ctiminals have the same misd-irected feeling of hostility. It is \"The wodd owes me a living\" or \"Society has driven me to crime\", etc. The psychologist who points out to them that \"the world\" and \"society\" are absffactions that cannot oure anybody anything or drive him anywhere is throwing out the dirty vater without offering to replace it with clean. The criminal is right in his vague intuition of having an enemy who is treating him unjustly. He will be closer to the truth if he says that \"Luck is against hirn\" or \"Life has a down on him\". He r being robbed and beaten; his mistake lies in supposing that, because other men look happier they must be in league with the oppressor. This is the reason that the socially un6t become so often sexual criminals.'Sfe would find excuses for a starving worker who threw a brick through the window of a big store because its owners 'were charging ptices that condemned him to starvation. But the sexual criminal is frequently a. man in the same position. The repeating mechanisms rob him so that he is induced to attach great importance to sexual conquest, but the price he is asked to pay for these infinitely desirable sexual goods is prohibitively high. It is not suqprising if some of the oppressed minority try to smash the window and take the goods without paying the price in energy and will-power. I should repeat that this image of underprivileged and ex- ploited human creatures is intended to be understood relatively. All \"law\" is simultaneously a safeguard and an oppression. Until human beings have reached a degree of power and self-determination that would make a backward slide down the evolutionary scale impossible, the araficial stimulus of hardship remains necessary.

Many human beings may be as happy as their weakness allows them to be undet the constaflt pressure of unfulfiIment. Others - the more seasitive and intelligent - may eveo be glad of \"body and its stupidity\" (Yeats's phrase) that acts as a bulfer against their weakness. But there ate also men who are born with certain handicaps, and who are doouied to a kind of peqpetual stawation of the vital instinctt - mea who, by the time they have paid the heavy \"tax on consciousness\", are left totally iocapable of any affirmation. Sometimes such men as these revolt and become sexual criminals to obtain a few moments of the Nietzschean sense of power, of mastery of existence. Aa interesting example is ttre sexual murderer DeSTitt Clintoa Cook, who is cited by de River. Cook, who was twenty when he was executed in rg4r, attacked gids with a piece of wood and raped tlem when unconscious. His sexual member was so tiny that he and his wife vrere forced to satisfy one another orally. Cook was a weak-chinned young man with a marked inferiority complex, and de River suspected that the piece of wood with which he stunaed his victims may have been a symbol of the erect male organ. His attacks occurred usually at the time of the full moon, and Cook daimed that the sight of the moon made him unable to resist the urge to rape. He was plaialy a man whose only moments of freJdom from his inferiority neurosis occured io the aa of rape on an uflcoo- scious girl. Evea more to the poiat in this connection is the case of John Reginald Halliday Christie. Christie murdered at least six womeo in the house at ro Rillington Place, Notting Hill Gate - five of them for pulposes of rzlpe. Like Cook, Christie \\ilras a mar who suffered from an inferiority neurosis. He was born in Yorkshire, in a poor, working-class family, son of a father who treated his children with Victorian harshness. He was coddled by his mother and bullied and dominated by his sisters, three of whom were older than he. At school he showed himself to be below average in intelligeace, and was poor at games, Being- hi1 mothet's favoutite, he used his weakness as a means o?gaining sympathy, and was frequendy ill. At the age of fifteen Christie made his first attemPt at sexual intercourse with a girl in Loven' Lane, and failed com- pletely. 'when this story got afound he was oicknamed t'R.ggy No Dick\" and \"Can't-do-it Christie\"' Two years hter-Iio r9r, - Christie was gassed and blown !Pin France.

His wife Beryl was a Pretty eighteen-year-old girl. They had a baby daughter, and when Beryl discovered that she was pregnant again, Evans became worried and coosulted Christie. Christie's mind worked quickly; the sexual hunger revived; he sawan opportunityofaccess to the body of the desirable wife. He talked mysteriously to Bvans about his qualifications as an abortionist. The result was that, one after- noon in Novembet tg4g, Christie urent uP to Beryl's fat to perform an abortion, and ended by strangling and raping her. It is doubtful whether he intended to do this; with her husband still alive, detection would be inevitable. Probably he intended only to satisfy some voyeur's urge, or tender her temporarily unconscious with his gas device and satisfy himself before she wbke up. Ludovic Kennedy suggests that Beryl struggled befote she succumbed to fu grt; Christie was too sexually excited to hold back, and battered her uncQn- scious, then strangled her. What happened next is uncertain. It seems likely that Christie told Evans that his wife had died duting an abortion, and that they would both be tried for murder if they were not careful. He oflered to take the baby to Actoa to he looked after by friends. Two days later the baby was also murdered by strangulation, almost certainly by Christie. (All that is known of Eians's character indicates that he would be incapable of such a crime; although he was an inveterate and imaginative liar, he had a strong trait of family affection and loyalty.) Evans probably befieved that the baby was at Acton. A week latet Evans went to lflales to stay with an aunt, and on Novembe4o gave himself uP to the police at Metthyr Vale, saying that he had murdercd his wife. This part of the case ,.-\"iirt mysterious. Although F'vans at one point accused Christie ofihe murder, he withdrew the accusation when told that his daughter's body had also been found. And he allowed himself to b\" tried and executed, with Chdstie as one of the witnesses against him. Three y.att later, Christie began his 6nal \"murdet tam- page\" that ended in his arrest At the end of r91z he-strangled -hiJwife and hid her under the floorboards - probably to have the house to himself. Then, in the next t'nro months, he killed and raped three mofe uromefl - all gitls in their twenties - probably using the \"inhdant\" device to render them uncofl- *ior,'. i{e hiJ the bodies in a cupboard, which he covered with wallpaper, and then left the house. Four days latet the bodies *ir\" discovered by a Jamaican tenant. The body of Mrs. Chtistie, and the skeletons in the back garden, were quickly uncovered. Christie was afrested, tried, and executed. A great deal has been written on the question of the innocence of-Timothy Evans, and the case undoubtedly contributed to the suspension of the death penalty in England in r957. (Even under ihe ,r\"* Homicide Act, however, Evans would still have been Sentenced to death, since he was accuSed of com- mitting two mutders on \"tvro different occasions'.'.) But for the present Pufpose the interest of the case lies in the murders ihemselves. Christie's tnurder of the baby Geraldine, as well as his past criminal record, reveals that this is not a simple case of \"frustration murder\"; there is Present a strong element of criminal degeneracy. But the ftustration element is very strong indeed, and entitles Christie to be con-"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"r44 ORTGTNS OF TI{E SEXUAL TMPTTLSE sidered as another \"Moosbrugger-type\" killer, breaking the shop window for the food he is too poor to buy. Christie's case represents a struggle between the elements of sickness and health. He was always inclined to hypochondria, and to the inferiority neuroses that accompeny it. His revolt against inferiority \\il/as a healthy respoose of the organism; but like all revolts by the weak, it was too violent. It led to the bullying and officiousness of his period as a policeman. It was un- doubtedly a form of schizophrenia. Rollo May has pointed outx that schizophrenia is a loss of contact with \"the real world\" caused by fear, disinclination to faceithonestly; this is coveted over by a coflstructed personality, by rationalizations, in the way that a dangerous hole might be tempontily covered with a board instead of being determinedly filled in. But the strain is great - Iike maintaining an elaborate swindle - and can lead to breakdown or to various forms of violence. May also points out that cases of schizophrenia are increasing steadily in number. The \"typical\" case for the Freudian analyst of fifty years ago vras \"hysteria\"; today it is schizo- phrenia. Christie was condemned to schizophrenia by his weakness; his response to life had to be either a turning awly ot afl attempt to impose himself by deception. (There are many examples of his attempts to pass himself off as a man of fashion, etc. Duncan !7ebb claimed that he maried Bthel by pretending to be a rich man.) Although his sexual appetite was strong - it had been awakened at the age of ten by his sisters, according to his own account - his fear of women was equally strong. He developed the usual furtive sexuality of the subjective type. He may have been a fetichist; the knickers were missing from all the corpses, and he kept female pubic hairs in a tobacco tin. The ideal sexual object for Chdstie was afl uncoflscious \\ilromafl. In several of the cases he admitted to feeling a strange sense of peace and happiness after he had committed the murdet and rape. He may even have felt proud of himself. With the balance so heavily weighted against him, *Existcnce, edited by Rollo May (Basic Books, New York), p. j6, TIIE MEANING oF ..PERYERSIoN,, r4t doomed by \"life\" to frustration, he had met the challenge; he had shown the enterprise and cunning of a wild animal, and satisfied ^a appatently unsatisfiable appetite. Life had played him an unpleasant trick in making him a mild, defenceless, cringing little man, afuaid to make love to a healthy, demand- ing woman; he had refused to lie down under the burden. Society was opposed to his appetite; he set himself up as iudge, and decided that the appctite would be satisfied in any case. In that moment he may have felt as Steppenwolf describes his alter-ego - like a powerful wild animal. Life had beaten him, victimized him, defeated him; but at least he had won one battle. Man is not a worm after all; with enough fight in him, he could be a god. The sexual fulfi\"lment could re-unite the divided ego for a moment, bring back a sense of contact with reality and pourer. In Christie the two elements of sex crime can be cle4tly seen: the degenerative element, and the urge tovratds health. The sadism (the need to strangle as he had intercourse), the murder of the baby, reveal the man who has stopped willing, who has allowed his instincts to slip towards disease. But the acts of violation were an attempt to right the balance, to supply himself with an experience that he felt to be his by \"right\", to escape a spiritual stagnation. This is not to say, of course, that the sex ctimes were somehow \"right\". It is only to point out that there are two forces at work in opposite directions, one making for increased sickness, the other for health. If human nature was as simple as it seems to be - that is, if nature did not \"tax\" our experience so heavily - a sex crime could be a step in the direction of conquest, of godhead. A neurosis is tempotaily dissipated; life is attacked and defeated. If the criminal could then take a Sartrian attitude towards his cdme - a refusal to disown the act, and a detet- mination to develop beyond it - it might conceivably tesult in \"health\". The Sartrian attitude to crime is perfectly expressed by Thomas Middletoa's De Flores nTbe Changeling, who commits a murder solely in order to blackmail a woman to sleep with him; when he is caught he commeflts:"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"46 oRrcrNS oF TlrE sExuAL rMPrrLsE . . . her honout's prize \\7as my rewatd; I thank life for nothing But that pleasure; it was so sweet to me, That I have drunk up all,left none behind For any man to pledge me. . . . This is the ideal existentialist attitude to all experience; to lose nothing, to,refuse to pay the tax on experience, and con- sequently aot to feel \"cheated\", having obtained a pleasure that once seemed infinitely desirable. But only characters in 'Iiterature evade the tax to that extent. A Christie may feel like De Flores for a momeflt, as he feels' drained of a sexual energy that has become mixed with a poison of frustration; five minutes later his own daring crushes him; he paaics, schemes how to dipose of the body, and again lets in the enemy he has iust eiected so vigorously. If Christie is compared with a sadistic killer lilce Neville Heath, the point of this analysis becomes immediately apparent. Heath is the typical criminal-Casanoya q/pe; weak- willed, good-looking, a born liar ^rld ?lser/r, who found sexual conquest very easy. Like Casanova, he feels himself to be a failure in all things but seduction; consequently he channels all his vital energies into seduction - with the usual result: degeneration. Satiety and worthlessness lead to tire development of perversions. At first the pewersions -. inflicting pain on the sexual partner - ate a kind of cury- powder to flavour the sex; eventually they become the main component. A careful examination of the case of Heath - who murdered and mutilated two gids in 1946 - fails to reveal any of the element of urge towards health. The cdmes were not a despaiting attempt to escape his own sickness, but a deliberate wallowing in it by a man who is too weak to feel any sense of purpose. This distinction between the completely degenerate and the health-motivated crime is becoming widely recognized in a rather vague way. The iudges who refused to condemn l-olita andUlxu s/ere recognizing that, although these books may express aa unpleasant aspect of sexuality, they are at least Tr{E MEANTNG oF'(PERvERsroN\" r47 expressions of a cteative and not a degenetative urge. The attempt to'ocute\" cdminals whose crimes are the expression of an anti-social tage is also a recognition that the vital energy might be turned from its destructive channels. No doubt the widespread agitation about Chessman sPrarlg from the same feeling. This point is no doubt alteady cleat to the reader; yet it is worth enlarging to bring out all its implications. Nowadays, most parents would not beat a small boy who tried to undress his female cousin to examine her; they would feel that it was a natural expression of curiosity that should be satisfied. And what of the sexual experience of the ex-officer \"M\" with the nymphomaniac? Opinions may be divided; but there will ineyitably be a body of opinion that feels that such an experience is, on the whole, healthy. It should be noted that the sense of triumph expressed by \"M\" as he looked over the room of \"prostrate bodies\" is not at all dissimilat to the \"peace and happiness\" of Christie looking at his victims. Both e*press the satisfaction of an urge to self-fulfilment. Again, alihough it is hard to imagine that the works of De Sade could ever be openly published in English-speaking countries - theit effect would undoubtedly be harmful - yet De Sade himself is widely regarded with a kind of sympathetic intefest that shows an awafeness of the stfange mixture of creative and degenerative forces in his work. Again, consider the case of o'Felix and Eddie\", cited by Beckhardt. Both men were in their seventies; they spent a gre t .deal of time playing dtaughts together, and used to sit out in the alleyway in the sunshine and tatrk. Thtee gids made a habit of playin g ner thern, aged tea, eleven and fourteen. The fourteen-year-old was mentally retarded, but sexually awake. It was she who used to beg sweets from the men, and who one day allowed one of them to take her on his knee and fondle her before he gave her sweets. The relationships developed; soortr, all three gids were allowing themselves to be fondled in exchange for candy, and partly undtessed. A neighbour sus- pected what was gdfuIg on; the men srere attested, and both"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"r48 oRrcrNs oF THE sExuAL rMpuLsB sentenced. (For some.feason, one was seatenced to twenty years, the other to three.) And yet, as Beckhatdt says, the seriousness of their cdle-s depends very much on the point of view. Evidence showed that the fourteia-year-old was at least as responsible as the men for the development of the relation. It was she who persuaded the other two to offer themselves. The r6les of the two men courd ,be compar\"d to that of a receiver of stolen propeffy who is osered \"iargain that is too gopd to rniss.

Tolstoy was right to condemn the liitress adurteries of bored atistocrats; boredom and d.g\"r\"rr.y *\" armost synonymous. But the question of degetreratioo ot evolution cannot be considered solely within thle sexual context; it is a tehological question. This means that the whole qoestion of sexual perversion must be considered in a new *ry. qr\"stions that would have been irrelevant to Freud - and that would most.ggrtlinly have been irrelevant to \"atomistic,, psychoro- gists like Mill and Spencer - are now seen to be essentiar to the development of the subject. In short, ,n *\"*irteotial psychology\" is needed - one that is, perhaps, \"o* broader a1{ t'eeger than that of liaswang\"t \"t a his^colleagues. This will be discussed at length in the-final chapter. c'- There is a certain sense in which chdstie can be said to be less \"abnormal\" than the fetichist Rodney shires. Christi. *r, avefse to \"normal\" sexual intercourse, but at least he con- THE MEANTNG oF t'pERvERSroN\" r49 tinued to need the female body.* Rodney Shires gained com- plete satisfaction from the underwear - a stage further away from \"rlormality\". Both perversioos detive from the need to escape the prsonal cofltact with the sexual objeet. Consequently they cannot be regarded merely as results of the weakening of the \"norrnal\" impulse; they are an attempt at a sexual experience that is different in kind,not merelyin degree. This urge reaches a certain natural extreme in necrophiln the preference for sexual intercourse u.ith dead bodies. It has been suspected that Chdstie was a necrophile because he ad- mitted that his morbid interest in death began when, as a child, he saw his grandfather's body laid out for burial. The truth of this is doubtful; but it is not improbable that Christie kept some of the bodies around the-house for some time before concealing them. Again, although necrophily can undoubtedly be called a pruerse act, it need not necessarily spring from a specific necrophiliac impulse. Sexual desire andiexo-al curiositylan be very intense in a young man; given the opportunitn he may accePt sexual intercourse with a co{pse ia rather the spirit that Alfred Packer, Amedca's famous cannibal, ate his com- panions in the wilderness. De River writes: \"The necrophiliac is a psychopath. He is of Cecidedly perverse and abnotmal sensuality.\" Such a iudgement is too detached. Lawfence's poem \"Manifesto\" reveals'o abnormal sensuality\". Joyce and STolfe admit to abnormal sensuality in autobiographical *Dt. Francis Camps, the pathologist on the Christie case, has rnade some intetesting speculations about Christie. He discovered spetm in the seams of Christie's shoes, and guessed that Christie was in the habit of masturbating standing up. (He may have been standing over the corpses.) This led him to suppose that Chtistie had no plan of kifling the women whert he rendered ihem unconscious; he only wanted themlo be unable to resist his advances or to render him impotent by active demands. The murders were then committed out of fear of the consequences when the victirh awoke and accused him of tape. Thete is probably some truth in this theory."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"I'O ORIGINS OF THE SEXUAL IMPULSE oovels. The probability is that almost every healthy young man is abnotmally sensual. The other objection to be'made t6 de River's statement is that a necrophiliac is not necess arily a man who performs a necrophiliac act; he may only be doingso faate de nietx. Nevertheless, a \"perversion\" called '.necrophilia, does exist, and its study helps to cladfy certain points about the flature of the sexual impulse, First of all the distinction between the genuine necrophiliac a1d 1\\e person who happens to have indulged in necrophilia should be cleady made. one of the cases cited by de ilirr.t seems to me to belong to the latter group. The accused was a tventy-one-year-old student, a college graduate who now wotked in a morgue. The youth, whom de River calls D.S7., was shy in the presence of girls, and had a negative ,e*r\"i history before he comrnenced his acts of p\"roerJion. He had been in love with a gid of seventeeo who [ad died of tubercu- losis; he had only one act of sexual intercourse with her. The sight of her body in the co(Hn excited him sexually. He wanted to become a medical student but, because the course was too expensive, was forced to take a course in undertaking and em- balming as the next best thing. Inevitably he drifteJ into acts of nectophily with the corpses. D.S7. was arrested, found guilty and committed to an insane asylum. And yet there is nothing in the evidence to show that \"D.Xtr.\" was either insane or a genuine necrophile. The idea of having sexual relations with a co{pse may ievolt most men; but then most men feel no revulsion about the ..alien-ness,, of a living urornan, while a sensitive child may feel that the whole idea of sexual irrt\"r\"oorre is as nasty \"\"d ..di\".r,, as eating excreta. clearly it is a matter of degree, and of accepting intei- cou$e with alien flesh. Any excitable teeaager would, if givea {e_ gPPortunity, have sexual intercourse with every pretty qirl he qet. (In one case in Chicago a ninete\"rr-y\"rr-old Uon Samuel Hryciuk, committed, nearly seventy rapes before he was ctrught; there are few teenagers who would not feel a cetrain eovy of his experience, eveo if they find it basically Tr{E MEANTNG oF \"ptrntERsroN\" I'I distasteful.) Committing sexual acts upon helpless naked vromen - even if they happen to be dead - may be less a sign of perversion than of overpowering sexual hunger. And this case makes even clearer tlari usual the atbitrary definition of the word \"perversion\". Sexual perversion is taken to mean \"against nature\"l but how can \"D.I7.\" be accused,of be- having against nature? Is the action of a female ape clutching her dead baby \"against nature\"? Obviously not. It is only anti- social because it will sooaer or later inconvenience the neigh- bours. But in that case perversion should be defined in terms of social convenience. Far from being \"against fiat:ote\", most sexual perversions are the fault of nature. Nature should be blamed as a bad engineer who spoils the ship for a ha'porth of tar. If nature were more efHcient, sexuality would not depend upon a single all-purpose instinct that cari easily go wrong: the sexual instincts would be delicate, selective, and precise. And if flature's aim is evolution through civilization, and the historians are right in believing that the decline of ancient civilizations is hastened by sexual perersion, then nature can be accused of a kind of bungling that actually defeats its own pufPose. The intetest of the case of o'D.I7.\" - particulady the assault that led to his arest - has very little to do with its necrophiliac aspect. Plainly he found dead rvomen so satisfactory for the reason mentioned by Philip de Bruyn at the beginning of Chapter IV (p. 8o): The sexual impulse is an instantaneo*r thing; in its most violent form it wants to ovedeap the ob- stacles set up by personality. A poet like Turner may speak idealistically of \"bodies fusing into a flarne\", but such purity of sexual emotion is almost an impossibility for two.human personalities. \"D.I7.\" was able to obtain practically what Turner can only speak of in theory. The episode that led to his arrest undedines this. The desire to drink a girl's urine and to eat her fesh reveals an intensityof sexualemotion, a vanishing of the meum-tuum sense - in short, an absence of \"alien-ness\" - that are very rarely achieved by \"normal\" human lsings ia sexual intercourse. The fact that he then chose to perform an"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"ttz oRIGINS OF THE SEXUAL TMPULSE act of sodomy - rather than normal copulation - makes this even plainer. Lawrence, with histalkof the \"fountof darkness\" would have understood this. \"D.Ntr.\" might argue that, through his \"perversion\", he had come closer to the \"abso- lutely satisfying sexual experience\" than most people in a lifetime. This is a point of very considerable interest in putsuing the problem of the nature of the sexual impulse. It should be cleady understood that these considerations do not prove that such perversions as necrophily and fetichism (to which it is closely related) are somehow \"preferable\" - or even equivalent * to the norrnal act of intercourse (as Gide might argue). They only indicate the truth of the main argument of the preceding chapters: that the act of sexual intercoutse is so involved with the peculiar limitations of humaa consciousness that a paftial or perverted act may achieve an intensity - as an expression of the \"sexual centre\" - that is rarely achieved in the more com- plex wodd of \"normality\". This becomes even more evident in considering the \"clas- sic\" case of necrophilia, that of Sergeant Bertrand, cited by Hitschfeld (who quotes Epaulard). There is, admittedly, an element of sadism in Bertrand that may confuse the issue; nevertheless, the case records give an unusually clear picture of the'perversion. Bertrand is beyond doubt a \"genuine necrophile\", as distinguished from a youth like \"D.!7.\". (The difference between them is as clear as the difference between a genuine fetichist - like Heirens - and the example given in Nelson Algren's lYalk on the lYild Side - p. ro8.) As given by Epaylard, Bertrand's case history is regrettably incomplete; since hi rsras arrested in r B4g -longteforJpsycho- analysis - this is only to be expected. He was born in r8zz, and began to develop an abnormally strong sexuality at the age of eight, when he masturbated while imagining that he was tor- turing and violating naked girls. His sadism may have been tied up with his irritability and explosions of impatience. The usual child's urge to smash things was exaggerated in him; when he grew older he was unable to keep a pipe or a pen- ii THE MEANTNG oF \"PERvERSroN\" lt1 knife for more than a day; the urge to bteak it was too great. , \\Uflhen drunk, he was inclined to smash everything within reach. Nevertheless, he '\\vas a good soldier, obsessed with smartness; he was also a good Catholic, and disliked obscene telk. His attitude towards women vras extremely gallant. He was successful in love, and had many mistresses - village gids - who often wanted to marry him. At the age of twenty-four he began to treat animals in a sadistic manner. Nevertheless, the examples Epaulard cites - killing dogs and tearing out their intestines - do not indicate \" genuine sadism; the fact that he killed them first reveals that the infliction of pain was not the object - only satisfaction of the urge to smash. Betrand descdbed his fi.rst actof necrophilyin aconfession; he was twenty-five at the time: \"At midday I went for a walk with a friend. It so happened tliat we came to the garrison cemetety, and seeing a half-filled grave I made an excuse to my ftiend and left him, to return to the grave later. Undet the stress of a terrific excitement I began to dig up the grave with a spade, forgetting that it was clear daylight and that I might be seen. When the corpse - a : woman's - was_ exposed, I was seized with an insane ftenzy and, in the absence of any other instrument, I began to beat the corpse with the spade. S7hile doing so I made such a noise that a r6rorkman engaged near the cemetery came to the gate. \\ililhen I catrght sight of him I lay down beside the corpse and kept quiet for a while. Then, while the workman was awly in search of the police, I threw some earth on the corpse and left the ''cemetery by climbing ovet the wall. Then, trembling and bathed in cold perspiration and completely dazed,,I sat for hours in a small spinney. SThen f recoveted from this paralysis I felt as though my whole body had been pounded to a pulP, and I felt weak in the head.\" Later he dug up the grave with his hands and tore open the abdomen of the corpse. Bertrand committed a number of acts of this natute while continuing to have affurs with village gids, and to satisfy them"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"rt4 oRrcrNs oF THE SEXTTAL TMPTTLSE cgmpletely. An interesting feature of the case is the power of the urge to make him immune to discomfots and difficrrlties. In one case he was forced to dig up fifteen colpses before he found a suitable female. In aaothir he was shot as he was climbing over a wall; but the elperience did not deter him. He also went out on icy winter nights seeking for pleasure, and eveo swam through a pond and lay motionless for a long time in wet clothes orlieo tie heard voites. Bertrand was fnally caught through a booby-trap; he tripped over a string connected to the trigger of a rifle, and was shot. He was eventually sentenced to a yer in prison, and after his telease apparently \"disappeared\". Plainly Bertrand's case is very different from that of ..D.W.,,, rn a certain sense, Bertrand was flot a true necrophile, since the basic instinct in him was purely destructive. And this raises certain problems. How is this destructive impulse to b6 ex- plained? Many children are destructive - but this is natural, since the child spends a gteat deal of time repressing vadous animal impulses to fit into civilized society. The act of de- struction is symbolic of the release of Dionysian energy. For this reason, children derive more pleasure than mosi adults ftoT watching fires or dvers in food; they enjoy bteaking bottles or windows. The adult, with his great.* knowledge o1 the material world, sees life as the problem of maintai*irg order in spitebf nature's tendency to chaos. The child, ^*^i only of an ordedy world, wants to introduce chaos. But this urge to destroy is usually weakened as the child grows older. Life demands from him an abikty ta organize and create, and so incteases his respect for organization. The destructive or anarchicurge is usually confined to the mentally retarded, or to those who are brought artificially into contact with over- powering authority. Epaulard does not offer enough details to provide a reliable basis for theorizing about Bertrand,s destructiveness. No doubt a Freudian psyclologist could have produced certain \"ttaamartc incidents\" from Bertraadrs child- hood to explain it. Whatevei the reasons, Bertrand never outgreril/ his childish TrrE MEANTNG oF ttPERvERsroN\" destructiveness. But he vras apparently a good-natured man, , who would have been incapable of ctuelty to a conscious ' hunan beiag; his male and female acquaintances were unani- mous on this point. [f Epaulard is ^ccarate in saying that Bertrand began to mastutbate Lt the age of eight (which is at least five years eadier than most male children) then it may be that'his sexual development and the natural destructiveness of e child happened to overlap, so that they eventually became , associated in his mind. As a good-natuted lnan, he would feel frightened and revolted by the idea of murdering and tortur- ', itlg,living women. Therefore, the ideal object for his erotic- ' destructive impulses was a female co{pse. It will be noted that Berrand was unlike \"D.W.\" in that his prime interest was in mutilating and disfiguring,not in satisfyingthe notmal sexual urge. Bertrand's attitude to his \"yictirns\" 'was one of hatred; I 'nD,W'.'s\" was almbst certainly one of love, as his final offence siems to demonstrate. The most interesting par' of Berttand's testimony is his description of his feelings after his first attempt at necrophily, \"trembling, bathed in cold perspitation, and completely dazed\". The reptessions, the discipline of the destructive urge, broke like a dam as the oppottunity of satisfying them offeted itself so suddenly. The repressed urges burst to the surface with a force that shatters him and robs him of all normal caution, so that he beats the qoqpse with a spade, and attracts attention. All the evidence shows that Berttand was astounded by his own impulses, but delighted at the same time to realize that there was a possibility of a deepet Petsonal fulfilment thao he had so far suspected. This again is evidenced in his statemeat: \"All my enjoyment with living vromen i$ as noth- ing compared to it\". The pafiial consciousness is momentarily completed; the divided personality unites. There can be no possible room to doubt that Bertrand was a \"sadist nanque\" - if such a terrn is conceivlble. But also of interest is his claim that the sadistic impulses had begun to disappear after his last orgy of destruction, during which he went futhet in mutilation tlan ever before. This may, of I\""},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"rt6 oRrerNS oF T}IE SEXUAL IMPTLSE course, have been only temporury. On the other hand, it is possible that, since Bertrand lras a strong-minded and religi- ous man, he made an eIfort of will to arrest the degenerative procels, and was only following Blake's formula of exorcizing the \"datk energies\" by allowing them full scope. The revolting nature of these cases make it diIf,cult to dis- cuss them with analytic detachment. \\Mhea Blake writes that it is untrue that \"good is of the soul and evil of the body,,, that \"energy is eternal delight\", and that repression and fruitration are the source of all evil, we can accept the theoretical content of the words without seeing to their practical consequences. But Blake's ideas have a practical applica- tion to the Bertrands and 'oD.'S7'.s\" - even to a Christie. Man canflot evolve while he struggles with a split personality. All evil is the tesult of frustration and of the lop-sided working of the \"centres\". (Blake symbolizes the centre$ in his vari,ous mythological personages - Urizen, Luvah, Tharmas, etc.) If energy is allowed to flow outwards naturally, without re- pression, \"evil\" is an impossibility. Repressions result in psychological \"ulcers\", curious pockets of poison, that must be drained. The first results of the draining may be disgusting and hordfying - like draining a physical ulcer or boil - bui thig 5 necessary. The end will be the health of the organism. All this, of course, is if the man has the \"courage of f,is own sins\", and does not allow the degenerative process to set i, by a rclaxation of the will. It seems likely that Blake was una\\rare of the strength of the \"repeating mechanism,,, and therefore of the likelihood that acting-out repressions would lead to degenetation. - And yet Blake's psychology is in many vrays more penetrat- ing than the psychology we apply to the \"crirrrinall/insane,,. He recognized, for example, that unless a mafl can cure him- self, then he cannot be cured. Psychology can help; but the lery idea of psychology contains a fundamental coniradiction, for there cannot be a science of the living psyche that sets out to treat it as e mechanic repairs radio sets. rn a section of rbus spake zarailtustracalled rhe Pale criminal, Nieasche writes of TrrE MEANTNG oF \"PER\\rERsroN\" rt7 a cdminal who is self-cond.emned by his ovrfl contemPt. \"!7hat is this man?

This is the iudgement that Nietzsche might have passed if he could have seen Christie standing in the dock. But the converse is also true: the criminal who has flot con- demned himself - Chessman is an obvious example - is always \"curable\", for his will is actively working towards self- unification. These considerations lead the argument into cutious com- plexities. The various neurotic t)?es who have been dealt with in this chapter have attempted to act-out theit neuroses, to explode their repressions. These neuroses wete ptoduced by unusual conditions. When Bertrand became a necrophile his resPonse to the pressure of his aeutosis brought him an in- tensity of expedence that sulpassed anything that had hap- pened to him. But we arc again thinking and iudging as if thete was a sexual \"ootrn\". No doubt Bettrand's resPonses were abnotmal, conditioned as they were by some peculiar desiructive neurosis. But is it possible to assert that a cefcain conditioning is \"normal\"? It seems likely that \"D.\\W.'s\" con- ditioning was rrorrnal, and that only the intensity of adolesc€nt sexual desire and a certain breakdown of inhibitions about death (that came from seeing a gid with whom he had been intimate in her coffin) led to the act of nectophily. De Rivet's assumption that \"D.'W.\" rilas, to some extent, insane, and that his insanity was the result of his conditioning to the death of his sweetheart, ignores the possibiliry that \"D.W.\" may have exercised an uflconscious intentionality - but nevertheless an act of choice - at every stage of his \"disease\". In a limited situation, with certain desires, he made arl act of choice. S7e may criticize his interpretation of the possibilities of his situa- tion, which led to the act of choiceS but it is meaningless to criticize the act of choice from the standpoint of some ideal ttnofm\". And yet if the act of choice results in sadistic murder, as in"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"I'8 ORIGINS OF TIIE SEXI'AL IMPULSE the case of Kiirten, there is no alternative to criticizing it from an \"absolute\" standpoitrt. ft is possible to make a simple distiaction here, and say that a f'moral judgement,, becories valid if the sexual act involves afl invasion of the rights of ariother person, as in rape and murder; this would puullel the case of the Englishman who replied to an anarchist who claim- ed the right to punch his nose: o'Your rights end where my nose begins\". But this would be an evasion of the issue; for while our laws may declare that consenting adult homosexuals have a right to sleep together, we cafl hardly declare that necrophily should be legalized because it does harm to no one. In short, we are called upon for a definition of ..[ormahty,, utitbit a iframework of intentionalig. Is it possible to dispense with moral judgements and the talk of social norms, of talk of saaity and insanity, and still to ardve at a sensible and consistent theory of sex that can criticize the intentionality that results in sadism, necrophily, etc.? If it were possible, the new theory of intentionality would bear much the same relation to Freudian psychology that Einstein's relativity bears to New- tonian physics; it is not a denial, but a necessary extension to meet new cases and problems. This possibility will have to be left for discussion in the final chapter; Homosexualitl There is one class of \"aberration\" with which I do not pro- pose to deal at length in this book: homosexuality (under which heading I include also transvestitism, the preference of certain men for dressing up as women). This is because the study of homosexuality can contribute nothing distinctive to the existential theory of perversion that I aniattempting to outline. Of all sexual aberrations, with the exception of Casanovism, it is the easiest to understand. To begin with, the bordeiline between male and female is blurred. The general public has been made more aware of this .in re_cent years by the publicity given to cases of ..change of sex\"; if men and women can change sex, then it is reasonable to expect that there should be a whole class of men who are THE MEANTNG oF \"PERYERSToN\" ltg , partly women, and women who ate pardy men. This is a mattet of glands and hormofles, not of \"petvetsion\". Donald I STebster Cory in his book The Honoscxsal in Anerica (rgl l) l, states that he was unavare of the fact of homosexuality fot at this contact with another being has been established the sexual cycle is temporarily completed. But the sense of achievement fades, and the continued success of the relation depends upon how far the two beings can maintain their sense of mutual ' \"strangeness\". With the Casanova tyPe of man, the sttange- . sess fades inevitabln and can only be renewed with another least two yeafs after his first experiencti of attraction to another man. He speaks of his bewildetment at the feeling, and writes: \"I had never been taught that there are meo who ate attracted to other men. No one had ever attempted to seduce ol tempt [1e\". Hence, fot a person such as Cory, homosexuality is normal, and any other way of life is unthinkable. ^ De River, however, expresses the belief that only a small proportion of homosexuals can be placed in this category - that isr'of men or women whose homosexuality can be ex- plained in terms of endocrine changes. But even agreeing that this may be ttue, it does not follow that all other types of hor,nosexual are in some way wilfully responsible for their tastes. At the bottom of homosexuality, as of all othet perversions, lies the ptoblem of the \"tax on experience\". The efficiency of out \"feeling mechanism\" seems to have been delib'erately im- paired. This is one of the few genetal)zations that one can make about human pature with confidence; there aPpears to be an automatic cut-out, a sort of thetmostat, attached to con- sciousness. So that when the poets complain that man is incapable of gratitude, has an absurdly short memory, is de- voured by ambition, is incapable of \"counting his blessings\" and being hrppy, they are observing only the mechanism that has led to the achievement of civilization. They are also observing the mechanism that leads to all sexual abnormality. The maior component of the sexual urge is the sense of'sin - or, to exptess this more moderately, the sense of invading another's privacy, of escaping one's owfl separateness.

The ..dampef,, mech- anism is to blame.x rhe \"perversion\" is an attempi.to circum- vent the damper.

It can be seen that, under these conditions, inter- course with a you_ng-er boy might duplicate faidy closely the physical and psychological sensationi of intercourse with a gid, with the same elements of dominance, violation, etc., and that, once this has become established, the pattetn might easily persist into later liFe. The pathic might later seek Iut men who would be willing to violate him - and the tendency could easily be exaggentedinto masochism - while the activl partner would predumably continue to be attracted to feminine men. Inevitably the homosexual may drift into other perversions ,.,*Th\" analogy.is borrowed from atomic physics.

The accuracy of De Sade's observa- i.o tion can be recognized here; promiscuity leading to satiety and i boredom, whicf, in &rm daas to more extreme methods of stimulation. To summarize: homosexuality, like all other .,perversions,', is the attempt to compensate for the maddening inefficiency of human consciousness.

Doctor Hooker wdtes: tl \"The promiscuity of the homosexual has been attributed to '$i, his psycho-dynamic stnrcture; among other things to his pri- i; m^ry narcissism which prevents him from foming enduring -!l cmotional relationships\". The homosexuals who \"marry', r{y uzually tend to withdraw from this communal activity, in IF' order to safeguard their relationship. They may live in the dt., \"ho*osexual subgrbia\" - whole streets or blocks that have ffi bcen taken over by hornosexuals (although this may not be ffir known to the neighbours). , .[}, The behaviour of the casual \"g y\" homosexual may be re- H garded as an example of the Casanovism tteated in Chapter II. .'i, But the interesting questioo now arises: How far can this {e behaviour be reg#d.d ,, \"abnormal\"? Doctor Hooker sug- \"1, gests that homosexual relations are more casual than hetero- {' sexual relations because sex means more to a v/omaa than to a I nlan, and because she stands to lose so much more by promis- * , cuity. ft can alsobeargued thatwomen havea strooger instinct ;',\" , for security that is apufiof their child-bearing capacity. But in '11 that case, the male-female relation is not \"notmal\", in that it is i I matter of taboos that may strike the male as arbitrary. The There is one imporant distinction between homosexuality and most of the other \"aberrations,,l it sddom springs from a distortion of the sexual impulse by the ..wili to\"power,,. Sadism, fetichism, necrophily, all spring from a form if ..rrp. complex\"; they are based on the need of the individual io inPme himself on the sex partner (or the substitute). In homo- sex,uality this is, on the whole, untrue (although Lesbiaaism is often accompanied by the dominatioa urge).lt is also untrue of transvestitism - which is the reason that I classify it with homosexuality rather than with fetichism (although it ob- viously contains elements of both). A psychologist who accepted Plato's myth of sexuality as symboticaUy true might say that the transvestite is attempting to unite in himself ihe male and the female elements that have been artificially sun- dered by the purposes of procreation, and that the act is an attempt to unite the \"divided psyche\" and escape the conse- quences of \"original sin\". However, these speculations are unnecessadly remote from the centre of the discussion. (It has frequentiy been remarked that transvestitism is patly a 'isocial disease\", since rffomen are not accuscd of transvestitism if they dress as men.) The Ho mosxual Com mani t1 some interesting light is thrown on a neglected aspect of homosexuality in apa;p$ called Tbe Homosexual Conruiniryby Evelyn Hooket (university of california).* Doctor Hooker ii concerned vdth the \"normal homosexual,,, the homosexual who lives an ordinary social life and regards himself as a mem- ber of the homosexual community. Doctor Hooker,s rc- searches were conducted in Los Angeles, and they may be taken as typical for any large ciry in the world Homosexuals might be divided into three classes. There is the lone-wolf homosexual, who may feel that his deviation is a \"disease\" that must be hept carefully concealed, and who feels himself to be an \"outsider\". But the majority of homosexuals are to be found in the other two classes; the.'maried, class (that *Vol. z, Pcrsonalitlt Ruearch, Munksgaard, tg6z. ,' fcmale imposes these taboos in order to chanael the \"casual\""},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"t64 oRrcrNs oF THB sn>ruAl rMprrLSE sexual instincts of all men into narro.w currents of social acceptability. There are also many arguments to be uged against this point of view. Societies in which the womeo f,ro. d-rifted into the casual attitude to sex are usually decadent. Moreover, casual sex and mental instability often seem to be related. Thi reason for this is plain enough. casual sex leaves nothing be- hind; when it is over there is a sense of being back af the beginning again, The more often it is repe\"tId, th\" more meaningless it becomes. For anyone with any instinct for \"T\".rylg\" in life, too much casual sex would produce a suicidal-de.plir becau-se it always brings a sense of having been srccessfully \"conned\", of having tded hard to grasp some_ ghing that has melted away. This problem has beeritouched on in Chapter II. If homosexuality has so far been given prominence in books dealing with sexual deviations, this is mainly because it has previously been associated with social ostracism, and has consequently been the cause of neuroses. It is difficult for the homosexual of today to realtze the torments of guilt felt by a Tchaikovsky or schubert, and their agonies of-concealment. since 9id., many-well-known writers have openly proclaimed their homosexuality without unpleasant consequences. Al- though it is now generally recognized that certain social evils associated with homosexuality (corruption of minors, etc.) must continue to be legally condemned, sexual inversion is no. longer counted as proof of moral obliquity.

And since sexual pleasure is also a kind of discharge of static electticity it is easy to see how the pain stimulus can become associated with sex. In some cases, of course, the infictor of pain has a sexual motive that is not necessarily sadistic. Hirschfeld mentions a case in which a goveroess caught two boys masturbating, and beat them on the buttocks. \"It burned my behind like 6re, but the same time it prickled so pleasantly, so delightfully. It was the blows that did it; it had never been so nice when we masturbated. ... And later I noticed that the governess's hand.s, during the now regular chastisement, frequently strayed between my legs and stayed there. So we v/ere glad of the blows, and when the happy days were over we longed for them\". All that has happened here is that the governess has found an excuse for participating in the sexual play\"of the boys while providing herselfwith an excuse.* Another case describes how a schoolmistress \"alwlys arrrrnged her clothes in such a manner that when we were being thrashed we could push our hands in and feel her breasts, the heaving of which frequently gave us a pleasaat sensation. Many of the boys eatned a fog- ging merely in oider to experience this sensation\".t k, Crime and the Sexrul Psycbopatb, de River prints a photograph distri- buted by prostitutes for fagellants, showing a schoolmistress chastising a boy; she weats a short skirt, and has one leg on a chair; the photograph is taken in such a'way as to suggest that the boy's genitals are in close contact with those of the school- mistress.f In all these cases it is clear that the \"sadism\" is only the initial excuse for sex-play. Another case cited by Hirsch- feld makes this ev6n clearer.$ A young widow with two daugh- ters, aged t'welve and fourteen, asked a male friend to chastise them for misbehaviour. At 6rst the girls had only to pull down their knickers, but later, were made to strip naked to be *Sexual Anomalies atd Pentersionsrlondoa Encyclopedic press, p. 1jg. tibid., p.167. |Crine and tbe Sexaal Pslcbopatb, Chatles C.

The mother held the child, and the chastisement was carried out in such a manner that the gid lay on her back on the sofa, and her legs were beat back towards her head. The mother frequendy let the bathing shorts slip off so that the chastising man could see the gid's vagina.\" Finalln the mother, aftet having all thtee children chastised together (there was also a boy) asked the \"adviser\" to beat her, which he did. HirscMeld does not add whether the two adults frm)ly threw o{f the pre- tences and became lovers. But agaia, it can be seen thafthe element of sadism may or may not have been present; the beatings rilrere an excuse for esablishing a kind of sexual rela- tion between ttre childrcn and the adults. But it is obvious that the sexual stimulation and the pain could easily become asso- ciated in the mind of the children and the adults, causing the childrcn to develop masochistic, and the adults sadistic, ten- dencies. In all these cases the sadism is a mattet of fafie dc mietx.B:ut it must also be remembered that the sectetive element is imfrorant, and intensifies the pleasure to a point that would be impossible in a more open relationship. The idea of the for- bidden is essential in sex; without the sense of the violation of rn alien being, sexual excitement would be weakened, or per- haps completely dissipated. (Both Maupassant and Stendhal have amusing accounts of \"fiascos\" that occur when the desired object is suddenly made too available.) But the above considetations explain only minor degrees of sadism aod masochism. They do not explain sadistic murder, or the true sadism that has no element of masochism. This is rn altogether more difficult matter. The difficulty here is in understand.ing how the sadist can so completely fail to \"iden- tify\" with his victim. Bertrand, as has already beea noted, was too good-narured to be a sadist, in spite of his cutious craving to break thiogs. He \"identified\" too easily. This identification is a natural outcome of man's place on the evolutionary ladder;"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"168 oRrGrNS or rHE sExuAL rMpuLSE man is the most \"social\" of all animals. we note that the least social animals are the cruellest.

It follows narutally that the dog is aa affectionate animal, with almost no cruelty in his .orrrl position, while the cat is strangely sel6sh, and enjoys torment- ilg iT !\"i\"g prey. Man, as the most social oF rU animals, should therefore be the least cruel. This is what makes trui sadism so difficult to comprehend. But there are many othet factors to take into account. First of all, the least energetic aaimals are the least cruel; we cannot lmagine cows or deer - or evefl crocodiles and hippopotami - being_cruel. They are too lazy. But we can assoliati cruelty with the tiger and the cat (even with the spider, another .'lonl wolf\", noted for his tireless indusffy and patience). cruelty is often the outcome of sulplus eflergy seeking an escape. firre word \"energetic\" occurs frequently in the advertisements of sadists and masochists: \"Energetic lady offers her services to men requiring discipline... .\") $7hen energy is associated with stupidity, the result is frequently sadism, since the stu- pidity finds it hard to devise outlets for the eoergy. . Eluafly important is the element of fear or inferioriry feel- ing. Either of these prevent identification. To say that a man is afuaid of another is almost synonymous with saying that he is capable of cruelty to him. children can be cruelleithan most adults because they feel inferior to adults, and artogethet less sute of themselves in the face of the wodd and other childten. The study of ,statistics of sex cdme reveals that sexual criminals fall into three main groups: (a) idiots and morons, who inevitably feel inferior to the rest of society, and vrhose conditions condemn them, to some extent, to being ..lone urolves\", (b) men with a criminal record for other ofiences, and who thetefore feel a certain guilt and resentment towards society, (c) abnormally sensitive and neurotic men who lack a sense of \"contact\" with society. Typical of the first group is sADrsM At{D TrrE cRTMTNAL MErirrALrry t6g the school guard cited by De R.iver, who murdered the three children; Straffen, the English child murderer, is another gxample; obviously an idiot, he was confined in a mental institution.* The second type of criminal may be extremely intelligent, like Chessman or Kiirten. But eaiy clashes with the law develop a feeling of resentmeflt agairist society, and this becomes an excuse for indulging an over-developed sexual instinct. He may also feel that he has been treated un- iustly by society, and is entitled to get his own back. It is the third type of criminal who gives most cause for alarm, for it is inevitable that the number of such men should increase in a highly mechanized civilization. He feels that he has nothing in common with the people who pass him in the street; they are all strangers, as alien as Martians. Since he is imma;t:ure, emo- tionally undeveloped, he may be as serenely selfish as a child. The Peoria murderer, Gerald Thompson (executed in r93 y) is typical of this type of criminal. Thompson knocked out his female victims, mped them in the back of his car, and took photographs of the girls in the act of violatilg them. He then told the girls that the photogtaphs would be sent to their friends if they laid any complaints. He also wrote about these rapes in detail in a diary - more than fifty of them. His mutder of Mildred Hallmark led to a manhunt and his arrest. Here is the true sadistic attitude - total lack of identification with the victim, who remains an \"object\" even when he is involved in conversation with her. It would be interesting to know details of Thompson's eadier life - whether a lack of a{fection in childhood led to this \"independent\" attitude to other human beings. Although Thompson killed only one of his victims - and this was probably by accident - he is undoubtedly a \"ttve sadist\"; he played with his victims like a cat with a mouse. One girl told how he kept her in his cat for neady two hours before *Ftom which, unfortunately, he succeeded in escaping a few years after his confnement.

Far more typical is the case of Morris Leland, the rapist of Portland, Oregon, who stated, in his confession to the murder of a fifteea-year-old gful: \"She was such a aice, sweet kid,I didn't want to kill her at all. . . . I slugged her over the head. Whea she was out,I didn't mind stabbing her,,. And yet Leland, like Thompson, made, a habit of holding women prisoner and threatening them with a kaife until he [ad com- pleted the assault. (He was executed, four years after the murdet, in rgll.) It might almost be said fhat men like Thompson and Leland are \"outsider\" types; they feel no connection with the rest of society. I have pointed out elsewhere that a society like ours inevitably creates \"outsiders\", mefl who live in society and yet do not feel as if they \"belong\". This is rot to say that the \"outsider\" is the potential sex criminal, for sex crime usually seems to be associated with arrested emotional development, the child's tendency to grab what he wants without thinking of the consequences. But if the increasing impersonality of society causes outsiders to multiply, it is logical that the oum- ber of \"outsider\" sexual criminals should multiply in a certain mathematical proportion. It should be recognized that the tendency to discount other people is not necessadly a sign of social unfitness. In his stories of Mr. Keuuer, Bert Brecht has an anecdote that uader- Iines this point. \"S7hat do you do\", Mr. Keunerwas asked, \"whenyou love a person?\" \"f make a sketch\", said Mt. Keuner, ..and then make sure that I get a good likeness.\" \"To the person?.. ..Nor,' said Mt.

SADTSM AND THE CRTMTNAL MEN'rALrTy t7l object should fit herself to his idea of her. But here the attirude is that of an intolerant man of genius who wants to raise people to the level of his ideals. Brecht, the \"intellectual out- sider\", treats the other person as an object to satisfy an ia- tellectual ideal. The sadist treats the other as an object in order to satisfy a physical appetite. At the same time it cannot be separated from the idea of d.efeat, A sadist is a man who, in some sense, has his back to the wall. Nothing is farther from sadism, for example, than the cheerful, optimistic mentality of a Shaw or !7ells. This sense of defeat requires closer analysis. Itwas Heideg- ger who first introduced into existentialism the concepts of ,:t \"authentic\" and \"inauthentic\" existence. For Heidegger, I authentic existence is existence in the race of death - the sudden ' knowledge of the value of lirfe, the intensity and determina- , tion. I Cleady this \"authentic existence\" of HeideggJr has some- thirg in commonwithGurdjie{f's ideaof a manwith all seven centres working ia harmony. In fact, Gurdjieff makes one of his characters (in All and Eaerytbing) say that what man needi most is an organ whereby he can always perceive the hour of his own death. Our laziness, our lack of sense of urgencyr our botedom, leads us to live in this curiously half-hearted and inefficient way. This \"rlotmal living\" Heidegger calls inauthen- tic existence. Sartre extended Heidegger's psychology by adding another term to it: the idea of \"bad faith\".

Th.r\" is no small internal spark that declares \"r exist',. The intuitions fall into the subconscious as if down a lift-shaft; man is left stranded in his mere reasoo and in feelings that spdng from outside - humiliation, pain - instead of the feelings that come from ioside. Being caught doing something discreditable is an extreme example. (A maa about to be executed would be an eveo more extrerne example; he would feel that whatever \"reality,, he possesses is in the hands of his executioners, and is about to be throva aw,,y as useless.) But almost every moment of the day brings -s9me minor emergency that snatthes away a tiny part of our identiry. Mr.Eliot points out that merely missing a step as_we are walkingdownstairc gives us a serse of being a Te_t\" obi-ect, a victim of fate. (r should point out thar \"existJn- tial psycholog'y\" is by ao means the inventioa of sartre and SADISM AI\\TD THE CRIMINAL.MEIITALITY T7, Heidegger; it pervades modern literature from Dostoevsky onwards.) tMhitehead invented a term that is invaluable for the existen- tial psychologist: the idea of \"prehensiolr\". Prehension is the act of digesting our experience. Sartre once made the dubious ,, assertion that our most fundamental expedence is one of I nausea - that a kind of sickness lies at the bottom of our con- sciousness. Whitehead's prehension is a less extreme version of I this notion. !7hen you feel sick, you frequently make an effort not to be sick; if it is successful, whatever is troubling the stomach is persuaded to allow itself to be digested. But noth- i i\"g is ever digested attonaticalll; all the'worfirrg, of the body spdng from an unconscious act of will. So the conscious efiort not to be sick might be regarded as an extreme form of the effort the stomach makes after every meal. And prehension is also a non-stop process, since the meal of expirience never ceases. It may be a very difficult experience to digest - like some personal tragedy ot humiliation. It may only be the experience of slipping as you walk downstairs. But the living b\"iog makes a non-stop effort of prehension. This prehension is obviously closely connected with in- I tentiorrriity. As you read , r\"*rp^per attentively, youp rebend ' its content. If your attention wanders, you will read without \"taking it in\" (prehending). But this is only another way of saying that \"intentionality\" has ceased to function - the act of filtering, selecting, auanging the meanings of each sentence. Intentionality is the ante-room of prehension, as necessary to it es the mouth to the stomach. Before passing frorn these general considerations to the problem of sadism,.a further approach should be indicated. I IVe might pose the general question: How much attention t'ought\" we to accord to each individual in order to feel our- gelves \"corectly\" involved - that is to say, not involved in a way that could lead (in the case of a potential lover) to an ab. oormal sexual relationship, like that of the sadist to his vic- tim?

' One of the writers on the case has said that most of Heath,s I crimes \\il/ere connected with vanity and the need to impress. i, (Cdme writers often take a regrettable \"high moral ton;,', as I if to answer in advance the accusation that they are exploiting crime for cash.) But vanity and the need to impress are not in 1 themselves signs of a cdminal; they might also be the main- spdngs of the most selfess social reformer. 'S7e are all vain; j we all want to impress; as Shaw points out, we all bid for j' admiration with no intention of earning it. This is nothing. r What is pathetic in reading about men like Heath or Christie I is that their notion of how to gain admitation is so unimagina- tive. For Heath, a typical Don Juan type, it meant endless I sexual conquests. Since he lacked Casanova's resourcefulness ' in finding money, he swindled in an unente{prising \\ilray, pass- ing dud cheques and borrowing money on false security. The poverty of his imagination made his wodd a far duller place than that of Casanova. As De Sade ptedicted, this laCk of imagination and tlre satiety ttrat was its natural consequence led to an overstraining of the pleasure flerve. it According to a book written by an acquaintance of Heath's, I he was known at school as a bully, and one day beat an eight- j year-old girl so badly that she had to be admitted to hospital. i But it is interesting to note that his first victim (his 6rst known 'victim, that is) vras a masochist who accompanied him to a hotel with the full knowledge that he wanted to ill-treat her.

(Blood-is an :T.$:; Pieldagnelle does aot meation how he rnanaged to drink it.without be-Ts.sick.) He was also allowed to slaighter 91ttle himself which _gave him the greatest pleasure;? \"ll.

He felt some guilt about his murders - six of them : aaa tried Iiving alone in a cave in a wood; the wge \\ras too suong for him, and he rettuned to kill. His last victim was his employer, M. Cristobal. It is apparent, from the brief accouat given by Hirschfeld, that Pieydagaelle derived pleasute solely from the slght of blood, not from committing any sexual act on his victims (most of whom vere women). Pieydagnelle finally gave himself up volunarily; his acts horified him so much 1 that he begged th\" i*y to seaterce him to death. Here, the split personality noted in an eadier chapter be- cpmes apparent. The sadist has a seflse of himself as t\\ro per- sotrs; his sexual urges actually frightea him. De River cites a , case in which this is interestingly apparent. A trrenty-oae- year-old youth spoke to a girl at a bus stop late at night, and olfered to walk her home. She accepted, and even turned into , e lonely patk with him. !(hen he tried to kiss her she pulled i away (probably out of coquetrS since she had agreed to walk with him and allowed him to put his arms around het). He put his hands around her tltoat, and after a struggle, throttled her into unconsciousness. He raped her, and when she re- covered, knocked her unconscious again, aad tied some clothing round her neck; hc ttren carried her some distance, \" into a building, and raped her again; he also bit offone of her aipples and swallowed it. Then he went to the nearest house, , telephoned the police, and gave himself up. (He stated: \"f I kaew I had done wrong.\") De River believes that the gitl's resistaace excited the sadistic urge; if she had allowed him to kiss her she would probably aot have beea kilted. The youth had no criminal record, was flot addicted to alcohol or dnrgs, ' ffi li;J#ffifgirr who had borne him a child *d .'#; i'il? :, he was h\"ppy. His immediate response to his crime was to give himself up; it is evident that he was shocked by the urges that suddenly overwhelmed him. (He was sentenced to life im- prisonment.)

Agun, not enough details are supplied by de Riveg to explain how, in this case, the sexual impulse had become associated, ofl a certain level, with the infiction of pain. Ad- mittedly it may never be possible to explain this satisfactodly. The sheer power of the sexual impulse defies close analysis. In air raids during the war, rescuers noted the anomalies of bomb-blasts; a whole house would be reduced to ruins, and yet a feather duster lying on a table would be unmoved. Ob- . viously there is no hope of one day creating an infallible science of bomb-blasts that will be able td explain exactly why these things happen. A man who obsewed that, in a storm, heaps of leaves were being driven before the wind, but that one single leaf was travelling in the opposite direction, might well feel that his sanity depends upon a simple and scientific explanation. But wind is one lhing; bomb-blast is another. So thi vagaries of the sexual urge may ultimately defy analysis. Usually the explosion is well controlled; the man making love to his qrife is not likely to be suddenly overwhelmed by a desire that makes him,aware of his split personality. But if the cir- cumstaoces are tulusual and sudden, the uncontrolled blast may throw up all kinds of strange and forgotten urges from the bottom of the subconscious. Bertrand's feverish excite- ment on seeing the woman in the open grave is an examplc. A receat Chicago murder case illustrated the same point. A sixteen-year-old housewife was found battered to dJath; she was wearing only an open dressing-gown and panties. A baby sl[ aND TI{E CBIUTNAL l[ENT/trXrr 179 lyiog in its cot u/as unhut. Eventually it was discovered ttrat r youog photographcr named Sacey had called that day. He turaed out to be a religious young maa with a strong sense of \"sin\". Finally he confessed that he had called to photograPh the baby; the mother had received him in her dressing-go\\ilrfl (at mid-morning). As she bent ovet the cot the gown fcll open, rcvealing that she was alnost aude. StaryY was immedi- ntety overwhelmed by sexual desire; he seized a baseball bat that he cirtied in his bag and battered het to death. Thea, hordfied by his crime, he fled without assaulting her. It is not difficult to understand the psychology of this particular mur- dct. Thc gid uuy have intended the oPeo gown as afl invita- tioa; for the somewhat repressed young man, the need to possess her suddenly became the only imporant thing in the wodd. Too uncertain - and perhaps too excited - to try an ordinary sexual advance, he knocked het unconscious. It is possiblc that Stacey became a murdeter by pure bad luch; in his positiotr^ greutmany other young men might have ended es murdeters - or at least as tapists; others might have knowa how to take advantage of the situation' and eaded orly as satisfied lovers. Cases like this - and the case cited by de Rivet - might give the impression that sadism is easily comprehensible as a kind of bastard derivative of the sexual impulse. Even the least cruel of mea might ta)e a cettain pleasue in feeling that he dominates a woman; sadism is only this domioation pushed to abnorma[ty. And most healthy men would be capable of rape under extreme circrrmstances; is this not also a type of eadism? But thcse cooclusions are less reliable than they might secm at first sight. Although Pieydagaelle murdered women with a semal motive (he descdbed his desfue to kiss a sleeping womatr, and then how thc impulse to stab her overcame him), the original impulse of sadism was connected with the smell of blood aad the butcher's shop. In his UJb of Conatt Do/e , Johr Dickson Carr cites a cutious case in which Doyle played detectivc; at Great Wyrely, in the Potteries, a ntatiac made r habit of creeping up to cattle asleep ia the fields at aight, and"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"r8o ORIGINS Otr fiIE sExT,AL IMPTILSE disembowelling them. In letters to the police he gleefully re- counted deails of his mutilations, and added that he would start on small gids in the near future. A man named George Eddii - sofl of a Persian clergyman - was arrested and tried; he was sentenced to seven years'penal servitude, although the case against him was rrery thin indeed. Doyle, convinced of his innocence, played \"Shedock Ho[mes\", and finally traced the real culprit, a youth whom Carr calls \"Peter Hudson\". This youth had been to the same school as Edalii, and had always borne him a grudge; even at school he had showed a predilec- tion fot using a knife; he used to rip open leather cushions on the railway, and his father had to pay several fines for leathet straps that his son had desftoyed. Although Edalji was freed after three years, and admitted to be innocent, \"Peter Hud- soo\" uras never pfosecuted. Hudson probably used t latge hotse lancet to mutilate the animals; the incisions'were long, but not deep. Appatently he ceased to mutilate cattle after the case; Doyle's investigations had probably frightened him. \"Peter Hudson\" is closet to the type of the genuine sadist than de Rivet's sex killer. The need to slit leather cushions and straps is a pure destructive impulse that may be totally unconnected with sex. Many chil&en find knives iresistible; a surface of tight leather seems almost to ask to be cut with a tazot edge. This is the same kind of urge that leads to building elaborate resewoirs of sand, fillirg them with water, and then poking a small hole in one of the walls for the pleasure of watching the water sweeping them awly. Catefully obsewed cases of sadism are remarkably in- frequent in psychological literatute. This may be because the theory of sadisr4 is so incomplete that psycholoigists 6ee no point in multiplying their data. Freud, for example, writes in Tbrae Contribntiots to lbe Tbeory of Sexz \"That cruelty and the sexual instinct are most intimately connected is beyond doubt taught by the history of civilization, but in the explanation of this connectiorl, no one has gooe beyond the acccntuation of the aggressive factors of the libido.\" He adds that it is possible that in sadism and masochism \"many psychic striy- sADrsu at{D THE CRTMTNAL rfiENTAxrrr r8r ings unite herein into one effect\", and says that sadism and masochism originate from a special source in the impulses that difierentiates them ftom the other perversions\" But Freud himself made little advance beyond this position, and in the book dready quoted, devotes only two Pages to sadism and masochism. The peculiat limitations of the Fteudian apptoach can be seen in the following comment: \"I have no doubt that the concePt of 'beauty' is tooted in the soil of sexual stimulation, and $gnifud originalll thdt ntbhb is uxttalll exciting. [My italics.] The mote temarkable, therefore, is the fact that the genitals, the sight of which provokes the gfeatest sexual excitement, catt really never be consideted 'beautiful' .\" (Ol. cit,rfootnote to Chapter I.) It follows from such a commeflt that obfects of beauty - landsqapes, fot example - must be somehow regarded as sexual symboli: the hills are breasts, a lake is the vagina, etc. This approach teveals a naive kind of \"fundamentalism\". The sexual uige is uodeniable, even to the most old-fashiooed nine- teenth-centtiry matefialist. The \"love energies\" (ibido) may also be taken as \"given\". The idea of a sense of beauty tooted in an intuitive hunger fot freedom must be dismissed as too metaphysical. So instead of treating all manifestatioos of bcauty - inctuding music, visual appteciation, religious srivings and the sexual impulse - as exPressions of the same evolutionary freedorn-hunger, all must somehow be teduced to the one certain factor, the libido. Freud then finds himself faced with a paradox: all beauty is somehow a reflection of the lust aroused by the sight of the genitals, and yet the genitals are less beautiful than a lake or a Beethoven symphony. Because he could not think of sex as an evolutionary urge - in fact, could not admit the existence of a non-mechanicd evolutionary striving - he is left with a barren reduction of all such impulses to the level of libido. He might have made a stafi on deflating his own hypothesis by teflecting that Venus sitting with open-thighs exposing her genitals would somehow bc less beautiful than the form Praxiteles gave her. Not only are the genials not particularly beautiful, but it is dso untrue that"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"r8z ORIGINS OF TI{E SEXTIAL IMPULSE the \"core\" of the perception of beauty is directed towards the genitals. Most men would agree that a urofilan lyiog naked with her legs open is usually less sexually desirable thaa a fully or partly clothed womao. Freud's elror hete arises from an employment of an \"analy- tic\" instead of a Gestalt psychology. It is somehow the total \"Gestalt\" of the woman that is sexually atractive. Freud implies that the vagina is a kind of light-source, and that if a lover finds the neck and hair beautiful, it is because they re- flect this light. Gestalt psychology declares that the light- source is somehow behind the whole body, in some more ultimate evolutionary urge; and that, what is more, it is exactly the same light-source that lends beaury to a landscape, a symphof,y, a social-reformer's urge.to improve society. It is true that the genitals are L kind of whidpool in the midst of the sexual rapids, and that appreciation of a girl's face and. figurc can suck a man towards the vofiex of deske; this is because the evolutionaty \"light-source\" is reflected most intensely at this point. But it is also true that the power of the whirlpool depends upoo detachment from it; the gteater the detachment, the greater its power. A woman's attractioo diminishes in ptoportion as she is seen as an isolated obiect, aq a ttrnefe wofilan\", a, \"mere body\" of even as a \"mere vagina\"l it incteases as she is seen as a portion of a whole, a social ot a biological context. The ladies of King Arthut's knights derived attraction from their social context, the con- ventions that made them modest, withdrawn embodiments of a kind of angelic \"eternal feminine\". Aldous Huxley's Katy (n Tbe Geniu and tlte Goddtst) derives her attractions from making men arilr4re of her as a part of a biolclgical context, as a sort of symbol of womanhood. It can be seen that the Gestalt treatment of the sexual ptoblem is somehow more adequate than the Freudian analytical approach. These considerations explain why Freud and his followers never succeeded in produciog , \"unifying theory\" of sadism. S7ith the libido as the only \"ultimzte\",to which all \"aberrated impulses\" must be somehow reduced, it is hardly surprising sADrsM AND TrrE CRIMTNAL r,fEI.IT&rry t8, that the problem of sadism should remain impenetrable to Freudian analysis. An interestiog - if sotnewhat vague - suggestion to e4plain sadism as ar \"evolutionary perversioa\" is made by John Cowpet Powys in his novel A GlastonbarT Roaancc. Powys himself admits freely in his autobiogtaphy that \"from earliest childhood up to the present hour, my dominant vice has beea the most dangetous of all vices. I tefer to Sadism.\" Powys confined his abnormality to sadistic fantasies up to his ffieth yea\\ after which he \"cured himself\" - at least of the tendency to indulge voluntarily.

Incompa rubly the best study in sadism that has so far been produced is P4ofessor Berg's Der Sadi$, a study of the mass murderer Peter Kiirtei. Berg does not theorize; he offers only facts. But no previous study of a sadist offered so many facts i that illumiaate the deeper motivations. r' Kiirten, who was executed in Jaly ry3r, admitted to com- mitting nine murders and fourteen atacks that involved serious wounding. Professor Kad Berg, who acted as psychologist for the Diisseldorf police, saw a great deal of Kiirten,in jail, and soofl won his complete con-fidence. At first Ktirten declared that his crimes had been committed to revenge himself on society. (He had spent tvrentF-seven of his forry-eight years in i prison.) Latet. he admitted that the motive was wholly sexual. i He proved to be a man of exceptional intelligence and of ';i unusual honesty. Unlike Nietzsche's \"pale ctiminal\", he : accepted his pervetsions as a part of his flature, and experienced no paogs of conscience. His case history, as related to Berg i over a period of many months, is as follows: Kiirtea was born in 1883 in Kdln-Mulheim, the son of a brutal and violent moulder. The famtly of thirteeo lived for a time in a single room in conditions of extreme degra- , dation. r From a :rery eatly age the elernent of sex became important r, in Kiirten's life. When his father came home drunk he ' frequently beat Frau Kiirten, and iust as frequently forced ber to have sexual intercourse. To the young Kiirten, who could , often see and hear this quite plainly, it seemed that his mother i was being violated. His father also attempted incest with one of Kiirten's sisters, as a result of which spent fifteen months ; in jail. Ktirten claimed that all his sisters were oversexed, and ,, that one of them attempted to seduce him.

At this age the crirne need not necessarily have been connected with any sexual impulse.

Kiirten h3d very litde to lose, and his uahappiness led him to regard the wodd with a cold hostility, as , rothl.rt enemy.

This was undoubtedly the majot step ia I turning Ktirteainto the most horrible of mass murderers.

He r was ill-treated,andfi.nally stole'moneyand rLfl ^wayto Coblenz, where he lived with a masochistic prostitute. Shordy after this i he was arrested for theft, and received the first of his seventeen : sentences. Arnong hardened criminals and \"old lags\", Kiirten , felt bound to turn himself into something more like a pro- r, ' fessional criminal, and had himself tattooed. When he was re- i ' leased in r 899 he took a gitl out into the Grafenberger Woods I and strangled het during sexual intercourse. He declared that this taught him for the first time the pleasurc of hurtingwhile r, he had sexual intetcourse. Although he thought he had killed i the gid, no body was found, so it is probable that she.recovered and said nothiag about her experience. Now followed several short prison sentences for various ' offences, including lying ia wait fot a girl and attempting to r: shoot her with a rifle. He. deliberately committed minor in- i fringements of prison regulations so that he could get into ,; sofitary confinement and indulge himself in sadistic fantasies.

Now he had a \"grudge against society\" (and a certain amouflt of justification fot it), l; aad associated sexual pledsure and \"getting his own back\" on it society. He even invented a notion of \"compensative iustice\", ,: by which the punishment for his crimes would be visited on people who had tormented him.

For some SADTEM alqD TtrE cRTMTNAL MENTALTTt r89 crrrious reason Ktrten was very attractive to womefl. He was not ba&looking, certainly had none of Lombtoso's criminal iharacteristics, was quietly spoken, and obviously intelligerit, and dressed as well as he could afiord, taking care to keep his shoes well shined and his hair brushed. He philandered as rnuch as possible, and found it easy to pick up girls..(At his trial he declared that his crimes \\il/ere partly the fault of the women who were all so easy to pick up.) He did not always kill his victims, or evefl harm them. Some gids found his manner of love-making slightly rough, but did not object to being throttled a litde. To one gid who protested, Ktirten explained that \"love was.like that\". At least one of them was in love with him and hoped to marry him; when she accidentally discovered that her \"frarrc€\" was akeady martied, she was iaconsolable. Kiirten's marriage seems to have been a good infuence. For 'several years he worked as a moulder in Altenberg, became an active trade-unionist, and conrmitted no murders. He was t'urice charged with maltreating servant gitls, and on one occasion his wife saved him from prison by beggiog the girl to drop the case. His sadistic fantasies continued, however. Finally he decided to return to Drisseldorf - perhaps because the larger city would permit him more anonymity. On the evening he returned - in r92t - he was ddighted that the sunset was blood-ted. Now began Dtisseldorf's \"reign of tetor\", which has very few parallels in criminal history. He began to indulge his sadistic propensity with a few attacks on women, nofle of them fatal. These became steadily more ftequent. His wife worked as a waitress at nlght; Krirten would escort her to work, and then go out looking for a victim. Until rgzT therc were only three cases of attempted sttangulation of young women. Then Kiirten took up arson again,and burned haystacks and barns. He hoped that he would incinerate some tramp sleeping in the hay. He committed eighteen cases of arson during the next two years.

SADISM AND TTIE CRIMINAL MENTALTTT I9I Although Kiirten was not arrested until May tg1a, he conr- mitted no more murders, and went back to attemPted strangula- tion to satisfy his sadistic appetites. It is possible that he was now experiencing a certain disgust over tLe mutders; he was by no means as completely degenerate as Heath and Chtistie; he took a considerable interest in his owfl \"case\", tried hard to tationalize his sadism, and read various psychologists.'So it is remotely possible that, even at this late date, he was succeeding in salvaging something from the wteck of his own being. The attacks produced a fuenzy of activity on the partof the police. The police received rr,ooo letters denouncing the murderer; they interviewed goo,ooo people, and followed up 2,61o clues. One of the denunciations was from a girlwho had been assaulted by Krirten; the police fined her for \"gross oeflsense\". The net finally closed around Kiiten when he assaulted a servaflt gid named Maria Budlick. She was an ugly, bow- legged gid who came to work in Dtisseldorf and was picked uF by Kiirten, taken to a lonely spot, and fotced to submit to \"mild throttling\" and sexual intetcourse. But Ktirten had also taken her to his horne in Mettmarnerstrasse. She did not bother to repot the incident to the polioe, but wtote about it in a letter to a ftiend that \\ras sent to the vlrong address. Someone else opened the letter, read it, and gave it to the police. One day in late May ry3q Ktirten came out of his upstaits flat to see Matia Budlick pointing him out to a police- man. He was not arrested immediately,but realized that it was close. He now confessed his murders to his wife and advised her to give him up to the police and claim the rewatd. He took her out to a restaurant to complete the story of his cdmes; she was so upset that she could not eat; Ktirten ate her share as well as his own. The next day she \\reflt to the police, and her husband was affested by a nervous detcctive. In due course ehe received the reward, which partly relievcd her anxicty about starvation in old age.

SADISM AND TrIE CRIMINAL MENTATITT t9l Powys's idea of a man whose erotic nerve receives energies from the destructive side of the \"First Causi\". The Ktirten who was elated by the sight of a blood-red sunset, the Kikten who walked thtough thi streets of Dtsseldorf dreaming of blowing up the whole city - and yet could take an intelligent interest in his own \"case\" - is somehow better understood in tetms of a \"dark energy\" flowing from outside himself. These various considerations lead the discussion into what is cetainly its most difficult stage. Ii would seem that there is much evidence to support Freud's idea that sadism proceeds from a different source than the other sexual perversions. 'Freud's \"special source\" was explained at length in Belond ttte Plearure Principh; it was the \"death wish\", the Greek tbanatot Freud was puzzled by the problem of human aggression, and felt that Marx's theory of the class-war \\ras superficial; he therefore produced this \"new\" concept of his own. (In fact, t'he concept was formulated by Schopenhauer, who was in turn inspired by certain Christian mystics and by Briddhism.) Human beings fought wars because they secretly wished to d.ie; the need for self-preservation may be very deep, but a lust for death is even deeper. Sadism is therefore laccording to i Freud) a mixture of the tvro mostpotentimpulsesin the human ' being: sex and the death urge. Kiirten would be understood to be committing suicide when he went out to kill; he had flung himself into a streafir that would bear him to death, and allowed tle need for sex and the need for death to mingle in a kind of delirium. At first sight, this view is plausible. A Freudian might argue that Nietzsche had akeady postulated a kind of death wish in his \"pale cdminal\". But this is only because we confuse the romantic wish for darkness, fof \"return to the womb\", with the wish for death. The pale criminal did not actively want to ;.\" ai\"; he had only reached a point of fatigue and degradatioa where he did not actively want to live. Human beings some- times think seriously of dying in the way that a hard-pressed business man thinks of bankruptcy; but the business man usuallywants to start up in another business,without thebur-"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"194 ORIGINS OF TTIE SEXUAL IMPULSE den of old debts. There is no deske to retire permanently from business. In the same way, trre nineteenth:ientury romantics dreamed of a rctteat to the womb, \"half in love with easeful death\"; but what they really wanted was a reduction in the difficulry of living, a time to rest and recuperate. sometimes it seemed to them that all life is inevitably miserable, that it allows us to recuperate only in order to exploit us futther. But such poets as Traherne, Blake, wordswortt, - even shell\"y - had intuitions of a greater intensity of life, a power that would make all t.rments seem trivial. Towards tG end of the cen- tury this question of \"eternal yes\" r,erfl.rs ('eternal no, had been clear\\ fgrmulated by a considerable number of poets and artists ; ladyle, Nietzsche, Van Gogh, and Rilke among them. And in many cases the answer r*ir not simply a stoica'i \"yea-saying\", 2s in Cadyle, but a mystical uffirm\"tiln. Freud y.t ! no deeper than his own sick tomanticism, mistaking death for the dark womb of life. (Rflke was inclin.a to do the same kind of thing.) A healthier - and profounder - attitude ,towards death was stated by camus, whi wrote \"For me, it is a closed door . . . a horrible and dirry adventure\". shawalso recognized this. rn The DonesticiT of Franklia Barnabus there is the following exchange: \"CoNRAD: . . . Do you know what people really die of? \"TMMENSo: of reasonableness. They do not want to live for- evet. \"coNRAD: of laziness and want of conviction, and failure to make theit lives worrh living. That is why.,, Even Dostoevsky, a confirmed romantic, disowned the \"death wish\", and stated that \"eternal liFe, does net mean life 1r he.av.en, but physical life here on earth,in a state of intensity that is inconceivable to us at present. - If this viev is prefetred to Freud's neo-romanticism, then the death-wish explanation of sadism must be abandoned. Degeneration is not synonymous with the death wish; one is a state of neutrality; the other a positive downward-movement. shaw doubted whether it is possible for living creatures to wish their own death on the deipest instinctive lJvel, and there SADISM AND THE CRIMINAL MENTALITY is much evidence to support his view. Tolstoy's Anna Katea- ina, on the point of committing suicide, when it is too late to vith&aw, realizes suddenly that death is the last thing in the wodd that she warts. Tolstoy's intuition werit deeper than , Freud's. Degeneration is the result of \"nihilism\".* All animals r arie saved from such a peculiat condition by the strength of theirinstincts, which give life ace*ainfamewotk of \"values\". ' But as brain increases, the iostincts are weakened; and if [' society suddenly becomes far more difficult and complex - as it has over the past hundred years - men need to increase their ,, intellectual co.ordination to an eflormous extent to suwive. 'To the average Elizabethan, even a stupid Londoner (or Nerv Yorket) of today would seem a highly rematkable example of eocial co-ordination. The instincts are suddenly weakened. The tesult is that man feels himself in a kind of \"spiritual\" desett, not knowing what to do because his instincts no longer tell him. In this state, he may well turn to pleasure as the only r, positive value - as men have always turned in decadent civi- Iizations. But the pleasure nerve is not strong enough to caffy i the whole current of human evolutionary striving; it becomes caltroused and insensitive. Sexual pewersionr rre rn attempt to ' stimulate the jaded pleasute newe. Sex is used instinctively as a safety valve, because it is a temporary recoanection with the instinctive forces that are the source of all \"values\". ,r In African Genesis, Robert Ar&ey has aa interesting example of this increase of sexual emphasis under conditions that weaken the instincts. Sir Solly Zuckerman observed the be- I haviour of a gtoup of baboons in the London Zoo, upoo ;, which he based the generaltzaaonthat sex is the great motive , force ia animal society. Baboons,like maay animals and birds, , have a strict hierarchy of rank, and the \"aristocratic\" baboon i11f ,rs likely to get a sizeable harem (which chooses him) while his proleadaa colleagues remaio sex-starved. Zucketman ob- served that this sometimes led to sexual battles.

If he lost, he would become one of the \"proletariat\" of bachelors; another bachelor would take his place as aristocrat. This, and other incidents of the same trpe, led to zucketman's generalization. But, as Ardrey poi\"t, Lirt, zoo conditions are thoroughly a,:.,rtcial. !7hen tibooo, ,.\" observed in their natural suiroundings, such sexual battles are never seen. The \"social order\" is never challenged by the \"proletariat\"l the greatest fotce in baboon ,o.i\"iy is prece- dence, the \"will to power\".

(Ardrey oflers ari impressive ^!r^y' of examples to support his view.) \"sex is a side-show in the wodd of the animals,?ot the dominant colour of that wodd is fear\", 4r_dt\"y writes.]Ie- also produces some interesting ex_ amples of the way in which the ?'natural instincts,, of aniLah ate weakened when they are thrown into straoge social coadi- tions (on board ship, for example). Transfer thi\"s to the human social context, and we b.grn to understand why the rate of sex crime rises steadily, and why various sexual abnormalities are on the increase. Animals and birds choose their sexual patner by social precedence. In this highly complex modetn social machine, which can grind individuals to fiagments in a com- pl\"r.Jy. {personal manner, we have a largeiomber of privi_ Ieged individuals, who find no difficulty\"io obtainiag sexual release, and an even larger number of \"ciihersr,.who feel them- selves to be sexually underpdvileged. i fr*oo, fi.lm star ban r]..\"p wi$ every hat-check [i.t in frolywood; a moronic truck driver like Charles,Floyd is forced ,L *ori\"r , yoong and pl\"t1 gitl in order to possess her.

Again, Robert arai.y ^avances views of considerable irrterest. Ardrey quotes the theory of the south African anthropologist -Raymond Darr, that 11 'il fi ,l ,? : SADISM AND TI{E CRIMINAL MENTALNY ry1 t humankind developed from a tribe <f killer apes. The more fattering view - held by rnost anth\"ropologists - is that \"eralJy lnan\" possessed a latger brain than the ape, and so crlme to I develop weapons aad tools. Dart suggested that a uibe of r: killer apes branched oIf from the notmal aon-aggtessive ape. Thcse apes used weaporls - rocks or heavy bones - aad wef,e : forced to develop larger btains io order to co.ordinate r, muscles and senses. And so came man. Ardrey's somewhat , depressing thesis is that since man develop\"d as a killer, i. aggressi,on is an inetadicable part of his nature. Preachers and ' humanistic sociologists continue to speak of, urtiversal peace, ; goodwill towards men; but the competition of weapols - in rnodern teflns, the arms race - is too deeply ingrained in the ,: human psyche. If the survival of the human species depends upofl peace, then it is impossible that we should survive - this is Ardrey's thesis. And he points out that tribes of animals are naturally hostile to ooe another. A naturalist placed a number of monkeys on an island, and made sute that they had ample food and space for all. Instead of turniag into aa anatchist society, peaceably wanderiog over theit domain, th\"y separated into tribes, saked out territories, and expressed hostility to all other tribes. This conclusion may be depressing - and perhaPs not r entirely accurate - but it only states the truth intuited by ' Nietzsche and stated repeatedly in modem culture: that t's'qreetness and light\" is an excellent fotmula, but it is too fat from the deep psychological reality of man to be a working rule fot society. In his impatience with the \"sweetness and light\" school, Nietesche'srent to extremes, declared that war is nobler than peace and that he pteferred a warrior to a monk.* Bergson, Sorel, and Pareto went further, and built up , a kind of rationale of the irational.t T. E. Hulme declared *I need hardly add that Nietzsche's find position by no means depends on these views, and that he himself ftequently said things that are in opposition to them. The anti-humanist is ftequently dtiven to orrerstate his position in sheer exasperation. fSee my Rcligion aad tbc Rcbel, Chaptet Two."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"r98 oRrcrNS oF THE sExuAL rMpuLSB that human nature is unchangeably corrupt, and that the dogma of original sin expre*\"J, basic truth; he later wrote a ' series of articles against pacifism, and explaioiog why he was proud-to fight in the rgr4war. unfortunately d\"estiny was on the side of his opponent (Berrrand Russell) i\"a .ri\"'.rr.J,h\" \"1g.\"m9lt by kiiling Hulme, demonstratingihat even if a maa of intellect decides on a parudoxical defeice of violence, he had better take care not to act accord-ing to his stated convic- tions.

Like Hulme, though, Hemingway soon took his convictions to the point of absurdiry, created a kind of mystique of bull-fighting, big-game hunting, and death, and ended as a victim of his own cult of violence and anti-intellectualism. But the fact that Hulme and Hemingway were almost as \\rrrong as Matthew Arnold and rvilliam Morris does aot mean that the \"irrationalist\" school must be abandoned. The nine- teenth century grasped the basic truth that man,s evolution has been due to his ability to analyse and use symbors. TTr ,:_ a point of immense importance, and cannot be stated with too much emphasis. It is central to the argument of this book. There are two basic modes by whi.h men \".g_rrrp\" the outside wodd: intellect and intuiii\"\". n\"a .oi- sider what meanings undedie this clich6. you recognize your brother's lace !y intuition,lgt by analysis; in otheiirords, by a faculty involving \"Gestalt\". ti.o *o_1t recognize a stranger by- analytical perception, by sayrng \"ThIs *\"rr\"hr, rcd hair and a broken nose - therefore he watt be X whom I met rast week\". But such a procedure would be unusual. All our basic recognitions come thtough this \"Gestalt,, intuition, in which is involved Hussed's factor of intentionality (i... sub- consciously deciding which aspects of someone,s face to sADrsM 3.r{D T}rE CBTMINAL MENTALTTY 199 notin no$).In this, human beings are like animals. It has been observed that certain birds and animals can \"count\" up to four or five; baboons (according to Ardrey) cao count up to thtee; certain birds carr count as high as six. this is detennined by a simple experiment. Baboons are raiding an orchard; three farmets go out, and the baboons run tway,but wait nearby. Two fatmers emetge from the orchard while the third lies in ambush. But the baboons are too sensible to walk into the ambush. However, if the experiment is repeated with four r1efl, and three of them leave the otchatd, the baboons fail to notice that there must be a man lying in ambush, and return to the orchard - where, presumably, they 'meet with a blast ftom a shotgun. The English naturalist Lubbock tells a similar story about a ctovr that shows that it could count up to four. It is also generally known that if a bird's flest contains eggs, and one is taken, the bird fails to iotice the loss; if two are taken, the bitd will desert the nest. But to say that birds and animals can \"count\" is mis- leading. Counting involves the use of number-words like one, two, and thtee. It also involves an analltical procedure, taking each unit on its o'!irn, rather like attachbg ^ marked label to each obiect counted. An animal \"counts\" in the same \\ilray that it recognizes the face of its mate - by 'ugosping\" the whole, and relying on its function of intentionality to retain a mote or less accurate picture of that whole. This, of coutse, is also common with human beings. In Kipling's Kin, Kim is taught how to become an efficient secret-senrice agent by buiog shown a ttay of assorted objects, and told to memotize them after a very brief glance. This involves additional train- ing of the Gestalt faculty. The reader might try the expedment of glancingata bookshelf of assorted books, and then seeing how many of them - in their proper ordet - are tetained in the memory aftq. a glance of t'wo seconds. There is no time to count and apply special \"labels\" to each book. The work must be left entitely to the Gestalt faculty, the intuition of form. This intuition, within its limitations, is a great deal swifter and more ef[cient than the intellect. The intellect t"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"2OO ORIGINS OF THE SEXUAL IMPULSE vould require a five-minute contemplation of the bookshelf, and would need to apply names and numbers to the books. Nevertheless, for all its elephantine slowness, the intellect is more efficient in the long run; it can grasp huge ttacts of sttange material - whole libraties - where the Gestalt faculty is limited to a booksheH. An anirnal would simply not see the sense in such ponderous human procedures as language and number symbolism, af,y more than a poor mafl sees the need for a bank account and life insurance. Humafl language is a tribute to our belief in our enduranee and far-sightedness; its slow development i's an indication of our basic animal mis- trust of any but immediate and self-evident procedures. But where does all this apply to sex theory, and particulady to sadism? Its basic point is this: the Gestalt faculty (a more precise word than intuition) plays a tiny but nevertheless wholly indispensable part in human evolution. The intellect does all the real work. For thousands - perhaps millions - of years man used both these faculties about equally. Then, quite suddenly - within the past few thousand years - rnan decided to take the plunge and entrust his capital and his future to the intellect. Even so, the intellect's expansion vras very slow; a man like Aristotle could make all kinds of extraordinary generalizations without bothering to test them by the \"elephantine procedure\" of experiment. The sudden tremendous rise in the stock of intellect occutred less than four centuries ago, and is associated with names like Galileo, Keplet, and Newton. The stocks not merely doubled and trebled their value; they went on rising until they had increased a thousandfold. Throughout th; eighteenth century they went on rising, until, in the nineteenth century, they reached a peak. Men like Comte, Mill, and Marx declared unbounded faith in the analytical procedure; their faith and optimism were so great, in fact, that they lost sight of the all-important \"Gestalt faculq\"; they declared that analysis was eaer.ytbing that man needed nothing but analysis to increase his stature and improve his society indefinitely. SADISM AND TI{E CRIMINAL MENTALITY 2OI But this is like declaring thatacountry's economy can be built entirely on a paper cutrency, without gold in the banks' The foots ,r\" r\"v\"r.d. It will not be surprising if a culture built on such foundations soon begins to show signs of serious illness. Before any improvement can take place, the notion of the Gestalt faculty, the intuition, must be restored to its small but tightful place.'This, in fact, is the revolution that has been progrEsping slowly but steadily in mafly fields for the past hundred years. Now iiis unfortufiate that sexual theory was almost wholly created by a man who was almost as analytic,'as blind to Gestalt, ,r lohn Stuart Mill. Freud's achievement is incredible; but he is siill, in many ways, the worst thing that ever hap- pened to the new science of psychology. ^ These considerations maki it possible to offer a basic and comprehensive definition of existentialiim. Gestalt is the basii of our lives, and therefore of out evolution. Gestalt (or intuition) is the foots of the tree; analysis and intellect are the tree itself, the whole portion above ground. The nineteenth century declared thai the tree does not need roots. The existentialists came back and declared defiandy that the foots do not need the tree. (So Kierkegaard attacked Hegel, and Heidegger deciared that he is interested only in \"pure being;.) yet these are absurd extreme positions. The greatest existintial thinkers - Nietzsche, Whitehead, William James flohn Dewey might also be added - with reservations - to iirir tirt; only took up the reasonable position that the tree needs its rooir in their proper position - under the ground, in contact with the tiving soil, the vital forces. F,ach of them developed a different way of saying this, but the general intention was identical. This, as I have suggested, is particularly true for sex, which temains incomprehensible without such an approach. In the early chapters of th\" book I have tried to demonstrate the use of such i, ^ppro^ch. But the problem of sadism reveals that it is completily indispensable. Freud's need to invent the death wisfr reveals thisinadequacy; he discovered the need to"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"2O2 ORTGINS OF TTIE SEXUAL IMPt'LSE someho'w deepen his concept to explain aggression, but was unwilling to attempt ^ generul deepeniag of his theory; so his death wish remains the eagle in the flock of Freud's pigeons. This is usually the fate of the attempts to reduce complexities to one oyersirnplified coocept. (Russell and Sflhitehead's attempt to reduce all mathernatics to logic in Principia Matbematica is another example; their \"system\" was left pncompleted when the internal coatradictions became obvious; but not before Russell had tried a few compromises of the same tlpe as the death wish.) What, then, is the existential alternative to the Freudian view? It is, to begin with, the need to recognize that the sexual impulse is not the basic human drive. It is ao more \"basic\" than the urge to social reform or to doing mathe- matics. It may be $roxger,but that is an entitely dilfetent thing. Freud declared as it wete, that sex is the universal power- house, and that all other lesser 'ocurrents\" run ofl it. Adler tried to modify this view by asserting the importance of the will to power, the need for social orientation, self-respect. Atdrey's book indicates that this view is now becoming self- evident in zoology. But even this is not basic enough. Powys - for all his vagueness and obscure mysticism - is closer to a basic unifying view with his talk of a \"first cause\" with positive and negative poles. But even this must not be taken too literally. For the existential psychologist, the truth would seern to bL sometfiing like this:-the powir-house is an evolutionary impulse of such enoimous strength that it is almost impossible to make any basic assertions about it. T. E. Hulme urrote: \"The process of evolution can only be described as the ins'ertion of more and more freedom into matter. . . . In the amoeba, then, you might say that impulse has manufactured a small leak through which free activity could be inserted into the world, ffid the process of evolution has been the gradual enlargement of this leak\" (Speculatiou, p. zo8). But it is not merely a question of brute force enlarging the leak. The life urge is something of a bull in a china shop; or it could be described as an elephant trying to learn to SADISM AND TIIE CRIMINAL MENTALITY ctochet. And with tematkable delicacy fot such an immense force, it has built up a careful series of valves and dams, mther like the fuses that prevent a faulty electric fite from burning : down the house. Hence the nervous system which serves the ir,l double pu{Pose of connecting hand and brain, and acAng as a i \"fuse\" lfrai prevents too much life from blazing into the i brain and creating a coflsciousness that is too intense for the menial tasks of evolution. It is rathet as if a despot should i place a certain limit on the tise in wages and prosperity I L..r,rt\" if we were all rich there would be nobody to clean ,1, out the sewets and empty the dustbins. But what of sadism? Once the immense energy of this \"powerhouse\" is grasped, a plausible answer suggests itself. Our\"values\" (i.e. notions of rightandwrong) are all connected with the instincts. And the instincts in tutn are closely con- nected with the nefvous system and the various valves for \"keeping out\" too much life force. Ardrey points out that the instinct of order is general in tbe animal wodd, even where there is no social need for precedence and hierarchy; it is a basic law of nature that must be unfait to the few if it is to be fair to the manv. The nerves and the instincts afe dl directed ' towards maintaining order and preventing chaos. Yet it would be false to speak as if thete were a fundamental opposi- tion of purpose in the nerves and in the \"life impulse\", The whole system of \"valves\" is the creation of the life impulse. And yet, as has been seen repeatedly in this study, these valves and tepeating mechanisms frequeatly spPear. as tyrants where sex is concerned. So when the instincts ate weakened by a sudden increase in the complexity of e civilization it be- comes possible to revolt against the \"valves\". $fhere the instincts are weakened, the living creature turos naturally to , the source of values, the life impulse itself. The tired nerves are asked to ease their restrictions on life impulse. But if the nerves and instincts afe out \"policemefl\" they are also out law-givers of dght and wrong. The life force itself is not in the least concerned with our social rights and wrongs. Like Caesar, it is above the law; it leaves it to its policemen to 20,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"2O4 ORTGINS OF TI{E SEXUAL TMPTTLSE see that its minions obey the law. And if these policerhen are weakened or by-passed, anything can happen, The astonished minion.discoyers abruptly that the life impulse is not interested in social aboos and \"ideas of good and evil\". This is expressed perfealy by Nietzsche in a letter; he tells his friend fiow he went to a nearby hilltop as a storm approached, and took shelter in a hut where ^ rnan was killing two kids. Normally, blood would have revolted him; at this moment, the storm broke. Nietzsche writes: \". . . f had an indescdbable feeling of well-being and zest. , . Ligbtnitg and tvnpest an difirent worlds'free poweri witbout norality Pure will, without the con- fusions of intellect - how hrppy, how free.\" For a moment the Dionysian element in life has outrun the Apollonian; the water has spilled over the vessel. These, of course, ate a71 images, and have the usual ad- vantages and disadvantages of images. And yet they explain the nature of sadism more directly than any amount of analytical language. The aerves and instincts are like guardians who set up a qualified prohibition on alcohol. The sadist is the man who has found a source of bootleg alcohol. But unlike the usual alcohol, it comes without \"moral\" taxation. All the guilt trechanisms - associated with the instincts - are by-passed. But like most bootleg liquor, this is far more poisonous than the legitimate atticle. Hence the degeneration of the Heaths and Christies. tUflhat of the suggestion - made by Powys and Boehme - that there are two types of energy that emanate from the \"powerhouie\"? In fact, such a hypothesis is unnecessary to e*plain sadism. The,nerves malre up the \"legitimate\" electrical circuit. The power flows in one direction, from positive to negative. If this is by-passed, there is no telling what can happen. Our notion of good and evil is associated with this one-vray flow of power. If the power piles up and flows back on itself like a tide, good and evil will seem to be reversed. Powys, then, is both right and wrong in his attribution of a \"duality\" to the llfe impulse. Our rtrTestern religious tradition insists that \"God is good\". This may be true - but certainly not SADISM AND TTIE CRIMINAL MENTALITY 20' in the sense that \"God is moral\". What is \"good\" for the life '1 impulse is completely beyond our comprehension, and is only I vaguely related to ourideas of good and evil. But in another sense Powys is wtong. For why is it neces- , satyto posit two types of energyin thelife impulse that account , for altruism and cruelty? The energy of malice is usually vital ir energy gone totten. 'S7e have only to think of the malice and petty-mindedness that are often associated with small com- . munities to rcalize that \"evil\" is often anothet name for ,); frustration or boredom. It is what Blake meant in writing: !, , \"'W'hen thought is closed in caves, then love shall show its i, root in deepest hell.\" Did not the ctuelty of Eastern despots jrr spring from the boredom of having too much Power and no )', particular pu{pose? Sexual habits, like other habits, are often a matter of .fafie de mietx. I An example might make this dearer. Paul de River cites a , curious case of bestiality that concerned a gid and an Alsatian \" dog. The gid was a healthy but \"highly sexed\" teenager who i had frequently been excited by the sight of mating stallions on '; a farm. One night her Alsatian dog canle into the bedroom I and showed curiosity about her genitals (she was weating a i Ugfrtaress) and she allowed him to lick her, and finallv helped } the dog to have sexual intetcoutse with her. It b3ca1e.a habit; ' some time latet, when she was caught, she admitted that men had now lost all attraction for her. Only an animal could excite her sexually. r, And yet it would cleatly be innaccurate to say that there is a ;,' certain sexual impulse in women that is directed to animals , tather than to men, and that under certain circumstances this impulse may develop to the point of abnormality. The girl's f : normal sexual impulse had been \"hypnotized\" at an early ,;{ . stage by the sight of a st\"llion mounting^ ^mare.The size of iti j sexual organ impressed her. She admitted to having fantasies ,1 about sexual intercourse with a stallion while she was actudly ,l , 't having it with a dog. The dog's sexual member, of course, is a j, grcat deal smaller than that of most men. But the chain of '', association was welded by repetition: stallion, sexual .t ij11 ,l"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"2c,6 ORIGINS OF THE SEXTIAL IMPULSE intercourse, dog. The dog may have been a o'second-best,, compared to a stallion, but it was closer to a stallion than e man. Hence'a second-best ia the sexual act became a habit and a necessity. It is rather as if a very poor man should drink methylated spirit until he is so used to its taste that he finds whisky insipid. But methylated spirit, like whisky, is alcohol; a preference for methylated spirit would be a prefirence for its impuritics,not for its alcohol content. The same is surely true of sadism. The reasons for the addiction to \"bootleg liquor\" ^re multiford. In most cases, \"poverty\" is an important part; this certainly accounts for a grrat deal of criminal sadism. But how does a man develop a sadistic impulse in-t!e. first place? $7hy was Kiirten the only sadist in a family of thirteen? Hereditary degeneracy plays an . important part, of course. But this would oory \"oroi\" a cettain feebleness of the life impulses, flot a desire foi cruelty. Sadism splngs from the reaction of the Dionysiac impulr. or, ,o enfeebled nervous system. And as fat aswe cafl deiermine, the men who are born with the ability to receive sudden ..tides,, of undiluted life impulse are freaks in the same sense as Siamese twins. If Ktirten's excess vitarity could have been carefully channelled, and kept clear of too much association with sex, there is no reason why he should not have ended as famous instead of infamous. The degenerate impulse has been Present in many creative men. De sade is, of course, a border- line case, who might be dismissed as wholry criminal. But Isidore Ducasse, who wrote under the name of Lautrdamont, is already halfway to the major poet. His \"chants de Mal- doror\", a long prose poem put into the mouth of an arche- typal \"romantic optsider\", are full of sadistic fantasies that cannot be excused as \"art\". They are simply degenerate and nasty. If you read Ducasse, it is impossible to Jwa[ow him whgle and approve of all, unless yooirn enioy descdptions of l-li\"g oyt l baby'! eyes with fingernails. And yet pais of the \"Chants de Maldoror\" rank with Rimbaud,r .t[*oirr\"tiorls,, as the greatest prose poetry to come out of France in the late nineteenth century. SADISM AND TIIE CRIMINAL MEN'TALITY 2o7 ( 'This is the distinction between the criminal and the creative '' mentality. There is an element in the criminal mentaliry that . must be tejected, evefl if it is part of the expression of unusual viality. Sfe can accept the indecencies of Rabelais ot the , obsceaity of Joyce as a \"digestible\" part of their creation. But we do not \"...it tdre blund\"ers and mistakes made by a man of genius eaily in his writing caree\\ we merely separate them from the better passages in his juvenilia; or we may ignore the iuvenilia completely because it reduces our pleasure in the mature achievement. We make a clear distinction between what is creative and what is accidental. Now the genuinely 'criminal - the degeherative - is wholly accidental.-It is not vital power flowing, for some feason, counter to our usual social notions of right and wrong. It is usually charactedzed . by . pathetic sense of boredom and waste. And if it circulates in liviog systems, waste is synonymous with poison. Sadism is a poison, flot e separate part of the vital energies. ft is, as Freud stated, different from the othet \"perversions\" for obvious reasons. Homosexuality is only a misdirection of the sexual impulses, probably based largely upon physical foctors such as hormones. Fetichism and necrophily are also mis- directions, but also have mild iustification as attempts to pursue e \"pure\" sexual expetience, free of the usual dilutions by pet- sonal and social factors. Their degenerative influence may be no larger than in masturbation. But sadism is quite simply a poison of the sexual impulses, a habit-forming poison of immense degenerative influence. The failure, in a man like , Powys, to eliminate it from his system, is an unfortunate proof of an irnmaturity that is frequently apparent in his early work. (A volume of essays like Tbe Pleassres of Uteratrce reveals a dilettantism that is charactetized by imprecision of thought and'language,^tendency to wallow in vaguely literary moods.) Both sadism and masochism are illnesses of childhood, a way of intensifying a life impulse that will be strengthened by other transformers in later life.

Note: Tl:e Probhn of tbe Preaeiliott of Sex Crimc The steady rise in the numb\"r of sex crimes in Europe and America has occasioned a greatdeal of disquiet. It is true that all classes of crime have incteased; nevertheless, sex crime and violence against the person has shown the steepest rate of increase. The figures are as follows: In England in r93g there \\rere ;,or8 sex crimes; in r91r the number had increased to 14,6 j1; in ry15 this had againincreased to r7,o7g. Since then, the figure has been faiily constant. This shows an increase of n]ore than 3oo per cent. Larceny and breaking and entry have also increased, but only by ,o per cent. But ctimes of violence have also trebled.* In the United states there are more than i , r r,ooo sexual assaults per year. The reason is undoubtedty the increasing social tensions of out lrighly mechanized civilization, the lonstaot threat of atomic war, and the tendency to increased centralization that has the effect of increasing the individual's sense of \"insigni- ficance\". The \"emotionally disabled\" are the first to resp6nd to-these pressures. And since criminality is essentially zmatter of social immaturity, the immediate result is an increase in crime. It is also notable that the number of juvenile criminals has increased. In speaking of this rise in crimes of violence amoflg juveniles, Reinhardt points out that ,,where last aPpears as a factor, it seems to have entered as a subordinate component to the dominating lust for the thtill of a cruel mu_tder\".f The Leopold and Loeb case is an obvious example, and Reinhardt cites many more. The problern is a complicated one, and must be considered in parts. - *These figures are quoted ftom the Encyclopedia Britannha yearbook for ry56.

And it should be recognized that this breakdow-n is largely a cotltural breaAdown. A soiiety,s culture is e kind of counterweight to its social pressures.

Ve five ia aa industial civilization with a basically mater[fistic culture..It ggut be obiected that our culture - with its roots in Newton, Marx, and Freud - is trardly closely connected with the rising rate of sex crime a:rd perversion. This is untrue. Improvel social conditions allow more freedom than ever before to the play of human intelligence. Any man or \\rroman of reasonable intelligence can obtain an education. Naturally, the man with xt active intelligence feels more interest in the contemporary \"monuments\" than in older \"monuments of unageing in_ tellect\". And the number of contemporaty..monumeirts,iwho , influence most of these prehensive intelligences is very small indeed.

If one of the major problems"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"2IO ORIGINS OF T}IE SEXUAL IMPULSE The simple view of crime, fashionable at the beginning of the century, was that it is 4n outcome of poverty; improve social conditions, improve education, and crime will disappear. Undoubtedly this is partially ttue, as can be seen from the case of Ktirten. But improvement of social condiqions is by no mearrs the whole solution, if the irnprovement is accompanied by increased industtializatton, and its various ptessures that make for the \"insignificance\" of the individual. !7hile social improvement may cause a decrease in crimes involving lar- c€rrlr it may have the opposite effect on sex crime. In eight- eenth-century England, when poverry was widespread, the modern sex crime was almost unknown, as can be seen from the Newgate Cahndar or Pelham's Cbroniclu of Crine. Vidocq, the first chief of the Paris Sfiret6, mentions in his Memoirs hundreds of cases of murder and tobbefy that he solved, but not (as fat as I can recall) a single sex ctime. And it might be pointed out that the notorious degenerates of history - Tiberi- us, Gilles de Rais, De Sade * were the over-privileged rather than the underprivileged. Most of the recorded sex crimes of the eighteenth century'qrere rapes and abductions committed by noblemen. In our os/n time the typical psychopathie cdme is often the \"crime of boredom\", the crime that appears to have no particular motive, but, to spdng out of \"too much freedom\" and total lack of a sense of purpose. InCrirue and tbe Sexual Fycltopatlt de River suggests that \"we should have laws to pfevent the spread of various hereditary tainted diseases\". Sex ctiminals are often found to have des- cended from a line of alcoholics, epileptics, etc. A family history of insanity ot congenital feeble-mindedness is not unusual. Professor Julian Huxley has receotly suggested that society will soon have to come to terms with the idea of selective bteeding to produce a higher level of administators. De Rivet's idea might be taken as a natural corollary of this suggestion; if \"desitabie\" unions are to be encoutaged, then obviously undesirable ones should also be discouraged. In the meantime it is obvious that mofe time and attention must be devoted to the study of the ctiminal mentality. Case SADISM AND TIIE CRIMINAL MBNTALITY 2II studies like the one Berg made on Kiirten are far too rare. It i m:ay also be that the old principles of Freudian analysis ob- , ,tro.t a fuller knowledge of the world of the criminal, and that ' .o*\" revision of priniiples may be necessary.

Under the circumstances it is not surprising that most of America's homosexuals prefer to congregate in the large cities - New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles - where the sense of belonging to a group helps to relieve sorne of the social strain. Reinhardt cites sevetal cases of sexual offences whcre the sentence seems to be out of all proportion to the crime. There is, fot example, the case of Glefl, who went to a dance hall in the hope of picking up a girl who would be willing to permit him sexual satisfaction; he soon found a girl whose manner suggested that she might. After an evening sPent in drinking and dancing, during which time his excitement mounted, the girl announced that she would allow him no sexual liberties, and that she intended to walk home alone. He followed her, choked her into submission, and raped her. For this offence he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. This was his first sexual ofience, although he had been sentenced to a refotma- tory twenty years eadier for burglary. Under the circum- stances the sentence seems batbarous. The prosecutingattot- ney described Glen as a \"vicious man who . . . would not heiitate to commit the crime agailr,', while the prison admini- sttators, on the cootrary, describe him as \"amenable to d'iscip- line, intelligent, co-operative, and trustworthy'1 and of *In a tecent case in Plymouth (England), a Church of England cletgy- man trras restored to his place in the church aftet serving a prison sentence for a sexual assault ofl a young boy.

Another case where excessive moral indignation seems to have led to a savage seotence is that of a forfy-two-year-91$ man serving \" ..rrt\"nce cif twenty yeafs for incest with his fifteen-year-ota daughter. The arresting sheriff describes the case as ?'o.r\" of the vr'orst on record\". Luke, the offender, was described by the prison psychologist as o'slightly antagoniltig\", but othrirwise laiking in \"abnotmal personality tfaits\". Rein- hardt rcmarks that Luke seems to regard the whole business as an unjustified ,interference with his personal _afiairs. From the detaiis he then offers, it would apPear that Luke is partly in the right. He was oa bad terms with his vrife, who had tefused him sixual satisfaction for a long period. They had six chil- dren, and were exttemely Poor; Luke remarked: \"We didn't go nowhere hardly at all;'we were too poot and had too many kids.\" He was awafe that his two elder daughters \\xrefe leading \"fast sexual lives\"; the fifteen-year-old worked in a cheap eating place as a waitress and Plostituted herself to the custo- *.rr'f6, money; the eldest daughter worked in a factory and also had murty iorr\"*. Luke decided to approach his daughters sexually; they were willing, and intercoufse with them took place fiequently. The mother suspected, and reported it to the police, who extorted confedsions from the daughtels-bY threats Lf a reformatory (for their general promiscuity). The upshot was Luke's twenty-year-sentence. It could be argued here that the only real offence was having intercours\" -ith a minor. He could not be accused of impair- ing morals that were alteady past fecovefy. (In Cotnwall, England, where this kind of offence is very frequent, the sen- t\"nl\" would probably have been from three months to five years in jail; possibly it might have amounted only t9 probl iion.) Undei the circumstances, Luke's attitude of \"slight antagonism\" seems iustified, and'his comments can hardly be iudged as revealing incorrigible moral obliquity: \"I can',t see'whit business it was of anyone else's - we wefen't hurting"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"214 i ORIGINS OF TIIE SEXUAL IMPULSE nobody. . . . I ain't done no worse than lots of other people, and I don't know why people had to make so much of it.\" He declared his belief that incest was commofl, only \"others is smart enough not to get caught\". Reinhardt remarks that the other prisoners treat him with contemptuous tolerance (rppr- rently the normal attitude of prisoners to sexual offenders), and that he is accorded only \"minimum social acceptance\" by his fellow prisoners. His prison record was good. (H. had no ptevious convictions.) The prison chaplain noted,his indiffer- ence to religion, and Luke himseif commented that, while he is willing to do whatever is expected of him tniail, he does not \"want aflyone preaching to him about what he should do or what he shouldn't have done\". Reinhardt mentions rwo other cases of incest in which the sentence might seem excessive (in one case tw.enty, in the other, thirty years), although the daughtet involved in each case was only eight years old. In one case - the man'who re- ceived thirty years - intercourse had been taking place, with the daughter's willing consent, from the age of eight to the age of fifteen (when she discovered herself to be pregnant). In the othet case the man seduced two of his daughters when his wife refused to have intercourse with him, but after his arrest (following his wife's denunciation), his wife pleaded for his release, while the daughters v/rote letters asking for the return of their \"dear Daddy\". Obviously his wife had not expected the sentence to be so savage. This leads to the supposition that, if she had realized the results of her denunciation, she would not have gore to the police, and her husband would have escaped all punishrnent. It follows that these excessive punishments may iometimes defeat their own end. The whole problem, then, is complicated (in America more than in Europe) by the attitude of the legal authorities to sex crime, and by a cefiain amount of moral cant. Frederic !7er- tham has devoted a powerful and convincing littte book, Tbe Sbow of Violence, to pleading that it is more important to study crime than to punish it. The problem, of course, is not as simple as that. There are not enough psychiatric ctnics or SADISM AND THE CRIMINAL MENTALITY enough qualified psychologists to carry out a useful and con- certed programme of criminological study. Nevertheless, like the similar problem of lack of schools and qualified teachers, this could be overcome as soon as its necessiry had been cleady recognized. To summatize: the tise in sex crime is one of the great problems of our time. It is a result of the pressures that are inevitable in an industralized society; it is characteristic, more- over, of a time of intellectual and moral nihilism. On the intellectual and social level, \"society\" can do nothing about it, for the intellectual and moral wellbeing of sociery has always been in the hands of a relatively small number of highty talented and responsible individuals - its originators of new thought and new directions. But on the social level a gteat deal ian be done about it, solely by treating the problem as immedi- ate and urgent, and recogntztngthe need for afar. deepsr study of the subject.

He pointed out that there have been rwo major schools of psychological thought, which he calls the Apollon- il ; i3r and Dionysian (i'orro*irre;'f.;* Nietzsche) - that is to say, the mechanistic and the vitari-st. In modem times the mecharr- istic current star-ts with Descaftes, continues through spinoza, Locke, Hume, Hartley, the Mills, Spencer, and f,ain, down i, rr4ruv),, Lur, lvrltlD, opctlutrf, auq' -Daln, oown r to Russell's Behaviourism.

Although Freud, Jung, Adler, and Rank would be auto- , matically included in this second group, it can be seen that they tepresent a minority , for. a dozen oth.r i*port ot narnes could r be added, none o{ j!\"T in $e psychoanalytical movement (for , example, those of Koffka, $Tertheimer, and Kohler, the foun- ders of Gestalt theory). The modern educated man tends to ;'r identify psychology with Freud and his followers; in fact, ;; Freud owes his pre-eminence to the spectacular neture of his ;'r achievement. lTilliam Rowan Hamilton d.isJovered that a i completely consistert mathematics can be constructed upoa 1, theories- and the attendant publicity; he has gained cred_it for I \"it rr.1rng\" a g-reat deal that is actually the cJmmon properry I lf mqd^ern psychologl.

Freud was as statling an originator as ii, *ir*lle; unfortunately, his work musr beiifted as clrefully as i, Atistotle's for truth and error. He was, after all,a doctor, con- . cerned with the \"epidemic\" of neurosis brought about by the I ,l*\"p: social.changes of the early twentieth .irrtory.

Strangely enough, where science is concerned, the foundation does not matterl what riatters is the structure reared on it. For science is unlike a building in that its foundations can be altered at a latet date without causing any damase to the building. Mathematicians will explain about the use of imaginary numbers (lik6 1[s square toot of minus one) that can be introduced into a mathematical structure - like invisible bricks - and made to support it until it is time for them to be removedl when the imagrnary'nbricks\" are removed, the structure is unaltered; it certainly does not collapse. What Freud failed to rualize is that if a patient is suffering from neurosis, almost any intelligent analysis, under any theory, will solve his problems. Often, the patient only needs a \"psychological boost\" to enable him to make a new effort of pre- hension, and to solve his own problerns. Neurosis might be like- aed to debts that have been allowed to pile up; too many of them resultinthe bankruptcy ofinsanity. The patient then slips into a passive attitude towards these \"debts\". The life energy fails; \"discouragement\" sets in. Then almost anything can happen. Like most eady psychologists, Freud failed to recognize the importance of \"intentionality\", of the immense r6le played by the will-power of the patienr. He looked for mechanical causes for the effects, underestimating the freedom and power of human intentionality. It has taken fifry years of Gestalt psy-. chology and phenomenology to reveal io* of the truth \"bo,rt the mind's ability to turn its preconceptions into realities. Freud immediately grasped the negative side of this ability: for example, the patient's powef to induce illness to escape some onerous responsibility. But he views the person's neu- rosis against the background of some'osocial norm\" or ideal of perfect \"adjustment\" to lifle or society. It never seemed to sttike him that, since there is no upward limit to evolution, there can be no final adjustment - although a creative person might discover an unusual degree of health and balance in a flow of creative energy. This cutious piece of blindness on Freud's part led him to undertake preposterous psvcho- analytical study of vatious men of genius - Leonatdo and Dostoevsky, for example - always with the idea of \"cutting 'them down to size\", of iconoclasm (Freud's habit of icono- i clasm, like Shaw's, became ingrained and a little tiresome). , This was the triumph of abstraction over commor seflse. One of the eadiest ctiticisms of psychoanalysis illusttates this humoudess and abstract approach: writers on the subject would ask how it is possible to be sure that the psychoanalyst woulct ask ho\\r lt ls PosslDle to De sure tnat me Psycnoanalyst himself is perfectly \"normal\". It never seemed to strike these critics (a) that a one-eyed oculist ot one-legged doctor may be , neurotic patient to the analyst is fat mote'actiue than the rela- tion of a doctor to L tuberculosis patient. There vras an undet- l: lyi\"g assumption that a psychoanalyst ought to be somehow infallible, iust as a priest ought to be, on the whole, free of mortal sin. Already Freud was assuming the status of a Pope; his disciples were priests, carrying the infallible word. All this is inherent in the criticism. These various cricisms were fitst developed by Adler and i Jung. They felt that Freud's outlook was fat too ('intellectual\", with a na\\ve, nineteenth-century faith in the power of reason I and expedmental method. Adler declated that Freud's insist- ence on tracing back the patient's sexual history \\firas only an- other opportunity for the patient to escape the realiry of his present problems; he insisted that the iob of the psychologist I is to give the patient a kind of \"meirtal charge\" so that he i makes a new attempt to overcome his problems and his desire : to escape. Adlet's view pays more resPect to the freedom of i the individual than Fteud's - and at the same time, to the I hidden forces of intentionality that could allow the patient to i,i cure himself. ir , Adler then made an immense steP in the direction of an existential psychology. He declated that man is dtiven onwards by his senqe of inferiority (the same inferiority that led the eadiest men to develop weaPons and form society) towards some state of final perfection, \"as by a blind teleology\".

Adler's docttine of the inferioriry complex has become as famous as Freud's libido; in fact, it is frequently atftibuted to Freud. - Jyg_r break with Freud started when he published his book rransfornations and slnbob of Libido in-tgrz.In this work, Jorg showed that his mind was of a different quality from Freud's. He could aot be content with the atmoipherl of the co_ns^ultig-room and the case-record; he was equafly interested in literature, history, and mythology. Freudis mother fixation has to be given new depth by relating it to the Earth Mother, Kali, and so on. In hii later work it became lpp.arenq that Jung was less a psychologist than an anthropo- logist with a deep religior.rs impulse. For Freud and Freudians, these new emphases,s/ere only a depature from scientific rigour, an admisiion of weakness.* on the whole, their attitudJ was wise. Intuition is important, but it has no value for the \"analyical\" scientist unless it can be supported arralyically. This kind of support was deveroped slowly and painfully by KofFka, Werthelmer, and Hussed. The third important revolt from Freudian method was made by otto Rank. First of all Rank developed Adlet's idea that therapy should be a \"conscious', atrak, not a gtoping around with dubious dream symbols and childhood irra\"- ences. Rank anticipated the discoveries of modern anthropo- logy and zoology in declaring that sex is not the basic aniiral drive, nor was it the basic ddve in our distant ancestors. Rank later developed a thepty of unconscious will that is close to Hussed's later views. Ira Progoffsummarizes the net result of the \"revolution\": \". . . the emergence of a new kind of psy- *For-9xa1nle, the late Ernest Jones, Fteud,s biogmpher, borrowed my copy of rra Progoff's Deatb and Rebirtb of Pslcbologl, He returned it to mL with a letter admitting that it is, on the whole, fait and accurate. But his annotations reveal that he is-completely umecbnciled to the new approach. Fot example, where Progoffhas wtitten: \"Freud's most obvious wiakness lies in the detetminism that undetlies his work,,, Jones has undetlined \"weakness\" and written in the matgin '.Strength,,.- 223 chology that no longer seeks to diagnose modern man and reduce him to 'normaliry'. It attempts instead rio provide a mbans by which the modern person can experience the larger meanings of life and patticipate in them with all his faculties.\" This revolution \"reaffirms man's e4perience of himself as a spiritual being\". While it is impossible to deny the immense value of the later work of Jung and Rank, the old objection remains open: it is too unscientific, too much a tnatter. of intuitions and inspired guesses. It is important that the gap between scientific method and q'poetic insights\" should not be ovedooked. Mary Baker Eddy's ideas about the relation of the \"power of mind\" to the human body may well prove to have a basis in faa; they aI- ready anticipate the later development of the theory of intentionaliry. But they cannot be regarded as scientific until Gestalt theory and phenomenology have been taken to a point whete controlled experiments can show them to have some foundation. Even when (and if) this happens, however, Mrs. Eddy's Science and Health will still be nothing rnore than sloppily written and badly constructed rambling. Jrtg saw, rightly, that the development of such a con- sciousness would involve nothing less than the re-creation of the \"religious apptoach\" to Me. The priest, for example, feels that he, as well as his penitent, is involved in the universal ptoblem of original sin; yet his attirude is not therefore pessi- mistic. But Jung turned too easily to the old \"religious truths\", and to re-interpreting them in the modern rnanfler; this might have been vety useful in its way, but it did not advance the science of psychology. At this point, there sprang up ir various parts of Europe the school that has since been labelled \"Existential psychology\", end which is considered by many to be the most revolutionary advance in psycho-therapy since the days of ITilliam James. According to Rollo Mry, the school sprang up \"spontan- eously\" - that is, no single thinker was tesponsible for its basic ideas - unless, perhaps, we take the view that Kiedcegaard or Nietzsche was its real founder.

The whole method of this present book has been phenomeno- logical - that is to salr has tried to confine itself to a steady contemplation of \"the facts\" about sex, without theoretical preconceptions like \"conscious and unconscious\", the death wish, r\"ie-cont.iousness, etc. Herbert Spiegelberg, in his brilliant and comprehensive book The Pbenonenological Moae- nent (Ivlartinus Niihotr, The Hague, 196r), says: \"Pheno- menology is the systematic exploration of phenomena not only - in the sens€ of what appears . . . but also of the wal in which things apper .. .\" and again, even more simply, defines phenomenology as \"the ways of given-ness\". Agrit, he speaks of the aim of phenomenology as \"to detach the phenomena of our everyday expetience ftom the context of out naive ot natural living, while preserving theit content as fully as possible\". Spiegelberg devotes an interesting section to an attempt at a phenomenological descdption of the idea of \"force\". He points out that the aim of phenomenological description is to convey a certain sensation to a petson who has never felt it. (Example: try to desctibe to someone what it feels like to get an electric shock, and how it differs from plunging into cold water on a hot day; if you can do this con- vincingly, you are a good phenomenologist!) And the most interesting point that emerges from Spiegelbetg's account is that such an attempt naket for increased precision of language; it helps to desttoy linguistic vagueness. It serves the function that Eliot claimed was the aim of poetry: \"to purrfT the dialect of the tribe\". EXTSTENTTAL PSYCHOLOGY zzt Now it will be seen immediately that such a method is a tevoluti,on in psycho+herapy. Because all psychology so far l, has begun with a set of preconceptiorc, andhas made its solutioa dependent on making the \"facts\" fit in. Consequently its effect . on language and precision has been poisoflous. It has intro- duced lots of new words and terms, thereby greatly confusing the issues; but it has done little to explore and clarify our simple concepts. , This is a point of considerable importance, and perhaps I , might be forgiven for dwelling on it. The difierence berween I the old approach and the pheno,menological approach might i b\" made clearer by a comparison with literature. !7hen you i read a gteat novelist of the nineteenth century - Dickens or Dostoevsky, for example - your wodd may be trantfornedby \\ it.

Existential psychology is a response to the need for a less materialistic vision.

Edmund $Tilson once remarked: \"The aflswer to Mr. Eliot's assertion that .it is doubtful whether civillzaion can endure without religion, is that we have got to make it endure\". Arid this is a-iso the ansv/er to the assertion tlrat the \"angst\" of modern man can only find its cure in religion.

In psycho-analysis the analyst is assumed to be somehow \"outside\" his patients'problems.In existential psychology the analyst knowJperfectty well that he himserf is involved in the same riddle that is imposing strain on his patient. He can help the patient to help to sort out ..inessen- tial\" neuroses from the basic \"angst\", and, depending upofl his own inner resources, powers, and insights, mighl even suggest a more fruitful approach to the basic problems. But the relation is differeflt; they are like two soldiers on a match, the stronger helping the weaker. But both are in enemy terri- tory, and a stray bullet might kill either of them at any moment. An example cited by Rollo May demonstrates rhe existentiar method. Jhe patientwas anintelligent womanof twenty eight, who had fits of uncontrollable rage, acute anxietiis, ind various other minor symptoms. She \\ilras an illegitimate child, who had been made to feel unwanted; her mother had evefl told her that she had tried to abort her. One day, after some months of treatment in wlrich the analyst attempted to deepen her awareness of her relation to existence, she had an experience that might have come from James's Varieties of Religiotts Experience: '\"I remember walking that day under the elevated tracks in a slum area, feeling the thought:'I amanillegitimatechild,. f recall the sweat pouring forth in my anguish in trying to accept the fact. fh\"n I inderstood wlat it must feel-liki to accept: 'I am a Negro in the midst of privileged whites' or ,I am blind in the midst of people who see'. Latet on that d^y,I woke up and it came to me in this way: 'I accept the fact that I amarlillegitimate child'. But,'Iam not a child any more'. So it is, 'I am illegitimate'. Then what is left? ![hat is left is this: 'I arfl.' This act of contact and acceptance with 'I am', once gotten hold of me, gave me (what I think was for me the first time) the experience: 'Since I am,I have the right to be'.* *Existence, p.4r. EXTSIENTIAT PSYCHOLOGY z2g Vhat has happeoed here is the dawning of enawarencssinan erca for which, so far, we have no terminology. 'S7e can per- haps say vaguely that the patient had lost her basic self-respect, her sense of the necessity of her existence, and that the neu- roses that developed rilrere rather like the noise made by the engine of a car when it is disengaged from the gears and then rewed. The loss of contact with reality leads to a kind of hysteria. The discussions with the psychologist evidently restored the patient's sense of self-respect, her ability to take herself seriously. (She had received littlb conventional sch6d- ing, but was highly intelligent and had educated hetself; this reveals a basic sense of puqpose, with which she was agun placed in contact by the analysis.) Plainly this is simple \"outsider-psychology\". 'V7hen the talented person feels that his (or het) powers are being wasted, neurosis is inevitable. The more talented the person, the more powerful the need for \"friction with reality\". A cow can graze quietly in a field all its life without becoming neurotic; it needs very little friction. Shaw expressed his sense of dislike of the Dublin society described in U$ssesi \". . . the life that Dublin offers to its young meo. lrJo doubt it is much like the life of young men everywhere in modern urban civihzauon. A certain flippant futile derision and be- littlement that confuses the noble and serious with the base and ludicrous. . . . When I left my native city I left that phase behind me, and associated no more with men of my age until . . . I was drawn into the Socialist revival of the eady eighties, among Englishmen intensely serious, and burning with in- dignation at the very real and fuodamental evils that affected all the world.\" (Preface to Imnaturity.) Shaw might easily have developed a neurosis like the oae cited above if he had been anifrcially confined to Dublin sbciety, and denied access to the \"serious men\" in London. But in the case of the young woman, the task of the therapist was simplified by her intelligence, and by her previous train- ing in s'elf-education. Long discussions with any serious and intelligent persoo could have affected the cure. ..

Neurosis is assumed to be the sign of ..the engine rewing in a void\", out of touch with the gears. It can now be seen, perhaps, why the movement decided to ally itself with existentialism in the form created by Kierke- gaatd and Heidegger. For existentialism attempted to develop a terrpinology that would distinguish \"degrees of existeoce'!. 'It is true that certain existential psychologists have taken over Heidegger's obscurities and dark metaphysical incantations a little too enthusiastically,* without rcalizingthe shallow flature of some of his genenlizations. But on the whole, the language is made an instrument of the psychological insight, and is n6t allowed to become its tyrant. It is also true that the existential interpretations sound occa- sionally as far-fetched as anything in Jung or Freud. Medard Boss, for example, cites a case of a patient who suffered from handwashiag and cleaning compulsions. He had dreams of church steeples which had been interpreted by Freudian ar.a- lysts as phallic symbols, and by a Jungian analyst as a religious archetype symbol. One day this patient had a dreamin which he entered a locked lavatory, plunged waist-deep in ordure, and tried to pull himself out by a bell rope lea&ng up to a *It should be mentioned, for those\\nacquainted with the existential movement, that fot some years now Heidegger's position has been held to be extremely dubious. cetain aspects of hiv achievement are uri- assailable.

This is specially ttue of Heidegger. Although his beadng is as ponderous and objcore as $a1-of any try\" philosophet, the teader feels occasionalry that one of Heidegger's fundamental pteoccupations is to .nput himselfacross,, as a ptofound thinker. Professor Kaufmann's brilliant attacks on him ,are $gltty unfair; aftel ill, it is hardly to the point that Heidegger became a Nazi supporter and disowned his old teacher Husseil (who was Jewish), and then, aftet the war, took care to disclaim all enthusiasm-for thi Nazis. But Kaufmann's observation of the tbeatrical nature of much of flgrdgqgefs_thinking is devastatin gly arcrrate. Heidegget's showmanship is iosidious because, unlike Sartre's, it is carefully coniealed. 23r church steeple. Boss interpreted all this as meaning that the patient had locked up certain vital potentialities within him- .self and was unconsciously refusing to develop himself; this caused guilt feelings. He failed to face and alsotb the rwo opposed aspects of himself: the spiritual and the lower physi- cal. The analysis was brought to a successful conclusion after the patient had a psychotic relapse due to the dtearn. Boss may be right in his analysis; without a personal ac- quaintance with the patient it is impossible to say. But on the surface, the talk about \"locking up spiritual and physical potentialities\" sounds as unlikely as the Freudian inteqpreta- tioa of phallic symbols or the Jungian idea of religious arche- tyPes. Nevertheless it must be admitted that existential psychology brings a new approach to such problems as the wodd of the compulsive. Von Gebsattel quotes a cese in which a seventeen- year-old boy was governed wholly by compulsive behaviour. The boy seemed to live offthe edge of his nerves. He would sit on the lavatory for hours waiting for his penis ro stop dripping because he believed that the least drop of urine would make him smell offensivelyi he would urrap the end of his sexual member in toilet paper, and even this would seem ine{fectual. He could not continue reading, if he decided to do so, because he would find himself stadng at every word separately. All his movements, from getting up in the morning, were rigorously ordeted, and he found himself observing himself in the tiniest action. He had an obsession about diit, and would not go through a door without carefully avoiding the door supports in case he dirtied his clothes. He was able to read occasionally if he accidentally came upon something readable, but not otherwise. The case sounds bizatte to the layman; but lt is not unlike the \"case\" described by Sartre in l-a NalsCe, Roquentia also analyses erperiences down to such miaute patticulars that they lose meaning.

E)ilSTENTIAL PSYCHOLOGY 233 In Federico Fellini's remarkable film La Dolce Vita tberc is an episode that bears all the signs of being a tflre case history.* The hero of the film is the young iournalist Marcello - honest, but unsure of himself, caught in the corruption of Roman society life and inclined to drift. His friend Steiner seems at 6rst to be one of the fiIm's few symbols of meaningful living. Kind, setious, a scholar, he is not unlike sorne of Aldous Huxley's symbols of warmth and humanity in the later novels - Propter in Alter M*y a Sammer, for example. He is happily married, with two young children, a beautiful wife, brilliant friends, and an apparently ideal home life. One night Marcello attends a pafiy at Steiner's home; when. the friends stand alone in the bedroom of the children, Steiner expresses his basic ' fea4 the Kierkegaardian angtt: \"Aoy life, even the most miserable, is worth more than a sheltered existence in a wodd where everything is organized, where everything is practical, everything has its place. . . . Sometimes the night, this darkness, this calm, weighs on me. It is peace that makes me afraid. Perhaps only because I dis- trust it above everything. I feel that it's only an appeut nce, that it hides a danger. Sometimes, too, I think of the wodd my children will know. They say that the world of the future will be wonderful. But what does that mean? It needs only the gesture of a madman to destroy everything.\" And later in the fi\"lm Steiner murders his two children and then shoots himself. Marcello's last symbol of strength and decency has crumbled. A Freudian, evefl a Jungian, would be baffied by such a case, and would spend time investigating Steiner's past for guilt feelings and complexes. These might, of course, exist, and contribute to the breakdown. But the basic causes qf the break- down can only be gmsped through existentialpsychology. The characteristic of Kierkegaard's \"anguish\" is that it is not an- xiety abo# some specific thteat; it need not even be a general anxiety about the cruelty of life, like Ivan Karamazov's; it is a *The film scnpt - by Fellini - has been published in the United States by Ballantyne Books."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"214 ORIGITSS Of TI{E Sru(UAL II\\dPt LSE recognition that man is a sleepwalker, preoccupied by his little problems, and that he is actually walking with complete un- awareness along the narrow top of a wall a thousand feet high. When Sartre speaks of \"the basic horror of existence\", he is being uturecessarily melodramatic. There is certainly immense danger, but that is a different thing. Man is alone in a universe of which he knows nothing except his own corner. As a child, he accepted the benevolence of the adult wodd; as an adult, he tends to accept the benevolence of the universe at large; but there ere moments, confronting death orpairi, when this seems to have been a comfortable illusion. Every morning the news- paper brings new evidence of man's cruelty and indifference to the suffedng of others, murder of children, and torture of animals; and there are times when nature seems a malignant force taking pleasure in natural disasters. A man who became sensitive to all this would then be in a position to appreciate the finer \"metaphysical evil\" of the universe: the ravages of time, man's ultimate death and the illusions that keep him from being awate of it, the possibility that life is a trap, that man is a victim being fattened by a butchet. Are these ultithate horrors? Is there no escape from them? This question cannot be answered, for we have not yet made a start on the real problems. Thete are times when life burns io us with such certainty that the unknown landscape seems to be revealed by a lightning flash, and we become convinced that whethet or not we cafl know the answer, \"Life\" knows per- fectly well where/it is leading us; if we could deepen our understanding and conscious grasp by immease effort, we might outselves be slightly'more capable of grasping the purpose. But since our everyday life is a stumbling match, with blinkers oo our eyes, it is impossible to know whether the vision of horror or the vision of meaning is \"deeper\". But it is important not to confuse \"angst\" with human weakness, and to assume that every fool who blows out his brains has been involved in a wrestling match between Ulti- mate Yes and Ultimate No. Most neurosis is a result of human iatentioaality. As children, we think of \"punishing\" our EXISTENTTAL PSYCHOLOGY 2rt parents, if they make life too difficult for us, by becoming ill or feigning weakness; the habit is ingrained, and in adulthood we may want to \"punish\" life for not treating us with the corsideration we deserve. It is a conscious - or almost con- scious - decision: \"No, I won't go on under these conditionsl if Destiny wants me to go on, it had better make me a better offer. Otherwise'I'll lie down and kick\", This childish element can be present in the strongest of human beings, to be evoked by some particulady difficult circumstances. Now although existential psychology can do nothing about , the real \"angst\" - which must always remain unless man carl tura himself into a god-it can, to some extent, deal withthis weakness. And it is important to (ealize that the weakness acts as an amplifier of the \"metaphysical angst\". There is no earthly reason why an intelligent man, with a fairly firm grasp on \"reality\", should decide to kill himself because of the ' \"horror of life\". To begin with, he may only be jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire. When man is \"balanced\" - when the centres are working reasonably - he can athieve a balance between his perception of \"dangef'and his knowledge of the potential strength of human beings. These considerations should make it apparent that \"Steiner\" might have been helped by an unusually authoritative existen- tial psychologist, but would have little to hope for from any of the Freudian schools. It is of interest that Steiner remarks that \"Ary life, even the most miserable, is worth more than a sheltered existence in a world where everything is organtzed\". To begin with, the remark betrays immaturity; a few months undet really difficult conditions would soon make him grateful for what he has. This ptoblem must be further consideted in a moment. But . the seiond half of his remark - about otgatization - reflects a cuffent of thought that is of some importance in modern \\il7estern culture, a tendency to anti-rationalism.

This occurs when, out of anfloyance at having our experience so heavily taxed, we fall into complete apathy, and refuse to cheer up for any pleasure. fn Six Cltaracters Pitandello remarked that unhappiness drives us to ask ques- tions, while ure accept happiness as our dght. Since it is in the interest of evolution that we should be kept asking questions, it is undetstandable that some biological mechanism should try to prevent us from becoming too happy. Nevertheless, by a difficult process of compensation it z.r possible to defeat the repeating mechanism occasionally, and to benefit from a flew' intensity of experience. (The easier methods of defeating the mechanism - drugs, alcohol, etc. - are self-defeating, since the mechanism increases its strength to combat them - as resist- aflce to a disease increases as its germs are absorbed - and only makes it mote difHcult for the drug-taker when the effects have worn otr ) If human beings could develop a tendency to ques- tion their happiness as vigorously as their unhappiness, no doubt the tepeating rnechanism would be discarded as bio- logically unnecessary. But already it is becoming apparent that the problem of sex crime - and of sexual perversion - is one of the characteristic problems of our time. It would not be too inaccurate to say that we live in a schizophrenic society. The chief problem in Freud's d^y - the eady twentieth century - was hysteria, the patient's first reaction to the increasing difficulties and com- plexities of existence. An attempt at adjustmeflt is made, but an inadequate attempt that adjusts only the surface of the being. The result is thd split between \"rnature\" surface and adoles- cent depths. Schizophrenia might be considered as a slightly \"maturer\" ailment than hysteria; the shift from hysteria to schizophrenia indicates that society has made some slight pro- gress in adjustment to the new conditions. The rise in sex crime and sexual pervetsion tequires a ne\\v examination of the origins of the sexual impulse. In Caste and Clax in a Soutberu Town, John Dollard observes: 'oSexual per- 239 versions are said to be less frequent among Negroes, masturba- tion raret, and smeadngs and self-mutilations less common than among white patients. The reason alleged is that the direct genital expression of Negro sexuality is less prohibited, and the inner pressures which might dtive Negroes to sub- stitutive forms of sexual gratificaion do not exist.\" He also observes that the white maa tends to effry the Negro his sexual freedom.* But Dollatd's book was first published n ry37.It would be interesting to discovet the statistics of today, a quafter of a century latet A superficial glance at the Trilc Detcctiae magazines of the r95o's reveals a steep increase in the number of Negroes involved in sexual crimes - particulady against white \\romen; it seems probable that sexual perversion would also show an increase. An existential examination of the sexual impulse teveals that the inability of the older psychology to deal with the problem of sexual perversion sprang from its assumption that there is a basic energy called the libido, and that the impulses of the Iibido are the deepest known to psychology. This conclusioa was buttressed by the findings of Darwinian biologists, who declared that sex is the driving impulse in animal sociery. Since then, zoology has modified its conclusions, and it is becoming widely r.ecognized that the will to ptecedence and the need for territory are even mofe \"basic\" than the sexual drive. *\"The othet said that a Negro man always has about ten women beside his wife on the string - one nevet satisfies him.\" (Op. eit., p. ,98.) Dollard's analysis makes it clear that in some respects Negto society comes close to Blake's idea of complete sexual freedom. A Negto school teacher tematked that most of her gids had had sexual experience at an ez,lJy age.

Is it possible, then, to move from the consideration of sexual abnormalify to any mofe general statements about o'mafl\" of \"the narure of human intelligence\"? Mautice Mer- leau-Ponty, the French phenomenologist and follower of Husserl, considered the problem in his book Tbe Pbenouenologt of Perceptioa. Metleau-Ponty was mainly concerned to attack iertain \"materialistic psychologies\", particularly behaviour- ism (to which he devoted most of his eadier book, The Structurc of Behaaiour, published in ry42)- On a severely scientific ievel, he attempts to undermine 'S7'atsonian be- haviourism and Pavlov's \"reflexology\", and ptoves that only a Gestalt theory can fully account for human behaviour and responses. Medeau-Ponry's interest, in the Present context, liei in his use of sexual penrersions to tefute \"mechanistic physiology\". The present book has ignored total materialism as a possible solution of the origins of the sexual impulse, since it cannot even begin to exPlain sexual perversion. The leadet of the behaviourist school, J. B. Watson, once wrote that no be- haviourist had ever observed \"anything that he can call con- sciousness, seqsation, imagery, percePtiorl, ot will\". Since Watson was presumably conscious when he wrote these words, it is hard to see exactly what he meant; at all events, we may assume that no one nowadays would take seriously his assertion that man is wholly a machine. Nevertheless, the Freudian view implies that man zr a kind of machine in that his \"fuel\" is a power calied the libido, and that a man whose Iibido is healthy and unadulterated will be somehow a well- adjusted machine. The conclusion to be dtawn from a careful study of sexual pewersion is that the libido, as such, does not exist. - An analogy might make clear exacdy what I mean by this. To the Freudian, a \"sexually abnotmal\" petson is somehow \"wrongly orientated\". W'e might picture mafl's \"psyche\" as a large circle. In the centre of the circle - at the cenire of man's being - is a fire called the libido. At various distances from the centie of the circle are points labelled \"penretsions\". Fellatio and cunnilingus afe farily close to the centfe; further out lies homosexuality and fetichism; further out still lies sadism and somewhere near the circumference is sexualmurdet. \"Curing\" a pefvert would rrteafl persuading his sexual inclinations to move back towards that centre. Existential psychology reiects this pictute. If man's total \"psyche\" is again represented by a circle, then \"sexual nor- mality\" is not at the Lentre of the circle, but somewhere mid- way berween the centle and the circumfetence. Beyond \"normality\" - closer still to the circumfetence - lie various perversions. But the significance of this ne'w pictufe can be immediately seefl. In the Freudian picture a frralt has achieved a kind of stability once he has been pushed back to the centre of the circle (unless he goes on thtough it towards the other side). In the existentialist picture a \"pervert\" could be pushed back to \"aormaliry\" - but ie could tben go on tbroagh normality, belond sex, closer stitt n tbe centre. He could, in short, lose the sexual im- pulse altogether, ffid be even more \"norrnal\" than the most sexually normal person. An immediati difference from Freudian psychology be- comes appatent. In Freud, sex is a kind of Nirvana. Somerset Maugham's story Rain is the perfect Freudian parable.

He would have been better off if he had lcknow_le{ged that his religion was a cover-up for sexual desire. sublimation is a second best, a poor subsitute for the .real thing, the proper expressioa of the tibiao. The existential psychologist finds this view unnecessarily dogmatic. rmagine a potential Peter Kiirten who falls into thl hands of an expert existential psychologist. with careful re- conditioning, a re-channelling of the desires, stimulation of the intellect and sense of beauty, he might be weaned away from his sadism and turned into a normafman.

Ttis questioa takes us.beyond psychology and into the realm of philtsophy. To begin with, the study of sexual perversioi makei it apparent that man can be conditioned to respond sexually to almost anything. What he responds to is a ..Gestalt,,, a sei of relations, rather than a definite object. After reading about various cases oFfetichism, it is \"rry io imagine a marihaving an orgasm at the sight of a cube ot atdangle. sex is subjective-. By this I mean that there is no necessarylehtion betwpen the sexual energy and an object. rf you are hungry a meal will satisfy you. If you pick up a live coal, it will buin you. There is a teal relation between your stofiuch and food, between your hand and a coal we think of the relation betweea male and female sexual organs as being the same kind of thing. Ob- THE TIIEORY OF SYMBOLIC RESPONSE 24' sgrva{o1 of perversion disproves this; what happens is that the mind bestows a kind of approval on cerrairi objects or symbols, and \"permits\" an orgasm when these appearin con- junction. rn crine and the scxsal Pslchopatb, de-fiver cites a case of a fetichist who became uncontrollable if he saw btas and p1nti91in coniunction; ooe day when he was out driving with his wife he saw these objects on a line, and stopped tLe car down the block, telling his wife he wanted to r\"--li at a house they had passed. He then went into tl,e garden, placed the undergarmeflts on the ground in the position they would have have been on a woman's body, and was ..copulating, with them when he was arrested. Plainly, his instincts had b&towed so much \"approval\" on these symbols of woman that he was affected by them as a \"normal', man would be affected by the sight of a naked womar in the garden, to such an exteni that he evea went through the action of copulating with them. such :?r\"-r a1 thig dispose of the notion that sexual tesponse is any kind of a subject-object relation. It is a response to slmboh. - Bearing this in mind, then, let us attempt a ..phenomeno- logical study\" of man, attempting to consider only what we have been \"givefl\" (remembering the definition of phenomeno- logy as \"the study of the givea',).

And the stfange thing about man is that his whole inner wodd adiusts itself to the Jtimulus, reacting in any aumbet of ways that have come into being by some previous activity of the will. It is on this point that behaviourism must be attacked, for it is here, and only here, that it can be refuted scientifically. The behaviourist argues Man draws his energy from food - from the outsid\" wodd. He also draws his sense of purpose ftom the outside world. So what is to distinguish him ftom a kind of self-winding machine? To say that his responses are usually more \"complicated\" than the stimulus is only to say that he is a complicated machine. And yet quite beyond these physical considerations his basic motiveieems to be a will to increased complexity. How can v/e account for this in terms of mechanism? Any machine canbe complex.

This is why wi call the sexual parts our \"private?arts\". All depends upon the idea of violating strangeriess. For the most part this mechanism wod.s we[ enough. But unfortunately the \"inner-pu1pose\" failed to place enough checks and guards on the meihanism. when the intensity of sexual response depends on the alien-ness that has been invaded, it follows that men will try to intensify the response still further by going further afield in alien-ness. si\"r their enioyment of \"normal\" sex depends on the sense of violaling a taboo, it.follows that they wiri try to increase thqir satisfaction by including as maoy taboos ai possible in the sexual object. rn a simple form, this can be fouad ia Germaa TIIE THEORY OF SYMBOLIC RESPONSE 247 romanticism - in STagner and Mann, for example - in the preoccupation with incest. If, on the contrary, we 1ived in a civilization in which you were expected to have sexual inter- course with parents or siblings, the idea of sleeping with one,s mother or sister would be incredibly tedious (..but we see them all the timet\"), and the thought of \"violating,, an alien girl correspondingly exciting. AU sexual perversions, from mereadultery to necrophily, c^nbe seen as attempts to increase the alien-ness of the act by increasing the number of taboos involved. Sex can never, on any level, be..healthy, ot..nor- rnal\". It always depends on the violating of taboos - or, as Baudelaire would have said, on the sense of sin. If the \"evolu- tionary force\" was ever examined by a panel of biologists and psychologists, they would be justified in demanding why the propagation of the race was made dependent upon a sense of sin,.and in pointing out that this piece of incompetence has led to the downfall of many civilizations through sexual decadence. By a phenomenological observation of ourselves and our sexual responses, we can, then, a:rive at a theoty of ..symbolic resp-onse\", in which the symbol is invested with meaning by a kind of \"grace\" of the inner-purpose.

At this pgint speculation might run wildly afield for a moment and consider whether there is any true subiect- object response, or whether it is all symbolic. sThen you'feel sick, a certain psychological adjustment can defeat the sick- ness.

This is only to suggest that the theory of symboric response rila) possess a relevancy outside the field of sex and aesthetics. But how is it possible to investigate the natute of the relation between o'mirld\" and \"external reality,, when mind is the investigator, and the unknown relationship also intrudes into the investigation? It can be done, of couise, just as a{ry uo- known \"x\" c,,n be discovered if there is enough data'for a series of comparisons. Human beings have arways found it TrrE TrrEoRy oF SYMBOLTC RESPONSE z4g simpler to negate \"mind\" and search for objective laws of . nature. science likes neat-equations, where everything can be accounted for. And on the whole, it has been successful in constructing its equations, and ignoring the facts that refuse to fit in. And the idea of \"life\"-or \"pirpose\" is one of the elements that the science of the p^t t rro hundted years has preferred to leave out of its equatiohs. So in Darwinism we have a \"mechanical\" evolution, and in watson we have a mechani- cal.psychology, iust as Newton and Descartes provided us with a mechanical universe. sTatson, of course, did not mean to imply that consciousness does not exist; this would have been an absurdity. But he implied that consciousness is a passiue spctator of the universe, , -\"r. ,.o,itness,, of what goes on. Gestalt theory and phenomenology assert that, on the contrary, consciousness is always interfering. The mechanistic theories - from Newton to Fieud - asserithat something is happening \"out there,,, and,that all responses depend on what is out there. Responses bappen, and they are as i.piyri.d,, \"s throwing a mrt.hinto gonpowder. .

When we examine human thought from its earliest origins - in the Vedas or ancient myths - down to the nineteenth cen- tury, rilre notice that man always thinks of himself as a \"creature in an inferior position - like a boy in school under the eye of a schoolmaster, or a son under the eye of a despotic father. There have been maoy \"revolutiofls\" irl thought; but they have always been revolutions against other i.., - that is, against the other schoolboys in the class. Never against the teacher. For example, we think of religious rebels like Luther and Calvin as men who stood out for more freedom, who defied the authority of the Church. It is startling to examine these men more closely; and to find that, in all essentials, they were \"more conservative than the consenratives\", that Calvin had Sewetus burned for denying the Trinity, and that Luther's majot tenet was that every word of the Bible is literally true. 'They w'ere, in many ways, far mote reactionary and old fashioned than the Church they were attacking. Luther set Chdstianity back a thousand years.

For in their picture the universe is \"out- there\", waiting for man to investigate it. God does not actually interfere in its workings; all that is attended to by \"natural laws\". But God made these laws, and he set the machinery going in the first place. God \"wound up the clock\". And here is man, on earth, a tiny ant of a creature, peering at the univetse through a telescope, doing his best to understand why God made it the way it is. \"God is a mathematician\" said Newton. The important thing about this picturc is that nan is an ant. He can \"understnd\" nature by using his intelligence, but he is still avety tiny creature, and very unimportant. The greatest of all revolts - probably the greatest single tevolt in the history of human thought - was that change of attitude that occurred around the beginning of the nineteenth century: the change that was expressed by Dostoevsky and Nietzsche in the statement: \"All things are lawful\"; i.e. there is no God up ia the skn and man is his own iudge of right and \\rfong. What exactly does this mean? Remember that, according to the \"new science\", man is still taking himself for gtanted, iust as he did when the Church was at the height of its po\\rrer.

The \"thimble\" is the question: \"!7hat are the laws of the uni- vefse?\", and rnan continued to ruflrmage around the universe, lifting mountains, peering at stars, making endless calcula- tions, and still not finding his thimble. The Catholic Church declated: \"The thimble is hidden in St. Peter's pocket; you must accept his wotd for it\". Luther declared: \"No, the thim- ble is hidden in the Bible\". Newton came along and declared in the most demure way possible: \"You can forget St. Peter and the Bible\". (kr fact, Newton wrote a vast commentary on the Bible - but he did not look there for the \"secret of the uai- ygrsel'- only fot a few mihor details in God's chronology.) The t'secret\", for Newton, was out there, in the universe, and with enough science and mathematics, it could be discovered. Now the full - and most fascinating - implications of that statement: \"All things are lawful\" can be seen. It boils down to three statements, two of them correct, and one wtong. (a) S7e cannot discover the meaning of right and wrong by look- ing through a telescope; no amount of scrutiny will reveal God's Purpose inherent in Nature. (b) This is because there is no God \"out there\", who is in conttol of right and wrong. (c) But man is only a small, miserable creature, who also has no ultimate ideas on right and \\ilrrong. Therefore, all things are lavrful. This statement summarizes the intellectual position of romanticism for a hundred and fifty years. It is as true of Goethe's FarctandSchiller's Robbers as of the works of Camus and Sartre. Sartre has only added a pendant to (c), declaring that although man ir a miserable creature, he can at least dig- nify himself by recognizing that he has to choose right and wrong, that he cari add slightly to his stature by o'committing\" himself. It will now be seen what an extraordinary revolution has beea brought about by these two apparently academic and highly technical theories, phenomenology and Gestalt psy- chology. For what they have done is to substitute a quite different clause i\" (.). Th.y have suggested that man tries TTIE rrrEoRy oF syMBoLrc RsspoNsE 2t, looking in his own pocket for the thimble. The ground was -prepared for them of course, by Freud, with his insistence on the \"subconscious\". For although Freud'was oot the inventor of the idea of the uaconscious mind, he emphasized it in a way that gave it new impottance. The clause (c) began to change when Freud said: \"Man is not the small, simple creature he appears to be. That is only his conscious mind. Beneath this is an immense ocean of subconscious, of instinctive 'mifld', about which he knows very little\". Man thereby became something altogether bigger and deeper. But for Freud, the unconscious is in some way \"infetior\" to the conscious mind. It is as if man kept an immense herd of elephants in his back garden; they are frightening and povrer- ful; they might even trample his house dowu; but they are still elephants, mere animals. Phenomenology and Gestalt psychology together created a new concept of the subconsciorrs. Unknowa it is; here they agree with Freud. But it contains some strange principle of value and meaning that is greatly superior to anything in the conscious mind. It srill be seen that Dostoevsky's t'All things are law\"ful\" ' immediately vanishes. This was based on a misunderstanding: the idea that if there is meaning and value, it is \"out there\"l and if it is not out there, then it doesn't exist. This idea of a source of values inside man is both new and old. The concept of the inner-light has been familiar since Peter Waldo, the twelfth-century founder of the 'S7'aldenses, and has been a commonplace since the days of George Fox. But although the Quakers tecogrized the \"inner light\", God uras still an external reality, communicating with men by me4ns of a kind of internal telephone. This was the God whose death uras aflnounced by Zaratb'ustra. I doubt whether Hussed or the Gestalt psychologists in- tended anything as general and metaphysical as the statement I have made here.

Experimerrti indicrte that very young children have no colour sense. rt seems probable that our aa- cestors of a thousand years ago l:u,d fai less sense of colour than we have; there are very few references to colour in the ancient poets.

In so far as our attention is required for the details of survival, we cannot afford a sense of biauty.

It has no objective component. we are then inclined to ask th-e question: How about other human activities? How about art, for example? The art of the twentieth century could almost be called a defeatist art. our literature is full of defeated heroes, men who are crushed by society, who feel peqpetually inade. quate, while painting and music have developed an aesthetic counterpart of the \"Everything is lawful\" idea to cover their h:! gf \"anything to say\". This comes of identifying meaning with \"external meaning\" and aa undiscriminating acceptance of the.old psychology. The artist has come to neglJa the \"meaning projected from intentionality,, because he io\"s ,rot know of its existence; aflawareness of its existence could lead to a tevitaJtzarion of afi and literature in our time. This, then, seems to me the answer to the question posed at the beginning of this book. The \"origin of the seiual im- Prlt:\" is not the \"libido\"; it is an intintionality that is not corfned to sex alonb, but that also proiects the ..meaning, of man's aesthetic and religious activities. Its mode of operation Tglt be suggested by an analogy. Imagine an ofHcer iiaiog io the depth of a tank, with an observer looking out of the girn- turret. The ofEcer cannot see what is going on outside the tank; he has to rely on the descriptions of the observer, who may- say! \"Suspicious looking house with something that might be a machiae-gun behind its chimney stack,'.

But what is most important in the \"theory of symbolic response\" is the idea of intentio.ality as a \"meaning pro- iector\". - Ar,I have already poiqted out, this view raises questions that have so far been ignored as lying outside thC field of science. Nineteenth-century science thought of ..meaning', as y-9t$ng ioherent in the world, to be discovered by scrutiny. The idealists - from Locke to Hegel - questioned this view in e rarher absttact way, suggesting that some of the'.meafling,, is added by the senses. Betkeley went farthest in daiming that the world is entirely a proiection of the mind, that ceases to exist wheo there is no one to observe it - at least, that nould cease to exist, if God were not evedastingly pfeseot to observe it. In-a way, Berkeley came closest to the concepts of pheno- qrelologn in allowing man's mird the same kind of power as God. Now phenomenology seems to take a similat position.

The question we now wish to ask is: how far is inteationality comected with naturb and time? our senses are \"intentional\", projected out into the wodd of obiects by the inner-will. That is to say, they are a \"connection\" Letween the \"inner-will\" and oat.rre. Is it aot possible that other connec- tions exist? Rhine's studies of extra-sensory-perception over ttre past quarter of a century support the view that the \"fi.,re sens€s\" may not be the only pr,oiections of the hidden intea- tionality. It seems remotely possible that there may be \"other senses\" that are, at present, as unflecessary to man as the colour sense \\ras unnecessafy to the men of Homer's time. In fact, man has always possessed another \"serse\" that distinguishes him from the animals - imagination, the power of anticipating eyents. All the seoses possess an \"anticipatory,, functioa; a s-hephera can tell tomorrow's weather from the appeamnce of the sunset. No animal possesses such anticipatory powers. But imagination not only increases the strengtfi of man's aaticipa- torypowers; it can also be used as an instrumeat of ..matu fity,,, making certain experiences rurnecessary because they be anti- ciga_ted with such fullness, and thereby weakening the tynnny of the instinct that ddves us to \"fullness of experience,i. Imagination has increased mafi's autonomy more than aay of the other senses. But if we possess these anticipatory po$rers, how far does \"intentionaltty\" steer us according to anticipations of which we are not consciously aware? These are questioas that, for the moment,I aise aad leave unansurered. They are cleatly implied in the theory of sym- lolic response, but \"speculation\"'would be \" poi\",llrs proce- dure. what is needed is a scientific method o1investigatiorq possibly along the sarne liaes as the method of Gestalt psy- chologyor the study of extra-sensory-perception.

Phenomenology can suggest methods of obserration, but caa go no further. Afld nire it seems-possible that the field of aesthetics - patticularly the procedure of the creative mind - might be idaaf for the pur- pose. The gteat artist, after all, creates \"in thi serrice,, oi nis intentionality, afld the greatest art has always been a colla- boration bet'ween the conscious will and the hiddea intea- tionality. When the arist loses his belief in puqpose aad meaniag, he tends to throw the burden of creation entirely upon intentionality. Tachist painting is an example of this kind of creation; certain kinds of electronic musii another. All greati,on might be called ar'ac:.. of faith in intentionality; these fornrs of \"abstrad\" art requfue a mirrimum offaith. Wi mignt borrow one of David Riesman's sociological teffis, and iay that this \"faith in intentionality\" is aaother narne for inner- direction. (Riesman opposes this to \"otherdirectiofl', - too much coocern for what the Joneses say aad do.) This failure of inner-direction is, as I have pointed out elsevrhere,* tle chief chaacteti stic of t'wentieth-century rut and literature.Many writers on aesthetics have blamed this loss of conf,dence and purpose oa the failure of religion; they point out that gteat art has usually been religious art. But the th*ry of inrcntiona- lity is notling less than a reinstatement of the ceatral idea of religion - the ootion of a purpose that is somehow both per- sonal and impersonal, beyond rnan (as a conscious being) aad yet 'oinside\" him. It temains to be seeo, then, how far the scientific study of inteationality in art can make the artist awarq of these drives that are at once personal and impersonal, and that, translated into consciousness, are the main ionstitu- eat of great art. The ideal subject for such an investigatioo would be a creator who is also aa intelligeat phenomenologist.

My pu{pose has been to attempt to show that natrrre has no preferences. Sex is a proiection of the evolutionary intentionality. Iilhile this intentionality certainly has preferences regarding \"nor- mality\", ittakes no very efHcient measures for enforcing them. In so fat as a \"libido\" exists, it is aot the origin of the sexual impulse, but a projection of intentionality - like the aesthetic impulse, the religious impulse and the social impulse. It is possible to be \"serually normal\", but to be sexually super- normal would be to lose interest ia sex altogether, except, as Tolstoy says, with the conscious purpose of begetting child- ren. I have no doubt that Shaw is also right when he suggests that human beings, in the course of theit evolution, will lose interest in sex in the 6ense of having instinctive sexual urges. Our first reaction to such an idea is dismay, the feeling \"What a dull wodd it would be\". But this is to forget that dullness is synonymous with lack of meaning, and that the intentionality which at present clothes the symbols of sex with apparent reality is in itself the otgaa of meaning. It is true that this theory of evolutionary intentionality con- flicts with most present schools of psychology, but the ma;jor obiection is to an \"evolutionary forcn\" that is simultaneously conscious (in the serse of possessing puqposes and drives) and unconscious. But the apparent contradiction arises from the Freudian habit of using unconscious (i.e. not conscious) as a synonym for sub-conscious (below consciousness). But if the mind has a basement, why should it not also have an upstairs, equally beyond the knowledge of consciousness? Since there can be no doubt of the existence of an extra-conscious inten- tionality, would it not be more reasonable to describe it as supef-conscious lather tfr.an subconscious ? This, however, is unimportaflt; it might even be contended that the word \"superconsciousness\" is undesirable, since it suggests that it is in some way preferable tO coosciousness.

Sltaw ot Criue But now an interesting question arises: is there eaer a \"pogitive\" element in the criminal mentality?

It would be intetesting to look upl'criminal\" in a coricoidrn.. of Shaw's work. There is the important statement.. ..W'e iudge an artist by his highest moments, z criminal by his lowestr'. Apart from a brief reference to Jack the Ripper in a preface (where he speaks of \"poor Jack's horrible nlurosis,,) -Shaw's attitude towatds criminals is, on the whole, sympathetic. (See ,\\\"_19\"g .lissertation'on thern in the stage direction of Act 3 of Man and Supeiaan, the \"scum and the dregs of society,, - thosd who are too good for ordinary social employment, and those who are not good enough.) Shaw obviously believed that a_good deal of crime is a justified protest against society. But Shaw enjoyed stating things in btacks and whites, and he 264 Iiked the idea thataburglar may be a bertet man thaaan honest grocer. Admittedlr, he agreed that it would be wiser to kill certain cdminals \"ii ^ friendly and frank manner, without malice\" because they are too dangerous to be left unchained, and they cannot expect to waste the rives of other meo in watching them. In the Imprisonment preface he develops this idea interestingly, suggesting that we should destroy ail pris- ons -as breeding grounds for crime, and \"r.orrrglrs o? al kinds of vices in the warders as well as the prisirers. The habitual criminals should be killed \"without halice,, as in- corrigible q/asters of sociefy's time; but most criminals are \"first-timers\" anyway, and could be easily kept in line by social ostracism. The theory is plausible and very attructive; but unfortu- nately, at the moment, any truth it contains is \"poetic truth,,. Josephine Bell's book crime in our Tine explains why. Miss Bell begins her book with a chapter on a day of crime ia London - February 6, 196o, the day of the pEN Club murder, and lists the number of calls that the London police had to answer in twenty-four hours. The list wourd have jarred l9*, it includes innumerable assaults, thefts, burglaiies, a kidnapped baby (it was recovered in an hour, stightryBruised), and a few attempted murders. shaw's idea that wi could do without the police force is not supported by Miss Bell's chap- ter.

It cannot be called exactly \"purpose,,; is it purpose that keeps the schoolboy amused with his beetle? It is rather a form tf concentration, of direction of the attentioa. The attention longs to be directed in the way that a masochistic woman rongs to be dominated. A man feels strangely uncomfortable if b]s attention is spread and diffused. Hence the stepping on paving stones. aad tapping-lamp-posts by people who have nothing more important to \"overcome\", no other obstacle to concen- trate the will. This is plainly a question of \"values ,, . Letus have a working ilt t.! APPENDD( 267 definition of the word \"values\". Values are what determine an act of choicc. Th.y need not be \"metaphysical\" or religious values. They can be simply the factor that makes a dolnkey choose one bundle of hay rather than another. A man who \"chooses\" to tap every lamp-post with his stick feels that there are no bigger issues that he prefers tp choose at present. These considerations are the basis of criminal psychology. It is as if a man lived half amile from his work and could get to work by a direct route, but felt corzpclled to take a ten-mile detour to get to work. His workmates might reach one of two conclusions: either'that he suffers from a compulsion psy- chosis, or that he has not yet discovered that a direct route exists. A study of most crimes produces the same feeling. They give the impression that the \"values\" that led the murderer to make his act of choice were based upon absurd miscalcula- tion. The murders is usually absurdly confused about the pressures of life in sociery, about the meaning of his ourn life and in general. Ele is probably more confused than most of us; but ,it should be recognized that he only suffers from a more acute form of the bewilderment that we all feel in the face of existence. In studying the problem of the criminal mentality we rtrn into a fallacy that resembles the Freudian falTacy of \"nor- mality\" and perversionl we assume that there is a real dividing line berween saniry and insanity. In rSre the British Pdme Minister, Spencer Perceval, was murdered by a lunatic who befieved that he was the victim of a persecution plot. The lunatic wa3 executed for murder. In fi4 another lunatic named MacNaghton (or McNaughten) shot the secretary of. the Prime Minister; he also believed that people were plotting to kill him. His ttial established the McNaghten rules to deter, mine criminal insaniry; these state that a criminal must be aware of the nature of his act, ot that he is doing wrong, before he can be rightfully convicted. But we can only say that the \"values\" that led Daniel McNaghten to murderwere based entirely on delusions, while the values that led Seddon to poison his lodger for her money were based upoo a more"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"268 oRrcrNs oF TtrE sExuAL nrpur,sE complicated illusion, and upon a meanness that springs from the same psychological root as apping lamp-posts with a stick. When we call a man \"insafle\", we mean that he rnakes his acts of choice accotding to a system of values that is palpably false; they may, for example, be based oa the assumption that he is Napoleon. Benjamin Flaydon, the painter and ftiend of Keats, based his life's work on the assumption that he was a man of genius. He was not; to that extent he was \"irrsaoe\". T. E. Lawrence based his life on the coaviction that he was not e man of genius, and hid himself away as ao aircraftinan in the R.A.F, to escape the need to live up to his celebrity. But he was a genius; therefore his later conduct was based oo an illusion; Lawrence was also, by defioition, slightly insane. But all of us live on certain assumptions about what we are and what we are not, what we can contribute to civilization and what we cannot. It may seem to us that there is a very clear distinction be- tween our \"reasonable assumptions\" about our capabilities and the assumptions of a madman who thinks he is Jesus Christ. The mote we limit our perceptioas to a rlarrow, 'lreasonable\" present and its needs, the more apparent this distinctioa will become. Broaden the perceptioas to take in fiian's total ignoraflce of himself and his nature, and the liae blurs. This ignorance does not constitute insanity; but insanity is only an extreme and distorted form of this ignorance. Ctime can furdly be understood until this is grasped. How, for ex- ample, can one reach any conclusion on the case of Leopold and Loeb, ot Leonard Mills? Mills was ^ nineteen-year-old Nottingham clerk who one day decided that he would commit \"the perfect murder\"; h\" picked up a harmless woman in the cinema - a forry-eight-year-old mother of a f\"*ily - took her to a lonely spot and strangled her. He then phoned the ne\\ilrs- papers and offered to sell the st<x/, claiming he had fouod the body when looking fot a quiet spot to write a $onnet. Coat fibtes under the victim's nails esablished Mills as the killer, aad he was executed a few months later. But why did he appENDrr( z69 mutdet? He wanted to be \"different\"; he was always tfyiog to impress his friends at work with schemes for winning on the football pools and with his abilities as a poet. The murder was afl expression of boredom, like tapping lamp-posts. The same, in a more complicated sense, is true of the t'crime of the century'', the I-eopold-Loeb murder case. This is the kind of case that rnight have inspired Dostoevsky. In spite of the number of wordsthathavebeenwritten about it, the defiaitive work still remains to be written. Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb were homosexual students of Chicago university, both sons of millionaires. Leopold, the more interesting and intelli- gent of the two, suffered from various glandular disorders that caused him to beeasily bored or fatigued; his blood pressure and metabolism were low; he was anaemic and easily depressed. IThen he was fourteen a perverted governess had comrnitted various sexual malpractices on him aad taught him to perform cuanilingus on her. This developed his latent masochism. Richatd Loeb, a year older than Leopold, was a heavily built, good-looking youth, a habitual ltat and perry crimi- nal. Leopold became his slave and pathic. The murder of fourteen-year-old Bobby Franks was Loeb's ideal probably he saw in it the first step in the cater:r of two \"mastef, crimhals\". Theii heads were full of the idea of the Nieteschean supermao. But the prosecution declared bluntly that it was a sex crime pure and simple. The two youths showed flo regret at the trial; it was obvious that somehow all tltis yas not real to tbem, Both reieived life imprisonment. The key to the murder is money - the immense fotrunes of their parents. (Both were allowed to write cheques for any amount they wanted without question.) So much money meaot that there were no \"pressures\" on them, There could be no \"challenge and f,esponse\" in their lives. Freedom $ras ua- limited - and therefote boring. Because tlere had nevs been any social pressure oa them they had never needed to develop any kind of strength of character. To bring out all the impligl- tions of their murder would need a psychologist of the stature of Nietesche or Pascal.

I have pointed out in Tltc sndl of lubrder that the \"crime of boredom\" is peculiar to the tryentieth century, and cited the strange cases of Bdgar Edwards and Norman Smith. The Edwards case seems to be a case of murder as a protest against the meaninglessness of life; in some s/ays it anticipates camus's novel L'Etrarger. Norman Smith took a pistot and shot a womao through a window. He had been watching a television progratnme called \"The Sniper\", and thought he would like to try it. He was unacquainted with his victim. lhe point I am tryi,ng to make is that our complex social s_Istem has kicked away the \"values \" from under moit people,s feet once upon a time there were religious imperatives as well as the instinctive revulsion from crime. Nowadays, most of us instinctively shy from rnurder or violent crime, but could not argue at length upon the \"wrongness\" of crime as our an- cestors of the eighteenth century could. And when the instinct against murder fails we can do little but execute the crirnioal. I1-* beings living in a huge and complex society might well feel \"negated\" by it. In James Joaes's novel From-Horc to Eternitl there is a passage ia which the hero sits amoag his fellow soldiers drinking beer, and suddenly eqperieflces a feel- in_g of great happiness - of solidarity with \"the&frI,,, in spite of its brutality and discomfots; But most city dwellers never expedence an analogous feeling about the city and civilization, The peasant or worker of the eighteenth century could recog- nize thatlife is \"unfair\", that some are born rich and privileged and some poor; ngvertheless, he could accept this and feil a \"solidarity\" with society. The social order of today is alto- gether less satisfying. \"Life\" seems to bestow fame and for- tune io the oddest ways, and the 'oavetage citizen\" finds it harder-to accept. The iuveaile delinquent can feel \"Wtr.y not ,me?\" when watching a frJm of James Dean or Elvis Presley; the workman feels \"Wrhy not me?\" when he reads of someone wiaaing teo thousaad pouods oa the football pools. Crime 27r may only be a response to this intelligent perception of the unfafuness of life in modern society. The amoral attitude of the \"Beats\" as portrayed by Jack Kerouac is only one stage from criminality. What is suqprising is not the dsing crime rate, but that so many people do not commit cdmes in a civilizatioa in which they feel completely negated. The paradox remains. Civilization was created when men decided to fotm into groups for self-protection. The high de- gree of comfort and of culture in modern civilization is the outcome of an immense, large-scale co-operation that would have been beyond the imagination of ^ ntan of five hundred years ago. But the sheer size of the operation negates its indi- vidual members; in less than a century, small towas have changed into cities, ffid groups of town have coalesced into giants like London and Los Angeles. Civilization and comfort mean increasing negation of the individual, and a rising rate of neurosis and crime. If the trend continues, and the over- population problem increases, we can only reckon on a crime rate that increases by arithmetical progression. Expressed in this way, the problem may seem beyond our solution. Occasionally a religious reformer annouoces ttat all our evils will increase until we learo to,wotship together as Christians. The basic perception is correcq but the solution is wrong. Th\"y think of Christianity as afl \"idea\" or a force, out- side the limits of space and time. But a study of the history of the Church will show that this is ufltrue. The Church was not held together by an idea, but by historicd circumstaaces and social forces. As these forces vanished, and some of the bdsic dogmas urere overthrown, the Chutch ceased to be a binding force in society. The idea itself is a gteat one, but society can- aot be held together by an idea, independent of other forces; and to hope for a revival of the Chutch is only muddle-headed thinking, a desire to put back the clock. Can nothing then be done? There is no one alive who can aflsvrer this question; it would require a monstrous electronic brain into vrhich was fed all the statistics about the increase in sizes of cities and populations, and all the relevant facts about APPENDTX"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"272 !
