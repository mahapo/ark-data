So ttie 'artist saviour' had to be dismissed, and Mr Eliot symbolised his dismissal by donning the uniform of the artist-bourgeois - the bowler hat ind pinstiiped trousers. A new set of literary forerunners had to be chosen.Instead of Ibsen and T. H. Huxley, it was now Baudelaire and Flaubert and Laforgue. Instead of humanism and optimism, the new basis was authoritarianism and tragedy. All of this has led to the impasse of today, when it seems that literature and philosophy are in a state of criiis. A literature that is not in touch with its own traditions cannot make any significant advances; it is as bound up with the past as science and mathematics.. But the literature of the twentieth century has been a series of rejec- tions - down to the latest reiection of ]oyce and Eliot by the Beat Generation and the Angry Young Men. As a practising writer, I am personally concerned to cliscover how literature can becomg again purposeful and exuberant. That is why it seems to me worthwhile to keep holding post-mortems on thc litcrary and philosophical failures of the past hundred years. There is no point in acceptin_g_pessimistic conclusions until you are conyincecl that they are inevitable. There are times when a slightly different approach to the facts produces completely diflerent conclusions. This ilrikcs me most clearly when reading the work of the generation that grcw up during the first world war. The critical writings of Sir Richartl Rces, for example, possess clear vision of our position today, bascd on a profound knowledge of the cultural history of Europe. F{c under- stands that great afi can flourish only where a strong rcligious or cultural tradition exists, and can also understand how thc rise of scientific scepticism has undermined religion and left nothing in its place. The forces that our knowledge sets in motion sweep us towards spiritual bankruptry and destroy all possibility of a return to a fruit- ful tradition. I can read Rees with sympathy, because he has a profound scnse of what religion means (a we thing among humanist critics), and there- fore of the impossibility of modern man being saved by u religious revival. Yet although his reasoning seems to me completely accurater l cannot identify myseH with his acceptance of our cultural exhaustion. It certainly loohs as though the forces of history were preparing to dispense with \\(estern civilisation, since 'Western man has failed to gain the conscious control of his political destiny that would make further progress possible. But is there ever a time when there is no point in trying to gain further conscious control? It is true that we know rrore of psychology and history than any previous civilisation, but what we know is still absurdly limited, ina a thousand times smaller than what the medieval churchman claimed to know about zl I t I l I I t I man and the universe. The scientific method has discredited the ihurchman's eschatology without even beginning to supply an es- chatology of its own. Only Marxism claims io replJce the old vision of man, which it destroyed, with a n6w eschatology; and there are signs in Russia that its claims are becoming less dogmatic. Most of the other ney'ologies' make no claim to replace theology; they all admi! mod- estly that- their purpose is practiial and limited. Dirwinian biology ' and Freudian psychology may seem to discredit religion; but tili make no claim to be religions in themselves. The situation can be made clear by a metaphor. For the medieval church, the map of the universe contained no terru incognita. It ' claimed to cover all questions of human destiny, divine grrr{ human psychology, philosophy, astronomy and bi6logy. Ttie great cal. tographers worked busily to aid the church; Aquinas sketched in new areas; even Descartes tried to do his small share by demonstrating that science agreed with the church about the divine plan. (The church suppressed his book.) But when the disagreementi between science and theology became too great, the scientists declared that the church's map would have to be scrapped completely. In its place was a great blank, marked from end to end 'terra incognita'. on this map, , the scientists proce_eded !o fill in whatever small areas of certainty thqy-had gained. They allayed any panic that their supporters might feel by explaining that, in due course, the scientific method would cover the whole-universe just as thoroughly as the old map, and that, what is more, the new map would bt guaranteed to be absolutely accurate. Eut,for many years now, the scientists have ceased to make any such claim. Some of them, such as |eans and Eddington, admitted that they needed religion to complete their map of thJuniverse. Another philosophical school, of which Bertrand Russell was a representative, . lrr declared, in eflect, that it doesn't know how to complite the mapi but that it -prefers the discomforts of scepticism to wild g,r.rs.r urid assertions that seem to be born of wishful thinking. So now, after a h_undred years of scepticism, the map is still labelled'terra incognita'. Unforfurrately, most creative artists and thinkers cannot live happily ,i in Lord Russell's state of stoical agnosticism. Rees is right to pointbui that we must either fill in the map or become enfeebled by i creative anemia. ' This enables me to define the cause of my own optimism. I would"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":".. . define my viewpoint as'religious'only in the sbnse that,like anybody else, I would prefer as little terca incogruita as possible. My disagree- ment with Freudian psychology and logical positivism is not directed against their positive aspects (i.e., their heuristic aspects); it is more often an irritation with the positivist who declares confidently that it is all right with him if the map neyer gets filled in, and who feels that he is thereby defending the scientific attitude. It seems to me that we may be closer to a solution than we realise. The nineteenth-century attempt to create a new map may have failed; but it had its moments when it looked as if it might succeed. It is impossible to read many writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and not feel how nearly it succeeded; the works of Zola, 'W'ells, Tchekhov (who, strangely enough, was a great scientifi.c optimist) are full of premonitions of the new'authorised' map. This brings me to the subject of the present book. As I said in my Preface, it struck me one day that many writers of ficti<ln about the supernatutal are making their own halfhearted attempts to supply themselves with a new map of the universe. They may or nray not try to create a consistent 'system', but you can often scc, frottt a mere phrase, an image, a symbol, what kind of 'map'a writcr has in mind. At this point, one always asks the same question: If this writer's vision were true, what kind of universe would it presupltost? In short, the serious writer, no matter how feeblc his talcnt, must always sketch in some kind of meaning over the terra inc<tgnita before he can create in comfort. This, it seemed to me, is a new way of approachirrg the whole problem in our'predicament'. The workings of thc inragination rnight provide the clue - for it is the imagination that gocs to work on 'familiarising' the terra incognita. Philosophy begins from the assumption that thc rtap can exist. Otherwise, the whole discussion would be pointlcss. 'W'ittgcnstein de- clared that such a map cannot exist because all the iurportant things are unsayable, but his opinion is not general. Russell cl cfi ncd ph ilosophy briefly as 'the attempt to understand the universe'. The Russell view is the trafitional basis of philosophy. If this view is accepted, then the 'plan' is possible, cven if it has to admit that certain things fall outside its rangc. \\ilfle might say that it already 'exists', in the sense that the answers to'all mathematical . problems 'exist' even if we do not happen to know them. And one method of finding the answer to a problern is to try out various sol- utions to see if they 'fit'. Even solutions that fail hopelessly can give an inkling of the nature of the correct solution. 22 the way these facts can be interpreted and, indirectly, something about the nature and implications of the facts. Imaginative writers are like philosophers in one important respect: : generally speaking, the more they'attempt to be universal, the more iheyarelikelytobeinaccurateindetail.Andsometimesthisinac. curacy is so consistent that it can be regarded as a kind of astigmatism. The present book is a study of the inaccuracies of the imagination, ' because the inaccuracies of diflerent imaginations tend to cancel orie another out, and what is left is a perception of the general laws of ' imagination. These inaccuracies'are sometimes so compulsive as to qualify as diseases. But the 'sick imagination'is only a starting point. t The moment one uses the word'sickness', one has admitted to having ' an idea of the meaning of health, of normaliry. And normality sug- gests the idea of an underlying order, a basic pattern. This pattern is, I suppose, what Plato would have called'reality'. Hence this book could be-ialled an attempt at a classification of unrealities, with a view to ..defining the concept of realiry. r. This chapter, ineidentally, contains another example of )oyce's belief in his own 'vision of reality'. After the 'older generation' of Irishmen have each told stories illustrating their idea of the noble or enterprising side of Irish character, Stephen tells his minutely realistic, apparently point- less story of the two old women. |oyce's criticism of 'false realities' is again implicit.

He began T one of the worst and most florid writers of the twentieth century, but finally developed a ...tri.t aiscifhne and econoPy - although-he always remained fond of words lilie 'eldritch' and ;grotesque', and such combinations as ;fUit clutching fr\"i.'and 'staik utter horror'. Two short novels, Thu {ioai* Out'fiTime, and, The Case of Charles Dcxrer 'Ward ate iertainly minor classics of horror fiction; while at least a dozen stories to upset his friends. The hero of 'The Haunter of the Dark' is a writer whdcomes to a very nasfy end; the wdter's name is Robert Blake, and the story is dedicat-ed to his fellow author, Robert Bloch. L t!_. Pme story, Lovecraft mentions a treatise on magic by the Comte D'Erlette, in whom one cannot help zuspecting a sly reference to August Der; leth. But the stories of 'Roberi Blake' mentioned in 'The Haunter of the Dark' have titles that might be by Lovecraft himselfi 'The Bur- rower Beneath', 'The Stairs in the Crypt', 'shaggai', 'In the Vale of Pnath'. It seems as if Lovecraft is saying: 'As a writer of horror stories, I am exposing myself to the same horrible forces that killed Blake'- as if, that is, he is also trying to frighten himself ! Lovecraft's early tales follow the usual pattern of ghost stories: man enters haunted house, leaves with his hair white. But he is very far from being satisfied with ordinary ghosts of the Shakespealg tyPe (who can [o nothing but walk the earth and utter warning of catas- irophes). The horrors have to be tangible.s And in s-ome of the stories, the efiect is one of abzurdify and pithos. A typical example is a -tale called 'The Lurking Fear', leaning heavily on the sfyle of Poe and Mrs Radcliffe. ('There was thunder in the air the night I went to the de serted mansion atop Tempest Mountain ...') Th9 story takes place in modern times, in i remote place in the Catskill Mountains, where \\Tashington Irving set some of his weird tales. This is typical of Love- craft;he-is willing to make his setting modern, but it must be remote from civilisation,-a kind of admission of defeat. A week before the story opens, a whole village has been_destroyed by sfrange forces that ur. .ot]rred up by a storm. There folrlows a charucteristic episode; the naruatir go.t into a wooden hut to shelter from a storm, taking with him a r.irprp.r reporter. The reporter looks out of the window, and stands there tihrorrgiort the storm.'\\?.hen the narrator touches him on th. shoulder he-is found to be dead, his head'chewed and gouged' by some monster. -'Ar,.yore who has seen a modern horror film will recognise the tech- niquei there have to be a number of innocent'fall guys' yho;e role is to be killed by the 'hortor'. At the end of this story, the horror is revealed to be a horde of gorilla-like demons (of serni-human origin) who live underneath the'deserted mansion'. If it were not so atrociously written, this story would b9 frryty. Lovecraft hurls in the adjectives ('monsfrous', 'slithering', 'gho-ulis!', 'thunder-crazed') until he seems to be a kind of literary dervish who eibbers with hysteria as he sPins. \" Bot he musl have realised that this kind of thing would terrify no one but a schoolboy, and soon he set out to build a complicated and I I i t',t I I deserve to survive '\\[hat is so interesting about Lovecrdft. is the extraordinary con- sistency of his attempt Io u,ndermine materialism.

An old man who lives alone is so fascinated by ^ book about cannibals that he becomes a cannibal himself. The scene in which the old man drools over the pictureofthecannibalbutchers,shop,losinghiscautionashegets carried-away- while speaking to the narratbr, is an accurate piece of psychological observation, recalling the sketch of a difierent kind of pervert in ]oyce's story 'An Encounter'. But Lovecraft's clumsiness. comes out in the catasfrophic end of the story - the house is struck by -^ thunderbolt as the narrator notices blood dripping through the ceiling. ' somewhat more skilful, though the ending is as.clumsy as ever, is another story of the same period, 'The Rats in the walls', in which a man restores his o]d family mansion and goes to live in it. At night he hears the sound_of scurrying rats inside the walls. Investigationln the basement reveals a flight of steps that leads down to Jubtcrranean caves which contain much evidence of some old witch cult. Love craf.t was here connecting_his horrors with ancient cults - the worship of cybele and_ Atys. (one wonders if he was influerrcccl by profeisor Margaret Murra|, whose 'witch Cult inwestern Europe ir*. out in rgzti Professor Murray believed witchcraft to be a jurvival of the worship of pre-Christian nature deities.) But it was not until ry28 that Lovecraft finally devclopecl the 'mythology' that gives his subsequent work a certjin internal con- sistency.-He produced a story called'The Call of Cthulhu'(the unpro- nounceable narne is typical), about which he wrote latei: ,Ailhy: stories, unconnected as they may bc, are based on the fundarnentil lore or legend that this world was irrhabitcd at one time by another race who, in practising black magic, lost thcir foothold ,.rd *.re .x- pelled, yet_live on outside, ever ready to take possession of this earth again.'a Like most of Lovecraft's s[orics, 'Tlrc call of Cthulhu, is powerful _and interesting in its first half, thcn tails olf into vague horrors. He begins by quoting Algernon Blackwood to the efiect tf,at thele may still be 'great powers' surviving from a remote period in e-arth's history, powers hinted at in legendJof gocls and moniters. But the_story seems'to owe more to Madinre Blavitsky,s Secret Doctrind yith its myths of Atlantis and Lemuria. It opem with the typical Lovecraft statement: 'The most merciful thing in the workl, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correJate all its contents.' This is the usual romantic pessimism, aimed against science. The subf ect of the s_tory is the idea that at certain times, the 'dark powers' find con- ditions better for influencing the earth. A sensitive young artist has dreams of the early civilisation of Cthulhu. AII over thJ world dis- turbing things happen: cranks and visionaries multiply, there are voodoo orgies in Africa and Haiti, a painter exhibits f 'blasphemous Dream Landscape' at the Paris Spring Salon of. 1926, people commit suicide, etc. Then follows a narrative of a police inspectbr who ar- rested a gang of men engaged in black magic orgies in the swamps near New orleans, and gathers more evidence about the 'Great old ones who lived ages before there were any men'. The third part of the story_tel]s of the experience of a sailor who lands on a strange island that had risen out of the sea and finds a ciLy of great stone blocks carved according to some 'non-terrestrial geomefry'. (This is one of Lovecraft's favourite phrases; it occurs in many of the tales, and proves that Lovecraft was no mathematician, since he thought there could be a difference befween geometry on the earth and else- where.) Then great Cthulhu himself - an indescribable gelatinous Thing - emerges. The evil odours from Cthulhu's tomb aJcend into 'the shrunken and gibbous sky'. Finally, the island sinks back into the sea. Aften g?8, Lovecraft _fr_eq,ently drew on his cthulhu mythology to explain-his 'horrors'. Many of his stories are set in New-Englaii _(qo dlubt because it was the scene of the witch trials), and Loveciaft's New England is overcrowded with Cthulhu's friends and relations. A {qry called 'The Dunwich Horror' again exploits the theme that the 'old ones' would like to regain conlrol of-the earth. on a remote Massachusetts farm, a deformed albino woman gives birth to a hirleous, hairy child. The child is a fully grown ad'ult in six years, when he takes up the family heritage of witchcraft, and begins to rear a sfrange monster that feeds on cows. He also tries to borrow from various university libraries a 'blasphemous volume' called the Necro- t-tomi9gn. (This tutns up in several^of Lovecraft's stories.) Finally, he is killed by a dog when trying to steal the volume, and is'foundio be a semi-human creafure with tentacles hanging frorn his belly, eyes in his hips, and a trunklike tail; his propoitions 'seemed to foilow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth'. How a mere house dog managed to kill him ii not explained. Then the mon- ster escapes and begins to destroy whole villages: it is also invisible.In the end, a group of occult students manage to destroy it by muttering spells. z8 29"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"There are several more stories in which Lovecraft uses his Cthulhu mythology as ttre basis of the plot. The theme is always the same: the strange beings from beyond space and time who want to take over the earth. In 'The 'l7hisperer in Darkness', the beings are crablike creatures from a planet beyond Neptune. One of the most effective of these stories is 'The Thing on thi Doorstep', which has some un- / usually horrible touches and which utilises Lovecraft's favourite idea of incubj who can steal a human body, expelling its rightfiil owner. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that Lovecrafi is a very bad writer.'When he is at his best, his style might be mistaken for Poi's. (A - tale called 'The outsider', about a monsfrous-looking man who does not realise that he is monstrous until he finally sees himself in a mitror, owes something to 'Villiam \\[ilson' and perhaps to 'W'ilde's Birthday lf the Infanta; it might easily pass for an unknown work by Poe.) But he makes few concessions to credibility, in spite of his desir-e to be convincing. His stories are full of horror-film conventions, the most irritating of which is the trustful stupidity of the hero, who ignores signs and portents until he is face to fice with the actual !or19r. ('T'here was something about his voice which gave me a vague thrill of horror, but which I could not quite place . . .) eu his stoiies have the same pattern. - But al$ough Lovecraft is such a bad writer, he has something of the same kind of importance as Kafka. If his work fails as literaturi, it still holds an interest as a psychological case history. Here was a man who made no attempt whatever to come to terms with life. He hated modern civilisation, particularly its confident belief in progress and science. Greater a-rtists have had the same feeling, from Dostoevskv to Kafka and Eliot. They have used different tecliniques to undermine m1n's complacency. Do_stoevsky emphasised the human capacity for sufferin-g and ecstasy; Eliot emphasised human stupidity ,ri fotility. only Kafka's approach was as naive as Lovccraft's. iJe also relied simply o-n_pres-enting a picture of the world's mystery and the uncer- tainty of the life of man. Possibly f-ulure generations will feel that Lovecraft is 'symbolically ttue'. A book I was given as a child illustrated the vicw of man h.eld bi modern psychology. In it was a picture one half of which showed a little man with a bowler hat and briefcase on his way to the office. Below the gdqg o{ tJr. pavement, apelike creatures starc up at him. In the second half of the picture, the little man is asleep, now the apelike creatures are clambering over the pavement and invading his world. ' The area 'below the pavement' represented the subconsiious mind. Thomas Lovell Beddoes expressed the same idea: ,. . if man could see The perils and diseases that he elbows Each day he walks a mile. This is a sentiment that Lovecraft never tires of expressing. He finds an efiective symbol for it in a stori callei''pickman's Model'. Pickman is an artist who lives in Boston, and who specialises inpainting morbid zubjects-'Ghoul Feeding', for example. - tovecraft's motivation appears with particular clarity in some of Pickman's speeches to the narrator. 'The place to live is in the North End. If an aesthete were sincere, he'd pui up with the slums for the sake of the massed traditiofis . . . Genera.tion after generation lived and felt and fied there ... in days when people weren't afraid to live and feel and die ... cotton Mather, dimn him, was afraid somebody might zucceed in kicking free of this accursed cage of monotony.' Qppressed blr the ordinary, Lovecraft keeps declaringpassionately that the extraordinary exists. There is nothing unusual about this; it is the pattern of all creative artists. Some writl about heroism, some about sex, some about zupernafutal grace, some about'outsiders' and rebels. But the great artist tries to reveal the extraordinary that is always present in the world; Lovecraft, a hypochondriac, creates'other worlds' in a fever of spite. Pickman takes the narrator to a cellar in the slum quarter which he uses as a studio; there, at the side of a boarded-up well, he paints horrible monsters. Later Pickman disappears undei sfrange circum- stances, and his friend finds a photograph of one of the hoirible mon- sters in the cellar. It has evidently been taken from life, the inference b_eing lhat tlese monsters really exist below Boston, and come up through the disused wells. Some interesting aspects of this 'hypochondriac' Lovecraft are re- vealed in certain of his letters and essays. In a rather vague way, he was an anti-Semite, but the anti-Semitism is so obviously the emotional r_esponse of a sick, introverted man that no one could regard it as dangerous. Like'W'. B. Yeats, he was something of a snob, and liked to assert that he was a 'gentleman' by birth (although his father was a_ctually a commercial traveller); he was proud of being a .light skinned, fair haired nordic', and speaks contemptuously of the'loath- some Asiatic hordes who trail their dirty carcases over streets where white men once moved'. He writes in another letter of his 'mad physi- cal loathing' of Semitic types, and says that he has often felt cipible of murdgring a score or two when iammed in a New York subway train. All this is strangely adolescent; it is not a carefully thought-out 3r 3o a, il,l"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"i.'::, \"i i...,.! ' attitude, like Houston Stewart Chamberlain's anti-Semitism, but the ' emotional response of a fundamentally good-natured but weak and shrinking man. His only attempts to state his beliefs in intellectual terms are certain philosophical essays of no great merit. One of them, ' 'Nietzscheanism and Realism', declares: 'There is no such thing, and there never will be such a thing, as gpod and permanent government - among the crawling and miserable vermin called human beings.l He exalts the 'urge to supremacy', but ends typically: 'It is good to be a r' cynic; better a contented cat; best not to exist at all.' All this is simply a half-baked Schopenhauer pessimism, with echoes of Nietzsche and Hulme. (Although Lovecraft almost certainly Rever heard of Hulme; he was totally.ifnorant of fwentieth-cenfury '', literature, and some of his letters to Derleth reveal the usual ado- , lescent intolerance about it.) All the same, Lovecraft is not an isolated crank. He is working in a recognisable romanticfradition.If he is not a majorwriter,he is psycho- logically one of the most interesting men of his generation. And his work makes the best possible beginning to a study of the problems of imagination. W. B. YEATS Lovecraft is interesting mainly because he is a perfect example of the 'escapist imagination'. It is hard to agree with August Derleth that his death was 'a great loss to American letters' because he had not yet reached'the fullest development of his powers'. It is doubtful whether Lovecraft had any more to say. As it is, he wrote far too much.'More- over, since he so determinedly created an unreal world in opposition to the real world, it seems that he willed his own death. His whole life is a spectacle of. self-destruction; he strikes one as being like a chronic alcoholic or a drug addict. For this reason, it is interesting to compare him with V'. B. Yeats. 'W'e tend to think of Yeats as a combination of poct and politician; h-e has been compared to the older Coethe. And yei Yeats, like Lovecraft, created his own world of myths and synrbols, and tried to force it upon the 'real world'.There was a grcat dcal in Yeats of the nineteenth- century messiah-artist. In an essay on Shcllcy's poetry, he writes: 'W'hen I was aboy in Dublin, I was one of a group who rentcd a room in a mean street to discuss philosophy ... I thorrght . . . that if a powerful and benevolent spirit has shaped the destiny of this world, we r:an l;etter discover that destiny from the words that have gathered up the heart's desire of the , world, than from historical record.s, or from speculation, wherein the heart withers. Here can be seen the anti-science attitude at work. '!V'hen one thinks of Arnold Toynbee's vision of the purpose of history as a 'prep aration for the Beatific Vision'6 or of the philosophy of Hegel, it is hard to agree with Yeats. , Yeats goes on to state that he has studiedPrometheus Unbound as a ''sacred book'. In the Autobiographies, he also admits the enormous influence on him of certain lines about the 'Wandering |ew, from Hcllas: Some feign that he is Enoch; others dream He was pre-adamite, and has survived Cycles of generation and of ruin. This'old few'lives: . .. in a sea-cavern 'Mid the Demonesi,less accessible Than thou or God... and he is the receptacle of all wisdom - a prefiguring of Shaw's An- cients tn Bach to Metbuselah. Yeats adds that he was attracted to the Theosophists (Madame Blavatsky's followers) because they affirmed the real existence of the |ew (or of his like, the 'Masters' of Tibet). Yeats unites in himself all the late nineteenth-century revolt against the Age of Science that characterises figures as disparate as 'William Morris and Oscar'!Vilde. He dislikes London's miles of stone and brick, and dreams of some |ohn the Baptist who will summon all the city dwellers into the wilderness. He recalls a remark of Ruskin: 'As I go to my work at the British Museum, I see the faces of the people become daily more corrupt.'His early poetry creates fairylands that will be a refuge from the materialistic world. His 'Man who dreamed of fairyland' is a successful bourgeois who believes that man's task is to make the best of this world, but who is shaken by sudden glimpses of the 'other world'. The fishes raise their heads and sing of a 'woven world-forgotten isle . . . where Time can never wat a lover's vows'. This is the'Land of Heart's Desire', where 'even the old are fair f And even the wise are merry of tongue'. Fairies lure away a child, singing: Come away, O human childt To the waters and the wild 'With afairy, hand in hand, For the world'smore full of weeping than you can understand. 32 33"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":", ', ':'|'. u, ,i\\rj This would seem to be harmless enough. But Yeats declared that his fairies existed. chesterton quotes him,\"in his Autob iography:' \"Im-. agination,\" he would say with withering contempt, ,,there wasn,t ryuch imagination when Farmer Hogan was dragged out of bed and thrashed like a sack of potatoes - that they did, they had 'um out.\"' ' S_tephen Spender, describing the later Yeais, says that Yeats claimed that a carved wooden head of. a baby at the bottom of some banist'ers had spouted Greek to him. This is a -slightly different type of self-assertion from that practised ' by Lovecvaf.t. Lovecraft did his best to convince the reader oi the re- ality of his unseen world, but he never asserted in print that he had seen. Cthulhu. Yeats's extraordin aty attackon the'materialistic world' reached a climax in a strange book called AYision like Blake, Yeats felt that he had to 'create h\"is own system, or be enslaved by another man's'. It speaks for his good sense that he was not able to embrace any of th-e currently fashionable anti-materialistic systems, spiritual- ism or Christiart Science or Theosophy. But his own system was a s_trange hotchpotch of Boehme, astrology, Blake and ttreories about the great artists of the past. It is aimed at systematising the human personality, sornewhat after the manner of Jung's 'psychological Tp.r'. Two mental extremes are posited - total subjectivity and iotal objectivity - and these are comp ared to the full moon and the new moon. All types of human personality are then compared to the various_phases of the moon.6 AYision is Yeats's counterblast against Freud, his own 'mystical psychology'. But the chief interest of the book lies in Yeats's claim that it is of supernatural origin. He explains that Mrs Yeats often went into frances and produced automatic writing. (This explanation was an afterthought; the book was first published privately in ry26 and the information about its origin in ryzg.) Supernaiural 6eings were trying to communicate with Yeats fhiough iris wife. They f,eclared, adrnittedly, that they were not offering him a new philosophical system, but only 'metaphors for poetry'. There was alsoinoth& race of supernatural beings who wanted to keep this knowledge secret, and who often'frustrated' the dictating spirits. It is worth noting that Yeats admits that he cannot be said literally to 'believe' everythiog I,. has written. Years latcr he wrote a poem, . 'The Apparitions', that begins: Because there is safety in dcrision I talked about an apparition, I took no trouble to convince, Or seern plausible to a man of sense . . . r;*:\";\"x:::!;T*T:',i*?,ff o,n,,, (Yeats's italics.) So one is inclined to ask the plain question: was the whole story about automatic writing a hoax? The answer is almost certainly yes. An anecdote in the Autobiographies is revealing. yeats carried on a running battle with an Irish nationalist orator, Iotm F. Taylor, for Tany ye-arl. one day, at a pafiy, Yeats declared that five out of eyery s-rx pe_ople have-seen a ghost. Taylor fell into the trap and proposei that _they _ask the people presenf. Yeats arranged thit the hrri t*o people to be asked should be peo,ple who actuiily believed they had seen a g]ros_t, an_d, Taylor was so disgusted that fre aia not pursue the matter further. Yeats quite deliberately cheated, and makei no bones about admitting it. He felt that he was fundamentally right, and the 'practical politician'Taylor was wrong, and he obvioujly ihought that the end justified the means. It is instructive to compare Yeats with another modern founder of a 'sys!eq', George Gtrdjieff. Yeats believed that the poet must wear a mask, his 'anti-self' as self-protection; Gurdjiefi wai ako a man who 'acted' all the time. Gurdjieff's AII and Everything tries to increase its g$ect of beinf sacred scripfure by deliberate obscurity; so does yeats,s Yision. Gurdjieff also created a Complicated theory oi the human per- sonaliry,- tied up yith the moon, planets, elements, etc. (which 9\"r.p-.\"r-Ly expounds in all seriousness in his books on Gurdjieff). And both tried to give their systems authenticiry by creating legends about 'hidden masters'. But in Gurdjieff it is cleir that he is Iryi\"ng to 31o_d.!his_system on the religions of the past, trying to make it-asslni- lable by all fy_pes of_people. Basically, it is a penetriting and profound py*glogy.r dressed up $ a religion. one is reminded of itrrgR.r\" Machiavellian essay on the State and Religion, written for his pitron, Sit s tu{yig, in which he tells the king that rhe people must 6e kept trppy with the ]ies of religion; only thl king *,rit itand apafifroir the deception, unhappy in his knowledge, yit godlike. yeati also felt that cefiain deceptions are necessary if pebplJare to hold the right attitude to fruth. He was vaguely in favour of Catholicism becausJhe felt that its legends, dogm_as and hierarchies are such 'necessary de- ceptions'. And his own work reveals the same principle. But a full understanding of Yeats cannot eiist until one basic fact is understood; there was a certain pessimism at the bottom of his vision of the world. This-pessimism is_ the usual nineteenth-century feeling that the 'world of matter' and the 'world of spirit' are oiti-ately :1, , fl, fi; i'\\- ,*-ry- :.: .r, r !l:: i,^., ii' 74 35"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":", ., irreconcilable.

The Heqrt: \\7haf theme had Homer bqt original sin? This is -simply another form of the pessimistic assumption that truth can be of no use to man. Art is liei, but yeats prefeis to be an artist. In another poem he says of himself (speaking of the sexual instinct): 'But a coarse old man am I; I choose tLe second best.'This is not simp_ly tlr. resignation of the 'sinner' who intends to keep on sinning-. It is based on an ultimately Manichaean posifion: the spirit is qood, the world is evil. This emerges clearly iri a late po.*-, 'Th. Circus Animals' Desertion', in which the poet considers all his early symbols and legends - usheen, the Couirtess cathleen, Red Han- rahan, etc. - and admits that they were merely an attempt.to 'evade reality'. Those masterful images because complete Grew in pure mind, but out of what began? A mound of refuse tlr the sweepings of a street. . . .. . Now that my ladder's gone I must.lie down where all the ladders start, In the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart. Art, Yeats is saying, is'e_scapism'. The reality is the stupidity and ignobiliry of the world. And even if the world ian be tranjormed by play-acting and ideals, we are still basically inimals. |ust as Sw#t seemed to be tormented by the fact that the most beautiful ladies have !9 go to the lavatory and wash themselves to keep from stinking, so Yeats turns away _with a shudder from the 'nauieating, realitli de- ejcted-by zola ar,dloyge, yet has to admit finally that it is ,more real, tlrf t pretty stories he prefers. Yeats is here vlry close to the Sartre of. La Nausde. So although_ Yeats prefers the 'Sh_akespearian fish' swimming far away from !and, he has to admit that honelf leads us to recognisl the superior reality of the fish that lie gasping on the strand. It is true that Yeats is not entirely a-pessimist. In his very late po'ern 'under Ben Bulben' he propounds a S[avian notion that ihe prrpor. of. art is to lead the,hu-ry_an ipirit upward, towards the godlik..'y.t'his own epitaph is the buddhisric:'casi a cold eye lon lifJ, on death., _ Yeats is not very far from Socrates, who cheers up his disciples in thePhaedoby statilg that, sinie the philosopher sp..rds his lifeirying to_separate soul and_body, death is the consummition of philosophy. (T$ statement produces in me a more total revulsion than any other in Plato.) The same pessimism appears in the last lines of an earlier poem: #H{\"n'\"ui.ffi'\"::ilil;rx',-i.'.. Man's convictions do not repres6nt a supernatural reality. He must convince himself, .tell himself stories, invent religions - but the re- ahry.mocks his visions, and he only consumes himsif. , thr: is partly an overcompensation for the earlier belief in fairy- land; he is throwing out the baby with the dirty water. Many greit artists have felt that their best work flows through them, using ih.* as an instrument. Yeats is here declaring: 'Not at all. Man consumes himself ba his creation.' There was a\"famous episode in a Marx Brothers film in which the brothers steal a train, ttre train runs out of coal, and^they begin breaking up the carriages and piling them into the fire; finally_thqy break up tfie engine itsetf and pustiit into rhe furnace, until the train is only a furnace on wheelJ. tt ir describes Yeats's.conception _of the working of the creative faculty. It will be seen that Yeats and Lovecraft have m,rcli in common in their way of seeing the world and art. Both see it in terms of a self- destructive pessimism_. Yet they both had the good sense to keep their pessimism and their living-in separate comparfments. Loverrait ^ y have believed that life is hideous and deaih is even worse, but he didn't commit suicide at an early age. Although yeats was regarded, in later life, as the great poet of his time, he cultivated a kind\"of seH- mockery, and deliberately exaggerated some of his crankier notions in order to encourage an attitude of irreverence towards himself. (Even so acute an observer as Mr Robert Graves was taken in, and declared that Yeats was entirely'p-hgry') He often expressed his contempt for his 'sedentary tra&e' and foi thinkers in g6neral, and cast wistful glances,at the life of action. He could nevei escape a feeling that all knowledge is original sin, and that he would be better ofi asin ignor- ant urchin in a Dublin slum, or a drunken tramp. So, like Chesteiton, he exaggerated the human virtues.and vices. 'A.proud man's a lovely man,'he writes, and expresses admiration for'roirers and ranters'. At times, his work expresses a sort of Nietzschean cult of life worship. The young Yeats was simultaneously shocked and fascinated by tales of girls who gave themselves to the sailors in a nearby town; ihe old :i 36 37"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Yeats writes a series of poems that glory in the physical aspects of sex and in sexual violence. Out and impose our leadership On country and on town. Throw likely couples into bed And knock the others down. From a nihilistic reiection of the world, he now turns to an equally nihilistic acceptance of stupidity and violence as having somehow a meaning in themselves. Yet one always feels that he rvas not com- pletely taken in by either. Many poets of the late nineteenth cenfury carried their despair to its logical conclusion in death; Yeats was too healthy at bottom to go that far. OSCAR WILDE A clearer light is thrown upon his own attitudes and practices by considering the case of his friend and contemporary, Oscar'Wilde, for whom Yeats had a qualified but nevertheless deep adrniration. Much has been written about'W'ilde's work and his 'tragrc end'but (as far as I know) no one has pointed out the close relation between the two men.'Wilde, like Yeats, had in him a great deal of the rnan of action; this is Yeats's view in his Aunbiographies and it is confirmed in Hesketh Pearson's book on \\7ilde. \\Milde was a tough and ambitious man who wore a mask of effeminacy and boredom. Yet there remains the mystery of why he went through with the second trial when hq might easily have escaped to the Continent. It is true that he seems to have identified himself with Christ, and have believed that he had to live out a tragic destiny. But how did he come to hold this view of himself? The answer probably lies in a Manichaeism that is similar to that of Yeats. \\filde told Gide: 'My du$ to myself is to amuse myself terrifically ... no happiness, only pleasure. One must always seek what is most tragic.' \\Milde's life and work were based on two ideas: pleasure and tragedy. This can be seen clearly in the poem 'The Harlot's House'. The poet stops outside the harlot's house and looks at the party going on inside. \\Mhile the musicians play the'True Love' waltz of Strauss, the dancers spin mechanically in a kind of dance of death. The poet's misfress leaves his side and 'Love passed into the house of lust'. lg And suddenly the tune went false, The dancers wearied of the waltz, The shadows ceased to wheel and whirl, And down the long and silent street, The dawn, with silver-sandaled feet, Crept }ike a frightened girl. After the description of the dance of death, the description of the \"dur.r, strikes a curious rrote, somewhere between irony and tragedy, and shows clearly 'W'ilde's self-division. The 'sin and pleasure' fasii nate him (as, of course, they fascinated many writers of the nineties, ' from Anatole France to Lionel ]ohuson). But they also seem to give rise to a protestant tevulsion and desire for self-punishment. This mood is typical of Wilde. It can be seen again in the sonnet 'H6las', which begins: To drift with every passion till my soul Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play... and which contain some obvious sexual symbolisrn in its last lines: .. . Lo! with a little rod lf$hT,l\",rlJl:Hmltmiif - It is also present inDorian Gray,where the pleasures of sin are pre- sented as alluringly as in Swinburne, yet where the corruption that is the result of sin is presented with a George Eliot primness. Edmund \\flilson has pointed out that when W'ilde feeli self-disgust about his - orgies of luxury, he turns away to a Christian ideal of hurnility and abnegation_ rather than to Yeats's 'sedentary toil of creative art' (so repeating the pattern of 'Wagner). '\\7hen one examines his life closely, it becomes apparent that the basic f.actor in his conduct was a violent will-to-power about which he felt somehow guilty. Its final motive is contempt for other people, and the refusal ever to be an'ordinary man'. Wilde conquered London society and became.a rich man by jeering at all the standards of Vic- torian society. 'V/hen society would have liked to accept him and 'naturalise' him, he made this difficult by an overweening conceit and brutality, again emphasising his separateness. Finally, when every- thing he touched seemed to turn to gold, when society showed itself willing to idolise him on almost any terms, he again cut himself off by 'fseeking out the tragic' and immolating himself. There is here the same insane logic as in Dorian Gray and his poems. Only pleasure and superficiality are worthwhile; when they fail, the only alternative is 39"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"tragedy and-death. This perverseness is present in his refusal to try to make himseH into a great lvnter. 'I pui my genius into my life, ind on]V ml talent into my works.'

For these writers, the imagination was essentiaily tie alternatiye to re- ality. AUGUST STRINDBERG Yeats, Lovecraft and \\filde based the-ir imaginative work on rejection; Strindberg allowed rejection to drive him in-to insanify. He is piobablv lhe o{y writer who became insane and wrote himseif back tb saniti. From his plays, most readers would recognise the compulsive neurotic bias in his personrljty. But it c_an be sien most clearly in the four volumes of his autobiography, the third of which, lnfirno, has be.n described as 'one of the most remarkable studies in'abnormal psy- chology in the world's literature'.' rt is these books that link Sftila- berg with the'anti-rational' tradition. . Tt: first pa-rr, T?t Son of a servant, deals with Strindberg's childhood and his- life up to his marriage. Strindberg's father *ri, businessman who became prosperous only after a lon{struggle; so the writer's early years were spent in conditions of extrime plierty. His ;'mother was a barmaid, whom his father married only after she had borne him two children and was about to f.\"a\".e August. Fsr some reason, Strindberg \\Mas ashamed of being'irri, ro\" of a seivant,, and the {tle of the work reveals that hysterical tendency to public confession that became so apparent later. The first volume of tlie autobiography isasensitivebut-self-pityingbook.Certaininjusficesofhischtdhoo[ rankled in Strindberg's mind all his life..In his teens, he had a greai scare about masturbation which recalls a similar episode in ]Jyce,s Portrait. He read books on science and developed the interest ii al- chemy that appears in lnferno. It is with the second volume that the real interest begins. This is the notorious Conf_ession of a_Fool, which Strindberg produced in a state ojlr-stgria, and later tried unsuccessfully to supp\"reis. Its first half is a delightful love story. strindberg was #orkinf in the Royal tibrary when he received a note from the fianc6e of i friend, ,rkirg for an appointment. The woman was a bluestocking and , .oqrr.\"tt.,-l\"t Strindlerg,-in his mid-twenties, was_susceptiblJ, and he soon thought himself in love with her. She introducedhi- to her friend Barorftss \\flrangel, whose unmarried name was Siri von Essen. siri ana t[e Baron were living in a house that Strindberg,s family had once o...r- pied; when he went to visit them there, he f,ada sense'that fate was taking a hand. Soon he was in love with Siri. By this time, his previous siren had admitted her love for him, but rris ora feehnj r\"ri., tra n_othing in common with what he feit for siri. rh. \".t'r-;fi\"\" ; closer to worship.- He had no hope of succeeding; he hardly .u.\" thought of succeiding.

He began to zuspect Siri of betraying him. His poems came out; they were violent and iconoclastic, and they were violently attacked. This gave Strind- berg more reason to believe himself persecuted. A volurne of stories, Married, was impounded by the authorities and the author and puh lisher charged with blasphemy. Although h. was found Not Guilty, he felt that his enemies were closing in around him. He admits in the Confession: 'There were times when I had no doubt that my wife hated me and wanted to get rid of me in order to marry again.' Part of the frouble lay in Siri's desire for a career; Strindberg really wanted a perfectly domesticated wife who would minister to his needs. A strong anti-feminist trend had already appeared in Marrieil, and Strindberg was reviled by every bluestocking in Sweden. He felt that women in general, and his wife in particular, wished his desfruction. Siri's friends took a hand in breaking up the marriage - including a lesbian. 'When Strindberg found a love letfer from this woman to his wife, he tried to drag Siri to the river to 'drown her like a kitten'. His per- secution mania reached a climax. Ten years after they were married, Strindberg wrote his maddest and bitterest play, The Fqther, in which a scheming wife has her husband confi.ned as.insane, after torturing him with the suspicion that his child is not his own. This play, and A Fool's Confessioi, werc Strindberg's attempts at revenge on Siri. They were finally divorced in 1892. No one can read A Fool's Confession without feeling that the break was entirely Strindberg's fault. In 1893, Strindberg met Frieda Uhl, a young Austrian writer, who set out to captivate him. He wanted to talk about his loneliness, his unhappiness, his love for his children. She played him carbfully, de- nouncing marriage and praising free love. Finally they married. It was as itormy and uncertain a marriage as his first. One day a German copy of A Fool's Confession arfived; Frieda read it, and felt that some day Strindberg would turn on her as he had turned on Siri. The mar- riage began to fall apart. Strindberg turned to alchemical researches, and soon had samples of gold to show. The authorities agreed that it was gold, but were unwilling to admit that Strindberg had proved the transmutability of metals. Thty felt, probably correctly, that a m1n with no scientific training, working in a crude laboratory, had prob- ably deceived himself when he declared that his original copper had been quite pure. Strindberg and Frieda went to Paris - they now had a child - and finally separated. It is at this point that the Inferno begins. He tells how he saw her off at the station, then returned to his room and got out his chemical apparatus. His aim now, he explains, was to Prove :;: :'i.*.,,, ;, ;\",;, -;\";;';;;;, such as ihis need not necessarily be taken as proof of insanity. It must not be forgotten that any schoolboy today knows mole about atomic physics than Strindberg lbarned in his whole lifetime. It is not sur- prising that Strindberg was not sure about the difference between an ilement and a compound. \\[hat is surprising is that Strindb_erg was soon convinced thai he had proved that sulphur contained carbon: q,l # But the skin of my hands, nearly roasted by the strong fire, peels ofi in '\"i\" : scales, and the pain ihey cause me in undressing shows what a price I have '. paid for my viclory. Bui as I lie alone in bed,'I feel happy, and I am sorry I ' Luve no one whom I can thank for my deliverance from the marital fetters which have been broken. For in the course of years, I have become an atheist, since the unknown powers have left the world to itself without a sign of ' themselves. c 'The unknown powers'. The phrase is strongly reminiscent of Yeats - ,, rot to mention Lovecraft. But Strindberg is altogether less detached than Yeats. He goes on to tell how he wrote to his wife and told her that he was involved in a new love affair. (This was untrue.) His bleeding hands cause him so much pain that he has a general break- down, ind the Swedish colony in Paris collected enough money to send him to the hospital of St Louis (dlthoughThe Father had recently been a tremendous success in Paris, Strindberg \\Mas hopelessly poor.) There his delusions of persecution developed. He believed he was close to death. The sickness around him depressed him. His proof of the carbon in sulphur gained no recognition from the authorities. But he pressed on, and, orrleaving the hospital, set out to prove jhat Sulphur is , .o*pound of carbon,:hydrogen and oxygen. He declares that he soon established this to his own Jatisfaction. A minor incident is typi- . cal of his state of mind. On the window of a laundry, he discovered a shop-sign consisting of the initials A. S. (his own) on a silver cloud; he read this as a proof that he would succeed in his chemical researches. ' His fortunes improved slightly; he was allowed to work in the Sor- bonne Laboratory. For a time he was happy. He found that his mind was turnirg uguirrt his early Darwinism and atheism; he began to . develop a vigrri religious creed. But his various delusions and manias were iatching up with him. He saw signs in everything. Looking through a milroscope at a nut k'ernel one day-, he s-ary two tiny white hands stretched out towards him. Noises disfurb him; pianos are played in the next room (three, according tostrindberg)and_there are Lam-.ring noises. He believes this to be a plot of some Swedish blue- stockings, and changes his lodgings.

He makes the acquaintance of an American artist, and becomes convinced that the artist is actu- aJly a quack healer called Schlatter who disappeared from America in the previou! year; he proves this to his own satisfaction by comparing Schlatter's handwriting with that of his artist friend; birt thJ artist claims he knows nothing about Schlatter. It is possible, of course, that the artist uas Schlatter - but it seems nnore llkely that Strindberg was becoming insane. It would be impossible to detail all Strindberg's delusions. He heard a piano playing next door, and was immediately convinced that the pianist was an old friend and disciple, now become an implacable enemy since he has married an ex-mistress of Strindberg. Strindberg is convinced that this man intends to murder him, and is relieved when he hears that the man has been arrested in Vienna on a charge of murdering his mistress and two children. But the 'persecutions'-con- tinue; Strindberg believes that they are a punishmenl for the hubris of his youth and for leading the youth of Sweden into atheism, He begins-to believe that his'enemies' are persecuting him with a kind of electric machine which is installed in the next room, and which sends out waves of 'electric fluid' that constrict his chest. Reading thelnferno has the effect of rnaking the reader feel slightly insane. But the strangest part about the book is that its author writes as if he is convinced that his delusions are real. |ust as he wrote A Fool's Confession. to punish Siri, and yet clearly revealed that he was the one who was to blame, so now he explains his delusions to the reader in the absolute certainty that the reader will agree that Strind- berg was persecuted by enemies and spirits. His speculations read like Yeats gone mad. Yeats could write about the 'unseen powers': 'They have but one purpose, to bring their chosen man to the greatest ob- stacle he may confront without despair. They contri.red Dante's ban- ishment and snatched away his Beatrice, and thrust Villon into the arms of harlots and sent him to gather cronies at the foot of the gallows .. .' Strindberg declares that the 'powers' turned against him when he began to practise black magic, and the arrest of his 'per- secutor' on a charge of murdering his mistress and children leads him to wonder if he is also a wizard who can strike down his enemies by merely willing. He tried committing suicide by leaving an uncorked flask of potassium ryanide on the table, but something interrupted the attempt. Strindberg now began a 'penitential pilgrimage' that took him first to Sweden, then to Austria, where he stayed with his wife's mother. Seraphita. Seraphita was written when Balzac was under the infltrence l; of Swedenborg; it is about an 'angelic spirit' who lives in a Swiss :; village; to a man who is in love with her she appears as a beautiful i girl; to a woman, she appears to be a handsome youth. At the end of ' the book, she ascends to heaven. Perhaps the most interesting part of ',; the novel is a long account of Swedenb&g's life and teachings\"given in i'.i, an early chapter. At all events, Strindberg was captivated by it; it L,l made him'long to be free of the earth'. (It is incredible that Strindberg 'r, should also have admired Friedrich Nietzsche * a man who would ';.' have found Seraphita wholly poisonous.) In Dornach, Strindberg's '[t. .. mother-in-law lent him volumes'of Swedenborg; he now became con- $; vinced that he had found the answer to all his sufferings. His torments 'i:, and delusions were identical with the torments of hell, as described by ''i; the Swedish prophet. It was the state that Swedenborg clescribed as ll&' 'devastation'. Devastation was the essential prelude to salvation. !' (\\filliam ]ames borrowed from Swedenborg tht term 'vastation' to 'f-1,: describe an experience of complete horror of his own existence.s) il From Swedenborg's Heaven and Hell, Strindberg discovered that 'dev- fu ' astation' consists in constriction of the chest, the'electric'sensation, ,':., attacks of feat, nightmares and palpitations of the heart. Strindberg I wrote in Legends (the last volume of the Autobiographies): 'This diag- rri nosis . . . corresponds closely to the sickness that is now so common, so that I do not shrink from drawing the conclusion that we are ap- proaching a new era in which there will be spiritual awakening and it 'will be a joy to live.' The twentieth century was to be the era of ,,: , spiritual awakening. j{ Although Strindberg's period of insanify ended with the discovery ,,, of Swedenborg, he was by no means 'a new man'. He continued to be '.1q\", 'persecuted' in various ways, and to see signs and portents in every ,i'\" i^*,,--t ^ IT-I:I-^ ^^---^.^l^ L^ -r^^^ -^.:--^l:^r^r-- t,.i, , natural occurrence.

This marriage was as unsuccessful as the others, and for the same reasons. Strindberg wanted the girl to himself; he resented the theatre. In view of his own clear realisation that he wanted a devoted, domestic woman to make him happy, his three marriages to 'career women' can only be regarded as a kind of masochism. Flarriet was flattered to be married to Sweden's greatest literary genius (and a man upon whom his own country was now heaping honours and recog- nition). Strindberg was still young - he was only fifty. But his manic selfishness and iealousy made him impossible to live with. The birth of a child acted as a brake on the dissolution of the marriage, but by the autumn of r9o3 it was over. Strindberg's sixtieth birthday, in rQopr was widely celebrated. His sixty-third birthday in rgrz was a national event; even in England it was celebrated. But a few months later, on t4 Muy, he died of a cancer of the stomach. Strindberg once wrote that he 'began to.serve his sentence as a child'. He belongs to the category that'l7illiam |ames describes as'the twice born'. For such men life seems to be a train of sufferings, punc- tuated by illusory moments of happiness whose purpose is to persuade the suflerer to increase his efforts. And yet, unlike Yeats, Strindberg never created a conscious'other world'of fairies (although TheDrea,rn. Pl.ay comes close to it). His novel ThePeople of Hemso is a masterpiece of humorous realism (although the ending is spoiled when he some- what perfunctorily kills off the hero). And his sickness may be atfii- buted to the stern 'realism' that would have prevented him from permitting himself such a safety valve. Yeats was happy to ease the strain by dividing his personality: half of him believed that reality was a rag-and-bone shop; the other half created visions of the ideal or the heroic. When Strindberg went through his crisis, the whole per- sonaliry bent and strained, and finally the whole personality accepted the'supernatural' vision. Yeats managed to simultaneously reject and accept Madame Blavatsky In short, it seems that Strindberg clinches the argurnent for the 'escapist' view of the imagination. If he had been less ashamed of his imagination, he could have lessened the strain that pushed him into insanity (or to the edge of it). As it was, his 'realistic' brain had to manufacture evidence to enable him to finally accept a'supernatural' view. His illness might be interpreted as his being's revolt against the reality of the 'prison' to which he felt he had been sentenced. And yet it might be felt that Strindberg's method was more cour- ageous than that of Yeats or Lovecraft. They allowed their dislike of lrealityt and their desire for another world to persuade them of the existence of another order of realigy. Strindberg resisted until he was ready to snap,'and then gave way unwillingly. CONCLUSION Strindberg makes no 'assault an rationality'. He distrusts life and he dislikes society. Yeats wrote of hiur: 'I have always felt a sympathy for that tortured, self-torturing man who offered himself to his own soul as Buddha offered himself to the famished tiger.' He adds that ' when he met Strindberg in Paris, Strindberg was looking for the phil- osophers' stone. This leads one to speculate what outlet Saindberg would have found for his romanticism if he had been born twenty years lhter, into the age of atomic physics, when such researches rrould have been demonstrably futile. The four writers dealt with in this chapter illustrate different atti- tudes to the 'real world', all based upon rejection. They range from Lovecraft's hysterical ass-ault on 'ttil real woild', thiough Yeats's guarded respect, to the total acceptance of Strindberg. Strindberg is like a convinced royalist who finds himself forced to condemn the king to death. In the next chapter, I shall consider the type of imagination that tries a more complicated method of outmanoeuvering'reality' - that apparently accepts the world as a rag-and-bone shop, and so tries to sidestep the imputation of 'escapism'.

Two The Implications of Realism EMILE ZOLA It was Emile Zola who taught the modern novelist the trick of being totally subjective while appearing to be painstakingly, even boringly, obfective. Although Zola spent a great deal of time emphasising his 'scientific' technique of gathering information for his novels, he was a frankly ambitious man whose object was to gain money, fame and influence - in that order. He was also the founder of the technique of writing oversexed or sordid books and claiming for them some higher scientific or artistic justification. (One of his novels has a scene in which a son commits incest with his stepmother in a hothouse; to gather information for this scene, Zola went to the |ardin des Plantes and filled a notebook with the names of strange flowers.) Some modern critics - Mr Angus '\\V'ilson among them - have argued that Zola is a very great and underestimated novelist. There can be no doubt at all that he is often a rernarkable and powerful writer. He is also a writer who has contributed a great deal of cheap ness to the modern novel. \\fhen compared with other frankly com- mercial writers of his century - Dumas and Rider Haggard, for example - there is a nastiness about his work that reveals a more obsessive approach. The reader who makes a study of his books soon discovers that they all have basically the same plan. All rnove towards climaxes of violence or of sex, all set out to disarrn the reader by telling the story in the same precise, objective tone, and all tend to lose their grip towards the end and get swept away into hysteria. A typical example is Lo Btte Humaine, which cashed in on the ]ack the Ripper murders (although the idea of the book came from a French murder case). Its central character, |acques Lantier, has inherited a sadistic trait from dipsomaniac forebearc. Zola's descrip- tion of the strange compulsion |acques feels to hurt women, and a scene in which |acques follows a woman off a train, show a deep insight into abnormal psychology. The beginning of the book demon- strates his ability to create horror and drama without overdoing it. In the first chapter, the stationmaster Roubaud learns that his young wife, Severine, was the mistress of an old man before she rnarried him. He forces her to plot with him to murder the old man. In the second is less for- in Edmund Duckworth, 49 48 S-TSTD*B"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"t chapter, we are introduced to Lantier and learn about his neurosis; there is a powerful scene in which a girl offers herself to Lantier, and he feels the awful compulsion to kill her,'to possess her to the point of destroying her'. He rushes away into the darkness, and passes near the railway line. He sees a train flash by, and glimpses in a carriage the stationmaster stabbing an old man while Severine sits on the man's legs. This is the kind of trick that only Zola would try. Yet he manages to keep it convincing. Eventually, |acques becomes Severine's lover. She is the first woman towards whom he feels no sadistic urge. They plot to murder Rou- baud. Now Zolalets the reins slip. There is a gratuitous train wreck, iust to stimulate the reader's taste for violence. Then ]acques gives way to his sadistic urge, and murders Severine. Finally, |acques and the fireman of the train fight on the platform of the engine, and drag one another off while the train hurtles onward. The book ends with the train gathering speed through the night while drunken soldiers sing and shout, unaware that there is now no one on the engine. One can almost see Zola laying down his pen and taking a deep breath of satisfaction. 'That'll shock 'em.' But it does nothing of the sort. The reader ceased to be shockable several chapters back. (Appar- ently Zola abandoned the idea of throwing in a pederastic murder as 'too horrific'.) Angus \\filson has a passage that describes a technique that boxers call'the old one-two'. He is speaking about LaTeruet The atmosphere, the scene, the growing lust of the men,Zola the artist has built these up with complete surety, but two rapes in the afternoon? No; we can't quite take that. All right, says the iournalist, what about that cry from the centre of the cornfield - Palmyre, the pathetic cripple girl, the beast of burden, has broken beneath her load, a blood vessel burst in the glare of the sun, and then, in case the reader is still resisting, the tall, gaunt figure of La Grande, the aged peasant woman, advances and prods the body with her stick. 'Dead,'she says. ''!?'ell, that's better than a wretched burden on others.' The episode is complete; the life of the peasantry, one feels sure, is like that - hard, mercenary, brutal. Mr \\trilson implies that the reader is convinced by this piling up of violence; but this is unfrue. The whole book is cheapened; it vanishes as a work of afi, and can continue only as a piece of sensationalism. And Zola, like a man who realises he has made a complete fool of himself, seems to feel impelled to go on, to plunge deeper into the vulgarity, to shout with defiance to cover his shame. In the final scene, where Frangoise is raped by Buteau (and held down by Buteau's wife), Zola tries the preposterous device of making Frangoise realise suddenly that she was in Iove with Buteau all the time. Then he makes the coup_le murder Frangoise with a scythe. This is the book that Mr \\(rilson describes as the 'culmination of'Zola,s genius,. The zola method, then, is to exaggerate the frightfulness of the world and everyone in it. \\7hen his critics accuse f,im of overdoing the sex and violence, Zola accuses them of squeamishness and hypoc- risy. In the same way, Mrs Henry wood usedto defend herself against charges of sentimentality !y actusing her critics of being heaitless. The truth is that his noveli are emoiional onslaughts of \"a kind not unrelated to that of East Ly_nn_e. But at least Zoliwas always frank ?Lo\"t his purposes and methods. He wrote to his friend Valabrbgue: 'If you only knew, my poor friend, how little talent counts in\"the search for success, you would ab_andon pen and paper and you would set _out to analyse the ways of the literiry world,lhe thousand little tricks that open doors, the art of using other people's credit, the cruelry that is necessary to run over the dear fellow writers., The novels may reyeal this calculating spirit, but the fact that he made no attempt to conceal it is to Zola's credit. It was because he loved success, and food and wine, and admiration, that zola was not 'squeamish'_about realiry. The rag-and-bone shop made the best backgro_und for the scenes of violence t[at would brini; him these pleasures. Consequently one need not pay too much atten- tion to his 'realisT' as- ?n expression of his imaginaiion. If it had paid him better to write like Mrs Henry 'wood ol \\ri[iam Morris, he would no doubt have done so. But -his realism had a quite definite effect on the imagination of his time, and it is with thij efiect that I am more concerned in the present chapter.

The technique is that of The Great Gatsby without the glamour, but their content is closer to The Wqste Land without the underlying religious faith. 'Miss Lonelyhearts' is a young man who runs the Lonely Hearts column for a newspaper during the bootlegging era. He started the iob as a lark, but the letters that come in are no ioke; they make him aware of the extent of human torment and sufiering. Lonelyhearts' attitude is close to that of Ivan Karamazov; but unlike Ivan,-Lonely- ' hearts lacks the metaphysical passion and the love of life. '!7'est wis obviouslyaware-of the parallel with Dostoevsky, for in an early scene he makes Lonelyhearts read The Brotherc Karamqzoy, and deciie that he cannot live according to Tos,sima's injunction to Iove everything. The tecl-rnique of the book shows extreme economy; it is done in a series of short, tight scenes. There is no plot in the sense of a con- tinuous development; Lonelyhearts' disintegration under a sense of boredom and futility is the only development. His editor Shrike (who is strangely like |oyce's Buck Mulligan) makes iokes about his'sub- ordinate's role as the Christ of modern America, the father confessor, scapegoat and remover of sins. But Lonelyhearts is tormented by the image of Christ. Through various episodes he is tortured by the horror of the world. Everybody else in the book is trivial, two-dimensional, shortsighted: \\Mest has already answered the question why no one is aware of the suffe,ring and horror of being human. Lonelyhearts has a glimpse of the idea of redemption through Iove when he meets a cripple, the husband of a nymphomaniac. But it is this cripple who accidentally shoots Lonelyhearts at the end of the book. Lonelyhearts rushes to embrace him in an ecstasy of Christian love; the cripple thinks he is about to be attacked; the gun goes off. Th9 at-mlfphere of the novel is stifling; there is not a gleam of hope in it. Probably its nearest literary relative is Huxley's Aitic Hay. one is_reminded particularly of the scene at the midnight cofiee stall, where the bored socialites talk about love, and a man witn a sick wife talks about his poverty, about how he is forced to overwork an old 52 horse because it is their only means of livelihood.

The only hint of a move towards some kind of religious solution is offered in the title of the second book; presumably this refers to the locusts of the Book of Revelation who appear when the fifth angel blows his trumpet, and who have orders to iniure all human beings who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.'In those days men will seek death but they will never find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them.' Howevet, the title of a book cannot be taken as evidence; otherwise, Hemingway should have ar- rived at a religious solution, since he wrote The Sun Also Rises in rgzJ. \\TILLIAM FAULKNER In \\[est, then, the imagination is paralysed.In Faulkner one discovers an imagination that resembles'W'est's in many ways, but that is also closer to Yeats in its romanticism. Faulkner's most violent and'empty' novel is Sanctuary, tbre story of how a young girl is kidnapped by bootleggers and violated in a way that would have made Magnus Hirschfeld raise his eyebrows. Faulkner admits freely that he wrote it for money; under the circumstances, it is not surprising that it brings Zola to mind. But Faulkner is more of an artist thanZola; even when the horrors fail to convince, the symbolism continues to be effective and to hold the reader's respect. There is the opening description of the gangster Popeye: 'He had that vicious depthless quality of stamped tin.'This also illustrates Faulkner's chief weakness. Stamped tin can hardly be 'vicious'. He is frequently pseudoimpressive, like a gangster talking out of the corner of his mouth. He piles in the ad- iectives to bludgeon the reader into a state of awe. The style in the later books is incredibly convoluted, and this can also be attributed to the need for impressiveness. And yet Sanctuary is, h some subtle wllt a more optimistic novel thanTheDay of theLocust. Perhaps'optimistic'is the wrong word; it is simply more alive. Like Lovecraft, Faulkner is also out to make your flesh creep. But his horrors are not supernatural; one might borrow ]oyce's term and say that he tries for epiphanies of horr_or -srTmbolic moments. A typical example occurs in the chapter that has been anthologised as'Uncle Bud and the Three Madams'. Uncle Bud is a small'boy (Faulkner here shows his usual spirit of perversity even in such small details as naming his characters). The three women are three brothel madams, who sit together and discuss the gangster Red, who is about to be buried. (Popeye shot him.) There is a quarrel at the funeral and the .\"ffi gets overturned; the bocly rolls out and falls on the floor.''When they try to pick the corpse up, the wreath comes too, attached to the cheek by a length of wire that has driven into the flesh. The bullet hole in his forehead has been stopped up with pink wax, but this falls out, and they have to pull a peaked cap down over his forehead. Later, as the three madams go on to discuss sentimentally the virtues of the deceased, {Jncle Bud gets clrunk by taking sur- reptitious swigs at their beer. Someone catches him at it. You boy!'she said, shaking him, 'stan up!'Limply he dangled, his face rigid ' in a slobbering grin. Then upon it came an expression of concern, con- sternation; Minnie swung him sharply away from her as he began to vomit. The novel ends in an orgy of horrors reminiscent of La BAte Hu- maine; an innocent man is accused of raping the young girl; a mob pours petrol on him and burns him alive. The gangster Popeye escapes, but he is ironically accused of a murder he never committed and electrocuted. 'W.hat exactly is Faulkner's purpose in piling up the horror? It is not entirely to make the book a best seller (which it was), for a great deal of his most serious work uses the same devices. To some extent, it is to set the scene for the acceptance of his own romanticism. For Faulkner's mainspring is an exaggerated respect for the past and for the gentry of theDeep South.\\71ien Faulknei writes of the past, of the early days of Yoknapatawpha County, of Colonel sartoris and General Compson, he writes with a nostalgia that occasionally expresses itself in overblown romantic language. The theme of his best novel, The Sound and the Fu,ry, is the decay of the Compson family, and when he writes of this decay, his language'acquires a crispness that springs from disgust. The family's decadence is symbolised in the 'soiled undergarment of cheap silk a little too pink' that Quentin leaves behind when she elopes with the pitch-man. Popeye had 'eyes like rubber knobs', and his face 'just went ?wrlr like the face of a wax doll set too near a hot fire'. An old man in Sanctuary has eyes like 'clots of phlegm'. 'W'hen he writes about the past, Faulkner talks about th; sound of 'distant bugles on the road to Roncevalles'; when he writes about the present, his symbolisrn airns at creating revulsion. Faulkner's County, like Lol,ecraft's New England, is full of legends of horror; but Faulkner's horror is all physical. He drew a map of Yoknapatawpha County for an anthology of his work; significantly enough rnost of the places marked on it are connected with violent death. 'Where Lee Goodwin was lynched', 'Where Popeye murdered 54 : 55"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Tawmmy', 9tc. o_ne ryggld imagine that Faulkner has a particular score to settle with middle-aged virgins, for at least two of them meet with a horrible fate in his books.In Light in Augusr, the frigid Miss Burden becomes the mistress of a Negio and is murdered by-him; in the story 'A Rose for Emily', the lady-of the title shoots her iover and tlen sleeps with his body for the restbf her life. Perhaps Faulkner's most carefully calculated and successful horror story is- lRed Leaves'..This is about ihe days when Red Indians owned most of Yoknapatawpha Counfy, as well is Negro slaves. The Indians have a curious Egyptian custom of burying islave with their dead chiefs, to act as a servant in the after-worlf,. Before the burial, they also have a ritual hunting of the slave through the swamps. Faulkner describes this hunting in completely flat language. TIie Negro is finally recaptured, and given a bowl bf water to arint<. As he irinks thirsrily,- the wate-r rl-opr- over his chin and cuts paths down through the caked mud on his body.

(There seems to be a chance that the slave will die before he i-s buried, iince he was bitten by a snake in the swarnp.) Faulkner's basic intention is the same as Lovecraft's - to som.ehow get his own back on 'reality'. He doesn't like the world he lives in. (Hence, p.$rpj, the tremendous drinking bouts that are so fypical a part of the_Faulkne-r legend.) He prefers turning to the past. And, like Invecraft, hq lpends much of hiJ creative life making ihrt past more circumstantial and credible. Through a series,of books, over thirry years, he has created his own County, a complex myth that he can oppose to 'reality'. some of his recent books ieem to show that the compulsion to live_in_the past is weakening as he grows older, as it did *ith- Yeats-; they deal with the contempoiary scelne, but without the revulsion shown in Sanctuary. ... undeniably, Faulkner's achievement is impressive; yer it is marked, like Lovecraft's, by the underly_ing feeling of neurotic compulsion a.mognjjng sometimes to sadism-Hii work licks the Homeric feeling - the feeling that is also present in Scott and Balzac and Dumas - it , man crea-ting b-ecause he loves to create, as a bird loves to sing.

ACCEPTANCE AND REJECTTON For all their diversify_of aim, and of literary merit, all the writers I have dealt with so fai have one thing in commo\", th.y *.r. \"ir roi\", littli too near the 'pain threshold'. ihere ,r. ,o*. men who see the yorld naturally as an incredibly-beautiful place; rhey carry i\";;;a;lt- hood a vision that is the normal mode of perception of rom. children (if one is to believe Thomas Traherne, Sri f.amai<rishna,'Word;;;;th, for example). If one judges by A christmas carol,Dickens was one of them; so was G. K. Clesterton; and w'illiam |ames cites walt \\rhit_ man as an example o! the 'blue sky philosophy,. These writers need have no reason for finding the _*'o.ia ,n igi\"\" ble ph;;; D;.k;;, showed himself to be as aware of evil and milice as f,ny man. They simply see it that way. Although Dickens possessed one of tt. *oit fertile creative intelligences in I'iterature, h6 never seems to have felt the need to cieate his own separate world, as Faulkner did. Characteis in one book do not recur in bthers; each book is a separate unit, like Shakespeare's plays. And this is because Dickens did not feel he was 9re3!ing a-'Dickensian' worl d apart from ,reality,. His characters may be like no human beings who ev:er lived; but, baiicrlt, tt*y r;6.;plt Dickens had known and seen. -Although_ q9r9 may be no_reason, apart from temperament, why Dickens and \\flhitman were able to accept the world tihey lived'in (at least, they had no 'quarrel with God' fbr creating it), ihis do., ,iot always seem to be true for the 'pessimistic' writlrr. Childhood in- iustice or ill-treatment seems tp hive had a rifelong efiect on Strind- berg, Dostoevsky, Poe. But thifmaybe r\".r..i\"ot a cause. There is no real evidence that Strindber_g's sombre outlook was fonned by pov- erty and injustice, any more than there is evidence that Shaw,s 6pti- mism was the result of a happy childhood. _ At all events, it seems arguable that attempts to create ,systems, and brrild separa-te worlds are i romantic-phen&nenon: that is, they aie the result of a tendency to reje_ct 'reality'. This is not to say tha't the !9\" optimists' take the world exactly_as it cornes. They'may, like Tolstoy, be intent 9y changrng it. But Tolstoy's religious system is not an integral part of his creation, as it is wittr Dostoevsky;\"it is a later intellectualisation. {f on9 accepts this proposition - that romantics are system builders - then it would appear that the real division in art is not that which exists befween classic and romantic, but the one between the born optimists and the bory-'reiecters'.

EVELYN Y/AUGH AND GRAHAM GREENE It is instructive to consider two Catholic writers whose work is an interesting variant on the usual romantic method. Like Zola and Faulkner, they emphasise_ the sordid aspects of the world to bully the reader's emotions. But unlike Zola and Faulkner, their aim is to ireate in the reader a sense of total reiection. Because he is a humorist, 'S?'augh's aims may seem to have little to associate them with the 'rejecters'. But if his world is considered with- out paying attention to the humour, it is seen that his view of .reality, is almost as hair-raisingly pessimistic as Lovecraft's.

Edmund'wilson has called this book'waugh's masterpiece, but that is putting it a little strongly. It is not funnyl and it fails to evoke the terror of.Thewaste Land, from which its tiire is taken. The one trri\"! it does do succesrfqlly is to-give_an overwhelming feeling \"i irr.lri tility of the lives of most of lts characters. It does\"this atlhe cost of steering very close,to the edge of boredom. The great novelist conveys the sensation that he loves his characters; \\ffaugf, gives tfr. i-p..rri,i\" that he is looking down on his characters from\"a \"great height] ;i;h; sadistic grin or,r his face. None of \\V'augh is unrladable (ie i6 too much sense of language for that), but thii is the least rereadable of his books; it is hard 1o imagine anyone who has managed to finish-ii ever wanting to open it again. If the book is a .maiterniece,- rhen ever_ wanting to open it again. book is a 'masterpiece', then Ttgly it is the oniy one in the world's literature with tiris pecrrliar distinction. In his next two novels, scoop and put out More Flags,'waugh ' shows his hand more plainly. It now becomes apparent tha? one of his chief values It tht^ respect he feels for the chaiacter of the f\"!fir-n {1 aristocraey. S.c9op is about a naturalist - a country gentleman -'who ge-ts sent ac-cidentally on an assignment as a *rr .o\"rr.spondent, and .ytro k:?s demonstryting, ilr a qiiet yay,_r_he zuperioritl, of ttre'frrg- lish pub^lic-school tradition.

Once again, thl aristocratic public-school strain shows it is made of the right stuff. But it is not until Brideshead Rsyisited that \\flaugh finally.shows his hand\" The book is told by Captain Charles Ryder, and if is com* posed mainly of his rerniniscences of an aristocraiic Catholic family, whose head_is a lapsed Catho1ic, Lord Marchmain. The first part of the book, which deals with Ryder's acquaintance with the son of the t1rnily, Sebastian, at Oxford, succeeds in conveying aurtrentically Waugh's admiration for the eccentricity and glarnour of his aristo- crats, anrl his detestation of upstarts, social climbers and vulgarity in general\" The snohbery is reminiscent of \\flitde\" In the second part of the book, Waugh now begins to proselytise for Catholicistrtrr, *n& there is an unconvincing deathbed scene when Lord Marchmain returns to the Catholic fold' Sebastian has gone to live in Fez with a homosexual Gerrnan, and there is a scene in Waugh's besr sordid rnanner, when Ryder pays them a visit. Sebastian's total humiliation is underscored\" Later, Sehastian has a breakdown and enters a monastery as an under* g_ardgne1, Ry'der is having a love affair with Sebastian's sister |ulia, but she finally deserts hinr at the call of the Church\" The second half of the hook is the most nauseating mixture of snobbery and sen- timentality in \\[augh's output. In a subsequent nove}, Tha Loved Cne, he refurns to his earlier manner * satire and black hun:our. The sublect of kris satire is the slickly cornmercialised Hollywood cerneteries. The objection to the book is put pertinently by Edmrund Wilson: To the non-religious reader . . . the patrons and proprietors of \\Thispering Glades seem more sensible and less absurd' than- the priest-guided Evelyi IW'augh. \\[hat the forrner are trying to do is, after all, merely to gloss over physical death with smooth lawns and soothing rites; but for tfre Catholic the fact of death is not to be faced at all: he is solaced with the fantasy of another world in which everyone who has died in the flesh is somehow r,rppor.d to be alive; anrl in which it is supposed to be possible to help sorrls io advance themselves by buying candles to burn in churches\" This remark need not he taken as an attack on Catholicism so much as of \\flaugh's sickly brand of Catholic snobbery. Waugh creates an effect of insincerity that is not the fault of his beiiefs; EhIt managed to embrace Anglicanisrn withorlt producing an impression of sellin! out- But one suspects that \\flaugh's Catholiiism hai the sarne roots is his admiratign bf th* aristoc ra;.y _ the negative basis of u airiit.-e\"\"f-;L garity. His picture of reality is deliberately depressing; he is telling the reader: 'This is what the worXd is trike, but I have positive beliefs that save rne from despair.' The 'uryggenerate world' is futile and sordid, and destiny^is likeny\" to play sudde*n frorriU; i;il-. ja\"neron Waugh, the novelist's son, shows the same tendency to black humour in his first novel The {q\"slgy e Saga.} But when tfr* reader is rhoroushi}t depressed by all_this, Waugh*offers him his soXufion _ Catholicism and snobbery' The chief troubli *ith.\\[ayrgh's Catholicism is that \\flaug]r fails to cCInvey the irypression that rr[ is a rnan *ith *r;;lent f\"or religious conviction.

The book that is likely to strike non-Cattrolics as rnost interesting is the curious Ordeql of' Gilbert Pirufatd, a ;\"f;rional, semi-auto- biographical novel that describes a 'nervous breakdn*rr; its central character succurnbs completely to a persecution rnania. h*, the first time, Yr\"gh seerns to esc_ape-from the desire to irrpress.

The point, of course, is why Pinfotd lead the bieakdown urd how'Ii* *no- aged to cure himself. Buf \\flaugh shrinks from the effort of self- analysis, never having tried to exercise it in his earlier books. One has only to comPlre it with Tolstoy's Confessiorc to realise what is wrong with it\" It is a half confession * a quarter eonfession.

Greene brings Zoli to rnind in more, ways than one; all his novels are about sex orl*riolence or both\" And there seems to be no doubt that Greene is also deeply interested in success; this makes it !r t tlifficult to believe in his artistic sincerity. Greene suppli*s a. great dryl more daia than \\fiaugh on the develop- ' fi,ent of his fersonal iririorr.

The 'splintering fingernails' are in- tended to *rk. the reader wince; the-adjective 'feebly' produces_a sense of futility. But nF{e wasn't carrion yet' is_a cheap dramatic trick, a gratuitous comment by the omniscient novelist offered as if it were orfu of Mr Tench's thoughts. The opening of The Confid\"antial lgrnt, uses the device even more flagrantly; 'The gutrls swept over Dovetr. Th*y sailed out like fl,akes of-the firg and tacked back towards the hidden town, whitre the siren rnourned with them; other ships replied, a rrhole wake lifted up their voices - for whose death?'

A road in Brightom. Rock looks like 'a yazar scar slashccl in the chalk'\" This is-in facT, a strightly different use of the Lovccraft technique. Greene aXso wants to **k* our flesh creep, so he constantly uses overcoloured words and images to clo it. Birt as with Lovecraft's constant use of 'eldritCh', 'horri\"ble', 'miasmic', ctc., the final effect is one of SeH- parody. Edmund \\flitson commented on the enormous relief of turn- hS from tovecraft's overcoloured prose to M6rim6e's cold and de- t', tached horror story nThe Venus of ltrle'. The sarne is true of Greene; one finally feels irritated by the *pathetic fallacy' th.at is always lurk- ing behind the most innocently objective description. It is a relief to turn to the novels of Robbe-Grillet, for he at least tries to keep himself out of his descriptions. Sorne of Greene's short stories are less overloaded with the pathetic fallacy, and his description of childhood torrnents and miseries pro- duce an effect of sincerity that is absent frorn most of his novels. But the obsession with failure is still there, pervading everything. In Mr Polly, \\[reltrs described provincial-town seediness and boredom with the sarne realism as Greene; but one feels that he is waiting irn- patiently for thre point in the book where Mr Polly achieves his free- dorn and reatrises that 'if you don't like your life you can change it'. Greene's equivalent of Mr Polly, the butler Baines in 'The Basernent Room', is accidentally betrayed by the child who adores him. (Baines has killed lais wife by pushing her over the banisters.) The story is tolcl from the point of view of the child, suggesting that it is the authon who is trying to exorcise a painful mernory. Yeats has a poem in which he refers to memory that rnakes him writhe with ernbar- rassment, '*y conscience or my vanity appaltred'\" But Greene posi- tively dwells on these mornents of retrospective agony, finding in them a justification for his refusal to enjoy being alive.a (His one portrait of a healthy-rninded, cheerful woman Ida Arnold in Brighton R.ock, - bristles with a |ansenist hatred.) A story called 'The End of the Pavty' can be considered as a brief epitome of Greene's method, trt, deals with a pair of rnale twins, Peter and Francis, about eigtrt years old; One is self-confident, the other timid\" They have a kind of telepathic contact. They go together to a New Year partlr where there will be games in the dark. Francis is terrified of the dark and tries hard to get out of going, but the grown- ups cannot cornprehend that any child should want to avoi d a party, and the trvins are packed off. A great deal of emphasis is laiC on Francis's sensitivity and his terrotr. Finally, the moment arrives; games in the dark ave announced. Francis tries to excuse hirnsetrf, but the other children call him a coward, and he agrecs to play. As he and his brother crouch in the dark, Peter can fecl the vibrations of fear coming frorn him. Finally the lights go on; Francis has died of terror. But Peter wonders 'why it was that the pulse of hrs brother's fear went on and ofl, when Francis was now *h*t. he had always been told there \\Mas no more terror and no more darkness'. Francis is a fright- ened ghost, perpetually doomed to terror no\\M he is outside the body's protect\"!.on. 64 65"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"A whole attitude to existence ernerged in the story. The incom- prehension of adults, the agonised sensitivity of children, and &nally the krorrible unknown behind life that justifies every terror.

I{o Coubt the setrf-induced agonies of the hypochondriac are also 'real'. Eut from the viewpoint of the unconvinced treader, the rnost irri- tating thing about the 'story is a kind of emotional douhle-shuffle. Greene appears to be condernning the incoulprehension of aclults and, by imrplication, asking for more understanding. But, as we know from Greene's other work, his pessimismr is not of the sort that will be rnoclified by a little comprehension. The universe is a black and a horri]:le p1ace, and it would still be black and horrible even if children and adutris were in constant telepathic contact. The story asks for the reader's sympathSr under false pietenses; rvhile appearing to plead fgr children, Greene is actually preachirrg his |ansenist doctrine that life is pretty awful awyway. Thk is the frnal objection to Gneene\" Ftris fundarnental position, as explaixred in the aufobiograptrical work, is valid enougtr. Like aXI *fit*ru born a little too clore }q the npain threshold', he needs to coln* pensate for the futitity and rneannesi he sees around hi,m. His 'rrtrorld ii**' is not unlike that of Nathanael 'west' -Birth' copulation and ' death', faihlre, seediness, suffering. You feel that eyen if he had to describe an oak tree in early spring, he would take care to explain that 'the leaves have a coating of toal dust from the nearby foundry and that the tree is dying anyway from the polluted river that flows-past its roots. But unlike \\ilest, he failed to take Scott Fitzgerald for a ynaster. So instead of tlee tight, ctrassical control, the delicate irony and self-ntockery, there are tremenrlous meloclrantatic gestures. Qry* ca1 imagine Henry Irving harnming the opcning of The Confidert.tial Agiwt, and sinking his voice to a hoarse whispar on the words 'For rmhose death?' Greene's adrnirers wltrI ohject that I lxrvc quotecl his serioras novels and his'entertainmlents'as if tllc'r^c is llo clistirlction. But can any author divide hls work into two t;t(t'gorie.:s lttttl declare that one half of it is 'unrepresentativc'? T[rc cl]-c ol' lrattll<trcr's Sanctuary_ argues against it. At the most, it nrc:lrrs that thc atrthor throws off certain rJstraints in writing a potborler\" Greene adruits that lSrigltton Rock 66 was conceived as an entertainrnent, and turned into a 'serious novel'\" Ttris is precisely what is wrong with it. Pinkie, th9 teenage kill-er ylo ls also i Catnoiir, is a charactir out of a B film, frankly incredible in his evil. And this is not because such youths could not exist; most probation ofifrcers have a Pinkie tmong their charg_es\" It is because Lr*.rr. takes no troubtre to take the reader inside the character; in- stcad, he relies on overcoloured adiectives, in the Lovecr af.t manner, to frighten the reader into accepting the boy as wholly wickgd, 'tjghf lipled', 'rigid', 'brutal', with hnger grinding at his guts' and 'hideous u\"it,rrn*ttral pride'. Every other sentence contains an attempt-on the part of the autfror to bludf*on the reader intg the right state of mind; ifr* sea is 'poison-bottle grJen' (what is the difference between that and ordinary bottle green?), firrt ie's eyes have 'an effect of heartlessness like those of an-old rnan in whorn human feeling has died'. and his hatred is like 'handcuffs to be fastened aror-lnd [someone's] wrists'\" But Pinkie is also a Catho1ic, so in spite of his evil, he is closer to God than the good-natured Ida Arnold, who tries to bring about his downfall. Pinkie marries a young girl (also, of course, a Catholic) to prevent her from 'talking'. On a fairground, he makes a record for her and confesses fhat he hates her. She does not play it imrnediately. After Pinkie's death, the girl visits a priest, who speaks to her of 'the ap_ palling strangeness of the mercy of God', and says that if Pinkie loved h.r, ii slaowJ trle was not beyond redemption. She goes home to ptray the gramcphone record. The book ends, 'She walked rapidly in the thin-|une tunlight towards the worst horror of all'. The -ending is reminiscent af Zala's B1,[s Huruaine; the final assault on the reader. But, as with Zala, Greene has lost the reader's credence two hundred pages back; he has cried wolf too often. But there is one effective scene in the book * the final scene with the priest\" For a moment, the reader becomes aware of what Greene is trying to say. He mentions Peguy: 'There was a Frenchman . . * who nia the sa*e idea as you. He was a good man, a holy man, and he lived in sin through a}l his life because he cotrldn't bear the idea that , any soul should suffer damnation . . . He never took the sacrarnents, he-never married his wife in church. I don't know, ffiy child, but some people think he was . \" . well, a saint.'E Greene, like Peguy, is objecting to the usual idea of damnation. He is trying to solr in eflect: 'The world seems foredoorned to damnation, and if t-n* **r.y of God is rational, there is no hope for us. But one can never tell.' Tf Brightan Roch had said this successfully, it would be an important book, perhaps even a great book. But it fails evevy pos- 67"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"sible test; its religious theme is cheapened by its rnelodrama, irs pseudoimpressive writing, its hysteria. In some of his more iecent books, there are signs that Greene is becorning eonscrous of these shortcomings. The Quiet Awyericfrn is told in the first person, and so lacks those annoyi*g interpolations from the author, those similies that are all cut to ihe iame pattern of disgust. The narrator is a non-believer, and there is no sign that Greene disapproves of his cynical agnosticism. The only sign of Greene's usual bias is his attitude towards Pyle, the 'quiet Arnerican', who represents innocent and meddlesomle humanitarianism; he is a kind of transformation of Ida Arnold, An entertainmen to Our Man in ITsvana (1958), reveals a sense of humCIur that has apparently been in abeyance for ttre past thirfy years. His most recent book at the fime of writing, A Bwrnt, Out, Case, is set in a leper colony in Africa, and is overweighted with the uzual sense of failure and futility, but seerns to have an element of 'confession' in it (like \\flaugh's Gilb ert Pinfold), since the main character, a successful architect, confesses that his enormous success is just a bore, and has left hirn spiritually ennp ty; it is hard not to identify this viewpoint mrith Greene's. The consequent feeling of sincerittrr makes the book more convincing than his last African novel, The Heart af the Matter, another protracted study in bad conscience, agony and hunnitriation that ends, after two hundred and fifty pages, 'rrhen the moujik commits suicide'. In certai.n rnatters of technique and outlook, Greene's nearest liter- ary relative is Aldous Huxl*y. i{*xley's rmor}d is also a gloomy place, divided between weaklings and fools. And both Greene and Huxley , place great emphasis on humiliation. It is significant that when Greene speaks of his 'symbols of evil' the thin partitions in the dorrnitories, lavatory doors without locks * they are actualty symbols of embarrassment. (One is reminded of a scene in Ey eless in Gaza where the schootrboys peer over a dormitory partition to spy on a hoy r:raasturbating in a rupture truss.) Shaw could accept the necessity for humiliation and embarrassrnent with the cheerful cornrnent, 'You cannot learn to skate without rnaking a fool of yourself'. One suspects that Greene and Huxley have allowed early hurniliations to colour their whole lives. But when he is compared with Huxkry, it is immediately obvious that Greene is the lesser writer. To bcgiri with, he is no thinker; he Iacks the ana\\yttcal faculty. A writer who professes to speak about the condition sf man is gravely hantlicappcd if hc rcfuses to try to define his position in intellectual tenus. It is cvcn diflrcult to freat such a writer as serious. It is not that Greene has an a priori objection to 68 using a novel to express ideasr 3s |oyce had. It is significant that the tttost effective pages of Brightan Rock are the ones in which he comes clean and allows the priesl to express the idea of the book. It would appear jhat he simply objects to the exercise of thinking, and indulges in it as little as possible. IEAN.PAUL SAR,TRE The work of Sartre is as uncomprornisingly 'realistic' - that is to sslr as sordid - as that of anf of_theirrituur airtt with in this ctapter. grlt he differs from \\flest, -Faulkner, Greene, in being an 'intellectual' whose interest in depicting human lives and the;r environment is largely-analytical. Like thern he wants to pass judgment on human. life; unlike them, he does not decide in adv*i.. oi, ttie answer. In an essay on lvlauriac, Sartre makes clear his notion of the novel- ist's responsibility. His objection to Mauriac is that he takes oGod's standpoint on his characters. God sees the inside and outside . . . fn a like manner, M. Mauriac is omniscient about everything relating to his little ruorld, \\[hat he says about his characters is \"Gospel.\"'He finished with the famous comment: 'God is nof an artist. Neither is M. Mauriac\"'These objections, of course, might also be applied to Graharn Greene; in essence, they are an odjection to the lathetic fallacy', to the novelist interposing hineself between his creation and the reader and'explalning' it. (Theie is an example in a Trollope novel - I Jorget which * where Trollope writesl '\\[ell,-reader, what ihall we s make VIiss X do? Shall we make her marry the squire?' This is an extreme example of what sartre is objecting to.) The technique of allowing reality ta rp.Ik for itself can be extended in many directions\" The novelist rnight, for example, behave as if he were simply a camera and a recording machine. |oyce tried this in the newspaper-office scene of (Jlysses, where the cries of newsboys, the noise of machinerlr the ringing of telephones and the snatihes of overheard conversation a.re all reiordecl lmpartially. The result is a tremendous confusiotl\"\" The camera-techniqrre may be effective when the action is simple, as in the early chapteis of uiysses, but it has its limitations. Another alternative ii Robtrt-Critlet's lechnique of allow- ing a whole noYel to be observed through the eyes of a single charac- ter, and pro-vidirg lgrg and careful desJriptions of everything he sees - the size, shape and measurements of eyg{y table and chair. fUis may appeal to purists, but it makes for incredibty tedious reading. But in his first novel Nause a (La T{susde), Sartre has taken the idea 6s"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"of_ obiegriy*ity to a curious extrerne. The novel is the diary of a man whose fielings keep drying up completely and leaving him-confronted with objects that seeln to crush hirn\" The hurnan mind selects and interprets wh at it sees as a matter of course ; it rations out its atten- tion, deciding what is irnportant and what can be ignotred. Sartre is saying: 'FIow can we judge what deserves attention T' 'W'e aye, of necessify, egotists who allow our feelings to dominate our lives. tsut if a man went to an extrerne of Christian humility and sat waiting for the meaning to emerge from the objects that sllrround hirn, the result rnight be that sudCen collapse of individuality in the face of the world. A simile mlght make this ctrearer. When I pick ,rp a book, I know that the author had an overall irmpression that he wanted to make, and I try to read it with an open rnind, to grasp what he wants to say\" If I have iust been reading Thomas Hardy, and I turn to Tolstoy assuming that Tolstoy sees the world in the same way as Hardy, I shall be misinterpreting Tolstoy's intention until it dawns on nne that he is saying sornething totatrly different\" Yet no matter how much X try to keep an open mind as I read some new author, I find it irnpossible not to impose my own ego on the book in certain ways. I remernber certain things with clarity anC forget others; I pry trrore attention to sorne things than to others. If it is a difficult book - let us s?|, an experirnental novel by a ne\\M author I try hard to interpret his intention, and keep tryileg out different patterns of my own on the book, to see if they fit. And I rnay feetr aware that I am distorting the book in reading it, and try hard to keep ffry own ideas and personality in complete aheyance until I have grasped what the writer wants to say\" In the same way, we hold a dual attitude towards our experience. To some extent, we are willing to learn from it, so we try to preserve an open rnind; hut we are also critical and selective; there are sorne things we lty to avoid, and if they are unavoidable, we try to pay thern as little attention as possible. If a man should try to suppress completely hi.s critical and selective faculty * perhaps because he has a low opinion of himself - he would find hirnseXf in the position of being bullicd by the physical world, crushed by it. For even if you are reading a book with a completely open rnind, you still need to keep enough of your critical faculty to be able to distinguish the words and the n)caning of the paragraphs; a book read with a completely open nrincl woulcl be only a series of black characters on paper. Unfortunatelp the worlcl is not writtcn hy an author, so there is no point in gazmg passively at one's experiences ancl waiting for the 7o atrthor's rnealirrg- to become apparent. This has the effect of causing the world to dissolve into black squiggles. That is the theme of Nau sea.-AilIoine Roquentin becomes period- ically aware that he irnpCIses order on his experience\" But he Las an e,xtremely Iow opinion of hirnself; he feels hirnself to be cornpletely ignorant of the purpose of his life and of life in general. Like many heroes of modern novels, he cornes to feel that l#e is a meaningless ritual. When he occasionally becomes aware that he is imposirf frit iu{gmen-ts on his elperience, he irnmediately suspends his iudgrilent- rnaking {acu1ty, and is sudden_ly confronted with ?tr. crushingty 'real' reality that h-e_happens to be looking at: so he is suddenly f*l'gfrtened 1nd disgusted by a stone in his hanA, by an ink bottle on tfe table. \\flhile he is writing the life of a historicai character he realises that he is also impgsjt8 his-meanings and iudgments on it, iust as the charac- ter himself did in the act of living it. So he stops writing it. F{e feels that people Yh\" irnpose rneaning on their lives by u r*.i self-conceit are 'swine';_ this feeling becornes very strong when he wilks round a portrait gallery, with its pictLlres of eminenilocal citizens. Ftre feels, as it were, that no one has a right to begin living until he knows why he is alive. He lhen goes on to_tecognise that ,i\" o** has ever had *ny idg} of why he is atrive; so all n *n rvould experience this total *orul collapse, _th* 'nause a' ,,if they saw as clearlf as he sees. This is the nineteenth-centqrlr nihilism, the I-{. P. Lovecr aft pessirnism: we can choose truttr or life, but life depends on self-delusi6n.

ThJobjection to Sartre - as to the other writers in this chapter - is that oro oor* can 'sum up, life as being 'finally horrible'. We possess a tiny beam of consciousness that is capable of lighring up a small space around us and a certain period of time behind us. It also has a fo*** of abstract 'i,Centification, with other consciousnesses and other periods in history, hut tfris identification is a very thrg earbon copy of ;\";l u*puoience. our consciousness is seleciive. There are *ililorm of things'in the world around us; only a few of therfi get into our perceptions at any par- ticular mornent, or into our mernories\" Thereio**, b*, uirtu of mind, our attitude to existence at any given nsornent, is based upon very few 'facts' indeed \" Tf\" all the facts in Tnu universe could be simultanetusly present to one consciousness, w€ might admit that any oo***\"i, lt chose to make would be valid for our universe.

Consideration of Sartre's basic preoccupations leads one to recog- nise that all his work is nn act of protest qt the limitatioru of hurnan consciousness. In asking: 'Why am I here?' Roquentin is also asking why his consciousness is so limited that he doesn't know the answetr. But as soon,as this generalisation is accepted, it immediately hecornes plain that all art is such a protest. In sorne cases, it takes the form of an atte'mpt to rernedy this limitation - &s, say, in T7a r and, P eace ar The Cld !il'ives' Tale, which airn at hreaking the time and space bar- riers. But more frequently, it is an atternpt to create an alternative 'reality', or simply to ask why we are so liinited\" The protest rnay be overt, as in Fwust, ar irnplieC, as in Madsrne Bovary or Bouyard, et P6cuchet. Edward Upward has a story called 'sunday' in which the arche- fypal situation occurs. A bored young clerk reflects on the dullmess of Sunday (very much as fohn Osborne's characters would be doing in another twenty years): -'{ ** going back to my lodgings for lunch\" 'Who will be there?

Atl this is only to say that rnuch of the most serious literature of the twentieth century i! a complaint addressed to human destiny\" Its es- scntial feeling resernbles that of a stanza of Ornar; Ah, love! co,ald thou and I with f ate conspire To grasp this sorry scheme of things entire] x#f, T l[? :] ?:Tn J ffi |i,T *3,X3,', h e n It is worth noting that the protest of earlier poets was often directed against the violence and unpredictability of lirr*nn afrairs. Macheth complains that life is a tale told by an idiot because he feels the mean- inglessness that underlies his own destiny. If this \\Mas also Shake- speare's feelihg, then it would seem that Shakespeare was the first writer since Ecclesiastes to attempt to convince his readers of the 'valrity of human wishes' by itlustrsting them in a w,ork of art. Even as late as the r Bgo's, poets were unwilli*g to eonfess that it was bore- dom and dullness that worried them. Dowson could reconcile himself to human life by writing: tYJ,3T#T*ff ;lh'*ff:il- and rhe laushrer, It took the frankness of the twentieth century to rnake poets drop complaints of boredom into the universal Suggestions Box. Ttle romantics of the nineteenth century, when they admitted boredom, took care to suggest that it was the result of a satiety of experience.

THE ANTI-NOVEI\" It rnight seem that it would be impossible to take the novel further in the direction of the static and the subjective than Sartre has ventured. But a group of writers in postwar France has attempted to do so. Th*y are grouped together as 'anti-novelists' for obvious treasons, and the ?5"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"best-known names arnong thenn are Alain Robbe-Grillet, Nathalie Sar- raute, Michel Butor and Marguerite Duras. In the remainder of this chapter, f propose to examine briefly the work of the first two of these wtiters. II ALAIN ROBBE-GRILLET I ] . Jwg of- Alain Robbe-Griller's novels which have been published in ll, I\"glandarcTheYoyeur ard,lealousy. Both show this th6ory of iroral | , delachment' in action. Neither can be regarded as a successful novel. i. Robbe-Grillet's true precursor is Ernest Hemingway. Robbe-Crillet I is an anti-romantic, who objects to the way that most novels are over- I loaded with 'hu:n-an' overtones, saturated *ith th\" human viewpoint. ] He see'ns to feel that a novel should be like a block of factory-ma^de ice I cream,-'untouched-by h-and'. He obiects particularly to the ,pathetic I fallary'in novels, the habit of speaking ofi ,brooding sky, or a ,threat- ] enigg_landsrape'. Byl his objection is not simply -to the Love- I craft-Poe-Mary \\Mebb type of fiction. Even thl- most detached I novelist, in-describing some dramatic scene, allows the liferess objects I to reflect the emotions of the participants. A novelist describing a l. yicile may comment on a fly i:uzzrng on the windowpane, o, .f,il- I dren's voices outside, using a device of dramatic conftait. For Robbe- 1 9rillet, objects are objects - rather as in Nausea; human beings should , have no excuse for imagining that their emotions are so*6ho* ,,.o- ticed by Nature. Ilemingway had already utilised a similar technique. ln The Sun Also Rises, the hero's emotional agonies are left unstated; the external 'l world is described in ptrotographic detail. Hemingway iried to make gully; only 'the facts' are presented. So in;foday Is Friday, two Roman soldiers talk casually about the crucifixion, uhd fh\"n return to described minutely. During the journey, an American wr-un oren- tions tlat her-daughter fell in love with a Swiss, but that they ',',1 ,, couldn't allow her ; ;;*ya for.ig*r, so they took her away. The ti, girl stopped sleeping,-and iefused t6 eat; her mother is taking her a i:' cayary to try to ioniole her. This part of the,story is .thrown aiay, in ':,. a few sentences. In the final sentence, the author mcntions that he and ,.: . his wife uier_e returning to Paris to scf up separate residences. He ,' ,, seems tg lmply: 'The world is full of incredible iuisery and heartache, people fall in love and think their emotions are eyeryihing, then they 76 {oll -out of love and }iye separatetry, and the world goes oE, indifferently.' Olly the title indicates itrat the heartbreak ofl the giri seParated from her lover is the real centre of the story. In 'A 5.* Change', & girl is about to leave the man who loves her hnd to go off on a sea Yoyage with a }esbian. But rnost of the story is devoted to clescribi*g- the bar where their last meeting is taking plice, the tourists who wander in and out, the casual chitchat that flrms a background to his misery. Hemin gway, th.g, is atrso concerngd with breakin g away from the romantic way-ol telling a story\" Auden rnakes the sinne point in his poem'Mus6e de Beaux Arts': ffi H,:T#::Hf, lt-*Tff tf; :;-,H?# ft \", * Its human position; how it takes place Tflhile someone is eating or opening a window or iust walking dully along. . . . But it should be noteC that Flemingway pushed the method to its Iimits, and stitrl refused_to drop it. Th; technique of hints and under- staternents c*3 be applied CI{rly to a narrod variety of situations. There has to be sorrre powerful emotion with which the reader ca; sympathise. The technique is at its most rnoving in A Farewell to Arms where the hero, instead of describing his afrny after the death of Catherine, merely rnentions that he walf,ed UaCt to the hotel in the rain. But in Across the River and inta rhe Trees the love affair of the dyltg Colonel with a teenage girl succeeds only ln being mawkish and embarrassing, and the continual attempt at understitement strikes the reader as a confidence trick. F{e is ieminded of Roy Campbell's epigram: Ycu praise the firm restraint with which they write- I'm with you there, of course: Th*y Fse the snafle and the curb aItr right, But where's the bloody horse? This is the chief criticism to be levelled at Robbe-Grillet. F{ern- i*gyuy_is overwhelmingly successful in at least two of his novels and half a dozen short storiei, where the studied detachment of tone is Porg qoignl\"!}y effective than any amount of ernotional rhetoric. So fat, RobG-Griltet cannot boast of any compa*Ut. artistic success, The subject g! T.h_r Yoyeur seems to promise that the detached tech\"iq\"- yitl yie_ld rich results. A travellirg salesman returns to the island of his birth, where he talks to old friends and sells watches.

Did the salesman comrnit the pnurdet? eU * ambiguous. The salesrnan recapitulaler frir *o\"r- ments on the duy of the nreurder;.the reader suspects that he himself is not sure whether he is the killer. A magnificent subiect, that compares with I)tirrenmatt's Pledge. LInfortunately, Robbe-Grillet seems to have no talent wkratsoevei for building up iension. Page af ter page of flat, undistinguished prose meanders past, with lengthy descriplions o{ anything that can be measured. This, for exampl; ii a description of a buoy on the last page; 'It was a heavy iron buoy, the pdrtion above water constituting i cone surmounted by * ro*pi.x appendage of metal stems and plates\" The structure exterra.a three o, fo,r, yrrf,t into the air. The conical support itself represented nearly half this heig\\t.' And so on for another dozen lines. There is no particular significance in this buoy, except that the hero happens to bt looking at it at that moment. In a short novel, this kind-of thing occupiei about ninety per cent of the space. ' I?olousy is told through the eyes of a iealous husband who lives with his wife on a tropical banana plantation. Nothing much happens, except that the husband observes minutely ever y ait of his wife and her eyerl ge$furg. A, act like the killing \"o,f a centipede by the 'other man' is described microscopically\" The bJok begins *rra ends *ith- precise physical descriptions. As in Herningway the reader's rnind is supposed to be full of the agony of the jealous trusband, which is mrade more intense by its isolation frbm the surrounding objects and emotional overtones. There is supposed to be an effect like that of those 'three dimensional' photogriphs one can buy, that one looks at through a pair of red and green glaises, The emotion stands out in the f_oreground, naked and clear, and the background is separated fronn the foreground by a clear gap. Objects are indifferent] cold; rnan's agony is therefore all the more tragic because it is a self-enclosed circuit, burning itself out. The effect is not rlew. |oyce uses it in the pPening scene _of Ulysscs, where Stephen's agony of conscience about lit dying mother is contrasted with the sunlighi on the sea and Buck Mulligqq's cheerful obscetity. Granville-Barker uses it in the opening scene of The Secret Life, where the music of \\Tagner's Tris tan-is con- trasted with the cynical or practical attitudcs of t[e 'men of the world' who have just taken part in an amateur performance. But Hem- ingway, |oyce and Granville-Barker cornmunicate with the reader; their detachment covers an emotion that needs no rhetoric for its communication. It woulcl seem that, .so far, Robbe-Grillet has not yet found himself a subject that, told with scientific precision, will *ik. its own impact of pity or horror on the reader. But even supposing 7B that Robbe-Grillet finds this ideal subiect, it still remains a nnatter for gonjec-ture bg* IopB it wiltr be before; hke F{erningway and }oyce, he finds himself. at the end of his arCstic tether, pushed to an absurd cxtreme by his adherence ta a technique. Fconoxr\"ly and precision are undoubtedly of irnmense innportance to the artist\" But it is significant that the greatest achievernents in ttre field of the novel hive been created by writers who were not afraid to produce 'fluid puddings' (Henry fames's contemptuous epithet for the War am,d Peaie type;f lo1el). Dickentl Fulfac, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, hfanil, Kazantzaliis, [. C. Powys, are all highly unsatisfying as craftsmen; one never ceases to wish that they_possesseC |oyce's fierce preoccupation with teckrnigue, |ames's scientific intellect, Flemingway's detachrnen t. tsut their siap- clash technique always expressed what they meant, even if it often expressed rnore than they meant. \"Where novelists aye concerned, it would seern that we have to choose between diarrhoea and con- stipation, except in the very greatest works, But one thing is certainl no anlount of technique can ever forrn a substitute for havi:rg sor&e- thing to say. NATFIAI.IE SARR,AUTE The first irnpression gained on reading Nathalie Sarraute's two novels Tro_pisnLes and Portrait af a Man [Jnhnawm. is of a conglomeration of influences - Henry |ames, Proust, Sartre, even, at times, the eartry T\" S. Eliot\" tsut to say this is to be unfair to lvIlte Sarraute, who is a sensitive and original writer. The chief comptraint one can rnake against her - and her fellow anti-novelists is that it is a pity she was never infiuenced by E1iot's essay on Marie Lloyd, in whickr Eliot ernphasises the importance of the artists keeping in touch with the ;general public'. It is true that she neyer writes for effect, or to impress her highbrow readers; there is never obscurity for its o\\r/n sake, But the involerted complexities o{ her novels make the later Henry }ames seern straightforward\" Sartre has written of her: If we take a lsok, as the author invites us to do, at what goes on inside people, \\Me glirnpse a mciling of flabby, many-tentacled evasions; evasion through obiects which peacefully reflect the universal and the permanent; evasion through daily occupations; evasion through pettiness. I know of few rnore ilnpressive passages than the one which shows us 'the old man' winning a narrow victory over the spectre of death by hurrying, bare-footed and in his nightshirt, ts the kitchen in order to make sure whether or not his claughter has stolen som.e soap. 79"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Her work, Sartre suggests, is deliberately about the 'inauthentic', a picfure of human beings as trivial, frightened ghosts: in short, salauds. But this faitrs to give an impression of the pathological nature of her writing. Pafirait af a MqrL Unhnown reads like extracts from a psy- chiatrist's casebook deaiing with an oversensitive neurotic who is about to develop delusions and persecution mania. The sensitivity to fine shades of emotion in the late |ames has here become an agonised awareness of every single strand of feeling in each human relation. It is as if an adolescent boy wrote with complete honesty about his rniseries and ernbarras$ments in all his everyday dealings, and as- surned that everybody in the world was as concentrated on their own feelings as he is. Cne is rerninded continually of cases that \\(illiarn ]ames cites in that chapter of The V arieties of Religious Experience called 'The Sick Soul'.

Its near-paranoiac character can be seen in a typical passage trike the fotlowing:- Now the conversation had a different sound for rne; it had lost its appar- ently banal, harrnless aspect, aud I sensed that certain words that yrere being spoken gave on to vast craters, immense pfecipices, visible only to initiates, who were leaningn tresfraining themselves \" . \" I was leaning with them, re- straining myself, trembling and attracted as they \\rrere * over the abyss. This is part of a description of an ordinary conversation over a meal. It is interesting to note its affinity - in mood - with Lovecr aftt the concealed horror of existence. And it is characteristic of her rnethod: to look at every grain af. a human relationship under a micro- scope, until the most harmless fragrnent is seen, like a piece of cheese, to be swarnli*g with wormlike grubs. Trr-is frequently has the same effect as the microscope of Proust or |ames; to quicken the reader's insight and deepen his sense of the irnplications of a situation. But it also goes over continually into the abnormal, and one becomes aware that, in magnifying her awareness, she has forfeited the ordinary, vital response to existence that is the basis of good writing. She seems to know this. After describing a public square with 'wan little gravel plots' (Robbe-Grillet would hardly approve of the adjective) and 'a hedge 'like the fringe of beard that \" . . grows so thickly on corpses', she adrnits that this is not far fuom a casc in a psychi atyic handbook where the patient believes evcrything to be deacl. She goes on to invent a passage that might bc a parody of Craham Greene: Everywhere you go, you feel clcad chiklhoods. No childhood rnernories here. Nobody has any\" They fade and die as soon as they form. They never seem to 8o succeed in getting a Srip on these pavements, or on these lifeless housefronts; And the p6ople,-thJ women and the old men, sitting motlonless on the benches, in the }ittle plots, look as if they were in a state of decomposition' Elsewhere in the book, she seems to be deseribing hersetrf: i' I know that she needs so Iittle, the nnerest nothing makes her fremble, this Hypersensitive, lined with quivering little silken tentacles that sway at the slightest breath . , . Like dogs sniffing along a wall at suspicious odors they alone recognise, with her nsse to the ground, she plcks up the scent of the things people are asharned of; she sniffs at implied meanings, foilows through the traces of hidden humiliations, unabtre to break away fror:n thern. In Mlle Sarraute can be seen most clearly the obiection to the in- creasing preoccupation with technique; her fish are not merely gasp ing on the strand; they are dangerously close to disintegrating altogether. Mlle Sarraute has this in common with Robbe-Grillet: she is the latest development of the school that beXieves that the purpose of literature is to represent reality rnore minutely than ever before (in Robbe-Grillet, objective reality; in Mlle Sarraute, psychological re- ality)\" But this is to forget that literature must also have a coilnponent of movement, of gusto. In MIle Sarraute's case, there is the posslbillty of development in another direction. Ftrer Portrait af slvlawUnhnawnhas close affinities with Eliot's Prufrock and 'Portrait of a [ady'. The young man in the latter poem has iust this kind of overawareness of every shade in a relationship, and the same ear for banal conversation\" After some clanging piece of sententior:sness, his 'smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac', 0r; I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark Suddenly, his expression in a glass. My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark. But it is not a long step frorn satirising 'inauthenticity' to denouncing it, as iwTheWaste Land, and then to searching for authenticity, as in Ash-Wednesday and the Four Quartets. N{lle Sarraute's way is less of an obvious dead end than that of most of the writers dealt with in this chapter. At least the static quality of her writing does not spring frorn a sense of futility, or a misguided atternpt at total objectivity."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"NOTES r.

Three The Implications of Total Pessimism Even for a reader who knows his modern literature, it is difificult to explain how the novel carne to a halt in the present cul-de-sac. 'The evolution of realism' is not a convincing explanation. Are Tolstoy and Balzac so much less 'advanced' in realilm fhur, |oyce and Robbe-Gril- let? Does the evolution of technique really deinind a complete sus- pensiCIn of plot? The idea is absurd. The novels of C. P\" Sn6w are as 'true to life'as Mlle Sarraute's and as full of psychotrogical delicac/, and yet !h*y have a greatdeal of 'plot'\" Plainly, the_ avant-garde writers have sornehow perforrned a neat coniuring _trick. They profess to be completely uninterested in ideas, and yet their whole technique is dictated -by a pessimistic 'Wetr- tanschauung. This proposition is easier to follow if one considers the work of Greene, \\[augh, Sartre and Faulkner. These writers have one feature in commori: {l represent the world as an appalling place, and all mcceed in ending on a note of uplift by declaring their faith in some absfract idea (catholicism, 'engagement', rCIrnantic stoicism). For readers urho may be neither Catholics, Communists nor Southerners, these solutions will appear to be'either limitedly true, or downright nonsense, and the authors convicted of a greater or lesser degree of self-deception. It is interes$rg to compare the writers in the previous chapter with two writers who have had the courage to declare for a totatr ind unre- lieved pessimism, with no claim to *Jrtistic detachment' or even to an uplifting stoicisrn. Jhe first of these, Leonid Andreyev, was nevetr popular in England, and is today almost totally forgotten\" LEONID ANDREYEV The hest book on Andreyev is Gorki's short study\" From this and the {g* bioglaphical facts that are available in English (particularly in A. Kaun's thesis on Andreyev), his life and personality can be- pieced together. Born in OreI in r87r, of middle-class parents, he suffered from the youthful romanticism that was so common in the nineteenth 8z 83"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"century. He studied law at St Petersburg and Moscow and wrote short stories. The rejection of kris first story made him attempt suicide, in a way that had sornething in common with Russian roulette. Certain trains had low furnaces that alrnost touched the tracks; Andreyev lry down between the raiLs, willing to accept an unpleasant death if lhis type of train was the first to pass. trt was not; a train with a high furnace passed over him, leaving him untouched\" Ftrowever, he later shot himself near the heart with a revolver; the bullet missed his heart, but caused the permanent heart complaint from which he died at the age of forty-eight. FIis third suicide atternpt occurred at a gay student party, when Andreyev suddenly stabbed himself with a knife; agarn, the wound was not serious. He also shot himself through the hand om another occasion, and Gorki records that the hand was twisted permanentXy. Gorkl, who \\Mas already a well-kn-own yollng writer in 1898 when he read Andreyev's first story in a Moscos/ newspaper, wrote to the author, and later arranged to meet him at a railway station\" The meet- ing \\Mas brief but warm; Gorki records the friendliness of Andreyev's personality, and his impulsive rrords: 'Let us be close friends.' Cne of their earliest conversations was about suicide and lying uncler trains. (Gorki had often played this game for a dare as a child.) \\fiithin a few years, Andreyev had become the most famous and popular writer in Russia, surpassing even Gorki. Nou, they were on more equal terms, their friendship could develop with less restraint on Andreyev's side\" To the English ear, solne of Gorki's descriptions make it sound as if a homosexual relationship existed between them, An- dreyev often kissing Gorki passion ately, or even embracing his knees and wetting them with tears. (This is most unXikely\") Their characters were completely opposed\" Gorki was the son of poor parents who had educated himsem tate in life, who had trampea fro* end to end of Russia and seen all kinds of rniseries, which he described in his early short stories. Tolstoy once told Gorki that he liked him because he was so good-natured, although he had every right to be vindictive. Gorki was easygoing, good-tempered, totally honest, an avid reader, and a romantic who took no deep interest in the physical side of sex. An- dreyev, although he had often starved as a student, was 'middle class'. He loathed culture and never read more than he had to. He was a heavy and gloomy drinker, who easily bccame drunk. (H. attributed this to the fact that his father was a dipsornaniac.) rThe flesh'fasci- nated him in the same morbid way it ffid fascinated Baudelaire and Wilde, and he took perverse pleasure in sexual orgies with unclean .prostitutes. Physicullt they were also opposites, Corki being strongly t built, with his heavy, almost comic face, with its large nose and droop- ing moustache, while Andreyev was physically delicate, with a neat, pointed black beard and small, handsome features. In spite of Andreyev's alcoholism and rnonbidity, Gorki ernphasises that he was a delightful companion, continuously witty, as enthusi- astic and affectionate as a child, Celighted with his own ability to express ideas concisely and imaginatively. On one occasion, when Gorki was pleased with tris friend's neat summarising of a certain type of woman, Andreyev beamed like a schoolboy, and began to boast naively about his poWer over words. These two extremes of Andreyev's character should be understood in order to gain a faiv picture of his achievement. He was in no way a fully integrated personality. His harshest critics have always failed to realise this. Tolstoy said conternptuously: nAndreyev says Boo, but I am not frightened.' \\7hen kris stories 'Abyss' and 'In the Fog' caused such a storm of hysteria, and all kinds of libels appeared on him in the Russian press (usually asserting that he was a sexual degenerate) he went frantic with worry, and had to be dissuaded from courting further misunderstandings by writing letters of protest to all the newspapers. F{is enemies regarded him as a mature and rnalignant Satan wh.en he was actually a kind of brilliant, bewildered schoolboy, craving affection. His success erected further barriers of envy, A stronger personality might have gone its own way, developing is an artist and thinker. But the inherited morbidity of Andreyev's con- stitution could not bear the strain; there was no basic resilience, no fundamental hunger for life that would always triurnph oyer the doubts. The rnore one studies Andrey€v, the more inescapable becornes the conclusion that he would have been a great writer if his constitution had not betrayed hirn. As it is, Andreyev is always the brilliant schoolhoy. Gorki's ac- counts of his conversation show his ability to throw off ideas at con- siderable speed, and to quickly dramatise them into stories or plays. These ideas are never reilly piofound, but they are always connecied with religious and philosophical issues. For example, Andreyev threw off a suggestion for a story about a man who wants to test the stupid- ity of believers; he practises asceticism and becomes a saint with thou- sands of disciples, to whom he preaches his own doctrines; then one duy he announces to his disciples that it is all nonsense. Unable to live without their belief, they kitl him and go on believing.t Moreover, Andreyev was quite capable of writing such a story overnight, and But even more typical of Andreyev's imagination is the following 84 B5"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"anecdote. Gorki told Andreyev of how a revolutionary cornrade_had taken refuge in a brothel, hunted by the potrice. A prostitute realised this, and syrn pathised with hirn. The revolu\"tionary, being soroethils of a puritan, reiected her advances, whereupon, losing her ternper, {h* slapped his face. The revolutionary had the good sense to recognise his own priggishness, and apologised to her, whereup_on they b-ecalne friends. Andreyev wrote tlris idea into the story 'Dalkness' in which a puritanical revolutionary flees into a brothel. But the key }ine of the itroy occurs when the prostitute screams at, hirn, '\\fhat riSht $ave you to be good when I;m bad?' This, for Andleye-v, waf- the whole point of an6ther of his ironic stories about the fi-rtility of human life ind the irnpossihitrity of cornrnunication. Gorki recounts -this anecdote with disapproval, iaaing that he thinks the original story more rnoving than Andreyev's clistortion of it. It is diflncult to say whether Andreyev should be regarded ry a revolutionary or as anti-revolutionary. Like so- many H,,ussian intellec- tuals at the iime of the abortive revolution, he served somre time in prison for lending his flat to revolutionaries as a rneeting place. F[e iater wrote the most moving testirnony of all to the bravery of revo- lutionary comrades in 'The Seven \\ilho \\[ere F{anged'. And yet the pessirnism of his work is the opposite of the revolutionary spirit\" ^ From the biographical point bf view, Gorki's rnost interest-i*S_ chap; ter describes how Andreyev spolce CIne dry at length on the futility of thought. Their opposed views are an inteiesting epitome o{ one of the thes# of this book - the two views of imagination. Gorki took the Shavian view that thought is all hurnan power, the imagination a searchlight on the future, that even in its failure to solve ultirnate questioris, thought is noble. Andreyev held that all thought it antil life, all imaginltioo, a consolation against the horror of life, 'True wisdom is 61*, but all great rnen suffer torments,' Andreygv de- clared., stating the Dostoevskian position. After a quarrel, during which Andreiu, admitted that theie were times when he hated Gorki, they went out into the yel}ow f*g of St ?eters!r*g, drank in a caf6, urrd went home with soilre prostitutes. Gorki then describes a scene ihat might have come out of Andreyev, or Kuprin's Yanna, the Pit', when o** of the women stripped and danced drunkenly on the table, while Andreyey tatked about the hopelessness of life' Fryrally, An- dr*y*u went into the Iledroorn with one of the wonnen. Gorki seems to have abstained. Andreyev encled by plucking all the feathers of the prostitute's hat (for which she prornptly rnade lri* pay) aqd_insisting tt rt one of the wornen acconrpany him on a drive around St Peters- burg. Gorki finally got rid of tfie woman while Andreyev slipped into ,86 a drunken sleep, and took his friend back horne. But as soon as Gorki had gone, Andreyev went out again, and went on drinking for three days, after which he left for Moscow\" The picture of Andreyev's ioyless debauchery is of exceptional power. ' The chief evenis of Andreyev's life can be summarised briefly. Ee became farnous at the turn of the century, at the age of thirty. He married his first wife in Lgaz, a meek, attractive girl narned Alex- andra, on whorn he became completely dependent, clinging to _her like a child, demanding that her life should be completely pivoted on his own, obiecting if she eyen wanted to leave him to go ilto St Petersburg. Wtr.n rhe died in r 9o6, he was cornpletely shattered, and confirrnedin his pessimism. He married again in r 9o7, this time a girl named Anna Denisevitch, and clung to her with the same childlike tenacity. Friends who saw her ro*e time after their marriage could hardty recognise her because the former heauty had be-comg so_ hug- gard ind worrr. I.{evertheless, she managed to outlive her husband. Andreyev moved to a house of fantastic architecture at Kuokkala in Finlanh, where he spent the rest of his life. He continued to drink heavily, to travel, and to waste time on such fads as painting. Because of the heart aihnent, his health was never strong, and the impact of. a bomb near his home brought on the final heart disease. He hated the Russian revolution of r gL7, and edited a rcactionary newspaper from 1914, onward. He died an enemy of the Soviets, and his work is very rnuch out of favour in contemporary Russia, although occasional stories are printed\" Andrey&'s literary quality is very uneven indeed. His early stories are gently gloomy, ir the Tchekhovian manner. They might all be said\"to dlrive from Tchekhov's story oHeartache' in-which an old cabman tries to tell his passengers about the recent death of his son; but no one is interested, and he is at last forced to tatrk to his horse. One of Andreyev's least unpleasant stories, 'Vania', tells of. a small boy who has been brought up by an aunt and uncle. His mother, who. had been deserted hy her huiband, decides that she wants custody of the child and, after a legal battle, finally succeeds\" The aunt and uncle are shattered, and Vania is unsatisfied. He loved his aunt, and his mottrrer seems false and hysterical. At the end of the story, he is taken to the srnall, untidy room where he will now live with his mother, and she shows trim sorne toys. Vania is indifferent to toys - he prefers reading - and shows it. His rnother flings herself on the bed and bursts into tears. Vania strokes her hair, tells her that. he will love her, and , offers to read her a story about a water nymph\" This story is the exteption.

Andreyev's theme is here more universal than in ']udas', and B. G. Guerniy is right to compare the story with anatole France's 'Procu- rator of |udea'. But the comparison brings out Andreyev's ignorance of the period. An enemy of culture, he is not at his best in historical fiction. 'Lazarus' is probably the most pessimistic story Andreyev ever wrote, the essence of his nihilisrn. It tells how, when Lazarus came back from the dead, he had seen some vision that made him aware of the total futility of human life. Anyone who looked into his eyes was seized by the same conviction. A famous Roman sculptor comes to see him, and goes away and carves a monstrous black shape, under which rests a beautifully chiselled butterffy. One of his friends smashes the black shape, leaving only the butteifly. But when his friends talk at length about beauty, he retorts: 'All that is a lie.'Finally, the emperor Augustus surrmons Lazanrs because he wishes to accept the challenge of looking into his eyes. He also comes to feel that life is futile, but decides he must overcome his distaste for the sake of his people. He haslazavus blinded, and Lazarus ends his life sitting or, ,^ro&, star- ing sightlessly in front of him. Trre bibticil trilogy brings to mind oscar \\Milde. There is the same fake biblical language as in'W'ilde's prose poems ('And it came to pass ...' etc.). Moreover, one has only to consider the anecdotes that An- dreyev produced in such abundance in conversation with Gorki to realise that, like 'Wilde, he tended to ruin his original inspiration by overelaboration. There is the same romantic pessimism as in \\trild6, expressed in 'Wilde's anecdote about Christ. Christ walks through a city, and rep-rove_s a {runk, who replies: 'I was a leper once; you healed me. \\Uhat else should I do?' He then reproves a man who follows a prostitute, and the man replies that he was blind once and that Christ had healed him; finally, he sees an old man weeping, and when he asks why he weeps, the old man replies: 'I was dead, you brought me back to life.'\\Vhat should I do but weep?' Like \\7ilde, Andreyev is fond of talking in hushed whispers about the sins of the flesh. 'Let there be a feast of the flesh,'he exclaimed to Gorki. He romanticises prostitutes, and would no doubt have admired \\[ilde's poem about the harlot's house. Moreover, as Gorki points out, Andreyev's nihilism did not extend to his own affairs; he was hungry for fame and praise. The need to make an impression is more important to him than the honest expression of his feelings. Andreyev's writing life was barely twenty years long, and the last ten were a continual decline. His work became more'symbolic'and in , t;l ' :;. il . rll . ., :il ,:i .::, ( 9r melodramatic: 'For a single instant, flaming horror lighted up his rnind, opening before him a black abyss. And the black abyss swal- lowed him.' But Andreyev's point is well made, and relates him to 'W'edekind and Maupassant: man is unconscious of the power of the sexual instinct, which is more dangerous than a bomb. As a famous writer, Andreyev felt the need to play the prophet of nihilism. He was also jealous of the success of Artzybasheff. His stories became steadily more symbolic. The impossibility of human communication dominates them. In'The Life', a man suspects that his misfress is deceiving him, and kills her with a knife; having killed her, he realises that he wilt now never know the truth, that he has immor- talised the lie. (Andreyev may have been influenced here by the death scene of M6lisande in Maeterlinck's play.) In 'Silence', the neurotic daughter of a priest commits suicide after refusing to explain_ what is tormenting her, then the priest's wife becornes paralysed, and cannot reply when he begs her to forgive him. In 'Laughter', a young man who ls unhappily in love puts on a {.ancy dress costume of a Chinese noble, toget[er with a mask whose complete wooden immobility makes everyone laugh.'When the young man pours out his misery to a girl at the partf ,she listens seriously while her eyes are turned away from him, but bursts into helpless laughter when she looks at him. There is something faked about these stories; Andreyev is_loading the dice. Admittedly, his mask is only a symbol of the immobiliry of human flesh, with its inability to express the suffering of the mind; but the story still rings hollow. Tolstoy is right; Andreyev is now shouting Boo, not writing out of some inner need. In hii biblical trilogy, '|udas Iscariot', 'Lazatrts' and 'Ben-Tobith', the interest in.religion is only superficial.']udas'is another of An- dreyev's intellectuil handstands, like the story_ of the man who becLmes a saint to test the stupidify of believers. He is interested only in asking whether it is not posiible that |udas wanted to help Christ_to live out his destiny as the crucified man-god, and did so in spite of the label of traitor that his act would bring. ]uclas, in short, might have displayed an altogether unusual degree of self-sacrifice, and mig-ht be the grlatest of the apostles. Again, Andreyev seerns to be out to dazzle his idmirers and confound his enemies by turning all 'values' upside down. But over fifty years after its publication, all its shock value has disappeared, and it seems merely a period picce. 'Ben-Tobith'is briefer and more straightforward; it tells how a man called Ben-Tobith had an appalling toothache on the day of the crucifixion, and the story is told frorn the vicwpoint of Ben-Tobith's toothache; the execution of a cranky |ewish prophet is iust another 9o"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"i every way poorer. A story called'The'Wall'reveals all the worst and most theatrical elements in Andreyev taking charge. It is wholly sym- bolic, told by a leper who stands it the fooi of af immense wall that extends as far as the horizon. For several pages Andreyev describes the mis_ery and apathy of the other people *h6 ar. with hi-; some of them play pointless games, and ignore i man who is starving to death 3 few feet away. There ge leggn$s of an old hermit who m\"anaged to burrow a hole in_the wall (symbolising the saints or mystics) anjsome of them jpend their lives looki\"g f_oJ this myrhical'hole. They try various devices to get over the wall, but withotit success. Finally, :rtg.-d 9o-by the narrator, waves of people rush at the wall to try io break it down, but many are crush.a to death. The narrator tries to persuade them to keep charging the wall, because every additional Pgay is-a-s-t-eppingstone towardJthe top of the wall, but they ignore him and fall into apathy again. . Tt. story recalls |ames Thompson's 'city of Dreadful Night', and it is ultimately just as unc_onvincing. It makei no attempt to aigue a case that life is futile - as Schopenhauer does; it simply stites it. -No doubt the 'waste land' vision is deeper than the ordinaiy acceptance of life that Andreyev attacked in his earlier stories. But it is stlll a halfway house. A man who ge-nuinely possesses it is tormented by it; it drives him to keep looking for the 'h-ole in the wall'. The soluiions are not always the s-ame; they may difier as widely as Nietzsche,s pessimistic vitalism and Eliot's acceptan_ce of Anglo-Catholic Christiinity. But there is nosign in Aldreyev that he made any effort to get beyond the 'y.rLtr land'stage. His later works might be described aicomplacently nihilistic. There are fwo exceptions that should be mentioned, and they are arguably among A_tdreye_v's fi_ne1t works. These are the story\"The Seven \\fho '!v'ere Hanged' and the play Anathema, written rtspect- ively in r9o8 and r9o9. The story deils with the last days of five youlg- revolutioaaries and two murderers. It is, for the most part, a careful study- of the seyen condemned, showing their different aiti- tudes to death. As-uzual,-Andreyev reveals himself to be a psycho logist-of_considerable depth. All the revolutionaries go to theii dLaths cheerfully, and the two women are the bravest umorig them. The two murderers are cowards in the face of death. The final-scene, when the bodies are cut down in the snow and sent back to the prison, is strangely moving_. 4r , work of art, it is perhaps Andreyivfs most undeniable tour de force.Its content is a different matter. Although all seven refuse the consolations of a priest at the end, Andr.y\"., implies that their souls are now in heaven. Moreover, it is impossible 92 to believe that Andreyev was really convinced that his revolutionaries i were somehow worthwhile; his outlook in his other work argues again-st it. It seems more_probable that he wrote the story as a bid for popularity with the revolutionary movement,which had 6egun to con- dgmn him as a pessimistic reactionary. His extreme sensitivlty to criti- cism and to fluctuations in his own fame adds credibility to ihis view. Anathema is Andreyev's version of the Book of ]ob. Anathema is the devil, who asks the Guardian of the Gates of Eternity to show him the answer to the problem -of existence, so that he can help *rrrt i\"a. Vhen he is refused, th_e devil goes down to earth and iroceeds to tempt ,o ol4 |ew, David Leiter, -who is dying of starvation in a Rus- sian town. Th: |ew cannot be tempted. The divil urges a mob to stone him to death. Later, the devil askJthe Guardian of tie Gates whether David's death does not demonstrate the futility of life and the failure of love and virtue. The Guardian answers that the devil will never succeed in understanding the purpose of goodness and life. The devil replies with defiance and curseJ. It would lgem as though Andreyev has here changed his whole vlgwpoint, if he is on the side of David Leiter and the Euardian.

The same old defeatism was dressed up in different clothes. However, it would be a mistake to dismiss Andreyev as an insincere pessimist. Gorki's memoir alone refutes this. The early works are the outcome of -a genuine moral ferment; they bubble wiih life. The tra- ,g:dy of Andreyev the artist was that he ceised to pay attention to life; his later works are all mathematical propositions,^devoted to asserting his nonsensical theme, that life *amot worth living. I use the worl nonsensical because the demonstratiorx were ail fa[ed; if life is not worth living, then stories are certainly not worth writing. A large part of Andreyev remained undeveloped: an afiectioirate, overseirsiiive adolescent with a longing for fame and public approval, and a ten- 9:\".y t9_b9-dgeply hurt by misund_erstanding. He made no attempt to 'live with' his pcssimism; like Schopenhauer, he enjoyed the ^good qhings of life. rnTheDay of wrqth,hl could even wriie an overbl\"own dithyramb on freedom. Andreyev is almost a Dostoevsky character, and he demonstrates the truth of Aldous Huxley's ,.*rik that Dos- toevsky's characters are fundamentally unreal. They may seem to be working models for real people, but if they were ever trinslated into reality, it would soon become apparent that there is something wrong with their clockwork. The inventor has done a little fakin\"g some- yF.rg, and disguised some human weakness as metaphysicaiagony. This is not difficult-to do. Andreyev advertised himseli ai the geiuine Dostoevskian article, the metaphysical man, Stawogin mad\"e flesh, intent only on his vision of the pointlessness of life. frrh.r, *. .*r*- ine him, we discover that the melapfrysical angst is partly hurt vanity and partly toothache. And yet he ii by no meins wholly a fake. Given a stronger constitution, a more searching temper, he could easily have b-een greater than Dostoevsky. The temperairent was there but not the sfrength, the perceptiorr but not the will. He remains perhaps the most interesting artistic failure of our century. SAMUEL BECKETT I can think of only one_other_writer who has accepted the implications oj Pessimism as stoically and logically as Andreyev: Samuei Beckett. A comparis_on of the two provides some intcresting observations, for Andreyev_thought of himself as post-Dostoevsky, ihil. Beckett obvi- -orrly ttp\\r of h_imself as-post-)oyce and Kafka.-Considering the simi- larity of their 'weltanscharrurg, the difference in their \"method is astonishing. A knowledge of the relation of Andreyev's pessimism to 94 his.literary creation also provides some fascinating insights into Beckett. Beckett's work has gone farther than that of any other con- tremporary in the direction of 'static' experimentalism. lle has taken t}g prot.st-about human boredom and-misery to a point where it deleals its-obiect - to communicate the protest io other people. Beckett's work has often been compaied to |oyce's - ihr .orrnection may have _been suggested by ^ myth that Bickett was once ]oyce,s secretary. Such a c-omparison is nonsensical. The only similiriiy is that both are Dubliners. |oy-ce was- preoccupied with languige; Beckett's sense of language is about as lively ,s Hrrrrrd. ulyssTs fas br-.1joTpargd to aaty, open it at almost any place and the reader will find unfamiliar alleyways, vistas he never iroticed before. Any page of Beckett reads prgtfy much like any other page of Beckett. Nor does there seem to have been any development in fiiJui.* of life. If all his works except one were destroyed in i hoiocaust, it would make no differ-ence; arly one is completely iepresentative. -'!7hat exactly has Beckett to say? InEndgame, oneof the characters tells a story that seemt typical. A man goes to a tailor f.or a pair of trousers, but the tailor keeps delaying, suying first that he has spoiled the seat, then that the crotch is giving trouble. Finally, in a fury, the man shouts: 'rn six days God made the world. And yo,r,r, not capable o{ making me a pair of frousers in three months., Th. trilo, ,.iriio 'But my_dear sir, look at the world, and then look at my trousers.i It is the old Omar Khayyim complaint. Beckett's work- has its irecedents - notably certain stories of Jchekhov's, such as 'Goussiiy', which might have served as a model for all Beckett's novels and piays. It begini 'It was ,lr.rJy arrio ,\"t yoqld soon be light. Goussiev, a privat-e ... raised himseff a titite in his hammock and said in a whisper: \"Do you hear, pavel Ivanitch?

There is, it would seem, a fundamental fallacy in Beckett,s work. It { possible to create good literature with a defeatist theme - as An- *ry.y sometimes did; it is even possible to advocate suicide - as Artzybasheff_ did rn The Breahing point. It is possible to write at considerable length about someone dying - as iolstoy did in lyan' Ilyich, But to write about dreariness deminds that one should offer a counter-attraction - as Zola well realised when he spiced his work so heavily with sex. Beckett accidentally brought oli the right .o*- bination in Godot. Bur apparently h_e-decidef h. *rr betriyinj his own pessimism by sugaring the pill. His later works make orr. tlirt of a man trfng to write a symphony using only one note. , The main objection to his work is its unoriginaliry. It might have been concocted from a mixture of Eliot and kafka, with ,\"drrh of ]oyceJufrering and bewilderment must be expressed dynamically - T by'\\TiHred owen in such war poems as'Futility'and'rt*posure,lln its context, owen's agonised cry;what are we d6ing here?i expresses volumes of Beckett. CONCLUSION The fallacy that has reached a kind of limit in Beckett is also the fallary underlying o_ur notion of science and philosophy; it is the idea that man's only task is to survey the univerie, to look outward. Cer- tain -rodern philosophe-1s (Rulssll, for example) give the impression that they believe that all they have to do is tb sit in ,t, rr-.f,air and consider the 'facts'; that -the pgrcgiving mind and the logical faculty can be relied on completely to deal with those facts and.6*e up witfr an answer. There is, of course, an opposite fallary: Nietzche,s-cry of 'Ignore the philosophy and look at the philosopher'. Neither is true. The mind and perceptions are partly reliible; but no philosopher has a l [, rd fr Tf. lt' !; I l-i ,l ti ffl # b t right to think of himseU as a pure reasoning force (unless his field is mathematics). The right state of mind for a philosopher is an active looking-both-ways, outward and inward simultaneously. It is not eaough to be a Pascal, preoccupied only with his own shortcomings, or a Russell whose good sense is often marred by u smirk of self- congratulation. In literature, the trouble is less easy to define. The'Shakespearean fish' tried to portray the world objectively, to represent it as it might seem to any man. The romantics became more personal and spoke boldly of the world as it seemed to them, This has led eventually to a kind of self-conceit; the artist sits in his armchair and writes about his vision of the world as if he is delivering the gospel. He also takes himself for granted, like the philosopher. He is inclined to offer his , temperamental reactr.ons to life as if they were the result of a most careful weighing up of the whole universe. fn the Edward Upward story'sunday', the central character finally has a kind of vision of the purpose of history that leads him to decide to engage in left-wing political action. In this vra]r the intuitions that were bewildered by the boredom of .a Sunday afternoon reach out beyond the boredom, out into a world in which they can discover meanings. Hesse's Step penwolf has a similar vision of the purpose of his own life after a boring day: 'A refreshing laughter rose in rlre . . . The golden trail was blazed, and I was reminded of the eternal, and of Mozart and the stars.' 'What appeared to be a blank wall of meaninglessness proves to be l not really a wall. But it does so only because the artist's intuitions and rl emotions keep thrusting out and trying to grasp something, trying to break through the incomprehension. The artist has to recognise him- ' seH not merely as being able to see the world, but as also being able to alter his perception of. it. Both Beckett and Russell are fixed in the static fallaey, accepting the original form of the perceptions.In closely related ways, they fail to grasp that man has a will to perceite as well as perceptions, and that the perceptions can be adiusted like the range on a telescope. It is the static fallacy that has led to the'fish gasping on the strand'. The realist vision began with Balzac andZola, and was an attempt to give 'reality'its due, instead of using it merely as a backcloth against which stories took place. After the coming of |oyce,'reality'began to demand more and more of the stage, although - as can be seen in loyce - it cramped the ttor/. The realist vision becomes more and more microscopic, more concerned with technigues and 'ways of seeing'.

WELLS This is worth analysing at some length; its connection with 'the prob- lo2 'i .* fl c' ro3"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":". i,: .. as a religious imperative or simply ,, \" ,.inonsibility to civilised society. In either case, it is a meaning imposed from outside. He can now, as it were, impose his own meanings on life. It is at this point that his conduct answers the tacit question: 'What is life really worth? 'What can be got out of life by a man with no material worries and no obligations to fulfil? Oie type of answer to the question is given by Charles Lamb in his essay about the Superannuated man. His old clerk, who is finllly r-e- tired on a pension and exults in his freedom, declares: 'Man, I verily believe, is out of his element as long as he is operative. I am altogether for the ltfie contemplative.' Freedom, for him, means pottering around the bookshops, walking around public gardens, watching the 'poor drudges' on their way to work. But here. the old clerk's notion of freedom halts. There is no mention of strange intuitions of 'other modes of being', of mystical ecstasies as he stares at an ear of corn, nothing that '!?'ordsworth or Traherne or Blake would consider the essence of freedom Unless a man is a poet or a mystic, his notion of the'value of life'is bound to be defined in terms of certain material symbols. Hence we have people committing suicide when they read in the newsPaPers about a new hydrogen bomb test, threatened inflation, a rise in the rate of sex crime. Their lives are like a grocer's scales; on one side is a certain number of weights, on the other a bag of sugar; if another spoonful of sugar is added, the weights rise. Life has ceased to be worth living; there is more pain than pleasure. In a sense, this is inevitible. Each human consciousness is limited; it cannot contain everything in the universe and weigh ,rp every single factor before it decides about the value of life. But here lies the value of the artist. He protests, in effect, that the value of life always exceeds any possible misery or discomfort. He attempts to keep open the door totfie irrational, to the powers of affirmation. In order to live and act, human beings must make certain makeshift iudgments on life. A youth who has just left school and is thinking ab-ogt a caleer may \\Mant an answer to the question: ''What arc my fullest poten- tia[ities?' But he does not postpone finding a job until he has answered the question. He has to make the best choice between available alternatives. And his choice constitutes a kind of fudgment on the value of life; he will continue to act in a way that implies such irrdg- ments all his life. The poet is attempting to remind us all the time that such iudgments ate mikeshift, that they leave out of account most of the universe. '!7hen W'ells declares that he wishes to go on living only if 'Iifel ro4 means pure mental activity, he is declaring, in effect, that from now on he will no longer regard makeshift judgments on life as having any meaning or validiry. Self-enioyment is synonymous with purposeful evolutionary activity of the intellect and the senses; and the notion of a living creature, capable of absolute seH-enjoyment is the notion of a man-god, no longer plagued by tiresome necessities over which he has no control. Vhen a man commits himself to this definition of mean- ing, the 'value of life' ceases to be a matter of material symbols, com- parable to abag of sugar on the grocer's scales, and therefore limited by the consciousness and the physical aims of the individual; it becomes instead a function of the limitless realm of the intellect and imagination, of the creative will. One could make a convenient, if oversimplified, statement of this part of the argument by saying: The great artist would be incapable both of suicide and of murder, for his awareness of a wider scale of values would make either act absurd. In a practical sense, it may be true that we'each think of the key, each in his prison', and the crimi- nal may attempt to force the door. The artist recognises that there is only one valid way out of the prison (and therefore only one valid meaning of the word freedom): to demand away of life that is immedi- ately connected with the values of evolution.l DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE Although I have spoken of the 'artist' as the champion of the'anti- necessity' values, the word is used only as a convenience to cover every type of creative mental worker. In fact, science has probably done rnore for the emergence of new values in four centuries than art and religion have managed in fwo thousand years. It is unfortunate that intellectual fashions in the past century have obscured the nature of science by opposing it to religion (so that when the 'conflict' is spoken of today, many people immediately think of T. H. Huxley versus T. E. Hulme, or Bertrand Russell versus T. S. Eliot, and thus confuse the issues completely). But 'science' is on the basic human intellectual activity, and consists of a certain faith in the concept of order. The primary attitude of the living organism towards its environ- ment is acceptance, and instinctive adiustment to changes. The first man who noticed that the seasons rotate at yearly intervals, and used this knowledge to become a successful farmer, was the first scientist. Instead of merely adjusting himself to the pressure of events, he at ro, I I I ff I t, I THE ..,.! 'l-:t ,-i :,.\\ :,,:i' .1i' ,i, ll.

More than one rt{flp ieered af this ia.a, v'.i there is a certain nobility in it, as in all'W'ells'svisions of the futurel The weaknesses of his scientffic optimism become apparen t tn Men Like Gods. This is partly because thsbook is very bad$ iroittro. \\[ells had almost no artistic conscience about the novel: he realised that a novel will atfract a wider public than a volume of non-fiction, so he frequently set his ideas in the feeblest of stories rather than wriie another social treatise. The consequence is that the modern reader 441 it very hq$ t9 accept All Aboard for Ararat andTheVortd of Ylilliam Clissold. (altho-ugh the latter is.well wogh reading). At the start of Men Lih,e Gofu two motorcars which are drivinf along a counfry road suddenly find themselves on a completely difiirent rEad in another world - a Utopia. In Utopia, eyeryone is beiutiful, free and L?ppy; men- and womet go n-akgd; they communicate by teleparhy. The party of 'earth-people'include a Roman catholic prieit, a fimous politician, an English lady. 'W'ells gets some conventional fun out of satirising thep. Butjt is all so poorly conceived and badly written that it c,reates in the reader a .r.ery determined Utopia-resistance. There is a stiflin-g feeling about his happy and healthy uropia. This can be traced to a kind of authoritarian trend in \\7ells's mind. It is all rather like the picfure of the Good Child painted by a Sunday school teacher to persua{e his pupils to become little angels; any healthy child o-romp-tly does the,opposite. The trouble with'w ells's- m.rr-11ks-gods is that they are nothing like gods. The godlike contains elements of power and mystery; it may be symbolised by lightning in darkness or -by a -orrntain half hidden in clouds; but it is not likely to be evoked by_a Garden q{ Eden picture of innocence and happinlss. Moreover, although \\reils pokqs fun at the polirician with- his lifeless par- liamentary language, his evasions and clich6s, his own faults are-not unrelated to these. There is a mechanicalness about the whole book, a zuperficial way of dealing with the world and human psychology. \\Mells's'virtues are immense - especially in the books hi wrote 6L- tween 1896 and rgro - and there can be no doubt, in the final analysis, that he is_a great writer. But a point arrived in his develop ment when he might profitably have studied Dostoevsky. As it was, the great crisis came only shortly before the end, producing the extra- ordinary Mind at the End of lts Tettrer. unlike Strindberg, 'W'ells was not able to benefit from it by 'curing'himself and at ttre same time deepening and b_roadening himself. At his best,'Wells is as stimulating as p,ure _air and sunlight; his incredible mental energy carries the reader along. At his worst, he has all the faults that intishavians atfributed (falsely) to Shaw: head-without-heart, superficiality, and lack of insight into human psychology. Men Lih,e Gofu makes anti-Utopia books comprehensible. The ancestor of these is Dostoevsky's Notes from Undergroutr.d in.which his beetle-man reiects mathematics and logic, and declares that free. dom is synonymous with the irrational. Vil6ry Briussov's story'The Republic of the Southern Cross' owes something to the beetleman's reasoning.

A strange insanity called 'contradiction-mania' breaks out and ends by wrecking the city; it is man's subconscious need for freedom rather than mere happiness. ZAMIATIN the only anti-Utopia novel that has pretensions to greatness also owes something to Dostoevsky: Eugene Zamiatin's'We, from which both Aldous Huxley and George Orwell would appear to have borrowed liberally. It is, however, a finer novel than either Braye New World ot Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell's novel is ultimately a failure because it has no artistic detachment; it is hysterical, rhetorical, exaggerated. Like Greene's Brighton Roch, its black is too black, and its implied white is too white. Huxley's novel also fails because its antinomies are oversimplified: on the one hand, overmechanised civilisation; on the other, Shakeqpeare and 'culture'. If Huxley had been a Catholic, he might have simplified his task by taking up some of the attitudes of the priest inMen Like Gods who is horrified with the birth control in 'W'ells's Utopia ('refusing to create souls', etc). This would not have been a gteat deal more naive than the attitude he actually takes up. Zamiatrn's book, on the other hand, projects itself very thoroughly into the mind of an enthusiastic inhabitant of the'brave new world. The book is told in the form of a diary kept by D-Soj (all inhabitants of the city have numbers instead of names). He is the engineer of a new rocket. The city is enclosed in a wall made of greenish glass; outside is the old wild-life of the earth; inside there are only huge glass buildings. All inhabitants of the city live in full view of everyone else. The city is ruled by The Benefactor, a Stalinist dictator who is re- elected periodically on'democratic' principles. (He is never opposed, of course.) Sex life is run on a basis of free love, and any inhabitant of the city can sleep with any other inhabitant merely by handing over a pink ticket to the person he or she desires. Zamiadn is a poet, and his pages have none of the atmosphere of neurotic disgust that hangs over Orwell: Spring. From beyond the Green \\[all from the wild plains that Iie out of sight, the wind brings the honeyed yellow pollen of certain flowers. The lips become dry from this pollen; you run your tongue over them every minute or so and, in all probability, all the women you come across have sweet lips now ...

Someone has discovered a simple biain op.rrtioi, that destroys the imaginStion. Everyone in the city is ortered to zubmit to the operation. The engineer does so, and ai the end of the story he is again as 'sane' and balinced as at the beginning. It is interesting to note that this book was -written in Soviet Russia in the early lgzo's, and that Zamiatin was allowed to leave Russia and end his days in Paris (where he died n ry3j of heart disease). The book's cenfral thesis is that of Dostoevsky,s Grand Inquisitor: that-most people cannot bear freedom, so it is beiter to take ,iury the {r..do* and give them happin-ess and- bread. (The Grand Inquisitor fascinated Russian intellectuals of the pre-revolutionary decades; Rozanov wrote a ^commentary _on it that is among his best books.) zamiattn often brings Dostoevsky to mind: as, for.I*r*pl., wh\"o hit engrneel writes: 'Liberation? It's amazing how very teriacious of life criminal instincts are in human kir{ . . .Iiberfy and crime are ;ust as indissolubly bound together as - well, as the *otion of an aero and its speed.'

SCIENCE FICTION AND SPACE OPERA Science fiction sprang from the progressive beliefs that are the essence of science. The spirit of science is a spirit of enterprise; it follows naturally that writers should ask themselves how far the human race can advance through enterprise. It is natural that the first type of science fiction should be portraits of Utopia. It is also natural that space travel should be the next possibility to engage its attention. Cyrano de Bergerac's two novels about a voyage to the moon and a voyage to the sun were published about 166o. One of Poe's best stories tells how one Hans Pfaal rravelled to the moon in a balloon. |ules Verne was one of the first seriously to apply his imagination to the problem of space travel; his moon voyagers are shot out of an enor- mous cannon! Shortly after this came W'ells and his first novel, deal- ing with time travel. LOVECRAFT AGAIN But it would be a misrepresentation of science fiction to suppose that it is entirely devoted to portraying the scientific conquests of the human race. H. P. Lovecraft had occasional recourse to the medium; and his purpose, as usual, was to undermine man's conceit in his scientific knowledge. 'The'W'hisperer in Darkness' is an uneasy com- bination of horror story and science fi.ction. 'The Colour out of Space' is frequently anthologised as science fiction; its 'hideous thing' is a kind of cloud that sucks the life out of living things, and finally returns to space. But Lovecraft's best work of science fiction - and perhaps the most satisfying work in his whole output - is a novel called The Shadow out of Time.In it he loses the tug of war to keep it within the bounds of the horrible, and becomes a good writer of im- aginative science fiction. The Stlo,donu out of Time utilises an idea that had already appeared in 'The Thing on the Doorstep': that minds can be pushed out of their bodies by alien,intelligences, and the body 'used' by the alien. It begins: 'After twenty-two years of nightmare and terror .. . I am unwilling to vouch for rhe tmth of that which I think I found in 'w'estern Australia 9, t!. night of ]uly r7-r8, ryJi: The professor who tells the story lost his memory abrupily, ar,.l aa not icover it for several_ y.rrr. \\7hile his memory was lost, he appeared to continue to live and work as usual, travelling and studying. but his family felt that he has become 'alien'. \\7hat happened, orri leains, is thai the p_rofessor's body was borrowed by a mimber of a civilisation from the distant past. \\Vhile this alien was carrying out research in twentieth- century America, the professor's psyihe-was banished back to the p.1st, and occupied the-body o{ the alien. 'When his memory eventu- ally comes back (i.e., when he finds himself back in his own'bodv), he can no longer _remember anything about the past few yeari''the strange beings have imposed a memory block. But the block is not .strong epough to stop him from having dreams about the city to which he was banished. The'aliens'are iridescent cones, ten feet high, that move around on a contractible base like the suckers that hold shellfish to rocks; they have three tentacles and a kind of head on the end of another t;h;il. frgy--belong to a civilisation that predates humaniry by ^ hundred ,\"d.qry million yeTs.

The Time Machine.Its impact is not the impact Lovecraft intended to make, but that of good science fiction. And science fiction aims at 'daylight' effects. Aristotle stated that tragedy purges through pity and terror. Science fiction is not an aftempt to'purge', but to liberate the human imagination; it achieves this liberation, not by pify and terror, but by attempting to evoke wonder and amazement. (At its best, it may also evoke awe, but this is rare. 'Wells achieves it at the end of The Time Machine, but I can think of few other examples.) By this definition, The Shqdopt out of Time is good science fiction. But it is not, by any stretch of language, a good horror story. It is obvious that the above attempt at a definition of science fiction covers every type of fantasy, from the Odyssey to Baron Munchau- sen's Travels. All that science has done is to provide fantasy with a kind of classical framework, in the same way that Aquinas provirled Dante with a theological framework. Munchausen, like Lucian of Samosata in the True History, produces humorous absurdity after alsurdity, but the effect is like eating too much ice cteam at a party: the extravagances sicken. There is no inner coherence, to draw the reader from page to page. In fact, the reader could almost lay the book down and continue to write it himseH. Compare this with ihe careful scientific explanation that makes Poe's account of Hans Pfaal's journey to the moon so absorbing, or the details given by |ules Verne in his four space novels. In these the reader's credulity il captured; the story appears to unfold according to a logical process. Combined with the spirit of science, the imaginings have a certain authority - the kind that Dante must have possessed for his contemporaries. (This can be seen also in Poe's detective stories, as well as in the Sherlock Holmes stories which are so closely related to them.) BELI's Before theDqwn A typical example of this scientific framework is provided in E. T. Bell's novel Before theDawn Bell, who published his novels under the pseudonym of |ohn Taine, is best known as a mathematician, and author of the classic Men o,f Mathematics. The novel appeared in \\914, and the publishers called it 'a work of fantascience', evidently feeling that 'siience fiction' is not an accurate description. Like \\Tellsk Thne Machine and Lovecraft's Shadow out of Tiine, it is an attempt at the imaginative evocation of another epoch. But Bell is dreams about the past were all delusions.) One +ght he wanders out ; ;;p, and com6s upon an enttance to an underground palace' He go\"r down, and finds Limself back in_ t\\-city of his dreams - now in iii\"r.-fi\"ruy, h. makes his way to lhi ljbrary where he studied, gets ao*\" a noteLook ofl the shelves, and finds notes written in English in his own handwriting. (Lovecraftdoes not bother to explain how a ten- foot cone with tentailei could colne to have the same handwriti$g q a human being with hands.) He hurries out of the ciry, pursued by the semi-material polypus creatures (who have broken out from under their trapdoors). The Shadow out of Time would suffice to make Lovecraft a minor classic, if it were not so overwritten and full of unnecessary adfectives and occasional tautologies (such as a reference to dreams as 'the un- ihecked caprices of sleJp'). but its chief fault is bound up-ryilh Love- craft's intention. He iries hard, by the liberal use of his usual adjectives, to give the story a-n atmosphere of terrot. ('The incalculable ag! and broodling horror dt ttris monstrous waste began.to oPPress me ,i r.u., before,\"and I could not keep from thinking about my mad- a.\"i\"g dreams of the frightful lj-g.rrdt ... And yet I plodded on, as if to sofie eldritch rendez\"vous.' Hlre, in a passige of less than lfry words, there are six unnecessary adjectives.)-But most readers will find his conelike beings interesting raiher than horrible; in fact, why should they be hJrrille? The final efiect of the story (if ygu are not 'irritrtea bf the overloaded language) is to produce an authentic im- pr.rrio\" of u*. and myst.ry, r.itittg on the evocation of vistas of time and space. Edmund Vilson has ieered at this example of Lovecraft's invention as being wholly pr.poti.rous. But Lovecraft's strange'city a1d, its in- habitanls ,r. ,roi intended in themselves to create a sense of horror. The horror lies in the concept that they can move about in time and take over human bodies. Fof this reason, The Shadow out of Time ts ,, ,r.rrrtoally good example of the difierence befween the authentic and the inauth\"entic use of imagiriation. The 'sick' aspect,of Lovecraft it rt produced absurdities hkJ 'The Lurking_ Fear' and 'Pickman's Model' is intent on maintaining his usual spooky atmosphere, arrd for this reason he sets the story in 'Arkham' where most of his horror stories take place, and throws in the usual references to the Necro- iomicon of ithe mad Arab Abdul Alhazred', the Comte D'Erlette's iultrs des Goul.e.s, etc., but it would seem that, whether he likes it or not, Love craltis growing out of these childish fantasies (the novel was wriitet towards It . ..tf, of his life), and his imagination is becoming more at home in the mysteries of 'the common daylight. If all Love rr6 { '{ I t17 i,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"logrPJ en-og8h to realise that time travel is an impossibiliry. \\flells had explained that time is merely the fourth dimensibn, and tLat men will one day travel_in time as they now walk along oxford Street. Like Lovecraft, he did not bother to face all the obvious paradoxes that would arise: for example, that a'time traveller' could travel back to yesterday and pick up his 'self of the day before, then travel back another day and pigk up his 'self'of two days ago, and accumulate an army consisting of an infinite number of 'himselves'. In short, it would involve an infinite number of parallel worlds, each one a frac. tion of a second behind its neighbour, so that time travel would be a 'sideways' progress from one world to another. As a mathematician, Bell is aware of all this. So he makes an alternative suggestion. Sound can be recorded on wax discs; why should the rocki of the distant past also not contain records of everything they have 'seen'? The Russian science-fiction writer Yefremov makes a similar suggestion i13 s-tory called 'Shadow of the Past', in which an enormous crystal cliff has 'photographed' a prehistoric monster.2 But Yefremov's 'photo' is static; Bell suggests that if we could find the means to 'plry them back', crystals might reveal moving pictures of the past. In his novel, a group of technicians who are investigating electronic technique-s f_or assessing the age of archaeological obieits stlumble on a method of playing back the record of the rocks. A tiny needle of light travels over.the surfa_ce o{ the object, searching out thi changes duito the impact of light. The book is written as iflt is an actual-scientific record; each chapter tells of some small advance in knowledge. The result is a moving and-vivid picture of past geological ages that-has an effect similar to that of \\[ells's Ou.tlini of Hlstory. Be[?escribes great lakes, carboniferous forests, the emergence of ihe amphibians,\"and finally the passing -of_ the dinosaurs. He is particularly effective in creating a picture-of the meaningless brutality of nature, Tennyson,s 'nature red in tooth and claw'. Bell's novel is a classic of the purest fype of science fiction - that is to say, fiction_that depends for its effect iolely on the vision of science. Pure science fiction attempts to evoke the same rype of wonder that watching a_chemical experiTent produces in an ileven-year-old. It attempts to be realistic. It might be judged by the followinghyporheri- cal test. Suppose the existence of a! alien b-eing from ano-thefplanet, similar to our own. Suppose that this being iioflered such scientific works as Darwin's voyage of the Beagle, a life of Madame curie, Schliemann's account of his discovery- of Troy, and a popular history of the development of science since Newton.

They wake-up a_f1er fifty years or so, take more of the drug, and sle_ep on for ano_ther fifty years. In this way they are still young men when they reach the star. But when they arrive, a surprise iwaits them. Since their space ship set out, humin science hai made im- mense advances, and has constructed space ships that can cover the iourney in- a fraction of the time. when they arrive, the star is already colonised by men from earth. Un{ortunately, the author has no ide-a of how to finish his story, but the first part is impressive because it makes the reader aware of the immensiry of space. fhe men who leave earth on a two-hundred-year voyage are severing themselves from all their human connections, and from the human race. By the time they arrive on the star, all their relatives on earth will be dead. The story jars the reader's imagination to a new viewpoint. our imaginations are anthropocentric, earthbound; they prefer to deal with the emotions with which they are familiar - human love and hate. In this sense, a story like van Yoght's can be considered as a new departure for the human imagination, which since Homer has dea[t with warmer and more familiar emotions. Van Voght brings this home at the beginning of the story, where the narrator mentions a pretty girl who kissed him as he climbed into the space ship and then reflects that she is now either a grandmother or dead, although it seems only a few hours since she kissed him. But towards the enf,, the space trivellers decide that they are uncomfortable in the world of the future; van Voght does a little iuggling with scientific terminology, 'time vor- tices', etc., and his space travellers go plunging back in time, so that the narrator can rejoin the pretfy girl who has kissed him. The 'strangeness' created by the story is broken in favour of the emotions we are familiar with. The author looks into the abyss and then furns tail. Still, it is something to have looked into the abyss. And for its first half, the story is an excellent example of the almost theological note sounded by the best science fiction. It recalls Pascal's phrase about the 'eternal silences of these infinite spaces', but it also has the merit of bringing it home to the imagination more forcibly than Pascal does. At its best, science fiction has this effect of ierking the imagination out of its anthropocentric prison yard and stirring it into a new kind of perception. As Edmund Crispin points out in his infroduction to the first volume of Best Science Fiction, many science-fiction stories take an extremely pessimistic outlook on contemporary history. Some end with the destruction of the human race in atomic warfare. Others take r20 a glgomy pleasure in emphaiising that the human race is a mere passing- episode ,in th,e history of the earth: this type of story is not particularly profould gt original - its grea t-gtandfither is c'rttiu.r,s visit to the land of the Houyhnhnms - ind wI need not take seriously Mr crispin's assertion th_atits pessimism constitutes a genuine.moral content'. others again take thebpposite attitude - that [\"*r\"ity r*y .only be another of nature's r*piii-ents, but that it is a hiehly suc- cessful one, and w-e all ought to be rather proud to be h;;;--r -- But there are also many stories that r.Li.u. an exciting pressure of ideas, on the same level is van voght,s .Far Centaururl a case of conscience by ]ames Blish deals wilh a distant ptranet i\"rrrrit.a ry semi-reptilian creatures of extraordina_ry -gentleniss and i\"t\"ttg*...

The disiussion is on , t.u.t tr,rt;;;;, with the Russian novel of the nineteenth centuryi it is astonishing to realise that this story was printed in a pulp i'agazine for sale\"on newsstands. I A favourite science-fiction theme is the problem of identity. Brian Aldiss has an excellent stoiy called ,out,ide, that achieu., ,, i\"t.\"- sity that is reminiscent of Kafka. It uses the Kafka t..rr\"ifu. --, favourite with science-fiction authors - or *riti\"e about a siiuation from'inside', making no efiort to relate it to irr. or\"airrry;rrld;i lh. fid:lj it.is un to thi reader to keephis wirs abour him and to g.asp the situation from odd hints and clues dropped by the autho\"r. In Aldiss's story six people are living in a windo*I.r, horrr. - four men and two women. Every day food ipp.rrr; no one asks wherc it .o*., from. They plpy cards-to piss the time. No one seems to wonder what there is outside the house. The situation is not unlike Beckett,s - or human life on earth. Bur one man, Harley, is troJted ;;J b&;\", to _investigatg. H. discovers that creat,rr.r of an alien race, known as Nititians, have b:grr infiltrati-ng_among human beings, and constitute a great threat. Nititians can 'kill a mai, dispose of hIm, and furn into .ex3ct replicas of him'.

Th.y all continue to maintain their human form by a kind of self-hypnosis; only great stress can cause a breakdown. At this point, Harley points out that he is a human being, as he speaks, he feels himseH dissolving and turning into a Nititian. He is told: 'Like earth insects that imitate vegetables, your cleverness cripples you. You can only be carbon copies. Because |agger did nothing in the house, all the rest of you instinctively followed suit, You didn't get bored - you didn't even try to make passes at Dapple . ..' In a story of less than five thousand words, Mr Aldiss has succeeded in creating an effective symbol of the human condition and posing the problem ''Who am I?' in a new and startling way. His treatment of the problem of identify is certainly more economical and artistically suc- cessful than, say, that of Max Frisch in his highly praised novel Stiller (which has been compared to Kafka and Mann). All the same, it should be noted that some of Aldiss's themes appear elsewhere. Van Voght has a story called 'The Sound' about 'aliens' who can impersonate human beings; Philip K. Dick's Imposter uses the idea of a fake human being who does not know that he is an alien. Stock themes appear in icience fiction as much as in folklore and fairy tales. A story called 'Hobson's Choice'by Alfred Bester treats the theme of time travel with unusual thoughtfulness. It sets out to explode 'escapist'ideas about the past; its moral is that a man is most comfort- able in the age he has been born into, even if he.casts wistful glances back to the Ancient Greeks or the Elizabethans. It sounds a note of breezy'realism' that recalls Shaw and '\\7ells; but it is interesting that Bester should have needed to choose the medium of science fiction to express his ideas on escapism. Again one becomes aware that science fiction seems to have escaped the general sense of defeat, the cult of 'the little man', that pervades so much modern writing. The writings of Robert A. Heinlein deserve special mention in this context. Like Lovecraft, Heinlein has tried to build up a kind of mythology - only in this case, it is a mythology of the future. Most of his volumes have an appended chart of 'Future History, tg5r-z6oo', Heinlein's work varies in quality; at its worst it can be sentimental, whimsical or melodramatiC; but at its best it combines imagination with a careful realism; he might almost be described as a Zola of the future. Among living writers of science fiction, he has the most con- sistently high quality and, together with Weinbaum, is the writer whose work most deserves to be considered simply as literafure. Another writer of curiously inconsistent quality is Ray Bradbury. 122 '.fwl *rr:ryrl.i. \"l pure, fol,ru.ry_, he somerimes compares with Vells. ..lt l I**:'l9:l yy.J carred\"Lo,relei;i1i;'iripr[, (wri*en in cor- '$ I laborationwith[eighn',.[Jqi',nexercisei\"til#;[1fi:i..t'; though ir is ser onV.n,rr, r..rk lh; -N;;;;;*;and the Odyssey. ,ii { (The resemblance .may !,e inrentional) fui f,rraf\"ry;;-il;r, .rj; curious obsession about_children, and this mrt , **, of his stories 't seem near-pathological.

They clothe their stories in an armour of technical terms that makes them as impenetrable as the later Henry |ames, and that frequently conceals i mushiness o{ ltgr_._ot}rP.-d emotion and attitudei that-would do credit to Amanda McKittrick Ros. Nevertheless, at its best there is a great deal to be said for science fiction. It often shows a vitality and inventiveness that have been absent from literature since the nineteenth+entury romantics. Its writers havq, it might seem, become shghtly delirious at being-told that they needn't wolry any more about Ulysses and the end of the modern novel, and haviplunged into a debauch of pure fan-tasy.,Brad- bory exemplifies this in its best and worst aspects; when he-is bgirg subiective ind'individual', the result is often morbid rubbish; when he decides to write a straight adventure story, he reveals himself as a powerful creative talent. As a 'shakespearein fish' he is completgly iuccessful; when he tries to be'modernl he goes to pieces. This makes one wonder how many other authors are doomed to mediocrity in a straitiacket of 'honesty' and tealism. CONCLUSION Sartre's La Nauste stands at the end of a cul-de-sac of the imagina- tion, a symbol of 'mind at the end of its tether', honesty that has fumbled its *ty to a standstill. Self-analysis has ended in total en- feeblement. I have tried to show that this complete blankness in the face of 'realiry' is also the basic animal response to_nature - ignorance and acceptance; and, when catastrophe strikes, defeatism. In contrast to this,^the spirit of science stands fbr action and progress. Before the rise of science] *to looked to religion and the day of iudgment to achieve the final liberation of spirit from its bonds. Francis Bacon was among the first to transfer this role to science - i.e., to human knowledge. But the kind of liberation forecast by Bacon and the Italian humanists was purely intellectual. It must have seemed to them that the human spiril had-entered a new domain, achieved_a new Powelof c_onquegt.Jn ,'.ligion, all was 'revealed' and the theologian was the slave of the srrilture. In science, a man was his own master; he could construct a t;i^em of the world with no reference to the Old Testament; its only necessiry was internal consistency. lhis is the spirit of science fiction, from More's Utopia onwa_rd.It is a spirit that oiten betrays its enthusiasts into naivety, the kind of t24 ;! oversimpl,ification of human nature revealed in Men Like Gods. lt applies to the imagination the stimulus of intellect, but shows no psychological grasp of human nature. (Psychological insight, while it mixes well enough with religion, seems to find no special interest in science.'\\7'riters like Blake, Dostoevsky, ]oyce, D. H. Lawrence seem to be actively anti-scientific. In Pascal, psychological insight was pressed into the service of religion, but science remained in a watertight com- partment;) And yet there can be no doubt that the stimulus applied to the imagination by science is somehow more 'authentic' than the kind of stimuli Lovecraft and Yeats applied. 'lVells's novels may be criticised for oversimplifying the reality of human nature, but their &stortion is innocent compared to Lovecraft's. But the problem of imagination is the problem of its relation to 'reality'. The answer to be gathered from |oyce, Beckett, Sartre and Yeats (in'The Circus Animals' Desdrtion') is that imagination cannot live with rcality; it must be annihilated by it. Imagination is lies. (\\Vhat theme had Homer but original sin?) InCritne andPunishment, Svidrigailov admits that he sometimes imagines that eternity is the corner of a stuffy room, covered with spiderwebs. This, Beckett and Sarfre i*ply, is the fruth of it. '\\V'hen you consider it honestly, realiry is that coat hanging on the door, that fly perched in the corner of the ceiling. Reality is defeat, old age and death. Man is chock full of illusions and vitality, thoughtfully provided by life to srop him from {acing the awful realiry. But the day has to come; one day man has to lie down in the rag-and-bone shop of the heart. The answer of science is ilore optimistic. Imagination is the herald of change. This is the view that Yeats took in his more optimistic moods, and in 'Under Ben Bulben' he declares that Michelangelo's figures on the Sistine chapel roof are there to inspire men to strive for though he is fanti-rational', Yea greatness, the final aim being'profane rg 'profane perfection of mankind'. So al- , Yeats ended his life holding the same ,,.i1. , ,::i .t riii , ,'. \\.. .):,. '1 ,'. i: ,. t'.. views on imagination as V'ells and Shaw. His'profane perfection'is another way of saying'men like gods'. For'W'ells, the imagination inspired by science can look to the very near future for the fulfilment of its dreams. The world state is around the corner; men grow wiser every year,Iearning by their mistakes. Shaw takes a slightly more metaphysical view of the imagination. Michelangelo is also one of Shaw's favourite examples, although he preferred the sibyls and prophets to the muscular young men and cherubs. Shaw has a great passage in Back to Methuselah that sum- mari.ses his vision of the purpose of imagination.

Tolstoy's peasants commit murder, adultery, theft and finally infan- ticide in the mean and narrow spirit of Zola's peasants inEarth..The scene of the murder of the brby must be one of the most harrowing in dramatic literature. But pldinly, Tolstoy's feeling is that evil is basi- cally stupidity. It is insensitivify to the suffering of others. Finally, and most important, it is a miscalculation of the yalue of life. lf. a millionaire died of chagrin when he lost half-a-crown down a drain, it would prove a breakdown in his sense of values, a failure to assess the extent of his possessions. ffre study of, for example, the Burke and Hare murders produces the impression that they had miscalculated the value of their own lives (not to mention those of their victims). It is obvious that the miscalculation was caused by the appalling social conditions of Edinburgh in r8ro; that in a sense Burke and Hare had very little 'to live for'. No doubt Traherne and Nietzsche are right no human being has ever yet had the smallest glimpse of the value of llfe. A man about to be executed may have more idea of it than most of us; but even he can form no real estimate. And yet Shaw is also righil a sense of the value of life can only be cultivated by people who have the money and leisure to study biautiful things. Th6'miscalculation' of Burke and Hare was a social rather than a moral matter. There is hardly need to comment that Lovecraft would have found this view completely repellent. So, no doubt, would Graham Greene. There is a certain type of writer for whom it is necessary to believe in the positive existence of evil, evil as a batlike monster, as the Eternal Adversary, waiting to drag human beings to perdition.'With most of them - as with Lovecraft and Greene - the view does not make for serious literature. It has the same eflect as the scientific optimism of V'ells - a certain oversimplification. But it has another quality in common with scientific optimism: it acts as a powerful stimulus on the imagination. The present chapter is concerned with the preoccupation with evil, and its effect on the imagination. I have already commented that science provides the imagination with a framewoik, analogous to the theology of Dante. The'ftwer of rz8 darkness' school_of wliting-has no such framework, and is always striving to provide itseH with one. This is the reason that so much bf the literature of evil seems so curiously lacking in backbone. This seems to be true on all levels of merit, from Dostoevsky to Lovecraft. Dostoevsky was temperamentally opposed to Tolstoy's pragmatic, un- mystical -view of the nature of evil, and yet his own honesty led him _continually to endorse it. Vhen the devil appears to Ivan Kiramazov, he admits he is a figm_ent of Ivan's imaginition; instead of being a Ig11. oI terror and evil, he is a seedy and brash individual. Stavro[in lnTheDe,rils tries hard to be sinful, and ends by having to admit tf,at he is not stupid enough to be_ evil. \\7hat is more, theri is something unconvincing about Dostoevsky's attempts to write about evil; for a[ !$ pgwer, there is an adolescent quality about The Deyils. Aldous Huxley's remarks on Dostoevsky ire pertinent and valid: 'All Dos- t-oevsky's characters . .. ate ... emotional onanists, wildly indulging themselves in the void of imaginatiofr . . . But however agonising t\"hey may be . . . the_se ffagedies . . . ?r€ fundamentally ludicrois and idiotic. Th.J are the absurdly unnecessary tragedies of ielf-made madmen.' The sheer length of. The Devils- and its accumulation of detail make it difficult to judge as a whole; but anyone who has read camus,s potted *3ge version of it cannot fail to agree with Huxley. .If stavro- gin could have gone to bed with womenhe hked, instead of sleeping, _on_satanically ascetic principles, with women he detested; if f.iritdv had had a wife and a iob of decent work; if pyotr stepanovitch had ever looked with pleasure at a landscape or piayed ulith a kitten - none of these fragedies, these fundamentally ludiirous and idiotic fra- gedies, would have taken place.' If this is true of a writer of Dostoevsky's stature, what can be said for Lovecraf.tandother writers of subjective fantasy? Nevertheless, if taken on its own level, the literafure of evil and the supernatural provides some interes-ting glimpses into the working of T?gyration. To begin with, its lack oI i framework or a backgro[nd of belief, throws into relief the peculiarities and obsessions of i,rai- vidual writers. Dostoevskyyfgr ex-amp_le, fwice associated the rape of a .ten-year-old gyl with his vision of evil; yet it would seem, to iuige by his work and his life story, that he *rr, if anything, underseiealt it possible to find a connection between lack of sexuil development and preoccupation with supernatu_ral evil?r A respected En$is6 critic has suggeste_d that the stories of M.

(Trovatore seems to owe some of its more preposterous twists to Hoflmann's story 'The Deserted House,, which .^rrd, ir, \" splendid confusion of husbands lost and found, babies stolen by gypsies, etc.) The chief ihterest of Hoffmann, in the present context, is the clear division in his stories between the healthy and the morbid. At his best, his stories are like a natural growth, like an oak tree in spring, with a Tols-toy-an vitality. But when-the element of the morbid eirteriinto frit work lit..l damp wind, immediately the stories are artificially twisted towards disaster. The two elements should be clearly grasped, for they are fun- damental to the r_t\"dy of imagination.

But 'obsessed' literature cannot be great unless It ,ko por- sesses the living-organism quality; for otherwi-se the obsessed artiit is imposing his wil! on lifeless shadows. At his best, Dostoevsky has the organic, inevitable_feeling; his most satisfying books - poor Folh, The House of th_e Dead, crime and Punishtnent i produce the impression of a man whose roots are in the earth. on the other hand, his worst books have all the bad qualities of Hofimann (whose influence on Dostoevsky was great, particularly with a story.ru.d .The Doubles,j; such novels as A Raw Youth and The tnsulted and the lnjured de- uglop into-a confusion of character and incident. They lose the feeling of life, and one becomes aware of Dostoevsky the puppet master jerk- ing the strings frantically GOGOL Go_gol's work contains the _same opposing qualities. Gogol was another unhappy qd peyllly maladjusted man. (His only seiual experience was onaniTic.) Iodry, it is hard to believe that'Gogol *r, brr.. ,.- garded as the father of Russian realism. Gogol's world is real, but it r3z !3s_very little in common with the'real' world; it is eteated, like Hoffmann's, out of a tremendous vitality of imagination. At its best it lppears to be based on close observation - ai in Dead souls, The lnspt_ector,Talas Bulba. At its worst, fantasy has no kind of anchor; it hardly rises above the level of a dream. 'T[e Nose'which many Rus- sians find incredibly funny, is about a man who loses his nose and tries to track it down; the nose ends up drirriog a cariage and four around St Petersburg. Even allowing for the f.ict that oir.r are re- garde{ as inherently funny in Russia-, the story is as unsatisfactory as Poe's feeble attempt at humour in 'Loss of Breath,. This is because its absurdities are as arbifrary as those of Baron Munchausen or Lucian of Samosata. The same is true of 'shponka andHis Aunt,, another of his famous'humorous' stories. Some of his best..grotesque stories are marred by this quality of arbitrary fantasy. The famous 'overcoat' beginr ,r , piece'or sriern realism but ends in supernatural fantasy, witn the htfre clerk halnt- inq.St Petersburg.'N9vs$?rospect' has--the same pattern. It begins by I.llirg hg* 1 shy artisr fills in love wirh a beautifll girl in the\"streei, follows her home, and discovers that she is a prosiitute; when she Ipeatt_, her voice is coarse and vulgar. Then thi story turns into a bewildering dream-fan tasy. -Gogol's most successful !-tgry, 'The Terrible Revenge', is a fine piece of rhetorical writing, describing the life of cossacks, tie'river Dnilper, the Russian counfryside; its story of magicians and brave .orrr.li, i, gr-rtirgly convincing for_three quirters of its length; then abruptly, it dissolves into the usual mist bf fantasy.

Dead Souls shows that Gogol was rrying to develop his tendency to portray the 'real' world rather than the world of fantasy; he makes an attempt to drop his method of exaggerafion and caricature. It is generally agreed that this fragment is inferior to the first part so it may be that,ifter all, Gogoldied at the right time. He was no realist; the practical world frightened him; this was why he never dared to approaih women, and why his brief career as a professor of history was a failure. '\\7hen his imlgination ceased to be triumphantly self-justified, when he began to feel that he should establish contact with the 'real' world of religion and politics, he collapsed. As a curiosity, it might be mentioned that Sergei Aksakov, the ' oldest of the great Russian writers of the nineteenth century, had an immense admiration for Gogol, and was one of Gogol's most inde- fatigable publicists. And yet it would be hard to name two writers less alike than Gogol and Aksakov. Aksakov was the first great Russian to write the treelike, organic novel, and his Family Chronicle andYears of Childhood are full of the spirit of the open air; without them, tWar and Peace could never have been written. Before Aksakov, Russian literature was episodic and dramatic, influenced by Scott and'Byron; Aksakov changed it by producing three'autobiographical'noveli that are not in the least concerned with incident or drama but with'truth to life'.4rd yet Aksakov, who could see little merit in Griboyedov and Pushkin, became the high priest of the Gogol cult. He was at- tracted by Gogol's realism, the use of Russian peasant material. Of the strange imaginative fever that inspired and finally killed Gogol he had little idea. How could he? Next to lzaak W'alton, Aksakov must be the least neurotic writer of stature who ever lived. GHOSTS AND THE SUPERNATURAL Today,- the devotee of science is seldom the believer in the super- natural. In the Middle Ages, they were almost the same thing. The twelfth-century chemist Theophilus the Monk could describe how to ryake gold from the ashes of basilisks, red copper, powdered human blood (from a redheaded man) and vinegar; yei the iame ffeatise con- tains sober accounts of how to'make glass and how to separate silver from gold with the use of sulphur. The pseudo Democrirus describes how to make a crystal with white lead and glass, and then'to this crysta_l add the urine of an ass, and after forty days you will find emeralds'. It is hard for us to grasp the state of mind in which these supernatur-al marvels were taken completely for granted, as if they \\rere as well established as the theory oT gravity or the composition of water. It comes home when one reads of the Buddha's 'early struggles for light' in the Maijhima-nih,aya. Gautama tells the Brahmin |inus- soni_how !r-e practised various disciplines to subdue his body; he star- v_ed himself, practised holding his breath, and invented penances. All this is usual enough in the records of asceticism. But he-then goes on to say, 'Then_ Brahmin, I thought: Suppose now that on thosJnights that are notable . . . the fifteenth and eighth of the month - suppose I spend them in shrines of forest, park or tree, fearsome and hair-riising as they are . . . that I may behold for myself the panic fear and horror of it all.' He describes how every casual sound terrified him in the shrines, and how he used his will to subdue the 'panic fear and horror'. we think of the Buddha as a symbol of the most rigorously _pragmatic attitude to life, the man who found God ,r, ,nri...rrrry hypothesis in _considering the problem of how man can escape his suffering. And yet h9 -appears_ to have taken ghosts sufficiently for granted to make use of them in his ascetic disciplines.2 Since the cosmology_ of the medieval church was replaced by the cosmology_of science, the supernatural is no longer taken for granted. It is this that adds interest to the study of modern literature of the supernatural. And here one becomes aware that the belief in the supernatural is usual]y_a lorm of compensation. This emerges clearly from consideration of Hoffmann and Gogol. Yet even here in imporf- ,# ri.{ 5, s ry 'j at r34 r35"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"a:rt difierence- can be seen. C,rgol was financially independent; he was the pagplred son of a fond mother. His woik is ilways unreal - particularly before Dead Souls. Hoffmann spent alarge prrt of his life actively grappling *it\\ poverty and the drearinesr- oi ,rr.ongenial work, and his work is always closer to reality than Gogol's; theie is a fundamental sense of lile and real people. - It may seem that talking about thi degree of 'reality' in stories of the supernatural'is a futile form of-hair-splitting. Yet this is not really so, {or the supernatural can be used to convey t[e artist's own r.or. of 1e.aliry. I tried to illustrate this in analysing Lovecraft,s Shadow out of Time, with its mixture of 'authentic'- and 'inauthentic' imagination. Yet Lovecraft's imagination, even at its most adolescent, has -a certain power; o_ne cari feel that it is rooted in deep emotions. Many modern tales of the supernatural seem inauthentic in every sense. This applies, for example, to most of the writing of Algernon illackwood. It ci\" be seen in 'Ancient Sorceries', an enormously long story that pays care- ful attention to the building up_ of atmoipheri and obviously is in- tended as a tour de f,orce, but only succeedi in being more feeLle and irritating thap anything in Loveiraft. Vezin, on h\"olidry in F;;;;, stops overnight at a pictaresque little town, likes the restful atmos- phere, and .4ecide_s to stay_ on. But the people keep reminding him of cats. He falls in love with the catlike daughter bf the inn.-The de- velopment of the story is tediously prorracted. Eventually Vezin re- alises that the town is bewitched, that its inhabitants turrr themselves into cats for a witches' sabbath, and that his ancestors had lived here and particie_ated in the rites. The woman tries to persuade him to join in the witches' sabbath, but he manages to tear hirnself away and return to England. The story ends feebly. - As a two-page anecdote in a book on witchcraft, the story might be of interest to the social historian. Blackwood uses u porLront rnachinery of _sophistication to try to make it convincing, but the plot remains_puerile 3-\"q tlg stery contains no'meaning'beyond its plot. Henpr |-ames called 'The Turn of the Screw' 'a fiiry iale pure-and simple', but its subject - the deliberate corruption of innocenie - gives . it a weight and seriousness that Blackwood does not possess. The consideration of. why Blackwood's story is uniatisfactory again emphasises the difference between the authentic and inauthentic use o{ imSgination. It is irrelevant here that it is long-winded and full of clich6s. The important reason emerges if one asks the question: V'hat if o1e_ weJe completely convinced by the story? \\fhat kind of world would it be in which a town can exist, marked on the map of France, easily reached by rail, in an ideal situation for holidaymakers, and yet ry6 full of lycanthr_opgr?

Unfortunately, too few writers on the supernatural have this atti- tude; so it is only possible to read most ghost stories in a spirit of derision. This is true, for example, of most of the stories in Montague Summers's Supernatural Omnibus. Evelyn Nesbit's ,Man Size in Marble' is typical. This is told by a painter who has gone to live in a cottage rtear a churchyard with his newly wedded wife. On either side of the altar arc two marble figures of knights, and the legend attached to the place declares that they get up on AII Saints' Eve and walk across to the cottage in which the painter lives. Before All Saints'Eve, the wife has presentiments of evil, and the painter broods on the legend. Finally, on the evening, he feels oppressed and goes out for a walk, in the course of which he enters the church and sees that the r-tarble figures are missing. Their stone footprints lead to the cottage; he rushes in and finds his wife is dead. She holds a marble finger in her hand. The reader can guess what is going to happen from the first page of the story, and when the painter decides to go for a stroll on the fatal ev_ening,,leaving his wife alone, the plot creaks audibly. But the worst thing about it is that the reader can easily reconstruct the im- aginative process that led to its composition; the sight of a marble figure in some churchyard, the schoolgirl frisson at the thought of how horrible it would be if it could move; finally, the completely obvious story constructed with a ruler and dividers. Like the-Blacli- wood story, it comes very close to simply telling lies. SHERIDAN LE FANU AND M. R. JAMES Sheridan Le Fanu deserves to be compared with Hoflmann and Poe. His neglect in England is astonishing, for he is the only great writer on the supernatural that this country has ever produced. Le Fanu's life follows the pattern that we have come to expect of writers of fantasy. 'W'hen he was thirty (in rSaa) he married an excep tional woman, and had fourteen years of happy married life. Then his wife died. Le Fanu withdrew into solitude in his house in Merrion Square, Dublin, and spent the remaining fifteen years of his life writ- ing his famous ghost stories and mystery novels. He wrote at night, sitting up in bed. He spent the day indoors, emerging in the late afternoon to wander round second-hand bookshops, looking for ghost stories. In his later years he refused to receive any visitors; even his friend Charles Lever was turned away from the house shortly before r18 - As might be expected frorn a man who hail been happily married, there is no horror of wdmen in Le Fanu's work. Nor cai iris stories be called'romantic'in the sense that Hoffmann's or Gogol's can, though they have the same imaginative vitality. - t9 Fanu's_app-roac_h_to his ghosts ii sometimes in the spirit of the Society for Psychical Research: a clinical interest. \\7e find this atti- tude in the excellent 'Narrative of the Ghost of a Hand', and in his best novel, The House_by the_Churchyard. At other times, his ghosts are in the folklore tradition: the kind ihat might be sung of in bllads. These are the type of 'sir Dominick's Bargain', 'schalke-n the painter, and'Madame Cfowl's Ghost'. And there ire the ghosts that are closer qr spirit to Poe, or even Dostoevsky: the ghosts Jf trr. sick mind.like the evil monkey inthe classic'Green Tei, or the half-real specire of conscience in 'fhe Familiar'. 'carmilla' is probably the u.ri^ur*pir. story ever written; unlike Bram Stoker's Dracul,a it is not union- sciously funny. Finally, Le Fanu was a skilful writer o{ tales of sus- pense:_ The Room at the Dragon Yolant, Wylder,s Hand,lJncle Silas andThe House by tlte Churchyard are all clissics of mystery writing. All these were written in the small'hours of the urorning, by tt. liglt of fwo candles, in the silent house in Merrion square.lq.t ii*.t Le Fanu resembles Lovecraft in seeming to hope to frigLten the reader to death. But Le Fanu is a better writef than Love r::afi,, a more assured craftsman, and his spell is alfogether more potent. It is worth observing that his climaxes are ustlally of physical vic- Ience. The House_by-the Churchyard has a horrifying arid grisly tre- panning scene; uncle Silas has a murder scene in wlich the wrong person g-ets murdered; Vylder's Hand ends with the barking of dogs at a blackened twig sJlcking out of a bank - the twig proves Io be tlie hand of the dead \\[ylder.Ii TheRoom at theDragoiyotoit, yorrg man is about to be buried alive under the influJnce of a drug that paralyses him but leaves him the full use of his senses. The\" final horror of 'Green Tea'(which so,me consider the most convincing ghost s_tory ever written) is the suicide of the 'possessed' man, who cuts his throat with arazor and covers the floor with blood. But Le Fanu is not an 'obsessed' writer; he is coolly in charge of his creation, he plans his effects, and he is not necessariiy taken ii, ly t is own ghosts. He produces his impact on the readei by skilful'and imaginative storytelling and climaxes of violence that ofien aim at the effects that are to be found in Zola. He has outgrown the desire to create ghosts and horrors as a gesture of rejection of the .real world,. l; { t:':' ':1, '.:: i.

His greatest horrors are psychological. It is fitting that Le Fanu should have died like a character in one of his own stories. Towards the end he had a recurrent nightmare of berqs_in an a_ncient, tottering house, and would wake up crying out with horror that it was about to fall on him. His doctor was-treiting him for heart disease. After Le Fanu's death, the doctor noticed the terrified expression on his face, and commented: 'I thought so - that house fell at last' One of Le Fanu's most fervent admirers was M. R. |ames, a Cam- bridge don who gained a limited fame with his Ghosi Stories of an Antiquarv. |ames is by no means as good as Le Fanu, but the reader of the Ghost Stories of an Antiquary will be againstruck by the physical violence in them. |ames's ghosts are very likely to itrangle - their victims or to inflict some horrible disfigurement on them. What is most significant, however, is that they completely lack a centre of gravify. Poe's tales are all expressions of Poe's temperament; Love- craft's all centre upon the same mythology. ]ames's stories seem to be all_over the place. They might almost have been written by several different men. 'Canon Alberic's Scrapbook' is about a man who comes into pos- session of a large folio scrapbook. On one of its pages is a picture of a monster. The man who sells it to him gives him a crucifix, which he advises him to wear. Later, the man removes the crucifix from his neck as he looks at the book; then he notices something at his elbow; it is the hand of the demon pictured in the book. He leaps out of his chair, and sees that it was standing behind him, its other hand poised over his head. Two servants rush into the room, and the monster (invisible to them) pushes past them. In his most famous story 'Oh 'Whistle and I'll Come to You My Lad', a professor on holiday finds a whistle on the beach; when hL blows it, he sunrmons some kind of spirit into his bedroom. At the end of the story, he finally manages to see this spirit; it has a f.ace af. crumpled linen, and seems to be attired in a sheet; when it attacks him, he faints. 'The Diary of Mr Polmter' is about a man who buys an old diary and finds a piece of material pinned to one of its pages; the cloth has a rippling pattern that looks like hair. He likes the pattern so much that he has a great deal of cirrtaining made with ttre same pattern, and hangs so'rne of it_in his bedroom. one evening, he dozes off to sleep in an armchair, and feels his hand touching something which he takeJ to r40 r' be hisspaniel.'\\7hen he looks down, it is a human figure crouching at the side of his chair, its face completely covered bylong, wavy h-air. As he fries to rush from the room, the thing makes a fee6le attempt to attack him, but he escapes There'would be no point in detailing more of fames's plots; he wrote 9.rty thirty stories, and most of these havb physiial ghosts or 'creatures'.4guin, one observes that the quiet, retired writer, living in ; rela_tive comfort - even luxury - feels the compulsion to create physi : cal horrors, ghosts that, after all, could frighten no one but a neryous schoolboy. (Towards the end of his life,- ]ames wrote a few ghost stories for schoolboys; they are incredibly bad.)

TOLKIEN IghtRonald Reuel Tolkien, an oxford don, published his The Lord o!' theRings (three volumes) in the mid-r95os. High claims \\Mere made for : lhe wolk by noted critics. Richard Hughes compared it to Spenser's , Faerie Queene, c. S. Lewis to Ariosto, Naomi Mitihison to Malory. A r dissenting opinion came from a well-known novelist who dismissed i the work as'don's whimsy'. At the present time, it is impossible to decide whether Tolkien has produced a classic.

The above summary fails to do justice to the book's vitality. Anyone who_ has tried to read straight through Buchan,s Richaid Hannay novels, or Haggard's Alan Quatermain ieries, will recall that the attention begins to flag towards the middle of the second or third volume. Tolkien gives the impression that he could have made the book three tirnes as long, and siitl showed no sign of exhaustion. As far as I know, no critic has so far tried to trace all the sources of The Lord of the Rings.Its resemblance to '!f'agner's Ringhas already been remarked.

This is not entireiy untrue, but no book *r, .f., roiirr., from the spirit of a textbook. A few words should be said about De Sade. He was born in r74o, and develgped- a taste for sexual excess. For instance he p.ia pr6Jti tutes to allow him to make shallow cuts on them, which nd nuea with ' hot sealing wax. sg*g of his explo-its eventually ianded uir\"l\" prir.* There he wrote the books for-which he is inost fanorrs --fiiilrir, luliette, Philosophy_of th2 poudoir and The no Days. aft., irr. French Revolution, he tried hard to ingratiate himself with the revo- lutionaries - apparently hoping that The Revolution would lead to total abandonment of moral preiudices - and wrote a curious docu- ment urglng the French to free themselves from the tyranny of God and moralit lo_* they had executed the king, the .reprer.ritrtiu. tt God on eafih'. !n the same perverse spirit, Eaudelaire was later to declare that he fgught on the barricadei only because he believed so enthusiastically in vice and tortule) In rgo3, he was confined ajain, this time declared incurable; he died in rgif, having spent twe\"niy- four years in iail. It should be observed that most of De Sade,s sadism was wishful thir-rking. As far as is_ known, he never kiled anybody,; o, .r* inflicted any p_articular harm on anyone (if superficiaf cuts'and bruises are discounted). -lompared with Peter Kiirten or Albert Fish, he was merely an unskilled amateur. He was too much the philosopher and the intellectual to givg himself undividedry to th. vioience he preached. And a great-deal of the nastin.rr of his writings was an attempt to ge! his own back on'society'. Today he would be\" laced on proba-ti-on and treated by a psychiatrist, and would probably be wel- comed by al-l the editors; in another fifty years his name would be as completely forgotten as that of Aleistei Crowley, instead of being a synonym for torture t46 147 [, {J:r"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":",\": :.: The no Days is largely a work of reaction against morality. He intensifies his pleasure in the acts he describes by speaking of them as 'abominable', 'vicious', 'loathsome'. The standards he is offending are always present to his mind; he never develops a positive phil- osophy of sexual freedom (as Blake does, for example) because he never ceases to blaze with resentment against Mrs Grundy, and can- express this resentment only by coniuring up scenes of pointless de- struction. He is always on the defensive. The rzo Days begins fairly quierly, with the brothel madams de- scribing scenes that, except for their overabundance of detail, would not be out of place tn Zola or in Kuprin's The Pit. The perversions become more and more startling - mainly because they soon lose all contact with sex. It would be easy to parody The vo Days, be- ginning: 'Take two sheets of brown paper ind the white of an €gg . . .' De Sade completed thirty of his hundred and fwenty days, and left a sketch summary of the rest. The unwritten part was to deal with the criminal passions, and included many recipes for murder. Some of them border on the comic - shooting people out of cannons, etc. - and much more is sheer nastiness, such as chaining a starving girl to a wall, placing a meal slightly out of her reach, giving her a large knife, and telling her that she must cut ofl her arm if she is to reach the meal. (De Sade overlooked the possibility that she might use the knife to reach the plate.) It has been argued that most of De Sade is not pornography; it aims at disgusting and horrifying rather than at titillating. His defenders claim that this entitles his work to be considered as serious literature. But although The no Days may be anything but sexually stimu- lating, it is a pathological document that never rises to the status of literature, even accidentally, Geoffrey Gorer's claim that the {our lib- ertines rank with the greitest charicters in fiction cannot be daken seriously. De Sade is the final argument against the'power of darkness'school of fantasy. He exaggerates its tendencies until they can all be recog- nised. His sexual fantasy aims at creating'evil'. He was too much of a rationalist to believe in black magic, or no doubt he would also have invoked the devil. He is a Gilles de Rais without religious faith, and therefore handicapped in feeling himself a sinner. He was intelligent, but his intelligence was crippled by his resentment, his feeling that he had been freated badly. But he often reasons acutely about sin and virtue; given enough time, or different circumstances, he might have ended by reasoning himself into genuine moral perceptidn, of the sort possessed by Dostoevsky. But for the resentment that stunted his moral growth he might have developed-Iike Stawogry in TJtg Deylls. In .Nifht Town', ]ames ]oyce caught all the essential qualities of De Sade j bhsphemy, indecenry and violence - and turned them into catharsis; tfiey aihieve an intensity that fuses_ them into literature. This intensity De Sade never achieved. Yet because he failed, he exposes the bankruptry of the simple 'good-andfYil' morality. He winted to 'do evil'; like Stawogin, he only succeeded in making him- self sick. '\\[ith the exception of Lovecraft, no writer ever tried harder than De Sade to coniure up the Powers of darkness; with the excep tion of Lovecraft, no writer made himself more absurd. It can be seen that most of the writers I have dealt with in this volume sufier from a milder form of De Sade's naive good-and-evil dualism. The sexual orgies of the puritanical spinster in Faulkner's Light in August follow the De Side formula; so does the corncob pelrversion o{sanctuary and its rape fantasy. }o1ce tries to settle his Quarrel with Catholiciim with an ecstasy of blasphemy.and indecency ir,'Night Town', and Beckett follows suit by making his characters in Endgime curse God. Greene also likes to associate sex with sin, and tries-hard to convince the reader that the.Devil exists because the world is sordid. The writers of supernatural fantasy declare that the I Devil exists because the world is a haunted and cmel place. AII are trying to deny the pragmatic position r-each._d by Tolstoy-and Dos- toevs[y: that evil iJonly the absence of good, absence of love. Leo- nardo'expressed the pragmatic position in his notebook 'Evil is physical pain.' \\(hen examined closely, this is seen to contain a com- ft.1. phiiosophical position. Leonardo is n9! lefi.(ng ew! as physical irain. The *.rtting-of the statement would be clearer if it were ex- |ressed in the form 'Physical pain is evil', i.e., physical pain is the only ivil that human beings can-know. Vith its implications _made ex- plicit: that the value of tlfe is such that nothing bulplysical pain can iregate it. Everything is good except physical Pritt-.This is the position ofihe Brotheis Kaiamizov. (Ivan goes even further at one point and declares that everything is good, including pain, but his general con- cern with cruelry hardly bears this out.) It is also the general existent- ialist position, from Nietzsche to Sarfre and Diirrenmatt. CONCLUSION This connection of the concept of evil with the imagination throwg some light on the nature of imlgination. De Sade wanted to create evil in reacfion against his loss of fieedom. Lovecraft achieved a catharsis r48 t49"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"from the oppressions of. a meehanised civilisation through 'evil'. A man who is oppressed - psychologically or physically - Las no free- dom; freedom can be gained only by objectlfying the oppression as evil. The moment the'evil'has been objectified (expressed), a degree of freedom has been obtained. Imagination is man's act of increasing his freedom. Its only enemy is the notion that man has no will. Its only limit is the conception of absolute freedom. NOTES r. Mr Patric Dickinson has pointed out to me the following quotation from Baudelaire: 'As for the ardour with which Poe often treats hor- rifying material, I have observed in a number of men that this was often the result of a very large fund of unirsed and vital energy, some- times the result of an unyielding chastify and of deep feelings kept repressed.' z. I am ignoring the possibility that the fear may have been a fear of wild beasts or snakes, not of ghosts. Elsewhere in the Nihaya, Gautama de- scribes plunging into a forest thicket that made his hair stand on end, and how he suMued the fear; in this place he is probably referring to the fear of wild beasts. I have used the account given in F. L. \\?'ood- ward's Some Sayings of the Buddha. 3. It would seem at times that Tolkien has Hitler in mind. Sauron's chief agents are the 'black riders', called the Nazguls, which seems too close to Nazis to be coincidence. 4. Although he was the direct cause of the accidental death of two prosti- tutes, who took an overdose of Spanish fly; for this, he was sentenced to death, but reprieved. Six Sex and the Imagination The most perfunctory study of. The no Days of Sodom reveals that imagination is the source of all sexual perversion. Durcet even says as much at one point: 'One grows tired of the co,rnmonplace, the im- agination becomes vexed, and the slenderness of our means, the weak- ness of our faculties, the corruption of our souls, leads us to these abominations.' De Sade has many other penetrating observations to make on the subiec[ for example, 'the idea of crime is able always to ignite the senses and lead us to lubricity'. This is not far from Zamia- tin's observation that crime and freedom are always connected. These ideas require some analysis: expressed in this w?1lr they are too vague to be meaningful. Aiter all, very few people feel t6d to lubriciry by the grime repo ts in their morning paper, and any habit- ual criminal might feel that crime and the idea of losing his freedom are always connected. To clarify this, it is necessary to refer to fwo episodes in Nietzsche's life. In a letter to Von Gersdorff, written when he was a student, Nietzsche tells how he climbed a hill, and took shelter from a storur in a hut in which a man was killing two kids. 'The storm broke with a tremendous crash .. . ?nd I had an indescribable sense of well-being and zest. .. . Lightning and tempest are different worlds, without moralify. Pure will, without the confusion of intellect - how happy, how free.' The second occasion occurred when Nietzsche was,a nurs- ing orderly in the Franco-Prussian war. One evening, in a state of fatigue, he walked towards a small town near Strasbourg. He heard the sound of approaching hoofbeats, and watched his old regiment riding past. Again he felt the same exhilaration, at the thought that these men were riding towards the battle, and wrote to his sister: '... the strongcst and highest will to life does not lie in the petty sfruggle to exist, but in the \\[ill to war, the \\Mi]l to Power'. Although these two passages express only an aspect of Nietzsche's philosophy, it is an aspect without which he cannot be understood. And De Sade's violent and blasphemous creation, the Duc de Blangis, was conceived in this Nietzschean spirit. (Blake also expressed it in the statemenfi 'Energy is eternal delight.') Nietzsche's ecstasy of the tempest, 'pure will, without the confusions of intellect', becomes the Duke's sexual ecstasy.l It is no doubt frue that there is an element of ,l r51 r50"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"nonserse in Nietzsche's talk about immorality. It should not be for- gotten, though, that the romantic temperament flinches from life and iejects it, thit it fries to substitute for {ving experierice a world of abstractions and imaginings. Nietzsche has overcome this extreme romanticism - stilI characteristic of German thought - and stands on the threshold of affirmation, a point at which distinctions are apt to be a little bluned. And De Sade, for all his silliness, is basically obsessed by the idea of 'men like gods'. He was a sensualist and l we3kling, and his contemporaries were right to put him in fail. But he also had the makings of a poet's vision, and his position,outside society- produced an unuzual d'epth of perception of the shortcomings of his- con- temporaries. His sufferings may have been deserved; lyt they *ttp- eoed hir criticism of hypocrisy, pettiness and sheer feeble-mindedness. He wanted to create a-figure iike Uilton's Devil (it is no accident that the tumescent duke is described as'heaven-threatening'); but Milton's Satan is a puritan, who never does anything that would have struck his creator-as disgusting or nasty. De Sade wants to horrify, to -con- vince the world that he possesses a courage beyond its understan_ding. The jailers of his later years described him as a well-behaved and gentlimanly figure whose only shortcoming was 'a persistent desire Ior lewd conveisation'.'We can imagine him trying to shock his jailer: .Now come, admit it - wouldn't you enioy slicing a virgin into four pieces?' and then chuckling over his dinner as the horrified man rushed off to report it to his superiors. De Sade, in fiort, was what Blake might have been if a persecution mania had arrested his development at the time of The Martiage of Heo.tten and Hell. He belongs to Sir Isaiah Berlin's 'hedgehog' cat- egory ('the hedgehog knorrs one thing; the-fox knows many');3n{ th.e oi. it iog he knew was that sex is obscurely connected with the 'g-od- Iike, in ,irrr. Everything else he knew was wrong - for example, that sociefy and pettin.ss \"r\" identical, and that therefore crime, the revolt againit society, is identical with the'godJike'. But the relation between sex and the imagination is not restricted to questions of sexual perversion. The two are so clos-ely interwoven tha^t it would almost be true to say that the sex life of human beings depends entirely on the imagination-. 11 Corydon Andr6 Gide argues thit it is only-in the lower animals that sex is a physical matter, depending on-the peculiar smell,of the female in heat; therefore, it is orrty ,*oig animals that 'normal' sexuality can be regarded as part of the\"order 6f nature'. The imagination of most human beings may be conditioned to regard the male-female relationship as'normal',-but since the imagit rEot is essentially free, this is no law of nature. Giile uses this argument to iustify his own homosexuality. He regarded Corydon as one of his most r{portant books; so far no critic has ever agreed \\\\rith him. And yet Gide was rigt-rt in his -higtt estimate of the liork, for he has stumbled on an idea whose implications for the psy- chology of imagination are immense. Human sexuality is full olpara- doxeJihat can only be explained in terms of imagination. In Doctor Faustus, Mann pointed out that the words of the marriage ceremony, 'These two shall be one flesh', are nonsense. Sex depends on the strangeness, the separateness, of the other 'flesh'. 'Oneness' would be the destruction of the sexual impulse. But what is the human faculty for perceiving'strangeness'? \\[hy does a certain picture arrest the attention when seen for the first time, and yet make no impact when it has hulg- on your wall {or six months? \\7hat happens when you read a whole page of a book with- out 'taking it in'? The faculty for 'grasping' a picture or a lnge of prose might be called the attention. But attention is a simple matter, depending on an act of will (as when a schoolteacher calls 'Pay atten- tion, pleaie'). This ordinary attention is often inadequate to grasp- the meaning of a picture or a piece of music; it is not'open' enough to allow afrrU and wide impact of strangeness. The instantaneous act of grasping, that franscends the pedestrian 'attention', is the im- iginition. It is rnole active than attention; it is a kind of exploriSg_ of t[e object, as well as a withdrawal from it to see it better. And this same act of exploration and withdrawal is the basis of the strangeness of sex. Yet although we might say that sex depends partly on the im- agination, it would be equally true to say that the imagination, in s&ual matters, is 'subsidised' by the sexual instinct. An irrational flow of vital energy stimulates the imagination; this flow might be described as the 'sexual shock', and it has much in common with the 'shock of recognition' that Edmund'Wilson has described as being the response to authentic artistic po,wer. The_ strength of the im-agination is iutomatically magnified by the sexual impulse. This is the reason that so many works of literature depend upon a sexual dwelopment to hold the ieader's attention; the imagination is 'subsidised'. Like Gide, Tolstoy recognised this relationship of sex to im- agination; unlike Gide, he was unwilling to acknowledge that, where sex is concerned, 'all things are lawful'. In The Kreutzet Sonata he attempts a compromise. The work is Tolstoy's sexual gospel - a curi- ously puritanical gospel. (It is difficult to understand why it was banned in Tsarist Russia.)

The peasantry are saved from immorality b11 lF. hardness of their lives; for them'-sex is closely connected with child- bearing. The aristocracy have nothing t_g 4o but cultivate their emotiois and sensibilities, and this normally leads to sex. (His wife began a love afratr with a young violinist' with whom- she_played Be-ethoven's Ninth Sonata.) Sex, Tolstoy thought, is not for pleasure, but for childbearing. In later li[e, he fought with his impulseto_make love to his wife, and wrote stories in which sex is the source of all evil. Sex for pleasure is perversion, according to Tolst-oy. It is ^true, of coirrse, that the imagination plays its qa_rt in all the basic hurnan activities. Boswell records that |ohnson ate like a pig, and preferred his meat strong and pungent, because he had starved so -much as a young mall. Here )ohnson's privation (if Boswell is to be believed) let the\"imagination io .oot..f itself with the idea of food. Then, ai with De Sade, ordinary food was inadequate to satisfy the overstimulated imagination; |ohnson had to wallow in food as De Sade wallowed in sex. (Lord Chesterfield said that fohnson'throws his meat anywhere but down his throat'.) In the same w\"!t a sense.of social underprivilege can produce al exaggerated preoccuPation_with social position (i.e., snobb.ry) as in the case of D. H. Lawrence. But a mrn rirwed without food, ls he staryes without money (the basis of social position). No man ever died from sexual starvation. Sex may mean the survival of the race, but it makes no difference to the sur- vival of the individual. No doubt this is the reason that some instinct of survival has intensified the sexual impulse in men through the imagination, so that the sexual appetite is as strong as the need for food. The power of the sexual impulse can be utilised like the cordite in a bullet,lo drive the projectile of the imagination towards new insights. It provides no insight in itself - only the power. This distinction should be clearly understood. The Power to project the imaginltign can come from many difierent sources. It may be connected with ill- health, and the sudden contrast of convalescence, as with Nietzsche and Pascal. Nietzsche conceived the idea of eternal recurrence in the exhilaration of convalescence, and wrote on a piece of paper'Six thou- sand feet above men and time'. Dostoevsky had his sudden visions of the value of life in epileptic fits; and again, when he thought he w_as about to be executed. Lovecraft and the 'horror writers' use the emotion of fear as the'cordite'. For the writers of fantasy, the driving force is wonder. Blake was right in emphasising the role of energy. The imagination is like an engine that can work on many different fuels; but it must be powered. And sex, Properly used, is a fuel of high potency. ' Th.e'Cloud. of lJnhnowinguses the image of a spark flying upwald to describe visionary insight. Some early religions used sex as the power to drive the'spark'. Even in fwellieth-century Russia, Rasputin ivrs , member of a sect called the Khlysty, whose rites involved a dionysiac dance that ended in promiscuous sex. It seems tltrt P{mi- tive people feel no conscience about associating religion-and sex. It is only-wlien notions of social morality !.gi\" to enter that sex is re- garied as an ally of the Devil. Hence t!9 dionysiac orgies of witches were associated with the Devil instead of God. 'William Blake was one of the first writers of modern Europe to revolt against the idea of sex as the Devil's province, and to attempt to restore it to its place as a fuel for visionary experience. There have since been four other European writers whose attitudes resemble Blake's; these are Maupassant, Vedekind, Artzybasheff and Law- rence. I propose to deal briefly with these in the remainder of this chapter. MAUPASSANT The name of Maupassant is associated with 'realism' and 'irony' rather than with sei. Yet eyery one of his important works, from the beginning to the end of his career, is dominated by'sex. An enolmous nrr*b.t of his two hundred and sevenfy short stories, as well as his six novels, are pivoted on sex. It would not be accurate to call Maup-assant a sexual mystic. And yet the intensity of his love of life entitles him to be called a poet, if not a mystic, and sex plays alatge palt in his vision of 'life'. This love of life is the source of Maupassant's greatness, and the source of his ultimate failure as an artist is his lack of intellect, of seH- analysis. He is the most completely brainless of all the great authors. He iccepted all experience without analysis, and his_final iudgments on life were shallow and pessimistic. But his immediate perceptions were of a very high quality indeed. In his eariiest-work, Maupassant seems ashamed to reveal the im- portance he attaches to the iexual imprrlse; his long story, 'Boule^ de Suif', and his first novel,lJneYie,lean heavily on the realist tradition of Flaubert and Zola, and are full of irony and pify'. AWoman's Life (the'usual English translation for IJneYie) is ab_out an innocent and idealistic 1'oung girl who marries a man whom she takes for a Prince L5' r54"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Charming. On the honeymoon, he reveals a pathologlcal meanness, and soon af.ter that she discovers that he is unfaithful. He is finally killed in the act of adultery by an outraged husband (who pushes the hut that conceals the lovers over a ravine). ]eanne now devotes her life to her son. He causes her as much pain as had his father, proving to be a profligate and a spendthrift. But when, at the end of the book, her son's child is brought home, |eanne's servant makes the observation: 'Life is never so good or so bad as people think.' Maupassant seems to take pleasure in emphasising that immoraliry is widespread. Even |eanne's mother has had a love afrair, which comes to light after her death. Maupassant himself was obsessed by sex. He lived for a time in a brothel, and contracted syphilis from one of his many casual pickups. But he was the son of a respectable family, and never ceased to be aware of 'moralist' opposition. (This is no doubt the reason that his early works play down i& and emphasise pity.) He is never apaganimmoralist,like \\Mhitman. But as soon as he found his feet as a writer, he began to express his own peculiar amoral vision of the world. The vision has something in common with Hem- ingway's. Maupassant loves physical reality (he was an athlete, a fine swimmer, and a lover of boats). His world has much in common with the world of the Impressionists and Van Gogh. It is all light and colour and sheer ioy in being alive. Sexual conquest is another of his chief sources of pleasure. He is keenly aware of violence and death, and knows that most human beings take little pleasure in being alive. His stories are full of porfraits of meanness and pettiness. An early story, 'The Shepherd's Leap', contains all his characteristics in embryo. Its narrator, who is spending the summer in Normandy, tells the story of how the 'Shepherd's Leap' came by its name. The village had once been governed by a fanatical and puritanical young priest; on one occasion, he was so disgusted to discover a crowd of children watching a bitch in labour that he kicked the animal to death and killed all the puppies. One day in a storm, when about to take shelter in a shepherd's wheeled hut, he realised that a young couple were making love in the straw. He slammed the door, and pushed the hut downhill, to be smashed in the ravine. (Ihis was, of course, the episode that Maupassant used again inUneYie.) Maupassant tells the story with typical 'detachment'; even in the horrible scene in which the dog is killed, there is no hint of disgust. He mentions that the young couple are still clasped together when their bodies are taken out of the wreck, 'in terror as in pleasure', hinting his delight in the act of physical love. And the description of the scenery leaves no doubt of his love of the countryside. So the only emotion that emerges from the story is pleasure. This combination of violence ,i: and delight gives many of his stories their curious effect of brutal loveliness, ruthlessness and beauty. And yet one feels that this detachment is not healthy.'W'hen Mau- passant describes how an old Corsican woman trained her dog to rip out the throat of her son's murderer, or how an avaricious Norman peasant woman frightened a sick woman to death by pretending to be the Devil, or how iNormandy fisherman was ro *.in that he allowed : a taut rope to sever his brother's arn rather than cut it and lose a net, the reader feels that Maupassant ought to feel horror and express it. Only a moral imbecile could refrain from feeling indignation when describing such episodes. Yet at other times, especially when writing : of sex, Maupassant's 'detachment' obviously hides an attitude of ap proval. There sometimes seems to be more than a touch of De Sade about Maupassant. One suspects that his master was not Flaubert, but Laclos, the author of Les Liasons Dangereuses, who described liber- tinage and moral dishonesty with ill-concealed delight. In one stor/, for example, Maupassant describes how a rake marries a beautiful imbecile girl for the sake of money; the girl's parents hope that mar- riage - and perhaps babies - will iure hei. Forihe first few days after the marriage, she seems comp,letely indifferent and unchanged. Then gradually she develops an attitude of dogJike devotion to her husband, and it is obvious that she associates him with intense pleasure. Finally he gets bored and leaves her, and she sits at the window for years afterwards, waiting for him to reappear - still like a dog. One needs to know very little about Maupassant to recognise a wish-fulfillment fan- tasy in this story (he takes care to state that the girl is very beautiful although it seems more'likely that, if she was a congenital imbecile, her lips would be loose and flabby, and she would probably dribble). It may be unjust to Maupassant to suppose that he took sadistic pleasure in the girl's betrayal, but it is at least certain that he was indifferent to it. (This was the period when George Moore could comment about one of Goya's nudes: ''What does it matter if a sixteen-year-old girl had to be debauched if the result is a masterpiece?') Th_e type of story that shocked Tolstoy - who did an excellent essay 'i;i on Maupassant - is less harmful. Maupassant enjoyed writing about ,,i seduction. One of his most delightful stories 'That Pig Morin' tells how a linen draper named Morin was tempted to kiss a pretfy girl on a i train, and how she screamed, and he was arrested for assault. The ,, ,' editor of a local newspaper went to call on the girl to persuade her to ,,'i drop the case, was charmed by her, and ended by sleeping with her. Maupassant's point is well made, that there are different ways of ':'. r56 r57"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"going about lovemakingr sortre of which Iead to success, and others to disaster. Maupassant has many stories that end in seduction with no harm done. fhey are what used to be called 'typically French', al- though their attitude to sex is no more French than it is Gerurarr or English; pleasure in seduction is not a national characteristic. (M-usil in fus MinWithout Qualities has exactly the same attitude to seduc- tion as Maupassant, and goes even further than Maupassant_ in in- cluding inceit.) A mildly sadistic element enters into the pleasure Maupassant takes in cuckolded husbands. In the novels, Maupassant's obsession with sex is unmistakable. A Votnan's Lr.fe mighp 5e regarded as an indictment of the_cruelty and immorality of men. But his next novpl, Bel-Arni, describes how an amiable sioundrel rises to prosperity through sheer luck and his love of women, and it would be blindness to regard it as a disapproving portrait. 'Our handsome friend' is a scoundrel in a purely Shavian ttlil?rrr-Oriol is the last of Maupassant's maior novels; the remaining three betray his breakdown. If centres around the seduction of a young marii.d woman at a French watering place. The subplot of the novel deals with the intrigues that cenfre around the new bath that is established at Enval; this reveals Maupassant in an unfamiliar light, as a writer of high comedy. But the main plot of the novel can be simply summaris.d: Christiane, the young married woman, is pursqed by Piul, a friend of her brother, and finally submits to him. This hippens halfway through the book. Then Paul slowly loses-ittere-stin hei, although she is carrying his child; after the birth of the child, Christiane ilso loses interest in Paul, having learned the Byronic lesson that 'Love is of man's life a thing apatt;'Tis woman's whole existence'. The basic feeling of the book is Maupassant's healthy male conceiq he enioys describing the seduction. Maupassant'i last three novels are uneven in quality. Pietre and lean isih. fittt that is simply a long-winded b_ore. Again, it deals with bne of Maupassant's favo-urite themes: the lu.ky and the ,rt lrr.-ky. Pierre and |ein are two brothers. fean is lighthearted,_happy-golucky, and his mother's favourite; Pierre, the elder, is brooding and serious- minded. Then an old friend of the family dies and leaves lean a large legacy. Pierre suspects that the man was his mother's lover and |ean's reil f-ather. Finally, he discovers this to be true, and violently accuses his mother, trying, like Hamlet, to make her feel her guilt. But nothing much happens; |ean gets engaged to the pretty,widow with whom tfrey are 6oth in love, and Pierre goes to se_a. |ean_arrd his mother are relieved to see him go. The book has no real point. Maupas- sant had already used its theme in a short story (where it is more zuccessful). He dwells at preposterous length on the mother's guilt; it seems curiou-s that Maupassant should make such a mountain out of a molehill of immoraliry,when so many of his other stories have made molehills out of mountains. Pierre's jealouqy and his mental torments are too protracted to hold the reader's attention. Having written about Pierre's discovery of his mother's guilt, it is obvious that Maupassant has no idea of how to finish his story; moreover, he has no idea of his attitude to his material. This is the dullest of all Maupassant's works. Notra Coeur shows a momentary return of the author's powers. It is told with his usual economy and vividness of style, and engages the reader's attention from the beginning. But it is a decadent world Mau- passant describes with open approval. Andr6 Mariolle is a rich bach- Elor, who allows himself to be taken to the salon of the beautiful Michele de Burne. He is determined not to be captivated by her, but is soon in love. Maupassant exercises all his usual ingenuify in keeping the reader waiting for the seduction scene which, of course, happens ultimately. Mariolle now becomes the woman's slave and lapdog; the situation of. Mont-Oriol is reversed; it is the woman who has the whip hand. Mariolle consoles himself somewhat by seducing a pretty ser- vant girl, and ffies hard to become master of himself again. But at a signal from Michele, he rushes back to her feet. So the book ends. It seems to be the beginning of a defeat complex in Maupassant, com- pletely unlike the attitude of Bel-Ami. The difference is as striking as that between Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise andTender Is the Night. All the optimism has evaporated, and Maupassant tries to make a virtue of despair. After Pierre etlean, Maupassant's last novel, AsStrongasDeath,is the weakest of the series. Oliver Bertin is a rich and successful painter, who has had for many years a love affair with Anne, Countess de Guilleroy. In a flashbaik revealing all his old power, Maupassant telli how the liaison began, how they became lovers, although the Coun- tess was a virtuous wife, and Bertin was no seducer. The remainder of the book tells how Bertin comes to realise that he has fallen in love with his mistress's daughter, Annette. But Maupassant has none of the delicary that makes Thackdray's treatment of a similar theme in Henry Esmond so successful. Bertin's sleepless nights and orgies of self-pity are as boring as Pierre's in the earlier novel. The book might have been turned into a success if Maupassant had attempted to show the complexities involved in winning Annette's affections; but he does nothing of the sort; Bertin loves gloomily and despairingly, and no one-is sorry when he gets himself killed in a street accident at the end. l, lil ' ii I .

And it does it badly.2 The reason for Maupas,sant's breakdown was approaching insanity due !o syphilis, and probably complicated by alcoholic poisofung. This can be seen most clearly in the horror stoiy 'The Hoih', iD wLich a man is haunted by some kind of invisible monster. But even without syphilis, the seeds of madness were already present in Maupassant's rr,rental make-up, in the'!7'eltanschauung of a man who could declare that cruelfy and violent death are as muih the order of nature as love and beauty. Morality, alter all, is a direction that we give to the world, 1 kild of grain that we profess to see in the wood of experience. W'ithout some such conviction, there can be no evolution of the per- sonality, for there is no sense of purpose on which the will can take its stand. Maupassant's early works are full of a sense of meaning, but it has not been put there by Maupassantl it is simply a reflection of a sup-remely healthy llving o gairism. Like Van Gogh, he is affirming w_ithout knowing why, affirming in spite of misery and death. But Maupassant_n_ever used his brain, he never tried to gain permanent possession of this knowledge by turning it into ideas and convictions. So when his sickness robbed him of it, he had nothing; there was nothing he c_ould do in his work but imitate the old gestures. Again one is reminded of Hemingway. Maupassa-nt ended by becoming completely insane, arid committing suicide. In the ten years of his creative life, he had written more than most writers achieve in a long life. He wrote very quickly, and this p tq. right way to read him. Critics who carefiillt ana[yse one of his short stories: say TheNecklace - and then solemnly deilare it as a masterpiece are doing him an injustice. Taken on their own, none of his short stories are great. They should be swallowed in dozens, like oysters; this is the only way to get the true Maupassant flavour. The impression that em-erges then is of incredible vitalify, the 'great health' that Nietzsche spoke about when creating Zqrithustra.l,nd an important part of this health is Maupassant's immense delight in sex: Maupassant treated sexual experiences like oysters. \\TEDEKIND 'Wedekind's Christian names, ironically enough, were Beniamin Franklin, but he preferred to shorten this to Frink. He was b6rn in t864 in Hanover, and died in r9r8, so that his literary career is roughly contemporaleo}s with Ibsen, Bjcirnson, Brieux and Srrindberg. Consequently, his name is seldom mentioned in England or Americi, except as an afterthought to Ibsen and Strindberg.s This is unfair; \\Tedekind is also a 'sexual philosopher', and his nearest literary rela- tive is Nietzsche. Vedekind was born of a theatrical family - his mother was an actress and his father a doctor, a domineering, violent man. He grew up in Switzerland, preferred a wandering life, was fascinated by cir- cuses (one of his mistresses was an acrobat) and criminals, and worked as a journalist and an advertising manager before he became an actor and producer of his own dramas. At the age of thirty-five he spent some time in prison, having been charged with insulting royalty in some political poems published in a satiricalmagazine. The remainder of his life was not particularly hrppy. Some of his plays were a success, but he was constantly being charged with indecency. A sketch of his life slory gives the impression that,like Poe, he was born unlucky. His family was noted for eccentricity and internal feuds (Gerhart liaupt- mann is said to have portrayed their quarrels in his early play The Peace Festival). One of his brothers committed suicide. \\fedekind him- self was lame from birth. In his work as a cabaret artist, singing his own cynical political ballads to tunes of his own, he anticipated the \\Meill-Brecht collaboration of twenty-five years later. His fame was brief; when he died in r9r8, he was prematurely old, and considered out of date by the new German Expressionists. (\\7'edekind is usually regarded as a Symbolist,like the later Strindberg.) The earliest scandal associated with'Wedekind's name followed the first performance of his drama The Awahening of Spring, when he was only fwenty-seven. This play deals with the sex lives of ado- lescents, and already states Wedekind's main contention - that the most important impulse in human lifp is the erotic impulse, and that our society is based on the suppression of this fact. If. \\fledekind had known Barbusse's L'Enfer, he would have approved of the scene in which someone tells about the rape and murder of a little girl, and the respectable bourgeois listeners lick their lips and try to conceal their excitement. The Awakening of Sprirlg owes its technique of short scenes to Biichnef s Vozzeck. '!7'edekind is concerned to try to pre- sent the sexual torments of adolescence with complete honesty. His hero, Melchior, is a brilliant schoolboy, who is conversant with'the facts of life'. His friend Moritz and the schoolgirl 'Wendla are less well-informed. Melchior writes an account of human sexuality and gives it to his friend, who conceals it in some schoolbooks. Moritz commits suicide because he is about to fail his exams, and Melchior's sex notes are found in his books. It is also discovered that the fourteen- year-old Wendla is pregnant, and that Melchior is responsible. s-TsrD-B 16r r6o"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"'Wendla dies, from an abortion.

Goll is iealous, and when one day he finds his wife in a compromising position with a painter, he collapses in rage, and dies of heart failure. LuIu then marries the painter, who sees in her an incar- nation of the eternal woman. Lulu continues to see as much as she cair of her original benefactor, Dr Sch<in, who finds her presence embar- rassing: he has got himself engaged to a young girl and is afraid that someone will discover his intrigue with Lulu and ruin his en- gagement. He decides to talk to the painter, tell him a few home iruths about his wife, and advise him to keep Lulu at home. The painter is shattered by the revelations about his wife. He believed she was an orphan. Now he learns that the disgusting old beggar who calls is aCtually her father (even Sch<in does not know that the beggar was Lulu's lover), that Lulu is not an angel of purity; he shoots himself. Lulu now goes on the stage, and plots how to make Dr Schtin marry her. She is acting in a play for which Schtin's son Alva com- posed the music. Alva is also in love with her. One night, Sch<in is foolish enough to come to the theatre with his fianc6e. Lulu has a fainting fit on'stage and has to be carried off to her dressing room. Schon follows her there in a rage, certain that she is shamming because she refuses to dance in front of his fianc6e. Now Lulu uses all her charm and vitalify; Schon finds it impossible to resist. At her dictation, he writes a letter to his fianc6e, breaking with her, and marries Lulu. Sch<in is the only man Lulu has ever loved. And yet Lulu is easily bored, and she still has crowds of admirers, including a lovesick schoolboy, a lesbian countess, and Sch<in's son. Alva continues to be fascinated by her even when Lulu admits to him that she poisoned his mother. Schrin is frantically jealous of her. There is a comedy epi- sode, in which Lulu makes various lovers hide behind curtains as more lovers arrive. Schon sees his own son making love to her, and threat- ens her with a revolver. Lulu replies coolly: 'If men have killed them- selves for my sake, that does not lower my value ... You betrayed your best friends with me . . . I have,never pretended to be other than I was taken for. And no one ever took me for anything but what I am.' (This is an interesting admission, for everyone takes her for something quite different.) As Sch<in is about to shoot her, she manages to get 164 the revolver and shoot him. Sch<in, as he dies, tells his son: 'Don't let her escape. You will be the next.' Lulu's arrest for murder ends Earth Spirit. Between this, and the beginning of Pandora's Box, Lulu spends ten years in prison. She is finally rescued through a plot. The lesbian countess, who is devoted to her, has deliberately contracted cholera, given it to Lulu in prison, and then helped Lulu to escape from the prison hospital. An athlete who wants to marry her is driven away when Lulu pretends to be a ravaged cholera victim. As soon as Lulu is left alone with Alva, she radiates beauty and health again. They sing a love duet and she becomes Alva's mistress on the same settee on which Alva's father had died. The remainder of the play shows Lulu's downfall; instead of being the seductress, she is now the victim. She escapes to Paris \\Mith Alva, and a white slave trafficker tries to force her to enter a brothel.B She flies to London, and moves to 'Whitechapel, where she becomes a pros- titute to support Alva and the old beggar. The lesbian countess turns up too. Her last customer is fack the Ripper, who murders her and the countess, who tries to protect her. The above description may make the plot appear complicated; the two plays are in fact more complicated. Yet the figure of Lulu domi- nates and unifies them. The prologue declares that Lulu was created to 'bring evil, to attract, to seduce, to poison, to murder so that it cannot be felt'. In spite of this, Lulu's most striking quality is her innocence and good faith. She personifies the fire in 'The Burning of Egliswyl'; it is not her fault if moths find her irresistible. Alva tells her: 'With your divine gifts, you furn all those around you into criminals without being a\\Mare of it.'Again there is the same connection between crime, sex and freedom. But only Alva, the artist, is aware of her true natute. And, contrary to Schon's prediction. Alva survives her. 'W'edekind obviously identified himself with Alva (as did Alban Berg in his opera). \\Medekind wrote many more studies of women, as well as of the artist; none of these need be examined at length in this context. Effie, in Cqstle W etterstein, also makes prostitution her career, and dies at the hand of a pervert. The heroine oI Franziska is a kind of female Faust who experiments compulsively with sex; strangely enough, '\\7'edekind permits her a huppy ending in domestic love. In King Nicolo, 'Wedekind treats the artist as a fallen king whose majesty is inalienable, even though he has to become the court jester. (Here, no doubt 'Wedekind was hitting back at the charge of.lbse-majestd that had landed him in iail; it was written immediately after his release.) In his best comedy, TheMarquis of Keitb, 'Wedekind writes vrith hurnor- t65"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"ous approval of a confidence swindler.? At the end of the play, the swindler's plans having collapsed, his successful rival oflers him the choice between a revolver and a small sum of money; he grins and takes the money. Here, as in The Avahening of Spring, 'W'edekind implies that life is the greatest value of all, and that only a fool would conrmit suicide. Altogether, 'Wedekind's work is unique. As an artist, he may lack the warmth and humanify of D. H. Lawrence, but his sexual vision is. in every way clearer. No other European writer has paid such homage to the sexual urge. He exalts it, not as the 'solar plexus' or 'the dark forces', but as the most naked expression of the powerhouse, the force of life. Spiritually,'Wedekind is Nietzsche's twin brother; neither can be understood without the other. ARTZYBASHEFF Artzybasheff's Sanine has a unique distinction; no other famous novel has been slighted so consistently. Prince Mirsky dismisses Ar- tzybasheff as 'a curious and on the whole regrettable episode in the history of Russian literafure'. Artzybasheff came to notice for the first time at the age of twenty-six with a short story about a life of 'search for truth' followed by , meaningless death. His Tales of the Re^ro- lution (the unsuccessful rgo5 revolution, of course) pleased the radical' public. The Russia of the last Tsar was a decadent, disillusioned country, dominated by the strange figure of Rasputin. Its most popular writer was the pessimistic Andreyev (although Gorki made a close second). The symbolist Briussov was Russia's foremost poet. A new religious mysticism was rising, inspired by Dostoevsky. Rozanov, Dostoevsky's greatest disciple, wrote conservative articles over his own name, and radical articles over a nom de plume, declaring that politics was nonsense anyway. Merezhkovsky wrote novels about warring antitheses - Christianity and paganism, the spirit of the flesh, and so on - and was the idol of the avant-garde. Artzybasheff specialised in descriptions of murder, rape and suicide in Tales of the Revolutioa. (Eisenstein's film caught faithfully his atmosphere in describing the Potemkin mutiny.) His novel Saninehad been reiected in Lgol, the publishers feeling that it was too philo- sophical, and perhaps indecent, After the revolution, Sanine appealed to the mood of rynicism and disaster, and the book swept Russia. There was already a tendency to sexual promiscuity among students in the capitals; Sanine extended it to every corner of Russia. t66 The book is by no means as badly written as many of its critics make out; it is nearly as readable as Maupassant. The young student Sanine returns to his provincial town and the company of his mother and sister. He has taken part in some revolutionary activities; but unlike most of his contemporaries, he is healthy-minded and indifferent to moral taboos. His indifference often reminds the reader of Dos- toevsky's Stavrogin, but Sanine loves life and takes it for gralted. The plot of the book is devised to demonstrate the effectiveness of Sanine's good-natured, Iaissez-faire attitude to life. His beautiful sister Lida has iwo suitors, a shy doctor and a brutal army offi.cer, Sarudin, who seduces her. 'When she discovers she is pregnant, she is about to commit suicide, but Sanine dissuades her, convinces her that things are not so bad after all, and persuades the shy doctor to marry her. Later, Sarudin calls at their house to show off his ex-mistress to a friend, and Sanine orders him to leave the house. Sarudin challenges Sanine to a duel, but Sanine regards these. military ideals of 'honout' as outdated, and refuses. Later, he meets Sarudin in a public garden, and Sarudin tries to provoke him to a duel by attacking him with a riding crop. Sanine promptly knocks him down and blacks his eye. Sarudin goes almost insane at the humiliation of being struck publicly by a man who coolly refuses to fight him, and commits suicide. - There are many other characters in the book, and several sub-plots. There is a gloorny sfudent named Yuri, who spends a lot of time brooding on whether life is worth living. Yuri falls in Iove with a girl named Sina, who returns the feeling. Instead of marrying the girl, Yuri broods on the futility of human life and commits suicide. Again, it is the healthy-minded Sanine who actually seduces Sina. After Yuri's death, Sanine is asked to say a few words by his grave. He comments: 'Another fool less in the world,' and horrifies everyone. There are two more deaths in the book; a consumptive student, Semenov, dies in hospital, and Sanine's healthy indifference to death becomes apparent. And a |ewish revolutionary, Soloveitchik, feels that life is futile and commits suicide. He is an idealist who is drawn to the Christian idea that this world is a vale of sorrow and should be renounced. Sanine tells Soloveitchik a story that perfectly illustrates his Nietzschean attitude. He had a Christian friend called Lande who showed an amazing capacity for self-sacrifice. (Lande had already turned up in Artzybasheff's Tolstoyan first story.) One day a fellow student hit Sanine when Lande was standing nearby. Sanine looked at Lande, and felt ashamed to hit back; he turned and walked away. But later he began to feel that the 'moral victory' was false; he had gratified the belligerent student. Sanine chose the next opporfunity t67 s !"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"',1 for a quarrel, and thrashed the student until he became unconscious. Lande was displeased, but Sanine felt a great deal better. Soloveitchik assures Sanine he is wrong and that Lande was right. He ends the conversation by asking Sanine whether a man who finds no ioy in living should commit suicide. Sanine replies unconcernedly: 'You are already dead. The best place for you is the grave,' and leaves him to commit suicide. At the end of the book, Sanine leaves the town - pursued by the moral fury of his fellow townspeople - and catches the train. He tires of the foul, smoky atmosphere of the train and, as the dawn rises over the steppe, jumps off, leaving his belongings behind, and stands there enjoying the dawn on the open fields. It will be seen that Sanine is a somewhat exaggeruted translation of Nietzsche and Blake into terms of fiction. It is not entirely true, how- ever, to the spirit of Nietsche. Sanine's last thought as he jumps off the train is: What a vile thing man is. To get away ... And the amoralism of the book may seem a little overdone. There are even traces of an incest theme between Sanine and his sister. The seduction of Sina by Sanine must be one of the most unconvincing seduction scenes in literature; it takes place in a small boat, and its purpose is obviously to prove that Sanine has no qualms about sex, while his friend Yuri is working himself into a mood of suicidal despair about whether he should take Sina's virginity. Artzybasheff's vision of sex lacks the intensity of 'Wedekind's, and his novel is not quite successful in making its points. These points were: visionary affirmation of life at all costs, condemnation of suicide, reiection of social codes of morality and 'honour', and a Bla. keian delight in sex as a basis for affirmation. Artzybasheff had begun as a disciple of Tolstoy; Sanine was his declaration of inde- pendence. But he seemed to be unsure of where his amoralism was leading him. The condemnation of suicide disappears in his later novels, andThe BreakingPoint seems to imply that suicide is the only honest reaction to life. It is about an epidemic of suicides that destroys aII the 6lite in a small town, and its hero, Naumov, talks about 'de- stroying in man the superstition of life'. From Nietzsche, Ar- .tzybashefr. seems to have turned to Schopenhauer a curious evolution. He continued to treat sexual problems with the same atti- tude of biological eroticism (that gives him so much in common with Vedekind), in novels and plays: The Millionaire, lealousy and The Iaw of the Savaga. The Bolsheviks expelled him from Russia in tgz3, and he died four years later an embittered man whose vogue had passed. On the whole, his finest novel isSanine, which deserves a place r68 as a minor classic; in it, he achieves a sense of the open air, of healthy optimism, that had been absent from Russian literature since Aksa- kov. D. H. LAWRENCE Lawrence's sexual mysticism is completely unlike that of the other writers I have dealt with in this chapter; it is altogether more per- sonal. W'edekind, like Blake, seemed to conceive sex as a thing in itself, a power beyond human personality. For Lawrence, it can never be separited from human personality. Lawrence's tragedyis similar to Maupassant's. He was no thinker; he never tried to raise his vision of life to an analytical level. But the advantage of intellect is that it can at least place concepts beyond the reach of fluctuating human emotions, separate the pure from the impure, the Permanent from the fortuitous. Like Maupassant, Lawrence became sick and embittered, and his original vision darkened. Lady Chatterley's Lover is only an ugly parody of his early vision of sex. His complete reliance on his own emotions and instincts gave him no yardstick to measure change of attitude. His novels are supposed to express a basically optimistic viewpoint; but the works of his last eight years are Pervaded by an afmosphere of gloom and futility that can be paralleled only by the latet Artzybasheff or Andreyev. In many ways, Lawrence's best work is similar to Maupassant's in its sensation of impressionism, of love of nature; it differs from Maupassant's in its love of people. But Lawrence's love of people is also his weakness, for in his later work it turns to a negative distaste. His work is dominated by personality in a way that the work of Maupassant and'Wedekind is not. It contains always two extremes, and the reader can never cease to be aware of them: the instinctive life affi.rmation of a poet, and the torments and complications of human relationships. Shiw admitted that he had tried to rlad Sons andLovers but'had been unable to finish it. No one who knows Shaw's work can be surprised at this; he must have found it all too personal, lacking in the attempt at objective communication. 'In his preoccupation with personal relationships, Lawrence is re- lated to the Aldous Huxley of.Point Counter Point, or to the novels of Angus'Wilson. He is not above his characters, detached from them, moving them around like pieces on a chessboard; he is down among them, reacting to them as a human being reacts to other human beings - with affection, irritation, boredom, interest.

Lawrence's basic #eakness is revealed in his short novel The ManlVho Died, in which |esus comes back from the dead, realises the error of his ways, the futili.ty or r.i\"j , *\"ria- betterer, and finds fulfilment in a sexual relation.

But there is too much disgust in La#rence for him to be convincing. Even at the end of the novel, when ]ezus steals' aboat, Lawrence cimments: 'The oars were yet warm with the unpleasant warmth of the hands of the slaves., This element of disgust is important in Lawrence,s work, but it would be unfair to pretend that it is always present.

To understand how well it can be done, ope should read Arthur schnitzler's short novel Casanova's Horneconing preferably af.tet reading the six volumes of Casanova's memoirs casanova taices the same gleeful delight as Maupassant in describing his conquests.

But when she sees him in the morning, she is horrified and disguited, and casanova re alises that he is an old and wrinkled libertine. outside the girl's window, he fights the young officer and kills him, then returni to Venice, where he sinks to the level of a spy. The book is an overwheLn- ing postscript to the famous Memoirs. 3. wedekind quarrelled with Strindberg in Paris and later lived with Strindberg's second wife, Frieda. 4. '\\Teisgall brings this out cleverly in his brilliant opera; the only heroic and tuneful aria is the one in which Gerardo tells his servants how to fold clothes. 'Packing clothes is quite an art,' he sings, with the lyricism that Tristan bririgs to the love duet. 5. This story is contained in a volume called Feuerwerk (rgo5), which has a famous preface 'on the Erotic'. The preface, however, is of less interest than one might suppose; it is wedekind's attempt to iustify himself in t!'e eyes of the- bourgeoisie. So insfead of containing an attempt to ex- plain his sexual mysticism, it speaks of the social importance of sexual frankness. It has the characteristic phrase 'flesh has iti own spirit', and spea\\s of the discussion of sex as a 'gymnastic of the spirit,. It would hardly seem out of place as an introduction to Mrs warien's profesnon or Ibsen's Ghosts. ,,} i: ,,0-llr I .t:1,\\ : lil.; i.,: i:t ii :''fi 1r 174 17,"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"6. \\tredekind wro0e another play, Dancc of Death, trafficker, Casti-piani, that ends in his suicide. 7. \\(edekind based his character on a forger of Gretor, whom he characteristically admired. about this white slave paintings named \\[illy - Seven The Need for Polarities It is necessary at this point to try to define more precisely the function of imagination. In its usual connotation, as I said earlier, imagination means the power of_creating images of something not actually present. If I con- centrate hard enough, I can create an image of my friend Bill sitting rl the empty chair opposite my typewriter. If I happen ro be leading a frustrating _and unlappy life, and I spend my -time coniuring up heroic daydreams, like Thurber's 'W'alter Mitty or \\[ells's Hoop Driver, the result may be a complete dislocation from 'everyday re- aJity', In so far as it obstructs my natural evolution as a sociil being, this dislocation will be dangerous, and a marxist critic wilt rightly refer to it as'escapism'. But it is obvious that the function of the imagination is not restric- ted to compensating for frustrations. 'Escapism' is an accurate descrip- tion when there is no connection befween the image and 'everyday life'; and even then there is room for argument about what constiiutes a connection. For in the ordinary w?1lr the function of imagination is to foresee the future and to enlarge the present consciousness. The imagination may 'see' a very l<lng way indeed, until its vision has no kind of connection with the everyday life of the subiect. Heinrich Schliemann was a wholesale merchant who dreamed all his early life of Troy. In his late forties he gave up business and went to look for the ruins of Troy - zlLd found them, nine buried cities, one on top of the other. It would seem, then, that the only way of judging between Schliemann and'Walter Mitty is to apply the pragmatic test; and this is always a half measure. It is more interesting to ignore definitions and consider the work- ings of the imagination. Although it may be true to say that too much imagination makes for inefficiency in practical affairs, the opposite may be equally true. Everyone has noticed the power of the im- agination over the body. You may be tired in the evening; you try to grapple with a volume of philosophy, or even a crossword plzzle, and your _eyes refuse to stay open; no matter how hard you try to bully your body into staying awaker 1zou drift towards sleep. On the othCr hand, you pick up a book that touches the imagination, and six hours later you realise that it is after midnight and you are willing to read t77 t76"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"on for another hour. The body may be difficult to bully into sub- mission, but it is easily charmed by the imagination. And when 'charmed', its effi.ciency is increased in every way. The explanation would seem to be that the imagination is the de- tonator of the will. \\Vhen connected with a purpose - which is necessary in the future - it can arouse the will. The more distant the purpose, the greater the power of the imagination. The need to solve a crossword puzzle is too immediate, its implications are too narrow, its connection with the evolution of the individual too limited. The imagination, then, is a machine that must work on fuel; its fuel may be any spontaneously generated energy: fear, love, lust, jealousy, wonder, ambition. The difference in quality of imagination between a great artist and the 'ordinary man' is that the artist has learned to generate large quantities of fuel, and to use them to drive the im- agination. If I merely imagine that my friend Bill is sitting opposite me, I am using the ordinary, conscious energy of the brain to main- tain the image.'When I cease to use it, the image will fade instantly; it has no life of its own. On the other hand, if I am sexually frustrated, I may conjure up an erotic scene that has enough reality to induce sexual excitement. Stories of the desert fathers, who deliberately re- pressed the sexual impulse, reveal that sexual images often- possess a power that seems independent of will - to such an e_xtent that many believed they were being tempted by demons in the shape of real women. In the same way, many artists have complained that their characters seem to develop a will of their own. (Pirandello's story'A Character in Distress'is a good example.) Even more to the point is the curious story of Shelley that is fre- quently told in connection with the genesil of. Ftanhenstein. Shelley and Mary Shelley, Byron and Polidori, all decided to write ghost stories. Mary was the only one who finished her task. But one evening when they were discussing ghosts, and Byrot Yas reciting lines of 'Christabei', Shelley uttered a shriek and rushed out of the house. Later, he explained that he had been staring at Mary when he had remembered-an old story about a woman who had eyes instead of nipples; the image was so powerful that he mistook it ff'r reality. In ,orr. of these cases need it be assumed that the imagination actually took on a life of its own. But the imagination fuelled b-y the energy-of fear, or by sexual enelgy, may work at an intensity that is unknown to the ordinary conscious image-making imagination. Drivers of old cars who change to a new, fast car have similarly re' corded the sensation that the car is running away with them. The fundamental and undeniable fact about the imagination is that its purpose is to intensify the life in man. Left to itself, life makes for stasi$ fust as the process of nature make for equilibrium, as a rolling stone finally comes to rest. On a long train iourney, the traveller first of all watches the passing scene and reflects on it; then he merely observes passively; finally, unless a stimulus is applied, he probably falls asleep - even passive consciousness disappears. These are the three stateS of consciousness familiar to most of us: the body's con- sciousness, which is maintained in sleep, the ordinary observant consciousness, and the reflective consciousness. This reflective consciousness is already close to the imagination, for you may forget to observe and become lost in reflection, which is a type of im- agination, fuelled by intellectual curiosity. But man also aims at pos- sessing a fourth type of consciousness, which is far wider than ordinary reflection. Reflection is like a train that runs on two narrow rails; it has to be reflection about something and that 'something' is normally immediate experience. .So. reflection runs on railway lines that sfretch from the past into the future. But the fourth type of consciousness aims at another type of exten- sion, a third dimension of awareness of other times and other places. Its instrument is memory, which has stored up all kinds of knowledge in the brain cells. This knowledge is dead unless it is illuminated by consciousness. In a sense, it might be said that every human brain possesses all hnowledge; for as well as its actual memories, it also possesses powers of reason that can relate these memories and produce new pieces of knowledge. A simple illustration is given in Plato's Meno, where Socrates proves that an ignorant slave already has a knowledge of geometry by persuading him to reason out a geometrical problem. Yet it would be more accurate to say that each brain has a capacity for all knowledge, rather than the possession of it. '!V.ells's comments at the beginning of the Experiment in Autobiography are profoundly perceptive. If we ask why men would rather sit and bite their nails than turn their attention inward and convert some of their immense store of potential knowledge into acfual knowledge, the answer is that men are only accustomed to bother about the knowledge that they require for survival. And 'Wells suggests that a new type of man is appearing, who wants a third dimension of imaginative con- sciousness for its own sake, not for his survival.

V'ells had already hinted that he suspected the 'men of imagination' were a new species, or at least an_important variation on the old species, as distinct as the first amphibians from the fishes that preceded them. Is it not possible that such men as'W'ells and Proust arebn the brink of a new stage in human evolution? There can be no possible doubt that the imagination is almost-synonymous with freedbm - as synonymous, at least, as 'atr' and 'wind'. Im- agination is man's atiempt to break out of the-prison of his body to porsess an extension beyond the present. But if imaginatiot it mean' ingless unless defined in terms of freedom, freedom is also mean- ingless unless defined in terms of evolution. Under pain or repression, *J *ry think of freedom simply as a desirable state, like breathing. But onie we cease to measure freedom in this negatiYe w?!t it becomes a question of evolution. Freedom is either freedom from something or freedom for something; it cannot exist statically. But there .rn c.rt\"inly be no doubt that the general notion_ of evolution is always connelted \\llith the imagination. Anyone who has ever conceived alarge work of construction or creation recognises the sense of freedom thit comes with grandiose plans. Can we doubt that one of Zola's greatest moments was the hour when he conceived the Rougon-Macquart rycle? Or that Newton - expe_rienced his deepest satisTaction when diiconnected fragments of mathematics and physi- cal observation began to cohere into the material of the Principw? This activity of planning a large work is not in itself an exercise of the imaginatior, b,rl it is a preparation for a Iong iourney_ aw-ay from lhe phyiical actuality of the piesent, and therefore a kind of practice for inhabiting a new field of consciousness. The followers of Flaubert believed that 'the artist'has no business with'convictions' or general ideas. 'Writers as unlike as Maupassant, Henry |ames, George Moore and |ames |oyce- subscribed to this dictum.'Admittedly, these writers did not insist that an artist should have no directio.r; ihey believed that'life'can provide all the direction an altist needs. The classic algument on the theme developed between Henry |ames and H. G.'Wells as a res,ult of the publication of 'Wells's satirq Boon,, ]ames protesting that all the artist needs il ,1r lappetite for life'. FinnLgansVahe reveals the bankruPtry of this belief; stuffed with curiosity about history, philosophy and human beings, it is a mausoleum oi 'life', a collection of materials for a great novel that was never written. Like freedom, the 'appetite for life' cannot exist with- out direction. It should be noted that |oyce, Maupassant and ]ames all emerged from a prisonlike adolescence with a ravenous ap-petite {or 'life'ind freedom; like prisoners, they were inclined to believe that r8z 'life' and freedom can have a static and independent existence. The results of this view can be seen in their later works. |ames's favourite theme is the tragedy of the undirected 'appetite for life'; in his early novels - Roderich Hudson, The Portrait of a Lady - he shows young people with a zest for living but no idea of what to do with it; in his own later work, the same need for evolution was forced to express itself in the language, which becomes increasingly involved. |oyce's case is identicdl, and I have already spoken of Maupassant's failure to develop. The point about these writers is that one cannot imagine how they could have continued to write if they had lived. Their 'am- oralism' precluded the possibility of a development in the realm of . ideas. But the need for some kind of development is obsessive in an artist. It comes easiest to the writer who finds it natural to express ideas - Dostoevsky, Mann, Hesse, Shaw. Other artists content them- selves with merely reflecting their personal development in their work - usually either an increasing mellowness (as in Shakespeare) or de- featism (Maupassant,Fitzgerald). This type of artist tends to take his work rather casually, and concentrate on living. But the serious artist who strives for development but tries to avoid ideas or convictions is usually forced to allow his style to carry the full weight of his craying for evolutionary complexity. The later |oyce, |ames and Meredith all have their fervent admirers; but for some leason, posterity usually seems to feel that the size of the kernel hardly justifies the efort required to crack the nut. My conclusion is that artistic development is associated with a cer- tain ievolutionary preoccupation'. No artist can develop without in- creasing his self-knowledge; but self-knowledge supposes a certain preoccupation with the meaning of human life and the destiny of han. A definite set of beliefs - Methodist Christianity, for example - may only be a hindrance to development; but it is no more so than Beckett'i refusal to think at all. Shaw says somewhere that all intelli- gent men must be preoccupied with either religion, politics or sex. (He ieems to attribute T. E. Lawrence's tragedy to his refusal to come to grips with any of them.) It is hard to see how au artist could hope to ichieve any degree of self-knowledge without being deeply concerned with at least one of the three.

Flaubert remarks contemptuously that Emma Bovary's hus- band soon began to treat sex as a kind of dessert after his dinner. According to ihe usual interpretation, Charles Bovary was in the g-rip of sexual illusions when he courted Emma, and soon discovered that the'reality' of sex is something far less exciting;_and Emma's t-ragedy was her inability to accept 'reality', her need to live in the im- agination. But ii dullness synonymous with reality? The- so-called 'sixual illusions' arc part of man's evolutionary appetite. The excite ment of sex is the initinctive craving to increase the complexity and intensity of life. 'When Charles BovalY first saw Eq*1 he-was a-r*Jy aware of he, as the prototype of all women, and therefore of the implications of her womanhood, of her involvement in the evolution- arf pro..ss. If intimate knowledge of her personality and her body deitroyed this instinctive awareness, then he had certainly not moved towards reality but away from it. It is natural that thii broader awaleness should fade, and give way to a narrower and more solidly defined consciousness. It was also natu- ral that Emma should need more love affairs, to attempt to restore her own broader awareness. Many highly imaginative people seem to re- quire a multiplicity of sexual experience {or this reasor. (H.- -G. 'W'.ttr is an exJmple.) But the need for multiple experience is in itself a failure of the imagination. To recognise this is to move towards a more precise definition of imagination, and to rec-ognise that the relafion of imagination to experience is identical with the relation o! Iogic to 'fact-s'. Socrates showed that the slave already possessed the 'facts' necessary to understand Pythagoras's theorem, but had not used his logical ficulty to relate them. H. G. 'Wells must certainly have pos- selsed the experience necessary for a profound understanding of women, and yet failed to relate it with his imagination. For the sate of definition , the area covered by mathematics could be called 'the logical field'. The experienced mathematician becomes aware of various 'facts' in this field, and learns how to relate them to one another. In the same way, alitetary critic requires a knowledge of difierent'facts'in the literary field, and an ability to relate them, to see connections between them. The faculty for relating these facts is not unlike the logical faculty, although it probably contains a larger .element of 'feeling' than the faculty required by a mathematician. But when we c-ome to the field of experience, the'logical faculty'is no longer the right instrument for relating the'facts'. To begin-with, the facts are too complex to be defined like the pieces on a chessboard. A rynic might say, for example: 'All women are alike.' One immedi' ately has to ask tWhat do you mean by \"women\" and what do you r84 185"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"mean by \"alike\"?' Modern mathematics has shown that the premises of u.-athematics are not as solid and as obvious as Euclid and Archi- medes thought. But the'premises'underlying any general statement about experience are infinitely more vague. And just as one and one are fwo, whether we understand the foundations of mathematics or not, so we are able to apply general rules to our everyday experience even though *. have no understanding of the foundations of life. But attempts to generalise about experience are f.ar more treacherous than attempts to generalise about numbers - or about books and writers - and the ordinary logical faculty is of very limited value indeed. The ability to make accurate generalisations about the'field of experience' depends on a faculty that might be called intuition, but which can more correctly be called imagination. An example might make this clearer. Goncharov's young idealist had a tendency to fall in love with every pretty girl. This tendenry finally vanished under the impact of a great deal of experience. But the experience only had the effect of strengthening the imagination so that it could anticipate the same experiences with authority. Hence the man would not merely be able to say: 'I know exactly what it would be like to seduce this pretty but rather empty-headed girl,'but to be able to create the experience in anticipation. This faculty might be called 'imagination', but it might equally well be called a grip on reality. The imagination, then, is merely another tool of the human mind, like reason, its purpose being to work with reason in the task of cor. relating the 'facts' of experience. It can never, of course,be a genuine substitute for experience. No amount of imagination - even aided by reading - could give a young man the same experience as his first love afrair. But life evolves by means of developing 'short cuts'. Man has achieved civilisation by replacing real experiences by symbols, by words, and then by learning to replace whole groups of symbols and , the relations between them by formulae. The'modern neurosis'would f seem to be due to a tendenry to lose contact with the reality under- I lying the formula. Nevertheless, the'formularising' is indispensable. SUMMARY It is necessary at this point to attempt to make some general state- ments about the purpose and methods of literature, and this involves summarising and restating the arguments of earlier chapters. \\?'e judge literature primarily by the pleasure it gives. Although r86 tB plrtyre can ofj., be explained, it can never be ultimately defined. '$7'e can say that we enj6y |ane Austen because of her sense of 'humour, and because her books -aie somehow .ordert,;;U: a.n*a. But this does nor even be_gin ro explain her charm ;\"d ;;;. i;.. Austen never \"1y:' anything important, never expresses any great i*::. Literary critics can therefore only artempt to ixpress their\"own pleasure in reading her, and hope to communicate this pt.rrrr. to their readers. Hengl,.literary crit-icism has nothing in common with, let us *y: 1 sciellirlrr criticism of anothe. ,.i.\"iiri,s theory. ii r.u., has well-defined premises. On the other hand, there is a kind of criticism of literature that is more concerned with ideas.

If it is true, then no one has any right to pass judgment on an unreadable book; the writer has a right t-o repll that artists are not all supposed to be marching in step to the same goal. But here it iinecessary to ittempt a more general an-alysis of litera- tuie and the imagination. It is true that men live from day- to dry,-an$ make few attem\"pts at a gener.al assessment of the value o{ their ' rt \"ggt.. This is 6..rrrr. thE events of everyday life absorb most of the ,tt.iiiott, and because of the 'valve' in the human brain that limits man's consciousness to the present. But man nevel ceases to be awale of the pressures of. pro andiontra in his life. He attempts to establish his hf6 on an even keel, to establish a norm from which he can measure forfune and misfortune. Every minute of the day makes demands on his energy, and therefore on his sense of values (since he has to iudge whetheiil is worth expending the energy). To counteract it. *orrie\"s and anxieties, there ar6 various pleasures and relaxations. Spiritually speaking, man is a kind of bladder floating underwater, respottding to all tt e pressures around him, expanding or contracting acc^ording to the valie judgments that he has to make at every moment. Alt literature has one feature in common - it attempts to step back from the flux of thepresent and to make some broad_er generalisations about'life'. It may step back from the life of individuals, and show a large cross section of iruman existence, Tany Pfople_-suffering.and lov\"i\"g and dying, as in War andPeace or the novels of Kazantzakis' It -ry [o theiam\"e thing in a less ambitious w\"!t 1s in The OldWives' ioi, o, priesrley's pla!- ftme and the Conw_aylIt T_lI-oTly describe the life and problems'of a single individual, as in Wilhelm Meister, Keller's GreeiHenry,|ames's RoderickHudson. Finally, it may take a detached, warmly interested attitude, as in Trollope or fane'f'u,sten, with the und.erlyi\"g assumption that there is no question of judging fif. i\" general, but 6nly of iccepting t!. ambitioni and love affairs of the cen-tral character ai the book's suffi.cient raison d'|fie. But even in this last type of book, a certain value judgment about life is implied. No one would suggest that Trollope is-a romantic pessimist, even though no w_riter is less concerned with-the problems if ho*rtt destiny tf,an Trollope; there is an undeniable attitude of t...ptr\"ce' underlying his,woik, .'t .tt if Trollope has no great-insight i\"to'.itfr.r good ot1 .uIl. There is no writer, no matter how limited, *hor. work\"does not possess some implied value judgment on life and human destinY. It is my contention that these value iudgments are the mainspring t,' -l t' It' ti' L h ry t of the imagination; they are, in fact, so closely connected with it as to be almost synonymous with imagination. Of every work of art, we can ask the question: what kind of world would this be if the events of this book were completely typical of it? .World' here means not merely the physical order of nature, but the relation of man and 'human destiny' to nature. If this question were asked about the ma- iority of stories of supernatural evil, the answer would be that man is a small, helpless creature, stranded in a terrifying universe, his re- lation to this universe being essentially the relation of a child to an adult - one of dependence, and recognition of superiority. This atti- tude is a long way from the Pascalian sense of awe and terror in the face of the universe - in fact, it is the reverse of it. Pascal, like many 'free thinkers' of the nineteeth century, could say with Eliot's Ger- ontion: 'I have no ghosts.' Though he may be a mere insect in a terrifying universe, Pascalian man is adult, fully responsible, strangely dignified by his nescience, a 'thinking reed'. Pascalian man (and one might equally well say Nietzschean man or Dostoevskian man) is closer to the gods, and therefore more aware of the ungodlike element in himself, of his closeness to the beetle. 'Man' in the super- natural tales - whether by M. R. |ames, Tolkien, Bram Stoker - is protected from the world of malignant spirits by bourgeois ordi- nariness. His position in the universe may not be a very great one, but at least it is secrrre. In most science fiction, man is still the unimportant childish creature of the ghost storyr except that his creators now take a slightly more optimistic view of his capacities. In the ghost story, the man who is bold enough to explore the unknown often goes nnad, or meets a nasty end. In the science story, he is likely to get back to earth unscathed. But he is still very much man, not Pascal's thinking reed, poised between god and worm. The powers he possesses are not spiritual powers. But the irnagination is activated by the clash be- tween known and unknown, the way in which the unknown world impinges on the known. The imagination works on this basis of polarities. It now becomes apparent why so much modern literature would appear to harre reached a crisis of imagination. Some writers, such as Gide and Huxley, openly confess that they have little power of imaginative invention. (The thin, muddy trickle of Les Faux Monnayeurs was the work of many years, and even then Gide had to abandon the novel abruptly instead of finishing it.) The heroes of Huxley and Gide are inactive neurotics, confined to their narrow world of self-doubt and reason. '!V'hen Huxley introduces murder into Point Counter Point, it r88 r89"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"seems arbitrary and cazual, not an org,anic part of the book's cenffal problem. This'is because Huxley's polarities are not sufficiently far ipart to activate the imagination; 'passion- and reason' self-division's ciuse', he explains in t[e epigraph to the b-ook, anq the -lulan passions and ihe human reason are both too claustropholically ti-- it.d, too far from the universal, to make an impressive clash. Some kind of moral judgment on the world must, then, be inherent . in all works of literaturt,-th. writer's accepted view of man and the universe - which is to say that, in some sense, every work of fiction that has ever been written is somehow obscurely concerned with the problem of how men should live. The iudgment may-be, oy9rt, as in tandide or Rasselas, both openly concerned with man! dubiols posi- tion in the universe. It may oicur only at the end of a work, as in Epitaph for a Small Winnir, the work of the gteat Brazilian writer fdrq\"i*'de Assis, who feels that his hero is a ismall winner' in the gri\" of life because he has left no children to whom he can pass on ^ ihe miserv of human existence. In this case, as in all classic tragedy, I ;h; poirtiti.t are the hopeless desires of man and the indifference of I tfr. irniverse.

Most-pleasures are brief and easily foigotten; on the other hind, human life seems to be largely a matter of 6brta.ies, always culminating in death, and frequently-in a-great e;ri ; pain. It is easy to_be fully-conscious of 'evil1 any philosopher of *i\"i*it talent can produce a lrundred reasons why life is not worth Iiving.

A man like Dostoevsky, about to be executed, sees it without disguise, and spends the rest of his life trying to explain to human beings that they have no idea what life is. He does so by a curious method; from the gentle melancholy of his early work, his books develop an increasingly gloomy picture of human existence. There are brief flashes of mystical affirmation, but these are only hints. His purpose seems to be to communicate to his readers the inexpressible value of life by deliberately trying to produce a kind of 'soul sickness'in them, and relying on this sickness to evoke a sense of values, in the same way that his near-execution revealed his own values. His own imaginative powers increase as he becomes more deeply aware of the polarities, the visible pole of human misery and 1 futllity and the invisible strength of the powerhouse. F It might be said, then, that the ultimate aim of all imaginative ll literature is to teach men 'what life is'. In La Nausde, Sartre points 1l out that 'nature' has an aggressive way with the human con- sciousness, which is analogous to the way a bellicose man thrusts his ] face close to the face of a person he is threatening. It tends to hypnot- / ise, to jam the 'prehensive powers'. Art is the most primitive human I device for enabling th_e consciousness to retaliate; it attempts to thrust I nature to atm's length. Like science, it works on the principle of hy- pothesis and proof; it suggests 'general theorems' about life (i.e., spirit is good, nature evil;'you can't win'; 'as for living, our servants will do that for us,' etc.) and then tries to create works of art that will'demon- sfrate' the idea. All this means that the Flaubert-|oyce attitude !o literature is un- tenable. Literature need not have a 'message', in the sense that a problem play has, but neither is its purpose simply to hold a mirror up to nature. The passive attitude to literature is ultimately as untenable as total pessimism. No matter how detached and uncomnritted an artist pretends to be, he is involved in a world whose 'direction' is as positive as the current of a river. It is impossible to exercise the im- agination and not to be involved in this current, in man's need for a supra-personal purpose, in the evolutionary drive. TTIE NEED FOR AN EXISTENTIAL CRITICISM ln After Strange Gods, published in 1934, T. S. Eliot suggested that literary criticism should be supplemented by a criticism of a moral or theological nature. No one ever followed up this remark (except r91 190"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"t.'' d I ']. ,,Jl '.: '* fi # ,ti ]i( rl ,* # !r vt 1i{ { {t: t # .!. * ,t , + J Ir : :l I il perhaps Mr Eliot), but its importance as a suggestion is becoming increasingly apparent. The quarter of a century that has elapsed since then has produced many obscure works on which the critics seemed too modest to comment.'WhenFinnegansWahe appeared, no one said boldly that |oyce had totally wasted the twenty years he had devoted to it, in the way that a man wastes the time he spends engraving the Lord's Prayer on a pinhead. \\7hen Beckett's plays were presented in London, and his latest novels published, the bewilderment of the critics was interesting to watch. One noted young theatre critic de voted a long review of. Endgame to a parody of the play; but he took care not to say that it was nonsense. The poetry and novels of the'Beat Generation' have been handled gingerly and sometimes con- temptuously; but no one has bothered to try to define the notion of freedom underlying Kerouac's work and to question its validity. Robbe-Grillet's novels have been called unreadable, but no one has asked whether the idea of the completely 'detached' novel has any meaning, or whether there is not a basic self-contradiction in the whole attempt. This is because we hdve become used to reading books as 'works of literature', and questioning only the impact they make on the sensibilities. This attitude has led us also to accept paintings that are made by throwing paint at the canvas, and music that is written according to a mathematical formula. No one has yet suggested that this is analogous to a physicist accepting symbols and figures tossed at random onto a sheet of paper as a mathematical treatise. Existentialism has been defined as the attempt to apply the rnath- ematical intellect to the raw stuff of living experience. It might also be called an attempt to create a new science - a science of living. Exist- ential criticism is therefore the attempt to judge works of art by the contribution they make to the science of living, to judge them by standards of meaning as well as impact. It can never replace literary criticism, which concerns itself with the general artistic 'satisfai-' toriness'of a work. But neither can literary criticism do without exist- ential criticism, except at the most rudimentary levels. In examining, for example, the work of Hemingway or Eliot or D. H. Lawrence or Aldous Huxley, literary criticism must confine itself to the comment that their later work shows a sad falling off in quality. Since it con- cerns itself only with artistic qualify, it can make no comment on the reasons for the change. It might be suggested that this contrast of literary criticism with existential criticism is only another expression of the old forrn-versus- content controversy, with art-for-art's sake at one extreme and 'en- gaged' realism at the other. This would be to translate the whole L92' matte-r to a superficial level. It is true that, in earlier ages, there was no need for an existential criticism, iust as there was no need for existent- ialism. 'When Christian standards were taken seriously by most people, any work of. art was automatically scrutinised forits'values'. Existential criticism, like existential phiiosophy, is a creation of an age of spiritual flux; the need for it began wtri:n Raskolnikov enun- g?tgg the proposition: All things are larvful. (But Goethe, Byron and Schiller had already experimented with the same idea.) Eliot's 4ftrr Strange Gods is a determined attempt to create an existential criticism. Unfortunately it failed, because Mr Eliot is not a thinker; his absolute refusal to diicuss the basis of his religious con- victions in public is sometimes reminiscent of a Victorian maiden refusing to talk about her underwear. Thus After Strange Gods at- tempts to- discuss its authors - Lawrence, Hopkins, Hardy, |oyce, and others - from the basis of a deliberately mystifying dogmatism. Nevertheless, the intention is clear; and the book is undeniably a work of existential criticism. It fails because it accepts a ready-made set of 'absolute values', or rather, because it refuses to discuss the values as well as the authors to whom they are applied. All this is not to suggest that'existential criticism' can make dog- matic statements about the reasons for the failure of a work of literi- fure. But it can recognise the necessity for understanding the reasons. It can state, for example, that there is a serious contradiction in the work of r. E. Hulme, the early Hulme being a Bergsonian and an evolutionist, the later Hulme a believer in original sin and the com- pletely static quality of human beings. The-same division can be found in the work of Eliot; his early work is animated by his dislike of the morally'static'nature of modern society and theref6re by a desire f9r a 'change'in human nature; the more rLcent plays are bised upon the orthodox Anglican position, and therefore bn -the belief in the unchangeableness of human nature. Since Mr Eliot has come to con- tradict his own early premises, it is not surprising that his later work should appear to be curiously inconclusive. !n writing elsewhere about Hemingway,r have suggested that the fallng off in his post-r93o novels was due to his failuiJto develop his early concern with what I then termed'outsider problems'. fherdwas a certain simplification here, for these problems are not confined to 'outsiders'_(i.e., to oversensitive social misfits). But these problems are certainly the concern of existential criticism - if, in fact, they were a contributory reason to Hemingway's decline as a serious artist. The early Hemingway wrote about the conffast between man's need for a sense of purpose and love, and the indifference (or cruelty) of nature. 19,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"l:;ri:!{i1 :r, url,r l:[.r-1] l'rl,+'ril'i:r ir: :1,:, :) In A Farewell to Armshe adopted a stoic position, and then preferred to write about the 'compensations' of life - big-game hunting, deepsea fishing, sex and alcohol. Like Eliot, Hemingway's later work often reads like self-parody. Mathematicians know that most theorems and propositions ?re sus- ceptible of several proofs, and that some proofs are 'beautiful' and some are clumsy. A mathematician who cared only whether a proof was beautiful or ugly would be the counterpart of the purely literary critic. The existentiil critic is concerned less with the beaury of the proof than with what it is proving. Art is an equation in which there are two terms: the artist and his material. The 'material' is a complex matter of the world he lives in, the tradition he works in, the social forces that enter his daily life. There are three possible attitudes to this equation. The first is the most prevalent in our time: both terms are fixed. The artist is the sensitive observer, and can be no more than honest; the times are the outcome of the current of history, and are beyond the reach of indivi- dual approval or disapproval. Therefore, the artist can only work honestly with the material he has been given, and prove his worth by expressing his 'sense of his own age'. The second attitude is typical of the communist countries. The times can be changed, and the artist can play his small part in the change. His business is to communicate to the people, to play his small part in bringing about the utopia of the future. He must, of course, be an optimist. This attitude is sometimes too quickly condemned in'W'estern coun- tries. Although it may not be desirable as an ultimate philosophy of lyf, it is often preferable to the gloomy subiectivism or sterile experi' mentalism of 'free artists'. Soviet literature and music has produced a great deal of 'popularist' trash; it has also produced many first-rate novels and operas. Social optimism may occasionally be a shallow and inadequate philosophy for the artist, but it is usually preferable to nihilism. The third possible attifude is potentially the most fruitful; it is the artist's belief that both he andhis titnes can be changed. Such an artist would combine the metaphysician with the social reformer. Ka- zantzakis is a modern example of the artist preoccupied by self- change; the proof of his genius lies in his accomplishment of the apparently irrr-possiblq the writing of. a gteat epic poem. 'When most modern writers seem to be agreed that the chaos of time can be ex- pressed only in some experimental, chaotic form like Pound's Cantos, loyce's Ulysses,'sartre's Roads to Freedon, Kazantzakis ignores the tg4 prossibility oJ creating a modernheroic epic, and simply creates one. This could-only have been doneby a mai who *rr^rl.,rstomed. to trying to change himself as well as the world, who believed that the artist is far more than a mere obseryer. , This is the problem of our time: to destroy the idea of man as a 'static observer', !ot! in philosophy and art. Ail imaginative creation ' is involved with the three absolutei: freedom, evolutioln, religion. i NOTES r. A full account of which is given in vincent Brome,s six Studies in Quarrelling.

The article on Huxley, which has been considerably lengthened and rewritten, provides a convenient summary of the methods of existential criticism. I have grouped together these three writers -. Huxley, Diirrenmatt andKazantzakis - because I feel they all begin from the same position of total amoralism ('AlI things are lawful'), and all make a genuine attempt to xeate a system of values. In this sense, they are more 'positive' than any other writers dealt with in this book. Kazantzakis, of course, is dead; it also seems unlikely that Mr Huxley will now make any major alterations in the position he has expounded so brilliantly over the past quarter of a century. Diirrenmatt, however, seems to me a different case; he has started from a position as 'existent- ial' as Nietzsche's, and has already advanced far beyond Camus and Sartre as a creator of positive values. Because he seems to me. to be a most important herald for the future, I have placed him at the end of this book. r96 Appendix One ' Existential Criticism and the Work of Aldous Huxley Some of what r say may seem destructive, and to indicate an anti- Huxley bias._It Tay !e ai w_ell, therefore, to emphasise two important facts about Huxley._9r. is that for the past rweilfy years his voic. has stood fo_r sanity and human dignity in a world tlir't becomes increas- pgl), Iike a nightmare. The other-is that no one can }ave even the briefest contact with Huxley_ without becoming strongly aware of a gentleness and humility whigh indicate plainly it at toif,im discipline and asceticism are not just abstract_worhs. (A poet of the ,93o, or.. described him to me as 'almost saint-like,.) \\ I Bertrand Russell has stated that his aim in philosophy has always been 'to understand the world'. The most inimediate diff.r..r.. f,.- tween existential philoso_phisilg and absfract philosophy can be ex- plained in this wiy: if Russell- achieved his aim, and solved every prollem of philosophy (as he understands it), he would hou. u.t iru.h a vision that would be a sort of glorified version of Newton,s principia. He would have solved the univJrse like a huge crossworcl puzzle.If u\" existential_philosopher _achieved his aim, tlie first probtem tre would understand would be the problem of human suff&ing, of *rr,, ie- lation to God (or to nothingness, if the followers of sartie ,;.;ighr. - For the most central facts in the mind of the existendal thinier are deaj{r and degeneration, the human capacity for self-delusion, tt. problem of huma_n suffering and humanhrppir.ss.

The existential philosopher would begin a dis- cussion on the station of rnan by stating that there are times when he feels a worm, and that this problem is far more important than how long man has inhabited the earth. I Art is naturally concerned with man in his existential aspect, not in I hir scientific aspect. For the scientist, questions about man's stature ' and significance, suffering and power, are not really scientific ques- tions; consequently, he is inclined to regard art as an inferior rec- reation. Unforfunately, the artist has come to accept the scientist's view of himself. The result, I contend, is that art in the twentieth century - literary art in particular - has ceased to take itself seriously ,, as the primary instrument of existential philosophy. It has ceased to regard itself as an instrument for probing questions of human significance. Art is the science of human destiny. Science is the at- tempt to discern the order that underlies the chaos of nature; art is the attempt to discern the order that underlies the chaos of man. At its ,, best, it evokes unifying emotions; it makes the reader see the world , momentarily as a unity. ' But first and foremost, art and existentialism are identified in this: they deal with the question of man's stature: is he a god or a worm? Huxley's first publication was a volume of verse. In the earliest poetry, one detects the influence of Shelley; but aheady, in some of these poems, the Shelleyan poet gives up his attempt to see the world in 'poetic terms', and observes coldly its lack of dignify. This is the first and most important step in Huxley's development. Shelley was the romantic idealist, driven by a sense of the greatness of the human spirit. For him, there were moments when an appalling grandeur seemed to burst through man, when he felt that man could never be defeated by time or misery. Huxley found he could not sustain the burden of this idealism, and he pitched it off in favour of nafuralism. Describing a conversation on top of a bus: ' ;:iiilxl':i,:,1 fi:i?i J;\". : i'' A long mythological poem, Leda, gives him an excuse for dwelling at length on one of his favourite subiects, seduction. Every one of Huxley's maior novels, and many of his stories, contains a seduction or a rape. This is worth observing because of Huxley's ambivalent attifude to sex. Some critics have remarked on Huxley's 'swiftian loathing' of the body; but sex - particularly the idea of the violation of innocence - fascinates him almost as much as it fascinated that other intellectual philosopher of the boudoir, De Sade. In the early Huxley, there is a certain attempt to 'disinfect' this interest in rape and seduction by writing of mythological subfects. Hence Leda aid, the translatioq of Malarmd's L'Aprbs-Midi iun Faune, the story 'cynthia'in which the r-are of Selene by Pan is re-enacted, and many shorter poems on such subiects as'Nero and Sporus,. In tle poems, it seems that Huxley has reluctantly abandoned the poet's faith in the grearness of human feelings, bui there is still a certain greatness in the intellectual honesty that replaces it. And there is a seductive literary charm and grace. - Huxley's first volume of stories follows, Limbo. once again,we are aware of the two worlds. There is the world of human-charm and grace, in a story like'The Bookshop'(which charles Lamb would have enjoyed); bu_t the satirist creeps up in 'The Farcical History of Richard Greenow', the story of an 'intellectual' who changes into a sen- timental female novelist by night. I would be inclinedlo rate'Richard Greenow' as Huxley's finest single literary achievement; except in its final pages, it qomes very close to perfection. There is a certain auto. biographical element, and it is told without self-destructive irony. This gentleness is also there in the first novel, Crotne yellow, which shows the influence of Peacock. The autobiographical element is fo cussed in Denis Stone, the young poet who goes to stay at Crome; but the irony has entered. The irony lies in the contrast between the Shelleyan world of Denis's poetry and his ineffectuality in love and worldly matters. The ineffectual idealist had been a familiar character in nineteenth-century Russian fiction (Turgeniev's Rudin, for example); but Huxley_adds an element of moctery - apparently by way of self-protection. Vhat is most important is that oe^riis r.or.r ro kind of triumph in the novel. It is not about a man floundering and then gaining self-confi dence. __ This is a point worth underlining. Denis is the central figure; llux]9v trk-.r a great deal of trouble to enlist the reader's sympithy for him. The reader obligingly identifies himself with oenii. Ht would like to see him cut a better figure; he would like to see him get the girl and gain a little more self-respect. At the end of the bo6k, Denis is still a shy, oversen-sitive poet, who can never get anything he rya]lY wants. But unlike other poetic failures in literarure --'Wertiher, oblomov, |ulien sorel, Axel - Denis does not seem to enjoy his cre ator's symp-athy; he gets a raw deal from every angle. Huxley,s readers might have been forgiven for being p:uzzlid. Tliey were used to oversensitive heroes; most of them had read their prouit, their Sira- r98 r99"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"ister Street, their Portrait of the Artist as ayoungMan. But proust, Mackenzie and |oyce had taken care to indicate that the weakness of their characters was also a kind of strength (iust as Shaw, in Candida, !a$ expressed his feeling of the poet's ultimate triumph - after his failure in love - with the words 'But they do not knof the secret in tlre poet's heart'). Huxley seems to be saying: If you are sensitive, there is no alternative to being unheroic and ineffeitual. Denis is his first incarnation of the Chinless Intelligent hero. There is, ot' course, an element in Crome Yellow that can be best understood in relation to the mood of postwar Bloomsbury. Lytton Strachey had created a mood for a whole generation when he wrote in a frankly personal and prejudiced manner about some eminent Vic- torians.(r9r8). But this cannot be held wholly responsible for Huxley's switch from idealism to satire. Besides, Huxley Lrought to it a wholly new feeling of metaphysics; his satire is not historical, like Strachey's, but philosophical. There are some interesting developments in his next novel, Antic Hay Qg4). once again, the cenfral character is shy and oversensitive, and consequently frustrated in his emotional life.-But Huxley is not y_et ready to make his meanings unequivocal, so Gumbril also ieceives the satirical treatment. From the opening chapter, you would suppose that the book is g_oing to be a piecebf oblectlve and iighthearted s^aiire, \\y ^ more intelligent Nodl coward. Gumbril b\"yr a blond beard from a theatrical costumier, wears a coat with padded shoulders, and fortified by these aids to self-respect, goes into ihe world in search of heroic adventure. And heroism will include Getting the Girl - sexual conquest. The blond beard is successful. His first appearance in it leads him into someone's bed. Later, the beard helps him to get the girl he is acfually in love with. And when he wishis to seduce her, hJremoves the beard, and the seduction still goes forward without a hitch. un- fortunately, fate is still lying in wait with a sandbag. The girl deserts him because she is-afraid of happiness, and he is lefi aloneigain, still oversensitive and frustrated. Moral: even if the sensitive man over- comes his ineffectuality, Fate will sneak up on him and get him from another angle. He can't win. But this blond beard symbol has not yet yielded up irs full significance. It is not simply a symbol of self-confidence. there is a section in a long poem, 'Soles occidere et Redire Possunt', that eluci- dates it: : ' OnII omissively -to sin, _- \\feakly kind and cowdrdly chaste. But when the war is over, : I_will go to the East-and_plant i lr,fiilJi*.0;l;:li*:i\"\"fl*.*1#J\"\",, r' And flagellate them with whips l, I shall be enormously myself,- I Incarnate Chin., .t The first stanza palnts the fypical Huxley hero, the chinless, intelli- . gent man. rn the second,. he dons the blond beard, he becomes I Incarnate Chin. Yet he does so by-an act of self-delusio\", ry.o\"- vincing himself that he is God's-gift to Africa. one is immediately reminded of sartre's story, 'L'Enfance d'un chef', in which another chinless, intelligent T3n conquers his oversensitivity by becoming a fanatical anti-semite. He refuses to bear the burden oi t ii sensitivit! - the faculty th-at raises him above other men - and deliberately stupefies lrimself. This is bad faith, another fundarnental concept of existentialism. Huxley's implication is that Gumbril's histrionits in the blond beard are also an ait of bad faith. '!7'e might recall an axiom of another existential philosopher, Ni- e_tzsche: 'The great man is the play-actor of his o*o ideals,'(Be yond Good and Evil). T!r. existentialisf problem is the problem of ou.r- sen-sitivity. It is self-analysis, knowledge, the 'tree of good and evil,. It makes the ancient hero impossible - thb modern hero is Hamlet, Faust, Dostoe-vsky's Beetle Man who is contemptuous and envious of the man of action who 'lowers his head and charges like a bull'. (Huxley, like Dostoevsky, takes pleasure in comparinghen to insects; Gumbiil states: 'I glory_in the nime of earwig'f Antic Hay might be subtitled: How Not to Be a Hamlet. The solution that is 6riefly examined and rejected in this novel is: wear a blond beard. ' But is it absolutely necessary that Not Being a Hamlet involves self- deception? Nietz:sche obviously thought so. Play-acting is self-de- gepli9l(presumably). l\" that case, living up to an ideal is also bad faith? This is implied in Huxley's_rejection- of Shelley in his early poetry.- He found the Shelley ideal too difficult to live up to, anh ' rejected it; to accept would have been bad faith. But what, in that case, would_be good faith? It would be simple, instinctive life, unreflective vitality. And this kind of instinc[ive living is impossible for the Hamlet, whose consciousness of the pleasure of living is diluted by reason. There is no turning back. There is, perhaps, a possible solution, but it is not one that Huxley ever considers seriously. There are two ways of cornpensating for di[i- 'Misery,'he said, ''to have no chin, Nothing but brains and sex and taste, 20r"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"tion. If your cofiee is too weak, you can either add less water or use a strongei cofiee. Huxley never ceases to ieer at the people who accept the first of these alternatives, the men incapable of reason; or - worse still - the men who abnegate reason and choose emotion. If one has reason, one must use it, even if the self-analysis dilutes one's con- sciousness until it is almost tasteless, until the appetite for life is en- feebled. But at this point one becomes aware of Huxley's most dangerous weakness: a certain frivolity, an ambiguity about his feel- ings. For he might choose the second alternative to intensify the will, to rise to heroic efforts of feeling and analysis, even if its im- plications seem tragic - as in Nietzsche or Kazantzakis. But Huxley is too much the epicurean, too addicted to posing, to accept this answer to the problem he postulates. He is the satirist, not the saint. He will jeer at stupidity, but he has no inclination to be amartyr for'truth'. Not yet, anyway. His ambiguous attitude to his own work becomes apparent in his next novel, Those Barren Leqves. This shows a sad falling off in qual- ify from Antic Hay, Huxley is now content to be the pet of Blooms- bury, the witty essayist, the cultured scourge of intellectual shams and lukewarm eroticism. The book is a leisurely, seif-satisfied piece of work, a boring feat of social comedy and intellectual agility that is probably the most effete thing Huxley ever wrote.In Antic Hay he had satirised the overcultured Mr Mercaptan with his devotion to Cr6billon fls and his witty little essays published in a highbrow weekly; Those Barren Leaves might have been written by Mercaptan. Point Counter Point (r928) is a return to seriousness, but it shows some of Huxley's worst mannerisms making inroads in his work. Manifestly influenced by Gide's Les Faux Monnayeurs (as the opening of. Antic Hoy was influenced by Ulysses), it tackles the Hamlet prob- lem, the problem of bad faith, as honestly as Hu-rley is capable of attacking it. He is at last in the open, with no pretense at lighthearted satire. There are three major characters in it: Philip Quarles (Huxley's mouthpiece), Rampion - a portrait of D. H. Lawrence, and Spandrell, apparently inspired by Stavrogin in Dostoevsky'sDevils, a man with- out motive or conviction, clever, rich and bored. Spandrell illustrates Huxley's usual ambiguity of attitude, for in an essay on Baudelaire, published at the same time as Point Counter Point, there is a violent condemnation of Dostoevsky, with special reference to Stavrogin. Philip's marriage is menaced by his own dehydrated intellectuality, and by Everard'W'ebley, the leader of the League of British Fascists. (this showed remarkable anticipation on Huxley's part; in rgz8, Hitler was still an unknown agitator, and Mosley a young socialist,) \\Tbbley is in love with Philip's wife. on this level; the novel contaihs the usual Huxley antinomies: Chinless Intellect versus Big-chinned Bad Faith. But Rampion-Lawrence appears as a type of man preferable to either. Philip reflects: p-eing with Rampion rather depresses me; for he makes me see what a great gulf separates the knowledge of the obvious from the actual living of it.-And oh! the dificulties of crossing the gulf.

It's the substitution of simple intellectual schemata for the com- plexities of reality ... it's much easiei to be an intellectual child or a lunatic than a harmonious adult man. .- This, then, is the aim of Huxley's work: to create a picture of the 'harmonious, adult man', Gumbril's Complete Man. ilut it would s-eem as if Rampion was included rather as i compliment to Lawrenbe than as a tenable solution of the problem of the eomplete Man. Ram- pion_is rather a bore (as Lawrence himself found him on reading the lougD. There may even be an element of dishonesty in the porlrait, for Huxley has created a far more scathing, and iathe, *6r. ,on- vincing, picture of Lawrence, as Kingham in Two or Three Graces. At 9ne poin!-i\" _t_h. novel, Rampion attacks shelley for bad faith.- for leing a 'bloodless white worm' of idealism (Hulley has a talent for disgusting images), who lost contact with Mother Earth. But Back-to. Nafure _Rampion does not seem Mother Earth's answer to Shelley's failure. H-uxley obviously wanted to portray the nature-god type of artist - the type that Thomas Mann thought Goethe ind Tolstoy repres-ented - but his artistry failed to rise to the occasion. Rampion resembles Tolstoy in expressing a dislike of Beethoven - in this iase, the third movement of opus r3z - but the effect he produces is a kind _of under-gradrrate cantankerousness. Rampion is tooinreflective to be heroic - like his original. In his- soliloquy on the 'harmonious adult man', Philip has touched on another existentialist problem: that of authentic and inauthentic existence. Inauthentic existence is almost another name for bad faith, but with this difference: bad faith is a form of. deliberare self-de ception, inauthentic existence may be simply a mistake. A man has not committed bad faith until 'knowing thd good, he chooses the bad,. '!V'hen a man discovers that he is half living instead of living, he has achieved a degree of self-knowledge that demands that he dismantle his life and personality and start building again from the bottom.

Miles Fanning comments: 'A world without go-odness - it'd be Paridise.' Then for five long paragraphs. Hux1ey analyses_ the thoughts and feelings of his characters at length - for about a thou- sand\"words. Fina1lyl he gets back to the point he left from: 'He had been, for some obicure ieasott, suddenly depressed by his own last words. \"A world without goodness - it'dbe Paradise.\"' HeIe, Huxley has no alternative but to repeat the sentence, since he has held up the action by two pages of rumination, and can hardly expect the reader to remember what Fanning's last words were. After the Fireworhs pi'ovides several more examples of Huxley's weakness as a creative writer. It is a very long story - more than a hundred pages - whose essentials could be compressed into a thousand wolds. A fit o,rt novelist, frf.ty years of age, receives a fan letter from a pretty girl of twenty-one. He meets her, takes her out for meals, and rh. \"\"[iby becoming tris mistress. Then-he gets tired of her, she is upset by his coldness,-and ends by leaving him for a less intelligent but more faithful young man. The story b'ears the signs of being a wish-fulfilment fantasy, rather like Rolfe'iDesire andPwsuit of theWhole.It seems to have no more 'point' than Hemingway's similar exercise in sexual self-aggrand- iiement in Across the Riyer qnd Into the Trees. It is interesting to note the way that Huxley handles the scenes in which Fanning and Pamela becorne acquainted. Fanning is supposed to be a fountain of witty and sophisticlted conversation. His remark about a world with- out goodnesJ is a fair sample of his 'sophistication'. The-'witty con- versition' consists in endless intellectual theorising, which progresses by Huxley's usual essayistic,method - association of ideas. To speak of [iuxley's -'wit' is rathei misleading; ther_e is very_little in his writing that rlminds one of Oscar \\flilde or Sydney Smith. He takes no trouble to conceal the processes of thought by which he arrives at his bon mots - on the contrary, he takes pleasure in showing the leader every single step of his thought progres_sioqs, complete with lefer- .r.o to plinteri and musicians onb is unlikely to have heard of, and quotatioris in foreign languages. Once one_ gets used to his habit of foought, one can retognise thebon mot in the distance; he signals it as a bad'boxer signals i punch. It is not unlike Chesterton's habit of paradox that makes hi] later writin-g so monotonously predictllle. ih. .onr.quence of all this is that the reader simp-ly canr_rot believe that Fanniirg is sexually attractive to Pamela, and the final seduction seems dowruight incredible. The reader seems to he-ar Fanning's highly cultured monologues in a fluting, sexless voice that trips skil- f\"lly through quotations in Italian and Latin. Nothing 9ou1{ be more conducive Io dissipating a young girl's infafuation. At times, the Huxleyan'wit' beJomeJas pondeious and ltylised as the 'conceits' of Elizabethan poetry, involving long metaphors and far-fetched com- parisons. Phiiip Quarles is right; in some indefinabl. w3.y-, Huxley is luite out of touch with reality and this story contains all his faults in capsule form. The problem is that Huxley would regard-it as bad faith tq gtop intelleciualising, and yet while he intellectualises, he delays indefinitely thE act of itarting to create. !h1s paradox is revealed' clearly in the volume of essays that followed Point Cou.nter Point - DoWh.atYouWill - where Huxley seems determined to escape the limitations of his intellectualism. In an essay on Swift, he attacks Swift for his maniacal loathing of the body and its functions. In Frqncis and Gregory, he compaies St Francis unfavourably with Ras putin, emphasising Rasputin'i Whitma,nesque love of tJre b1dy. In the irrry on Baudelaiie already mentioned, he praises Robert Burns and attalks Dostoevsky as a kind of emotional masturbator who created characters withoui bodies. He criticises Pascal for allowing his re' ligion to be influenced by his sickness. \"fnu strange thing is ihat Huxley's novels contain all the faults he condemned I the distaste for the body and its functions, the fear of positive belief, the dilettantism, the bodiless characters which he con- 'd.*rr in Dostoevsky. He also has a sick man's hatred of illess @e was bedridden for a part of his childhood, and was almost blind for , many years). At the end of After the Fiteworks, Pamela's infatuation for Fanning finally dissolves when he is ill, and she has to nurse him. The notion-that two people might be drawn closer together by such an experience never t..irt [o enter Huxley! mind.-His own appetite for life is so easily undermined by the sight of illness that he cannot imagine that healthy people might find illness less_disgusting. This is the\"very essence of FIuxGy's fiilure as an artist. He is so firmly en' trenched in his own weaknesses that he can never escaPe them, even in imagination, or create a charucter who is free from them. In this respect, he resembles Graham Greene. ' In r93r there was an amusing and instructive exchange lgjween Huxley and Ernest Hemingyrt, which shows two quitq {99,*tlt kinds of conceit at loggerh.udr. in an essay called'Foreheads Villain' ous Low', Huxley criticised Hemingway: In A Farewell to Arms, Mr Ernest Hemingway ventures once, to o*\" an Old Master.

Huxley went on to say that once upon a time the stupid tried to be thought educated; now the snobbery was inverted, and the educated wanted to appear stupid. It seems unbelievable that Huxley, who was an enthusiastic admirer of Lawrence, should be unable to sense the merit of A Farewell. to Arms, with its technique of detachment and understatement. Or at least, if he did sense it, that he should be unable to see that references to Mantegna could only weaken a book like A Earewell to Arms.a Hemingway replied to these criticisms in Death in th.e Afternoon, which shares with Green Hills of Africa the distinction of being his worst book, full of fake simplicity, fake toughness and fake wisdom. Hemingway came back with violent counter-charges that were as unfair to Huxley as Huxley had been to him, declaring that a writer who spices his books with culture must be a faker who wants to show off. He talked gravely about the writer's responsibility to create people, not characters, and offered other generalisations to prove that, for all his casualness, he was a serious artist. But just as Huxley had missed the real quality of the best Hemingway - which uses de- tachment to convey intense love of the physical world in spite of its brutality - so Flerningway seems to have had no awareness of the quality that makes 'Richard Greenow' and Antic Hay minor master- pieces. This failure of understanding is a revelation of the weaknesses of both. The very qualities that caused Huxley's deterioration - intel- lectuality and affectation - are the qualities Hemingway despises; the qualities that caused Hemingway's deterioration - conceit, intellec- tual laziness - are the qualities that Huxley despises. A combination of Huxley and Hemingway would probably be a very great writer. As it is, the two writers are mirrors each faithfully reflecting the fatal weakness of the other. Huxley's worst qualities - the self-satisfied intellectuality of. Those Barren Leayes and the desire to be regarded as Bloomsbury's brilliant enfant terrible - disappear after ry3o; but the long-winded style remains, the unrealistic treatment of sex remains, and, worst of all, the 'weakness premise' remains. He cannot believe that human strength can exist, or conceive it imaginatively. His boring portrait of old ]ohn Bidlake, the painter (based on Augustus )ohn) in Point Counter Point, proves this; this character is always idenrified by , 208 Huxleyan leifrnotif, a 'booming Rabelaisian laugb'. (The_se leitmotifs are a iign of Huxley's uninventiveness, and recur in all his novels, another aspect of his tendency to repeat himself.) The usual ambiguity and self-division are apparent in Brmte New Vorld (rql r). Intellectually, the book is an exposure of the commu- nist-humanist fallacy that man is perfectible and needs only better social conditions; Huxley argues for imagination and poetry. Bu! the central character is once again the Chinless Intelligent man. The book deserves high praise: it is brilliant, amusing, penetrating, intelligent. But it is also negative. The existential problem - How not to be a Hamlet - is still unanswered. The book is an argument against mere reason and common sense. Enlightened sexual relationships are ex- posed as boring and meaningless. A high standard-of education makes for mediocrity. The book argues for'inner direction', for the personal against the impersonal, for the poetry of Shakespeare against the economics of Manr. Yet though Huxley is so expert at exposing the meaningless and boring, the unvital and futile, he has no creative power to erpress the vital, the heroic. In making his Chinless Intelli- gent man the hero of the book and the rebel against the ethics of the brave new world, Huxley seems to be setting the seal of his approval on his weaknesses, as if saying 'Keep your neuroses and obsessions; without them, you would be a mediocrity like the others'; If this is so, then Huxley has abandoned all attempt to solve the problem of the 'harmonious' man. I have commented that the earlier Huxley seemed sneakingly ashamed of himself for not being more serious, for not being willing tb be a'martyr for truth'. After his orgy of satire inBraye New World, Huxley seemed to experience a revulsion for the old intellectual dilet- tante who had written Those Barren Leayes. ?otnt Counter Point seems to have been modelled on Gide, and Brape Naw World on Zamiafin; his next major novel seems to be inspired by Proust. (Characteristically, there is a sneering reference to Proust in its early pages.) Eycless in Gaza is Huxley's major attempt to find an ideal to live by, to abandon the old universal scepticism and commit himself to a faith. However, the Proustian influence seems to have been only a starting point, which led him to play tricks with the time sequence o_f the chapters. It also serves to emphasise the main theme of the Look - the need for the 'timeless' realiry. The main character is once again the over-sensitive modest man. Like Philip Quarles, he keeps a iournal. But unlike any previous Huxley hero, he is interested in religion, in m-ysticism, Tr4 in the problem of man's responsibility to other men. The plot of the book is largely the mixture as before: weakriess, ,l ,,$. t1 */ 'I hr.

The reader becomes aware that Huxley's idea of sex is strangely adolescent, as idealistic- ally unreal as - though less detailed than a schoolboy's accounts_of his sexual conquests. Obispo is a cruel, coarse lovemaker, with no finesse, a man without emotions, who treats sex purely as a physical exercise; but in this exercise he has a devilish skill that can play on a girl's body as if it were a harp, rousing it to an insanity of lust .. . And so on. Huxley's sex scenes have the air of having been written by a fourteen- year-old virgin with a vivid imagination. - The main conflict of the book, between the saintly Propter and the selfish millionaire (who is, however, by no means wholly bad - only stupid), provides Af ter Many a Summer with its main interest, and is superbly done. But Propter has long chunks of discourse that might have been listed straight out of any of Huxley's later books. More- over, there is something very subtly unsatisfying about all his talk about 'absolute reality', no matter how much one sympathises basi- cally. The same thing is wrong with all the religious ideas of the later Huxley, as expressed in Thc Perennial Philosoph.y and Grey Em,i- ncnce. For all his attempts to escape his lirnitations, Huxley is still a kind of Manichee, a man who will never feel a \\Thitrnanesque accept- ance of the world. He cannot control his dislike. As Propter inveighs against the selfishness of industrialists and the stupidity of dictators, one continues to feel that this is still the world-hater of Point Counter Point, the man whose influence in the twenties had turned Lawrence into a clumsy and malicious satirist. There is something wrong, He is still not Holy Huxley. His knowledge of 'the way' of Brahman is curiously dehydrated, bodiless. The knowledge that Hemingway pos- sesses so abundantly - of the goodness of physical reality - is missing. And yet After Many a Summer remains a splendid book. This is partly due to the presence of |eremy Pordage, who represents the best side of Huxley, the love of literature and of the past, the Fluxley who is a not-too-distant relation of Charles Lamb. One suspects that the Huxley who began to develop with Those Barren Leaves was an ap- palling mistake, a series of attempts to graft onto this original Hux1ey various misconceived alter egos: the ruthless satirist Huxley, Huxley the castigator of morals, Huxley the saint, Huxley the pro- fessor. This becomes more apparent in the book that followed After Nfany a Sulnnxcr - Grey Eminence, a study of Father |oseph of Paris, the 2Lt vanity, self-delusion.

And yet, creatively speaking, he was as far as ever from his ab- solute. ]ust as Braye Nrw Wotldhad been a reversion to the manner of Antic Hay, and Eyeless in Gaza to that of Point Countet Point, so his new novel Aftir Mony a Summef was a reversion to Ctome Yel.low. The novel is set in California. An English 'belle-lettrist' (i.e., a liter- ary dilettante), feremy Pordage, has gone to California to .edit -some prp.*r for an'unpleaiant millionaire named Stoyte, who lives in an imitrtioo castle *itt his pretty young mistress Virginia and a suave Casanova of a doctor, Obiipo.

The section called '\\[hat can be done?' has no sol- ution to ofler, except (perhaps the only one possible) that we can be 'educated to freedom'. Thc Devils of Loudun, which followed Ape and Essence, is a pen- dant to Grey Eminencc, and is very nearly as good. The 'demonic possession' of the Loudun nuns had been briefly mentioned in the earlier book, together with a short account of the trial and execution of the priest Urbain Grandier. Huxley takes his usual delight in de- scribing the sexual escapades of Grandier, the 'goat in a biretta', and a feeling of frusfrated sexuality hangs over the book like a fog. In spite of this, the book has some of Huxley's best pages. This was followed in ry51, by The Doors of Perception, Huxley's account of his mescalin experiments, which contains the interesting admission: I am and .. . always have been a poor visualiser. 'Words, even the pregnant words of poets, do not evoke pictures in my mind ... \\7hen I recall something, the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object. By an effort of will, I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon, of how the Lungarno used to look before the bridges were destroyed, of the Bayswater Road when the only buses were green and tiny and drawn by aged horses ... But such images have little substance, and absolutely no autonomous life of their own. They stand to real, pqrceived obfects in the same relation as ' Homer's ghost stood to ... men of flesh and blood ... To those in whom the faculty of visualisation is strong my inner world must seem curi- ously drab, limited and uninteresting. All this can easily be guessed from Huxley's novels. It is what rnakes them basically unsatisfying. Fluxley's world lacks life, lacks afmos- phere, lacks vitality, lacks the smell and colour and feel of the real world. Huxley argues that mescalin should become generally available to the public, and that it would probably replace alcohol and tobacco as a stimulant. It would also help to combat the problem of the 'civilisation neurosis' that causes so many of our social problems - particularly crime and suicide. This seems a reasonable argument, and yet it has raised strong resistance, particularly from the churches and from some of Mr Huxley's'fellow seekers'(like Arthur Koestler).The obiec- tion is that'divine insight' induced by drugs is a very different thing from divine insight produced by long ascetic discipline. There is an obvious element of truth in this. The 'visiorrary experience' in itself is nothing, what matters is the ability of the perceiving mind to grasp its spiritual adviser of Richelieu. Here lqxJey-shows himself to be a born .tistorian; some of his evocations of the Thirty Years 'W'ar are more moving and exciting than anything in thelove]s. pn the whole, it is probabie that G:reynminenci is Huxley's best book. It allows op-por- iunity for the expression of all his best-tlualities - the sharp intellect, the love of the pist - and for none of the bad ones: malice, the sexual obsession, cleverness for its own sake. The superiority t} the essayist Huxley becomes more obvious when orr..o*prres his-later novels with the works of non-fiction. Each novel is fo[o#ed by a non-fiction book: Time Must Have -o S9!

(Orie wonders why it is that Huxle-y is drawn back so Pel sistently tb,memories of childhood and adolescent humiliation.)-It actually borrows one episode from Antic Hay (the play scene,with the prostitute) and involvds the new hero in it.

The later books show these young men developing into -socially re- . rporrift. individuals with a clrtain grasp of religious 'fundamentals'. ^ Thi, is as far as 'literary criticism' can go - to consider the artist's aims, and how far he his achieved them. It is by-considering the general'unsatisfactoriness' of all l{uxle.yls work that literary criticism ittempts to expand into existential criticism. One reason for this sense of 'sofrething iacking' I have already suggested: Huxley's attitude to the physicaf world,-which is nevei far from that of Sartre n I\"a Naui6,i.It takes very little to disgust him. Onehas only to compar-e ihe deathbed scene s in Point Cointcr Point or Eycl.ess in Gaza with . Tolstoy's death of Count Bezukhov in'War and Peace or Trollope's death tf tn. bishop in Barchcster Towers, to realise that Huxley is always too near the borderline of 'nausea'.

Unfortulate-11', although he is serious, Huxley never takes himself that seviou-sly. He can never escape a tendency io do intellecfual cartwheels and hand- stands; he can never escape from his own frivolity. 'When I was writing- the first version of this article, I was also engaged on a book thaiattempted to define the'weakncss premise'in a fi{at deal of rnodern literature, and the general 'unheroic hypoth- esii' that is exemplified in Huxley's writing. I had some correspon- dence with him on the subiect of the hero, which he has given me permission to quote. .The study of literature and art is surely e v€ry indirect and inadequate way of studying the total human situation, if only because Pany.of the -oit rigpificaniaspects of that situation simply don't lend themselves to treet-eit in literature. For example, how can anyone write a. play, poem or novel about the pressure of population on resources? This paragraph shows Huxley's typical later_preoccupation with social pfoblems. The obverse side of the coin is his ulwllingness to admit that the writer's task may be to speak about the human will rather than about the problems of civilisation.'When I suggested that his heroes never learn to act, he replied by retorting that some of the literafure of the 'Angry Young Men' showed the same deficienry, adding that 'Look Bich in Anger is surely far more negative than anythlng I have been guilty of; for it is merely the story of a neurotic w6o *ullows in his neurosis and refuses to come to terms with the kind of universe we have been born into.'

Shaw Said: ''When the shooting starts, I get under the bed'; one wishes '' ' iizrntzakis'heroes had half ai much sense. : This brings up another point about Kazantzakis.

One suspects thatKazantzakis saw himself as the nephew, and was somehow trying to propitiate his father's ghost. I Thii same self-division is apparent in the other novels. Zorba the ', Greek is the most amusing of thes\". It is told i\" tl-r9 first persot bI Kazantzakis, who meets Zorba in a waterfront caf6 in Piraeus, and i agrees to take him to Crete.

He is the unhapPy i\"t+.ctual, i, :,n ho rir., makes tle effort to heal his own self-division and becomes 1: ' reconciled to the 'original sin' that makes him at once greater and less : happy than zoyba.

But Shaw had no secret longing to be a i ploughman, and the-'pur[ose' is stated explicitly-in the third,act of ' i Uor rnd Supe rmon. kurintzakis never reiched-this sta-ge, although , he declared (i, fht Saviours of God) that 'God' is saved by the men , who dare to be creative, and wrote in a letter: 'If we are to set a pulpose, it is this: to transubstantiate matter and turn it into sP11it.' ittir ir ..rtainly Shaw's conception. But there was also a streak of i, Nietzsche in Kazantzakis. |usl as Nietzsche could create his con- h ception of the Superman, and then invalidate it by 'Eternal recur- i reirce', so Kazantzikis expresses his gospel of struggle and creation in . The Saviours of God, but^ends: 'Blessid ire all those who free you and . become united with you, Lord,. and who say: \"Y9Y and I are one.\" And thriCe blessed be'those who bear on their shoulders and do not bend i d.oes not exiit.'There can hardly be a-betier example in all philosophy i of what the logical positivists- call 'nonsense', a .statement that in- validates itself by destroying its own meaning.

Its original-title wis My Father, and it deals with th-. ,rrro.cessful rebellion of the Cretans against the Turks in ,SS9. Kazantzakis was old elough to remember this clearly, as well as ilie iebellion of 1896, when the Turks were finally expelled. Crete had b.ett oppressed by the Turks for a hundred years, and there had been many Lioody rrpiitingt and endless violence.

The mon- ,ri.ry and everyone in it were blown to atoms. In these risings, both sides\"were completely merciless; wornen would be raped and mur- dered, children bayoneted, the men often tortured to death.

At the time of writing (1961), Kazantzakis' last novel, The Poor Man of God, dealing with St Francis of Assisi, has still not been published in English.

One of the aPparentlY insignificant and yet central figures in the play is the Angel who delivers the girl to earth. He is a comic figure, deceived by the king, a conventional absent- minded'professor. And yet, like Rilke's Angel, he is pure affirmation. He is delighted with the earth and can see nothing wrong with it. He tells the girl that all apparent disorders are only temporary errors in the'divine order. He spends most of the play flying round the earth to examine its wonders, reappearing at intervals full of enthusiasm, wholly unable to understand the trivialities that human beings con- sider as sufferings. He is the symbol of the Nietzschean order of re- ality and affirmation, beyond good and evil, beyond the indignify of sufiering. 'Heaven never lies, my child. Only sometimes it finds it difficult to make itself understood bv humans.' And when Kurrubi -comments that the poorest beggar on earth hust be unhappy, the Ange1 replies: 'All that is created is good, and all that is good, is happy. In all my travels throughout creation, I have never en- countered as much as one grain of unhappiness.' This is a Shavian conception: when men cease to be so trivial and self-preoccupied, they will also cease to suffer. \" breadth and good humour. From the author of 'The Tunnel', it is an ' amazing work. Here is a man who would only chuckle satirically at \" Sartre's comment that the reality of life is horror.

And yet Diirrenmatt proves again aJmostbecalleclUhesterton1an.AndyetIJuITenmattproveSagarn and again that he possesses to the full the'terrible insight' of the most , pessimistic of existentialists. \" This is proved in what I consider to be Diirrenmatt's two most i clear and powerful works so far: the novels The Pledge and Traps. (The other novels, The ludge and His Hangman and Suspicion, arc simply thtillers with philosophical overtones.) , Traps is a mere eighty pages long. It tells how a little commercial ' traveller, Alfred Traps, has a breakdown on the road and has to stay in ',' a small village overnight. A retired judge offers to put him up. Traps i' is given an excellent supper, and introduced to three more very old men, a retired hangman and two retired barristers. The four old men are in the habit of playing a game over their epicurean suppers; they ' hru. mock trials ai wfti.h ttre iudge presides, and the two counsels , defend and prosecute any guest who can be persuaded to play. The : hangman is there purely for effect. Traps agaees to play. But he per- sists in saying that he has no crime to confess to. (This sounds like Kafka, but the resemblance is only superficial.) So, over a huge meal, 23r into her coffee. He proposes that he and Olympia should marry to 'expiate' their crime, and she finally agrees. The rest of the plot is_too coriplicated to detail here.It ends, likeHarnlet,with everyone {.1d oP stag6; but it is Mississippi, with his simple-minded notion of Mosaic law, who is most completely be1ayed. The play is like Pirandello's in technique. Characters-often address the audience; the_end takes place before the beginning and is repeated again at the end; stage rlstruc- tions are chalty ,t d' ittfot*al;-some cliaracters discuss-the -author of the play with tLe audience. One of them even explains that the author wrnt\"d to treat the problem of 'whether the human mind is able to altet aworld which merely cxists'; but, as with PirandellO, the charac- ters got out of hand once they were created. The-e_lay seem-s t9 .o3- trast\"the grotesque complexity of the world with Mississipp_i's-single; minded dJsire foi order ind morality; it seems to be saying,'Ord,er and morality are the total meaning thai rrlqy emerge fro-m the totaliry of experience; it cannot be imposed'. It may-be n-oted in passing that there is some satire on communism in the play, as elsewhere in Diirrenmatt, but the satire is good-natured, in the manner of. Animql Earm. I shall deal with the other two plays very briefly. (Dtirrenmatt h,as written seven so far, but I have noi read the other three.) Romulus the Greqt is a not-very-funny comedy in the manner of Ofienbach (La Belle H6lbne, Orfheus, btc), poking fun at antiquity. Romulus 5 the last of the Roman ertpetotJ, very broke and rather bored by it aII. As the barbarians (Germins) advance on Rome he refuses to do any- thing about it all. He admits that he had done nothing to save RgPg, but ienies that he has betrayed Rome. 'Rome has betrayed itself. It knew the truth but chose foice; knew humanify but chose tyranny.' But for all his 'incompetence'he is the one who survives best; he gets on exceLlently with th. .r.*y general, Odo, and is given,a house and a pension. Romutrus brings to mind Shaw's Kittg Charles, but the play sufiers by comparison with Shaw. t . An Ahgel io*rt to Babylon. is in 9very way delightful, a fantastic rourf *ltfi serious overtones.

And Traps would stagger drunkenly of to bed with a deep iense of grievance; there is no justice in the world. Such an ending would surely have made Diirrenmatt's point as clearly as the m_ore 'dramatic'but more contrived suicide. One feels that Diirrenmatt has allowed a stagy sense of drama to dominate the ending instead of the sense of reality that appears so brilliantly throughout the story. This cannot be said of The Pl.edge, the work that succeeds in sug- gesting the deepest implications of Diirrenmatt's 'philosophy'. Matthiii is a police ofi\"cer in Switzerland who has always been known for his mechanical precision. But he is not well liked. He is ofiered promotion to the police force in |ordan. |ust before he goes, a small giil is murdered by a sex maniac. He promises the parents of the child - Grittli Moser - that he will avenge her death. An old peddler is suspected. The police grill him until he confesses. He commits suicide in his cell. Buf Matthdi is convinced that the peddler was not the killer, and he sets out to investigate the murder himself. His fellow policemen naturally dislike this interference; the case is closed, and Matthii is due in ]ordan. Matthii decides not to go to |ordan; he will stay and continue to investigate the murder as a private citizen. He finds a few clues that indicate that the murderer is a big man who drives an American car with the sign of the Swiss cantons on the number plate - an ibex. By now, the case has become Matthii's obsession. He buys a garage near a main road, and persuades a prosti- tute to becorne his housekeeper. The prostitute has a small daughter who looks very much like Grittli Moser - and like two other girls who have been murdered in recent years. The prostitute, of course, is un- awate that her daughter is being used as bait for a sex maniac with a tazot. Finally, Matthii phones the police in excitement; the child Anne- marie is seeing a stranger who gives her chocolate fruffles. Matthii is convinced that this is the killer. AU the police have to do is lie in Wait near the child. They do this, as the child waits unsuspectingly in the woods. But the murderer never comes. The prostitute goes on working for Matthii, becoming more and more sluttish. Her daugh- ter Annemarie grows up, she too becomes a slut. And Matthii, going on waiting for the killer beside his gasoline pump, becomes a hopeless drunk. The police officer who is telling the story to Diirrenmatt finally sfumbled on its conclusion. An old lady, dying in a hospital, confessed that she knew the killer. He was aboy, many years her junior, whom 233 with many difierent wines, they proceed to cro-si-examine him. He admits thit his former boss hai died of heart disease, and that he, Traps, has taken his place. The lawyers s_cent a-crime: did_Traps not *rrid., his boss, Gygix? No, Traps siys, although it is true he wanted to get rid of him. Business is business, and d9g e4E qog.Finally, he is *r-d. to admit that he seduced Gygax's wife, and that when Gygax found out, he had heart failure. But how did Gygax find out? Traps arranged for him to be told, knowing that heart failure would prob- ably be the result. Th. lu*yers are delighted. Here is a perfe-ct:nurder!Jhe p1os.ryt- ing counsei makes a powerful speech in which Traps is depicted-as ]he *Jrt Machiavellian iriminal of the twentieth century. Traps blushes with pleasure. Then the defence counsel rises. To talk of crime is ,orrr.irr., he says. As his client has pointed out, business is business. Traps is no criminal, but an ordinary little Tull ambitious, home- loviirg, not very clever. His worst sini are his infidelities to his wife, but rihat commercial traveller does not commit these? In fact, our human Iives are confused and makeshift; we have to invent our morality as we go along. Traps may hav-e-been indirec-tly responsible for the heath of\"Gygax; trot tiris is i world dominated by chance, and cause and effect ,iJu..y seldom calculated. Traps is no master crimi- nal; Iike the rest of us, he has small virtues and petfy vices; nothing as romantic as the prosecuting counsel suggests. - - This speech infuriates Tiaps. It is not true, he shouts; he is a master .ri*i\"rt. He demands to G sentenced to death. So the fudge ob- iigi\"gty sentences him, and the parfy breaks up in good humour, with .i.rfoir. on the best of terms. TrfPs- t\\en goes to his bedroom and hanjs himself. \\Mhen the iudge finds him, he cries ryith anguish: 'Aliied . . . you've ruined the best evening we've ever had!' Here the rneaning is very plain. Traps lives the same pointless, futile life as the rest\"of us. Sudhenly he sees himself as a superhuman criminal - not a man whose life is dominated by chance, but one who has guided himself step by step with immense certainty.-He pr.efers this \"new vision of himielfi it fiees him from his futility. He is like a lunatic who wants to believe he is Napoleon or Christ. And if believ- ing this involves carrying out on himself the sentence of death, then he prefers to die. At this point, I wish to abandon for a moment the role of literary expositor ind say that the ending of this book strikes me as some- hoiv all wrong. it is confrived, unlike the rest of the tale, which seems realistic\"enough.

And it also reveals a profound and typical aspect of human psychology. '!7e are inclined to accept the ending as the meaning of a story. Our lives may be messy and imperfect and meaningless, but we refuse to accept this, and prefer to see films or read books that give an illusion of 'meaning' by ending neatly. This is why we so admire artists who die young, 'from Keats and Shelley to R.udolph Valentino and |ames Dean. Their death gives an impression of a life neatly rounded off, like the happy ending of a roniantic novel. fhi fbdge, like all Diirrenmatt's work, is a demand to face the disorder of our lives, an attack on specious over-simplification, on'bad faith'. He is writing about the same subjects as Sartre and Camus, but writing of them instinctively, without an intellectual superstructure. In my own book The Age of Defeat, I analysed the work of Sartre and Camus and commented on the exfraordinary penetration of their in- tellectual assessment of our disorder, while finding their pessimism wholly depressing and unsatisfactory. Diirrenmatt, it seems to me, has already found a way out of the impasse of Sartre and Camus. He uses all the traditional analyses of existentialism, the concepts of in- authentic existence, human self-deception, etc., yet with the instinc- tive, mystical optimism of Shaw or Chesterton. If he continues as he has begun, he might, it seems to me, become one of the major figures of twentieth-century writing, an artist who unites in his person some of the greatest currents of his time. At the time of writing, Diirrenmatt is thirty-nine years old - an age at which Shaw had written only the earliest of his plays. Diirrenmatt is the son of a Swiss pastor, who apparently studied phil- osophy and theology at Basle and Zurich; he lives at Neuchitel, and has three children. In Mr Mississippi, he describes himself iokingly as 'this pen-pushing Protestant, this strayed visionary, this lover of grug- some-fabl€S ...' I do not know how far Diirrenmatt regards himseH 214 .{ :ri{ as a member of the Protestant Church, but the rest of the description sfrikes me as wholly apt and accurate. NOTES r. I wish to thank fonathan Crp., the publishers of Drirrenmatt, for allowing meto see four unpublished plays in manuscript. 21'"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Bach, 19 i; I Back to Methuselah (Shaw), 33, 1254,175 Bacon, Francis, 109, 124 Balzac, Honor€ de, 15, 19, 45, 56, 79, g3, gg, 132, 174, lg} Barbusse, Henri, 74,75, 16l Barchester Towers (Trollope), 215 'Baron Corvo', 173 .
