George Orwell said of Henry Miller that there must be millionsof men who think and speak of sex just as crudely, but that the surprising thingis to see it written down. That comment could readily be applied Schaefer.American prisons must be full of men whose view of sex is as brutal and sadisticas Schaefer’s; the astonishing thing is to see it presented in the form ofliterature.Schaefer did his best to perpetuate that view. His stories, he said, weresupposed to be shocking; their purpose was to make people see what real violencewas all about. Many readers, I suspect, will fail to understand what purpose isserved by printing them. Although I see their point, perhaps I can provide ameaningful rationale.When I first read an account of Schaefer’s crimes in True Detective magazine in1974, and learned that the evidence that convicted him consisted of a G numberof sadistic stories that were found in the back of a closet, I felt considerablecuriosity about the stories. Then finally in 1991, when I saw Killer Fictionadvertised in the catalogue of New Jersey bookseller, I ordered it immediately.I found that this collection of Schaefer’s stories, edited by Sondra London,certainly provided an interesting insight into the mind of this most sadisticserial killer. Schaefer fantasizes repetitively about the same thing: picking upa “whore,” taking her to some remote location, then stabbing or hanging her anddefiling her lifeless corpse. So in fact, these early writings cannot be treatedas literature, even of the most primitive order—they are too repetitive. Theonly possible reason to study them is for the insight they afford into thedisordered mind of the sexual psychopath.Technically speaking, based solely on his convictions, Schaefer could not belabeled a serial killer. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1973 for themurder of two girls, Georgia Jessup and Susan Place, whom he killed while he wasout on a $15,000 bail for “kidnapping” and threatening two other young girls.Fortunately, the mother of Susan Place had noted down the license number ofSusan’s date on the evening she disappeared. That license number, beginning witha 4, led the police to the obviously innocent owner of a car in Pinellas County,Florida.Six months after her daughter’s disappearance, Lucille Place happened to bedriving through Martin County when she noticed that all the car license platesbegan with 42. She now re-checked the number she had noted down, substituting 42for 4, and learned that this license belonged to Gerard John Schaefer. Learningthat Schaefer was now in jail for the abduction and assault of two girls, Mrs.Place went to look at Schaefer’s picture, and recognized him as the man who haddriven off with her daughter and Georgia Jessup. Georgia’s purse was found inSchaefer’s room, as were three cartons of papers containing the “killer fiction”that jurors cited in sending him to prison for two life terms. The police werefairly certain by then that Schaefer was responsible for at least twenty otherdead or missing girls, and recent detective work has brought to light sometantalizing connections between the writings Schaefer bills as fiction and somevery real victims.Sondra London describes how, when she was 17, she met a handsome 18-year-oldstudent then known as John Schaefer, who became her first lover. Bright,attractive and personable, she reports that he made quite a presentable escortfor the greater part of a year. But in due course, his darker side emerged as headmitted that at times he was overwhelmed by the violent compulsions of his“inner demons.” In fact, by his own admission (in “False Confessions”) he hadkilled at least seven women before he ever had normal sex with a girl—who maywell have been Sondra London.image [Images/10.jpg]One of the essays he wrote about the time he was dating Sondra concludes: “It istrying to fight the urge to relieve these terrible cravings. I am sure thatthere must be an answer somewhere, and some day I will be cured.” Schaefer wastormented by his obsession with sexualized violence, and seems somewhat wistfulas he tries to wish it all away.Sondra states that she broke off her affair with the budding serial killer notbecause he harmed, abused or threatened her, but because she did not want toserve as his psychiatrist or mother confessor. They parted company after a year,and then nine years later, she learned that he had been convicted of murder.Finally, in 1989, twenty-five years after first meeting him, she wrote to herex-lover in prison, inviting him to collaborate on a book about his life andcrimes.Most prisoners are glad to enter into a correspondence. Prison is a dreary anddemoralizing place, and since human beings can only achieve personal evolutionthrough self-expression, one of the most damaging things about imprisonment isthat the convict’s mind is condemned to stagnation. And so it was that afterbeing isolated from intelligent companionship for the greater part of his adultlife, Schaefer poured considerable energy into his correspondence with the womanwho had once been his closest companion.Although Schaefer’s writing technique showed considerable improvement afterbeing honed by college-level creative writing courses under the Southern Gothicnovelist Harry Crews, his psyche remained fixated at the same coprophilic levelrevealed in the early writings seized by police in 1972.In the spring of 1989, Schaefer began sending London not just repetitive,sadistic fantasies, but also some extremely interesting narratives that appearto be far more factual, with titles like “Flies in Her Eyes” and “FalseConfessions.” It is typical of Schaefer that he modified “confessions” with“false,” so that if challenged, he could claim that it was just a fantasy; healways tried to have it both ways.I have to admit that Schaefer is a far nastier character than Danny Rolling, theGainesville serial killer, to whose autobiography—under this same publisher’simprint—I have also written an introduction. What comes over clearly fromRolling’s book is that, no matter what he has done, Rolling remains afundamentally a decent human being who is as appalled by his heinous acts as hisreaders are.Let me state before we go any further that I am not one of these “bleedingheart” liberals who insist that all criminals are created by their environmentand upbringing, and therefore are not really to blame. I do not believe thisand, frankly, neither do most criminals.At St. Elizabeth’s Hospital New York in 1961, two psychiatrists of that liberalpersuasion, Samuel Yochelson and Stanton Samenow, began to study criminals andended by doing a complete about-turn, finally concluding that criminals areadept self-deceivers whose conduct only changes when they face up to the factthat they are going to spend a lifetime in jail if they go on like this. Theychange by making a conscious choice to do so. But most of them, Yochelson andSamenow found, exhibita “cutoff mechanism” that enables them to pushinconvenient thoughts out of their consciousness. They would, for example,confess frankly at one meeting, then insist they had never said it at the next.Years of research brought Yochelson and Samenow to the conclusion that theessential trait of the criminal mind is a sort of wishful thinking that Sartrecalled mauvais foi, or self-deception.image [Images/11.jpg]I am inclined to dismiss the usual excuses about why criminals commit crimes.Yet one thing is perfectly obvious. The criminal’s background tends to bebasically purposeless. Which means that he will usually allow himself to driftinto situations. This helps to explain why youngsters like Elmer Wayne Henleyand David Brooks, associates of the Houston mass-murderer Dean Corll, can becomekillers without giving it much thought. Most teenagers are bored out of theirminds. And, given a bad family background and a few minor brushes with the law,it is not difficult for a young person to take those first steps toward becominga hardened criminal. It seems to me that Rolling drifted unwittingly intopatterns of criminal behavior in this fashion, but that Schaefer did it far morewillfully and with less of a sense of self-division.At this point, I must make an admission that may seem totally absurd. When Ibegan to write a book called The Occult in 1969, I had no doubt that most of thephenomena reported were the product of nonsensical superstition. With continuousand careful study, however, I came to believe that what we call a “ghost” may bea kind of “tape recording,” which might be the emotional counterpart of anunpleasant smell lingering around the scene of a tragedy. I was also initiallyinclined to believe that poltergeists—“banging ghosts”—are due to psychokinesis,or mind over matter, on the part of emotionally disturbed teenagers. But morethan a decade of study has finally convinced me that ghosts might well representthe spirits of the dead, and that poltergeists, in most cases, are alsodisembodied spirits.My research into thousands of reported cases also came to change my mind aboutso-called “possession.” In the days when I was writing The Occult, I wasconfident that the phenomenon was simply the result of an overheated imaginationfueled by sexual frustration. Two important books by psychiatrists disabused meof that interpretation: Adam Crabtree’s Multiple Man, and Ralph Ellison’s Mindsin Many Pieces. I finally came to accept that there may be some highlyunpleasant entities in the “psychic ether,” that can freely gain access intominds that are already on the same “vibration” or wavelength. This, then, may bethe real meaning behind the Devil’s temptation of Faust and other similarlegends.Danny Rolling readily admits that his mind was already inclined towards negativevibrations, starting with his relationship with an irascible and domineeringfather, and later compounded by problems with his marriage. His first rape wascommitted in a state of rage, misery and self-pity when his wife divorced him,and from then on—as always in such cases—sex crime became steadily easier.Rolling’s belief that, when he committed sex murders, he was taken over by ademonic entity, may be self-deception, but I am now willing to allow for thepossibility that he could be correct.And now, upon reconsidering Killer Fiction, I feel even more strongly that ifever a man “opened” himself to negative forces, it was Gerard John Schaefer.On Feb. 28, 1989, before he started writing the new stories for Killer Fiction,he wrote a letter to Sondra London expressing this awareness, and thendeliberately summoned up the very forces he identified as malignant:The unsettling thing about my fiction is that my most superlative pieces allcentered around a violent theme and then it became a violent theme with sexualtones woven in. I became so accomplished at this violent theme that people wouldread it and believe it was ME rather than a creative exercise. But it ain’tcreative, it’s destructive.I came to realize over the years that thought is energy and in the act ofthinking and transcribing the thought to paper, I was creating an energy patternof murderous violence. The energy pattern is negative and therefore attracts theunseen evil forces that feed off the violent thought.Since I’ve come to understand the matter, I’ve avoided writing murderousfiction. But then I started writing murderous fact.Schaefer claims, in “False Confessions,” that his first murder was accidental,and that he was surprised to find that in “fooling around” with a garrote, hehad killed a girl. If that is true, it was certainly appallingly bad luck—likethe glimpse of a girl undressing that supposedly initiated Ted Bundy’s lifetimeinterest in sex murder. Of course, Schaefer may be fabricating here; but I aminclined to think there is an element of truth in even his most perfervidruminations; if not in a literal sense, certainly in a psychological sense.The problem with young and healthy males is that most of them go around in astate of permanent sexual arousal. I speak quite candidly from my own personalexperience, since during my own teens, from about the age of 13, I was thinkingabout sex more often than not. One advertisement along our school bus route, ofa girl in bra and panties climbing onto a pair of scales (advertising alaxative) never failed to cause a violent stir in my loins; so did every shopwindow full of women’s underwear, as well as every pair of knickers on a clothesline. I was in a continual state of sexual overstimulation, and often walkedaround exhausted from masturbation. But at least my powerful sexual impulsesfound their relief in fantasy and fetishism; there was never the slightesttemptation to commit a sex attack. And when, at the age of 18, I was seduced bya 15 year old girl, and suddenly discovered that it was not difficult topersuade girls to make love, my sexual impulses found a “normal”channel—although the fetishism remained as strong as ever (as I suspect it doesin a large percentage of “normal” men.) My sexual impulse, however, still tendedto be about ten times as strong as convenient, and the mere sight of a girlbending over in a miniskirt was like a kick in the solar plexus that left meshattered and breathless.So I find it perfectly easy to empathize with Rolling or Schaefer to a certainextent. I only have to assume that Schaefer was somehow “imprinted” with theidea of raping “whores” (in the same way that I was imprinted with instantarousal at the sight of a pair of panties—whether on or off a girl) to realizehow easy it must have been to become a sex killer. In the young and oversexedmale the delight of sex seems infinitely sweet—this is, after all, the method bywhich nature deceives us into propagating the species—and most young men wouldwalk a thousand miles to have sex with an attractive girl. Danny Rolling quotesa study in which male college students were asked whether they would rape a girlif they could get away with it, and 90% of them said yes. I personally couldnever have committed rape, because I was too sensitive to the feelings of otherpeople. My equivalent was to commit symbolic rape on a pair of panties from abathroom laundry basket. But if some genie could have been persuaded to presentme with naked girls in a state of drugged sleep, I believe I would have found iteasy enough.So when I read “Gator Bait,” with Schaefer’s description of his sexualexcitement as he spied on the woman sunbathing in her bikini, I can perfectlyunderstand why he committed his first sex attack. But here I notice asignificant difference between Schaefer and my own teenage self. He wants tohumiliate her, to call her a whore, to urinate on her, to pretend he was aboutto penetrate her anus with a knife. Like so many sex criminals, he finds thenotion of sodomy more exciting than normal vaginal penetration, possibly becauseit is more “forbidden.”And the whores fascinate him because, unlike “virtuous girls,” he feels they areinviting degradation, rape, and ultimately murder by being “immoral.” As ayouth, Schaefer’s overdeveloped sexual urges were already focused on real girls,without the possibility of “symbolic rape.” He had also become “imprinted,” forsome reason, on the idea of hanging women.It seems clear that the double assault for which Schaefer received his originalprison sentence was the enactment of a long-standing and often-rehearsedfantasy. We can see that, in spite of having committed a number of murdersalready, he did not reveal himself to be a particularly competent perpetrator inthis case, as he allowed both girls to escape. Schaefer was not living in thereal world, but rather in a world inside his own head, almost as if his crimeswere happening in a book. And in a book like this one, we can see that forSchaefer, writing about a crime was almost as satisfying as committing it. Oncehe got a good fantasy going—like the idea of a black man who is allowed to washand sodomize corpses after execution—he is perfectly satisfied.I have to admit that I have never succeeded in reading Killer Fiction frombeginning to end, and that I am forced to skip hastily through most of hisstories. Schaefer suffers from a kind of halitosis of the soul, and the stenchquickly induces disgust.Again, I try to plumb the depths of his pathology by comparing it with my own.When I was about ten years old, a friend showed me how to catch a tiny wingedinsect like a small dragonflies, pull off the end of its body, then insert atiny privet twig into it. Thrown into the air, it would buzz like a tinyairplane. Yet after doing this for a quarter of an hour or so, I suddenly feltsick. Although they were only insects, I had a distinct sense of doing somethingwrong, and I was never able to bring myself to do it again. I feel the same wayas I read Schaefer. His moral ceiling is so low that I feel suffocated.Why, then, do I write this introduction? Because it seems to me that if it comesdown to a choice between understanding a serial killer and not understandinghim, then I will choose the power of knowledge and understanding over thehelpless vulnerability of ignorance. Schaefer’s writing vividly depicts theappalling urges that drove him to kill, and it seems to me that understandingthe etiology of these atrocities is better than being merely sickened andbaffled by them. On the whole, I am somewhat nostalgic for the days when a booklike this would be sold only to the medical profession, like the originaledition of Krafft-Ebing’s Psychopathia Sexualis in the 1880’s; but since this isthe twentieth century, I must accept that it will reach a wider audience.Books like Wilton Earle’s Final Truth, about the sadistic serial killer Pee WeeGaskins, are in some ways more appalling than Killer Fiction, but they aregenerally available in a cheap paperback form. So, whether we like it or not, itseems that there is no middle course between suppressing this book altogether,and making it available to all who may wish to learn from it.That leaves the question of Schaefer’s perverse psychology. It is quite clearthat his writing is a form of virtual exhibitionism. Regrettably, very little isknown about his upbringing, so it cannot be determined whether anything in hisfamily background gave him (as Jack the Ripper put it) a “down on whores.”Sondra London, who was present in the household, reveals that “his father dranka lot, and abused his mother, whom he revered,” so it sounds as if he sharedcertain contributing factors with Rolling.Schaefer, however, as a Catholic, was steeped in the imagery of the BlessedVirgin and the martyred saints. He attended parochial school, attempted at onetime to become a priest, and by his own account, attended daily mass throughoutmost of his youth. However, this still fails to explain his oddly moralisticposition about “whores.” In many cases, killers who are morbidly obsessed withprostitutes—like the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe—come from a fairlyrespectable (and often Catholic) background. They often find the idea of women“selling themselves” at once disgusting and exciting. It is a well-known factthat many sex killers characterize their victims as “whores,” presumablyproviding a spurious sense of self-justification.It may seem that someone as frankly sadistic as Schaefer would not bother toseek justification; but we only have to look at a story like “Early Release” tosee that Schaefer wrote of his victims as a sadistic Nazi thug would write ofJews. “Danny cringed back against the wall, his delicate fag hands waving beforehim. Cowardly little AIDS-ridden queer…” The sexual psychopath needs to justifyhis own brutality by viewing his victims as evil or degenerate; thus deserving,to his way of thinking, extermination.Schaefer’s attitude towards publicity was also strangely ambivalent. He filedsuit on me because I referred to him in The Serial Killers as a serial killer.Yet the case was thrown out of court, as I knew it would be, because the defensemerely had to draw the judge’s attention to Schaefer’s own boasts of being theworst serial killer of all time.It seems clear that, like so many serial killers, Schaefer was deeply lacking inself-esteem. His murders, then, were based on a fantasy of the power he felt bybeing “in control” of his victims. There is a sense in which we all wish wecould be “in control” of the people in our lives. And, of course, as GeorgeBernard Shaw has observed, we all bid for admiration with no intention ofearning it. But most of us have the sense to realize that we cannot obtain suchadmiration without earning it.Yet even “normal” people often give in to the temptation to obtain admiration orpity by telling lies. The tragedy of such deception becomes apparent in time,and fate takes its revenge as the wheel inevitably turns, placing the victimizerin the position of the victim.I have just finished reading a remarkable biography by James Sloan of the writerJerzy Kosinski, which tragically is not unlike that of the life of a serialkiller.When Kosinski came to America as a student in 1957, he began to tellacquaintances appalling tales of having spent the war alone, wandering aroundPoland; his tribulations included being hung up by his hands from the ceiling bya sadistic landlord, and being hurled into a cesspit by angry peasants becausehe had dropped the host during mass. Some of the people who were enthralled byhis tales of suffering suggested he should write it all down; the result, ThePainted Bird, was an immense literary success. But Kosinski now felt obliged tokeep up the lies, and when his deception was finally exposed, he sank into thedepression which ended in suicide.Kosinski’s story is also relevant here because his work is so full of sadism;even though happily married, he was literally a “sex maniac” who had to go outevery night in search of prostitutes, and it seems clear that he loved tohumiliate women. This sadism is as basic a part of his deformed psyche as hishabitual lying.Such men are clearly victims of the “sexual illusion.” Fetishism is the simplestexample of how sex endows mundane matters with a kind of “magic” that producesdesire. A girl knows that the panties covering her genitalia are merely a pieceof cloth, no more intrinsically exciting than a tea towel. And the young malewho experiences an erection when he sees the panties as she bends over alsoknows, intellectually speaking, that they are merely a garment. Yet somethinglike “another being inside him” responds with excitement and desire.The sexual illusion is obviously vital to the propagation of the human race,whether it takes the crude form of the sex urge, or the romantic form of thebelief that a woman is a kind of goddess. Yet it is of vital importance toremain aware of this element of illusion, and to regard it with a kind of amusedtolerance.Gerard Schaefer seems to have become totally controlled by his own sexualillusions, until they virtually took possession of his soul. In Killer Fiction,Schaefer’s intellectual capacity comes across as flashes of brilliance, but itis clear that he has surrendered so completely to the sexual illusion thatlittle remains of his true humanity. Are such people worth studying? I wouldargue that they are—just as Kosinski is worth studying.As to the contention that in publishing this book, Sondra London is merelyrevealing her own morbid obsession with crime, it seems clear to me that thiscannot be sustained. In the preface to Killer Fiction, she describes how, in1989, she was a technical writer who wanted to write something more interestingthan computer manuals. The fact that her love life had started with an affairwith a serial killer suggested a direction, and the result was the publicationof Killer Fiction and Knockin’ on Joe, which includes interviews with DannyRolling and Henry Lee Lucas’ partner in crime, Ottis Toole, and has gone on tobecome somewhat of a crime classic. It seems to me that with that one bookalone, she was justified in abandoning technical writing. And I certainlybelieve that the autobiography she co-authored with Danny Rolling, The Making ofa Serial Killer, is an important book, which will continue to be studied bycriminologists for years to come.Although Killer Fiction may be dismissed by the casual reader as gratuitouslyoffensive, still it strikes me as a worthwhile addition to the literature ofcriminal psychology. Law enforcement and psychiatric professionals, as well aslaymen who sincerely seek to understand the sick urges that result in thesenseless slaughter of innocent strangers, cannot afford to ignore theseconfessions.With this volume, the late Gerard John Schaefer, however we may judge him as aperson, has certainly left his mark on the literature of true crime."},{"pageContent":"THE SERIAL KILLER WHO LOVED MEBY SONDRA LONDONRogue cop GJ Schaefer,Lady-killer, baby-raper,Fallen angel, voice from hell,Found slaughtered in his cell.Killer fiction, killer factScripted his own final act.Criminal justice took his lifeBy enigmatic bloody knife.Infamy inscribed his name.Thus inevitably slainThe killer victim on the floorWill perpetrate—nevermore.CRIMINAL JUSTICEGerard John Schaefer was hacked to death in his cell at Florida State Prison onSunday morning, December 3, 1995.Found by guards an hour later, his blood-drenched body had sustained over 40stab wounds, predominantly about the head and neck. Chaingang legend has it thatone of his eyeballs was found on the yard, but a prison official who inspectedthe body after hearing the same story himself said that both eyes were stillintact. Take your pick.Vincent Rivera was charged with the murder on February 1, 1996, but a year Glater, the heavily-muscled 34-year-old confessed double murderer with a yen todie in the electric chair says they have the wrong man.Psychiatrist Dr. Melvyn Gardner says Rivera has “the highest potential forhomicide of any person I have ever examined.” With 46 disciplinary infractionssince his incarceration in 1991, Rivera regularly disobeys direct orders.Blood-stained clothes and a makeshift shank were taken into evidence, and bloodypalmprints found at the scene were preserved pending further investigation. The news of Schaefer’s demise affected me as if a fetid miasma had drifted outthe window of my life.THE CLASSIC CASEThe term serial killer was coined by Robert Ressler, the retired FBI agent whohelped form the world-renowned Behavioral Science Unit. In his book WhoeverFights Monsters, Ressler cites a classic case:In our road shows, when I used to display the slides and give the lecture aboutthe organized offender Gerard John Schaefer, someone in my audience would accuseme of having taken the characteristics of that sort of offender right from thedetails of Schaefer’s case. That’s not so, but it is true that the patternsassociated with the organized killer are starkly apparent in this instance.Even though he uses Schaefer to exemplify the organized type of serial killer,in a private conversation with this author Ressler reviewed the technicalitiesinvolved in defining Schaefer’s status:I cannot say Schaefer actually was a serial killer, as we go by the record. Bymy own definition, a serial killer commits at least four murders, in fourseparate events, precipitated by fantasy, and separated by an emotionalcooling-down period. Now, by law, Schaefer had only been convicted of twomurders which were done at the same time, so technically, he didn’t fit thedefinition. But everything else did fit—the background, the fantasies, thepsychological characteristics, the additional crimes he was suspected of—and sofar as I’m concerned, the only thing that kept Schaefer from being labeled aserial killer was the inability of law enforcement to catch up with him.Since no one knows a subject better than its originator, it is significant thatout of thousands of cases, Ressler chose Schaefer to illustrate every salientfeature of the organized serial killer. However, neither Ressler nor any otherexpert in serial murder knew Schaefer as well as I did, because they have nevereven met the man. I have gone much further than that.A REAL LADY KILLERAt a high school dance in 1964, before my eyes materialized a dazzling youngstranger—a tall, smiling blond, dressed to good advantage in a ruffled bluedress shirt that complemented his brilliant blue eyes and a white sports coatthat set off his deepwater tan. Proverbially, he caught my eye across thecrowded room and soon we were exchanging words over the punchbowl. So poised, socourteous, so articulate!The handsome stranger was unable to get my number that night, but I did give himmy full name, and the next day he hit the phone book, trying every phone numberlisted under that name until he found me and asked me out. I was flattered bythe attention at the time, but looking back I realize that was an indication ofhow thorough and persistent he could be when tracking down a female that excitedhim. It was the first time I knew what it was like to be pursued by a serialkiller.At 18, John Schaefer was one year older than I was. A bright, well-manneredCatholic boy whose family belonged to the local yacht club, he became my closestcompanion over the next year. We were in love. My parents were glad I had metsuch a nice boy, and invited him to go along with us on our summer vacation. Iremember how we whiled away the hours out on my grandmother’s old porch swing,shucking peas and shooting the breeze, good-ole-boy style. I can still see himholding up his hands for my grandmother to wind her knitting yarn, patientlylistening to her long, rambling tales and laughing easily at her corny jokes. Myaunts adored him, commenting openly on how pleasant and polite he was. Even mydemanding father approved of him.After supper we might ramble through an old graveyard, philosophizing about theancient dead before making love amongst the tombstones. Those early days remainin my mind like a bubble memory—how well he treated me, how sensitive he was,and how sweetly we loved each other. Many times he held my life in his hands, ashe took me into the tangled wilderness of the Everglades, or out on the highseas in his daddy’s motorboat. But after a year, as young lovers will, we wentour separate ways. I thought I’d never see him again.Then in 1972 came the screaming headlines: “6 Dead, 28 May Be,” and the ghoulishstories about the smiling cop turned sadistic killer and corpse-loving fiend,hoarding mementos of his mutilated victims, and writing it all up in feverishprose. Absolutely unbelievable! I was appalled that crimes like this could becommitted by anyone, much less someone I had known intimately. Remember, thosewere the days before the term “serial killer” existed, before Ted Bundy, JohnWayne Gacy, and Jeffrey Dahmer so irrevocably showed us what it meant. In thosedays, Schaefer’s type of crime was not only unnamed, it was unheard-of.Frightened by what had become of my baby-faced dream, I was haunted by questionswith unthinkable answers. Did I lose my virginity to a real lady-killer? And howcould it be possible for the sweet boy I had held in my arms to be a homicidalmaniac?As shocked as I was, I’d always wondered about my first lover. Gentle and sweet,bright and polite, he was unfailingly eager to please. There was nothingabnormal about our youthful affair; he was a sensitive and enthusiastic lover.Yet as I searched my mind for clues to the monstrous entity he had become, Irecalled the signs of danger. I had been too inexperienced to realize what I wasseeing when I was involved with him as a teenager, but once I heard about themurders, looking back I remembered how he had been haunted by violent urges andtwisted emotions.When I first met him, he told me his last girlfriend could only get off when hewould play-rape her, rip her clothes off, talk dirty and force sex on her. I lethim know I was not like that. He assured me he didn’t get off on it either, heonly did it to please her. He promised not to treat me that way, and to hiscredit, he never did. Perhaps I would have seen a different side of him from thebeginning if I had responded differently.According to the last few letters he sent me, he had been cultivating a secretlife of sexual perversion and violence even while he was going steady with me.That would explain why his legitimate sex-life was apparently so free ofdeviance.Hiding the compulsive violence from friends, family members and coworkers isessential to maintaining the lifestyle of the serial killer. I remember the dayI pulled him off his father, who in his usual drunken haze, had called hismother a whore. In defense of his mother’s honor, John went after his fatherwith a golf club, cracking him soundly over the head, and the two men werelocked in what could have easily been mortal combat as I followed them out ofthe kitchen and into the carport, begging John to stop. Another time undersimilar circumstances, he had given his father a concussion with a bottle ofbarbecue sauce.I have no first-hand knowledge placing my young boyfriend at the scene of anymurder. I never saw him kill anything but squirrels, birds and fish. But themurderous intent I saw in his eyes as we stood out in his front yard onesummer’s eve was unmistakable. He pointed out a certain window on an upstairsbedroom in a house two doors down. Cheeks flushed and eyes simmering with rage,he told me how a girl we both knew enjoyed flaunting her naked charms at himthrough that window. “What a slut!” he spat. His eyes narrowed as he vowedthrough clenched teeth, “I’ll put a stop to that.”When Schaefer was arrested, among his collection women’s jewelry, teeth, andID’s was a dainty gold locket engraved in curly old-fashioned script with asingle word that tells an eloquent tale to one who knows how to read it. Thelegend engraved on that gold locket says simply, “Leigh.”image [Images/20.jpg]Her name was Leigh Hainline. I was not a close friend, but I did go to schoolwith her. She was known as Leigh Bonadies when she turned up dead, and theaddress listed was across town, but it was the same girl Schaefer had beenwatching for years. His name did come up in the investigation, but prosecutorshad been unable to find enough evidence to bring charges.Ironically, only months before Schaefer’s grim demise, Tim Bronson, HomicideChief of the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department had re-opened the Hainline/Bonadies case, along with those of Belinda Hutchens and Carmen Hallock, twoother women whose pitiful belongings had been found in Schaefer’s possession.Bronson had hoped to conclusively link Schaefer to these murders.Years later when I asked Schaefer what happened to Leigh, his laconic reply wasboth a confession and a threat: “When you fuck with the bull, you get the horn.”Schaefer was only nineteen years old when he told me how he struggled with theurge to kill another woman who lived on his street, whom he angrily accused offlaunting herself at him as she sunbathed in her back yard. We were out on thebeach right across from Bahia Mar one windy night in 1965 cuddled up closetogether under an old Army blanket as he wept with dismay describing how he hadplanned to murder the sunbather, whom he had already taken to calling a whore,although he knew the woman had a full-time job and kissed her dates good-bye atthe front door when they brought her home. He knew that from hiding and watchingin the darkness, stoking his rage and stroking his sex, as his fantasiescoalesced into plans. He had all his supplies stashed in the back of his oldgreen Ford station-wagon: the baseball bat, the blanket, the ropes, the chains,the gun, and the concrete blocks.He was going to hit her over the head with a baseball bat and knock her out,quickly wrap her unconscious body in a blanket and tie her up with her rope,drive the wagon down to the dock at the end of the street, load the bundle ontohis daddy’s boat and run her out to the Everglades, where he would shoot her inthe head and“she’d be gator bait by morning.” He was sure he could get away with it. “Nobody, no crime,” was the way he put it to me that night. The same phrases heuttered when was just nineteen would be repeated down through the years like agrim litany as the budding fleurs du mal blossomed into full-blown flowers ofevil.image [Images/21.jpg]Although he never did kill his neighbor, a graphic account of the how heactually did sexually assault her later surfaced in a nasty little piece of workcalled “Gator Bait.”About this same time, he confided in Betty Owen, his creative writing teacher,tearfully telling the middle-aged woman that he was obsessed with the urge tokill one of the younger female teachers. She referred him to the schoolcounselor, who told me years later that it was to his everlasting regret that hehad recognized the homicidal tendencies in the youth, but had been powerless tohelp him.Not long after my young boyfriend broke down in tormented tears over hismurderous urges, I told him it was over, dropping him flat without turning back.I don’t remember ever feeling afraid of him. I was just tired of being draftedinto battle with his demons and I didn’t want to be his therapist.After I broke up with him, he sent me melodramatic poems with silly images like“the ships of hope that had no hulls,” and told me he would hide and watch whenI came home from dates with my new boyfriend. “I’ll get you back,” he promised.At the time I took his parting shot to mean he wanted me back as a girlfriend,but time has revealed the ominous undertones of that ambiguous phrase.Eventually Schaefer moved on to other interests, and as the years passed I puthim as far out of my mind as I could. But as hard as I tried, I could not escapethe somber knowledge that I was alive while so many of the women who had knownhim were not.I found myself scrutinizing the faces of rosy-cheeked blue-eyed strangers,wondering, “Is that him? Is that how he’s changed over the years? Is he out ofjail already? Has he come looking for me? Is he still mad at me for leavinghim?” I’d be on edge until I could determine that the stranger didn’t recognizeme, because I knew that if it really were him, he’d know me instantly; I wouldsee the flash of recognition in his eyes.A GOOD SCAREIt was a blistering hot Saturday in July of 1972, a good day for the beach, andNancy Trotter, 17, and Paula Sue Wells, 18, had planned on catching some rays sothey’d have something to show for their trip. Paula, better known as Sue, wasfrom Texas and Nancy was from Illinois. They had been vacationing in Stuart,Florida for just two days. They were going to catch a ride to the beach with thesmiling young sheriff’s deputy they’d met the day before.When Nancy and Sue first met Jerry Schaefer, the uniformed cop had been drivinghis squad car. He told them he’d give them a ride to the beach if they’d meethim at the bandshell at 9:30 A.M. the next day.But when he pulled up to the bandshell in his battered baby-blue Datsun onSaturday, July 22, he was dressed in shorts and a sport shirt. He’d beenswitched to plainclothes duty, he explained, and was just doing observations.Because they knew he was a cop, they jumped right in his car, never stopping towonder what he planned on observing.Marion County Sheriff Richard Crowder was using his day off to mow the lawn,when his wife called him to the phone. It was Deputy Sheriff Jerry Schaefer, andhe said it was important, as Sheriff Crowder described it to me one day in hisoffice. “‘I’ve done something terrible,’ he said. ‘You’re really going to be madat me this time.’ I asked him, well, what was it, and he told me he had arresteda couple of girls and had tied them up but they had got away. So I told him tocome on in and report to his shift captain, and I got in my car and went outlooking for the girls. I found both of them still in handcuffs, one of themswimming across the river, and the other one walking along the road. Schaeferwent on in and turned himself in. Now, he was convicted on that one, and he wentto jail for it, but while he was out on bail, it looked like he got ahold ofanother couple of girls and this time, he killed them.”The day after the assault, Nancy and Sue, covered with bruises, scratches andinsect bites, described their day at the beach with Officer Schaefer. In aninterview with State’s Investigator Littman, Nancy described how it all began.“Well, he started driving towards Jensen beach, and he asked us if we wanted tosee an old Spanish fort that was on the river, and we said OK, you know,” saidNancy. “And so he was driving down, and then he pulled in this dirt road, that’swhen I started getting worried. He kept going back further and further…”Sue continued, “I got worried, because he had told us the day before when hepicked us up, not to tell anyone, you know, he emphasized it several times, notto tell anyone a policeman was taking us out there. I got worried when he turneddown that road, because it seemed awfully suspicious.”Nancy described how Schaefer parked the car at the Spanish fort and they all gotout. Schaefer thoughtfully sprayed the girls with insect repellent beforeescorting them around the fort. “Then we went to get back in the car and, uh, wejust sat there, and then he looked at us and he said, ‘Why did you girls lie tome yesterday?’ you know, and we were shocked. And we said, ‘About what?’ and hestarted, “Well, I checked up on you in Juvenile Court,” and he said he hadcalled up there and that we were runaways.”After explaining to Investigator Littman that it wasn’t true, Nancy continued,“We both started laughing, you know, runaways, it sounded kind of funny. And Itold him, I said, ‘I’m not a runaway, my mother knows where I am and I’meighteen and it wouldn’t matter anyways…’”Sue picked up, “Then he asked us if we wanted a free ride home, and we said,‘We’re not ready to go home, we want to stay another week.’ And he said, ‘Well,I’m sorry, but you have to go home anyway. Your parents are worried about you,and they want you to come home, and you’re runaways. And if you resist, I’ll putyou under arrest.’ And so we figured, well, we don’t want to be put underarrest, you know, a free ride home, OK, you know? So then he said, ‘Do you haveany dope on you?’ and we said ‘No,’ and he said, ‘Get out of the car.’”The girls described how he made them stand outside the car while he went throughNancy’s purse. Then, Sue continued: “He asked me if I had anything on me, and Isaid I do, then he said, ‘Well, what do you wear?’ and I told him, and he said,‘Do you wear any underwear?’ and I told him no. So he said, ‘Well, I can’tsearch you because that’s illegal, but there’s one thing I can do,’ and he gotin his car, and that’s when he got the handcuffs out.”When he asked Nancy what she was wearing, she told him she had on a bathing suitunderneath her clothes. “So he said, ‘Well, I’m placing you two under arrest forrunaways,’ and he handcuffed us behind our backs.”Then Sue described how she told him, ‘“Well, may I laugh? This is really funny,’and he said, ‘Sure, go ahead and laugh,’ so we just started giggling and then hesaid, ‘Y’all think this is a big joke, you just don’t know how serious it reallyis.’”But they were soon to find out. Schaefer put the girls back in the car,handcuffed behind their backs. They thought he was going to take them back tothe police station, but he told them they were going to sit right there. Heasked them numerous questions about the halfway house they’d given as anaddress, and he wanted to them to tell him all they knew about Stuart, withparticular emphasis on where they were getting their dope. They told him they’donly been there two days and they didn’t have any dope. For 45 minutes, they satin the sweltering midsummer heat handcuffed in the back seat of Schaefer’s dingyDatsun, listening to him rant about dope and related topics.“And then he started talking about white slavery,” said Sue.“He asked us how we’d like to be sold into white slavery,” explained Nancy. “Hesaid it ought to be a nice experience, you could really see the world, go toSouth America or South Africa and be a white slave…then he said, ‘Would youscrew me for $150?’ and I said, ‘No, not for all the money in the world,’ and hesaid ‘If you were a white slave, you’d be doing it for free.’ Then he goes, ‘Howwould you like that, Sue? How would you like that?’“So we just quit talking to him.”“Then he started estimating how much he could get for us,” said Nancy.“And he started asking about our parents, if they knew where we were, and did wethink they’d put up a ransom for us.”“And I told him my parents would try to scrape up the money, I mean, they’re notthat well-off, but…” Sue hesitated, then came back, “And then he started inabout the white slavery again, and he kept saying he had a friend he could sellwhite girls to.”Then Nancy Trotter mentioned the same theory Schaefer had described to me sevenyears earlier. “He was telling us how people disappeared, and there’s no crimewithout a victim, it’s just a missing person when they don’t have a body.” Howmany other women heard Schaefer recite that sinister motto? And where are thosewomen now?Paula Sue Wells was still in shock, and her mind had already begun the healingprocess of suppressing as much of her ordeal as she could, but as she and Nancyrelived it for Investigator Littman, it started to come back. “Yes, now Iremember. I hadn’t thought about it till now, but he said he’d kill us and buryus in a hole real deep and cover us up and nobody would ever find us.”“And all we’d be was a missing person,” said Nancy. “I thought all this was toscare us into telling who had the dope in the city, but we were both confused.We couldn’t see what it was all for.” But the confusing chat in the car wasdrawing to a close. Now it was time for action.“He had us get out of the car,” Nancy said, “We were still handcuffed, and hegot my blanket and made us go over in the field.”Sue continued, “He went to his car and got the key to his trunk, you know, and Isaw everything then. He had a bunch of ropes and rags and stuff to tie us upwith, and he said, ‘We’re going to go out in back here in the bushes, and y’alldon’t run away.’ and, ‘Can I trust you to stay here while I go get my friend?’”“Yes, and he wanted us not to scream, too,” interjected Nancy.“So then he took us back in the bushes and laid the blanket down, and gaggedboth of us, and he told me to lay down on the blanket, but I didn’t lay down. Ijust stood there. And then he tied my legs up and said he was going to separateus and tie us up in different places. And he told me not to try to get awaybecause if I did he would kill me, he’d catch up with me and kill me. And thenhe told me not to scream, because he said if I screamed, he’d come back and wrapthe gag around me so tight I would shit in my pants.”There you have it. Sue had mentioned Schaefer’s signature. His fantasiesconsistently revolved around the moment when the female victim is so terrifiedshe defecates. If she doesn’t do it before her death, then she can always bemade to produce this thrilling effect in the course of being murdered. Hisfantasies were predominantly scatological to the end, and the imagery ofdefecation was bound to surface in any crime he committed. In the parlance oflaw enforcement, this signature would be appear as Schaefer’s “ritual,” sincethat feature was employed solely for his own personal gratification. Thepragmatic approach of qualifying his potential victims beforehand and thencarefully disposing of their corpses afterwards would be his “M.O.” because hedid it in order to avoid apprehension.Sue went on to describe how Schaefer had gagged and bound her hand and foot asshe stood there handcuffed in the trees.Meanwhile, Nancy had just been standing there gagged and cuffed. “Then he tookme over to the river and had me stand up, and he tied my feet together with therope, and then he redid my gag, cause it was falling off. And he had me stand onthe root of a tree and he made a noose around my neck, put a rope around myneck, and hung it over a branch of the tree, and he tied the other end down ontoa branch, a stub that was sticking out. Then he started, like you know, a scene.Like, please don’t do it here, there’s too many mosquitoes, and I was crying andhe didn’t do anything. And then he started, he pinched me, you know. And I gotreal disgusted, and I said ‘Don’t,’ and he said, ‘I could just take your pantsoff righ there,’ and he started…”“Where was he pinching you?” asked Littman.“On the butt,” Nancy replied. “And then he started to go for my zipper, but Iturned around. And he just laughed, and he didn’t do anything. And I started tofall off this root. If I fell off this root I would have hung. I started fallingoff and choking, and he just, he pushed me back up and sat me on there, and hewarned me not to scream. And then he left me.”Nancy described how she chewed the noose around her neck, then crawled up theroot and untied the rope from the stump. After that she had to do a backbend tountie her legs, as she was still handcuffed, but she did manage to undo themundone and escape.Meanwhile, Sue had maneuvered her way out of the ropes on her legs, but shestill had the gag in her mouth when Schaefer came back. “He said, ‘I’m going totie you up to a tree now, so that if you try to get loose, you’ll hangyourself,’” Then Schaefer helped her to her feet, and picked up the blanket.Carrying a long rope and the blanket he set off for the river. “I couldn’t walkvery fast cause of the stickers, and he kept saying, ‘Hurry up, hurry up!’ and Ikept saying, ‘Well, I have stickers in my feet, wait and let me try to get themout.’”Apparently Schaefer couldn’t wait, because he picked Sue up and threw her overhis shoulder, carrying her to a tree, where he trussed her up much like he hadNancy, except this time it wasn’t a root she stood on, it was a slope. “He tiedmy legs up, then he ran a rope up from behind, from my ankles up, and tied it tothe handcuffs. And then I had to spit the gag out, and he said, ‘How did you dothat?’ And he put it on real tight, and I felt like I was going to black out. SoI said ‘Loosen it, it’s hurting me,’ so he loosened it up a little, and he tiedme to the tree and all, and then he said, ‘Do you have VD?’ And I said, ‘No,’because I was afraid. I really thought he was going to sell us, and I was afraidif I told him I had VD, he wouldn’t, and he’d have no use for me, so he’d killme…Then he picked up my shirt and looked down my pants and he just laughed. Thenhe said, ‘Don’t scream, and don’t try to run away cause I’m not going to be veryfar down the road, I’m just going down the road to meet that man that’s going tobuy you,’ and I said, ‘Why do you want to sell us?’ and he said, ‘For the money,I’d do anything for money,’ and I said, ‘Well, that’s wrong,’ you know. And Iwas going to talk to him, that’s before he gagged me, when I was trying to talkto him. He said, ‘Don’t lecture me, sweetheart. I didn’t bring you here for alecture.’ Then after that, he tied me up, and before he left he said, ‘Don’t tryto run away,’ and then he walked off, and I started getting loose. And I foundNancy walking down the road…”image [Images/26.jpg]Nancy cut in, “Yes, I had gotten loose, and…”“He didn’t come back to check on you then?” Littman asked Nancy.“No,” she explained. “I went up on back of that Spanish fort and I saw his carstill there. So I ran back by the river and I saw Sue in the trees, and she wascalling, ‘Nancy, Nancy’ but I thought he was there making her call me, I thoughthe saw I was gone. So I didn’t say anything. I started going faster down by theriver, and it sounded like someone was following me, so I started running, and Itook up on land, and hid in this overgrowth for about a half an hour…I got eatenalive by mosquitoes…”Nancy told of struggling through the underbrush and the woods, and then walkingalong the river until she saw a road on the other side. Handcuffed, she managedto swim through the river to the other side, where Sheriff Crowder picked herup.image [Images/27.jpg]“After I saw Nancy, I was afraid to yell for her again,” said Sue, “because Iwas afraid he had just left a couple of minutes ago, and I still had the nooseon my neck and part of the rope on my feet.” After she got free from the ropes,she ran through the woods and the river, still gagged and handcuffed, her armsbound with a scarf. “I found a dirt road, and I ran down it and I was crying,and this man stopped in a pickup truck and then the policeman came.”Robert Ressler analyzes Schaefer’s crime:Before going further with the story, let me point out the attributes of theorganized offender that are present so far in the narrative. The abductorpersonalized the victims by talking with them, used his own vehicle, and connedthe women into his car by means of his verbal skills. He brought his ownthreatening weapon to the scene and took it away with him, had a rape kit, andwas plainly planning to complete sexual acts with the women prior to torture andmurder. After the murder, he was going to hide and dispose of the bodies. Hedisplayed mobility and adaptive behavior during the crime when he left the womentied up and went to pay attention to some other aspect of his life, telling themthat he would return and finish them off later.Schaefer always avoided discussing this nearly-lethal assault case, because hedisliked the inevitable conclusion that the similarities between the doubleassault and the double murder were both numerous and significant. Still, whenpressed by Steve Dunleavy in 1991, his eyes sparkled for A Current Affair as hesmirked, “It was an emotional intimidation type of a thing,” and then laughedout loud. “Oh, it gave them a good scare, no doubt about that.”Physically painful torture wasn’t necessary to gratify his sadistic compulsionson this occasion. Just from knowing the fear his victims suffered, he derivedthat desperately twisted feeling of sexualized power he had learned to crave andcould achieve no other way. Schaefer persuasively described the pleasure hederived from experiments in terror like these:My own preference was in the preliminaries, and the increasing terror generatedby the woman’s awareness that she was in the hands of a homicidal maniac. I wasentranced by the various ploys that the captive women would use in order to savetheir lives. Most of them would try something, and I made it a game to see howlong it would be before the victim would request to be killed.This entertainment varied from one victim to another, and it might take the formof physical or psychological torture. If and when the lady decided to say she’dhad enough, I was quite willing to put her out of her misery—if she askednicely. This sort of experiment is perfect for a person of sadistic tendencies,since we sadists do not consider our victims to be genuinely human. Ted neverthought of the women he killed as persons, but only as objects. I did the sameand found it an excellent way to avoid any human feeling for them. I guess onewould consider that a sociopathic quality, but what the hell, we all have ourfaults, and I am no different than anyone else in that respect.DOING DOUBLESThe double life terms Schaefer was serving when he was killed were for themurders of two teenage girls—the blonde Susan Place and the brunette GeorgiaJessup. They were chopped to pieces and buried some time between July of 1992,when Nancy and Sue were assaulted, and January of 1973, when Schaefer wasfinally locked up for good.Schaefer compared his crimes to those of his arch-rival, Ted Bundy:Ted was, of course, a tyro when he nabbed Ott and Naslund; when nabbed Jessupand Place I had been in the ghoul game for almost 10 years, so I knew what toexpect from these juicy young creatures at the end. By then I was into doingdouble murders and an occasional triple when the opportunity arose, whereas Tedat the same point of time was only able to handle singles. He was playing atcopycat and doing a poor job of it at that.Doing doubles is far more difficult than doing singles, but on the other hand italso puts one in a position to have twice as much fun. There can be some livelydiscussions about which of the victims will get to be killed first. When youhave a pair of lively teenaged bimbolinas bound hand and foot and ready for asession with the skinning knife, neither one of the little devils wants to bethe one to go first. And they don’t mind telling you quickly why their bestfriend should be the one to die.image [Images/29a.jpg]image [Images/29b.jpg]image [Images/29c.jpg]Schaefer delighted in courting the perverse status only the most heinous ofcrimes convey—while insisting that he was an innocent man who deserved to bereleased. From boasts of one-upping Bundy he would go to flat deadpan denial:“I’ve never killed anyone, period.”Schaefer’s appeals were rejected twenty times, all the way up to the UnitedStates Supreme Court. Undeterred, he continued to promote the theory that he wasguilty of nothing more than writing realistic fiction, and that he could not belinked to the scene of any murders anywhere—not even the two he was convictedof. His conviction, he contended, stemmed from an elaborate conspiracy requiringthe cooperation of the prosecution, the defense, the judge, the media, the FBI,the victims’ families, the State Department of Motor Vehicles, and lawenforcement officers in at least six jurisdictions.But his mind was filled with sexually violent fantasies that consistentlyfeatured someone very much like himself playing the homicidal maniac. Thesekinds of morbid obsessions typically start the cycle that culminates when thevicious dreams become real, and somebody winds up dead.It’s not just the two assaults and two murders he was convicted of, it’s thegirls like Leigh Hainline, whose memories were kept alive in the form of thepitiful little trophies he took from them. It’s the nameless ones who became“gator bait by morning.” You can hear their voices echoing through his prose—theknown ones, the unknown ones, and the ones that got away. Like me. But I’m notsinging the song he put in my mouth. Not any more.BURNING WITH A BLUE FLAMEThe work that appears in this volume began on February 8, 1989 when I addresseda letter to Gerard John Schaefer in his maximum security cell at Florida StatePrison, asking if he remembered me.“How could I not remember you?” he gushed. “A former great love of my life, butthen I always burn with a blue flame when it’s a romance. Did burn. Sure ain’tno romance to be had in here.”Telling him I had become a freelance writer, I asked if he’d like to work on abook about his life with me. “I’ve been approached by about a dozen writers; afew of them I’ve even talked contract with, but in the end I’ve never concludeda deal. My position is that any book about my case or life must be truthful andaccurate as to facts, and none of this “police sources suspect” bullshit. Inplain words—no hocus pocus.” He continued, “The story about my case has not beendone. It’s virgin territory, a virtual terra incognita.” Then in a cozy aside,he allowed, “Naturally, I’m favorably disposed toward someone who has known meintimately.”I asked if he was still mad at me for breaking up with him. “As Neil Sedaka usedto croon, ‘Breaking Up is Hard to Do,’ and I have some painful emotionalmemories about us, but nothing you’d classify as hostile.” He concluded, “Socialstuff can go on the back burner. You want to write a book and I’m uncommitted asyet, so to get things going in the right direction, sit down and give me yourpitch on exactly what you have in mind.” My proposal persuaded him I was up tothe job, and thus our collaboration began.As I sat and talked with Schaefer in prison during a series of personal visitsin 1990 and 1991, his physical presence reminded me of John D. MacDonald, theFlorida novelist who wrote so hard but looked so soft. Schaefer had long sincelost those movie-star good looks that had once dazzled me so. The man who wouldcharacterize himself as “a former street cop who is in open population inperhaps America’s most repressive hellhole” was a nebbish: portly, pale,balding, and half-blind. Though he would portray himself in the most macho lightpossible, stressing, “I walk the yard like a man,” my impression was that he nomore resembled a killer than he did a cop. More like a middle-aged, deskboundclerk gone to seed.I had always known Schaefer to be well-spoken and pleasant, funny and smart—aneducated, cultivated man with many attractive qualities. And incongruous thoughit might seem, he still retained much of the polish of his background. Afterall, not only had he graduated from police academy, he had taken college-levelcourses in creative writing under Harry Crews, and acquired a B.S. degree fromFlorida Atlantic University in criminal justice. He had always exhibited acertain class consciousness, and a score of years behind bars had not made himany less of a snob. Even though his daily existence was proof enough that he wason the same level as his neighbors, still he patronized them as “nothing but abunch of ignorant niggers and white trash.” You would think he was just visitingthe prison conducting research to continue his studies in criminal justice.Even though his demeanor was superficially civilized, still at times he could bequite chilling. It was not the man himself. It was the shadowy entity lurkingjust out of sight, the treachery and deception hidden by an unassuming demeanorthat exemplified what Hannah Arendt called “the banality of evil.”In accommodation, I developed a multi-faceted interface. I found myself havingmore than one relationship with him at a time, a curious experience to be sure.I caught more than a glimpse of his dark side. I saw it in his threats and hiscruelty, his deceptiveness and destructiveness. Then there was the ambiguity ofthat ever-present smile. I learned about the cannonade of rage disarmed by hissmiling facade. And I finally came to understand the puritanical rage thatflared up when a woman shook her naked assets in his face.image [Images/32a.jpg]image [Images/32b.jpg]image [Images/32c.jpg]image [Images/32d.jpg]image [Images/32e.jpg]THE GUILTY MINDThe most intriguing aspect of Gerard John Schaefer’s case was the fact thatwritings found in his closet were used to convict him. While it was not allegedthat these fragmentary notes actually describe the murders, they were introducedon the legal principle of mens rea, or the guilty mind, as they portrayed hismurderous intent with chilling accuracy. Indeed, one of the jurors stated flatlythat it was these closet fantasies that persuaded him to convict.“The psychiatrist told him to write down everything that went through his mind,”said Mrs. Doris Schaefer, his mother. “It was supposed to help him somehow.”After being arrested for the assaults on Nancy Trotter and Paula Sue Wells, hestarted writing again. Emerson Floyd was Schaefer’s cellmate for his first sixweeks in the Martin County Jail, where he had been confined since January 15,1973. Floyd told reporters that Schaefer spent most of his time writing.“He wouldn’t show it to us,” he said. “He’d lay in his bunk and write and thenhe’d read his writing to us. It was mostly just brutal. I tell you, there weresome hair-raising things.”Whatever Schaefer wrote during those early days of incarceration will remainanother one of the unsolved mysteries of this case. On April 1, 1973, whenSchaefer heard that the bodies of Susan Place and Georgia Jessup had been found,Floyd said he stopped telling his brutal stories to his cellmates. “He cut hisstories up in tiny pieces and dropped them in the wastebasket.”Once I learned how integral Schaefer’s stories were to his case, I could nothelp but wonder. An unwitting Pandora, I asked him, “Do you still write thosestories?” In reply, he began firing off a series of searing scenarios of sexualhomicide that went so far beyond accepted standards that for a while I wassimply reeling. I had no idea what to do with this stuff.Then I received his account of shoptalk with Ted Bundy, describing how Ted hadseen the news stories about Schaefer and recognized his face from the picturesin detective magazines. Schaefer wrote, “I was once billed as The Greatest MassMurder of Women This Century,’ and that is no small statement. It’s a real goodticket into the society of fiends.” After describing a discussion of techniquesand preferences, Schaefer wrote that Bundy “couldn’t get enough of conversationlike that. It was like he felt I knew for sure there was a real boring side ofDeath work, and it wasn’t all raging sexual release, as the media likes toportray it.”“That’s IT!” I literally jumped up and raced to my office, without evenfinishing the letter. I didn’t know what he was going to write, but from thatmoment on, I decided I was going to publish it.Between March and July of 1989, Schaefer sent me the stories included in twosections of Killer Fiction, “Whores” and “Starke Stories.” Selections from thestories and drawings used as evidence in his 1973 murder trial are included inthe section, “Actual Fantasies.” A limited edition of the volume comprisingthese three sections was copyrighted and published in June of 1989.After Killer Fiction was finalized, another batch of stories pushing furtherinto the reality zone was released as Beyond Killer Fiction, including storiesas graphic as titles like “Flies in Her Eyes” and “Blonde on a Stick” seem tosuggest.“I’m not writing non-fiction,” explained the literary madman. “It’s killerfiction: a new genre, where the writer takes violence as an artistic medium andinstead of glorifying it, makes the reader see it as the cruel and horrid act itis in reality. I don’t represent violence as good or bad, merely as it is. I letthe reader conclude that violence is a socially negative force, not to bereveled in.” Thus he expounded his grim postmodern aesthetic.Later on he penned what he called a “killer serial,” a dozen or soloosely-connected stories relating the adventures of Detective Dan Kelly, RogueCop, satirizing the myth that had grown up around his own case and caricaturingvarious individual who had encountered him, including myself, the real DetectiveKelly, and the criminologist Joel Norris, who tagged him “The Sex Beast” in hisbook Serial Killers: The Growing Menace.“Whores—What to DO About Them” are five brief homicidal scenarios where womendescribed as whores are slain by a serial killer. Shooting, stabbing, andhanging are each rendered in turn. In Spring Break, Schaefer gave the killer hisown name and physical description. Schaefer completely rewrote the story,changing it from the third person in the first draft to the first person,drawing the reader closer into the mind of the psychopath as he stalks anddispatches his prey.The “Starke Stories” go beyond the crime itself into its supercharged aftermath,taking the reader inside a maximum security prison from the point of view of theconvicted killer. One story relates a grisly prison slaying that eerilyforeshadows the author’s own demise.Most of the objections to Killer Fiction voiced by the State of Florida referredto it as “pornography,” thus apparently putting the onus of their disapproval onthe sexually explicit portions of the text. However, it is more likely that thesordid prison scenes were considered offensive enough to merit suppression byCorrections.The stories Schaefer sent me at that time were really being written at me, in akind of exhibitionistic assault designed to break through my nonchalantdemeanor. In his own twisted psyche, anger, fear and revulsion were inextricablyintertwined with his sexuality, and he hoped to arouse the same complex ofsexually decadent emotions in me. More than once he suggested that what he hadwritten had “made my panties wet.” Not hardly! I could never find Schaefer’ssick psychosexual pathology sexually stimulating. But I didn’t disabuse him ofhis fantasies. I found the profound maliciousness he expressed as revealing asit was disturbing. In the privacy of my own home I was reacting emotionally witha combination of disgust and fascination. However, when I took keyboard in handto respond to him, I managed to keep a lid on it. I was seeking some insightinto the mind of a serial killer, and he was giving me the answers the only wayhe knew how.I had been handling these toxic thoughts with a certain amount of troubledequanimity for about three months when Schaefer upped the ante and sent me astory calculated to offend every possible sensibility. I hadn’t recoiled when hewould write of slicing and dicing many a woman just like me, and crow atdesecrating her corpse and her memory; I had not withdrawn when he gleefullywaxed anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, and homophobic; but I finally lost mycomposure when it came to his unabashed racism. Having served as a socialrevolutionary for some years on the civil rights front, I found myselfviscerally offended by the tirades he was sending me. Once he found out what hehad to do to provoke a reaction, he crafted his weapon. He went straight for mymost sensitive area in a story that radiates profound sexual perversion andvicious racial animosity. He called it “Nigger Jack,” and I purely hated it.When he sent me the first draft, I scribbled, “This is disgusting!” on hismanuscript, wadded it up, and sent it straight back to him.The killer auteur could not have been more thrilled:I was so pleased with your reaction to “Nigger Jack.” Honestly, I never thoughtI’d be able to gag the Media Queen! If I can make someone as jaded as yourselfsquirm with distaste and revulsion, there is yet hope for me as a horrorwriter…move over, Clive Barker! I may retire on that effort. I still think theidea of enclosing a barf bag with the book would be a boon…I’ve never beenbland, indifferent, or predictable. I always manage to generate a reaction…ofcourse, it’s not always a favorable reaction. But I do not write these storiesto degrade the reader. I’d like to strike a blow against capital punishment byshowing how it degrades all the parties involved, and thus Society as a whole.The validity of the scene goes to the basic truth of the event: Do women popwhen electrocuted? (Yes.) Now we are dealing with fact—a fact people wouldrather not be confronted with. I believe it has a greater impact on the readerto present such a matter as a visual so that a mental picture is formed of whatis being done by the representatives of the People. Who are the People? ThePeople is you, kiddo. All the college cuties out in the field hopping up anddown with Burn Ted signs never once thinking they could end up on the samegriddle, just like Andrea Hicks Jackson. To give the college cutie the benefitof the doubt, let’s say she’s acting in ignorance of what really occurs. “NiggerJack” will let her know in graphic sequence what she condones but does not see.It is a slap across the face of pro-death penalty society. Even the jaded MediaQueen is taken aback! Good. Because if it can get you upset, and in upsettingyou causes you to think, then imagine what it can do to the ladies of the Ft.Pierce Bridge Club, most of whom vote for pro-CP candidates.As I caught myself breaking my resolutely unruffled demeanor, I wondered why Ishould be so disturbed. After all, I kept telling myself, it’s only a story. ButI found these stories so palpably assaultive. Schaefer seemed to relish creatingshock waves, and the more negative the reaction, the better it gratified hismasochistic side. Physically restrained in prison, he had found a more abstractweapon to use in performing his same old sadomasochistic rituals, this timewounding the emotions if not the flesh.But I found Schaefer’s rationale compelling, and eventually I had to concede hispoint. Like Macbeth, I had “supped full with horrors,” and slaughterous thoughtsno longer startled me. But even as cynically inured to Schaefer’s homicidalideology as I had become in that short period, I found that this story actuallypulled me out of my benumbed stupor and forced me to react. And if a work of artbf any kind could so profoundly affect me, there had to be some kind of terriblesignificance to it. The visceral nature of my own reaction convinced me topublish it despite the fact that it disturbed and repelled me.The truth about his crimes did not matter to me as much as the chance to take alook into his deranged mind. Somehow I managed to overcome my revulsion to hissexually violent obsessions enough to continue documenting them. His sexism, hisracism, his fury at every living being in the world, including himself…hisboasts of rape, sodomy, murder, even necrophilia…these I managed to tolerate byreminding myself that this was important data.And so I decided to set aside my own personal distaste for the ugliness of thework, and focus on presenting it in all its twisted glory and leave it to theaudience to tell me what it was.In 1991, shortly after Loompanics published the story in their catalog, Schaeferwrote, “I had a fan letter saying ‘Nigger Jack’ was ‘a hilarious andentertaining prison insider story.’ I had never seen it as pure comedy. The fansall want more. Are they crazy or what?”PORNOGRAPHIC FILTHIn 1989, a prison guard calling Killer Fiction “pornographic filth” confiscatedit from Schaefer, claiming it was “unsuitable for a prisoner,” only returning itafter verifying with the attorney general that Schaefer’s fiction did play apart in the appeal he had before the court at the time. However, he was stillforbidden to have a copy of it.Schaefer only held a bound volume of his own book in his hands once. InSeptember of 1990, while Schaefer was temporarily housed in a less-restrictiveinstitution, two bound books were allowed in for autographs by sympatheticprison guards, one of whom admitted being a fan.Later, Schaefer’s literary ambitions absorbed another blow from the FloridaDepartment of Corrections. Starting in March of 1991, mail between him and MediaQueen was confiscated and destroyed, and he was sentenced to 30 days in the holefor “conspiracy to conduct a business.” The incriminating evidence consisted ofa letter describing the continuing adventures of Detective Dan Kelly, Rogue Cop.The disciplinary report stated, “At 9:30 a.m. on May 16, 1991…I opened a letterin front of Inmate Schaefer and discovered the envelope contained two lettersdiscussing new stories to be written and their intended characters and plot. Theletter and contents were turned over to Institutional Inspector Brian Gross andthis report was written.”Even though no money was ever paid from Media Queen to Inmate Schaefer, this didnot deter the prison from interpreting his writing as a business activity,according to their singularly curious definition. When Schaefer filed agrievance regarding the sanctions placed upon him, Gross replied:You have no authorization from the Department and/or this facility to engage inthe act of having books, texts, novels, short stories, and/or any other form ofprinted information, be it fiction or non-fiction, printed for you. Engaging ina business constitutes an agreement between parties for the exchange of realproperties, thoughts and/or ideas, or other remunerations, to includerecognition and notoriety.Although the investigator accused Media Queen of conducting a business, hemaintained that there was no such entity. And even though the superintendent’soffice had long since had copies of the corporate papers on file, they stillmanaged to conclude, “There is no Official Record of any media business orenterprise by the name of Media Queen in Atlanta, Georgia.”And so Schaefer was punished for being in the business of exchanging ideas forrecognition with an entity that did not exist! It was almost funny.BOOKS WON’T BURNBooks won’t stay banned. They won’t burn. Ideas won’t go to jail.• Alfred Whitney GriswoldThe Prison Guard Literary Guild was not the only form of censorship encounteredby Killer Fiction. De facto censorship of the marketplace determines which ideasachieve wide circulation. Conveying ideas en masse, after all, is not anart—it’s a high-ticket, high-risk business. Controversy costs money. Sympatheticprime-time footage of aggrieved and indignant right-thinking Americans attractsmore consumers than serious footage that provokes a reevaluation of comfortableassumptions. What attracts the few repels the many, and the weight of thenumbers rules. This dynamic puts the squeeze on those who publish alarming ordisturbing work, making this kind of material increasingly hard to come by.Censoring a painfully realistic work of art is like killing the wickedmessenger, or taking dope so you won’t feel the pain of your foot in the fire.That pain is information the body desperately needs so that it can yank the legout of the fire before the heart and soul are lost too. These voices are ourearly-warning system. If we can bear to listen to their pain and outrage,perhaps it will in some unforeseen way modify the choices we make as we shapeour future.Books like Killer Fiction are like vivid, disturbing dreams that convey vitalwarnings from the depths of the dreamer’s mind to higher consciousness. Just aswith our own individual nocturnal psychodramas, voices like these, that comegroaning and shrieking up from the bowels of our body politic, are telling usabout a reality that we would rather be blind than see. But the irony is thatthe homicidal violence that erupts through this kind of a mind is created bythat same willful refusal to acknowledge the darkness and chaos that we know isthere. And just as critics claim it is dangerous to release this kind ofwriting, I say it is even more dangerous to try to suppress it.The original desktop-published Killer Fiction was not what you would call abest-seller. It was a matter of what I like to call the really free press. Buteven though it was only sold through the mail in minute quantities for a shortwhile, and even though advertising ranged from scant to nonexistent, long afterit went out of print a steady stream of orders from law enforcementprofessionals and crime aficionados continued to come in from England, France,Germany, Belgium, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Poland, Australia, New Zealand,China, Hong Kong, and of course Japan.TRUE CONFESSIONSFor twenty-two years, steel bars and razor wire kept Gerard John Schaefer fromperpetrating his crimes of choice, but the psychopathic malaise that had drivenhim to those acts was still present. It was inevitably expressed in fantasies,threats, and other evidence of the never-ending struggle with the malevolentdemons within. His correspondence with me took the place of the all of theactivities he would have been enjoying in real life. The way I found out thetruth about the multicide was convoluted and difficult.During 1989 and 1990, I researched Schaefer’s story about being framed formurder. I visited him, waded through the transcripts, sifted through the boxesof evidence, and attended a hearing on his habeas corpus petition. I interviewedinvestigators, attorneys, personal friends and acquaintances, and his family,who had welcomed me into their home years ago.Schaefer was an uncommonly prolific correspondent, and for several years I wasfielding a daily deluge of lengthy letters from him. His letters weredrastically self-contradictory; often within the same letter he would presenthimself in diametrically opposed positions. His reasoning had the continuity oflogic of a trained mind but the twisted morality of a psychopath.As it was my purpose to present “The Schaefer Story,” it was necessary for me toknow what the story was. But from the very beginning, he had two stories. Thoughinviting me to advertise his fiction by calling him, as the prosecutor did, “thegreatest killer of women in this century,” at the same time he would proclaimhimself nothing more than a creative writer or a framed ex-cop. He wanted toplay both sides of the game: 4/7/89. Now, as for business, and this is for your information ONLY, as I see itthere are two ways to write the book: Should I prevail in Court, the book tellsthe tale of a cop victimized by corrupt officials. Should I ultimately lose inCourt then the book takes a different slant. I’ve not yet worked out withexactitude how it will go but my general theme would be the rendition of the 34murders known and x-number unknown. I would capitalize on my famous billinggiven freely by Mr. Stone. I would earn money, which would be my way ofinsulting the Establishment. I’d have no problem giving you “34 victims.” All that was interesting enough, up to a certain point; but although I waslearning a great deal about how his mind worked, he had revealed very little ofwhat he had actually done. After two years of having him give with one hand onlyto take away with the other, I was bored and frustrated. During a prison visitat the beginning of 1991, I confronted him.“You’re all talk,” I said, and told him that neither his fantasies of sexualviolence nor his claim of being framed were of any further interest to me, and Iwas ready to move on.He suggested that I would be making a big mistake, since I only had to waituntil his appeals were finished, and I would have “the whole story.”“Look, Schaefer,” I asked him point-blank, “are you a real serial killer ornot?”He shrugged, “Well, you know, I can’t answer that at this time. There’s adeadline. And nothing can happen until the judge rules on my appeal. But let meput it this way, you’re not wasting your time.”Over the next three months, in an apparent effort to prove that he was worthy ofmy continued attention, he revealed in both personal interviews andcorrespondence the genuinely pernicious entity hiding behind the roly-polyplay-killer mask.Layer upon layer of his carefully-cultivated mystique fell away, and finally hisall-too-real skeletons began to emerge from the shadows. “Suppose I told youthat [Killer Fiction/Beyond Killer Fiction] is all TRUE,” he suggested,proposing to “back it up with burial pits…the metal rings where whores werehanged alive in the swamp.” Though he started off somewhat tentatively, he wenton to put much more incriminating remarks in writing.In classic psychopathic style, he even tried to blame me for the murders he hadcommitted. “I will tell you here and now that plenty of young women died becauseyou couldn’t help me resolve my various crisises in 1965. I tried to tell youabout it but you couldn’t deal with it. You bolted, abandoned me; that’s when itstarted.” Threatening me to keep his revelations secret, he admitted that he wasconcerned about “what you will think and do when you find out that what youcurrently believe to be KBS [killer bullshit] is not…you cannot conceive thatwhat I’ve told you can be true. I’ve committed horrors beyond your ability tocomprehend.”Secretly abandoning the ersatz claim to innocence he had been publicly toutingfor years, he now claimed that prosecutor Robert Stone had been correct todesignate him our nation’s number one serial killer, but Schaefer went on toassert that he actually deserved more credit than he had been given. “As youknow I’ve always harped on Stone’s list of 34. In 1973 I sat down and drew up alist of my own. As I recall, my list was just over 80. I wasn’t exactly takingnames…I was very careful never to leave a pattern. I killed women in all waysfrom shooting, strangling, stabbing, beheading to odd ways such as drowning,smothering and crucifixion. One I whipped to death with a strap, another I beatto jelly with a baseball bat while she was hanging by her wrists.”When I questioned the figure he volunteered, he explained, “I cannot even giveyou an exact figure, but I’d say between 80-110.” It was hard to remember themall, because there were ontological considerations, such as whether to countvictims who were not intentionally murdered, such as unborn fetuses and girlswho had merely choked on their gags while awaiting a proper execution.For the most part, he avoided giving names, dates or places, confining hisobservations to generalities, such as, “Each one died differently. Some wereacquiescent; a few kicked up a fuss, but they all died.” He summed it all upsmugly, “I enjoyed each and every experience.”I was visiting Schaefer at Florida State Prison while he was sending me thesestartling confessions, and I had a chance to talk candidly with him about them.In one visit, I confronted him. His story didn’t add up; there were too manyinconsistencies. He leaned forward, bringing his face close to mine, and gazingintently into my eyes, he spoke in a low voice, pausing for emphasis, “You don’tunderstand…because you’re not…a serial killer. What I tell you…isinconsistent…because the experience itself…is inconsistent.”image [Images/40.jpg]I thought about that for a moment and finally shrugged. “You’re right. I don’tunderstand. You’ve got to explain it.”He leaned back, sighed, sipped his coffee. Groping for words and finding them byfits and starts, he finally came up with an analogy. “It’s like…I’m throwingrocks at your window…and you’re trying to figure out where the rocks are comingfrom…and you can’t…because they’re all different colors. But you see…they’redifferent colors…because they’re all coming…from different places.”“Ah! I see.” For some reason, that imagery made perfect sense to me, as itelucidates the striking inconsistencies in the serial killer’s psyche. Thediscrete and rigid contrasting elements symbolize the fragmentation of thepersonality into an uneasy amalgam of diverse components. With this type ofpersonality, every truth conceals its equal and opposite, just as a perky smilemasks a simmering anger—except when the mask slips, and the madness flares.Once I complained that while I had faithfully created the impression that he wasmerely a creative writer, he had sent a handwritten note to an editor at USAToday, claiming he had committed over two dozen murders. “Why are you sayingthese things, John?” I wanted to know. “When you’ve got me telling people you’reinnocent, why are going around behind my back and telling them you are guilty?”He drew close to me and with his voice lowered, hissed, “I want to be sure youunderstand this.” He gripped my arm. “I’m saying these things because they’reTRUE.” I just sat there in silence staring into his eyes, letting it soak inuntil finally I looked away. “OK, John. I believe you.” I will never forget themessage in those piercing violet eyes as they burned into mine through theblack-framed magnifying lenses. That LOOK! It was unmistakable.As I drove home afterwards, all the way I mused over the way his gaze sounwaveringly affirmed his guilt. When I wrote to him commenting on what I hadseen in his eyes, he replied, “I have given you a very brief glimpse ofsomething that no woman alive today has ever seen. You understood the messageviscerally.You were able to snap down on a message that should erase any doubt you ever hadabout whether or not I am for real. I was able to communicate an absolute truthto you with a single look…You now know one secret…You have access to the realthing!”He went on to remind me of less fortunate women who had recognized the grimreaper in his eyes. “Consider the nameless, pricey prostitute who is handcuffed,her ankles tied and after much time she says, dreading the answer, ‘Are yougoing to kill me?’ She is answered with the eyes. She sees the eyes, thewhetstone, the razor sharp skinning blade. How does she handle that reality!Badly, of course. Like a cow in a slaughter chute.”I finally begged off. “Enough already,” I wrote him. “I believe you.”KILLER FACTAlthough he had set out to convince me that he really was a serial killer, onceSchaefer persuaded me, apparently he expected our enterprise to keep rollingmerrily along as it had before. But I no longer had too much to say about hisclaims of innocence.These confessions were delivered along with threats as to what he would do, orhave done, if I were to reveal them. He threatened to call on his allegedconnections within biker gangs, white supremacists, satanists, and the so-calledDixie Mafia to have me abducted, raped, and even murdered. He was frustratedwhen these gorilla tactics did not intimidate me into helping him maintain hiscreative writing alibi.When Schaefer began to enjoin my child in his threats, I shut him down for good.I had the prison forbid him to write to me any more. Then he mounted apropaganda campaign, releasing statements through various outlets heestablished, claiming that he had been irreparably harmed not only by myself,but by every other writer who dared to even imply that he was exactly what heappeared to be: a serial killer trying to get away with murder.He filed three lawsuits against me. When he attempted to set one of his libellawsuits for hearing in Alachua County, I responded by filing a Motion forSecurity and as Exhibit A, attached 500 pages of his handwritten threats andconfessions. After perusing this singularly persuasive document, the Courtsummarily dismissed Schaefer’s claim and sealed the record.This same Exhibit A also appeared in affidavits that I made available to twoseparate authors defending themselves against the serial litigator’s claim thatthey had libeled him by tagging him a serial killer. The results were unanimous.In Schaefer v. Michael Newton the court ruled that Schaefer is “a serial killerundoubtedly linked to numerous murders” and in Schaefer v. Colin Wilson Schaeferwas declared “libel-proof under the law.”The three lawsuits Schaefer filed against me were dismissed, and his attempts tohave criminal charges brought against me similarly failed.Through Killer Fiction he reveals only one portion of his multiple reality. Theman was as complex and contradictory as a revolving series of funhouse mirrors.It is the kind of fractured behavior that can only issue from someone who istruly capable of committing such depraved acts. Just as one aspect of thispernicious entity is revealed, it is replaced by its opposite. Only a personcapable of cultivating a legitimate role in society while simultaneouslyindulging in a secret life of violence and perversion can convey suchcontradictory images of himself. The capacity for encompassing diametricallyopposed self-images is essential to nurturing a secret life of predation whilefunctioning within society for long enough to get away with murder more than acouple of times.The confusion Schaefer created issued from the qualities that made the man whathe was. A term like “serial killer” is only useful to describe one aspect of hisbehavior. It is less helpful in coming to terms with the essential disorder thatdistinguishes his psyche. Words like “psychopathic” and “sadomasochistic” and“antisocial” and even “multiple personality” have been used to describeindividuals like Gerard John Schaefer, but while they may be accurate in aclinical sense, they are somewhat lacking in conveying their most irreduciblyintrinsic trait.I believe M. Scott Peck captures it best in his excellent book People of theLie:People in prison can almost always be assigned a standard psychiatric diagnosisof one kind or another, corresponding in layman’s terms to such qualities ascraziness or impulsiveness or aggressiveness or lack of conscience. But the evilhave no such obvious defects, and do not fall clearly into our routinepsychiatric pigeonholes. This is not because they are healthy. It is simplybecause we have not yet developed a definition for their disease.How is it that psychiatrists have until now failed to recognize such a distinct,rigid type? It is because they have bought the pretense of respectability. Theyhave been deceived by what Harvey M. Cleckley called ‘the mask of sanity.’ Evilis ‘the ultimate disease.’ Despite their pretense of sanity, the evil are themost insane at all.When confronted by evil, the wisest and most secure adult will usuallyexperience confusion. We literally feel overwhelmed by the labyrinthine mass oflies and twisted motives and distorted communication into which we will be drawnif we attempt to work with evil people.Describing an encounter with an evil person, one woman wrote, ’it was as if I’dsuddenly lost my ability to think.’ Once again, this reaction is quiteappropriate. Lies confuse.The evil are ‘the people of the lie,’ deceiving others as they also build layerupon layer of self-deception. Forever fleeing the light of self-exposure and thevoice of their own conscience, they are the most frightened of human beings.They live their lives in sheer terror. They need not be consigned to any hell;they are already in it.ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE FLAMESTo enter chez Schaefer was to wander through the Byzantine lair of a terminalmalignancy in human form. Because of his strong need to deceive himself, hisperception of reality was profoundly distorted.Imagine the image he must have had of the woman he had fantasized about forseventeen solitary years…who suddenly materialized one day like a tantalizingrainbow-colored vision, lifting him out of the gloom of his dungeon, and takinghim on a dizzying dance with the notoriety he both craved and deplored…the womanwho finally turned her back on him and fled, elusive as a black cat, vanishinginto the night without so much as a farewell flick of her tail.Before Schaefer’s wounded heart could heal, he was dealt a most unkindly cut.When the Supreme Court finally rejected his appeal, he had lost his favoriteconfidante. He languished forgotten and forlorn in his lonely cell, watching heron national TV being serenaded in court by the rugged young serial killer whoseface had been in the news lately. It was enough to make any red-blooded Americanpredator feel like a washed-up old prom queen.Schaefer’s 1993 Valentine was right in character:image [Images/44.jpg]Nor was Schaefer far from Danny Rolling’s thoughts:I had the most unpleasant luck of running into Schaefer the other day.Clink…clink…rattle…rattle… I was doing the chain-shackle-shuffle down the longhall escorted by Sergeant S0-&-S0…when lo & behold…there he was standing in linewaiting to file into his wing. He flashed that sickening smile of his at me andlifted a folder containing some of his recent achievements, waving them at melike we were old pals or something. Clink... clink... rattle…rattle… strugglingalong. I just stared bloody daggers through him and let the hatred show.This guy has got real problems, doesn’t he? Schaefer is a little too full ofhimself and we can easily figure out the content of substance he is filled with.It smells like something pooling in a sewage treatment plant. I can understandwhy you got physically ill reading Schaefer’s twisted and delusioned writings.The sample you sent me left a real bitter taste in my mouth.I wouldn’t worry about that wimp if I was you. He is just a spooky little punkwho gets his kicks out of intimidating people. He’s a bluffer. He wants anyonewho has the displeasure of entertaining him to believe he holds a full house,but if you call his bluff, you’ll find he only has a pair of deuces—two pitifulexcuses for being barely human.He boasts he is ‘The Greatest Killer of Women This Century.’ How could anyoneblatantly brag about such a thing? All the suffering and pain he claims to beresponsible for…and he actually gloats? ‘I loved killing whores.’ What an awfulself-professed statement!But more unkindly cuts were in store for Schaefer. On November 11, 1994, hefiled this pitiful pleading with a Florida court that had already dismissed hislatest lawsuit against me:While working in the prison law library Plaintiff was attacked by another inmateand stabbed repeatedly in and about the face, body and hands. Due to the traumasustained incidental to this attack, Plaintiff is now unable to prosecute hisappeal; therefore Plaintiff withdraws the appeal in this case.I was so moved I almost sent the poor guy a sympathy card. A few days later,Danny Rolling reported from Death Row:Schaefer is having big time problems. He is on everyone’s shit list here at FSP,and I mean literally. This past week, he has had shit and piss thrown at him—hegot one hell of an ass-whooping—and to top it off, his cell was set on fireTWICE. Everything he owned got burned up, and what wasn’t, got ruined by oil andwater spewn from the sprinkler system.I have recently learned a great deal about Schaefer from solid cons who knowwhat a RAT and PAIN FREAK he is. Also, he is a manipulating SNITCH, and has beenfor a long time.Just thought you’d like to know the ole asshole is having a rough go of it. Butthen again, Schaefer might be enjoying himself.I mean, masochists enjoy drinking piss, eating shit, and getting their asseskicked. Don’t they?The situation apparently had its origins a few years back when the legal beaglewas helping an inmate fight a murder charge. Soon after he got the killer totell him the location of the body, that highly sensitive confidentialinformation wound up in the hands of the prosecution, who used it to moveSchaefer’s client from population to Death Row.So now Schaefer had offered to help another killer with his appeals. This timethe prisoner told Schaefer that he had already contracted with a team ofjailhouse lawyers. So when Schaefer offered to do the job for free, it did notsit too well with the two displaced lawyers, who happened to be pretty toughcharacters in their own right. Considered stand-up cons, they made sure the wordwent out about Schaefer’s past and present betrayals of the prisoners he hadpretended to help. So when the brutal barristers filed their objections to theinterloper’s pleadings with their shivs, the power of criminal justice was onceagain affirmed as they received the unanimous moral support of the entire prisonpopulation, a rare solidarity traditionally celebrated with excremental salutesand bonfires.“Yep, Schaefer’s running scared now, looking over his shoulder,” observed oneprison insider. “He’s one step ahead of the flames.”KING AND BRONSONHomicide Detective Jack King holds a Master’s degree in Criminal Justice. He hasbeen a police officer since 1970, and he has been with Ft. Lauderdale PoliceDepartment since 1978, with the past five years spent investigating homicides.In an interview on October 16, 1996, Homicide Chief Tim Bronson called King“without a doubt the best detective this department has seen in a long time.”Shortly after Tim Bronson took over as Homicide Chief of the detective bureau inthe fall of 1995, he assigned Jack King to go back through some of their oldmissing persons files and see if he could close them, with particular attentionto cases that might be linked to Schaefer.“Our investigation consisted of trying to match missing persons to that timeperiod,” said King. “We didn’t have a whole lot of information. In most cases,we didn’t even have a body to do anything with.”“An additional problem we had is the time factor,” said Bronson, “both theperiod of time being twenty-some years ago, and that we were doing this kind ofin between our other duties.”image [Images/46.jpg]After compiling a few tantalizing leads, they decided to interview the serialkiller who had grown up in their jurisdiction. If the Broward state attorneywould agree to file charges on one of the cases, they could use the others asbargaining chips to get Schaefer to admit to them all.“We called to make arrangements on a Friday, to see if we could get access tohim,” said King, “and then Monday somebody from the prison called me back, andsaid, ‘Don’t bother. He’s been the victim of a homicide.’”“You can’t believe how frustrating that was,” said Bronson. “Our hope was thatthis guy would be driving us around showing us where the bodies were.”Before working homicide, King investigated sex crimes, and regrets he missed theopportunity to learn more about the bizarre psychosexual aspects of Schaefer’smake-up from a personal interview.“If you look strictly at his writings, you would think that there was a sexualaspect,” he observed. “But if you look at the crimes that he was convicted of,the indication there would be one strictly of power, or being smarter than thepursuers. It would appear that he was playing some sort of game to see what hecould get away with. Criminality is not usually an aspect of a police officer.Control, yes. If you look at the personality of police officers, there are somecontrolling aspects of our personalities. But not crime.”BELINDA HUTCHENSThe week after Schaefer was killed, an article ran in the Ft. LauderdaleSun-Sentinel on the ongoing investigation into Schaefer’s old cases, naming thethree missing women: Leigh Hainline Bonadies, Carmen Marie (Candy) Hallock, andBelinda Hutchens.“I contacted some of the Hutchens family members,” said King. “I located asister and a brother, and they told me the husband had a drug problem and spentmost of his time in prison. I found him working at a used car lot on FederalHighway.“He couldn’t remember a lot of details, but when he spoke of his ex-wife, hebegan crying, and he told me it still affects him to this day.“The way he explained it, even though they were married and they lived together,she had her own lifestyle and was kind of independent of him. She did what shewanted to do.”Apparently, that would include dating other men.According to the original police reports, William Hutchens had reported histwenty-two-year-old wife Belinda missing on January 5, 1972, six months beforeSchaefer was arrested. Hutchens told police how he and his two-year-old daughterwatched his wife get into a car with a stranger and ride away, never to be heardfrom again. Not even her remains have been recovered.On April 28, 1973, after Schaefer was charged with murder, Detective Tom Brophywith the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department picked up William Hutchens and tookhim to look at Schaefer’s blue Datsun to see if Hutchens would recognize it.“That’s the car,” said Hutchens immediately. Asked how he could be so sure, hepointed out the low parking lights on the front of the vehicle, and exhibitingthe sharp eye for detail that could only belong to a used car salesman, he notedthe placement of the rear license plate in the center of the trunk with no breakin the rear bumper, and pointed out the vents in the rear window, instructingDetective Brophy that this Datsun was the only model with vents.On Tuesday, May 8, 1973, after Schaefer was charged with murder, Ft. LauderdalePolice received a call from the Chief of Police Detectives in Martin County,Chief Thompson, who said they found a little black book in Schaefer’s property,listing William Hutchens’ name and telephone number.However, further leads failed to materialize. Without a body, and withoutsufficient evidence to tie Schaefer or anyone else to the disappearance, nocharges were ever brought.After the story naming Belinda Hutchens ran in the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel,apparently William Hutchens was contacted by the daughter he had not seen formany, many years, although their emotional reunion was fated to be short-lived.After the inevitable falling-out, the daughter’s lifestyle as a part-time dancerand model drew her back into the shadows of the same fatal demimonde that hadclaimed her mother almost a quarter century ago.CARMEN HALLOCKThe missing persons report on Carmen Hallock identified her as “good looking”and noted under personal habits that the 22-year-old waitress and junior collegestudent “drinks a lot and frequents bars.”She was first reported missing by her former sister-in-law, Nancy Bauer, whotold police she had maintained a close friendship with Carmen even though shehad long since divorced Carmen’s brother.She last saw her on December 18, 1969, over lunch at Britt’s in the Coral RidgeShopping Center. She told police about their last conversation, in which Carmentold her of an appointment she had made for 5:00 p.m. that same day about amysterious job. There was a guy who was a teacher at the junior college, shesaid, who told her he did some kind of undercover work for the government.Schaefer had gone to work as an intern teacher on February 27, 1969.image [Images/48.jpg]Carmen said this man would go over to the islands on weekends and would comeback with “lots of money.” She had spoken to him about the job several nightsbefore, and was to meet him again that evening. She told Nancy that inconnection with this new job, she would be set up in an apartment in Washington,D.C. or New York City and all her bills would be paid.After they finished lunch, Carmen and Nancy did some shopping. Carmen bought apair of black patent-leather pumps, telling Nancy she was going to wear themwith her black cocktail dress that night when she went to meet the unnamedstranger who seemed to offer more than a free lunch.Nancy kissed Carmen goodbye at 2:30 p.m. and never saw her again.She was last seen at the Brave Bull on North Federal Highway, by a bartender sheknew, who had gone there for dinner and was just leaving when she came in. Thebartender, referred to in police reports only as “Les,” had often seen thepretty girl he knew as Candy when she came in for drinks at Stumpy’s, on Federalat 18th Street. Les reported that the vivacious brunette was wearing a blackdress and black shoes, and that she looked happy.By Christmas Day, Nancy Bauer had not heard from Carmen. Something had to bewrong. Carmen had not shown up at work as expected on December 19th and had notvisited her family. She had never gone away like that before. Letting herselfinto Carmen’s apartment with a spare key, Nancy found Carmen’s small puppy, whohad obviously been neglected for several days.Looking through her belongings, she determined that Carmen’s car keys, driver’slicense, and motor vehicle registration were missing. All of her clothing seemedto be intact—with the notable exception of the black shoes Carmen had bought forher mysterious rendezvous. No black dress was to be found.Nor was any trace of the missing girl, until April of 1973, when Broward CountySheriff’s Office found two gold teeth among Schaefer’s belongings that ForensicDentist Richard Souviron identified as the only known remains of Carmen Hallock.After the positive identification of the gold teeth was made, Carmen’shalf-sister Martha Bormann flew down with her husband to inspect the jewelryfound among Schaefer’s belongings, to see if she could identify any of thepieces as belonging to Carmen.Mrs. Bormann immediately picked up a round gold dime-sized pin, with a greenfour-leaf clover and two stars, and said, “This is mine.”When she was a little girl, she was in the Girl Scouts in Brooklyn, New York,and had earned this pin for better world relations. She said she believed theGirl Scouts gave out badges later, but back in the early fifties, they gave outpins.The pin had been kept by her mother, Mrs. Eva Hallock, until she passed away inMay of 1969, and had then been passed on to Carmen.After Mrs. Bormann completed a sworn statement identifying this and severalother pieces of jewelry, her husband Henry told investigators that as soon as heentered the property room, he noticed the Girl Scout pin, but he didn’t sayanything, as he wanted his wife to pick it out for herself.With this case, police came one step closer to connecting the notorious serialkiller with a Ft. Lauderdale woman who disappeared under suspiciouscircumstances, but without a corpse, they still fell short of giving the state’sattorney enough evidence to charge him with murder.In one of Schaefer’s fantasies, he writes, “She sat there in a black chiffondress with her hair done up and black pantyhose and high heels. She was wearingperfume and was very sexy.” Schaefer claims these words were written in 1967,two years before Carmen Hallock disappeared, dressed to kill in exactly the kindof outfit Schaefer would have asked her to wear for her appointment with themysterious stranger.LEIGH HAINLINE BONADIESOn September 8, 1969, Chuck Bonadies was locked out of the apartment he sharedwith his bride. They had only been married one month, and had not gotten aroundto making two sets of keys. He found a note on the apartment door from sayingshe was going to Miami. He waited for her to return and let him in the house,but Leigh was never heard from again.As Chuck struggled to understand what might have happened to his bride, herecalled a suspicious story she had recently told him about an old friend ofhers, who had lived three doors down from her, who had been trying to get her togo to work for the C.I.A. She said he had mentioned sums of money ranging from$5,000 to $20,000 for her to travel out to South America, and that she would beable to collect additional sums in the foreign country. Chuck had told her toforget the whole thing.image [Images/50.jpg]Leigh’s uncle hired William C. Marshall, a private investigator from Miami, toinvestigate Leigh’s disappearance, but family cash reserves ran dry before hewas able to turn up anything significant. Marshall did, however, determine thatLeigh had recently been playing tennis with one Gerard John Schaefer, who wasemployed at Plantation High as an intern teacher.Marshall reported that school board records listed Schaefer’s address as 2716 SW34th Avenue. Indeed, the Hainlines had lived two doors down from the Schaefersat 2700 SW 34th Avenue throughout the early youth and high school years of John,Leigh, and the other children.Leigh’s brother Gary had known Schaefer since they were both in junior high.Although they were not close friends, Gary recalled going on many hunting andfishing trips with John, and recalled as well the numerous occasions when thebattles between Schaefer and his father could be heard throughout the wholeneighborhood.Gary told police he was surprised to see Schaefer described in the news as an“easy-going non-drinking type.” On the contrary, Gary said, he had always foundJohn quite quick-tempered. He told police Schaefer “always did his share ofdrinking and carousing.”Janice Crosley recalled seeing Leigh on the tennis court the day before shedisappeared. Janice recalled that Leigh had mentioned the name John Schaefer.Although she could not recall exactly what was said, the gist of it was thatSchaefer was supposed to take Leigh to the airport.In 1970, one year after Leigh disappeared, Gary called John and asked aboutLeigh. John told Gary that Leigh had called him and asked him to drive her tothe airport, that she wanted to fly to Cincinnati. He said he agreed to give hera ride, but she never got back with him.One can only wonder if Schaefer was writing about Leigh Hainline when he wrotethese words:I have been tempted to do away with other women too, usually ones that I amsexually attracted to but do not know personally. One girl whom I almost killedI later became good friends with and drove her to the airport to fly up north.It was an experiment to see if I still wanted to kill her after I got to knowher, and I didn’t. In fact, I am still rather fond of her.When Schaefer was arrested for murder in 1973, the search of his belongingsstored at his mother’s home at 2716 SW 34th Avenue turned up several pieces ofLeigh’s jewelry. There was a locket inscribed “Leigh” and a Stranahan Pep Clubpin, and Gary Hainline identified a small jade cross that his sister had kept ina jewelry box.The jewelry and teeth were found in the same search that produced the writingsin question, which Schaefer later claimed were written around 1967 and leftbehind with other nonessential belongings when he left his mother’s home to moveout on his own.Most law enforcement professionals who have studied this case consider thesewritings to represent a sort of diary, as accounts of actual crimes writtenafter the fact. Some of them might be. However, it is equally plausible thatwith Schaefer, as with Ted Bundy, the fantasy preceded the act, and writingthese stories was a way of building the clarity and intensity of his impulses tothe point where he felt compelled to act them out in real life—the type ofactivity he actually called “feeding the sickness.” Either way, whether writtenbefore or after the fact, the writing of them and the subsequent reading of themwould serve to reinforce what started out as fantasies and over the years,finally went on to become intermingled with memories.“A disturbed personality is always going to find something to lash along itsmadness,” he wrote.If Schaefer was elaborating a fantasy in his earlier writings, in later years heseems to have enacted his homicidal scenarios with at least several knownvictims.An escalation in complexity of his modus operandi is noted. With these crimes,Schaefer seemed to be setting new challenges for himself. If he started out, ashe says, perfecting an M.O. targeting throwaways as the easiest victims, by 1969his technique seems to have evolved to the point where it gave him an excitingnew thrill to pluck a woman out of her social milieu in a sophisticated way thatprovided a prepackaged excuse for her absence. Someone definitely staged thesedisappearances so the victims would provide their own false leads in advance. Itwould seem quite an extraordinary coincidence for this convicted killer to havethe teeth and jewelry of women known to have some connection to him, had he notbeen their worst nightmare—an attractive, friendly guy who also happened to betheir killer.image [Images/52.jpg]JACK DOLANCandy Hallock’s two gold-filled teeth were found in a drawer of the same old,battered desk that had been in John Schaefer’s bedroom since the Schaefers movedto Florida.Just as Schaefer blithely explained away Leigh Hainline’s jewelry by claimingshe had let him hold it as collateral on a loan, he was not without a readyexplanation for Hallock’s teeth. They must have been left in that desk by JackDolan.As he explained to his defense attorney Elton Schwarz, and later reiterated inseveral letters to me, he had moved some of his furniture to a house in OsceolaVillage off State Road 84 to set up housekeeping with his first wife, Marty, ahighly intellectual young woman who was seeing a psychiatrist at the HendersonClinic regularly, as was John.Not long after they moved in together, Marty got a divorce and left the area.Shortly after that, a guy he knew from high school named John or Jack Dolanmoved in for about three weeks. According to Schaefer, Dolan told him he hadkilled both Hallock and Hainline, and he must have put Hallock’s teeth in thedesk before it was brought back to Schaefer’s mother’s home.In the course of trying to persuade me of this theory, Schaefer sent writtenauthorization to Elton Schwarz allowing him to release to me the audiotape ofthe sealed deposition he had taken from Dolan on the Fourth of July in 1973 infront of Dolan’s dorm at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton.It is typical of Schaefer that he would be able to maintain the illusion thatlistening this tape would tend to exonerate him and shift my suspicions onto theguy his sister Sadie had given the nickname “Dippy Dolan.” On the contrary, itthrew a whole new sinister light on Schaefer while revealing Dolan to be aninnocent bystander.Dolan had met Schaefer when they attended St. Thomas Aquinas High Schooltogether. When Schwarz asked if they were friends, Dolan hedged, “We did doubledate, but I had closer friends.” Dolan went on to attend Broward CommunityCollege and then spent from 1965 to 1968 in the Navy, serving a full term ofduty in Vietnam.After returning home to Ft. Lauderdale he worked for a few months, and then wentback to Broward Community College, where he earned an AA degree in 1970. Hestudied government at Florida State University in Tallahassee for two quarters,then returned to Ft. Lauderdale and worked for Sears for a year. It was duringthat period, while Schaefer was working as an intern teacher, that they sharedthe house in Osceola Village, off State Road 84.“Man, that was the worst place I ever lived in my whole life,” Dolan toldSchwarz. “The ceiling went like this, the floor went like that, and the plumbingdidn’t work sometimes. It was really old. And his dog was drooling all over theplace. It smelled like a kennel, and man, it was just bad. I couldn’t wait toget out of there. I was completely disgusted, and a little bit scared. John wasjust getting a little bit weird.”It was right after John had come back from Europe, and after showing Dolan theusual tourist snapshots, he added rather slyly, “I’ve got some other picturestoo,” but when Dolan asked about them, Schaefer just laughed and demurred, “Youdon’t want to see those pictures.”According to Dolan, he never saw the questionable pictures, nor did he see the175 to 200 “nudist” magazines that Schaefer had apparently mutilated, drawingnooses around women’s necks and stabbing at them, leaving holes in the paper.Though listed as being submitted into evidence in Schaefer’s murder trial, allof these items have “disappeared,” along with the original manuscripts, exceptfor “Murder Plan,” which was read to the jury, and the first few pages of astory set in Germany. Most likely these have been stolen from the evidencelocker in Ft. Pierce by collectors of such murderabilia.image [Images/54.jpg]Dolan did, however, note an unusually large number of skinning knives around thehouse, and observed that Schaefer always had knives, guns, machetes and axes inthe back of his Volkswagen.“He liked to kill,” Dolan remembered. “That’s what he told me. And he said hedrank blood. He was laughing, he got a big joke out of it. I was trying to thinkif it in relation to something like a hunter, where they would put blood ontheir forehead or some shit like that, and kind of get carried away orsomething, but I don’t know anything about hunting. It was all just pretty farout for me. He’d get in these moods, he’d be talking all this shit, and he’djust get real weird.”Dolan described one night when Schaefer was dating a slender girl with reddishhair and planned on spending some private time with her. “He didn’t want mearound,” recalled Dolan, so he spent the night at a friend’s. The next day whenhe came back to the house, Schaefer seemed nervous, and “made this big thingabout telling me that they had had intercourse, but she had been menstruating,so there was blood all over the place.” Dolan told Schaefer he didn’t notice anyblood, and Schaefer said he had cleaned it up. Dolan never saw the girl again,nor were investigators able to locate her later. When Dolan asked Schaefer aboutthe girl, he brushed it aside, saying, “Oh, just go over to her house now.”Dolan recalled Schaefer pointing out Leigh Hainline to him, and telling him howLeigh would undress in front of her bedroom window while Schaefer would watch.Schaefer said she was “really sharp,” recalled Dolan. Though she was only twoyears older, Schaefer thought of her as much older than him. “He kind of heldher off,” Dolan said. “He really liked her.” Dolan himself never knew Leigh thatwell, “just to say hi.” She worked at the Village Inn, “and if she waited on mytable, I’d just give her my order, that’s all.”Dolan had known Carmen Hallock much better. He dated her for two or three weekswhen he was going to Broward Community College right after he got out of theservice. “She used to hang around the Veteran’s Club Table, and that’s where Imet her.” During that period, Dolan recalled that Schaefer was attending schoolat Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, and had no contact with him. “Iwas living at home, and I had not seen John in quite a while.”Dolan had a sexual relationship with Hallock, and then she told him she had metanother guy, a sailor, and even though they never had a falling-out, they wenttheir separate ways.“I had always been saying in the back of my mind, you know, I ought to go backand see old Candy again. But I never did. And then John showed me the articleand said she was gone.”“What I’m trying to get at, Jack,” said Schwarz, “I’m trying to figure out whyJohn would even consider making these statements about the fact that you mayknow something about her disappearance.”“John says that about me?”“Yes.”“I have not talked to John in two years. And I’m not into killing anybody.”“You never recall him making any mention of Carmen Hallock being chopped up anddisposed of at the city dump?”“Jesus, no.”“You never made any such statement to John?”“What was my statement supposed to be?”“That she had been chopped up and disposed of at the city dump.”His voice rising incredulously, Dolan asked, “I said that to John?” then addedfirmly, “No. No way.” Under his breath he muttered, “oh, wow,” and thenaddressed Schwarz. “This is turning into kind of a bummer. Here I am sittinghere telling you my goddamn life story, and I don’t know you from Adam, right?And you—you—Jesus Christ…”“Look, Jack, I’ve got the job of trying to defend John, and trying to do what’sright for him. And all I can do is try to find out anything I can. I’m nottrying to implicate anybody. I didn’t even have to tell you that. This is not aneasy job, and I sure don’t appreciate having to work on the Fourth of July.Matter of fact, I’ve been putting eighteen to twenty hours a day for three solidweeks, just trying to find out what may have happened. Other than John, nobodyhas tied you in with anybody. And I’m not trying to at this time. I’m justtrying to figure out why John would have made this statement.”“The only think I can think of is maybe some kind of guilt transfer.”“Jack, the doctors who have been examining John agree that he is sick. Obviouslyif he did these things, he is very sick. I think he belongs in a mentalhospital, not in a jail.”“If he did, I don’t see how he could ever be rehabilitated enough to let himout.”THE REAL DETECTIVE KELLYIn 1972, the same year Gerard Schaefer ended his career in law enforcement,David Kelly began his. He went to work for the North Miami Beach PoliceDepartment, becoming a detective in 1975.It was the summer of 1986 when he was handed his introduction to Schaefer, inthe form of a small envelope from Florida State Prison containing a brief,handwritten letter addressed to the Chief of Police, alleging that there werethree individuals in their jurisdiction who were involved in the kiddie porntrade. Chief Terell Sheffield asked Detective Kelly to follow up on it. Thusbegan a mutual fascination between killer and cop that eventually led to thedevelopment of Schaefer’s fictional “rogue cop” person a known as Detective DanKelly.image [Images/56.jpg]Both were born in 1947 and raised as Catholics in South Florida, and the blonde,blue-eyed Kelly became a mirror, or an alter ego for Schaefer. “He wasvicariously living through me. I was the image he wanted to portray forhimself,” says Kelly, “and I took advantage of that. I fed his ego about hisintelligence, his knowledge; I stroked him, no question. But he stroked me too.It was a two-way street.” Kelly hoped to close some of the old cases that wereSchaefer’s grim legacy. “In my writings back and forth with Schaefer, there wasa great deal of conversation about the crimes he was convicted of. I had gottena copy of his diary, I had talked to the FBI and the Florida Department of LawEnforcement, I talked to a number of people who had dealt with Schaefer over theyears, and most warned me to just stay away from him. But I felt, egotistically,that perhaps I could get some information out of him that other people had beenunable to get.”PRISON VISITFormer North Miami Beach Detective David Kelly described his only visit withGerard John Schaefer at Florida State Prison as “extremely spooky,” and admittedto being severely disconcerted by the experience. He was escorted through aseries of barred gates into an interview room and given a seat on one side of adouble sheet of bulletproof glass. After he was seated, Schaefer was broughtinto the room on the other side of the glass.“First off, he was huge, which kind of surprised me. He had the weight that youput on in prison from the high-carbohydrate diet. And he was intimidating. Hewas handcuffed in the front. He held his hands up, thrusting them at me, and thefirst words he said to me were, They’re afraid I’m going to kill you.’ And hesmiled. I tell you what, I nearly peed my pants! After that, I was a basketcase. I just let him talk. I didn’t even ask him the questions I had wanted toask.”DEE DEE KELLYThe relationship between Schaefer and Kelly developed from that initial inquiryinto a kiddie porn sting operation involving Schaefer penning suggestive lettersin a loopy, feminine hand, signed “Dee Dee Kelly,” whom he portrayed as a14-year-old girl who liked to pose for nude photos. The return address on theletters was for a post office box manned by the Postal Inspector, who would thenturn over the letters responding to Schaefer’s provocative letters to the NorthMiami Beach Police Department.image [Images/57.jpg]Schaefer asked Kelly to write to the prison authorizing his correspondence to begiven privileged confidential status, as it was concerning police business.Kelly complied with Schaefer’s wishes, only to be contacted several weeks laterby irate prison authorities. Schaefer had been invoking Kelly’s name to carrygive confidential status to his correspondence with numerous individualsinvolved in child pornography. When reprimanded by prison investigators, haddefended himself by appealing to his privileged status as an informant forDetective Kelly.“He was sending a certain percentage of the mail he wanted to go out through meto come back to this Postal Service address, but then he was also sending outadditional letters,” Kelly speculates, “probably with a return address ofsomeone he knew, most likely a female in Tampa, who supposedly had been bustedfor child pornography previously.”Kelly reminded the prison investigator of the letter he had filed which onlyendorsed Schaefer’s correspondence with himself and had never been intended toenable Schaefer’s unfettered abuse of the privileged status with his shadycorrespondence. “He was trying place himself in a situation where he would haveeasier and less scrutinized access to mail,” says Kelly.Although considerable volume of correspondence was generated by this operation,for the first eight months no perpetrators were identified. Then Schaefer sentKelly a pen-pal newsletter, and an ad offering “exotic photos” for five dollarscaught his eye. It listed an address in the Philippines, under the fictitiousname of “Fila Galom.”The Filipino connection piqued Kelly’s interest because of the case of MervynEric Cross, who had been convicted of conducting a kiddie porn scam whileincarcerated with Schaefer. Investigation revealed that Cross had been puttingthrough calls to Schaefer’s father, Gerard John Schaefer, Senior, who would thenallow his telephone line to be used for a primitive form of three-way callinginvolving a Filipino partner.Kelly sent off for the photos, mentioning Schaefer’s name as a reference, andwas surprised to receive a roll of undeveloped film, which upon processingshowed explicitly pornographic photos of small brown girls. With this, theinvestigation was turned over to U.S. Customs.About two weeks later, Kelly heard from a furious Schaefer. Apparently “FilaGalom” had written to Schaefer thanking him for referring the new customer,David Kelly. Schaefer accused Kelly of treachery in going behind his back tocultivate his source.And so the sting crashed and burned without charges being brought against FilaGalom or any other pedophiles. The three pornographers allegedly operatingwithin the jurisdiction of North Miami Beach never materialized.In return for his cooperation as a confidential informant, Schaefer received aletter of recognition from the North Miami Police acknowledging his cooperation,and endorsing Schaefer’s transfer to a more comfortable prison. The letter wastaken into consideration by the Department of Corrections; the transfer,however, was denied.VIRTUAL BABY-RAPERIn time, David Kelly came to believe that Schaefer’s ulterior motive ininitiating this operation went beyond merely trying to get moved to a moredesirable prison. Schaefer, Kelly believes today, was striking the pose of amoral crusader as a cover for a more sinister agenda. Schaefer was not only anex-cop who killed teenage girls. Apparently he went on from that to distinguishhimself as both a serial snitch and a virtual baby-raper—a hitherto unrevealedfacet of his multifarious pathology that would qualify him for the obverseequivalent of a Triple Crown amongst the lowest of the most loathed.After the Fila Galom connection collapsed, Schaefer continued to carry on alively correspondence with various Philippine connections, and sent me over ahundred photos of ragged little brown urchins staring bleakly into the cameralens, with their names and ages written on the back along with comments like“abandoned child,” or “father dead, mother destitute.” Some are signed, “TanieArbaquez, procurer.”There is a pitiful eloquence in the ancient Asian eyes of these tiny victims.One photo of four little girls all dolled up in ballgowns, jewelry and heavymakeup is especially haunting. Schaefer wrote me that all of them had appearedin pornographic photos and videos. Tanie’s handwritten note on the back of thisone asks coyly, “What do you think of the two newfound poor souls?”image [Images/59.jpg]A tiny Eurasian who appears to be about six years old is listed as “VenusArbaquez Cross,” a name that would seem to identify her as the love child ofTanie Arbaquez and Schaefer’s scam-partner and subsequent snitch-victim, MervynEric Cross.Schaefer sent me dozens of photos of a child called Nova, whom he called his“muijai girl,” a Filipina who appears to be no older than nine whom he claimedto have bought out of the kiddie porn business and placed in a convent school.The plan he explained to me was that when Nova was old enough, he would have herbrought to him and they would marry in prison.I was shocked when Schaefer sent me swimsuit shots of his sister’s prepubescentdaughters, boasting that he had circulated similar photos of his own nieces inhis correspondence with people he called “freaks.” At times it seemed there wereno limits to his depravity.“Psychopaths like Schaefer just don’t have the same barrier as normal people dobetween circumstances,” observed Kelly. “One second they can say, ’My child diedan hour ago,’ and appear very sorrowful, and yet, ten seconds later, they can bediscussing the breakfast they had this morning, without any transition.”GOING TO DISNEY WORLDAlthough the kiddie porn sting had come to an end, Dave Kelly’s desire to learnmore about the enigma that was Gerard Schaefer led him to correspond with himfor almost a decade. “I had been extremely interested in serial killers andsexual psychopaths for many years, going back to the mid-fifties withStarkweather,” said Kelly, “and I think Schaefer was a sexual psychopath. Istrongly believe Schaefer was responsible for a lot more crimes than he wasconfined for. 1968 is the date of the first crime they attribute to him, but Ibelieve he probably started his activities in his early teen years, probably 12to 14, and I’m talking murder, not just his sexual activities.”“I questioned him very, very thoroughly about his crimes, about what he had doneor not done, and body decomposition. He had a tremendous knowledge of that,which is really unusual. But Schaefer never denied the murders. His response wasalways that guilt was not a matter of whether you did it or not, it’s a legalissue. That came through very strongly in all of his writings to me. Andlegally, he believed he was not guilty of any crimes.”“I would ask him outright, I’d say, ‘Jerry, did you kill these people?’ And henever said, ’No, I didn’t kill them,’ which would be the normal response. Hewould always go off into guilt being a legal issue.”Kelly was never able to tie Schaefer to the scene of a crime or close any oldcases. The only connection he could draw to any known cases was one ofSchaefer’s early writings that refers to himself as a police officer, stopping awoman in a white car, and then going on to murder her.Kelly was able to confirm reports of a female motorist in a white car passingthrough Wilton Manors while Schaefer was employed there as a police officer.And after being stopped by a police officer, the woman disappeared. Although nopolice reports document her identity, the case is still talked about today amongold-timers in local law enforcement circles.In conclusion, Kelly said that Schaefer seemed to be seeking acceptance. “Beinga serial killer is like going to Disney World by yourself, and not being able totake anyone with you,” he said. “I think serial killers have these tremendouslyexciting experiences, but no one to share them with. So they spend a lot of timecultivating people that they hope they will be able to talk to. They start outsmall, and they build up, hoping to get to the point where they can tell youwhat they have been doing, and you will accept it.”“These stories he has written for you,” Kelly observed, “they are in fact tests,to see how you would react to his various escalations of perversions.”BIG PERVERTSchaefer became a transvestite in order to avoid the draft, and then went on toassume a sadomasochistic female identity and establish his own slave empire,still managing to conclude, “I certainly do not regard myself a deviant.”The Society of Friends used to come onto campus and educate people innon-violent resistance. That’s how I learned about 1-Y deferments. PersonalityDisorders. Believe it or not, it’s as easy as pie to avoid the draft. Just slipon a pair of panties, wear a garter belt and nylons and voila! Instant 1-Yclassification! Really, you only need to tell the people at the Army inductioncenter you are ‘queer’ and that’s sufficient.I was drafted. I got down to the point to be sworn in, and in my best thespianmanner, asked if it was gonna be OK to be in the Army if I’m queer? There’smaybe a hundred guys there, all macho posturing and I come out with I’m a queer.Fastest dismissal you ever did see.Oh, they interrogate you a bit, but the key is to be sincere. They are lookingfor the phony faggot with the limp wrist; so you just play straight man…ofcourse I want to be in the Army, I just wondered if there was any rule againstwearing panties? Threw me right out the door.I played the role to a tee. I never hid my ‘perversion.’ Wore my nylons right toclass. Guys are in absolute despair over loss of deferments (1968-70) and I’mlaughing up my sleeve and wearing a garter girdle and never consider Vietnam asan impediment to my academic career.Same with the photos. Bondage ritual! Oh my God! Major league freak action. Inever hid them. I was very open about it. It was simply a case of doing thenecessary to get what I wanted: my university education. It’s not a crime, yet,to wear a pair of panties. If I’m a pervert because I wore garter belt andnylons to class, then I’m a pervert. I just don’t happen to give a rat fuckwhether I’m regarded as a pervert or not. My sexual orientation is 100%heterosexual. I’ve plenty of happy ladies running around alive to verify I’mquite capable of giving them a sprightly toss in bed. So I fail to understandthe ‘problem.’I certainly do not regard myself as a deviant. I’m sure Boy George laughs allthe way to the bank, as does Alice Cooper. I’m as valid an entertainer as eitherof them.image [Images/62.jpg]I’ve played before screaming fans: Hollywood Bowl. Redrocks. Madison SquareGarden. I’ve cut an album. I’m in a song book with Glenn Close. I choose towrite. I do not care for the mayhem of the concert tour.Take Jessica Zurriaga: I invented her years ago. Ran ads under her name. Made abuck. Wrote as a woman. Had about 500 ‘slaves’ and submissives answer. You trainthe slave to wash out your panties and return them with $10. I had a ladyhandling the mail for me. The slave sends the lingerie. The lady wears it, getsit nice and nasty, mails it to the slave for cleaning. I’d write the letters. Bythe way, Zurriaga is Spanish for whip. More nuance.So I’m writing to the freaks. The prison censors pick up on it. Confiscate mymail. Give it to the psychologist. They stick me in Sex Education!! I go see theshrink; I say, 1 run a fucking slave empire.’ The guy is entranced; he cannotbelieve I’m pulling it off. I convinced him. No more sex education classes. Ibecome the joke of the prison, but I’m laughing because guys pay to wash thepanties of my bitch. Big pervert. Sure. But I’m raking in the coin, ain’t I?So my experiences have been varied with my various correspondents. As a creativewriter, it’s been fun. All that was years ago. I used my talents to catch childsex perverts until just recently.FROM GUILT TO VIOLENCE“I know all about the prostitution game in Florida,” said Schaefer. He wouldhave us believe he learned this information by continuing his research frombehind bars. Certainly he continued to develop new forms of sexual exploitationduring his incarceration, still it must be remembered that several of hisvictims have mentioned that his conversations as long ago as 1969 includedreferences to the white slave trade. Regardless of how he developed his insideinformation about what perverts do to children, he does point out the disturbingconsequences of our attempts to control such behavior by maximizing sentencingguidelines.“Take all these ‘missing’ children. A certain number of those kids are grabbedby kiddie porn people who make film and photos and then dump the kid off shorewith an anchor around his or her neck. In Florida, any guy even touch a girlunder age 12 on her cunnus or anus it’s 25 to life mandatory. And if the‘victim’ says, ’he rubbed his finger between my legs,’ that’s all the lawrequires. The uncorroborated statement of the ‘victim.’“These procurers pick up a cute runaway, take her out on a fancy yacht intointernational waters, and believe me, she (or he) don’t come back when the partyis over. Ain’t nobody gonna prove nothing either. Give the girlie a needle toput her out, strap a diver’s weight belt around her waist, and over the side in500 feet of water. Girl? What girl? And the sad thing is the reason the kid iskilled is because it ain’t worth the risk to let the kid go when you can get 25to life on unsupported testimony.“Remember Veile Groves out in Davie? Sent old man Veile up for possession ofalbums of photos of nude girls 12 to 14 years old. The girls were paid models.He’d hire them right off the streets. Nude modeling. No suckee/fuckec stuff. Thegirls all loved him. Nice man. Cops found out about it. Busted him. Sent him up.He’d have gotten a lesser pop for armed robbery. He’d get less time for killingone of these girls in a fit of passion than having sex with her. Now is thatcrazy or what?” In a psychoanalytic aside, Schaefer concludes, “It’s all builton guilt, by the way. Guilt breeds frustration, frustration breeds anger, andanger manifests in violence.”PICTURE BRIDEIn 1979, Schaefer started calling himself “married” to a “picture bride,” adiminutive Filipina named Elen. She sent him photos from her native village ofherself looking like a prepubescent child, inscribed “To my loving husbandGerard.”In July of 1980, she arrived in St. Petersburg, Florida, where she joined thehousehold of Gerard Schaefer, Senior, and his second wife. A marriage licensewas somehow obtained naming “Gerard Schaefer” as the husband and Elen as thewife. This document was then submitted to prison authorities at Avon ParkCorrectional Institution, who subsequently allowed the portly, balding serialkiller to have contact visits with her.Schaefer explained to me that when brought Elen over to this country, heexpected her to be a submissive peasant who would show enough sense to expressher gratefulness for being sponsored.Instead, it became apparent that Elen had been accustomed to being courted inthe finest style, and expected if not champagne and caviar, at least flowers andperfume. She continued to live with either Schaefer’s father in Tampa or withhis mother in Ft. Lauderdale, making the best of a dubious situation for fiveyears.image [Images/64a.jpg]Schaefer’s picture bride apparently realized that neither he nor his father weregoing to keep her in the style to which she would like to become accustomed, sowhen she got her green card in 1985, she moved on, leaving Schaefer a single manonce again.image [Images/64b.jpg]PRISON MURDERIn May of 1988, Schaefer witnessed a shocking prison murder that uncannilypresaged his own.Two guards were escorting Alfred Moore, who was restrained in shackles andchains, from his cell, when Doy Christian shoved them aside and shanked Mooretodeath, tossing his bloody body off the third-floor cellblock.Defense testimony by Department of Corrections personnel and inmates relatedthat the murder was the culmination of a running battle between the two startingtwo weeks earlier, when Moore came up behind Christian while he was playingcards and smashed him over the head with a weight-lifting bar, knocking him out.Over the ensuing two-week period, Moore taunted, insulted, and threatenedChristian until Christian, in his own words, “just blew up.”“I was a witness to this murder,” wrote Schaefer. “The State forced me to givetestimony about it. Told me to talk or I’d be sent to the strip cells. I talked.Blamed the whole thing on the guards who ran away and let the guy be choppedinto Alpo. Christian really did a job on him. Lake of blood. Stabbed out hiseyes. Moore deserved getting a shank, but Christian ended up getting theelectric chair for it. All this occurred in a “Protective Custody” area! {Smileyface} Goes to show you how much P.C. means at FSP. Zip…that’s why they sent meup here. {Frowny face}.”THE OFFICIAL VERSIONDecember 3, 1995.Schaefer stepped up to the water cooler and filled two mugs with the last of thehot water. As he turned around, what did he see behind him but his worstnightmare in the flesh—Vincent Rivera—big and black, lean and mean, and half hisage.Rivera communicated his displeasure at having no hot water to warm his bonesthat chilly Sunday morning. Schaefer responded that if it hadn’t been for him,there would be no water cooler on the tier in the first place, because it was hewho had kept pushing for it.Rivera was said to have muttered an aside to the effect that Schaefer wouldn’tneed no more hot water where he was going.THE TABLOID VERSIONIn February of 1996, the National Enquirer ran a story headlined “Killer set toreveal Adam Walsh’s fate is murdered in jail,” and tagged “New heartache for‘America’s Most Wanted’ host.” The story called Gerard John Schaefer the lasthope for John Walsh and his wife Reve, who were said to be “sick at heart”because since Schaefer was dead, they would never solve the mystery of thedisappearance of their 5-year-old son Adam in 1981.The story goes on to suggest that the prime suspect, confessed serial killerOttis Toole, had some connection to Schaefer’s murder. The principal source forthis theory was his mother, Mrs. Doris Schaefer. In a telephone conversationwith me on February 25, 1996, she confirmed that she had been quoted accurately.This, then, is her story:Last November, Toole, who’s dying of cancer, told my son everything—how hekilled Adam Walsh and where the little boy’s remains were. My son spoke to aninspector at the prison, and he arranged for Detective Mark Smith, who is incharge of the Walsh case, to interview him in prison. When they met, Schaefertold Detective Smith he’d reveal the whereabouts of Adam’s body only if he wastransferred to Avon Park, a “better prison.” He was told that would be up to theprison officials. My son knew where Adam’s body is—and somebody wanted him dead.Some friends in prison told me that after Detective Smith’s visit, word wentaround that my son was a snitch.With all due respect to Mrs. Schaefer and the National Enquirer, the word aboutSchaefer being a snitch had been going around for years. A more accurateassessment of the situation by one prison insider is that Schaefer had tried toget information from Toole when they were once again housed on the same wing,but this time Toole was well aware of what Schaefer was up to, and gave him nonew information at all. It seems self-evident that if Detective Mark Smithbelieved Schaefer had learned anything of value from Toole, he would have beenable to obtain that information from so willing an informant. The fact that hewent back home empty-handed speaks for itself.Schaefer had been trying to sell the bones of Adam Walsh since 1988. It was thenthat Toole’s health declined, and believing he had cancer, he agreed withSchaefer’s suggestion to come clean and confess to his crimes, since he wasgoing to die anyway. Schaefer then tried to broker Toole’s confessions to JohnWalsh, taunting the bereaved father in a cruelly obscene letter that does notbear repeating here.Toole did not have cancer, and in fact went on to recant all his confessions,and to outlive Schaefer. Shortly after Schaefer’s murder, however, Toole wasagain hospitalized with hepatitis B and C, and he died of liver failure inSeptember of 1996.There is no evidence that Ottis Toole has ever had any contact with Schaefer’saccused slayer. Nor was Toole the type of convict to take out hits. A man oflowly estate, he was as much the classic disorganized type serial killer asSchaefer was the classic organized type.After a series of especially nonproductive questions about the details of hislife in an interview with Joel Norris and myself, Toole squinted and shook hishead, saying, “Look, most people keep track of things. I don’t keep track ofnothin’. Most times, I don’t even know if it’s day or night. “THE DEFENDANT’S VERSIONVincent Rivera was indicted for Schaefer’s murder on February 1, 1996. InNovember of 1996, I sent Rivera a letter, inviting him to comment on theslaying.Ironically, the accused slayer portrays himself as an innocent man framed formurder. And the Disney imagery again seems appropriate.Rivera’s claim that he has not even been charged with this crime makes a fittingcoda to the story of the serial killer who once loved me; he was ultimately asunknowable in death as he had been in life.The guy you asked me if I have met, Toole, no, I don’t know him. Who is he? Whois Adam Walsh?I guess you’ve read a lot of trash in the newspapers. Those newspapers are goingto catch hell in a libel and slander suit. I’m up to my ears with hearsay,gainsay, rumors, gossip…you name it. But no facts. The F.D.L.E. don’t have any.The state’s attorney don’t have any. Nobody has any facts…except me.There’s about ten tons of paperwork being conjured up. The state’s attorney is aregular David Copperfield. He might as well be making motorcycles fly or theStatue of Liberty disappear. The newspapers and any “witnesses” are all liars.Ten months later, now they know they are liars.Pretty soon they’ll do like Felix the Cat and reach into their bag of tricks.But there is no such thing as magic. If there were, I’d get myself a few magiccharms, cast a few spells, and abracadabra, POOF! I’d have myself a real lawyer,instead of a cartoon.image [Images/67.jpg]But this isn’t a cartoon. It isn’t Disney World—even though Mickey Mouse, DonaldDuck and Goofy are my lawyers, and Hekyll and Jekyll are the prosecutors, withBugs Bunny is sitting on the bench.In a nutshell, the situation is not copacetic with me. They got the wrongguy…and they know it. They got two guys, one alive and one dead. They found aknife. Ten months ago they called it “the murder weapon.” Six months ago, afterthe crime lab report, they found out the “murder weapon” had no blood on it andno prints. They found bloody handprints in the dead guy’s cell—whole handprints—ten months ago. Six months ago, the crime lab reports showed the bloodyhand prints did not match me—the live body, or Schaefer—the dead body.Don’t for a minute swallow that water cooler crap. The guy that started thatmyth tried to get himself a transfer with the inspector ordering it, so he madeup a whopper. They didn’t swallow it and he didn’t get the transfer. That waseleven months ago. In September, 1996, that same guy told my attorney, MickeyMouse, that he had made up that fairy tale to get out of FSP. Mickey Mouse thenwent to Hekyll and Jekyll with the deposition admitting he made that garbage up.FYI, baby, I didn’t even use the water from that cooler. Four years ago, when Iwas at CCI, there was a nurse that told me asked me if I have ever noticed howmany young guys in their twenties and thirties have receding hairlines or aregoing bald? I told her, now that you mention it, yeah. She told me the watercoolers in the buildings have hot water taps. That hot water is heated withelement coils, electricity that puts out radiation. Those guys give themselvesradiation therapy like cancer patients with every cup of hot water. Even thoughthe exposure is mild, try going to a hospital and sitting under thoseradiographical thingamabobs all day every day, all night every night, year afteryear, and what do you think would happen? Same concept with electric hot water.No siree bob, not me! First your hair thins out, then your teeth fall out, oneat a time, then your immune system gets messed up, then you die a slow agonizingdeath from leukemia, bone cancer, or intestinal cancer. There ain’t no cup ofhot water in the world worth that. One day standing in line for the watercooler, next day standing in line for a state-issued grave? NO! NO! NO! Not me.Look, darling, I’m no coward, but if I gotta die, I prefer to be mauled by aschool of Mako sharks in a feeding frenzy, than to suffer from radiationsickness.The institution inspector that headed that murder investigation couldn’t wait tohave me charged with a prison killing. Number one, I didn’t kill somebody, Ididn’t kill anybody, I didn’t kill nobody, and I didn’t kill Schaefer. Numbertwo, the inspector that did the investigation is a.k.a. “Mister Cover-up,”“Mister Clean-it-up,” “Mister Bold-Faced Liar.” He was fired in June of 1996. Hewas uncovered covering up once too often.For crying out loud, I haven’t even been duly arraigned yet. So let’s hold offon this for now, OK? I’m not flipping you off, it’s just that the thing is likecow manure, all over the place, and I’m tired of the stench."},{"pageContent":"KILLER FICTION"},{"pageContent":"SCHAEFER’S WARNINGI was falsely accused of killing 34 women; I was framed by corrupt men. Ibelieve that God allowed this to happen to me for a special reason.I have indeed suffered greatly, but always I have relied upon God to protect andguide me.I was called America’s number one serial killer at one time, and that gives me acertain status. I can use that celebrity in a socially positive or negative way.I’ve chosen to take the socially positive path by exposing in graphic prose thevileness of murder, the horror of prison life, and the degrading spectacle ofstate-endorsed executions. Perhaps my revelations will lead to social change.image [Images/71.jpg]Many critics have stated that my books are pornographic, incite people toviolence, and glorify murder. I cannot continue to write books if people readthem and become corrupted. My intention in writing I Killer Fiction was to openthe eyes of readers to the horrifying actualities of murder and violence. Murderis a cardinal sin, a capital crime, that has been reduced to entertainment byfilm and television producers.Bret Ellis and Thomas Harris write books that glorify perverted sex and violenceand bloody murder; I write books that cause the reader to reexamine his entiresocial conscience with respect to violent crime as entertainment. I rather thinkGod would be pleased that someone would be brave enough to take such a position.Some day I’ll have to meet God, and hopefully, He will be pleased with my effortto make people think about the vile social issues addressed in my books.My own books make no compromise in the presentation. I give you bloody murder insuch a way that you recoil from it. My reader is not given a cheap thrill, butan emotional whipping. A person with a depraved mind may read my work and revelin the lust, sex and filthy crime portrayed there, but a person of noble socialconscience will recognize the horrifying malignancies that I present boldly, andcry out for a positive change that may alter the diseased social attitudes thatallow such gross acts of savagery to occur.This book is a work of fiction. It is the duty of a competent fiction writer toinflame the imagination of his readers. This book will give you sleeplessnights. Any person who reads it will never see murder as pure entertainmentagain. It is not intended to casually shock the reader. It delivers a serioussocial message, and some of my more insightful readers have discerned that atthe core of my work is a lifesaving message, especially for my female fans.My work deals almost exclusively with modern social taboos, many of whichinvolve sexual perversity. It’s not about sex. It’s about the intermingling ofsexual perversion and incomprehensible madness.There is an undeniable sexual relationship that exists in the area of violentdeath, whether the violence is lawless murder or official execution. My books donot explore the causes of sexually-related violence, they merely graphicallyportray its existence in a way that no other books dare. My books address sexualperversions that exist without justification within our society, but I do notendorse those perversions.My ability to write is a gift from God. It is my duty to use that gift well.Many people make the error of believing that my books chronicle actual eventsthat I have personally been involved in; that supposition is untrue. During thepast twenty years in prison, I have spoken to many criminals and listened tomany stories about murder. I have made a study of murder and the people whokill.I believe it is socially irresponsible to glorify violence, sadism, sexualperversion and murder in books and films. My work is an attempt to wake upcitizens of the world community to the casual disregard for human life that theglorification of violence encourages by presenting violence, murder andexecution as it really is; that is a positive use of my talent for a worthypurpose.My own personal belief in Jesus Christ assures me of my future as a child ofGod, but that does not excuse me from helping my fellow man. If my works savethe life of even one person, then that is their ultimate worth, and like the manin the parable, I will be rewarded for using my talents wisely.I write these words from solitary confinement at one of America’s mostdisgusting and repressive prisons. I expect to be punished for daring to speaktruths, but only by publishing the voices of the slaves will the world ever knowthe truth about the American Gulags.It may also interest my readers to know that I receive no monetary compensationfor my work. What I have written I wrote because I believe the message containedin the books. My reward, if any, will be a spiritual one.image [Images/72.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"WHORES: WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEMSPRING BREAKI turned off Sunrise Boulevard and walked along Sunrise Lane, finally stoppingat the World Famous Parrot Lounge.I frowned as I looked at it, almost closing time and my chance to score waslooking bleaker with each passing moment. There was an indifferent surfer typein a green T-shirt at the door checking ID’s. I showed him mine and he motionedme inside. The sudden light made me squint.The Parrot was crowded and chaotic. College types, and nearly all were drunk.They wore a uniform of sweatshirts and jeans touting fraternities, sororitiesand institutions of higher learning from up and down the Eastern Seaboard: Yale,Oberlin, Ohio State, Tennessee Tech, and a host of others. The students were allshouting and laughing; on the dance floor they were writhing and swaying to thebeat of Mick Jagger’s hoarse “I Can’t Get No…Satisfaction.” I liked it. I’dscouted the Parrot before, it was a happy hunting ground. I looked around at thewomen. There was a real nice selection to choose from. I watched them gyrate andfelt the old tingle in my crotch. Fucking college cunt. They were a curse and ablessing.The bar was jammed with a throng of sweaty bodies. I had to force I my waythrough to buy a drink. Two bucks for a lousy 7&7. I paid the bartender andpushed my way back toward the dance floor; found myself a semiprivate spot nextto a cement pillar and surveyed the action. I was feeling good. Vibrant. I drankmy Seagrams and drilled a path through the smoky haze with my eyes. Strobelights flashed through the swirling murk. My face was flushed with hotanticipation.Then I saw the little bitch. She was standing alone under a sign flashing“EXIT.” She was suntanned and slender, wearing a virginal white silk blouse witha tight thigh-high miniskirt. The ash blonde hair surrounding her patrician faceswirled around her like an angelic halo. Her plump full bosom pressed invitinglyagainst the fabric of her transparent top. I could see the cups and straps andthe deep cleavage beneath.I felt the familiar chill course through me. The icy instinctual lust that wouldslide down my spine, gently squeeze my balls, and leave my loins inflamed withsudden heat. My dick began to unfurl in my shorts. My mind clarified while Iwatched the light wash over the girl and bathe her face in a soft radiance. Mytension subsided, replaced by quiet resolve.The girl was sipping a Vodka Collins. She sipped slowly, with a daintiness thatunderscored her overt femininity. Her eyes were emerald green. They were slidingabout the lounge in a distracted manner, reflecting the studied boredom of aJunior League society bitch. It made me want to kill her.I sensed this feeling at once. My senses rarely let me down. My intenseperception pleases me; it helps me to be a success at what I do well. Her greeneyes caught my own of violet blue. She stared boldly, shivered, flipped away hergaze with a toss of her hair. I remained there staring, willing her to come tome, drawing her shining sun into the black hole of my own orbit.I slapped her face with a psychic command. She didn’t move. The pull wasn’tworking. Yet her eyes, as if in obedience to my dark authority, slowly turnedtoward my face again. I didn’t smile. I studied her face. She dropped her eyes;they flickered toward the dance floor, landed there, and bounced with the rhythmof the dancers. That displeased me. I firmed my lips and strode across the roomuntil I stood right in front of her, blocking her view. Now she had nowhere elseto look. She had to look right at me. She didn’t recognize the ancient face ofdeath; so I spoke to her.“I’m Jerry. Do you mind if I talk to you?”Miss Junior League studied me vaguely, blinked a message of indifference, raisedher frosted glass to her painted lips and sipped her vodka. She held the tallglass with both hands shielding her mouth, peering over its rim. Coy. Cute. Thestrobe lights cast a blue tint over her features. Cyan suited her. I was movedto strangle her, felt my fingers curl at the thought of encircling the slenderneck.“What do you want?” she asked.I liked her voice. It had a soft, bored, sexy tone. Languorous. Her accent wasfinishing-school classy with an underlying hint of arrogance. She was a collegecunt out slumming, spending Daddy’s money. I wanted her…dead.“Company. Unless you think I’m bugging you.”“No, you’re not ‘bugging me.’ Not yet, at any rate,” she sniped. Flashed hereyes at me with haughty insouciance. She had too much money; too many cotillionswith callow boys dancing attendance to her every whim. That life was over, shejust didn’t know it yet.It reminded me of the time I’d cut off a hitchhiker’s head with a machete andset it on a stump. I’d noticed how the eyes in the head were alive, moving,watching the decapitated body kicking and writhing. I’d tapped the head with myknuckles and asked, “Are you alive in there?” then added, “If you’re in there,blink your eyes.” And the eyes stared at me and blinked. It was spooky. Thehitchhiker was dead, yet undead. It took her a few minutes to realize what hadhappened before she could settle down and die. This one with her snotty airsreminded me of that interesting girl. Would this turn out to be anothermemorable affair?“I drove down from Rollins for the weekend. It’s my first time in Lauderdale,” Ilied. “I came in here and I didn’t know a soul, then I saw you alone. I don’tenjoy the loneliness. I thought, what a nice-looking girl, and well…here I am.”“I’ve been here a few hours,” she said, softening. “I came in with some othergirls from our house. We’re Tri-Delts. They met some Dekes from Boston College.They’ve gone to the Elbo Room and now I’m about to leave myself. Just as soon asI finish up my drinky.”“I’ll get you another little drinky if you’ll stick around.”“No thanks. I’d better not.”“Why not? We can dance.”“I know. I’m half tiddly already. I wouldn’t want to end up like the Tiddly Totfrom Agnes Scott.” She crinkled up her eyes with a mischievous thought.“How did the Tiddly Tot end up?”She cocked a plucked eyebrow at me. “Preggers. Preggers under the moonlight,compliments of her beau from Tech. Who taught her how to neck. And a few otherlittle things, as well I suspect.”“He should have been wearing rubbers when fooling around in a wet place.”“Really?” She stared boldly.I returned her stare with one of my own. Studied her demeanor thoughtfully. Shewas still vague but venturing out near the edge. She was rolling the long dampCollins glass between her hands. Something was on her mind, troubling her. Ihave excellent instincts for that. Her indecision made her vulnerable. I likethem uncertain. I play with their emotions before I play with their bodies.Mindfuck them before the more disgusting act is consummated.“What’s your name? Where’s your school?” I asked.“Gwendolyn. Gwendolyn Kent. I’m a senior at Smith. We’re down for spring break.We’re having fun.” She took another dainty lady sip from her dwindling drinky.“Gwendolyn is a long name,” I said to keep her moving her mouth, and she gushedfor me.“It’s an awful name. Everyone calls me ‘Gwen.’ Well, my mother calls meGwendolyn, of course, but on campus I’m just Gwen.”Suddenly some female part of her sensed the unspoken message, felt the lustradiating out toward her. She looked up. Studied me with new eyes. Saw I wastall and athletically built, powerfully muscled, with a deepwater tan and sharp,fine features. Handsome, with a delightful spill of sun bleached blonde hair anda dark mustache. She sensed my experience with women, noted my fraternity pin, aminor badge of social class structure. She watched my bright but unrevealingviolet eyes, misread the trace of smoldering passion shining through the alcoholfor something that would stoke her own erotic fires, instead of extinguishingthem. Like others before her, she was thinking that a girl could do much worse;that there wasn’t much remaining time before closing. She was right and she wasdead wrong. Like the Tiddly Tot, Gwen’s wet cunt would be the death of her. Iknew it the moment she raised her glass and fluttered her eyelashes at medemurely over the rim.I decided to kill her. I drew her death warrant with my intellect and signed itwith my will. The decision was devoid of reason. I felt a heaviness in my balls,a lightness in my head. A heightened sexuality enveloped me in a circle almosthumming with emotion. I felt the acrid mixture of marijuana and tobacco smokeswirl up my nostrils to tickle my brain, and enhance my emerging insanity.The laughter was bawdy, glasses rattled and tinkled with ice, and Jim Morrisonwas alive and urging us on, “Come on baby, light my fire.”I stepped closer to the spoiled bitch. The lounge was crowded, so there wasn’tmuch choice, but I liked it close once the final decision has been made. Gwenglanced up, and favored me with a cozy smile, but it was a smile full ofhesitation, almost remote. I would bring her up from the depths of herlassitude, crystallize her attention; I’d teach her the meaning of her life andsend her off into the void. I spread myself around her, sucked her into myself,bending her to my suggestions and my will. I would drain her juices, her verysoul, and discard the empty husk. My eye was drawn to her breast and caught thefraternity pin.“You’re pinned,” I said.“Oh, you noticed the pin! How very observant of you. Scouting out what you needto know. Men are like that, aren’t they? Always curious. Looking under rocks,peering into nooks and crannies. Exploring. But women have the nosy reputation.How do you figure that?” She pouted.I gave her a slow charming grin. “It’s not the pin, Gwen, it’s the location ofthe thing.” I brought my own glass up and watched her reaction over the rim.“Location?” She asked coyly, knowing exactly what I meant.“Sure. Hanging out there on the end of your teats, how could I miss it?”She sucked in her breath. I let my animal vitality come to the surface, drew hertoward me with erotic steely-eyed magnetism. I was confident, knowing. Shelooked into my eyes and saw shadows that she’d never be able to fathom. It madeher uneasy and curious, which in turn made me more attractive to her. I watchedthe color rise in her cheeks and knew what she was feeling as clearly as if itwas written across her forehead in blood: she wanted my touch. She would feel itsoon. My penis stiffened a bit at the thought.I shifted slightly so she could see the outline of the half-erection. A tinyquiver ran through her as she picked up on the bulge. Women want hard dick,don’t let them fool you on that score. Gwen wasn’t fooling me. Her body wasbetraying her while I watched. I finished off my drink.“How about another vodka?” I asked.“I really shouldn’t.”“Tell me about it.”“One, because I’m really tired; two, because I’m already ‘half in the bag’ asthey say; and three, it might make me do things I’ll regret later. Want somemore good reasons?” She showed a trace of crossness, annoyed with herself forwhat she knew she was going to do.“Have another one. I insist.”She looked at me. Saw I wanted her drunk. She smiled and nodded. “I won’t beresponsible for what may happen.”“You’ve never been responsible for anything in your whole life, have you?” Thestatement stung like a whip.She opened her mouth. Shut it. Looked at her hands. “Nope. You’re right. I’m myDaddy’s little girl.”“And somebody else’s besides Daddy’s too, eh?”She shrugged and looked away.I fetched her another Vodka Collins. Handed it to her and watched as she tookher first sip. She closed her eyes and sighed, opened them and swept the crowd.Maybe looking for the boy whose pin she had placed over her two-timing heart.“What house are you in, Jerry?”“Why, Sigma Tau Sigma. Is there any other?”“Actually I’ve never heard of Sigma Tau Sigma. Are you national?”“Sure. But mainly in the South. Social frat. Party animals. We do it in theroad.”She let that one slide and said, “Where are the Brothers tonight?”“Mostly still cramming for finals. I’ve done mine. Getting a jump on the actionhere on Lauderdale Beach.”“Where are you staying?”“The Jolly Roger,” I lied.“We’re at the Yankee Clipper. It’s a long walk down the beach from here.”“The Jolly Roger’s not too far down A1A…and they have big soft beds.”Furtively, Gwen glanced around her. The room was a roar of conversation andmusic. She seemed unsteady from the alcohol and smoke. She looked directly atme. I looked straight back at her. I loomed over her and beamed my masculinepresence down upon her, let her feel it like a physical pressure. She wasblushing again, caught up in some cuntish fantasy of erotic release. She knewwhat she wanted when she walked in the door. I was the answer to that annoyingitch between her legs. Her body was not going to be denied tonight. She knew it.I knew it. But what she was thinking shamed her. She fought with herself in aneffort to deny the message that shimmered up from between her legs on waves offemale heat. She studied me; knew instinctively that my touch would be fearless,that I would guide her and set her body aflame. I blessed her with a casual andconfident smile, let her see that I was a world unto myself. That I would strokeher and make her purr with ecstasy. She wanted it. Shamelessly. She raised herdrink, finished it off with one gulp. The alcohol would work its magic in herbrain, drowning her resistance; soon the spreading slime would flood her genitalcrease. I’d smell it on her. She held out her glass and said, “I need just onemore, and then I’m leaving.”She’d be leaving all right. I wouldn’t want to deprive her of her one lastdrinky. I went back to the bar, ordered the drinks and paid for them, and mademy way back to the nervous bitch.She took the glass from my hand, put it to her mouth, and drank deeply. Theemerald eyes were streaked red from the smoke hanging in the air like an acridblue fog. There were bubbles of greasy sweat sprinkled across her forehead atthe hairline. Her lipstick was smeared. Not even a thank-you for SteppinFetchit.“I find you attractive, Gwen.”“I’ve heard that line before,” she snapped.“You look pretty tonight.”“Do I?” She was uncertain.“Yes, very.” Reassure her. Coddle the bitch.“You’re gonna make a lewd proposition, I can feel it coming. Am I right?” shechallenged. I looked down and let my gaze linger on her bosom. Smiled.“A seductive proposition was more what I had in mind,” I countered. “You appealto my natural instincts.”“Seduction as a natural instinct. What an interesting theory. Did you pick thatup in Psych 101 up there at Rollins, or is that a regional philosophy? Maybe Ihaven’t heard this line after all.” She raised her Collins and swallowed anotherhefty gulp.“Down South we don’t deny our natural instincts. Up Nawth where you Puritanscome from natural instincts are the same as mortal sins, aren’t they?” hedrawled. She grinned at the ceiling—rolling her eyes in feigned despair.“I suppose you think all Ivy Leaguers are gay?”“You mean to tell me they’re not? I can’t believe that. I met this guy fromAmherst, he’s carrying around this poodle. GAY RIGHTS TASK FORCE blazoned on hissweatshirt. Went about one-forty soaking wet, limp wrist and all. At Rollinswe’d have run his ass off campus on a rail. Sex perversion is illegal inFlorida. Normal in New York and points north, that’s what I hear.”Gwen drank her vodka and smiled some more. “Tell me about your ‘naturalinstincts’ theory, Jerry.”“I’m a red-blooded American boy, and I do what I gotta do. And I gotta do itwith a woman.”“Male chauvinist piggy-wiggy! Oink-oink!”“You’re not the first to say that. But I don’t let my instincts bother me. Ienjoy sex—that is, lovemaking—all the pleasures of romance. I’ve studied theKama Sutra. I’ve learned that adult women prefer seduction.”She arched her back like a cat, flaunted the swell of her breasts and opinedprimly, “I thought it bothered every man. My boyfriend gets the ‘guilts’ everytime. Actually he’s a little straitlaced for a man. That’s what I think,” shecomplained.“Me, I have needs. I accept them as natural, and I don’t suffer any guilt whenmy needs are satisfied. Dr. Freud wouldn’t find me a very interesting specimen,I’m afraid.”“I rather think he would,” Gwen remarked.I gave her a quizzical look. She gave me a wink in return, then opened her eyeswide with innocence. Touchè. But I had her. My every sense told me so. I saw itin the sparkle of her eyes, heard it in her seeking words. I knew I’d win. Hervulnerability shone through her tiredness in her restlessness, her need to talk.She was another romantic and troubled cunt—full of alcohol and the surgingemotion that nibbled away at her will, and set her up for me. I knew what Iwanted: the darkness, the moonlight, her naked white body in my hands.She was sipping her drink and looking at me, smiling a vague invitation, hermoist eyes tentative yet bold. I inched closer to her, and smiled back withconspiratorial understanding. We were close, almost touching, and in the smallspace between our bodies I could smell the lusty heat of her satin flesh, themusk emanating from her secret place below. I flared my nostrils like a stallionas I sucked in the aroma of her desire.“No guilt,” she breathed.“None at all,” I answered, giving her the push she needed to send her over theedge. “I don’t see how guilt could enter into it.”“Oh? Well, how do you see it?”“I see it as normal.”“Just…normal?”“Sure. We both want the same thing, don’t we?”She hesitated. Nodded.“So we seek each other out, dig? You have needs, don’t you?” She lowered hereyes, and ran her hands through her hair restlessly. Shrugged.“Don’t worry about love and marriage, and lifetime commitment. Just think interms of need. You feel it, don’t you?” I lowered my voice and leaned closer toher face. “People feed you this line about ‘sin.’ You’ve heard it?”She bobbed her head.“Well forget it. It doesn’t make sense because it doesn’t even exist. Not forpeople like me. I get pleasure from a woman. And she can get all the pleasureshe wants from me.”Gwen crossed her legs and placed her hand unconsciously over her heart as shetook a deep breath.“Why worry, Gwen? You’ve got the body of a woman, I can see that. But are you areal woman inside, or just a schoolgirl playing make-believe on spring break?”I let my eyes linger on the full curves of her body. I could see the flush riseon her exposed breasts as the booze fueled her own lewd notions. The line was agood one, tested and true. She should be feeling the tingle of the promisedorgasm in the veiled offer right now. She shifted her legs again. Her footstarted to jiggle.She peered up at me. She was drawn toward my calm, seductive confidence. She sawintriguing, unrevealing eyes, and saw in their shadows how they could turnintensely passionate. She could see I wanted her body, and that my need wasimmediate. She sensed that I had the capacity to satisfy her. Even as her headswam with alcohol and desire, I knew what she would do. Beneath her skirt, herpanties were already slick with her intent. I could smell the heat in her wetcunt. She gulped down her drink and handed me the empty glass.“Let’s do it,” I said, tired of being her busboy.She squirmed a bit and said, “I’ve got to pee.” I watched her lurch off to theladies room, then carried the empty glasses back to the bar. A few minutes latershe came sauntering toward me, face washed, lipstick freshened. She took my armpossessively and said, “I think I need some fresh air.”I didn’t argue. I guided her across the room and out the door marked “EXIT.” Weemerged into darkness. I steered her north on Sunrise Lane. The moon was high,the stars twinkling merrily. Gwen looked up at the sky and stumbled. Thealcohol. I took her by the elbow, held her tightly. My Dingo boots rang on thesidewalk as we strode toward the bright lights of Sunrise Boulevard.When we got to Sunrise, I steered her away from the beach, toward the bridgespanning the Intracoastal. As we stood on the corner of Breakers and Sunrise, Iheld her close to me. The late night traffic slid past. Drivers saw a pair oflovers, dismissing them from mind instantly.“Where are we going?” Gwen said.“To the park,” he told her. “You’re a little drunk and you wanted some freshair. We can sit down on a bench for a while and watch the moonlight on theIntracoastal Waterway. It’s lovely. Quiet and private. We’ll kiss. I’ll holdyou. You’ll feel better. Trust me.”“There’s a park around here? Right on the beach?”“Sure. Birch State Park. See the sign there across Sunrise? It’s huge. Bigtrees, nature paths. You’ll like it. A nice walk in the moonlight is just whatwe need—romantic too.”“We won’t get in trouble going in there at night, will we?”“What do you mean ‘get in trouble’?”“You know, rapists. Killers. I’m thinking of something like that.”I chuckled. “This is Birch State Park in Fort Lauderdale, not Central Park inNew York City.”“It’s safe then?”“Sure. You’re not alone. You’re with your man.” I gave her waist a squeeze.There was a break in the traffic and we dashed across Sunrise. Her heels clickedon the cement. I held her arm, felt the blood rushing through it, and discerneda hot shiver of anticipation sliding down into my balls, once again causing mypenis to stir. The drunken slut made me aware of the urgency of my need as shestumbled along, giggling and lightheaded with vodka and soda water. She seemedamazed at her own daring. She leaned into me. Her body was warm and soft, fullof blood and filth. I wanted her. I would enter her body. Know her secrets.Endure her conversation. Steal her life.I led the girl into the vastness of Birch State Park. Her head was leaning on myshoulder. She had her arm around my waist. I could feel her cigarette-scentedmane caressing my cheek. The bitch was agreeably sluggish. I held her close tome. She looked up at me and smiled as I guided her along the trail into the deepwoods. We were swallowed by the night.The girl was not a problem. Her thoughts were probably on the prospect oflovemaking to come. I saw the shifting shadows beneath the trees; heard therustle of nocturnal creatures in the darkness. I sensed no fear in her, only apulsing sexuality alive with energy and expectation. The alcohol would mask anywarning signals until it was too late. It was already too late for this one. TheAustralian pines whispered around us. The pine needles were a soft carpetbeneath our feet, the secluded path ended at a seawall. She gasped at the vistaspread before us.“It’s a lovely sight, isn’t it?” I said.“What is that place over there?”“That’s the Yacht Club…a big restaurant on the left where boaters can pull up,and over on the right back in that cove are ritzy homes along Seminole Drive.Jew developers steal the whole area from the Indians and then name a streetafter them. Isn’t that a laugh?”“It’s romantic,” she breathed.I gently pressed her back against the bole of a palm tree. I fingered thefraternity pin shining on the slope of her bosom. “Who’s the lucky boy?”As the moon shown down on us, a tendril of cloud scooted across the night skyand darkened Gwen’s face. “Bobby.” She spit the name out as if it brought abitter taste to her mouth.“He doesn’t take you for moonlight walks?”She shook her head mournfully.I twisted the emblem. The silk split and the pin came off in my hand. I flippedit into the water. Put my hand on her breast, massaged her nipple.“My blouse…““I’ll buy you a new one. What does this Bobby fucker do for you?”“Not enough,” she hissed.I caressed her teat firmly with the palm of my hand then tickled the nipplegently. “Tell me about Bobby. Why doesn’t he love your titties like I do? Maybehe’s a queer, huh?”“He’d rather get high than take the time to do what you’re doing.” Her toes werecurling with pleasure as I continued to knead and tickle her breasts.“And Gwen’s high is sex?”She hummed her acknowledgment.“What happened tonight?” I tweaked her nipple.“Oooh! The usual. We argued. I told him to take his dreary ass back to the hoteland he could see me when I come back. If I come back. He has a nasty temper.”“Oh, does he now?”“He wants me to be his little vestal virgin.”“You’re a shameless rutting slut.”She rolled her hips.“It never seems to move him…except to anger.”“Bobby’s not a considerate lover?”“Never. He uses me. He fucks over me.”“Leaves you all tense and unfulfilled?”“Always.”“Drags you through the emotional mud of his post-coital guilt trips?”“Yes, Dr. Freud,” she giggled.“He’s a regular shit, isn’t he?”“A very rich shit.”“Daddy’s money?”“Of course.”“Gonna make that money all your own, hey?”“Sure. Right after we graduate. It’s the American way.”“He the jealous type?”“God, yes!” She pressed her teat into my hand. She was getting aroused by mylight teasing caresses.“What if he knew what we were doing right now?”She tensed for a beat. “He’d kill me. And his father would buy him out of it.They own banks.”She looked up at me. I could feel her body reaching out to be touched.“You’re no better than a whore.”“But a rich whore. Not a cheap whore.”“Know what I do to whores, Gwen?”“What?” she sighed dreamily.“I fuck ‘em.”She lifted her face and willed me to kiss her. Opened her mouth in expectation.I smelled the alcoholic fumes as I bent to her need. Her lips were slick withoily paint. I slid my tongue between her teeth. She closed her eyes and pressedher softness against me. My hands dropped to her hips, seized them; I rocked hergently. My tongue probed inside her sour mouth. I could feel the heat of herbreasts through her bra and my shirt. The alcohol fueled her wantonness,increased her awareness and sensuality. I brushed my fingers down the front ofher blouse unfastening buttons. She pressed her cunt against me, felt the thickmasculinity against her loins. She rocked her hips back and forth in boldinvitation, her shamelessness quickening her desire and setting her on fire withlust. “Oh yes!” she whimpered.Strip me! Strip me naked!”She was asking for it now. I pulled the filmy silk blouse from her shoulders,unfastened her skirt and slid it down over the warm mounds of her buttocks. Shekicked it aside with a little giggle. I ran my fingers through her silky blondehair and smiled at how it gleamed in the moonlight.“You’re a wonderful lover,” she panted.“Better than Bobby?”“Bobby’s a lump of silly putty compared to you.” She placed her hand on my faceand gazed into my eyes. “You’re so much more than I had hoped for.”“Your fantasy?”“Oh yes!”She reached for my boner. Ran her hand over the heated curved scimitar encasedin my jeans.“You’ve got a big one!”“You like that big hard dick?”“Yes!” she moaned, “I’m getting wet.”“Wet where?” I teased.“Down there.”“Say it, Bitch!”“Wet in my cunt!”“You’re a whore.”“I want it. Please! Do it to me.”I brushed my lips across the swell of her haltered breasts, felt her nippleserect beneath the cups of her brassiere. I let her feel my mouth hot on herbelly, in her navel, sliding down toward her pulsing liquid center. She moanedher willingness, opening her thighs with unmistakable invitation. I played mytongue just above the waistband of her bikini briefs, teasing her and beingrewarded with a passion-laden mewl of disappointment as I straightened andpressed my turgid heat into her belly through the denim of my jeans.She opened her eyes. Stared at me curiously, probably wondering why I couldn’tbring myself to put my mouth over the stinking buttery slime seeping through herpanties, slickening the insides of her thighs. “Lick me! Eat my pussy, Lover!”she begged, naming the perversion she longed for.Before I could respond, she closed her eyes and pulled my head down to hermouth. She thrust her tongue hungrily between my saliva-slippery lips. I couldfeel the racing beat of her heart thumping just above her right breast. Shemoaned as a wave of passion overwhelmed her; her body shivered with the onset ofher first orgasm. She clawed at my zipper. Nothing else seemed to matter to her.She reached into my trousers and wrapped her right hand around my penis,squealing her delight and panting, “Yes! Yes! Yes!” as with her left hand shetore at her panties in an effort to strip them from her own ass. Her wantondepravity was out of control. She’d become an animal in the mindless throes ofsexual lust, a regular bitch in heat.Quickly, I ran my left hand up the length of her knobby spine, pulled hertrembling body toward me in a close embrace; then I laid the cold blade againsther belly and pushed it into her with irreversible finality and deadly intent.I levered the knife deep into her gut and clamped my hand over her mouth tostifle the scream that bubbled up from her suddenly-violated body. The pain toreher apart, overloading her senses. She tried again to scream, but I kept my handgripped considerately over her mouth. She opened her eyes and fixed me with anintense and questioning stare. I smiled at her, wondering how her head wouldlook on a stick. I punched the shank deeper into her bowels. Her body jerked inan involuntary orgasmic climax. I was glad it was good for her. It was good forme too. She reflexively squeezed my penis and I came in her hand.I watched her eyes drop to the shaft of steel buried in her belly, just abovethe crest of her pubic triangle. She watched my hand as I pulled the blade upand across, neatly gutting her. She stared with wide-eyed fascination as theropy coils of her own intestines slid out of her belly and hung to her knees.Her eyes were filled with disbelief. Her terror must have blocked off the pain.I angled the cutting edge up under her rib cage and lanced it into her heart.The green eyes rolled back in her head, becoming white marbles.I could feel the blood coming up, filling her mouth, hot and sticky behind myhand. I pulled her head back away from my face; saw the mouth pout in a smallsoundless puckered “O” as I jerked the knife free from her belly. A fountain ofblood erupted, spurting darkly over the pine needles.The bitch gasped, a raw sucking sound. I’d heard it before, recognized itsimplications. She turned around and grasped the palm, hugging it to her like alover; then she made an obscene throaty gurgle and the blood and vomit spewedfrom her mouth and nostrils. She choked and collapsed to her knees, then floppedonto her back. Through the rustling branches of the Australian pines she couldcatch the glimmer of sparkling stars strewn across the inky vault of the nightsky. She called for her Bobby once, softly, hiccuped and slid away into death. Iwas heartened. It was a satisfying and skillful kill.I peered into her lusterless eyes. She was undeniably dead. I wiped the heavyknife clean on her skirt and slipped the war surplus bayonet back into thesheath in my Dingo boot. I noticed her purse, a small clutch. I opened it.Tissues, lipstick, a sheaf of hundred dollar bills, feminine odds and ends andtwo student ID cards. One for Miss Gwen, and the other for Mr. Robert PurcellAshford, the elusive Bobby. As I pocketed the bills, an idea was born: I tuggeddown Gwen’s blood-spattered, sex-sodden panties, wadded them into a ball, andtossed them onto the pine straw. I dragged her disemboweled corpse across theseawall, leaving a wide spoor of greasy blood. I rolled it into the cleansingwarm waters of the Intracoastal Waterway. Gwen’s other clothing and purse joinedher in the water. Then I dropped Bobby’s student ID near the bloody panties, andwalked from the park.Killing is thirsty work. I headed towards Lum’s for a schooner of beer,confident that the Fort Lauderdale Police Department would be able to solve themystery of the murderous lover’s quarrel.CUT BAITThe best place to catch big sharks is at the end of the North Jetty where thehuge black end of granite boulders abut the Port Everglades ships channels.They were barged down from Maine long ago and laid in the sea to protect thedeepwater passage from the southerly drift of fine sand.Twice each day the outflowing tide carries the garbage of the harbor throughthis narrow cut, out into the sea.image [Images/84.jpg]That’s when the sharks feed.There’s also a best time to catch these sharks. The half hour period of twilightwhen the tide is running hard and the waxing moon hangs fat on the Easternhorizon, that’s the very best time of all. The dark thirty, the time oftransition. That’s when the big ones come seeking blood.It’s a long hike from the Bahia Mar parking lot to the North Jetty. I have a lotof stuff to carry: tackle box, sturdy rod, knife. Walk a full mile in soft sand,with the long weighty nylon rope looped over my shoulders. It’s tiring.Irritating. Noisome little shitassed kids screeching at my ankles. “Whatchadoing, Mister?” Sniggering near-naked beach sluts in bikinis making with theireyes. Fuck ‘em. What would they know about feeding the sharks?Down by the jetty it’s all wonderful and perfect. The charter boats are comingin, an entire armada of million-dollar sailboats and yachts festooned with youngflesh. The pretty sailorettes waving from the sun decks, hair tousled and flyingin the warm, salty breeze. I wave. Smile. Fucking rich bitch whores. I wend myway out toward the end of the jetty, carefully picking my way over the wetrocks.Overhead the gulls are wheeling, screaming, diving on the bait fish flashinglike silver coins skipped across the surface of the sea. I inhale the richmarine smells: dead fish, rotting seaweed, putrid sewage flushed from the fancyyachts. A bloated cat sails by on the tide, bobbing along on the gentle swell.Bait. I sit on the rocks listening to the busily clicking claws of the crabs,the splash of leaping fish, the sibilant unhurried breathing of the deep, and Iwatch Nature’s curtain descend on another day. So peaceful.The voices are young, full of laughter. They grate like a rasp against thepleasant hiss and suck of the waters playing over the rocks at my feet. Girlvoices.“Karen? Be careful you don’t fall—these rocks are slippery!”There’s a tinkling giggle. The Karen creature calls back. “C’mon, let’s go allthe way out to the end!”Karen, a regular Little Miss High Adventure, comes bounding gracefully over thehuge dark stones, her less-agile companion bringing up the rear.Finally she sees me seated in the shadows.“Hi!” she says, “What’re you doing out here?”Nosy little bitch.I smile a welcome. “Collecting bait is what I’m doing. I’m going fishing.”The two of them look at the tackle box, the pole laying on the rock at my side.They giggle and look back and forth at each other, passing secret femalesignals. Sluts.“What are you two doing?”Saucy Karen says, “We’re looking for a nice place to smoke a few joints. Do youmind if we sit out here? This is a really peaceful spot, isn’t it?”Doper sluts.I shrug. “I don’t care. Free country.”They hop down onto the big flat rock where I’m sitting.“Hey, you wanna get high with us?” Karen wants to know.“Maybe. Anybody coming up with you back there who might want to bust us?”They both chuckle up a little laugh. Probably already half wrecked on something.“Nobody even on the beach. They’re all home eating dinner,” they titter.What the hell is so funny? Dinner?I stand up and take a long hard look. Eyes flickering over the ebony stones,down the length of the jetty and across the empty strand. Nobody. The tide’srunning fast, water inky, vestiges of blood-red sky in the west, bulbous orangemoon on the rise. Shrimp popping in the hissing eddies. Bait.“Bad moon on the rise,” I say. It’s the truth.The Karen doper is peering into her little satchel of sweet dreams angling forher stash, her braless friend standing there in mute anticipation like somevapid cow. Brainless cunt.I take the Colt Woodsman from the waistband of my khaki trousers. A flash.Sharp crack of sound. Small dark hole appears between her bovine teats. Bralessgoes “Oh!”Drops to her knees and flops forward onto her face with a meaty thud.Karen looks up from her stash bag. Goes “Wha?” as a .22 caliber hollow-pointpunches through her right eyeball into her brain. She collapses in a heap, armsand legs twitching and jerking in spasms.“Good shot, Sherlock,” I comment to the night.Braless is stretched out, nose mashed to the stone. I roll her over on her back.Neat little hole in the bosom-stuffed T-shirt, a small circle of blood. Heartshot. Stopped her ticker cold. Shut down the pump. Pull out the fish knife, cutoff the shirt. Unfasten her jeans, pull ‘em down. Panties. T-Shirt. Sandals.Wrap it all up and fling it into the sea. Drag her naked corpse to the edge ofthe flat rock. Open up her neck with one quick cut and leave her to dribble asanguine stream of warm blood into the pulsing tide. A human spoor that willbring the sharks to the rocks. Bloodfeast.Karen’s still twitching, her hands opening and closing. Fingers moving. Legswrithing in slow motion. Shutting down the systems. Overloading the circuits.Exploded eyeball all over her cheek, a bloody gel. Remaining eye rolled uptoward the ascending moon. Sightless accusing eye. Dirty little dope-suckingslut. If thine eye offends thee, pluck it out. Yes, that’s what the Preachermansaid: Pluck it out!Small sharks already circling. Moonbeams sparkling on the water, little beads ofphosphorescence where the baby jaws break the surface. Hunting blood. Meat.Eyeballs. Oh Yes. Yes! Pluck it OUT! I slide the needle point of the blade intothe corner of the eye socket. Pluck it out with ease. Flip it onto the placidswell. It floats for a few seconds, then gone with a swirl.image [Images/86.jpg]Yank open the primly buttoned blouse. Slice through the bra strap, peel it away.Vanilla ice cream boobs crowned with cherry nipples. Double scoops. Carve offthe cherry. Flip it in the water. Silver flash! Big oceanic jacks. Chum ‘em up.Carve off the other cherry. Give it a flick. The quiet surface bursts insparkling phosphor spray. Lovely. They’re coming now. The feeding begins. Chum‘em up!Off come the tar-stained tennis shoes. Pull down the sodden, pissy-smellingjeans, rip away the wet panty. Consign it to the sea. All of it. Little whitestring in the damp pubic hair disappearing up her cunt. Pluck it OUT! Sling thebloody tampon onto the water. A splash, a swirl, and it’s gone. Oh, how theylove the blood! Give them BLOOD!I pick up the knife, ram it up the cunt. Twist the blade, turn it, core herhole. Glop and gore splooshes out, spills over the rock and trickles into thewater. I thrust the blade into her navel, turning the razor-sharp blade to diceher guts. I rip it up to her breastbone, slash it down to her pubic mound;listen to the gurgle of blood sloshing in her body cavity, mingling with theremains of her lunch. I hook out a length of ropy gray intestine. Cut a bloodysection of greasy gut and toss it seaward. The calm surface erupts in a fountainof spray. Mako!I tie the long nylon rope around her neck; throw her gutted corpse out into thecurrent. Pay out the line. A huge bull shark comes to the surface with the baitin its jaws, shaking it like a terrier with a rat, ripping it apart withslashing side-to-side motions. The line goes slack. Shit! Bait’s gone!I turn to the bleeding chum bag splayed across the black granite. At least 120pounds of bloody meat and offal. I rake my blade down the satin-skinned back,flaying white flesh. Flip her over. Push the knife into her belly, open her up.Sit her up and the viscera slops out into her lap. I loop the line around hermiddle and pitch the bait into the tidal race. A half-dozen curved dorsal finscleave the surface. Hammerhead!They plunge at the bait bouncing it across the water in a bizarre ballet ofripping and tearing flesh. Almost instantly the line is slack once again. I haulit in. Bitten through!Fuckers stole the damn bait! The surface of the inlet boils in a frothy frenzyof feeding sharks. A wonder of nature. A sight to behold. I see the scimitarfins of half a hundred sharks cutting the smooth surface, slicing back and forthacross the oily flow of the outgoing tide, seeking the blood source.All gone, little shark children, all gone.Bait’s gone.A rusty freighter oozes out of Port Everglades on the tide, the soft chuff-chuffof its engines thrumming across the quiet water, deckhands visible along therails going about their sailor’s business in the moonlight. Honk of a nightheron as the evening cools. The flat smack of mullet leaping. Southwind. Moonhigh. Stars sprayed across the sky from horizon to horizon.I lay on the flat black rock and peer into the celestial vault. Time to go back.Make the long trek to Bahia Mar over the shadows in the sand, still warm fromthe sun. Ghost crabs scuttle. Lights winking along A1 A. Squealing rubber oncement. Throbbing boom boxes.The police. Two big porkers leaning on my car smoking. How could they know? Iwalk up, too weary to care. They eye my equipment.Fat cop says, “Any luck tonight?”“None at all,” I reply, putting my stuff into the trunk.“Wha’d you use?” he asks.“Cut bait,” I answer, as I slide behind the wheel and fire up the ignition.WHORESWhores. You know how they are. All they want is money and a big, stiff dick upthe hole, but mostly the money.I’d been told that women didn’t like sex, that somehow you had to trick theminto it, but later I found out that wasn’t true at all. We’d discuss it. Goodgirls versus nice girls, but what it actually came down to was virgins andwhores.One Saturday I was down at Clark’s News, thumbing through the latest issue ofWestern Adventure magazine. I turned a page, and there before me hanging fromthe limb of an old oak tree was Ella Watson. The caption beneath the picturetold me that Miss Watson was a whore, and she was hanged for her crimes. Iwondered what her crimes might have been. She stared at me from the page, eyesopen and tongue stuck out. She was shown with her legs kicking. You could seealmost all the way up to the top where the you-know-what is. It was revealingand sexy, and it made my dick hard. I bought the magazine, took it home and thatnight I lay in bed and learned the story of Cattle Kate.Kate was a pretty whore. She gave men sex and took their money. She opened awhorehouse out in Wyoming and accepted stolen cattle for her sex fee. She got anice big herd that way. The local people, who were all decent and God-fearinglike myself, told her to pack up and get out of the territory. She didn’t leave,so they took her out and hanged her from a tree. The idea was to clean up thecommunity.Whores attract the criminal element, it said in the magazine. The whorespoisoned the well of community decency. It was the sort of thing that makes acivic-minded young man do some hard thinking.Pick any day you please and there were lamentations in the local newspaperconcerning the decline of community morals. Sex-mad college girls invaded FortLauderdale every spring looking for those stiff dicks and that money. Used to beyou could drive down to the beach and have a real pleasant day, but the beacharea was getting to be a slum, and any time you cared to go down there and look,you could see an abundance of whores. Whole coveys of them walking the streets,looking for men to corrupt. They sure did seem to like that beachfront area.They circulated in all the bars down there hunting their unsuspecting victims,turning this town into a modern Sodom. I decided to do something about it.I got dressed up in my best Madras walking shorts, a polo shirt with a littlealligator on the pocket, and my new Weejuns. I put some money in my pocket anddrove down to Lauderdale Beach to a little joint on Al A. I used my Hanley B.Poole fake ID to order me some beer. I sipped at it while I looked around. Itwasn’t five minutes before a whore came sliding along to seduce me. I figuredI’d let her, and then I’d get her.She cruised right up to the booth where I was sitting in the shadows and askedif she could join me. She was wearing white pedal pushers and a pink shell topwith a scoop neck that was cut so low that when she leaned over, I could seeright down inside where there was a white brassiere covering her teats. She hadtacky plastic sandals on her feet, but it was the boobs that had my interest. Itwas making me hot to see those titties down in there, and she knew it; that’swhy she was showing them off to me.She sat down across from me and right away she wanted a beer, so I ordered herone. I listened to her story about coming down to Florida from Cleveland, Ohio,to seek her fame and fortune. She claimed to be a model and an actress waitingfor her big break. I didn’t want to spoil her fun by telling her there was notmuch chance of a Hollywood audition at the Bikini Lounge. She was entitled toher fantasy. I had one of my own. I told her my daddy was a rich orange groveowner, that I went to Amherst, and that I was just down on the beach looking forgirls. My line sounded at least as good as hers, I figured.She jumped right on it, like a frog on a bug. She whispered over at me in aconfidential manner that she’d “mess around” with me if I’d give her fiftydollars. I told her I’d give her a twenty dollar bill if she’d take down herpanties and let me put it up her hole. She made a face like maybe I was somecheapskate Jew, but said that twenty would be OK. We left the bar and crossed AlA to where my green Ford station wagon was parked. I opened the door for her,she slid into the front seat, and soon we were on our way.It was a warm sunny day and as we headed west on Sunrise, I told the whore thetragic tale of Cattle Kate. I said it was lousy how people reacted to messingaround back in the old days and that the story would make a great movie. Sheagreed. I proposed that Sandra Dee would be a good actress for the part of Kate,or maybe, with luck, she herself could get the part, since she was so much cuterthan Sandra Dee. She preened over that compliment and asked me if I reallythought she could get it, or was I just making talk. I told her I really thoughtshe would make a perfect Kate.We headed out State Road 84 and turned left at Davie Road. I took her to theairstrip, out where they built the college later. There was an abandoned garageback there, left over from World War II. It was a sturdy old concrete blockbuilding with a cement floor. The area was entirely shaded by huge Australianpine trees. At night it was something of a lover’s lane, but in the daytime itwas deserted.I rolled the wagon down the pine needle carpeted dirt driveway, pulled up infront of the garage and parked. I told the whore that my daddy owned the landand the adjacent citrus groves. She was impressed. I commented that we couldmess around right there in the car. It would be real private. Nobody would becoming around. She scooched right across the front seat, snuggled up to me andwe started kissing and feeling each other up. She got me hot fast by stickingher tongue in my mouth and moving it around, then she was frenching my ear. Itwas damn nice. But all of a sudden she backed off and asked me for money.She said if I’d give her the money she’d take down her pants and let me put itup her hole. I took out my wallet and passed her a twenty. She tucked it downinto her straw pocket book. I noticed it had Souvenir of Parrot Jungle woveninto the straw. I was going to ask her if she liked the tricks the parrots did,but instead I told her I’d give her another ten if she’d model like Cattle Katefor me. She said she would, so I gave her the ten-spot and watched it join thetwenty in the parrot bag.We got out of the car and I fetched a line of rope from the carry-all section ofthe station wagon. I leaned against the front bumper and fashioned the line intoa hangman’s noose while she watched. She’d picked a wild daisy and was twirlingit in her fingers, picking it apart petal by petal and chanting as she droppedeach piece, “He loves me, he loves me not.” She finished up on “he loves me not”and shot me a crooked smile. “Bad luck in love.”“Ah, you don’t believe in bad luck, do you? Come on over here, Kate!”I tossed the noose up over the heavy beam at the front of the garage where atone time engines were raised from the bodies of cars. I widened the loop andplaced it over her head. She fiddled with her long ponytail while I adjusted thecoil around her neck. I set the knot behind her ear just like the picture in themagazine. I asked her if it was too tight. She said it wasn’t tight at all. ThenI tied her wrists behind her with green nylon twine, and arranged her ankles thesame way: took a few turns around them and made a nice firm knot. I moved a fewsteps back, put my hands on my hips, and told her she made a perfect CattleKate.She smiled, stuck out her tongue and crossed her eyes. I told her to hold thatpose, and I’d take a picture of her and mail it to Otto Preminger in Hollywoodwith a movie suggestion. She thought that was a great idea. I told her I’d getthe camera from the glove compartment, turned and picked up the loose end of therope and tied it to the car bumper. I slid behind the wheel, cranked up theignition, put the car in reverse and backed up.The whore rose right up in the air and once again stuck out her tongue. It wascomical the way it popped right out of her mouth, all wet and pink. Her eyeswere wide open and staring right at me. Her expression was fascinating. Her faceturned pink, then red, then blue—a pleasant lavender-blue. Her body quivered andshimmied; as she turned blue she wet her pants. A dark stain materialized at thejuncture of her thighs, then quickly slid down the legs of her pedal pushers.The pee streamed down over her calves and dribbled from her toes making a puddleon the concrete floor under her. The pretty face turned purple, her bodyshivered violently; then she went limp. It was interesting to watch.I got out of the car with the camera and took some pictures, used up the entireroll of film. Different angles back and front. I wanted to record it all forfuture reference. When I finished taking pictures, I got back into the idlingcar and put the machine in forward. The whore came straight down and stood inthe center of the puddle she’d made. I shut off the ignition, got myself out andwalked over to her and said, “Hey Kate, I think you got the part!”Her tongue was still hanging out and she smelled sort of yukky, like a loadeddiaper. I wasn’t sure if she was dead or just passed out. The purple was gonefrom her face. It was a funny grayish-white color—didn’t look too healthy to me.A small trickle of blood was sliding out of her left nostril. I took someKleenex out of my pocket and dabbed at the blood and then stuck a plug of tissuein her nose. I was expecting her to say something but she was keeping quiet.I ran my hands over her plump young breasts and shook her slightly. “Well?Aren’t you excited?” Still no answer, so I lifted up the pink shell top. Thewhite cotton cups of her bra were chock-full of titty. Whore titty, full andwhite. There was a nipple in there too. The size of a large pea and set in thecenter of a ring of peachy puckered skin the size of a quarter. I put my fingeron the nipple and wiggled it. It felt rubbery. I licked my finger and tried itagain. Real honest-to-god whore titty. I’d never seen one up close. I licked thenipple. It really had no special taste at all, just a little salty sweat. Therewasn’t anything else to do so I rearranged her bra the way it had been andpulled down her shell.I gave Kate a chaste kiss on the cheek and sang to her softly, “Wake up, wakeup, my little Sleeping Beauty,” but she didn’t wake up and she didn’t move. Shewas still standing there in the puddle of pee with her tongue sticking out. Ipoked at her tongue with my finger, and then pushed it back into her mouth. Iwondered if she could really be dead. We’d only been playing Cattle Kate for afew minutes, maybe five or ten at the very most. How could she be dead thatfast? She took the ten dollars to model the pose for me. I’d told her the storyfirst.It wasn’t really my fault.“OK, Kate, quit your acting or I’m gonna take back my twenty dollars.” Shehadn’t messed around with me for the twenty like she had promised. I was waitingfor her to pull down her panties so I could stick it in her hole. Kate wasn’tbreathing. Maybe she was in a coma. Hard to tell, really.I took out my Barlow pocket knife and opened up the blade, reached down andsliced through the cord tied around her ankles; then I put it away andunbuttoned her pedal pushers and pulled them down and off. She was wearing awhite mesh panty, one-size-fits-all kind. I could see her pubic hair inside it.The seat of the panty was poked out in the back from a turd like a browncorncob. I drew down the panty over her well-rounded bottom and the turd fellout on the floor. That solved the problem of the nasty smell coming from backthere. I looked at her bare bottom and could see there was a pussy there too. Icould see it from the rear. It was covered with wet brown hair, but I knew thatwas the place where you stick it in. I touched it with my finger. It was slickand gooey between her legs. Strange. I removed my finger and smelled it. Fish. Ipulled down the underpants and put them over the turd. I used her pedal pushersto soak up the puddle of pee, then I scooped it all up and threw it into acorner in the garage.The hair on the front of her pussy was thick and brown, a thin line of itrunning up toward her belly button. I’d been expecting a neat vee-shape like Ihad seen in Playboy, but Kate’s pubic area was tangled and unkempt. I could justmake out the indentation of her female crease under the hair. The crack vanishedbetween her legs. I opened the thighs a bit with my hands. I wanted to see itall. I took a good long look. It was the first whore’s cunt I’d seen up close ona sunshiny afternoon. It looked exactly like a sodden brown rat.I stripped off my walking shorts and underpants. I went around behind her andpositioned the head of my boner against the little hole. I gave a small thrustand it went right on up inside her. The feeling was fantastic: warm, moist andslick as lotion. I stuck it up as far as I could and ejaculated. Then I pulledit out and put my clothes back on. It was just a quickie but it was nice andworth the money.The whore hadn’t moved at all. I took off the noose and helped her over to thecar and let her sit on the front seat. I left her wrists tied in case shesuddenly woke up. She’d be angry about her pedal pushers, but I wasn’t about totake those nasty things in the car with us. She’d been paid, so she had nocomplaint there.But you know how whores are, you just can’t trust them.I drove her to a rockpit in the center of a nearby orange grove. She sat quietlyslumped against the door. Anyone would think she was napping. When we got to thepit I took my SCUBA equipment from the carry-all section and put it on, then Ihelped her out of the car and we went for a swim. She needed a good wash anyway.I took her down to twenty feet. There on the bottom was a car I had borrowedfrom somebody who’d left the keys in the ignition. Took it right out of theparking lot in front of the Grandway Store at Broward and State Road Seven. Iopened the door on the sunken sedan and we got in. I put her behind the wheel.She was easy to manage underwater. I tied her right foot to the gas pedal, andher left foot to the brake. I untied her wrists from behind her and bound themto the steering wheel.There she sat, with her lush ponytail swirling around her head. She sure wasn’tgoing to get away from this one. I rolled the windows halfway up to make sure.She looked real cute behind the wheel. A pretty girl in a nice new car peeringthrough the windshield at the bluegills swimming past. I opened the door andswam out. Closed it, flippered around to the front and watched Kate sittingthere. Finally, after a time, I waved goodbye to her and headed for the surface.I used that rockpit for many years. It was particularly good because it was fullof blue claw crabs.It was about sixty days after I’d hung that whore in the garage that I decidedI’d go see how she was doing. I drove on out there and made the dive. When Iswam up to the windshield and looked in I got quite a shock, because I thoughtshe was gone! But as I swam in for a closer look, I could see she was a pile ofbones on the front seat and the floor of the sedan. Picked perfectly clean,there was no flesh to be seen. Her plastic sandals were there, along with partof her top and brassiere. The ponytail was resting on the back seat still in aplastic hairclip, but there was no meat. It was a puzzle. Later I caught them:the blueclaw crabs were cleaning up the last few shreds of flesh stuck in herhair.She’d been a whore with painted lips. We had played a game, and then she wentdown under the water and took a ride in my car. Forever."},{"pageContent":"DETECTIVE DAN KELLY: ROGUE COPTHE SEX BEAST CAPERThe sixteen-year-old girl looked like she might break down in tears at anymoment.She was sitting on the edge of a hardwood chair in my penthouse apartment on thesixteenth floor of the Everglades Towers Condominium. Her soft brown eyes weremoist and pleading. She kept licking her lips, wringing her hands and crossingthen uncrossing her legs.I gave her a hard look and told her, “Last chance to tell the truth, littlesister, run it by me one more time.”“I swear, officer, I’m innocent.”“You don’t need to convince me, honey. It’s those twelve jurors and that hangingjudge you need to worry about. And when it comes right down to it, who will theybelieve? The state’s attorney and the police? Or a suspected killer?”The girl buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders shook with sobs. “What willthey do to me?”“A young woman your age…a charge of aggravated felony murder…I’d bet onexecution in the state electric chair.”“Oh my God! Oh my GOD! NO!”“Hey. Don’t worry, they won’t fry you until you turn eighteen. Couple of yearson Death Row, then the Big Sizzle. Lots of girls on Death Row these days. You’llhave plenty of company.”“But I didn’t DO it!”“Nobody wants to hear that, girlie, get used to it. But maybe we can cut you adeal…”She looked puzzled. “What do you mean a deal?”“What I mean is you make my job easy by confessing to this caper and I’llarrange it so you don’t get electrocuted for murder. Not only that but you canlive here with me in this fancy condo and learn the callgirl trade. Makeyourself a nice pile of money.” She wasn’t convinced. “I’ll run you out toSurfside Six and introduce you to Don Johnson personally. Maybe line you up witha part in his show. You’ve got the looks for it. You’d like that?”The girl stared wide-eyed. “You can introduce me to Don Johnson?”“Sure. Tomorrow afternoon if you want.”“Oh, yes! I want to meet him!”“OK, then we have a deal. Just say ‘yes’ when I nod my head.” I activated thelittle Sony in my jacket pocket and said, “You freely admit to the robbery andmurder of Rebecca Stein?” I gave the nod.“Yes,” she answered dutifully. I read her Miranda and then ran through the wholecrime. She answered at every nod of my head with the correct response. When Ihad what I wanted I clicked off the tape and sat down on the bed.“Show me your cunt now, sweetie.”The kid looked like I’d slapped her across the chops. Turned beet red.“C’mon, stand up and peel down those Calvins. Don’t keep Daddy Dan waiting.”“I think I’ve changed my mind,” she whispered, her eyes huge.I hooked the little tape player out of my pocket and turned it on. She listened,sobbing quietly while the confession ran its course. When the litany ofmurderous acts was finished, the girl said with cool contempt, “You’re a realbastard.”I rewarded her with a wicked openhanded slap that spun her off the chair ontothe floor. “Thou shalt not be disrespectful to thy Master. That’s Rule NumberOne. Now can you remember that, bitch, or do you need a few more taps on thesnoot?”The girl shook her head to get her senses back. A pretty toss of the chestnuttresses. It would be a real shame to see that lovely mane scissored off on thefloor of the Death House at Starke. The teen was a beauty, wholesome and fit.Only time would tell if she was smart enough to face up to the reality of hersituation.“Welcome to Miami,” I said with a smile and held out my hand to help her up. Shetook my hand. A good sign. She rubbed at her cheek. It would be bruised, but shewouldn’t be going out on the town just yet. She got right to the point when sheasked, “Are you gonna fuck me now?”I ran my hard hand over her dirty hair. She needed a bath in the worst way.“What’s your real name, girl?” She hesitated.I spoke softly and gently. “Honey, if you lie to me even one time you will fryin your own juices. This tape guarantees that, doesn’t it?”She nodded glumly. “My name is Crystal Koenig. I’m from Keokuk, Iowa. I justturned sixteen last week…and I don’t want to go to jail. I don’t want to die.Please, mister…““Call me Dan. Daddy Dan.” She seem confused at my genial tone and that was fine.“On your way to see Don Johnson, were you?”“That was my plan.”“We get about 200 girls a week like you. The jail is chock full of them. You arunaway? A throwaway? Mommy and Daddy hunting you down somewhere?”“I took off when I turned sixteen. That’s the legal age for girls in Iowa. Mymom says I have movie-star looks. So I figured I’d try to make it in Miami.Looks like I screwed up before I even got a chance for my first audition.” Shewiped her nose with the back of her hand. “What are you gonna do to me? Rape me?Kill me?”“Before we get into rape and murder, how would you like a Diet Pepsi? Maybe asandwich to go with it? How’s pastrami and Swiss on rye sound?”She smiled a little. “So I get fed before being raped and murdered?”“Sure. Condemned ladies all get that last meal. It’s a regular tradition. You’veseen that on TV, haven’t you?”She nodded. No use telling her condemned ladies don’t much care for any finelast meals and those that do just puke them up when they get to the main event.We walked into the kitchen together. I handed her a Kosher dill pickle, and gotbusy. I observed her style as she was slurping at the pickle, while I slappedtogether a sandwich with a half-inch of thin-sliced pastrami, some Swiss cheeseand a thick slather of mustard. Then I passed her a cold Diet Pepsi, and satdown to watch her wolf down the pastrami. She was a big healthy girl with ahearty appetite. As I sucked on a Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, I wondered what otherhearty appetites she might have. She smacked her lips and licked her fingers.She’d need lessons in how to be a lady. “Come off a farm, did you?”She grinned. “How’d you guess?”“You eat like an animal and you smell like pig shit.”She blinked, looked abashed, then smiled. “I probably do smell awful. We raisedhogs. I tended them. Can I take a shower here?”“This is your new home, kid. Permanently. First things first. We’re gonna startwith a quick shower with a brush to get the pig manure out from between yourtoes, then we’ll give you an herbal soak in a nice hot whirlpool bath, thenwe’ll wash out your hair with some designer shampoo and then you can give it ahot oil treatment while you sit in the sauna.”“What’s a sauna?”“You’ll see. If you’re a good girl you’ll have a nice life here with Daddy Dan.Get out of line, you get beat. Cross me, you die. Easy rules in this lockup.Just think of yourself as my slave.”“I ought to be good at that. Since my daddy’s been gone, that’s just about allI’ve been anyway.”“What happened to your daddy?”“Nobody knows for sure. Folks say he got et up by the hogs. He used to drink hisown moonshine and get pretty whacked. One night he was drinking out by the penand I guess he just went to sleep. In the morning when I went to slop the hogs,all I saw was his railroad hat and the studs from his overalls.”“Maybe he took off.”“Yeah, maybe he did. I’d kind of rather think he wound up back in West Virginiaor somewheres instead of on our dinner table mixed in with the pork chops.”She pushed down on an errant bit of pastrami left on the Spode plate, and lickedthe tidbit off her fingertip, an unconsciously erotic gesture. “What’s all thatstuff you said about callgirls?”“I’ll have you trained by a pro. Nurse Nancy will have to check you out beforeI’ll touch you. It’s not a bad life. Plenty of flash and cash. You like sex?”She pondered it awhile. “No. I don’t like it.”“Ever tried it?”“I’m not a virgin.”“How many guys you been to bed with?”“Just one. Arvin.” She lowered her eyes and swallowed.“Uh-huh. And who was that, the boy next door?”She hesitated, then said with a little twist of her mouth, “He’s my step-daddy.”She didn’t have to say another thing. That told the whole story right there. Istudied her for a moment, watching the memories bring tears to her eyes.“And that’s all? Just Arvin?”She nodded hopelessly as the tears slowly rolled down her cheeks. She waswinding her napkin around and around into a twisted wad. I took it from her.Crystal was going to need a little TLC. She was riding a bummer: no money, noclothes, no rosy future on the horizon. And coming from nothing but Arvin andmoonshine and a pigpen. She was a beauty and her potential was first-rate. Shedidn’t need another kick in the gut, so I gave her shoulder a gentle squeeze andtold her to follow me. “That Arvin’s last name—Koenig?” I asked her on the wayto the bathroom suite.“Yeah, my mama made me change my name to go with hers.”“Well, we’re gonna forget all about Arvin Koenig, just like he never happened.From now on you’re Crystal Beavers, and you’re gonna be my number one virgin sexslave.” Oakland Park, Florida is an urban slum area in Broward County. With theexception of a small enclave of expensive homes abutting the IntracoastalWaterway on the eastern fringe of the municipality, Oakland Park is a weirdo’swonderland of massage parlors, porno book stores, XXX-rated film rentalbusinesses and seedy whorehouses catering to the blue-collar tourist trade. Thepermanent residents of Oakland Park are tolerant. Taxes are low. The citycoffers are kept full by the vigilant municipal police officers who man theever-present radar speed traps, the rat packs of scribbling meter maids whohaunt the curbsides and gutters, and the Vice Squad cops who, in league withtheir political cronies, operate the revolving door of criminal justice thatkeeps the 500 dollar fines rolling in, day after day, compliments of OaklandPark’s battalion of streetcorner hookers. The Oakland Park political scenestinks worse than the Paris sewers, but the cash flow is first-rate. And so issome of the local pussy.Jolie was an Oakland Park girl, born and bred. Happiness was a pipe-full ofcrack in her head and a hard cock throbbing up her ass. This fine day she waspromised both, compliments of her social studies teacher from the local adulteducation center, who assured the failing Jolie that with a little privatetutoring her grades would surely rise to passing, even exceptional levels. Thelessons would start with the cock and finish with the rock. Jolie, who at 16 wastoo young to drive, pedaled west on her ten-speed. She pumped her way alongOakland Park Blvd. over the bridge and toward the copse of Florida holly treeswhere her nice teacher, Kevin Goodleigh, nervously awaited her with a solidhard-on poking out his pants.Wheeling her bike along the dirt path, Jolie was pleased to see Mr. Goodleighwaiting near the little trail that led into the bushes. He took her hand and ledher to a secluded glade, and hastily pulled off his sweatshirt. Jolie, wastingno time, shucked off her T-shirt. Mr. Goodleigh spread his sweatshirt over acypress log and sat down on it. He pulled the smirking student trollop overtoward him. Jolie boldly unsnapped her brassiere and tossed it aside, leanedforward and let him lick her sweaty teats. She allowed him to suckle thensmiling, she pushed his head lower down against her soft, white belly. Theeducator licked the salt from her navel with deft flicks of his magical tongue.She sighed as she felt the warm tingle of arousal spread through her genitals.Tilting her head back in ecstasy, she let nature take its course beneath thegreen canopy of tropical forest. It was such a nice, secluded, private place forfun and games. Jolie unbuttoned her cycling shorts and slid them down over herfirm, well-rounded bottom, letting them drop to her ankles. Mr. Goodleigh gaspedat the invitation to orally explore the shadowy muff outlined beneath thediaphanous white nylon panty. He buried his face in her thighs. Jolie’sattention focused solely on the pulsing between her legs.Until she heard the snap of a stick. She looked up and saw the figure not sixfeet away. It startled her…but what was it? It looked like a hairy man—could itbe a man in an old fur coat? She squinted at him. He was tall and muscular, andthe long, thick fur was matted with sandspurs, sticktights and cockleburrs. Thehead was conical with a black mane framing the riveting features…deep-setruby-tinted, glowing eyes, a simian nose with an elongated muzzle like a baboon.What was this beast? Her mind writhed, grasping and discarding every animal sheknew of. Then the beast crouched…and her mind went blank. She stiffened as thething silently advanced.Mr. Goodleigh interpreted her speechless reaction as a pre-orgasmic shiver. Hegrasped her sex-sodden panties and pulled them down to her knees.Jolie stumbled backwards as the thing bared his teeth. The oblivious Goodleighmade a lunge towards her, issuing a sexy growl, his eyes fixed on the cleft ofher glistening cunt.The claws came from behind and ripped out Goodleigh’s throat, then twisted offhis head. Jolie watched his decapitated body arch backward, his heels drummingthe soft earth, his still-rigid penis spewing a viscous string of white semen.Some of it sprayed across her face, and she was bringing her hand up to wipe itoff when the beast raked his claws up between the dead man’s legs, shredding hisgenitals and stuffing the mangled flesh into his mouth.Jolie tripped over her shorts as she jumped back. She fell on her butt androlled over to the side as she vomited convulsively. The beast snarled andstepped toward Jolie, reaching out with a deadly quickness. He seized her foot.She jerked her leg away, leaving the monster holding onto her dirty sneaker. Sherolled over onto her hands and knees and tried to get to her feet, but shestumbled over her shorts again. In panic, she tore them off and gained herfoothold, trembling. The beast, a string of gore hanging from his mouth, baredhis fangs at her and growled. Jolie turned and dashed into the thick brush.She knew she had to get back to her ten-speed and the safety of the Boulevard.Thorns raked her naked breasts. Tears stung her scratched cheeks. She sobbed inabject terror. She could hear sounds of life nearby: the swish of rubber onasphalt, the squeal of brakes and honk of horns. And the grunt and hiss ofsomething crashing through the undergrowth behind her: the beast!Jolie felt the furry paw on her shoulder, the hot stinking breath on her neck,the claws sinking into the soft tissue of her shoulder. She opened her mouth andshe screamed and screamed and screamed. She felt the flesh ripping from her armas the beast spun her around and shoved her to the ground. The repulsive musk ofa skunk enveloped her as she felt the blunt knob of an enormous penis pressagainst her sex. She tried to struggle but the beast thrust his weapon into her.She felt her insides rip apart as her organs were violated…and then she knewnothing more. She was dead.The beast followed the levee along the C-14 canal, walking hunched over in ahalf-crouch. He avoided the open areas, staying to the sawgrass and myrtle. Thecreature relived the desperate, cruel pain that drove him to rape and kill againand again. The rage in his head and the rage in his genitals tore at him. Paincontrolled his every instinct.The beast crept up the side of the levee toward the VW bug concealed in thebushes. He stood perfectly still and sniffed the air for signs of danger.Finding no cause for alarm, the beast stood upright, walked to the car andremoved the weighty fur costume, the conical head, the steel claws. The creaturewas refreshed after his rampage. The doctors had told him he was a sex beast.They said he was incurable. He got in his little car and drove away. Two weeks later, Crystal came into the bathroom suite, pulled down her jeans andseated herself on the throne. She’d never even lived in a house with indoorplumbing, much less a bathroom suite. Dan had explained what a suite was, butshe still thought of it as the bathroom sweet. She opened a copy of The Sun, herfavorite tabloid, and peed into the toilet bowl. I was shaving in the vanityarea, and the connecting door to the toilet was ajar.“What’s a skunk ape, Dan?”“Skunk ape? Some big ole hairy monster they say lives out in the Everglades.Sort of a bigfoot. Where’d you hear about the skunk ape in Iowa?”Crystal read slowly and clearly, “Oh, I never heard of it in Iowa. It’s here inThe Sun. There are so many incredible things in this paper! Listen to this: ‘SexBeast Terrorizes Oakland Park.’ It says here that a teenage virgin was savagelyraped and ripped apart while she was on a school field trip. The schoolteacherwas killed too. ‘Jolie Parsons and Kevin Goodleigh were killed by a rutting sexbeast authorities called a skunk ape. The girl was sexually ravished by themonster before being savagely ripped apart by his beastly claws.’ There’s apicture here, an artist’s conception it says. Looks like a conehead in a monkeysuit.”“Does it name the cops involved?”“Mmmmm, let’s see. Yeah, says here Sgt. George Kent, Homicide and Vice, OaklandPark PD.”I laughed. “Biggest liar in a cop shop where lying is a way of life. I’ve knownhim for fifteen years. Gimme that phone there, girl, right next to your cutelittle tushie.”Crystal handed the cordless to me and flushed the toilet as I punched through toKent’s office in Oakland Park. I listened to what he had to say. They werecalling it the “Sex Beast Murders.” It was a serious case, and a skunk ape wasthe prime suspect. I thanked Kent and handed the phone back to Crystal. Sheperched on the counter and looked at me inquiringly.“Seems there could be something to this after all. Kent tells me the girl diedfrom a burst uterus as if a bull’s pizzle had been rammed up in her. Two winosunder the C-14 bridge swear there was a huge skunk ape lurking down by thecanal. They were close enough to smell him. Said he had a pointy head and asnout like a baboon.”“Sounds like that Mad Dog wine got to their brains. That’s a ridiculousstory—isn’t it?”“Kent says the heads were ripped off the bodies of the two victims. Not cut off,like the Butcher does, but ripped right off. With a twist and a jerk. Verycurious M.O., I must say.”“So you think there really is a Sex Beast?”I could discern her need for reassurance. “This is Florida, Kiddo. Anything canhappen. The Sun is a reliable journalistic medium. They can’t print out-and-outlies, you know. They’d get sued. My guess is that skunk apes are on the move.Could be more than one. The glades are drying up all over the state, and theycould be looking for new hidey-holes. There could be big trouble ahead. Nextthing you know a skunk ape will be climbing in a window in the-middle of thenight. Now that he’s got a taste of hot teenage blood, no girl is safe untilSgt. Kent runs him down.”Crystal shivered. “It’s a good thing we’re sixteen floors off the ground! Ican’t believe I slept in the park when I first got here. The sex beast could’vegotten me. I’m lucky to be alive, I guess.”“Yeah, you’re the lucky one all right. Now go fix lunch.” I wiped my face,kissed her on the cheek and smacked her tidy behind. A week later, the headline story in the Weekly World News screamed: “Sex BeastKiller Stalks South Florida.” Crystal was soaking up every word, her Cheeriosabandoned and turning to sodden mush.She tapped a long, scarlet porcelain nail on the drawing of the sex beastleering from the cover and announced, “Look Dan, he got another one. It’s thesame creature that got that girl on the field trip with her teacher.”“No, Crystal, it’s the same case,” I told her.“No way, Jose! This one caught a prom queen starlet and her agent out looking ata site location for a Miami Vice episode.”“Check the names.”She did. “Yeah, you’re right. It’s that Jolie girl, but it says in the News thatshe was an ingenue starlet, scheduled for a role opposite Don Johnson. State’sAttorney Bob Rock says he believes the sex beast has been responsible for thedeaths of twenty girls in Oakland Park alone!”“Is that a fact? I commented dryly. “Sounds like another Schaefer.”“What’s a Schaefer?”“Long story there, Punkin.”“Says Sheriff ‘Hollywood Nick’ Narcissus has called for volunteers to form aposse to hunt down and capture the sex beast. Look, here’s the Sheriff’spicture. He says, ’No woman is safe while the Sex Beast is on the loose. Thismonster must be taken dead or alive!’ Wow.”“Eat your Cheerios, Kid.”“No, listen to this, Dan! Dr. Tim Dinkus, Broward County Medical Examiner,reveals that the starlet’s naked breasts were punctured by fang marks. Could bea vampire, Dan! Or even an alien—like a wookie! Don’t say they’re not around. Iread about them every week.”“Vampires my ass. You’re gonna give yourself nightmares reading that lurid crap.You want to read, then go read something realistic. Something with some sociallyredeeming features. I got to go to work, but there’s a copy of Killer Fiction onthe coffee table. All the cops are reading it. It’s a limited edition, and it’snot easy to get. There was a two-week waiting list at work just to get ahold ofthis copy. I’ve got to pass it on tomorrow, so why don’t you scan it while youhave a chance.”“Any sex in it?”“Lots of sex. Lots of realistic crime scenes, too. Read it and learn.”“OK, Dan, I will,” she agreed, but I could see Crystal was too absorbed in thestory of the Sex Beast to get any benefit from it. I called George Kent from the Station House. “What’s the word on the Sex Beastcase?” I asked him. He was embarrassed to tell me he was making no progress. Iwasn’t surprised. Kent had never solved a murder case in seventeen years on theforce. He was an ace when it came to busting hookers and writing traffictickets. He had a reasonable explanation: felony busts don’t generate income.The Oakland Park PD keeps those high-fine misdemeanors rolling in. Fuck felony,that was Kent’s motto. But he did mention that the Sex Beast was scaring awaytourists, which was bad for the hooker business. I made a suggestion and heliked my idea. After all, he was a desperate man. Crystal took one look at the bloodstained cypress log and frowned deeply.“That’s where we found what was left of Goodleigh, Dan. Seems he’d beenstretching that teen pussy for years. Sucky-fucky in exchange for passinggrades. Seems like we had a rotten apple this time. Most of the child molesterswe bust are schoolteachers. It’s really amazing but statistics don’t lie.”George Kent told it like it was. He turned to Crystal and said, “Are you sureyou want to risk this, Miss Beavers?”“She’s sure,” I said.Crystal Beavers, aspiring starlet and public-spirited citizen, drew off hersweatshirt and unfastened her jeans. She slid them down and stepped out of themalong with her panties. She handed her clothes to me. I spread the sweatshirt onthe log and motioned for Crystal to sit. A short length of chain was fastenedaround her ankle, and the other end wound several times around the cypress log.Crystal sat there gloriously naked and said dispiritedly, “Here, Sex Beastie!Come to Crystal!” She gave Kent a lopsided grin. He missed it. He was toopreoccupied with her 38-C hooters. Stuck right out there right in front of Godand everybody.“We’ll be hiding right across the glade, Kid, so don’t you worry your sweetlittle head about a thing.” I patted her head.“If you let that skunk ape come near me, Dan, so help me—I’ll—I’ll…”“Yeah I know. But like Sgt. Kent says, the town is about to be foreclosed.Everybody is too scared to come out at night so the cops can’t arrest anyone. Indesperate times it takes desperate measures to survive. If there really is a sexbeast out there, your Chanel No. 5 is going to draw him in. He gets anywhereclose and he’s blown to bits. If there ain’t no sex beast then we can have apress conference and announce that we have run a test and the coast is clear.”“Oh, Dan, I want to help, really I do, but why do I have to wear these chains?”“That’s so you don’t wander off, Crystal. You don’t realize how important a roleyou play in saving the community. The hookers need to get back on the street.They’re the lifeblood of the municipal government. I’ll buy you a nice presentfrom the police slush fund for your contribution. You’re a good girl.”Kent and I secreted ourselves behind a small blind equipped with a starlightscope, and watched Crystal. She ran her hand back through her hair. Cricketsbegan to crank up. Gloom descended on the glade. She peered into the darknessand dilated her nostrils in an effort to pick up the scent of any sex beaststhat might be skulking nearby. She started singing wistfully in a tremulousvoice, “Someday my prince will come, some day I’ll find someone…““How’d you scoop that luscious piece of ass?” George wanted to know. He wasstaring at Crystal’s naked titties through the starlight scope.“That’s prime tail, George, free, white and 21. Fresh off a flight fromHollywood, California. One of the new starlets they brought in for this season’sMiami Vice. Crystal Beavers. She was on the cover of New Faces and StarPeople—didn’t you see her there?”“Can’t say as I did, Dan, but I’m sure getting an eyeful here.” She was slappingat bugs. Kent zoomed in on one perky nipple and grabbed his crotch. He hadpicked up a taste for premature tail working the Juvenile Division. Crack-madlittle sluts with mouths that lie and suck with equal fervor. “You Miami heatget all the good pussy. Stuff we have up here in Oakland Park is strictlycommercial grade. I sure could use me a taste of that sweet California wine.”“Crystal’s spoken for. She’s poison ivy, my man: you can look but you better nottouch. She does get off on being looked at, though. You ever met an actress whocould resist dropping her pants in public?”“Never met an actress at all, Kelly! I keep telling you, Oakland Park ain’tMiami.”No, but Oakland Park supposedly had something unknown in Miami or anywhere elseon the face of the earth: the Sex Beast. And with any luck, the horny monsterwould soon be drawn into the snare that we had baited with the naked teen awashin an aura of Chanel. The prowl of the Sex Beast began with the rise of the moon. He knew the placeswhere the humans came to mate. His prey would come, they always did. And always,they would die. As the moon loomed over the banyan tree that sheltered his bug,the monster replaced the batteries in his conical head, and settled it in placewith the red eyes now pulsing with a renewed glow. He donned the heavy hairycoat and strapped on the killing paws with the steel claws honed tostiletto-blade sharpness. Then he went into his crouch and began to sway backand forth in the moonlight. Crystal was scratching and slapping at mosquitoes between choruses of “TheMonster Mash.” Dan had insisted that she couldn’t use any bug repellent, becauseit would confuse the scent of the Chanel. After a while, she quieted down, herforced cheerfulness beginning to flag. She was cranky, annoyed and downrightuncomfortable in the moonlit gloom of the woodsy copse. There were noises. Therecould be snakes. Rats. Roaches. There were bugs, and it was muggy and hot, evenlong after sundown. Her skin was sticky. She closed her eyes and imaginedherself relaxing in her Bathroom Sweet.She came back to her surroundings with a start. What had she heard? She peeredinto the shadows and caught a slight movement. Then came a low growl and asnarl. Her heart thumped and she emitted a tiny squeak of alarm. Her hair stoodstraight up all over her head and down her neck. This was real!The brown, matted heap of fur took shape as it stealthily approached her acrossthe open area of the glade. It seemed to be advancing on all fours, with aweird, uneven shambling gait. The thing moved within a dozen feet of her andsuddenly reared up to its full height. It was a monster movie come to life for agirl raised on the Saturday Creature Feature. The beast looming over herreminded her of the Wolfman, but with features like an ape. And the stink!Crystal screamed with mortal terror and revulsion as the beast lumbered towardher. She tried to run but fell flat, her leg held fast by the steel chain.Suddenly the area was lit with an incandescent strobe light. The beast turned toface this unexpected source of annoyance. The videocam whirred. Kent sightedbetween the glowing red eyes and blasted off a round. The beast did not react.Kent fired again, and a puff of dust jumped where the bullet struck the monsterjust above the left eye. The beast stood fast and did not flinch. Kent droppedhis gun and ran shrieking into the woods. The beast dropped to all fours andshambled away into the woods. The illuminated night resounded to the desperatescreams of Crystal in chains and the crash of underbrush as both Kent and themonster tore through the swamp fleeing from each other. “He was ten feet tall with big fangs, and long claws that made click-clicknoises. He had a lot of long black fur and a cone-shaped head with pulsing redeyes. He smelled worse than a skunk—the smell was like something dead. When hestood up, I could see he had this huge thing on him—it was big and black andhard, and he was aiming it straight towards me. I was so scared he would rapeme, I fell off the log.” That’s what Crystal had told the reporter from The Sun.It was an exclusive interview, and the price was $70,000. Cash in hand to me, ofcourse.The cover was a full-color picture of Crystal falling backwards off the log,with the chain around her ankle clearly depicted. The furry bulk of the sexbeast loomed over her and dominated most of the picture, but it was hard to makeout what he looked like. The banner screamed: “Naked Starlet Escapes Lust-CrazedSex Beast.” The tabloids went insane, and a week later they all had theirfollow-up stories.Crystal scissored one out of The Inquisitor that shrilled: “Florida Police UseChained Virgin as Monster Bait!” She pasted it into the neat scrapbook that wasquickly thickening. “Dan, I can hardly believe that’s me on the cover of TheSun. What in the world was that thing, anyway?”“A skunk ape, I guess. How the hell would I know? The important thing is you aresafe and unhurt.”“I love you, Dan. I’ll do anything to make you happy. You saved my life, Iknow.”I sipped the bitter Cuban coffee. Drew slowly on a Camel. Eyed the adoring teenthrough narrowed lids as I blew smoke toward her. She was putty in my hands.What a refreshing change. Crystal was almost as fresh as crisp green cash.“Give it time, Honey. No need to rush anything. We’ve got all the time in theworld. You like being my Virgin Sex Slave?”“I love being your slave, Dan.”“Well, that’s encouraging.”“What became of your friend, Mr. Kent?”“State Hospital at Chattahoochee. The Oakland Park PD is denying everything.They claim he went nuts on them and they’re not responsible. The whole thingnever happened, none of it.”“But we were there, Dan! Look at the marks that chain left on me, look at allthese mosquito bites!”“Fifty grand from the slush fund says we’ve never set foot in Oakland Park.”“But what about my career? My press conferences? The offer from Hustler to dothe Taming of the Sex Beast photo layout?”“Forget all that, Kid. We’ve got better things to do.”“WHAT better things?” Crystal shrieked, highly agitated.I unzipped my trousers and took out my cock. “Gonna make you a star, Babydoll,and this is where it all starts. Hit the deck and get to work.”Crystal tossed her hair and made a face. “Yuck!”Two seconds later she was sprawled across the sunroom floor with a mouse formingunder her eye. I stood over her as she pulled herself up.“Suck cock. Vacation’s over.”Crystal shook her head slowly to clear her senses, and then she crawled forwardon all fours, nuzzled up to my crotch, and began to learn her new trade. Beauregard Morris was not in his own bed. This fact did not surprise him, sinceit was his habit to sleep around as often as possible. He sat up and groped forhis first cig of the day. Peering around the room without his glasses, he fishedin his deerskin bag for a Virginia Slim. The pink champagne standing in theplastic stemware next to the greasy, crusted dildo was devoid of any vestiges offizz.A gang of tiny monsters were whacking away at the inside of his skull. It wasdepressing. It was a conspiracy. Beau briefly considered suicide, then realizedhe had no idea where he was and suicide would undoubtedly be regarded asunflattering under the circumstances.He sniffed deprecatingly. He should have been able to make it with a betterclass of queers than this. After all hadn’t he a name, wasn’t he a personality?He was somebody, sort of.Obviously, he still hadn’t hit the big time. For years, he’d been searching foranother bondage master, someone with a firm hand like Karl the German Conquerorbut somehow nothing had never been the same. Beau yawned, stretched and fartedluxuriously. He sat up and lit the Virginia Slim and took a delicate drag,letting the smoke flow out his mouth while inhaling it with his nose,French-style. A clock ticked away loudly and insistently, grating his nerves ashe knocked an abalone shell overflowing with butts onto the floor beside thebed. “Oh dear,” Beau sighed aloud to nobody.The bedroom was small and stuffy. It smelled of mildew and stale sex. Too manylate nights, too many half-hard dicks. He called out, “Yoo-hoo! Anybody home?”A clump of boots was came his way, and finally the host made his appearance. Hewas an aged biker in heavy leather and big engineer’s boots with an abundance ofdecorative straps and studs and buckles. The old rogue was fat and balding witha beer belly and black grease, or something, lining his fingernails. He gaveBeau a wide grin full of ragged and rotten teeth.“Well, well, well. I thought Sleeping Beauty would never wake! You sure can putaway the bubbly, Doc. Take a pretty good length of fist too.” Beau lookedconfused and he chuckled, “How does it feel to be an honorary member of Wheelsof Terror?”Beau gazed on the pockmarked visage before him and could swear on fortybrand-new Bibles that he had never laid eyes on him before in his life. And whatwas that about the fist? And the terror? Either things were moving too fast orhe was moving too slow. “I say, have we been properly introduced?” he offeredwith a wry smile.The big ugly biker eyed Beau and favored him with a hearty guffaw. “You wereconcentrating so hard on my cock you might not have took much notice of my face.You wanna run me some early morning head?” The biker faggot unzipped his leatherpants and shook his cock at Beau.Beau took another drag at his Virginia Slim and politely shook his head. “Yougotta be kidding, Buster?”“Ain’t no joke at all, Honey.” The cycle tramp ran his greasy hand back over hisbalding pate and gave Beau a long, smoldering look. “I’ve gotta be down to thebike shop in an hour. That’ll give me time to run this here reamer up your tailpipe again, maybe spark a few memories.” The queer stroked his cock to erectattention.Beau eyed the dick with lingering admiration. A recollection seemed to be comingback. He really ought to ease up on the champagne. “Not right now, Loverboy,”Beau pouted, “my head hurts.”Snubbing out the cigarette, Beau rolled out of the filthy bed and pulled hispink negligee over his head. Underneath he wore his favorite black rubber garterbelt, black fishnet hose and a crotchless frilly pink panty. He ran his fingersthrough his tangled hair and exclaimed, “My do! It’s destroyed!” The biker justshrugged and lumbered out of the room.Beau wandered into the bathroom and sat down on the toilet to take a piss.“Where am I?” he howled in despair.“Why, Atlanta obviously, right where you’ve always been,” came the answerthrough the door.“That’s not what I meant,” he answered half to himself. He didn’t know what hedid mean, and fortunately his new friend let it drop.Beau hit the shower and tried to clean up the detritus of last night’s revel. Hedowned four Excedrins and squeezed himself into his trademark hot pink shirt andtight black pants. Leaning into the mirror, Beau observed the indelible marks ofMistress Time and Master Dewars. He really didn’t look too good, but hecomforted himself with the thought that at least he’d never stooped to smokingcrack. Of course blow was another thing. He’d wouldn’t turn down a line ortwo—or three—if it was laid out on a mirror as a love offering, but he intendedto steer clear of the hard stuff, the stuff that kills. A twinge of concernflashed through his sodden brain: AIDS. No. Couldn’t be, it’s just ahangover—the bleary, sick-looking eyes of this parody of his lovely, queenlyself staring back at him. All it’d take would be a nice facial, manicure, andmassage at Adrian’s to be positively radiant again. He simply had to quit thisdangerous slumming…but it was so hard when he was such a fool for these bikers,the Nazi crowd, the leather boys. He let himself get swept off his feet time andtime again, and each time he swore this one would be his last fling. Thosesteely thighs, those hard throbbing cocks, those thrusting fists…he sighed andfluffed his locks.Beau was confident that he could still catch the right man if he simply appliedhis mind to it. He couldn’t stand those flits in the gay bars. He was a real manand so was his fantasy lover. He’d keep the faith; one day the right guy wouldcome along and—BINGO! They’d get married. Maybe they’d get a house in CobbCounty where they could raise some Weimaraners. Or a nice little condo inMidtown.Beau’s eyes were the color of pond scum, and he was running to flab, but he hada thick crop of longish brown hair, nice dental work, and a certain charisma.And now he was an honorary member of Wheels of Terror. He contemplated how thatmight be used to his professional benefit in the years to come. He wondered whathis initiation had been.He was still dreaming about how his prestige would attract Mr. Wonderful when hebreezed through the kitchen, waving a hand casually at Mr. Dreadful, who wastalking on the phone to someone named Dieter, as he passed out the back door.Fortunately, the cordovan BMW was parked right in back, and it appeared to beintact.As he wheeled the Beamer out of the complex he realized he was on Roswell Road,not too far from a decent Dunk’n Dine. He always could count on their coffee toslap him into shape when he’d had a little too much fun. Inside the lobby of theDunk’n Dine were racks of the Atlanta Journal, and while he waited for a seat,his eye fell on the headlines: “AIDS Death Plague Decimates America.” That washardly news. Again there was that twinge. He knew he’d been playing RussianRoulette with his sex life. The herpes was bad enough. He took L-lysine tocontrol his outbreaks, but still once you got it, you had it for life. ButAIDS—it will take you out. Slowly and painfully, and in shame. Beau’d had togive up keeping count of the friends and colleagues he’d lost. Bad, bad, bad.His eyes fell to the second lead story: “Schoolgirl Raped and Killed by Apeman.”The pond slime covering his eyes came to life at once; it feasted on stories ofmurder, mayhem, and perversion. This was something novel indeed that he mightuse to buck up his flagging career as an expert on serial killers. He was wellaware that his first book Serial Killer Madness was nothing more than highbrowslasher stuff. He’d thrown it together in six months after making a boast overherb tea and croissants one day that he could get away with saying anything atall in print, just on the basis of his reputation as a psychologist.Dear madcap Truman, now gone to his final reward. It was Truman who had firstturned him on to the cash value of mass murder. He remembered the whole scene.How Tru had sat him down and cozied up, stroking his thigh, while he explainedthe public fascination with mass murder, devilish cults, vampires, homicidalmaniacs and bizarre fiends of all stripes. There’s big money in bloody murder,he said. The best-sellers are the ones where everyone is murdered or executed bythe end of the book. And even the most superficial glance at the numbers provedthat Tru was right.Serial Killer Madness had given him a pretty good ride, although from time totime his flagrant disregard for facts was brought up in a lawsuit. So far hispublishers had managed to settle everything out of court, but who knows? One ofthose killers might change his mind one day and decide to take offense. Thiscreature called the sex beast…if he really was a beast, he probably wouldn’thave a lawyer. Beau grabbed the Journal and mulled over different angles whilehe nursed his coffee: “Beast Feast”…“Mark of the Beast”…what a story. The thingripped his victims apart and ate them up. That was the icing on the cake. Wonderwhere Oakland Park is. There was only one thing to do: go where the story is.The police, prosecutors, victims, all would scurry to his aid once he made itknown that the world-famous serial killer expert was on the case. And if theydidn’t, that was OK too. Beau knew how to suck ass even better than he couldsuck cock. He knew they’d see things his way—eventually. The doctors who had told him he was incurable were probably right. He seemed tohave more trouble sorting out his tangled thoughts lately. It had been a lotworse since those little men from the UFO had stuck that needle in his brain toretune it. He lifted up the furry conehead and studied the two bullet holes, oneslightly above the brow of the left eye, the other squarely between them. Closecall, but fortunately the bullets had passed right through the frame withoutdamaging the wiring. The red eyes glowed from deep in their hairy nests.The fiend recalled the screaming naked female chained to the log. Her greasy,salty blood was what he wanted to taste. It wasn’t fair. He slipped on a paw andslashed at the air as he recalled the blinding white light and flashing gunfire,emitting a low growl and a sibilant hiss. His unfulfilled passion was making himnervous. He removed the paw, sniffed the sour air of the cavelike apartment andshambled over to the icebox. He peered in. The blank eyes of the human theycalled Jolie stared at him from inside a plastic bag. The fiend smiled benignlyand lifted Jolie carefully out of the fridge. He removed the bag, rolled thehead out onto the countertop and sawed off the top of the skull. He sniffed atthe congealed brains, and then began to feed, dipping in with both hands,slurping and smacking his lips as he grunted with satisfaction. He always savedthe best for last. Chief Warren “Bubba” Fitz Williams of the Oakland Park Police Department laidhis best shiteating smile on the lady reporter from Shocking Crime magazine, andsaid, “There’s no such thing as a Sex Beast.” His mouth was smiling but his eyeswere cold.She was a looker in a Pierre Cardin suit, with shaggy black hair piled on top ofher head, artfully secured with combs so that it fell free in a casual tumble.Her dark brown eyes were crackling with intelligence. Fitz Williams would haveto be careful not to be distracted.The lady touched her Montblanc pen to her nose and coolly inquired, “What do yousuppose it was that split the victim’s vagina and pushed her uterus up under herheart? Could Goodleigh have been responsible for that?”Fitz Williams had the good manners to blush. “That’s a question for the CountyMedical Examiner, Ms. Stuart. I’m just a cop. My job is catching criminals. Werun an honest shop here at the Station. We do the best we can.”“Goodleigh was a local social studies teacher with a history of molesting younggirls, isn’t that true?”“Mr. Goodleigh is a victim here, he’s under no suspicion of wrongdoing.”“What was he doing naked in the woods with a sixteen-year old girl? Giving her ageography tutorial?”“We really can’t say, Ms. Stuart.”“Is that can’t—or won’t?”The Chief stood up. “If you have no further questions, I’m very busy…”She leaned back in the chair, making herself comfortable. “Oh, but I do haveother questions. Our readers want to know the facts.” She flipped pages on herpad and fired at him, “Isn’t it true that there have been increased reports ofUFO sightings in Oakland Park since the Sex Beast’s appearance?”Fitz Williams sighed and sat down. Every nut in the county had been burning upthe phone lines with tips on UFO’s and men skulking about in ape costumes. He’dtaken another call not fifteen minutes before this nutsy broad showed up. A ladyin Wilton Manors had seen a neighbor in a monkey suit taking out a bag of trashto his curb late last night. She admitted there was a pickup this morning, andthere was no law against wearing a costume. He wanted to know why she didn’tcall the Wilton Manors police about it. She opined that they never answered hercalls, and anyway since it was the Oakland Park Sex Beast, she figured she’dbest call them to come get him. Fitz Williams gave the lady the number of thatTV show Inside Edition and suggested she call them at once.“So you admit there is a connection between the Sex Beast and increased UFOactivity?”Fitz Williams nodded absently and hoped if he ignored her she would just goaway. Crystal picked up the copy of the latest issue of Shocking Crime. The magazinecover showed a naked girl being dragged into a swamp by a gorilla, with a flyingsaucer hovering just off the ground behind them. “Police Chief Blames UFOs forSex Beast Murders” was the screamer. Crystal opened the magazine and avidlyflipped to the story. The writer was StarGlow Stuart, Queen of the ExposeGalaxy. StarGlow was famous. Crystal had seen her on Geraldo, and even heard heron the Howard Stern Show. She tried to call in, but she could never get throughthe switchboard. Crystal rubbed her temples in torment as she read the story. Itwas being treated as a big mystery. It seems nobody knew the true story but her!She couldn’t help herself. She reached for the phone and called Shocking Crime.“Hello, may I please speak to StarGlow?”“I’m sorry, she’s working on a story right now. May I take a message please?”“This is Crystal Beavers—you know, the movie starlet the Sex Beast almost ate? Iwant to talk to StarGlow Stuart about what really happened when I was chainednaked in the swamp by the police.”“One moment please.”Crystal was amazed and pleased when StarGlow came right on the line. She was sovery nice that Crystal started telling her everything. The whole story wastumbling out of her mouth at once. She was even more amazed when StarGlowinterrupted her to say she’d be glad to stop by in person so they could talk itover and she’d even bring Crystal an autographed picture for her Sex Beastscrapbook.Would that be OK?Crystal was so excited she blurted out the address without thinking and hung up.It was only then that she began to tremble at the thought of what Dirty Danmight do if he opened the door to find himself confronting the fiery eyes ofStarGlow Stuart. Dan didn’t like surprises. Crystal hugged herself and rockedback and forth, whispering “Ooooh! Ooooh! Ooooh!” until she couldn’t stand itany longer. She jumped up and ran in the kitchen for a Coke Classic and twoTwinkies and came back to flop down on the floor in front of the giant screen.She clicked on the Disney Channel and tried to lose herself in sugar andcartoons while she pondered suicide. “Anyone ever suck your pussy, kid?”She blinked. Shook her head from side to side.“Spit it out, what happened?”“Nothing. Arvin said it smelled nasty. I reckon he was being honest about it.”She shrugged. “What do you mean someone sucking on it?” She was curious.“Just a little something that a man can do to make a special young lady feelreal good.”“How does it go?”I ran my hand over my Don Johnson stubble and wondered at a town where a girlcan reach sixteen and never have her pussy sucked. Keokuk, Iowa. Must be onebackward burg. I told her to lay down on the bed and spread her legs. Sheunderstood that part well enough.Crystal was soon moaning softly as my tongue slipped between the cleansed foldsof her cunnus. It was dry and sweet and smelled of the perfumed soap she hadbeen rubbing between the crack of her ass. The flow of Crystal’s sexual arousalbegan to slicken her cunt crease, and I thrust my tongue into her with patientdemand. I lapped her snatch until her hole was smeared with slippery passionjuices.“Oh yes! Yes!” Crystal moaned. The scarlet fingernails of her tapered handsscratched at the crown of my head. She took deep breaths as her hips writhedunder my mouth. The swollen head of her clit rubbed against my tongue as Irolled it with a steady motion and set a rhythm guaranteed to drive her todistraction.My mouth was smeared with her creamy wetness as I sank my tongue into her fuckhole, then drew slowly back and worried the bulb of her clit. My quickenedlapping rhythm was taking her closer to the edge, so I went into thesyncopation. Her thighs tensed. Her hands tangled in my hair. I pushed twofingers into her depths, then pulled upward with a strong motion, while I poppedher clit with the edge of my front teeth. Crystal gasped in ecstasy, “Oh! OhJesus! Oh God!”Crystal went rigid with pleasure and shuddered through the spasms that releasedher copious sweet fluids, finally lying still with the insides of her smooththighs festooned with the vestiges of her arousal.“Oooooohhh,” was all she could manage for several minutes. Then she sighed.“Dan, lover, that was so beautiful. Where did you learn to do that?”I rolled her over on her stomach and gave her a sharp smack on her succulentbare behind. She raised it. Spread her tail.“I’ll never tell,” I smiled.MURDER 101It was well past midnight, the black hour when evil is afoot I in the city.My eyes flew open from a dreamless sleep; I lay on the cool blue silk sheets andfelt the onerous weight of a premonition of doom settle down upon my soul.Beside me I felt the pressing warmth of sweet young flesh.Crystal Beavers, eyes closed and mouth open, snored lightly. I watched thesteady rise and fall of her delectable bosom in the dim moonlight. The luminousdial on my Rolex announced that it was past three. I slid my hand with casualfamiliarity over the luscious curve of Crystal’s shapely rump, and felt her stirin her sleep; she inched toward me mumbling, “Dan, honey, love me!”I ignored her pleading, and focused my attention on the murderous vibes that hadcome to me unbidden in the night. Crystal’s soft hand seized my penis and beganto tug at it with a rhythmic motion. My concentration broke and I shoved Crystalout of the bed onto the floor.“Dan!” she squealed, “What are you doing kicking me out of the bed?”Crystal knelt submissively on the floor in the moonlight, her chestnut tressestumbling around her shoulders in erotic disarray. She blinked and snuffled. “Youtreat me so mean, Dan! All I wanted to do was make love to you. Don’t you loveme anymore?”I’d heard that line from her before. I threw her a steely look. “I’ve told younot to annoy me with that sex crap while I’m working.”She crawled over to the bedside table and peered at the clock. “You’re working?Are you crazy? It’s three o’clock in the morning. You were feeling up my butt! Ithought that you wanted me. What’s the matter with you?”“There’s murder in the air, kid. I can feel it. I’ve got a built-in murderdetector in my brain. When murders happen I tune right in on it.”Crystal jumped up and look out the window. “Dan, do you think that the SexBeasts could be coming in from the swamps? We’ve been due for an invasion. I wasjust reading about it in StarGlow’s astrology column the other day. Could it becoming to pass here in the night?”Crystal focused her attention on the twinkling city spread out sixteen storiesbelow. I focused my attention on her naked behind. It was an admirable sightagainst the soft glow of the city lights. The kid was growing up, filling out;pretty soon she’d bee too old for the Lolita trade. Changes. I’d have to learnto live with them or find a way to get rid of her.“Too late for the Sex Beasts, Honey. They’re twilight creatures, do most oftheir trolling just when the sun goes down. I don’t think the vibe I was pickingup was a Sex Beast. It came to me as more malignant. Like the time I chased theButcher. I could almost feel him cutting and slashing his way through the fleshof those innocent young hookers. I was laying there trying to make some senseout of those bad vibes when you started fooling around. You have a terminal caseof hot pants…when you’re wearing pants…speaking of which, put some on and getyour tail into the kitchen and make me breakfast.”Crystal turned, put her hands on her hips and whined, “You always blame me!Anything goes wrong in your life and it’s my fault, why is that?”“Because you’re a whore and whores cause a lot of trouble in the world. Yourjust have no idea the problems women like yourself cause.” I snapped on thebedside lamp and Crystal squinted her eyes. I noticed that her pubic mound wassprouting a five o’clock shadow. “What did I tell you about keeping your snatchshaved smooth, kid? Do you need a session with my belt to help your memory?”Crystal scratched at her pussy absently, ignoring my question. She rolled hereyes; then after a moment she commented poutily, “You said to keep it smooth andoiled for the customers because that’s the way they like it.”“That’s all I said? Think hard.”She pursed her lips. Giggled. “You said to keep it shaved and oiled or you’dkick my ass.”I looked her over. “C’mere.”She minced forward and stood before me, hands on her hips, bosom outthrust, herbig brown nipples erect. I seized her about the hips and ran my tongue over herpubic area, felt her prickly stubble tickle my lips and scratch my nose. Isavored the warm musky scent of her crotch, slid my tongue toward her clit.“Illegal search and seizure!” she yelped, twisting free and dancing away with achuckle. I bounced off the bed and swung my foot at the jiggling behind. Icaught a well-padded butt cheek with a meaty smack. “Get your tail into thekitchen and put on the coffee, and if your twat isn’t smooth when I come offduty tonight I’ll take a riding crop to your fanny.”Crystal rubbed her saucy fanny. “Promises, promises. You always tell me that youare going to use that riding crop on me but you never do. When are you going togive a little tickle?” She look back over her shoulder at me and grinned, thensaid, “I do know of this freak who will pay to watch a girl shave her pussy. Oneof Melina’s girls told me about him. Do you think I should call him up and makehim an offer?”“I don’t see why not!” I watched Crystal swinging her butt toward the kitchen;then I picked up my shoulder holster and headed for the shower. The day was getting off to a bad start and promised to get worse. Thepremonition of bad trouble nibbled away at my brain like a hungry rat gnawing ata fresh corpse. My cases were all running down blind alleys and into stonewalls. My spirits dropped another notch when I found the note on my desk sayingto report to the Porker the minute I hit the squad room. I was in no mood tolisten to the Chief’s bullshit…or to practice diplomacy.Chief Pork Shepherd was flopped in his Chief’s chair when I walked into hisoffice, all three hundred and twenty pounds of him. He was leafing through amissing persons report. I recognized it at once. I was assigned to the case. Twoyoung chippies that turned up missing. They were still missing and the waythings were shaping up, I doubted that they would ever be found. The Porkerfavored me with a politician’s grin.“Danno, me lad, what’s the status on the missing girls from the Blessed VirginMary Academy? Sister Mary Immaculata, the Mother Superior out there, has beenburning up the telephone lines…God Bless Her Soul…wanting to know if we’ve foundany trace of her lost lambs. I trust you have a line on where they might be?”I rubbed the stubble on my chin and looked forlornly at my shoes. They needed ashine in the worst way. I did a quick mental review of the case. It had notseemed like an important one at the time. It began with a missing corpse. Thefresh young corpse of a Blessed Virgin Mary Academy senior who had been killedin an unfortunate and routine traffic accident. The corpse of this tenderyoungster had apparently been misplaced somewhere. Those things do happen.At first I had treated it as grand theft corpus but the deeper I dug, the moreit began to look like mere negligence…but then there were the back to backdisappearances of two nubile seniors from the same school, who had last beenseen entering the dangerous area of Little Haiti. I’d tracked them to anoff-beat curiosity shop specializing in weird items, and decided to stop therebefore breaking into a scandal that would put the Good Sisters at the priceygirl’s school in a bad light.Yet there was that common link surrounding these known dead and missing BVMAcademy seniors…and damn fine young vixens they were too. They had vanished asif they had been swallowed up by the earth itself. I felt that the directapproach was best with the Chief.“It’s a mystery, Chief, damnedest case I’ve ever seen. First, the corpse up anddisappears; then the two gal pals take a powder and are never seen again. Not atrace. No calls to daddy for funds, no calls to their school chums letting themknow they are out on a lark. Nothing. I talked to one of the employees out thereat the Eternal Rest Mortuary, a nice young man name of Nolte. Actually he seemeda bit odd, but then what do you expect to encounter in a place like that? Whatkind of kid works in an undertaking establishment? I asked myself that, but Icouldn’t come up with an answer that made any sense.”“Get to the point, Danno, I’m a busy man and the archbishop is waiting for mycall with respect to this case.”“The young man, Nolte, he told me that he remembers the girl coming in. Said shehad a broken neck. Classic whiplash death. He claims that he put her in thecooler himself…so then he doesn’t know anything else. Says that as far as heknows that the bimbo disappeared right out of the cooler. I have it pegged for acivil problem. Airlines lose luggage, mortuaries lose corpses. What the hell,Chief, I say that we write it off and let the local insurance people wrangleover it.”The Porker nodded agreeably. He seemed to accept my assessment of the case.People were always losing things, why not corpses? It wasn’t a crime, it wasn’teven police business. What was left? Body snatchers? Ghouls? But missing personswas quite another matter.“Yeah Danno, we can write off the stiff. A civil problem like you say, but whatabout those two Academy babes? What sort of leads have you come up with? Or whathaven’t you come up with might be stating it better.”“Runaways is how I see it. It’s been less than a month but if they were deadsomeone would have found them. Dump them in a canal and in three days you have apair of gas bags popping to the surface, and we could go out and pick them up.Dead in a ditch and they’d surface. Dump them in a field and someone would havebeen calling in about the stink. Those young girls ripen fast in the summer. SoI figure they’re still alive somewhere. I’ve rousted a few of the street hookersand the girls tell me there are no BVM girls on the stroll. It looks to me likethey’ve blown the city. Stuck out their thumbs and caught a ride. West coastwould be my guess. I wouldn’t doubt they’re already spread all over somebody’scasting couch out in Hollywood. Who can figure teenaged cunt? They’re amystery.”Pork grunted and shook his jowls at me. “I pay you to figure it out, Danno. Andwhat will I be telling the darling blessed sisters when they are calling me onthe telephone asking about the lost ones? Sure and it will be the Pope of Romehimself calling me unless you come up with something that I can pass on to thearchbishop. Something. Anything. If you can catch my meaning, old son.”“Tell the archbishop to order up a prayer vigil and be done with it,” I snortedand lit up a Camel.“Don’t be letting me hear you disrespect the Holy Church, Dan, me lad. They dome a world of good with every priest in the precinct telling the voting membersof his flock to pull the lever for me come November. They vote for me and I votefor you. Don’t I keep you on the payroll and turn away from a lot of the thingsthat you have cooking on the side, boyo? Like a certain piece of jailbait tailthat you are plugging up there in that fancy condo of yours?”“Fuck the Church!” I groaned. “After the way we wiped out that nest of dopepeddling bikers, the voters wouldn’t put you out of office even if you rode aHarley naked down Biscayne Boulevard at high noon!”Pork smiled. Then he frowned. While I studied him he turned to his desk as thefax sprang to life. It may have saved me from a violent retort.I watched the Chief’s eyes widen as he scanned the paper flimsy spewing from hismachine. Suddenly he seized the rattling paper with both hands and roared, “MyGod! They are butchering coeds up at the University in Gainesville! Guttingthem! Cutting off their heads, for God’s sake! There’s a damned slaughter goingon up there!” Then the Chief sighed and said, “I’ll be thanking the good Lordthat the wretched killings are a good three hundred miles from my jurisdictionand may God help the poor fucker who is Chief in that bailiwick today!”“God and the FBI.”Coed butcherings interested me. It reminded me of the time that I was on thetrail of Butcher—the serial killer who had been released early from a lifesentence at Florida State Prison. I’d trailed his murdering ass into thetrackless swamps south of the Everglades before losing him. It was a thorn in myprofessional reputation that I’d never been able to bring the Butcher to the Barof Justice.The fax hummed again and coughed out another train of white paper. The Chiefglanced at it and remarked, “The people up in Alachua County are putting up areward of fifty thousand dollars for information leading to the arrest of theGainesville Slasher. By the Lord Harry, that will stir up the redneck boys andget them out on the road hunting for the murdering villain!”“I could use some of that cash myself, Chief! What would you say to a weeksleave of absence while I run on up there and solve that Slasher case for them?”That was the wrong thing to say. The Chief abruptly returned to business.“You’ve got yourself a week to come up with something on those two girls fromthe BVM Academy. You get out there and get me some results or you’ll findyourself back on road patrol yanking pussycats out of trees and scooping updrunks off the sidewalks of this city. Do you read me loud and clear, boy?”I read the Chief clear enough. I got to my feet, tossed the Porker a salute andheaded for the Miami docks to see a man about a pair of virgins. You might sayhe was in the business. The big yellow sign on the side of the stucco warehouse read: FUAD’S EXOTICEXPORTS. I pulled my white city issue Plymouth into an empty parking space andtook a close look at the area. Heat of the day. No action.I levered myself out of the car and walked up to what passed for a front door.The door said ENTER but when I tried to walk in I found that it was locked, anodd state of affairs for what purported to be a thriving business establishmentin the heart of the dock district. I tried a hearty knock.I was not surprised to see a dark eye appear behind a Judas hole. A voicegrowled, “Fuck off, asshole!”My hand instinctively slipped into my waistband; I felt the comforting presenceof the police positive .38 special against my palm.“Vega set me!” I hissed toward the brown eye. “You haul ass and get thattowelhead Fuad out here pronto or I’ll have a search warrant down here infifteen minutes and we’ll take this dump apart plank by plank.”The Judas hole snapped closed. A minute later I heard the electronic snick ofdeadbolts being released. The front door opened and I was facing the corpulentowner of Exotic Imports, the Iraqi expatriate, Fuad Ramsak. He gave me a greasysmile. “Welcome, Excellency,” he announced. I was gonna get the royal treatment,or maybe a knife in my back. That all remained to be seen.“Detective Dan Kelly, Homicide and Vice. I’m here to ask you some questions andtake a look around; what do you have to say about that, Ramsak?”“Welcome, Excellency Kelly!” he repeated in a cordial tone; holding out his armsas if to take me into a fraternal embrace. I’d be damned if I’d be seen hugginga sand nigger in downtown Miami, what would the guys in the squad room say ifthat story ever got around? I didn’t want to find out.I pushed past the towelhead. He stunk of garlic and spices. His face was greasywith the remnants of a lunch of roast mutton. “How can I be of service to you,Excellency Kelly?” The guy was so determined to cooperate, looked like Vega musthave warned him about me ahead of time. That would smooth things outconsiderably.“I’m looking for some young pussy, Fuad my friend. Do you think you can help meout with something like that here at Erotic—er, Exotic Exports?”Fuad issued a hearty chuckle as if he’d heard that one before. “Yes, of course!Fuad has the very finest in young poosie for you, my dear friend…and also one ortwo little poosies for my dear friend Mr. Vega of the United States CustomsService. Will that fine gentleman be joining us for some afternoon delights?”Unfortunately Vega wouldn’t be joining us today. He was busy setting up amulti-million dollar cocaine import deal with a pair of cowboys from the BogotaCartel. Flower vendors. Everybody likes pretty flowers and the good old U.S. ofA. imports a lot of them from Colombia. There are other things that come inthose flower boxes, but that’s another story.I said, “Vega’s giving testimony in Federal Court today. He found a couple oftwelve year old Mexican girls in the Captain’s cabin on the Star of Norway withno papers. Stowaways, the captain said. The girls said white slavery. The girlssaid rape. So now the Captain is up for a life stretch in a Federal prison andthe little bimbos are on their way back to Mexico. Now what do you make of that,Fuad?”Fuad make an oily smacking sound with his lips and grinned lasciviously. “Youngpoosie, it is wonderful, is it not? But so much trouble when one brings it intoport here in this country. Now in my own country…”“Cut the bullshit, Fuad, I want to take a quick tour of what you have downstairsin your slave cages, and I want that tour right now before all that poosie isdropped through the floor into the bay by your partners. There’s pressure on mefrom on high, and that means pressure on you down here. Shit slides downhillhere, same as in Iraq; so let’s get moving.”Fuad understood that it was a business visit and not a time for social niceties;he had the presence of mind to nod soberly and waddle away leaving a wake ofgarlic scented sweat. I drifted along behind him, remembering to keep my eyeswide open and one hand on my pistol. The warehouse look deserted, the airsmelled dead.Fuad spoke over his shoulder. “These young poosies, somebody in particular thatyou are having in your mind to seek out? My only desire is to please you, ofcourse, Excellency Kelly.”“Yeah, Fuad, there’s somebody in particular. Two somebodies in fact. A pair ofwould-be bimbolinas from the Blessed Virgin Mary Academy. White girls. RichDaddies. Virgins. Put them out on the street and they don’t know enough to wipetheir own asses. The Bishop of Miami wants their hot little twats back in theconvent. I’m thinking that the man is pissed off because they are his ownprivate stock, if you get my drift?”Fuad hissed with displeasure. “I know nothing of such young girls, Excellency.You must believe me. I am an honorable businessman. But two such virgins…theywould indeed be most valuable; and would they also happen to be twins by thegrace of Allah?”“Not twins. Schoolmates. You’ve seen the BVM girls capering around the malls.Sleek, chic, sassy—full of romantic foolishness and crazy notions. They mighteven sign up for a trip of the ancient ruins of the middle east, sign documentsin Arabic while under the influence of God only knows what kind of dope. Youknow how that works, don’t you?”Fuad sucked his teeth loudly. Grunted. We came to steel door with a brass lock.He took a big iron key from his pocket, slid it home and turned it.As Fuad pushed open the door I was confronted with a scene from beyond mywildest fantasies. Old Fuad was doing well for himself. Allah or the Devil orwhoever he was dealing with was sending him plenty of stock. Immediately to myright I saw a large steel cage that held over a dozen naked young girls—all wellfed and well formed, but eyes glassy with a heaping helping of the drug of theday.They lolled about indifferently on pillows and cots, with comic books andbaskets of fruit strewn about the floor of the cage. A television screenflickered in one corner. Fuad paused and waved a plump hand toward the sultrygroup. “Here you see prime goods, Excellency Kelly! The very finest Americangirls ages twelve through seventeen, and every one a young woman fit for anemir’s seraglio. These are my best stock. Do you see the ones here that you areseeking?”I looked the girls over carefully, studying their delectable nude bodies,appreciating each and every line. I took out my photo and compared the freshfaces of the Academy girls to the nymphets draped on the pillows in rapturouslanguor. I couldn’t make either one of my BVM chickies. “Are these the onlygirls you have, Fuad?” I asked.The fat Iraqi slavemaster giggled. “You told me, Excellency, that you aresearching for young virgins. These are surely not virgins. These are my beststock and not a virgin to be found in the entire lot. These are simply verylovely, clean and healthy girls, awaiting a sultan’s pleasure. Yes, mine are allguaranteed AIDS-free and anxious to please a new master. Young women of thisquality are not easy to come by, not even here in Miami, the center of all thelusts of the civilized world. Please, Excellency, can you tell me where I mightacquire sixteen year old virgins in Miami? For this would indeed be veryprofitable for me….”I realized that Fuad was serious and said, “You can get all the virgins you cancarry away over at the Blessed Virgin Mary Academy. The place is crawling withthem. The nuns give the girls some sort of an entrance physical and if the galsdon’t measure up as virgins then they don’t let them in the front door. Theproblem is that if you go over there hunting them you’ll have the Bishop ofMiami breathing down your neck. Now what do you have here in the line ofvirgins? Round them up and run them past me so I can be on my way. I’m a busyman.”“Come with me.” Fuad sighed, and took off walking. I brought up the rear keepingan eye peeled for trouble. He took me down a long corridor with naked women incages arranged along each wall. Women of every size and shape and nationality.Some called out in foreign languages as we walked past. Yes, business wasbooming but there did seem to be a curious overabundance. I decided to venture acomment to see where it would lead. “Business may be good, Fuad, but you seem tobe overstocked. Have you been giving any thought to a half-price sale orsomething along those lines?” The fat Iraqi sighed again and stopped. I hadapparently touched a sensitive nerve.“The embargo in the Middle East is hurting me badly, Excellency. Warships ofevery nationality are now plying the Arabian Gulf, the Red Sea, theMediterranean. My holding pens are filled to capacity, you can observe this factfor yourself. Yes, it is a problem.”Suddenly my nostrils picked up a familiar scent as my eyes picked up the sightof a tangled heap of naked female corpses piled near a trap door cut into thecement floor. I called to the bozo camel jockey to rein in and gestured towardthe heap of dead bodies. “Are you taking up murder to eliminate theoverabundance, Fuad?”He shrugged.I strolled over to the jumble of tangled limbs and knelt beside a blue-facedblonde wearing a knotted nylon stocking around her neck in a makeshift choker. Ipicked up her head by the long hair and glanced into her empty clouded eyes.“What do we have here, Fuad, a case of mass suicide?”Fuad wrung his hands in obvious dismay. “Be careful, Excellency, those corpsesare infected with the death plague. The AIDS. You could contract it from yourproximity to those diseased women. Please, do be cautious.”The blonde’s bloated tongue hung out of her mouth, drool glistening on the deadlips. She looked to be a ripe seventeen. I stood up and gave her a nudge with mytoe. “This one looks like she was healthy enough, Fuad. She doesn’t look sick atall but she sure as shit looks dead. You wouldn’t by any chance be running asnuff film operation in this building, would you, fat boy? Maybe cutting in onMelina’s Freak House action? Because if I find out that you are, I will see yourfat ass fry in the state electric chair. Your license in this town does notinclude murder and I’m looking at a heap of dead pussy laying at my feet. Whatdo you have to say for yourself?”Sweat poured from the shaved pate of the slavemaster. He knew he was in troubleand he went to his knees in supplication, flab trembling. “Excellency, pleasehear me out. These girls come to me from the streets of many cities, and forevery one hundred girls I purchase a certain percentage will be diseased. Thiscannot be helped! Those with the death plague are eliminated in the traditionalmanner of the harem. The silk cord or, as you see, the silk stocking is a worthysubstitute. The girls do not mind. One must consider these women as spoiledfruit. Damaged goods. Surely you can understand that the rotten ones must beculled out and quickly disposed of before they infect the others. Our product isknown around the world as being of top quality, and we must provide only thevery best. What you see here before you, it is an average group. We test theblood. The situation becomes worse each day. The girls coming in from the largecities—New York, Chicago, St. Louis—seventy to ninety percent must die, andquickly. They are death bringers in pretty packages. Please, Excellency, takecare as you handle that filth, it would grieve me to learn that you wereunfortunate enough to contract the death plague at my humble establishment.”I let Fuad sweat on his knees while I pawed through the stinking corpse pile.Pretty packages indeed. The majority of them were nothing but worn-out slutsfrom the massage parlors of Times Square and Forty-Second Street sent south tobe shunted into the canefield brothels near Belle Glade. The wide openwhorehouses adjacent to the U.S. Sugar refineries were an open secret of theState. It was a situation where young white girls sucked black cock and werepaid in heroin to do it. It was no wonder that Big Sugar had no problemrecruiting cheap black labor from the ghettos of Miami and the slums of theCaribbean Islands.I examined the jailhouse tattoos, the pimp brands, the needle tracks riding upthe arms of the dead whores. Fuad was doing the city a service be getting rid ofthem, and took me only a minute to realize that he was getting rid of plenty ofthem. It was only early afternoon but in the fetid August heat the bodies werealready beginning to swell, ripen and stink.“I see some serious sanitary code violations here, Fuad. It sure ain’t healthyto be leaving diseased cunt to rot out here in the open like this. You could getan epidemic going that would wipe out your entire stock, and then where wouldyou be? These diseases could spread into the city; it would go bad for you ifcertain people were to find out about this outrage against the health laws ofthe community.”He was speechless. I eyed the kneeling old sodomite, watching him nervously lickhis lips; I could sense the schemes whirling around under his towel. “What areyou doing about corpse disposal, old man? Are you trucking this load of rottingmeat out to the Kendall landfill, or what?”“Allah forbid, Excellency! I would never condone such an outrage against thepublic safety. I have paid money to insure that a garbage scow comes in hereafter dark to carry this refuse out to sea. The sharks…they are very numerousoff Miami, and they assist us in taking care of the problem. That is anacceptable solution, is it not, Excellency?”I shot him a cruel look. “That’s a Federal offense, Fuad. Pollution of the highseas. The Environmental Protection Agency handles those cases, I do believe.You’ve just confessed to dumping infected meat offshore for the sharks to eat.You have contaminated the fisheries of this country. That is a serious crime.You will be sent to a Federal pen for rehabilitation and from there you will bedeported directly to Baghdad. I will see to it personally.”Fuad wailed. “What is a poor tradesman to do, your Highness?”“This is serious business, Fuad; I have no choice but run your ass in. I cannotbe expected to simply close my eyes to the contamination of our nation’s coastalwaters.”The obese Iraqi fell forward on his face and began to grovel at my feet. Hegroveled well, whimpering and licking my shoes. They were in need of a spitshine, so I let him lave the leather with his long pink tongue.Finally he spoke, “Excellency, I beseech you in the name of Allah! Spare me thishorrible disaster. This is the work of my entire life; surely there is some waythat an accommodation can be reached? Is this not America, the wonderful land ofopportunities where all things are possible?”The old camel-fucker had a point. There were many possibilities indeed. Ithought of Mistress Melina and the operation out at Pradolini’s Gator Farm. Mymind clicked off some quick calculations. Pradolini was paying Melina thirtycents a pound for fresh meat on the hoof and twenty cents for the fresh frozenvariety. The old mafioso and Mistress Melina had a fine working arrangement, andas a result the old capo’s gators were fat and happy as any gators ever were.The hides were world-famous for their quality, and why not? Gators are immunethe AIDS virus, so they thrived on their deluxe diet.I caught the desperate fear in Fuad’s eyes, cut my glance to the pile ofputrefying flesh and said, “Fuad, I’m gonna give you a break…but you’ve got tostop murdering these poor, sick, helpless young girls. I’m going to arrange itso that you can send your castoffs over to the Hazelwood Institute where theycan receive the medical attention and professional nursing care that they sodesperately need. You won’t have to be wringing any more necks or feeding anymore sharks.”Fuad look up from his place on the floor with a curious look on his face.“Excellency, do you mean to say that I can just deliver the infected girls tothis hospital and that will be the end of it for me?” I shrugged. “Praise Allah,that is the answer to my prayers!”“Well, of course there will be a small charge of one hundred dollars per girl,with a minimum of ten girls to be delivered each day. The medical professionalsout there at the Institute will do the rest. Nurse Nancy Blue is the lady incharge out there, and you can pay her. Cash. The hundred dollars will coverminimal processing expenses for the girls…and of course I will be expecting tenthousand dollars for making these extraordinary arrangements for you.”Fuad Ramsak lifted his teary eyes to mine and thanked me profusely. I smiledbleakly, “Police work is a public service in this country, Fuad; we do our bestto serve the special needs of the community and the best interests of thetaxpayers. It would serve no good purpose to have you sent to prison, when it isobvious that you are a fine American citizen who is ready to accommodateauthority. Cooperation, that is what is best!”The corpulent Iraqi got to his feet and dusted off his knees. “Allah bepraised!” he howled. I let him howl. I liked the idea of that quick ten grandand he was more than eager to cough it up.“Fuad, what would you say to tossing in another ten thousand for the chief? Thatway we could be sure that those missing person reports that we get on a lot ofthose girls find their way into that file where nobody ever looks.” I smiled.Fuad never broke his stride. “Of course, Excellency, of course! I have the moneyright in the business safe. It will be a pleasure to donate something for thegood works of your chief.” I smiled and nodded, and swore to myself that thePorker would never see a dime of it.I was also looking forward to the delivery of almost four thousand infectedwhores per annum at one C-note each. That added up to a cool four hundred grand.The live delivery to Pradolini would come to another hundred and twenty thousandor so. I figured that a half a million was not a bad morning’s work, even forMiami. The sharks would have to go back on a diet of fresh mullet.“Now what about those virgins? Have you got any or not?”“Well…I will show you.”The virgin’s holding pen was a major disappointment. A single flaxen-hairedtwelve year old clutching a teddy bear ran to the bars of her cage as weapproached. She was as naked as the other women except for a protective plasticchastity belt form-fitted to her cunnus. The girl spoke to me in a foreigntongue and smiled shyly.“Finnish,” Fuad reported, “A special order from the Emir of Kuwait. One hundredthousand golden dinars for this perfect treasure…and now, no Kuwait—thanks tothat pig Saddam.”Fuad spoke to the girl in Arabic, fished a handful of chocolates from the foldsof his robe, and passed them through the bars to her. She smiled delightfullyand giggled, then fled to her cot and began to feed.“You can chat with her in Esperanto if you know the language,” Fuad said. Ididn’t know Esperanto or Finnish or Arabic. I felt foolish and uneducated but Icould say “Up against the wall, Motherfucker” in seven languages including bodylanguage. But since I had twenty thousand dollars in my pocket and had justclinched a half million dollar a year deal, I didn’t feel all that inadequate.There was more to life than linguistics. “She’s a cutie, Fuad, but she’s not thecutie that I’m interested in today.” The old rogue sighed with relief.Fuad gave me the grand tour. Let me search high and low, and when I was donewith my search I believed that the slavemaster was on the level and the Academygirls would not be found in his establishment. It was another strikeout, puttingme one day closer to the return to road patrol.I pocketed the cash and declined the offer of hospitality and green tea. I toldFuad to keep me informed on his stock of virgins, if any choice ones came in,and I’d be on my way.I left him the engraved business card of Nurse Nancy, Mistress Melina’sadministrative assistant out at the Hazelwood Institute for Social Research.Nurse Nancy was all pro, I assured him. She’d give the patients tender lovingcare right up to the very end.I was depressed as I walked into my digs at the Everglades Towers Condominiumbut when I heard what Crystal had to say I perked right up. The little minx camerunning up to me wearing only a skimpy bra and panty set and waving her latestcopy of Shocking Crime. The byline was StarGlow Stuart’s; the screamer headlinehowled: Coeds Butchered; Thousands Flee in Terror. A sidebar announced: 50Thousand Dollar Reward for Clues.Crystal jumped up and down in merriment yelling, “We’re rich, Dan! We’re rich!”Crystal loved the role. Probably practiced it in front of the mirror while I wasat work.“How did we get so rich, pussycat?” I asked.She looked at me as if I were a brainless dog. Then she smiled playfully andsaid, “Because we know who the Gainesville Slasher is, silly.”I blinked. “We do? Who is it?”“It’s that guy…you know, what’s-his-name? The one you were chasing all over thestate that time and I was going crazy with worry? The one who cut up all thegirls? Slit their bellies and hung them up by their heels in the woods and cutoff their heads? You know, Dan! The one where you had to go up to Starke and seethat writer who is the serial killer expert. Remember? He who told you about theguy they call the Butcher! It’s him! It’s the Butcher! I just know it is!”Crystal squealed and capered around the living room swinging the tabloid anddoing a little dance. She could be a real nut.As I remembered the Butcher case, I also remembered the StarGlow Stuart storythat had followed it in the Expose Galaxy rag True Crime Classics. StarGlow’sheadline was not complimentary. It read Butcher Madman Foils Miami’s DarkPrince. The prose written by the tabloid queen told of my trek across the state,always one step behind the desperate killer who slashed the heads from younggirls and wallowed in their hot guts.The Butcher had escaped into the trackless wastes of the Steinhatchee Swampafter committing another ghastly rape and murder along Alligator Alley. I knewthat one day the Butcher would be back seeking the blood of new victims. Crystalhad a good point, maybe the Butcher had returned!I chased Crystal down and snatched away her tabloid. I read the StarGlow storyabout the maniac that she had billed as the Gainesville Slasher. The M.O. waspure Butcher; I wondered if StarGlow had figured out the connection.The prospect of a quick fifty grand propelled me toward the telephone. I dialedthe number given in the reward story. A dulcet female voice answered on thethird ring. “Slasher hotline. Cathy speaking. May I help you?”I told the telephone girlie just how she could help me. “I read about the rewardfor information on the Gainesville Slasher. I’m calling to collect it. Who do Ihave to discuss it with?”The tolerant voice of Miss Chatty Cathy said, “If you know who the killer is,sir, simply give me the name and address where he is located and we will send asquad car out immediately to pick him up.”“I know who it is doing the killings. I wouldn’t be wasting my time calling youif I wasn’t sure. I want you to make sure that I am awarded the money. That I’mnot cheated. I know how you media people operate.”“I understand your concern, sir. Tell me who it is and leave me your name andaddress and the money will be sent to you in due course.”“I want to talk to the honcho, the man in charge of this operation. Put methrough to your supervisor immediately before I have you arrested for impeding apolice investigation.”I heard a sigh, a click and a whir; then a mechanical voice came onto the lineand said, “Thank you for calling the Slasher Hotline. Please leave the name andpresent location of the killer along with any important details about thecrimes. Be sure to include your name and address so that the reward may be sentto you upon the arrest of the killer. A certified police detective will becontacting you soon.”I looked at the telephone in disgust. What sort of Mickey Mouse operation werethey running up there in Gainesville anyway? I hung up. It was obvious that theSlasher Hotline was for armchair detectives and hopeless nut cases, little oldladies with visions of boogeymen under the bed. It was about what one wouldexpect from a crime tabloid hotline.I put in a call to the Gainesville Police Department and asked to speak to theirresident Slasher expert, Lt. Sadie Fennel. Sadie recognized my name from thedetective magazines and deigned to speak to me in person; it wasn’t every daythat she could talk to a celebrity detective from Miami and she probably wantedto make the most of it.“Dirty Dan Kelly! What a nice surprise! What in the world has prompted you tocall all the way up here to our little police department?”This Sadie Fennel was some smooth-talking broad, it was no surprise to me thatshe had wormed her way into some cushy public relations slot. “Listen up, Sadie,I have a line on the Slasher. Just picked up on it from a confidentialinformant.” I looked over my shoulder and watched Crystal beam and preen.“Dan, that’s wonderful. Do you truly have a line on the Slasher or do you thinkyour confidential informant is just another bozo trying to get their hands onthat reward?”“No bozo, Sadie. Not this time. Is it as bad as the papers say up there?”“This town has gone bananas. People are running around forming posses, they’reout there buying guns and anti-slasher devices; coeds are fleeing the area bythe thousands. The media has everyone quaking with terror. It’s good that peopleare staying alert but we could use some help. Can you give me a name and addressfor the killer?”I glanced over at Crystal and shot her a grin. “Yeah Sadie, I’ve got a solidline on your Slasher, but tell me, what’s the poop on the reward?”Sadie Fennel clucked her tongue at me over the miles. “Dan, think of the publicsafety first. The rewards will all follow in good time. We are really in a jamup here, young girls are being murdered almost hourly and the killer is slicingoff their heads…and molesting their other parts.”“Listen up, Sadie. Fuck you and your jams way up there in Ivory Tower Town. I’min a wad of jams every day down here in Miami. You can’t believe the jams that Iget into…purloined corpses, missing virgins, fly-blown hookers and thatscreaming faggot Beau Morris mincing all over my city running after the SexBeasts. You think you got problems? I get chopped coed for breakfast down heretwo or three times any given month. So what do you think about that?”“We’re just a small town, Dan. We’ve got small town problems. Date rape, pantyraids, peeping toms and the occasional traffic ticket thrown in to keep mehopping. Nobody up here knows the first thing about catching a Slasher; ourhomicide bureau couldn’t catch a cold on a wet day in January. I wish you’d comeup here and help us; I’ll make it worth your while; I’ll owe you a big one!”“Fifty big ones and your ass, Fennel. That’s what I want!”“My ass! What?! Kelly, you can’t be serious!”“As a heart attack in deep water, lady. You can put the fifty G’s in an escrowaccount pending an arrest. The ass will be on call at my convenience.”“I’ve heard about what a lousy bastard you are, Kelly, and this certainlyconfirms it. The detective magazines are full of your rotten exploits and I’veread about them all. I remember what you did to the poor misguided child, JaniceIrwin.”“What was it that you heard, Sadie?”“That you arrested her illegally and then cut the poor girl a deal that got heran appointment with the Delaware hangman. And as if that wasn’t enough, then youtook a fourteen year old female juvenile delinquent up to the Delaware women’spenitentiary to watch Janice Irwin dance. That’s disgusting!”“You ought not to dwell on the sordid side of life, Sadie. The JD needed somevisions of what a future in crime can do for a lady…besides, she is a chickiewho likes to watch. She’d go watch anything unusual; last week she asked me totake her to a traveling freak show to see a two-headed calf. Now she’s beencalling the squad room and asking me to take her up to Starke to watch the BlackWidow fry on Old Sparky. The kid’s a real comer.”“You’re insane, Kelly; that’s the most disgusting thing I’ve ever heard!”“That’s the same thing Pauline Tilly said about Killer Fiction. I don’t know, Isort of liked it - reminded me of your so-called Gainesville Slasher.”I heard Sadie Fennel gasp. “Who told you about that? It’s secret information!How could you know about the Killer Fiction connection unless you talked to thekiller or unless…oh my God, I can’t believe it!”I heard Fennel screaming into the receiver. The stress was catching up to her.“What are you shrieking about, Fennel? Get control of yourself; explain thisKiller Fiction connection business to me right now.”“How did you get ahold of that book, Kelly?”“Our department has a copy we’ve been passing around. I heard they were using itat the FBI Academy too. As a text.”Sadie Fennel sobbed into the telephone receiver. “It’s required reading for theMurder 101 course at the University. Or at least it was until this broke out.Those books are disgusting and pornographic, just like Pauline Tilly said! Anddecent citizens are going to rise up and do something about it or I’ll turn inmy badge!”“This is America, Sadie. You can’t stop a book from being published.”“This book is different! That killer tore pages out of it and laid them on thegutted corpses of the girls. The Slasher is copycatting the crimes in that awfulbook. A task force is drawing up murder charges against the author right now.It’s all his fault! We’re going to see him burn. You’ll see.”Sadie Fennel’s revelations convinced me that the Butcher had returned, this timeknown as the Gainesville Slasher. “Everybody knows that GJ Schaefer is aworld-class pervert, but you can’t charge a man with murder for writing dirtystories! Get real, Fennel!”Sadie screamed into the phone. “We can and we will! These murders are allSchaefer’s fault. He put them in his book and now they have come to life. Ahomicidal maniac got ahold of it and now look at what happened. Everyone isupset. Rush week at the university is ruined. The entire economy of Gainesvilleis a mess and it’s all because of that beast Schaefer and his horrible book!”“Hey, the funeral directors will be making out. Look to the bright side.”“What! What? That’s disgusting! You call yourself a police officer? I can’tbelieve you would say that!”“I deal in realities, kid. Now how about the fifty grand? Do we have a deal ornot?” I listened to the sobs of the flustered police hen trying to get hertattered emotions under control.She growled like a cat preparing to deal the death blow to a worn out mouse.“There is no reward. We just put that information into the tabloid so thatpeople would call up and give us information. It’s perfectly ethical. Alegitimate law enforcement tool. We’ve got a lot of leads already. An arrest iseminent. We have suspects…more than one if you really must know….” Her voicetrailed off in a hopeless whine.“Call me when you get the cash lined up,” I said, and hung up. I turned toCrystal. “Let that be a lesson to you, babes, never trust a damned cop. Theylie. You can never believe a thing they say, especially when money is involved.”Crystal looked forlorn; flopped down on the sofa and began thumbing throughShocking Romance, another Expose Galaxy tabloid.I peered over her shoulder and eyed the story headline. It read: Romeo LawyerSteals Client’s Wife; Killer Screams Frame-up!I chuckled. “I shouldn’t be letting you fill your innocent mind with all thatlurid trash, honey. Those tabloid writers make up those stories to sell theirstupid magazines. That story you’re reading there is a good example. It gives agirl like yourself a distorted sense of reality and God knows I’ve been tryingto keep your feet on the ground and teach you what is going on in the city andthe world.”Crystal grunted. She kept reading.“You know, Crystal, the Bar Association would never allow a lawyer to violatelegal ethics by marrying a client’s wife after representing him in a trial. It’scalled a conflict of interest, moral leprosy and a few other things. Decentpeople would never tolerate it going on in their community.”Crystal huffed and snorted. “Dan, this story was written by StarGlow Stuart!She’s my very most fave writer and I’m her number one fan. She’d never lie! Andthis story is so romantic! Listen. This poor young girl was married to adepraved cultist who was a corpse molester, but the police caught up with himand arrested him with human body parts under his bed. The defense lawyer says hehad a hopeless case because all the details of the murders and this other grossstuff was written down in his diary and hidden in a closet, but the cops foundthat too. The lawyer really did try hard to defend him because he felt sorry forthe beautiful young girl who was under the evil spell of the sex ghoul. Thenduring the trial the lawyer and the young girl fell in love. The jury convictedthe villain and the judge him sent to prison forever. The evil spell was brokenand the lawyer married the girl and they lived happily ever after! But now theghoul is claiming that the lawyer framed him because the lawyer was after hiswife. Isn’t that interesting? I love to read these true romances!”“It’s all media bullshit, Kid. It damn sure doesn’t happen that way in reallife. There are ethical safeguards against it. If it really happened the waythat nut case StarGlow has it written, then that lawyer and his bimbo would beout on the street collecting tin cans for recycling. That’s the way it happensin real life, and don’t you be forgetting it, Missy.”“How can they have safeguards against true love, Dan?”I had to admit that I didn’t have the answer for that one so I let it slide. Ijust stroked the chestnut tresses of the panting teenage romantic avidlyscanning the doings of the lustful lawyer and his little princess. I imaginedStarGlow creeping through the newspaper morgues; slashing away at genteelreputations with her pen; whirling through the public records and probing intoprivate secrets with her customary elán.I remembered how her pink lace panties peeked out from under her Oleg Cassinisuit as she sprawled unconscious on the carpet outside my front door, adelirious vision. And then this light bulb blinked on inside my head.I walked over to the telephone, leaving Crystal to sigh over her silly romancestories. I dialed direct to Expose Galaxy’s central offices in Atlanta. I gavetheir operator the number of StarGlow’s extension and she patched me through.StarGlow picked up her phone on the first ring. A plus for her. “DarkPrincehere,” I announced.StarGlow squealed with obvious delight at the sound of my voice. “Dirty Dan, youold android, what have you found out for me today?”“The identity of the Gainesville Slasher.”I heard the telephone fall to the floor as StarGlow toppled off her chair in adead faint. The Exposé Galaxy paid well for their exclusives and I had aparticular reputation for reliability with Mistress StarGlow. I made her anoffer that she and her publishers couldn’t refuse - not only would StarGlow havethe exclusive identity of the Gainesville Slasher.I would also use my considerable influence with Pauline Tilly to get the Queenof the Exposé Galaxy a rare and much coveted interview with GJ Schaefer, thereclusive author of Killer Fiction, who claimed to have crucial insideinformation on the moldering bones of little Adam Walsh, whose severed head hadbeen found floating in a South Florida canal…information he had obtained fromhis cellmate, the arch-fiend Ottis Toole, whose granny brought him up to be theDevil’s Child, and who joined Henry Lee Lucas on his nonstop killing spree. Whoknows what else Schaefer might tell us?There were arrangements to be made, people to lean on, and markers to becollected. And of course I’d have to pay another call on Schaefer. But for fiftygrand I’d do it all quickly and well.The check was Fedexed to me the next morning. StarGlow was ecstatic; SadieFennel was livid.And the Butcher was gone - he must have fled Gainesville for his lair in theimpenetrable Florida swamps. No doubt he would soon emerge again to terrorizethe citizenry - severing heads, clipping nipples and emptying the viscera ofslaughtered coeds onto the shag carpet.Where would the slobbering maniac strike next? It was anybody’s guess and everycop in the state was in the game. I hoped it would be Miami. I had a score tosettle with the Butcher, and his ass was going to be mine, all mine.image [Images/125.jpg]TRAIL OF BUTCHERED GIRLSFind that fucking Butcher!” Chief Pork Shepherd screamed in Detective DanKelly’s face.Dan answered quickly, “Right, Chief.”“Do you have a line on the Butcher or not?”“I’ve got a line on him, all right, Chief,” Dan replied. “I’m on my way toStarke to visit the Florida State Prison. I’ll have this case cracked soon.”“If you don’t come back with the name of the Butcher, don’t come back at all,”Shepherd screamed, “Do you hear me, Kelly? Get out! Get out of my goddamnoffice!” Dan turned on his heel, closing the door behind him.The Chief was having a bad day. Another couple of kids had been found slashed todeath out at the University of Miami, and it had him upset. Reporters from theMiami Herald were asking questions he couldn’t answer, and their bullshitdetectors were flashing like Geiger counters at the core of an atomic powerplant. It was enough to give the Chief ulcers. Dan sympathized. He hitched uphis trousers and started pounding the pavement. He was on the trail of thebutchered girls.The Butcher liked to cut up women with a big fucking knife. Dan was going tofind him and bring him in. He barreled out of the parking lot, and headed forthe Florida state turnpike for the long haul north to the bleak prison known asthe home of the most dangerous homicidal maniacs in the nation. There was onlyone man in the state who could I.D. the Butcher, and he intended to weasel thatF information out of him…one way or another.Speeding along the turnpike, Dan made a mental effort to inject himself into theincreasingly demented fantasies of the Butcher. Abandoning his own rapacious,greed-motivated personality for a moment, Dan felt reality sliding away as hedescended into the psychic pit of black madness, the deadly nightmare that wasthe mind of the Butcher.The Butcher had a name somewhere, and a face. He also had an insatiable hungerthat swelled up and exploded like a festering boil spewing pestilential murderacross the face of South Florida. Already there were over twenty gutted whoresin Wilton Manors, just south of Oakland Park.That name brought to mind the infamous Sex Beast case. This was the infamouscampus Romeo in the sixties who lured young and innocent virgins away from theirmothers, and introduced them to unspeakable acts of sexual depravity. Dan wouldnever forget the impassioned letter from one of the maniac’s traumatizedvictims, a plea for the capture of the Sex Beast. The terrorized ex-virgin hadwritten, “Oh, my God! His dick was HUGE! And his stamina!” The list of victimshad mounted to well over twenty in the Oakland Park area alone. Detective Dan Kelly sat in the interview room of the Florida State Prison andlooked into the blazing violescent eyes of the man alleged to be the greatestkiller of women in the United States of America.He felt the sweat break out on his back and soak his shirt. The sweat was fromfear and from guilt. Fear, because the man across from him tight might very welljump across the table and rip out his throat with his teeth. He had every reasonto want to do so. Dan knew this for a fact, and that is where the guilt came in.Dan was looking into the accusing eyes of a man framed for murder sixteen yearsago, Gerard John Schaefer. Dan licked his lips and started in.“Howya doin’, John?”“Fuck you, you stinking son of a bitch!” Schaefer responded with feeling.“I came up here because I need your help.”“I’ve heard that line before, Kelly,” Schaefer laughed. “I heard it when youwanted to put Allen Darrah in the chair for home invasion murders in Orlando. Iheard it when you wanted to smash the international kiddie-porn ring run byMervyn Cross. I heard it when you wanted a detailed, signed confession to theAdam Walsh murder from Ottis Toole. I’ve heard it time and again, and frankly, Idon’t give a damn.”Dan squirmed under the lashing. It was all true. Schaefer had solved the Orlandomurders; he had destroyed an international kiddie-porn ring, and he hadconvinced Toole to give a detailed confession. Dan remembered how he almostvomited as he read the details of how the boy had been kidnapped, sodomized,murdered, and his corpse eaten by the man who called himself the Devil’s Child.“Look, I know you got framed,” said Dan, “but what can I do about it? It was outof my jurisdiction.”“So what are you going to do for me this time?”Kelly shrugged. “I ought to be able to get you some contact visits with StarGlowStuart.”Schaefer leaned forward and lowered his voice. “Dan, Dan…sixteen years. I’m abig fan of the boys now, you know. Women don’t have a thing I need.”Dan didn’t know if Schaefer was pulling his leg or straightening him out abouthis bizarre sex life. It was always hard to tell.“Well, what do you want?”“I want a corrupt cop arrested.”“For what?”“For aiding and abetting a felony.”“Oh yeah? What’s his name?”“Rick Mack, up in St. Lucie County.”“So what’s your beef with him?”“Rick Baby is as corrupt as a cop can be. A two-faced, ass-licking toady ofwhoever pays his bills.”“So tell me something I don’t know.”“A couple of years ago I had a line on a fugitive from justice who used to siton the Florida Supreme Court. Using my underworld contacts, I was able tocontact him. I offered a deal to Mack. Deliver him to wherever Rick wanted him.Wanted some play as to witness protection and parole. But it didn’t work outthat way.”“Rick drop the ball or what?”“Rick’s boss pulled him off the case before we got going. Instead of going afterthe ex-judge fugitive, they told Rick to hang a couple of drug murders on me inretaliation for my snoopiness.”“Who were they?” asked Kelly with real interest.“Couple of would-be dope dealers from Iowa that came down to St. Lucie County tobuy some marijuana. Saved up a load of cash for a nice tidy buy. Rolled up andfound a seller who was with a gang of cowboys. The two ladies were fed a load ofbuckshot by a dude name of Hacksaw. Now Rick Mack tries to sell the idea that Ioffed the dope-dealing bitches.”“That wouldn’t be Goodenough and Wilcox, would it?”“That’s it.”“How do you know they were dopers?”“A cop who was sympathetic to me ran them through the computer and found a sheetfor drugs. Rick Mack tries to say they were little prom queens on a touristjunket who were massacred by the Butcher.”“Well, I know you ain’t the Butcher anyway.”“Do you? How so?”“Because the Butcher carved a couple of teenage girls down in Lauderdale just acouple of nights ago. That’s what I came up here to talk to you about.”“I’ve got a pretty solid alibi, Dan. Don’t try to pin that one on me too. Everyfucking time a bone is found in the state of Florida, they start screaming myname.”“Look, John, I’ll take a swing past this Rick character. Promise. I want a namefrom you, that’s all. Just a name. I’ll give you the facts. You give me a nameto go with them. OK? Deal?”“So we’re all set on Rick Mack?”“No problem. Cop’s honor,” Kelly swore, raising his right hand with a nod.Schaefer gave a mirthless laugh and said, “Run it past me, Danno.” His voice wascold as penitentiary steel.Kelly suppressed a shiver and said, “This guy I’m looking for calls himselfJerry. Worked at a packing plant and came from the Rock. I figured that wasRaiford prison. Huge guy, looks like Hoss Cartwright on TV. That’s all I’vegot.”Schaefer looked at his gold Patek Philippe watch. “It’s 3:00 P.M., Kelly. I wantyour ass back here at midnight. I’ll let you know then if I can get you a name.”Dan got up and left. The new moon cast a faint, eerie glow over the fields surrounding the FloridaState Prison. It was 11:30 P.M. Dan stood at the main gate and listened to theinhuman howling floating across the bleak landscape with the moonlight. He wasawed; never in his life had he heard anything like it. He turned to the fat,slack-lipped gate guard and asked, “What’s all that screaming about?”The gate guard spat a stream of tobacco juice and speculated on the nature ofconvicts. “Them’s the screams of the condemned to death. They do holler a tad, Iadmit that. Decent folk drive past and they hear that noise and wonder, and thenthey forget it. Ain’t no money in recollecting it.”“Must be the niggers doing it.”“Some say it’s the niggers, but I’ve been on this gate for 21 years, and itain’t no racial matter a’tall. Them that howl are the living dead. Them howlshave a certain tone to ‘em and if you study on it, you can pick up the notes.You catch that deep bellow? That’s your nigger howl there. The higher-pitchedones? That’s the white.”Dan was bemused. “That one there sure sounded like a woman.”“Them high-squealers is the queens.” The guard spat again, and the tobacco juicedribbled down his chin, staining his police shirt with the shiny badge. “True,that one did sound a bit like a woman. But ain’t no real women in there now,though, not at the moment.”“At the moment?”“Oh, we get ‘em now and then. We kill ‘em here. Them as is condemned for deathby law. Can you see that building stuck out a bit therein the dark?”Dan squinted, nodded.“Well, that’s where we kill ‘em. Death chamber’s in there. We got over 300 menin there waiting. That’s them howling. Women, they are more on the order ofshriekers and squealers. The bucks, they bellow.”“Is it always this bad?”“Oh, it’s a study on a warm night. The full moon stirs ‘em up. You won’t find nosane person in there. All raving murderous maniacs. It’s a wonder the citizenstolerate it. Ought to execute the lot of ‘em. My preacher was saying so atmeeting only this past Sunday.”“You ever hear of Schaefer?” Dan ventured.“Schaefer, sure,” The guard laughed. “I read all about him in my detectivemagazines. Some correctional officers read pornographic trash like Playboy orPenthouse that show them naked women. Not me. I read magazines that will help mein my work, like Shocking Detective and the new one, Serial Killers. I like toread them stories by StarGlow Stuart.”image [Images/129.jpg]“Yeah, she’s pretty good. Friend of mine.”“Really? She as good looking as her pictures?”“Better, matter of fact. But what about Schaefer?”“I do recollect when Schaefer was in every detective magazine in the country.Made the cover on most of ‘em. There was pictures of his victims. The one Irecall best was a pretty girl he hung up. Showed her photo. Flies crawling onher. Said he hung her up to die. Odd way to do a murder, I thought then; I stilldo.”“I remember that case,” Kelly nodded. “That was in my jurisdiction.”“Then there was that business about him eating them young girls. Fried them in askillet, I reckon. Purty little young-uns. Peggy and Wendy, I believe was thenames. Gutted ‘em like little piglets. Claimed they were right tasty too.”“They said that in the magazine?”“Them detective books ain’t gonna print no lies, now.” The guard pulled a longface. “They’d get sued for libel if they did, wouldn’t they?”“Fuck if I know. I ain’t no lawyer, but what about Schaefer?”“Can’t say that Schaefer is a bad sort. A bit of a jailhouse lawyer, callshimself the historian of the chain gang. Says he writes books, but he’s probablylying.”Dan glanced at his twelve-dollar Timex. “I’d better get on in there and seehim.”“You’re cleared.”“Why did you have me come down here at midnight?” Dan asked the gloweringconvict. “It wasn’t exactly easy to get clearance.”“I told you to come at midnight because now the Unit is on lock-down. The ratscan’t see us up here talking.”“So did you find out anything?”“I’ll talk, you listen.”So Dan sat listened as the convict told him the score.“The name of the Butcher is Jerry Michael Squires. Guy’s a dead ringer for HossCartwright, and he has a bad attitude about whores, due to the clap he got fromone years ago. He pulled 16 years on a murder rap he claims he didn’t commit. Heworked the packing plant killing floor at the Rock. He cut the head off anewcock name of Wilson who was put in a 20-man cell that was full. Swede Rankinwas the cell boss. He took the heat, but Squires cut off the kid’s head andpushed it out the bean hole. Squires is married to a pussy boy name of RayDonato, a Cuban punk out of Tampa.”“So he hit Gainesville and Miami. You think he’s headed for Tampa?”“He was heading for Tampa when he got out. But his main job, the one he talksabout the most, is to kidnap Christine Evert, the tennis girl. He said he’sgonna kidnap her, ask for five million dollars ransom, and cut little hunks outof her and mail them in to Andy Mills until he pays up.”“Chris Evert is at the Polo Club in Boca. Maybe Squires is headed that way.”“That’s what the snitches tell me. Could be true, could be bullshit. Willie theWeasel sent him to see two French experts from his string, and the whores ain’twrote him since. Willie wants his money. If Squires got near those whores,they’re probably diced meat by now. Jerry always carries a blade in his rightboot. It’s his trademark.”“That was your trademark, too, wasn’t it, John?”Schaefer stood up. “This interview is over. Now get out of my prison.”“Your prison?” Dirty Dan was dumbfounded. “What are you talking about?”“It’s like this, Danno. This is a public institution, paid for by taxpayers, runby public servants, I’m the taxpayer, you’re the public servant, I’m the public,you serve me. You are the one who comes slinking in here asking favors. I livehere. This is my home. And I want you to get the fuck out. Now.”There was no arguing with the logic of the man with the blazing eyes said to bethe top killer in the country. Schaefer spat on the polished floor as he watchedDirty Dan leave, then called for the shiteater to walk him back to his cell.It was a new moon, but the howlers were going at it full tilt. You’d think themoon was full."},{"pageContent":"STARKE STORIESimage [Images/131.jpg]MY TICKET TO THE SOCIETY OF FIENDSThe story in the Palm Beach Post on May 13, 1973 was about six pages long. Thewhole paper was practically devoted to it. That was the story Ted Bundy saw.So he comes up to me and says, “I saw your face on the front page. I read thestory.” Turns out I am a hero to Bundy. You cannot imagine how I felt having thefamous fiend in awe of me. But I was billed at one time on the front pages ofnewspapers and detective magazines as “The Greatest Mass Murderer of Women ThisCentury,” and that is no small statement. It’s a real good ticket into theSociety of Fiends.But I don’t brag. People say, “There’s the great mass murderer,” and I smile andsay, “Oh, you read the papers, huh?”He’d heard about the death diary that I was supposed to have kept. The thing isa myth made up by the state’s attorney, but Ted believed it existed, so I’d tellhim, “Oh yeah, that. Well, I never could keep track unless I kept a record andphotos. The cops got over a hundred photos plus the diary.” This would reallyget his interest.My problem with Bundy, if you could call it a problem, was that he had a certainfascination with my own case. Any time I get questions about Bundy, I try to Tdodge them because I don’t want people to say I’m telling tales which cannot bechecked for verity. But essentially what the connection amounted to was that hewanted to outscore me. He had been reading everything he could get his hands onabout me—most of which was complete nonsense. He was enchanted by all that,absolutely fascinated. He believed it all without question, and every time we’dbe around together in a one-on-one situation, he’d be asking me for details onmemorable kills…and then he’d tell me details about his own adventures.One of Ted’s first questions to me was about the number of victims I was allegedto have. He came right out and asked me about it—a very declassé move inhere—and what could I say? My score is zero? I let him know in no uncertainterms that he was small time by comparison to me. He was really deflated butthen he was in awe of me. Big smile every time I saw him.I played it just a little aloof. I told him I had 34 kills confirmed in themedia, and he said he had more confirmed than that. Then I’d go, “Yeah, but Iworked three continents, plus a few trips to Canada.”And he’d go, “So you have some unconfirmed.” And I’d go, “Private graveyards,you’ve seen it all in print. You’ve heard about them.” Ted: Yeah, but how many would you say?Me: You think I count them up on a tally card?Ted: I was wondering who got the most.Me: You and the FBI, Pal.Ted: Gimme a round figure.Me: OK. Figure I’m working this deal since 1963 and my last confirmed job was in1973, so that’s ten active years. I had me a nice sporty little boat. Cutelittle tourist girl hops in. Run her back in the mangroves and in less than twominutes she’s got a mooring line tied around her neck, flopping on the deck likea flounder and peeing in her sunsuit. Mess around a little, then run her offshore and deep six her with a cinder block around her ankles.Ted: (Nods knowingly.)Me: Figure 28 confirmed kills in South Florida alone, plus my collection ofheads.Ted: Heads?Me: Right. You obviously read about that.Ted: I think I did.Me: Well, first I started out with a little memento, like a ring or earring orbracelet. Cops got over a hundred pieces, so what does that indicate? They alsogot my photo collection, maybe 40 or 50 women, same as Glatman. Take her out inthe woods, peel her down, photograph her, mess around, then do her. Of course, Ialways did them first, then took pictures. Confirmed. Then that gets old, so Idecided to save heads. Why not? Bela Kiss put his girls in drums of alcohol,Hoess collected their panties. He had boxes of panties. Some even had littletags with the owner’s name on it. A panty freak.Ted: Hoess? (Ted didn’t know about Hoess.)Me: Yeah, but he was official. Not like us. So I figured I’d try heads.Collected two real nice ones up in West Virginia. College Cunt. Know what Imean? But they’d get wormy and smell.Ted: (Nods.)Me: So I just believe the cops when they say I’m the best this century. GreenRiver, he’s making a run on me but he’s locked into hookers. Zodiac seems tohave dropped out. You were good, Ted, but unless you can go over a hundred—wellover a hundred—you’re not in my league.Ted: Yeah, well, I appreciate you telling me, Jerry. Ted was very concerned with being a great killer. I’d take him down a notch bytalking to him like in this dialogue. It’s fairly accurate in a basic way, butthere was more sniffing around the issues than I wrote.Bundy was always 100% respectful of me. I treated him as a supplicant, whileothers were hanging on his every word. He told me he had tried to copy my killsthat he’d read about in crime tabloids. One tabloid ran a photo of a blonde anda brunette I’d allegedly killed, and so he tried to do a copycat. That wouldhave been around July, 1973. He went out to some park in Washington and grabbedhim a long-haired blonde like Susan Place, the victim he saw in the tabloid. Hecaught her in the morning and killed her, then went back in the afternoon andhunted a brunette in a black bikini to copycat Georgia Jessup, who was shown inan alluring black swimsuit. He selected the one he wanted and waited for her togo to the restroom, and then caught her on the way to the toilet. He took herwhere he killed the first girl and strangled her too. When he got the cordaround her neck and pulled it taut she went off like a rocket. He told me thathe’ d put the seat of the VW as far forward as possible so the woman’s kneeswould be jammed up under the dash. A large woman would be so cramped shecouldn’t move, but this one gal was on the small side and as soon as he yankedthe cord she popped up and was half over the back seat. Her legs weren’t tiedand she was kicking so hard Ted thought she was going to kick out thewindscreen. After that he’d tie the ankles, shove the seat full forward, thenget in the back and get down to business.He was annoyed that she crapped when he strangled her, and said he should havegrabbed her coming out of the restroom instead of on her way to it. I used Ted’sstory about that kill when I described Cattle Kate in my story “Whores.”Both the women figured he had rape in mind. The blonde was some sort of socialworker who promised she’d help him if he’d let her go. The brunette was sobbingand begging to be let go because of her widowed mother or something. Ted killedboth on the same day, and he told me they were chosen because they looked likePlace and Jessup.He was simply trying to impress me with his various kills. I paid attentionbecause it was fascinating to me what he had to say. I think a lot of peoplewere fascinated by what he said, and I’m sure that the police are not revealingeverything he told them. I’d make up a story and tell him, and then he’d tell mestuff like how he carried on with the dead women in Washington. He’d pretty themup with fresh make-up before the ghouling began.He wasn’t familiar with the basic chemistry of human putrefaction. I’d been ahunter, so I know how to prevent spoilage of meat in the field. I’d listen tohim whine about how a girl would turn rotten on him so fast, then I’d clue himin on how to keep her fresh as long as possible. I told him to string the girlup by the ankles and cut off her head to exsanguinate her. Blood rots fast, andso do brains. So it’s best to cut off the head and drain the blood. He wanted toknow what I’d do with the head, and I said I’d put it on a stick so she couldwatch me make love to her body. He’d almost come in his shorts listening to thisstuff.Ted enjoyed killing women and experimented with different types ofstrangulation. He’d tie a cord around the captive’s neck and then slip a lengthof doweling rod under the cord and begin to turn it slowly until the victim wasstrangled to death. He could control the pressure and would squeeze the windpipeclosed, take the victim to the verge of death, then release the pressure. What Ifound most interesting was his observation that when he would do this thevictim’s eyes would become glassy and vacant. She would be alive and breathing,but the life force would somehow be gone. As if there was a body but lacking asoul. I figured it was simply a catatonic reaction, but Ted liked to think hehad an animated corpse to play with. He progressed to a point where he wouldkill the woman while he was fucking her. He told me that the Leach girl, who wastwelve or thirteen years old, couldn’t take his cock so he rolled her over facedown and went up her butt with his dick while strangling her with a belt.Ted was very sexually perverse. No way you could tell him that the lady didn’tget off on having her neck wrung, because he’d tell you that the girls hestrangled would have juicy slick panties when he finished with them. I knew itwas bullshit because from reading commission reports on capital punishment, Ilearned that either gender will orgasm when executed by strangulation, and it’ssimply brain dysfunction, not a pleasure response.All the years we were here together I probably only talked to him a total of tento twelve hours, but he’d tell me stuff he would never tell other people—likeabout his car. We both had VW bugs and he wanted to know if I ever did anykilling in my car, because he said the girls would always pee on the seat whenhe was killing them and it left a stale urine stink in his car.There were times when he wouldn’t even have the seat in his car. He said thecops were speculating that removing the seat was part of his trap, or that hewas trying to destroy evidence. But it was just because the seat was beingcleaned and aired to get the pissy smell out of the upholstery. I’d say, “Ihated to do them in the car and get a lake of piss on the floor,” and he’d say,“Yeah, I always had to clean the car when I did one inside.”I told him I used a plastic seatcover on the death seat, and spread newspapersover the back floormat so the pee would run off the seat onto the paper, whichcould be tossed away wet. He thought that was brilliant. And I’d simply tell himthat such small things are what separate amateurs like himself from pros likeme. He couldn’t get enough of conversation like that. It was like he felt I knewfor sure there was a real boring side to Death work, and it wasn’t all ragingsexual release, as the media likes to portray it.I got on fine with Ted. He’d believe anything I’d say. He was keen to meet mebecause he’d read all the stories in the magazines and detective books saying Iwas The Best. It does no good to deny it. Denial is expected, so when confrontedwith someone like Ted—a fiend who is measuring you up as the top gun—your bestplay is the modest insinuation that everything written was completely true andthere’s a lot more besides.DEATH HOUSE SCREAMSThey call it the Death House because its purpose is human slaughter.From 1972 until executions started up again in 1979, the Death House was like alittle museum. Wardens would invite the budding social scientists from theUniversity for this little tour. The climax was the trek down into the bowels ofthe death house, to the electric chair. The coeds plunked their cute butts intothe chair while their pals snapped pictures and made zzzzz noises. It was aregular hoot, the most popular social science field trip. Best of all was whenthe little ladies got to meet real live criminal fiends: Murf-the-Surf, theCatch-Me Killer, and myself. More feral types like Ted Bundy were not allowed tomingle with the dollies.In May 1979 all that changed forever, and it was the fault of one man—JohnSpenkelink. “Spink,” as we called him, was a prison punk, a faggot—a product ofthe correctional system who couldn’t quite get his sexual identity straight.He’d swish, but though he didn’t mince or go about with a limp wrist, there wasno doubt in your mind that he was a sissy.Spink had shot a man in a Tallahassee motel room—an ex-con known to be a“jocker”—a bull faggot. To hear Spink tell it, the jocker had “ripped off hisass” (raped him) so Spink shot him. Mind you, Spink was not criticized for thisamongst his peers. Had Spink done his murder in prison, he’d have just told theprison inspector that the jocker ripped off his ass so he killed him. He’d doninety days in the Hole and that’d be the end of it. After all, prisoninvestigators know what a young punk has to deal with. Jocker comes into thecell with a hard-on and says: “Put blood on my face or shit on my dick.” Thepunk fights or he drops his pants and bends over. Spink had lived like that manya year in prison, and since he was a bit of a femme, his asshole was about likethe entrance to the Holland tunnel. Maybe it still wasn’t big enough.Spink believed he had done the right thing shooting the rapist, so when the D.A.offered him a plea to Murder II he turned it down. Big mistake. He went totrial, and the good citizens of Leon County found him guilty of premeditatedmurder, which it was, and sent the no-good mad-dog murdering queer to Death Row,which was where he was on May 25, 1979, the day he loused things up for the restof us with the tour chicks.Day dawned and there across the road from the prison were the usual fields fullof protesters and execution groupies. One field for anti-CP, another for thosewho enjoy the vicarious thrill of a good electrocution. Vendors abound: friedmeat, drinks, souvenir T-shirts, miniature electric chairs that light up whenyou flip a switch.We were looking out the windows at the show across the street. Signs on sticks,posters going up and down, everybody chanting and howling. Big party rollingalong. That’s when we heard the scream. It came rolling up the stairwell andunder the door, and you just knew something godawful was happening.In prison you hear a lot of screams. The one we heard was a scream of outrage,not a death scream. Not the kind you hear when someone gets a shank in his gutsand the killer rips open his victim’s belly and his soul goes screaming off toHell. It wasn’t like that at all.We all looked at each other. Nobody had to say, “What’s that?” The question wasin everybody’s eyes. Even the old cons who’d been death house orderlies back inthe sixties couldn’t get a handle on that scream. We’d all heard the yarns theold timers would spin over a cigarette and a cup of joe. Good stories. You hadto listen because the tales would sort of reach over and take you by the throat,or hit you like a guard’s sap upside your head.We heard of the men who spit in death’s eye. And the craven baby-rapers who’dpiss their pants and faint at the sight of Old Sparky on the upraised dais, allfestooned with leather straps and buckles to hold them steady while they “ridethe lightning.”They call it the three-minute electric enema: 2800 volts of blazing hellfiresmack through your brain down your spine and out your leg. The executioner givesyou that first pop of 2800 volts; it raises you right off the chair to strainagainst the straps; shit be slithering out your asshole like a big brown eel,eyeballs be hanging out on your cheeks, brain be boiling in your skull. Then theexecutioner draws back a touch and takes the current down to 1600 volts. Setsyou smack down in your own slop. Then he runs it up the scale to 2800 again tillyour flesh smokes, slobber and drool be oozing, blood be running out your nose,your trousers be soaked in piss and semen. Cuts the current and you slump in thestraps. Dead meat. Fried in your own shit.We soon found out the story of Spink’s death house scream. What infuriated Spinkwas the unexpected way the State violated his body.Ladies of the media had been invited to the execution of Brother Spink. ERAtime. Can’t be prejudiced against women at executions; so here they come. Alldolled up in their fancy go-to-execution ensembles, their sober skirts andblouses. Fancy hairdos, cheeks rouged, lips glossed, eyes shadowed, blackstockings—nice touch there. We can all imagine the black silk panties ridingtight against the perfumed cunt. Oh yes. Spectacles and notebooks and gold pens.Lordy, Lordy, Lordy! One old timer comments that the fancy ladies will soon beheaving up their home fries in the discreetly provided vomit bags.The gallant gentlemen of the FSP administration, gracious fellows that they be,had decided that pretty media ladies ought not to be subjected to the baserelements of criminal execution. No unpleasant manure odors should offend thosepatrician nostrils, and urine on electrodes turns to noxious steam.So to keep the execution tidy, the death strap squad held Spink down while amedical orderly stuffed cotton batting up his backside. Not just a few littlecotton balls either. And when the orderly finished that unsavory task, he loopeda surgical ligature around the base of Spink’s penis and tied it nice and tight.Naturally the sissy screamed. Wouldn’t you?His scream when they crammed his asshole was so terrible that he went to thechair gagged. Prison Admin caught hell in the papers about the “brutality.”But at least Spink didn’t scream in front of the ladies.The medical orderlies have got it down to a science now. Nobody screams whenthey get packed; they gag them first. After the business is concluded the gagcomes off and he’s hustled into the electric chair. People couldn’t understandwhy Ted Bundy seemed a little unsteady on his feet there at the end. Maybe theyshorted him on the Vaseline, who knows?image [Images/137.jpg]From midnight until they pulled the switch on Ted, the prison grapevine wasbuzzing with his every word, his every movement and attitude. All considered,Ted got good marks.The all-time high for brass goes to Art Goode, who told the press his onlyregret was that he couldn’t have a naked little boy sitting in his lap there inthe chair. Truly fiendish. I knew little Art well. One of the nastiestpsychopathic child killers imaginable. He was radiant with evil. Even on theRow, people shunned him like the plague. Bundy was a bore compared to Goode, sofar as sheer evil is concerned.Miss Andrea Jackson, the Queen of Florida’s Death Row, is scheduled to burnsoon. They have a nice roomy cell right behind the Central Control Station allready for her. I’ve been in the women’s death cell, swept it out. I’ve sat onthe press bench where the women are held down for “preparation.” Up behindControl is the infamous seatless toilet where they make the condemned womansquat before they take her down that polished, spotless runway for her date withOld Sparky. As she nears the door to the Death Cell, all eyes will be on her—butit will be the eyes of her peers, not the public. She’ll be making chain ganghistory and every convict in the system will hear her legacy: the tale of howshe went down the mainline.The guards are talking southern fried cunt. Last night they told me they’rebringing in three death strap matrons to handle Andrea. The medical tech islaying in an extra box of cotton for Miss Double Barrel. The cons are gonnawatch her make her last mile, and she won’t be brutally gagged. We’ll all get tolisten to her screams.EARLY RELEASEThe bus crawled through the darkening Florida countryside, the soft hum ofrubber on macadam floating up from under the wheels.I was sitting in the back of the thing feeling edgy and impatient, smoking myRIP and contemplating the coming evening. I’d done sixteen years in the slam,straight up. One day the fucking warden says, “Pack your shit, Boy, you’re beingturned out. Early release. Prisons are full. Gotta push some of you oldtimersout, got too many newcocks coming in.”I packed my shit. It fit in the front pocket of my jeans. They gave me a hundredT bucks and offered me a bus ticket to any city in Florida. I picked Tampa. Whatthe fuck? One place is the same as another, ain’t it?I reached down and stroked the hilt of my shank. It was jammed in my bootconvict style. I’d feel naked without it. In prison a man learns to rely onhimself and the comforting presence of cold steel next to his leg on a hotsummer night.My shank had saved my ass more than once from the wolf packs of asshole banditsthat prey on the weak after lights out. Only the fittest survive the brutalityof prison with their manhood intact.The only other person I knew on the Trailways was a baby-faced punk from FloridaState Prison at Starke, known among the criminal brotherhood as the East Unit,or just the Unit. There is no tougher prison in the U.S. of A.—only FolsomPrison in California comes close in terms of murderous reputation. The onlyquestion in my mind was whether the slender boy with the shaved legs was afuckboy or a killer queen. The kid had himself a copy of Hustler, and wassipping liquor from a bottle concealed in a paper bag. I was feeling high withfreedom and I needed to bat the breeze a bit.I leaned over toward the punk and gave him a wolfish grin.“Hey, boy. Whatcha got there inside that tote sack? Think I can’t smellfree-world hooch when it’s uncorked?”The punk had thick light-brown hair; he glanced up and over, blinking his wateryno-color eyes. They were white trash convict eyes: guarded, fearful, ancient.Eyes that had known pain, and expected to know it again. The eyes of a prisonfuck-boy. His answer was an apology.“Sorry. I didn’t catch what you said.”“I said, I want to know what’s in that fucking sack you’re sucking on, kid.”The punk shifted in his seat, quickly looked around, then offered me a sly,shieating smile. “This here is Jim Beam Whiskey. Scored it right at Big BadDaddy’s Lounge in Starke. Five finger discount.”“Stole it?”“I gave that lonely little feller a new home, is all,” he drawled in hiscracker, grit-sucking voice. “He was just sitting there with nobody paying him alick of attention, so I boosted him up under my arm and here he is. Besides,tastes better when you steal it.”“Think so?”“Sure. Wanna try a little snort?”“Fuckin-A on that, kid.”The wheels squeaked and hummed along the cement pavement, the tropicalcountryside oozed past. It was so green—a wondrous world of a million differentshades of green after sixteen years of solid gray. I took up the bag, wiped theneck of the bottle with my hand and belted down a healthy slug.“That’s damn fine shit there. Beats plum wine all to hell and gone. Fiery. Setsthe sparks to jumping, don’t it?”“You betcha,” the punk said.“Got me some Bar-b-Cue corn chips here. Got ’em at the Kash-n-Karry store.Walked right into the little joint. Ten thousand kinds of shit to choose from. Ididn’t know what to do. It made me nervous seeing all that stuff, so I grabbedthe first sack on the rack and hauled ass. Paid my kash; and karried the shitaway, just like it said up there on the sign. Little girl at the money takingplace up front had tits out front like Jane Fonda in Barbarella. I stared rightat ’em. She smelt like a whore. I liked to skeeted in my drawers.” I passed thebottle back to him, my eyes automatically scanning for a guard as I made thepass.“I’ll slide on the munchies, Oldcock. I’d probably just puke those corn chipsup. I’m aiming to get drunk.” He took another pull on his bottle and gave me agrin. His eyes were already slightly tinged with crimson from the powerful 90proof hooch. Niggers had been at him. It was in his eyes; it came off him like abad case of B.O. He’d be a walking death factory full of AIDS. I knew that for afact. Mess with a pussy-boy in the joint and it’s like Russian Roulette. Hell,play Russian Roulette with a pistol, your odds are safer. I was looking at awalking dead man. I motioned to the magazine open on his lap.“You read that pervo shit or just look at the pictures? That Larry Flynt is thesickest fucker that ever put out a skin rag; I never have understood his brandof humor.”The punk picked up the magazine and set it on his knee, leaving me to see hisdick stuck up like a flagpole. He opened the rag to the centerfold where abare-assed lady was showing her Vaseline-slickened tunnel of love. The punk bentover and ran his tongue over the page, leaving a wet trail between the model’slegs. He made a growl like a hound dog and said, “I like it when the girliesshow the pink. Hustler gets my blood moving around, heats me up, ya know: Idon’t read it—I don’t look at the cartoons. I just stare at those titties andthose gorgeous hairy cunts and jack my dick. Doesn’t everyone? Ain’t that thereason they show them in the fucking thing?”I grinned back at him, wondering what an asshole bandit would see in a nakedwhore. Maybe the same as anyone else; who can tell what goes on in a faggot’stwisted mind? I’d been around them for sixteen years straight now, and nevercould figure them out. “So it heats you up and now you’re hot stuff.”The punk nodded agreeably and took another pull on the bottle.I snapped my finger at him and he quickly handed the jug back my way. “Here yougo,” he said. Nice polite kid.I drank his whiskey, felt it burn down inside me. It brightened me up, made memore aware of myself. Shit. Maybe stolen booze was better. I closed my eyes fora minute. Felt the sonorous hum of the bus all around me. Heard the snick-snackof the tires snapping across the expansion cracks in the rural highway. It was apleasant sound. I was tense. I needed to ease up, relax a little. Too manychanges too fast. I wasn’t used to it. Riding this fucking bus with no meshwelded over the windows was making me nervous. I realized I could simply throwopen the window and leap out. I had a crazy fleeting urge to do just that. I sawthe big headlines: Man Dies Jumping From Window of Moving Bus. Nobody would everknow why. It would be another unsolved mystery. I smiled at the thought.I opened my eyes again, glanced at the kid. His eyes stared at nothing. He wasleaning back against the bus seat, his hand playing with his dick. He smiled ina self-contained, distant manner at visions only he could see. He scratched athis balls like a whipped cur. I wondered if he was insane. I decided to chat himup and see what sort of worms came to the surface.“Hey, Boy.”He turned to me. “Yeah?”“They give you that early release thing?”He perked up. “Yeah. I got one of those. I earned day for day gain time workingin the broom factory. Maxed my nickel with a deuce, two months and six days. Ikept close watch on it.”“Listen. You a street queen?”“Naw. Bi.”“Niggers turn you out?”“That’s it. Turned my cracker ass out all right. First night too,” the kidsighed.“Bad shit there.”The kid giggled, a high screechy sound, his slim girlish body wriggling withgrim recollection as I passed back his little jug. He needed a hit. Drank. Wipedhis mouth with the back of his hand.“Mama Herk comes up to me. The biggest fucking nigger I ever saw in my entirelife. I figure I’m gonna die, right?” I nodded his way. “Mama Herk says, ‘WhiteBoy, I want to suck your dick.’ I figured I’d heard the fucker wrong, like hewanted me to suck his dick, but no. He wanted to suck mine. And then I had tofuck him in the ass. You believe that shit?”“Sure. Mama Herk is famous for it.”“He’s a 280 pound queen.”“I know. I’ve seen Herk. I’ve been in sixteen fucking years and you want to tellme about Mama Herk? I’ve done more time in the box than you’ve done in thejoint.” The kid gave me a worried look.“Herk turned me out, but I got protection too.”“You sucked nigger cock. Herk pimped you.”“OK, sure. That’s it.”“What’d you get for two and a half years of swallowing black cock? AIDS? Clap?”“I got half of everything.”“Niggers let you keep it?”“Yeah. Herk made them let me keep it.”“Herk would be the only one who could help a little stringbean like you holdgreen money at The Unit.”“Oh, I made plenty. I made fucking plenty.” He patted a fat roll in the frontpocket of his jeans. “It all adds up, Oldcock.”I leaned back, enjoying the heat of the booze. What it added up to was AIDS. Butfor him, not for me. “So now you are one loaded white boy.”The punk giggled again. His face was flushed and almost trusting. “I got me abig roll of green, and I’m on my way to spend it. I tell myself I earned it.That’s how I see it.”He obviously hadn’t learnt his lessons at Starke. The first one is to keep yourmouth shut—tight. The boy was no convict, not yet he wasn’t. I mulled over thenews about the fat bankroll while I squinted out the dirty window as theclapboard nigger shacks of drab, impoverished West Tampa slid past. Pest holesof crime. Nigger comes out of a place like that and prison life looks damnedgood by comparison. Steady meals, basketball, TV in the evening, some piss-assjob in a grungy prison factory, and all the white ass a coon can pump at night.Correctional officer asleep in a locked office and a dorm full of sex-crazedcriminal perverts running wild all night. Rehabilitation. I felt the wheelsswish along the pavement; the bus swayed from side to side, rocking along at asteady clip. I looked back at the Kid and said, “Yeah. You might as well enjoyit while you still got it. You get the AIDS and you’re through dealing.” Iwaited for him to argue around that one.“I know. I figure I’ve got those AIDS things swimming around up in mesomewheres. But it takes awhile for them to breed enough to where they kill you.So I’m gonna hit that fucking Tampa on the run and I’m gonna get drunk and suckme some pussy, and then maybe I’ll jump off the Sunshine Skyway Bridge rightinto Tampa Bay. Hey, I just don’t give a fuck. OK?”The punk gave me his best killer-convict-junkyard-dog stare. He looked likeGarfield. I was trying not to laugh, so I said, “You ever sucked a pussy beforein your whole damn life, Boy?”He shrugged. “Never did, I admit it. Gonna start learning how to do it today.Heard me a lot of talk in The Unit about it, told myself I ought to give it atry. Hey, I sucked plenty of cock. Why not try a pussy?”At least the kid had a sense of reality about life—or so it seemed. “How youfigure to get ahold of this pussy? You gonna walk up to some lady and say,‘Excuse me, Ma’am, I’m fresh out of prison. Heard talk of pussy-sucking while Iwas in the joint, and figured I’d like to have me a try at it; would you beagreeable to lower your drawers and let me have a lick or three?’ Or maybe youjust knock her down, put a knife to her throat and tell her to fuck or die.About like that? Out where we’re heading, Kid, is a thing called politesociety.”“Just can’t ask ’em flat out?”“Well I reckon you can ask, but it’s probably against the law to ask someone tocommit a sex crime. Solicitation for criminal acts or something. I ain’t nofucking lawyer.”“What’s the criminal part?”“Sucking pussy is a goddamned crime, Kid! It’s called oral sodomy. You’d beright back there with Mama Herk in two shakes.”“You shittin’ me? It’s a crime to suck pussy?”“No lie, Boy. It’s a crime in the State of Florida.”I put the bag to my lips and sucked some liquid fire, let it trickle down mythroat. I belched. Tasted corn chips at the back of my throat. I wondered if Icould get AIDS from the neck of a whiskey bottle. Damn depressing thought. Idismissed it. Quickly handed the Kid back his bottle.I watched him take a pull, then closed my eyes and suddenly I was back in thedarkness of the Hole. I saw the big brown sewer rats come out of the toilet holein the floor, heard the dry rustle of thousands of cockroaches, the screams ofinsane and desperate men. Seven years in the Hole. Then the bus began to slowdown. I looked out the grimy window, saw the terminal, a big sign readingTrailways. End of the fucking line.“I’m getting excited,” the Kid said.I knew what he meant. The feeling was as contagious as his AIDS. The kid closedone eye and peered into the empty bottle. “Dead soldier,” he remarked as hedropped the empty. It hit the floor with a dull clunk. An old lady gave him adirty look. Started to speak, but held her tongue.I got to my feet. Ran my hand down the side of the Kid’s face and gave it ameaningful pat. He looked at me with new eyes, asking the unspoken question. Hewas borderline drunk.“Got your heart set on sucking pussy, Kid?”He nodded, “I did. Now I’m not so sure what I want to do.”“Yeah, but I know what to do.”“You do?” the Kid brightened.“Damn right. Stick with me. I know Tampa pretty good. Worked armed robberiesalong Dale Mabry during the early seventies.”“You did?”“Sure. And I’ve got phone numbers for a pair of cunts who done time down toLowell. And you know what they fell on?”“No. What?”“Organized prostitution. I’ve got me a pair of whores on the line here. A pairis two, Kid. What do you say we call them up and I ask them to teach my homeboyfrom the Unit to suck honest-to-god pussy. I figure any girl come out of Lowell,she’s got to be an expert at that happy pastime. Way I heard it, they don’t donothing else but lay around and lick each other’s titties and suck those cunts.Now do you wanna tag along, or go to a motel and jack your dick?”The punk gave me a look of gratitude. “Hey. That’s OK! You really don’t mind?”“Hey. I done 16 years, Kid. I dig young boys, I just don’t advertise it.”“What about the AIDS?”“What about it?”“…if you tell those girls I’ve been…you know.”“I ain’t telling them double-barreled bags of shit nothin’. Are you?”The punk smiled from ear to ear. “Fuck ’em!” he said.“So what do you say?”“I say DO it!”So we hit the streets of Tampa running. It cost me a quarter to get one of the whores on the phone. She said they wereFrench teachers and could we meet them at the Blind Pig for our lessons? Shesaid to look for her in a red dress with a big black flower at the waist. She’dbring her friend.The next quarter went to call a cab. I didn’t want to waste a minute getting toour first class.The air in the Blind Pig was thick with the smoke of a thousand cigarettes. Thepeople inside were loose and uninhibited. We stood just inside the door andwatched everyone shouting and laughing. The lighting was subdued. Smoke swirledaround the room, turning the air into a layered blue haze. The punk was agog.“Outta sight!” he breathed.We inched our way into the lounge and walked up to the bar like free men. Nobodytried to stop us. We weren’t arrested or searched for contraband. Buying a drinkwithout being searched for loose canteen coupons was a novelty. So was theselection. The faggot bought the first round. Dickel on the rocks. First icecubes I’d seen in sixteen years. They were little tiny things, curved on oneside and flat on the other. Sparkling and tinkling as I swirled them in theglass.I checked out the Kid’s fat wad of cash. He’d sucked him a lot of black cock toget that stash. I hoisted my glass.“To survival, Kid.”He nodded. We clicked glasses and drank, glancing around the place and checkingout the action. It was a honky-tonk kind of joint. Country music going wide openon the juke box. Cheap wooden tables with low benches. The room wasthree-quarters full and the conversation was roaring along. The tables werepiled high with empty beer bottles and ashtrays overflowing with butts. The crapwas falling onto the floor and being trampled underfoot. It was a real dump. Itreminded me of the open dorms at the Unit. Sloppy as hell but as alive as ananthill. I decided I liked it. The punk loved the shit out of it. We’d beenthere 15 minutes already and nobody had cracked on him for some ass. For him,that was a whole new way of life.But there was one thing at the Blind Pig that the Unit never had: real whores.Not chain gang pussy boys, but genuine double-barreled, ass-swinging cunts.There were whores wandering around the joint smiling at everyone. Big widesmiles to pull in them big stiff dicks. Same smiles you see on the queens at theUnit. A lot of them in red dresses, but I was looking for that black flower.A bitch with a mop of tangled hair dyed three separate shades sauntered pastwith a bottle of Pabst Blue Ribbon in one hand and a pickled pigfoot in theother. She smelled real fucking sweet.“Check out that real live snatch,” I said to the queer.“What about her?”“She’s trolling for dick. Down here at the Blind Pig twitching her fanny at us.That’s your basic working girl. Needs to pay her rent same as us. Look at hermove. You like whores, Kid?”“I like ’em. I like how they move in those tight little skirts…Whooooeee! Ifshe’d bend over a little, I could see clear up to where the sun don’t shine.Maybe see the wet spot!”“What wet spot?”“There was this old con down on M-Wing. For some money or some canteen, didn’tmatter which, he’d tell about a gal he saw get ‘lectrocuted up in Alabama. Toldme all about it. He looked up her dress and there was a big roll of pussy upthere and the crack part was wet. He said it was the girlie’s wet spot and theyall got one. Reckon she’s got one up under there?” The punk seemed genuinelycurious.“That sounds like old Curly Bill’s yarn.”“That was the guy: Curly Bill. A nasty old fucker with long yellow teeth, andnot too many of them. I had to give him a whole jar of Maxwell House to hear hisstory.”“Was it worth it?”“Hell yeah! Best story I ever heard.”“You heard some others?”“Sure, plenty. I saw Ted Bundy, Murf-the-Surf, the Catch-Me Killer, and theGhoul.”“The Ghoul?”“Sure. You know, that cop that killed the 34 women down around Oakland Park. Cut’em up. Drank their blood. Fucked ’em when they were dead.”“Go on! You saw this guy?”“Walking around on two feet.”“Wha’d he look like?”“Big ole scary looking fucker. Looks like Hoss Cartwright.”“You say he killed 34 women?”“Men, women, kids. Nobody knows for sure. I read the whole true story in InsideDetective. It had pictures of two girls he ate, plus one he hung by the neck.That one was drawing flies.”“Showed a picture of that!?”“God’s truth.”“You talk to this Ghoul?”“Are you crazy? I seen that fucker coming and I got the hell out of the way. Iwasn’t gonna piss him off and become Number 35. Know what I mean?”I laughed. The Ghoul. I wondered who had come up with that one. Some mediaasshole no doubt. Last I heard it was the Sex Beast. Now it’s the Ghoul. Christon a stick.I finished my whiskey; went up by the barmaid and ordered two more. We knockedthem back. The night was young. The cigarette smoke and music swirled around us.The voices banged away at our ears. We took it all in, feeling right at homewith the ear-splitting din.I felt like talking. The booze was loosening me up, and the night was startingto glitter in my brain. I checked my watch, then felt foolish for wanting to seehow long we had before count.No count to stand at 8:00 p.m. Stand to attention, rattle off your number like arobot. No name, just your number. No nigger jive blasting from those black boomboxes. No prancing homos swishing off to the shithouse to suck black cock. TheUnit—a place of rehabilitation. If the taxpayers only knew the truth.I leaned closer to the pussy boy, put my elbow on the bar, and took a knock ofbourbon. Damn good stuff.“I done more than fifteen years, hard time. They bum-rapped me. I ain’t no altarboy but you know a bum rap, it don’t sit too well in a man. Festers in therelike a cancer. A convict does his time. You get caught and you take the fall andyou pull the time and you come out and you go back to work. You don’t cry, youdon’t snitch for a plea. You’ve heard it said, if you can’t do the time, don’tpull the crime.”The punk nodded sagely into his drink. “What you fall on, Oldcock?”“Murder! Bloody…fucking…murder.”“Jesus.”“Yeah. Chopped them up with a machete, they said. So when I get to Butler I gostraight into Solitary. You know the drill.”The punk nodded.“And for nothing, on the house, I get four years in the Box. Can you believesuch shit?”The punk’s eyes widened as he shook his head in sympathetic understanding. “Iknow a guy. He raped the Warden’s secretary. He got two years in the Box. Thisother guy, he got caught with a .38 caliber pistol inside the prison. He didmaybe five years in the Box. So if you get four years in the Box from jumpstreet, I figure the Warden plain don’t like you, or a buddy of the Warden don’tlike you. That’s it, couldn’t be nothing else.”“Good, you understand. So you can see how I might be tempted to get me a macheteand settle a few old scores.”“I can understand the temptation.”“I ain’t saying I’m gonna do it. But after that first four years in the Box, youcould say my attitude turned a tad radical.”“But you did manage to get out of the Box, right?”“Right. And here’s what happened. Along comes this new warden, Braselton. Bigfucking gorilla runs about 280. Lifts weights. Came down from Cook County. Youknow, Chicago. Me, I’m from the Windy City, grew up on the Northside. That wasback when Old Man Daley was Mayor and the cops were real mean. Capone, he cameout of Chicago. Word I got was that Capone had Cermak bumped off down on MiamiBeach…”“What? You lost me. Who’s Cermak?”“Mayor Anton Cermak. He got killed in Miami. They said it was an attempt to killthat Jew Roosevelt.”“Roosevelt? Hey, that was before I was born, Home. Tell me how you got out ofthe Box,” the punk groused.“Well I done a few short stretches at Statesville, one longer at Menard.Braselton knew me there. He comes down here to Florida and finds me in the Box.He takes a look at my jacket, sees I ain’t got a single write-up, so he decidesto give the homeboy a break. Gets me a transfer out of the Box right over toUnion County, Raiford Prison. I go straight to the Rock. F-Floor. Nasty grungyplace. Then I get assigned a job. Put me in the packing plant. Ever been in thepacking plant, Kid?”“Never was.” He took a knock at his drink.“Well it’s a place you wouldn’t forget. You know that bacon they serve in thechow hall with the hog bristles still in it?”“Yeah. Not that you’d see me eating it. I do admit the niggers scarf it rightup. They’ll snatch it right off your tray if you so much as blink an eye.”“OK. That’s the bacon I’m talking about. The packing plant is where that crap ismade and the noise alone is enough to drive you fucking insane. Machinerycrashing and slamming all day long. The squealing pigs.”“Is that four-legged or two-legged pigs?”“Very funny. This is serious. Now pay attention.”“OK, run it.”“So Benny drives down to Avon Park for a truckload of pigs. Great big fuckingsows maybe three hundred, four hundred pounds. He comes back and we run them outof the truck and into a pen.”“A pigpen.”“Right. Then someone gives ’em a jab on the ass with an electric prod and theygo running up a narrow chute. They’re lined up in there snout to asshole;squealing like mad, crapping all over each other, just like the poor slobs ontheir way to Sparky. Same exact thing. Joe fastens some iron shackles around therear hocks and this other fella gives the porker a pop on the noggin with asledgehammer.”“Jesus.”“Yeah. Wham! Then they press a button and the hoist jerks the pig up into theair. The fuckers ain’t even dead, just stunned, and they come to while they’rehanging upside down. You never heard such screaming. The hog comes swinging downfrom the slaughter chute toward the killing floor and the thing is spewing shitand piss out its ass like a volcano.”“Gross.”“You ain’t heard it all yet. Bobby Batson is there with this huge fucking knifeand he slits their throats. The blood comes splashing out all over the place.They spray blood from the front and crap from the rear, and there’s four hundredpounds of bucking meat writhing in the chains, gurgling and squealing andscreaming like hell.”“So what was your job?”“I gutted them. Slashed their fucking bellies open and got a snoot full ofstench for my trouble. Let me tell you, Kid, there ain’t no rehabilitation inthe packing plant. Raw meat. Yellow tallow. Greasy coils of spilling guts. Andthe stench. I came out of four years in the Hole and walk into that. They toldme it was supposed to be job training. Educational. Yeah, teach me the WorkEthic. The parole man would like it, they said. I’d have a skill to take with meto the streets. Make me a good parole risk. You’ve heard that story?”The punk nodded. Caught the bartender for two more Dickels with ice. Goodsipping whiskey. We sloshed them down. A whore rubbed her tits against thepussy-boy as she pressed through to the bar. He gave me a look. Big eyes, bigwet smile. Thinking about a little cooze, he was. It was around. All around.“Where are those French whores, Oldcock?”“Don’t cum in your drawers, Kid. They’ll be around. You think you’re the onlystiff they got lined up to bury tonight? We got “call girls” coming. They ain’tlike some snaggletooth rummy you find in a tonk. Call girls—you call ’em on thephone, make you an appointment. They get top dollar. But you’ve got a wad ofgreen to spend.”“Damn right. Top-notch pussy, that’s what we want!”“Yeah, that packing plant was a real trip. Every time I see a cop I think of it.Never could get the blood washed off me. It’d be under my fingernails, mytoe-nails, between my toes. Slice one of those sows and she squirts blood andcrap right in your face. It’s in your hair, dripping down your arms, soaked intoyour clothes. August, September—it was hotter than hell in there. Sixty millionflies buzzing around eating that liquid pigshit mixed with blood. We weredrowned in that slime, Kid. We died. Our souls flew out and went away.”“Sounds bad, Home.”“You don’t know the half of it, Kid. The old Rock was nothing but fuckingmadness. The noise and the stench alone was enough to drive any man insane. Theybuilt the place about 1920, so there’s sixty to seventy years of sweat and pisssoaked into the cement. August comes around and you can’t hardly breathe for thestink of the place. We’d put in a day in the packing plant and then the screwswould herd us back to the cellblocks. F-Floor, H-Floor, G-Floor, all that wasthe packing plant crew.”“Big gang down there, huh?”“Oh, hell yes. There was goddamned niggers in the cells too. Nasty fucking dirtyblack-assed niggers that never had a bath in their whole sorry lives. Filthyanimals.”“Mama Herk was OK.”“Some are OK, some ain’t. And that’s a fact.”“Where are our whores? You think they’ll be here soon?”“Forget the whores for a minute. I’m getting to the part about when they cut offNewcock Benson’s head.”“Cut the guy’s head off? What was it, an accident?”“Not exactly. Those niggers, you know they were bad, but at least they speakEnglish and they understand when you tell them to hit the showers. Then westarted getting them Cuban assholes, Marielito scum. Castro opens the door tohis insane asylums and lets all the nuts go to Florida. Guess where they endup?”“The Rock?”“Fucking-A. And these are crazy insane fuckers, not convicts. No habla ingles.No comprendo. Let me tell you what they comprendo, is a big fucking knife. Andeven normal guys were driven mad by the stench and the filth and theblood-sodden clothes stinking up the whole cellblock. Guys were bugging up everyday—regular white guys. You never knew when it would happen. It was a 24-hourred alert just to stay alive. Bad on the nerves, Kid, I can tell you that.”“What about cutting off the head?”“Shit. Some guy would pull out a knife—a hog slasher, pig sticker, even a meatcleaver. And he’d start swinging. Slaughter guys in the cell just like they werepigs coming off the chute, hanging from a chain. Get the picture?”“I’m seeing it. Living color.”“OK. One day we are in this 20-man cell and a shiteater name of Dennison comesalong with this newcock to put him in our cell. Swede Perkins, who was the bosscoon of the cell, tells Dennison we ain’t got no more room, the cell is full.Twenty bunks, twenty guys: White, Nigger, Cuban. Dennison tells Swede thenewcock is coming in as number 21, and we ain’t got jack-shit to say about it.So Swede tells Dennison if he puts the newcock in the cell, we’re cutting offhis damn head. Dennison just laughs and opens the door. He pushes the newcockinto the cellblock and walks away. An hour later he comes back for a securitycount and the head is laying out on the tier.”“No shit?”“No shit.”“So what happened?”“We didn’t get more guys than bunks, that’s what happened. Every other cell wasstacked up with guys like they’re sardines in a damn can. Cell H-4 had twentyguys, just what it was supposed to have.”“What’d the cops do?”“Nothing. Every guy in the cell said he killed the newcock. Twenty guys. Twentyconfessions. So the State said fuck it and put it under the rug. Called it asuicide or some such shit. Suicide my ass. Dennison was told. He murdered thatnewcock. That was the old chain gang, Sonny. Pussy-boys don’t have that kind ofsolidarity. No snitches stayed alive in them days. Ain’t like now.”“What about the screw, Dennison. Did he get fired?”“Dennison got fucking killed, Kid.”“Whaaaat?”“Time goes by. The cons seen the cop who was responsible for the murder is stillaround. One day they caught him in the hallway and gutted him like a porker.”“But…why?”“Because Swede told him, if you put the newcock in the cell he’s dead meat.Dennison put him in. The newcock had to die. Real convicts don’t run off at themouth, Kid. Dennison killed him. The State should have fried Dennison same asthey fried Aubrey Adams, that baby-raping pig from Marion C.I. Since nothing wasgonna be done officially, it got done unofficially. A lot more of themshiteating DOC motherfuckers are gonna die before it’s all over. You watch andsee.”“Home, it sounds even worse than the Unit.”“It was.” I took a drink and leaned closer to the Kid.“Check this out: I lasted one week. Then I walked down to Classification, askedthat old shithook Parks for a job change. Kitchen, laundry, farm squad,anything. Parks pulls out my jacket. He scans through it. Looks me dead in theeye and tells me his paperwork says I’m a butcher. I tell the fucker, T neverdone no butcher job on the street. Armed robbery, button work. That was mytrade. Never done an honest day’s work in my life, at least not in no straightJohn detail. What the fuck is this butcher trade crap?’“Parks, that miserable shit, he says: ‘Right here on your sheet, Boy, says TheButcher of Blind Creek. Got you some experience, says here. Hung ’em by theirankles and opened up their bellies. Figured you’d like it in the packing plantsince that’s your style. Heard it said them sows scream like real women. Hang’em, gut ’em, listen to ’em scream. Talk about hog heaven, says right here youget off on that shit. Now get the hell out of my office.’“The kid groaned. “Fucking Parks! I know him. What an asshole. Kept a bottleright in his desk. I went to a progress review with him once, and he was drunkon his ass. Parks. Sweet Jesus. Everybody hates that fucker.”“I seen it my own self, kid. I seen a lot. Parks and plenty more just like him.I don’t know where the State dredges up the human shit they have running theseprisons…. Someone must tack job opportunity notices up in gay bars. Half thestaff of the Unit is faggot. The citizens say they want rehabilitation. I’veseen their program. What it is, see, this rehabilitation program, it’s aflip-flop deal. You flip into the system one way and flop out another way. Youknow? Go in straight, come out queer. Go in healthy, come out diseased. Go innormal, come out perverted. Flip-flop rehabilitation theory. An educated mancould write a book about it.”The faggot nodded his agreement. How could he argue? His program might have beena little different, but he knew what I meant. The dickeater never had to ask asilly question about rehabilitation. He understood.I watched his pretty-boy long-lashed eyes surveying the action. A covert obliqueswing of the eyeballs, always on the alert for the sudden move, the danger ofthe knife in the back. He slid up to the bar, copped two more bourbons, and paidfor them. We slurped them down, the heat of the alcohol exciting our senses.“Where’s those fucking whores?” the kid moaned.“Home douching out their cunts getting ready for two hardheads out on earlyrelease. They squirt perfume on their tits, powder their assholes, usecherry-flavored juice up in their pussies to make them taste nice when you suckon ’em.”“Cherry flavored pussy?” The punk was in awe.“As I live and breathe.”“Real call girls.”“The McCoy. Call ’em and they come.”“Like a couple of bitches. Here, girl! Here, girl!” He was getting giddy.“You got the picture, now hold it.”“I’ve been holding it. Now I want to stick it in one of them pussy rolls.”“Don’t worry, you will. Tonight. Now listen to my philosophy.”“You make up a philosophy in the box?”“I did. Now listen.”“Tell me.”“Blood,” I said, “that’s where it all starts. I was up to the Unit during theriot back in ’79. There was plenty of blood to see there. The shiteaters came inon us with clubs and mace and spilled our blood. They broke our bones, bruisedour meat. All you are to them, kid, is an animated bag of meat and blood. I seenit go down. I had a vision. Teeth were all over the quarterdeck. Smashed teeth.Step on them, they crunch like gravel. They’d run you down to Q-Wing and work onyou with those clubs and cattle prods. Obedience training. Attitude adjustment.Rehabilitation. The beginning and the end of it is blood. The blood fills yourmama’s insides. She squats and squeezes you out her cunt like a lump of crap.You come sliding down her chute right between her piss and her shit. There’s acosmic message there, if you study on it. We eat shit and die. Just like it sayson the back of the Scooter Tramps jackets.”“That’s your philosophy?”“That’s it…blood. That’s where it starts and that’s where it ends.”“Makes sense.”“You gotta let it all out, kid. You can’t keep it locked up in the box in yourbrain any more. To the public you ain’t no more than a carcass on a hook. Theydon’t know nothin’. They don’t want to know nothin’. They think we live at somekind of summer camp. Tell Joe Six-pack what goes on inside a prison and he’lljust call you a liar. But now we’re out. First we’re gonna have us some fun andthen I don’t know about you, but I’ve got some people to look up. A few folkswho owe me.”I lifted my glass and realized it was empty. I started to order another roundwhen I saw a hooker in a red dress come swinging through the door with a jauntyblack silk flower pinned to her waist. She had her blonde hair up in a Frenchtwist. The other French teacher was right behind her, a brunette withfluffed-out hair in a shiny royal blue number. I gave them the high sign andnudged the punk, “Here comes our French lesson.”The two bimbos bounced over to a table and sat down. I took the cocksucker bythe arm and steered him through the crowd. We walked up to the women and satdown, just like free men.The women were both obviously professionals, with painted crimson lips slick andwet. Their cheeks were rouged, their noses powdered. They were ready. I gavethem a sharp, knowing grin. The women smiled back with avaricious eyes. Theystudied me and the punk, looking us up and down. I stared directly at theirtits. They both had nice big ones. The punk snickered and sucked up some booze.His eyes were as red as a vampire’s. His baby face was pink and greasy, He gaveme with a callow grin. A full boner curved up toward his navel. He was a randyboy.“I’m Jerry, and this my road dog, Danny.” The whores looked at him and smiled toeach other. They knew easy money when they saw it, and they were both lickingtheir lips.Danny gave up a self-conscious giggle. “You ladies the schoolteachers we calledabout private tutoring in French?”“Oui-oui. I’m Candy,” said the blonde.“And I’m Tiffany,” chimed in the brunette.“You guys afford lessons?” asked Candy.The kid flashed his roll and asked, “Can I buy you ladies a drink?”“French champagne,” Candy gushed. “The French lessons are two hundred an hour.Each.”The punk blanched.Tiffany arched an eyebrow. “Can you handle it, Big Daddy?”“Sure—no problem.” The kid put on a lopsided grin and shoved off toward the barfor a round of drinks.“A couple of twenty-dollar hookers fleecing a lamb. Shame on you!” I grinned.“Lambs were born to be shorn,” Tiffany snapped.Candy nudged me. “How’d you get our number?”“Willy the Weasel.”“What’d Willy fall on last time—he tell you?”“Murder Two. Willy has him a wart right here.” I touched my finger to the sideof my nose.“So you know Willy.”“Sure. You think I’m vice squad?”“Just being careful.”“Yeah? Willy told me you two pulled time at Lowell.”Candy groaned. “I did ten months on a bar-tack machine in the garment factory.Job training for the street, you know?”“I know.”“Tiffany pulled a deuce at Broward. Armed robbery. She ain’t as genteel as shelooks. Where’d you pull yours?”“Raiford—the Rock.”“Did you see Andrea when they took her up there?” Tiffany asked.“Didn’t see her but I damn sure heard her. Bitch screamed her lungs out. Tookfour matrons to get her down the mainline. It was a real show. I got the storyfrom the Deathwatch Commander, Mr. Crowe.”The two hookers exchanged a glance and laughed.“What’s the joke?”The kid came back just then with a fifth of Dickel and a big green bottle ofchampagne. He popped the cork. While he was pouring a round, I asked the kid ifhe was around the Unit when the Jackson bitch came up for a ride on thelightning. He said he was.“Did she scream?” Tiffany asked.“Screamed like she was being murdered. Everyone in the Unit heard her. TheCaptain told me there would have been a shit trail from the back ramp to thedeath cell, except they had her in sanitary briefs.”The two whores laughed some more.“What’s the joke?” Danny asked.“My exact same question,” I added.“Tiffany saw when they put her on the transport van to ride her up to theChair,” Candy said.“She was shrieking like a maniac,” Tiffany giggled. “Old Lady Venziano, she’sthe warden down there, goes trooping down to Andrea’s cell and reads her thedeath warrant and transport order. The goon squad is there with chains andlocks. The nurse is standing by with the old-fashioned Kotex on a belt, and agreen diaper.”“What’s that about?” Danny asked.Tiffany arched an eyebrow his way. “The electric chair is at Starke. The Women’sDeath Row is west of Lauderdale, out in a swamp next to the County Dump. It’s a6 to 8 hour ride to Starke. Maybe you think they’ll stop and let her pee at agas station?”The kid shrugged, blushed a bit. “What they do is strap a piss sop to your cunt,honey, so you can piddle in it if you take a notion to go. The diaper is just incase you get real scared and start to shit. A girl on the way to the Chair mightget the urge, don’t you think?”The kid obviously didn’t know what to say.“Any more dumb questions?” Tiffany huffed.“Lighten up, babe,” Candy quipped, then turned to the Kid and said, “She’s onlybeen on the street three weeks. Takes awhile to shrug off the stresses andtensions of that lousy joint. Women screaming and hollering, sex-crazy for aman, everybody angling for the cutest dykes and trying for early release. It’sinsane.”Tiffany’s ire subsided. She said, “Andrea came back to Broward on a federalstay. She told us she took the mainline by storm. Went down with a tail-swingingstrut and at least five hundred men calling out for her to fuck them.”“Her fantasy,” I said.Tiffany continued, “Then they gave her a cell next to that Adams guy and theytalked.”“That part could be true,” the punk said.I nodded.“Then they took Adams and burned him up in the Chair, and that was the end ofhim.”Candy said, “Then when she came back to Broward she was full of shit about howshe had charmed the whole Unit. True or false?”“A little of both,” I allowed. “The guards had the Unit on lockdown when shemade her walk on the mainline. Crowe said she was crying and screaming. We heardthat in the cellblocks.“Lying damn bitch,” hissed Tiffany.We all drank up. The girls were originally from Atlanta and both were kicked outon early release. They were working the senior citizen trade at the condos.Lonely old men paid a mighty sweet dollar for juicy young snatch. Business wasbooming. I told them about the Rock. The rehabilitation. The packing plant. Theearly release.The pussy was telling them about Ted Bundy, the Catch-Me Killer and the Ghoul.The drone of conversation hummed around us and the caustic smoke stung our eyes.We discussed the mindless violence, the bloody murder, the sexual slavery of menand women in prison. How their bodies were bought and sold to the highestbidders, unleashing the perverted lusts that gave hopeless men and women areason to live from day to day.The blonde put her hand on my crotch. Sighed with anticipation as she rubbed herhand along my ready shaft. Tiffany snuggled with the punk, her professionalhands busy under the table. The sluts were already beginning to stink of rut.They gurgled and moaned, their minds clouded by the sexual business they neededto conclude. I looked at them with both contempt and lust. I slapped my emptytumbler onto the table and announced to the steamy group, “So let’s get laid!”Everyone understood that. We got right up and off we went.The fuck-boy was giddy. He couldn’t believe his luck. We left the Blind Pig withthe early release whores on our arms and lurched out into the humid warmth ofthe summer night. Nebraska Avenue was blazing with light. Cars with glaringheadlights cruised up and down the Strip, their makes, models and styles allforeign and unrecognizable to me. Neon signs flashed and blinked, advertisingplaces and products I’d never heard of. Music throbbed and boomed from thedoorways of bars and clubs. The whole city of Tampa was a gaudy whorehousecatering to the pleasures of tourist flesh.A stinking coal-black nigger in a dirty T-shirt rattled a paper bag in theshadows of a doorway. “White lady, white lady,” he sang out, “Crack.”“Get fucked, nigger!” I snarled.Candy giggled. The dope dealer retreated into his lair.We turned off Nebraska. The side street was in darkness. The whores had them anold two-story flophouse trick pad. Danny was anxious to get it on. He was almostdragging Tiffany up the stairs. The stairwell stank of dry rot and stale piss.Familiar smells—prison smells. The stairs led up a landing. There were rooms onthe right and left. Whores and transients.Candy fished a key out of her clutch purse. She unlocked a door and flipped on alight. Hundreds of cockroaches fled, scuttling for the cracks. There were a pairof unmade ratty beds along the far wall, an aluminum chair, a Formica tablestrewn with Big Mac wrappers, cigarette butts and black ants.“Home sweet home,” Tiffany announced blithely.“Fucking pig pen,” I said.“You don’t like it, hit the road, Jack,” Candy spat.Danny toppled onto a bed. There was a half bottle of Dickel in his hand. Heunscrewed the cap. Tiffany grabbed the bottle, drank up, handed it to me andbegan pulling off Danny’s clothes. His trousers were hung up on his boner. Weall laughed. I took a hit on the bottle, and passed it on to Candy. She drainedit, tossed it in a corner and unzipped her dress. The cheap red fabric fell in apuddle at her feet. She caught it with her foot and kicked it into the samecorner with the Dickel bottle. The bedraggled black silk flower was twisted andbroken off its stem. It lay on the floor by the naked feet of the blonde whore.I watched her strip, burning with a puritanical rage as she shook her creamyudders free of her lacy black brassiere.The punk and his dark-haired whore were wrestling on the bed. The blonde pulledoff her black silk panty, put it to her nose and sniffed it, made a wry face andtossed it. She cleared her throat. “Straight French, half-and-half oraround-the-world?”“French for me,” I said.“Pay up!” the blonde said, holding out her mitt.“You don’t trust me?”“Fuck no!”I laughed. Fished out Danny’s roll from his pants and paid the freight. Thewhore nodded. Put the four hundred in her shoulder bag.Danny gasped and giggled on the bed. The dark-haired slut on top of him wasnaked. She had tapered fingers with the color of fresh blood glistening on thelong enameled nails. Her hands fluttered around the boy’s dick with professionalskill. They knew what to do and were busily going about it.The nude blonde stood there like a cow in a slaughter chute. Her eyes werebovine and dumb. She scratched absently at her pubic hair as we watched Tiffanywork her magic on the fuck-boy’s dick. What a pro. The queer was gasping. Theslut was straddling his cock, her white legs spread wide. A lavish mop of darkpubic hair hung down between her legs. She took the punk’s boner in her righthand and carefully angled it into her hole. She lowered herself with a grunt ofpleasure. Danny’s hands clenched the pillowy white buttocks, his fingerskneading the soft flesh. The impaled woman levered herself up and down on hispole growling deep in her throat. Her eyes were closed. A ropy tendril of salivahung from her chin. We listened to the building tempo of passion, the wet smackof sweaty flesh meeting. The brunette kept sliding up and down Danny’s cockuntil he arched his back and emptied his load, leaving her infected with theAIDS plague.I unzipped my jeans, took out my own stiff boner, turned to the naked blonde andcommanded her, “On your knees, bitch!”The whore did as she was told. She took my root in her mouth and sucked on it.She’d done it before and was just fine. I let her work. I stood there and lookeddown at the dandruff on her head. It looked like she might have lice as well.I listened to the slurping, sucking sounds she made as they mingled with thewhimpers coming from Danny. I felt the head of my dick rub the back of herthroat. I relished the slippery warmth of her spit, heard the gurgle and mewl ofher efforts. I caressed Candy’s blonde, dandruffed hair. It had a greasy feel.She hummed as she sucked. It was a nice touch. I tried to pick up the tune, butcouldn’t recognize it. Must be a new one.Outside there was the distant whoop of a police siren. Trouble for somebody, butnot for me. The thought of being free was exciting. I speeded up my thrusts.Finally I held the blonde whore’s head steady, shuddered and came in her mouth.She struggled to break free. I wrapped her hair around my hand and held her headtight on my cock. Danny was amused. He caught my eye as he giggled; probablyremembering his own head locked on a man’s spurting dick.Tiffany wiped her cunt with a big wad of Kleenex and dropped it on the floor.“Ride ’em, cowgirl!” she yelped at Candy.I felt the blonde’s teeth close around my dick, and I shoved her away from me.It was the only thing to do. She fell back on the floor landing on her backside,gagging and heaving. She spat a gobbet of semen on the grimy floor.“You motherfucker!” she shrieked.I kicked her hard in the stomach and she doubled up. “Teach you to bite my dick,bitch!” Bloody vomit spewed up from her gut and splashed from her mouth onto theblack flower on the floor. She retched and gasped. Her eyes were swimming withfear and disgust. Two tendrils of slick puke ran from her nose. “Like to bite mydick? I’ll teach you to bite!”I kicked her in the face. Teeth flew from her mouth. The force slammed her backinto the wall. She bounced off and collapsed onto her side. Her head thumped thefloor.Tiffany screamed. Danny sucked in his breath and jerked upright, suddenly alert,his prison instincts overriding the alcoholic haze. The naked brunette made alunge for her skirt. As she made her reach I drop-kicked her in the jaw. Shespun around and crashed into the bedpost and flopped down to the floor intoCandy’s champagne-laced vomit.I leaped in the air and came down full force on Tiffany’s chest with my knees.Her rib cage collapsed under my weight.She coughed, her chin slick with glistening blood. Gurgling rasps were her onlysound. Her body stiffened slightly, and a thin bubbling sound came up from deepin her throat. The breath snagged and then stopped. Her legs began to jerk inspasms and a pool of yellow urine widened around her hips. The breath came backwith a start. A few rapid gasps rattled in the back of her throat. Pink frothylung blood gushed from her mouth, and she was dead.“Jerry! Jerry!” Danny yelled.“Fucking sluts,” I growled.The punk’s face was fishbelly white. The gray eyes widened with sudden terror. Ismiled. Pulled my knife from my boot. Strode toward him. Danny cringed backagainst the wall, his delicate fag hands waving before him. Cowardly littleAIDS-ridden queer.“Jerry! No! Please!” he blubbered.I swung the blade in with a sharp upward motion. It glanced off a rib and slicedup into the faggot’s yellow heart. I pulled the shank out and chopped it acrosshis face. A fountain of blood erupted. He started sliding down the wall. I heldhim up with my left hand and drove the shank into him again. And again. Andagain. His body slumped sideways, toppled over and hit the deck. I sank a kickinto his balls. “Cocksucker!” I hissed.He never heard me. He was dead.The blonde whore had rolled onto her back.Her face was bloody and broken, her eyes rolled in their sockets with the pain.Vomit and blood streamed from the corners of her mouth. Bloody bubbles formedand burst at her nostrils as she attempted to breathe.I felt the pounding of my heart as the excitement fanned my rage. The copperysmell of whoreblood had me sweating and my nerves on fire.The blonde bitch groaned.The brunette was splayed across the floor in a ghastly pool of blood and urineand vomit. I walked over to her to get a closer look. Her open eyes weredilated. The blood oozing from her nose and ears was beginning to thicken. Shelooked dead.I leaned over and punched the blade into her heart, just to be sure.I picked up Danny’s discarded trousers and removed the still-fat wad of cashfrom his front pocket.I searched the pocketbooks of the two hookers and came up with a couple ofC-notes, in addition to my own four hundred. Chump change.I heard the blonde whore groan. She was still on her back, lips swollen, eyespuffy and blackened. I walked over to her. I could see the cheesy crack betweenher legs, with the cooties crawling in her bush. She wasn’t a natural blonde. Iexamined her ruined face and noticed that somehow her narrow, aristocratic nosehad remained unbroken.I lifted the heel of my heavy boot and brought it down smartly on her snotlocker, driving it up into her brain.The whore didn’t move and made no further sound. I set the point of the bladeinto the hollow of her white throat and shoved it in until I felt it grate bone.Then I twisted it. I picked up the sodden black flower and placed it in her evilmouth. It looked just right.I opened the door to the flophouse flat. The hallway was dusty and empty. Iwalked down the rotting stairs to the street, with Danny’s roll to keep mecompany.I thought of Canada, the Bahamas, the coast of North Africa. Then I thought ofthe cop who had framed me for murder sixteen years ago. Within an hour I was ona bus to Miami.image [Images/157.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Former State’s Attorney Robert Stone convicted Gerard John Schaefer of themurders of Georgia Jess up and Susan Place, and connected him to several dozencases, calling him “the greatest killer of women of this century.” “Schaefer ought to be in the worst possible prison in Florida,” Stone said. “Iwant to be sure I am consulted before he is released.”“Schaefer is dangerous. I do not think he can control himself. He is a madman,and if he claims I’m trying to keep him in prison, he is right. If he got out,it would be like signing death warrants for a lot of people.” Note: Gerard John Schaefer specifically insisted that Robert Stone’s statementappear as a sidebar to “Early Release.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------NIGGER JACKThe warden of the Florida State Prison at Starke strapped John Spenkelink intothe electric chair and fried his ass on May 25, 1979 and right away convictsbegan scheming for the job of death chamber orderly; that was because of ahooker named Sonia. Sonia was the whore who’d murdered two cops down in Broward County: TrooperBlack of the Highway Patrol and Constable Irwin from Canada. She’d shot themdead at a rest area off 1-95 hard by Pompano Beach. A stinking scum-sucking ratby the name of Walter Rhodes had turned state’s evidence and put Sonia’s prettyyoung tail in line to fry on Old Sparky. She’d burn with her convict boyfriend,Jesse Tafero. It would be an event to see.It all added up that Sonia would be riding the lightning. Spenkelink hadmurdered an ex-con rapo-faggot and the State had burned him, so there was nodoubt that Sonia would be coming along to pay us a visit by and by. Everybody inthe joint believed it would happen and almost everybody wanted to be on hand towatch—not because Sonia was disliked, but because she was prime pussy. She’dbeen a high-priced hooker on the streets, she’d blown away a pair of law dogs,she had great teats, and was the reigning Queen of Death Row.The State would burn Sonia and some lucky convict would be assigned the job T ofmopping up her pee and emptying her knickers after the execution. The prisonguards always have someone handy to dump the executed person’s drawers beforeturning the smoking corpse over to the free-world undertaker, so we all knewsomeone would luck into the job of dumping Sonia’s. It was a job to covet, andthere was more to it than the chance to see real pussy. The job carried aguarantee of an endless income of coffee and cigarettes tendered by anyonewanting to hear the true story of Queen Sonia on her electric throne. Look at itas a form of chain gang Social Security.We knew this to be a fact because of Curly Bill. Curly had personally watched acunt sizzle in the Alabama electric chair in 1957. This unusual event occurredwhile Curly was pulling a stretch at the Holman Penitentiary, and for a smallgratuity he’d sit down and tell anyone the whole story. I’d heard he told itwell, so being of a curious nature I went down to the prison canteen, picked upa jar of Maxwell House Coffee and a bag of Oreos, and moseyed on down to CurlyBill’s cell. I found him sitting on his bunk rolling a smoke.I poked my mug in his door and said, “Curly Bill, if you’re in a yarning moodI’d like to hear the story of the fried cunt.” I took the jar of coffee out ofthe paper sack and tossed it on his bed. “Talking can dry a man out. I broughtyou a little something to wet your whistle while you talk.” A flagrant bribe.Curly Bill eyed the coffee. His tongue ran out and dampened the rolling paperfor his cigarette. “Whole damn jar, all for me?” he inquired.I shrugged. “Sure, why not? I heard you tell quite a story.”He lit his cig and took a drag. “What sort of story are you wanting to hear?”“What kinds you got, Curly?”He pursed his lips in thought. “Well, there’s the kind I tell the Man when hecomes snooping around. And there’s the kind I tell the social science girliesfrom the university day trip every month. And then there’s the true fact of whatreally happened the night the Captain strapped a Tutweiler cunt to Old Sparkyand she rode the lightning down to the flaming pit of Hell.” He cocked aneyebrow at me and said, “That pussy was so hot steam rose from between her legs.Now…what sort of yarn did you fancy, Jerry?”“The one with the smoking hole.”Curly Bill grinned. “That’s the one the free people don’t want to hear.”“I ain’t been free for awhile, Old Man.”He nodded the truth of that statement. He’d been seeing me on the yard for overten years. He told me to come on into his cell and set my tail on a Number Tencan. I hunkered down while Curly cracked the seal on the jar of fresh mud andput a stinger in his cup to heat water. Steaming coal-black coffee, roll-yourown smokes, and all the time in the world. No place to go, nothing to do.Pulling a life hitch. May as well listen to an oldcock tell a tale of the waythings were in the Alabama chain gang, not so long ago, not so far away.Curly Bill was one of the slimiest human slugs ever to crawl out from between awhore’s legs, but he was a good storyteller. He perched himself on the edge ofhis rack, took a sip of the smoking Joe and began his story.“Her name was Rhonda Belle Martin and they’d drove her up from the JuliaTutweiler Penitentiary for Women earlier that day. She rode the prison deathtrain north, a chained bitch in an unmarked van with a one-way ticket to thestate Electric Chair. She was condemned meat, the kind the prison screws burn atHolman Penitentiary. They kept her in a cell right by the electric chair for afew hours, then Warden Hobbs got him a call from the Governor’s Office at theState Capitol. The message was plain and simple: ‘Fry the Bitch.’”“Were they burning women regular back then, Curly?”“More than these days, but not a passel. Now, a bitch figures she can get awaywith murder, but back then it wasn’t such a sure thing.”“So they brought her up from Tutweiler, and then what?”“It was a little bit secret actually. The first sign we men on the cellblockshad that she’d burn was when a death house screw come up into our living area tofetch Billy Mumford out’n his cell. Billy had the job to shave the condemned.Head and leg.”“What kind of job is that?” I wondered.“That’s special barber assignment. Before they take you and set you in the chairyou got to have a body shave so the electricity runs all around you nice andsmooth. Billy does the leg where the electrode fits on, and he does the head.They let a man shave around his own peter.”I gave Curly Bill a snort of disbelief. “I have my doubts anyone has to shavethe hair around his peter for a ride on Sparky. What’s the sense in it?”“It’s a rule. And if you don’t care to believe my true tale you can march yourdumb ass down to L-Wing and ask that nigger Jim Richardson about the body shavehe got when they was making a practice run on him back in 1970. Body shave meansthey take every single hair off, even the ones on your nuts, boy.”“And a woman?”“They skin her beaver.”“Hard to believe.”“I ain’t asking you to believe. I’m telling you how it was and what I saw up toHolman when Rhonda Belle sat on Sparky.” Curly Bill slurped some coffee andcontinued.“So Billy went off to the Death House with the screw and later Billy comes backand tells us we won’t believe it but there’s a cunt from Tutweiler down in theDeath Cell and they are fixing to fry her bottom real soon. He damn sure had ourundivided attention when we heard it was a real female. Then we wanted to hearabout the body shave. You know, did he shave her or what?”“Well? Did he?”“Billy told us he did shave her. He gave us the entire story. And it was hisclaim that when he was shaving her leg, her skirt was raised and he could seeall the way up to where some brown pussy hair was sticking out from underneaththe elastic around the leg hole. We were all asking him, ‘Did she just set thereand let you look?’s and Billy swore that she didn’t seem to mind his admirationof her charms at all. Now ain’t that a treat?”I bobbed my head acknowledging that it was indeed extraordinary and Curly Billcontinued, “Billy told us she wore a white panty. Nothing fancy, just the plainkind the State issues to the gals at Tutweiler, but he could see a pelt of darkbrown hair under the crotch part. And he truly believed that he could make outher crack right there in the center part, because there was like a little furrowwhere the panty indented and running along this groove was a wet spot dead inthe center, right where her hole would be underneath the cloth.”“I’d have been looking my own self. Bet on it!”Curly Bill hooted and slapped his knee. “And remember now in those days a galdidn’t show her leg all the way up to her asshole like they do now. It was areal unusual sight for Billy to behold, especially her being alive and settingin a chair right smack dab in front of his face. We all wanted to hear more andBilly told us everything two and three times, and each telling got better as herecollected little details and related them to us.“What sort of details do you mean?”“Her name for one: it was Rhonda Belle Martin. Ain’t that a lovely name—RhondaBelle? Her eyes: she had these big brown sad eyes with long eyelashes. Hervoice: it was a lady’s voice. Southern and polite, and sexy when she answered aquestion. He told us about her bosom: a real nice big one, and when she breathedit moved. Billy was taken with her hair…long, clean, pretty brown hair halfwaydown her back, almost to her waist. And then to prove it to us, Billy reachedinto his jacket and pulled out a swatch of thick brown hair held together by arubber band around one end. It reminded me of one of those Red Indian movieswhere they scalp a pioneer lady then run off with her hair and hook it onto apole.”“They let this guy Billy walk off with her hair?”“He’s the special barber, ain’t he? He cuts the air and hauls it off to thetrash bin. Only this time he took him a little souvenir to show us in thecellblocks.” Curly smiled a little, remembering her hair.“We all smelled that long hank of hair. Put it right up to our noses andinhaled; it smelt real nice. Billy couldn’t get enough of it. For a long time hewould lay on his bunk, spread that spill of curly locks over his face, and jackhis dick. For Billy, it was love at first sight between him and the cunt. Hetold us how he walked into her cell and right away saw she was no sweat hog. Shewas a sweet, pretty little woman. He had to tell her what to do. Take off yourshoes. Peel down the nylon stocking. Put your foot in the bucket. She wasshaking like a virgin and he had to calm her. Be gentle with her.There he is, soaping her leg and it’s trembling in his hands. Billy knows whereshe’s going, so he tries to go slow to give her a few extra minutes. She’s aboutto die, but he’s making love to her with his eyes. Maybe she loved him back. Hesaid she did. She cried when he cut her hair.”“Sounds like Billy was gone.”“Billy was speculating about that wet spot in the center of her crotch. Heclaimed it was love dew seeping, due to the way he was rubbing his hands up anddown her leg. I reckoned it was plain old pee. I told Billy not even thehorniest nympho at Tutweiler would be oozing love dew while sitting in theHolman Penitentiary Death House, even if Frank Sinatra was rubbing her leg.”“He took it pretty serious.”“Billy went all moony. We respected that. Didn’t mention a word about the meatwagon from Bates Funeral Parlor that rolled in the back gate while he was downin the Death Cell sparking Rhonda Belle. Freddy, down by the gate, he saw itroll in and put it on the grapevine. I reckoned that gal from Tutweiler wasthinking about something other’n Billy Mumford’s passionate love while she wasshaving the hair offen her own snatch. But I didn’t tell Billy that.”“What did you tell Special Barber Billy?”“We told him she’d get a stay from the courts. They’d send her back to Tutweilerand she’d write him fuck letters about what she’d do to him when he got out.What else?”“Wishful thinking.”“Sure. And we were joshing Billy about it when Captain Scotty Crowe came walkingup to the cellblock door. Captain Crowe ran the Death House. Enjoyed his worktoo. Got his name in the papers the time they burned that preacher’s daughterfrom Anniston. Cute little blonde with big tits, killed her mama and her daddy.Told everyone the Devil made her do it. Maybe so. Then she come up to Holman andstarts up that the Captain made an indecent proposal to her, so Warden Hobbs lethim strap her cunt to the Chair. He did such a fine job they let him superviseevery time a bitch burned. For all I know he’s still up there frying thosegirlies.”“Do you think he made an indecent proposal to that preacher’s daughter?”“Bet your hairy ass he did. Told me so hisself. Said that little blonde was sofine it would give a man a hard-on just to look at her. One night he goes downby her cell and suggests he could fix it so’s she’d die with a smile on herlips. She wanted to know how. He told her. She went off like a firecracker.Preacher’s daughter. What the hell?”Curly Bill took a long drag on his butt. Exhaled. Sighed. “So Captain Crowecalls me over to the door and told me a white woman would be executed within thehour and would I go down to the death chamber and keep my eye on Nigger Jack.”“Who was this Nigger Jack character?”“An asshole, a real asshole.”“I gathered as much, but why the need to eyeball the man?”“OK, Nigger Jack was the colored boy they had to clean up the mess after eachexecution. ‘Lectrocutions are a dirty sort of business; when it’s done NiggerJack unbuckles the corpse from the Chair and takes it back to a little roomwhere it gets hosed off. He’d strip the cadaver down, turn the hose on ’em, andstuff ’em in a rubber bag for delivery to the folks from Bates Funeral Parlor.It was nigger work and they had ’em a real Nigger to do it. Sorry excuse for ahuman being. Yeah, Nigger Jack was about as sorry as they come.”This story was getting good. I broke out the Oreos, took a handful and tossedthe bag to Curly Bill. “Well tell me, Curly, just how sorry was this nigger?”Curly Bill dunked an Oreo in his coffee and crammed the whole wet cookie in hismouth. “When he first came on the yard he told us how he ran dope and whores.Had him a string often white ladies, he said.” Curly Bill sighed.“Every nigger’s fantasy,” I smiled.“Right. We should have seen through that right away, but we didn’t. Whathappened was that Sandy, the guy who cleans up in the Classification Office overby the Administration Building, found his commitment order from the CircuitCourt. It was under a desk. Dropped by accident, I guess. Fact was that thisNigger Jack had worked in an undertaking establishment catering to the coloredtrade in Mobile. One day the owner of the joint comes walking in unexpected andthere was Jack with his radiator hose up the behind of a six-year-old niggerbaby that died in a car wreck. Jack wasn’t just raping a baby, he was raping adead baby.”“Pure fucking slime.”“You got the idea. So Sandy ran off some Xerox copies of this unusual rap sheetand passed them around the cellblocks and Carl Jones from Mobile happened toknow the dead kid’s family. So Carl walked on down to the machine shop and madehimself a big fucking shank and set off to hunt down Nigger Jack. Carl wastelling everyone how he planned to get ahold of Jack, cut off his Johnson andfeed it to him like a chow-hall donkey dick. Jack went screaming off to CaptainCrowe’s office begging the Captain to save him from Carl Jones and his sword ofretribution.“Now the Captain is a merciful man, and he has a sense of humor. So the Captaingives Jack a little private room right down next to the Death House. Gives him ajob mopping up the shit and the piss, let him clean the crap off the Chair aftereach execution. Best of all, Crowe figures the Nigger can pump him some hot assfresh out the Chair; after that, word on the yard was Nigger Jack takes a fancyto hot ass. Smoking hot.”Curly and I both laughed at that. He finished off his cup and plugged in thestinger for another round. He stacked three cookies neatly next to his cup andcontinued the story.“So Captain Crowe had strong feelings about leaving Nigger Jack alone with anaked white woman, even if she was dead meat. He was sure the Nigger would climbon her in a heartbeat. Figured a well-known cornhole artist like Jack wouldn’thesitate at real white pussy like Rhonda Belle. Fresh dead and still warm.Captain figured I wouldn’t let a nasty thing like that go on, knowing how I feelabout niggers. So I told him sure, I’d help him out. Stand around and watch theshow. I had nothing better to do, and that’s a fact. So the Captain opened thecell door and he took me with him on down to the death chamber. I’ll tell youthe truth. I wanted to have a look at this Rhonda girl that had Billy Mumfordrunning around with cow eyes and a stiff dick.”“Did you see her?”“Of course I saw her. Another cup?”I passed him my empty cup. He tossed me the Oreos and I hooked out a fistful.Munched one down and said, “I’ve been thinking about trying for that Orderly jobfor when they fry Sonia. What do you think?”“Good looking bitch. Nice tail.”“Better than Rhonda Belle?”“I’d say so. They say Sonia sold her ass on the street. Jesse says it’s true.She’d play Hide the Banana with Old Scotty, I’d bet that. Maybe scratch his eyesout for him too.” Curly smiled at the thought of it. “Rhonda Belle weren’t muchactually.”“What did you think when you first saw her?”Curly poured us our fresh cups and told me how it went down. “Me and the Niggerwas standing off to one side when they brought her in for the Chair. I wasfiguring I might see me a cat fight. The sight of the Chair can fire a gal up,get her to scratching and biting and howling. I’d heard some women go out thatway. Screaming. But luck wasn’t riding with me on that pass. She was noscreamer. It makes for a better story if I tell it with Rhonda Belle screamingand begging but you said you wanted the true story.” He blew on his coffee.“What actually happened was that Warden Hobbs marched off into that room wherethe condemned wait for the call to the Chair and told her pure and simple it washer time. He gave her the usual choice; she could come strolling in like a ladyor he could have her drug in by a couple of big screws on the execution detail.It didn’t matter a lick to him one way or the other. Miss Rhonda chose to gopeaceful.”“So much for the cat fight.”“Maybe. Maybe not. With a woman you never know. Captain Crowe used to say it wasbecause a gal is a high-strung, emotional type of creature. Women can gethysterical fast. He told me he’d seen it happen.”“So she said she’d go peaceful. Then what’d she do?”“Nothing much. The door from the holding cell opened and there she was. Two bigbulldagger matrons from the Tutweiler Women’s Penitentiary were with her. Bigmean looking bitches in black uniforms. Rhonda Belle weren’t no young gal,thirty years old if she was a day. Her big brown eyes were roaming around theroom, flickering here and there taking everything in. She seemed a little shakybut not too much. I’d seen men worse.”“What was she wearing?”Curly Bill thought on that one for a few beats. “She had a flowered scarf overher head. Covered up her being bald. She was dressed nice. Ladylike. A blackdress. Sunday-go-to-meetin’ clothes. Maybe like she’d wear to a funeral, come tothink of it. Nylon stockings. Black patent leather high-heeled pumps that made aclickety-clack sound on the cement when she walked. There was make-up on herface: shiny red lipstick, rouged cheeks, powdered nose. She was wearing niceperfume. Back then a woman wore what she pleased to her own execution. RhondaBelle fancied heels and hose, plenty of Chanel perfume. You could see how Billyhad fallen for her. She was pretty. She smelt real sweet.” Curly Bill licked hislips at the memory.“The two matrons had her by the elbows and steered her straight to the Chair.Warden Hobbs asked her to take a seat, so she turned herself around and satdown. She did it quick and smooth. She made a little squeak of alarm, like maybeshe figured she’d get a shock from the Chair. But when nothing happened shescooched herself around and settled her nerves. She looked at Warden Hobbs andgrinned sheepishly. He asked her if she was comfortable, and she bobbed herhead.“Then Warden Hobbs turned to Captain Crowe and ordered him to strap her in forthe ride. She was looking a bit dazed, like maybe she really had been thinkingshe’d be going back on down to Tutweiler where she’d sit in her cell and writesteamy letters to Billy Mumford at Holman and all of a sudden it dawned on herthat a stay wasn’t coming after all. She was in for a big shock, compliments ofthe State of Alabama. I asked the Nigger, ‘Who’d she kill?’“‘Captain say her husband ate poison. Rat poison.’“‘Cold bitch to do that to a man.’“‘Fixin’ to warm her right up, Curly Bill.’“That was a fact. The pretty flowered scarf was gone and the Captain was tapinga strip of metal to the egg-smooth skin of her head. The Nigger explained thatwas the primary electrode; he told me that at the pull of a switch, 4500 voltsof electricity would boil her brain. Rhonda Belle sat in the Chair and quivered.The fat matron with the dishwater blonde hair unceremoniously pulled up RhondaBelle’s skirt and unfastened her nylon stocking and peeled it down her left leg,impatient as a lover. The skirt was so high we could see the rubber strapholding up her other stocking, and the white fabric of her panty rucked up inher crotch. Me and the Nigger looked hard but didn’t see the pussy hair curlingout. I reckoned maybe that body shave rule applied to Tutweiler gals after all.’“Oh my God!’ the Nigger sighed.’“Amen, Brother!’ I added.“We could see everything between the top of her stocking and the white panty.Meat the color of chicken breast at Sunday dinner. The tender, sweet kind.Rhonda Belle was tender, and she was sweet. I couldn’t believe they were aboutto kill her. I had an impulse to step forward and tell them to leave her alone.”“Bullshit,” I said. I just couldn’t see old Curly Bill going sentimental on acondemned piece of ass. Curly cocked his eyebrow at me. It wiggled like acaterpillar crawling across his brow.“God’s truth. I’d never seen a woman put to death. It stirred me, way downinside somewhere.” His eyes clouded and he looked away. The bastard seemed tohave feelings of some kind and I waited for them to subside.“Anyway. They fastened another metal electrode on her leg just below her knee.Clamped it on real tight with a butterfly nut. Her stocking was in a little heaparound her ankle. Then they took her ankles and set them in the wooden stocksand locked them in.”“Stocks? Why’d they do that, Curly? I mean she ain’t going nowhere.”“Holds ’em steady so they get an even burn.”“Oh.” That shut me up.“Yeah, and when they fix the ankles that way it spreads the woman’s legs. Opensthem right wide, and when that happened we could see all the way up.” Curly Billclearly relished this part.“What did you see, the famous wet spot?”“Nope. Looked like a nice fat jellyroll wrapped in white cotton cloth. TheNigger gave me a little elbow and we were both straining our eyes looking up herskirt, but we couldn’t see no wet spot atoll.”“So you really didn’t see that much, did you?”A smug look spread over Curly Bill’s wide face. “We saw plenty, Sonny. Plenty.You ever seen a woman sit on Sparky?”“Sure.”“You have! Where?”“Right here on Q-Wing. Girls from the college tours sit on Sparky everymonth…used to anyway. They’d sit up there and some of ’em would show theirpanties. It ain’t that much to see, unless you see one that ain’t wearing nopanty. Then it’s worth a real hard look.”Curly Bill rubbed his crotch and eyed me like he wasn’t too sure he was going togive up any more story. I’d have to prompt him.“Well? What was Rhonda Belle doing in the Chair, Curly?”“She weren’t doing a damn thing but sitting there warming the seat—legs spreadlike some honky-tonk tramp looking for a boner. Her forearms and wrists werestrapped down to the armrests on the Chair. There was a black rubber belt drawnacross her belly and another one that ran under her arms just beneath her bigole bazooms; made it so they were pouched up like a movie star’s titties. Shewas sticking them out like she was Jayne Fucking Mansfield on a casting couch.Bet you never seen no college girl wearing a set of death straps!”“Well…” I shrugged.“Damn right you ain’t seen no woman’s ass strapped to no goddamned ‘lectricchair. When they lay that belly strap acrost her gut and snap it tight, the gallets out a grunt like some stud just ran a ten-inch hardhead up her box.”“No shit! Why so tight?”“Because, idgit, when she rides the lightning, she arches her back just like shedoes when she comes. They got to hold that stuff down in the Chair, boy, or itwould be an obscenity. Decent folk don’t want to see no whore with her cuntraised.” He caught my look and quickly amended, “Not at an official proceedingat any rate.”“What were you and the nigger doing all this time?”“Sheeeeit. We was standing right there looking at her snatch with our tongueshanging out!”Curly stuck his tongue out and panted to give me the idea. I punched his arm.“Go on, man!”“OK, once they got her body restrained, then they ran another rubber strapacrost her forehead. So she was pretty well immobilized. Warden Hobbs stepped upright in front of Rhonda so she could see him and read off the execution orderfrom the Governor’s Office. He read it slow and clear, so she wouldn’t miss aword. When he was done Chaplain Curtis came in and read a few words from theGood Book over her.”“I wonder what she was thinking.”“I never found out. She had a chance to tell us but she was a quiet one. WardenHobbs approached her and asked her real nice if there was something she’d liketo say because if so she was welcome to speak up. She seemed to be contemplatingan answer. I was thinking she might crack wise and ask Hobbs to hold her hand,or sit on her lap or something. But she just said she didn’t have nothing to sayabout nothing. Very polite. Nice soft South’ren voice. The Nigger was realdisappointed. He’d been expecting a speech, he said. Captain Crowe had told himsome ladies get downright chatty at the last moment. Captain said the preacher’sdaughter ran on for more than twenty minutes about how hard liquor and sex wasthe cause of her trouble. She’d finished up her story by giving everyone acharming smile and going ‘…and here I am.’”“Wow. What happened to the preacher’s daughter?”“Same as what happened to Rhonda Belle Martin. Warden Hobbs gave a nod to one ofthose big bull daggers that rode up from the Women’s Pen and she walked right upto the Chair and commenced to pushing wads of cotton up Rhonda Belle’s prettynose.“The fat matron went right to work at it. She’d take a wad of cotton out of ablue box and work it into Rhonda Belle’s nostril, then jam it on up there as faras she could with her finger. Didn’t wear no rubber glove or nothing. Stuffedthat cotton way to hell up there too. Me and the Nigger couldn’t hardly believeit when we saw it happening.”“What the hell was the reason for the cotton?”Curly Bill gave me a look of disgust. “So her fucking brains wouldn’t leak outof her nose, bozo. When they throw that switch and four or five thousand voltszap her in the head, the brain boils. And then it plain runs out your nose anddown the front of your shirt. Or in this case, you’d see her sweetmeatsdribbling down between her tits onto her lap.” He leered at me. His eyes had theevil glint of a jackal.“That’s disgusting!”“Happens all the time. You want to hear the story? Or maybe we’d better quitwhile we’re ahead.” He stood and hitched up his pants. “I don’t want you pukingup your Oreos, kid. Think you’re up to it? It ain’t no pretty tale.”“Naw, naw, Curly, I ain’t no pussy. I came here to hear a yarn and I’m a-gonnaset this one out. That is, if you’re still pouring coffee.”“Oh you finished already? Well I guess you been drinking while I been yapping…”he was teasing me. “I reckon I could fix another cup, if you’re gonna stickaround.”“Yeah, Curly, come on and run the story. I want to hear it.”Curly settled the stinger for another round and continued. “The other fat dykehad an ass on her like a John Deere tractor. She was cramming cotton into RhondaBelle’s ears with the eraser end of a number two lead pencil. Sometimes thebrains squirt out the ears too, you know?”My mouth twisted with disgust. “How’d the girl react to all that poking into herhead?”“Howled like a fucking maniac is what she did. She was having a regular damn fitand shrieking ‘What are you doing? What are you doing?’ over and over like abusted Victrola record. The two matrons didn’t pay her no mind. They were asbusy as a son-of-a-bitch pulling cotton from the blue boxes and making itdisappear into Rhonda Belle.“While they were packing her, the two matrons were clucking and crooning, ‘Bestill now! Act like a lady! This don’t hurt! This is for your own good! Behaveyourself!’ and happy horseshit like that. And I’ll tell you something else whathappened just then.”“What?”“The Nigger leaned forward and lowered his voice. Muttered, ‘Curly Bill’ towardthe floor. I leaned toward him to catch it. ‘You reckon they’ll pack her hole?’he whispered.“The Nigger said that right there in the execution chamber?”“Sure, he was a sex freak, remember?”“Yeah, I see what you mean.”“I said I’d never heard of no such thing, but I kinda hoped they would, now thatI got to thinking about it.” Curly slurped his Java. “What the Nigger said nextwas even more interesting.”“I’m on the edge of my can.”“Nigger said, ‘If they put something in her hole, I’ll be obliged to take it outlater.’ And I looked over at him and saw that he was serious. I could see it inhis bugged-out eyes. His mouth was wet with spit because he kept licking hislips.”“Pure freak for that hot pussy, huh?”“Hell yeah. By then Rhonda Belle was screaming and trying to wriggle out of theChair. She wasn’t getting nowhere, just howling like a bitch. Her nose was swoleup with the cotton. She was crying. Tears running down her cheeks making wettrails through her make-up. She was a pitiful sight. We were watching it close,taking it all in. The Nigger whispered to me, ‘That there be a real cunt, Man.’I gave him a look, trying to make out where he was coming from, and he came backreal quick. ‘Curly Bill, in here you can get a boy to suck your dick; you canbend him over and get you some shithole, but where you gonna get you some realpussy at Holman Penitentiary? Where else but right here?’”Curly Bill paused and looked straight at me, waiting for me to say something.“He had a point, I suppose.”“Bet your cracker ass he had a point. I told him I wasn’t too sure about what hewas getting at. I said Rhonda was wired for the electric enema, and that put meoff my feed, so to speak.”“Did I miss something? They give her an enema?”“That’s what they call it when they hit you with 4000 volts and it blows theshit right out your ass and down your leg. I had heard of it. There was a goodchance I was about to see it. That is, unless the bull daggers put cotton upRhonda’s asshole. Now don’t get me wrong. I like a boy to suck me off same asanyone in the joint. But I told the Nigger that dipping my wick in some whore’sshit wasn’t my idea of an afternoon delight. But the Nigger had an answer forthat.” Curly smirked and sat back.“What was the Nigger’s remedy?” I prodded, intrigued.“The black son-of-a-bitch said the electric enema weren’t nothing at all. Hesaid, ‘I’ve got me a water hose back there and I’ll just spray some over herhole, wash it off real nice, and she’ll be ready to ride. That juicy thing isgonna be as hot as a two-dollar pistol on a Saturday night.’”“That makes sense,” I commented judiciously.“Damn right it makes sense. So I told that slimy fucker that maybe I’d go onback there and give it a closer look after he’d rinsed her off. Maybe hit astroke or two. You should have seen those rubber lips smile. That boy wasgrinning like a weasel in a hen house.”“He knew he was gonna get him some white pussy now.”“Yup, sure as hell did,” Curly Bill snorted.“Did the prison matrons put cotton up her butt?”“Nope, those bulldaggers didn’t fool around with that. I figured they’d diveright into her panties and straight up her hole. But they never messed withher.”“Too bad, that would’ve been a sight to see.”“Yeah. There was nothing to look at but the panties, so I looked up at her eyesand they were like Billy had said: large and brown and wet with tears. Andmiserable. She knew she was on her way to wherever fried cunt goes, and shewasn’t too anxious to take that ride. Those eyes. They were desolate. ThenCaptain Crowe covered her face with the rubber death mask and she started going,‘Oh. Oh. Oh.’ behind the mask. The strangest sound you ever heard a woman make.”“Sounds like it took a long time to get her ready.”“Well, not really. The event moved right along. Everyone seemed to know justwhat to do. They’d had plenty of practice. They burned men regular at Holman.Women only came in once in a while but it went down smooth enough. When the fatmatrons were done, Warden Hobbs walked around the Chair giving Rhonda Belle aclose inspection. He checked the straps and apparently he liked what he saw. Hethanked the two dykes from the Women’s Penitentiary for their assistance andasked Captain Crowe to show them to the door.“Back then the only woman allowed to see an execution was the guest of honor,and she didn’t really see it. The two matrons took one last fond look at RhondaBelle and waddled on off with the Captain. Warden Hobbs waited until the dykeswere clear of the room, then he turned and looked thoughtfully at Rhonda Bellesitting there on the Chair making her funny little noises. It was so weird. Shekept going, ‘Oh. Oh. Oh.’ over and over, and making a noise like a hiccup. She’dtwitch, and she was sort of trying to wriggle around. She had the Warden’sattention. He watched her for a minute like he was memorizing her reactions.He pursed his lips and scratched behind his ear. Then he turned and gave a nodtoward the black drape hanging off to one side.”“What’s that for?” I asked.“The executioner stands behind it, and when he gets the nod he pulls theswitch.”“And he got the nod….”“He damn sure did. One moment Rhonda Belle was wriggling around making squeakynoises, and a second later she was slammed forward into the straps so hard itmade the leather creak. She came up off that Chair like a gymnastical gal tryingto arch her body toward the roof.” Curly Bill was checking me out, to see if Igot the picture.“She came right up off the Chair?”“Damn right! They gave her a straight shot of 4500 volts and when the power tookher, it lifted her up and tried to fling her right out of the Chair.”I could just see it. Curly Bill was smacking his lips, warming to his topic.“When those straps bit into her, she gave a grunt like someone hit her a punchin the belly, and at the same time she let go a fart. A real ripper, lewd andunladylike. And listen to this: a jet of pee squirted right through the whitecrotch of her panty like it was coming from a pressure hose.”“You mean it shot out in front of her? How far would you say?”“A coupla feet at least. Came jetting right out. Made a little pool in front ofthe Chair and between her legs. Her butt was maybe six inches off the Chair. Thepee wet her pants and dribbled. There was only that first jet that came through,when they put the juice to her. She didn’t pee a whole lot, just that littlepuddle for her behind to sit in when it came down. Course, when the panty gotwet we saw the crack. The McCoy. I recollect it perfect to this very day.” CurlyBill was licking his lips, and I imagined that the bright look in his eyes wasnot too different from the one he had seen in Nigger Jack’s.“Is it true what you heard about the electric enema?”Curly Bill sucked in his breath. “Oh, it’s true all right. All the shit upinside Rhonda leaped right out her asshole and slithered around inside herdrawers like a damn snake. The turd came out and coiled up in her pants. Made‘em sag with the load until they drooped down and touched the seat under her.The stink was vile. It rose up from under her and radiated around the room.There is no smell like it on this earth. Smoke was coming off her head. Herflesh was sizzling like bacon at the electrodes and her drawers were full ofshit. The stench would gag a maggot.“The Nigger’s eyes were popped wide. He said, ‘Curly Bill, that’s what they callthe electric enema.’ I didn’t know what to say. Then he said, ‘Don’t let it putyou off none. All that washes off. I’ll take care of that.’ You see, he wascoming on strong. He wanted that white pussy, and he’d do just about anything toget her. He knew I was standing between him and her, and he was working on methe only way he knew how.”“He was trying to work you up so you’d want a little piece yourself.”“Right. And he could see I was about to go a little green around the gills fromsmelling her frying flesh, so right away he started in on that.”“The smell?”“Yeah. He said, ‘Curly Bill, did you smell her perfume when they brought herin?’ I gave him a nod while drilling my eyes on her body. It was changing colorfrom white to deep pink. She was turning colors like one of them lizards thatcan go from brown to green when they take a notion. Only she was going fromwhite to red. Her leg where the electrode was around it was as red as a lobsterin a pot above the electrode and white as a catfish belly beneath.”“She was changing colors while you were watching her?”He nodded. “She was cooking between the electrodes is why. A big ole burnblister rose up on her leg just above the electrode cuff. It swole up withliquid and then it popped and smoke rose up from it. The watery stuff soakeddown into the cuff and hissed like a snake. Steam came up in a white cloud.Smelled so awful I could feel my dinner coming up on me.”I stared at him. He was really into the story. His lips were curled up in agrimace as if recoiling from the stench of frying flesh.“Curly Bill. Didn’t the Nigger say something about her perfume?”“Oh yeah,” he sniffed unconsciously. Maybe that cleared out the memory of thedeath stench, because his face relaxed. “Nigger Jack told me she put perfume onher tits and in the crack of her behind.”“How’d he know?”“He watched her through the security mirror.”“What’s that?”“It’s where the prison officials watch a woman when she’s naked. They watch herwhen she takes off her prison uniform and puts on her execution clothes.”“The men watch her?”“Sure they do. That’s security. Suppose she jumps on those matrons? Anythingcould happen in that room. She could kill them two matrons in there and who’dknow? They got to watch.”“Makes sense. But it must really embarrass the woman.”“Well they do it in a polite way, so she don’t feel embarrassed.”“Who watches?”“Oh, the Captain and whoever else he lets come in to see the strip show,” CurlyBill chuckled. “He would have killed the Nigger if he knew he was watching thewhite woman, but Nigger Jack slipped his sneaky black ass into the room whileCaptain Crowe was off checking on the death straps and had himself a nice longlook. That Nigger, he got him an eyeful, and he was giving me an earful.”“Wanted to get your cock up for Rhonda.”“That’s it. He said he’d watched the white lady shave the hair off her cunt. Shesquatted on the toilet and soaped it, then she shaved it, washed it by pouringwater from a plastic cup over it, and patted it dry with a paper towel. Thenwhen she was done she stood up and the fat matron handed her a little bottle ofperfume and Rhonda Belle put some on her finger and went up behind her ears withit. She dabbed a bit on her neck, then ran her finger down smack between herteats. Lifted up each titty and put a dab under each one. Finally she rubbedsome between her legs and reached around and drew her finger up the crack of herass. The Nigger told me he took out his cock and jacked off into his bandannajust from the sight of her.”“Think he was lying?”“Nope. I saw the look on his face.” Curly Bill took out a cigarette paper andsprinkled some Kite tobacco onto it. He rolled it, licked it and fired it up. Hepuffed away at it, recollecting Rhonda’s perfume.“Nigger tell you anything else he saw?”“They took away her brassiere. Made her go to the Chair without it.”“That’s weird,” I remarked. “Why?”“No metal is supposed to be between the electrodes. None at all. The brassiereshe had been wearing had metal fasteners and stuff on it, so they confiscated itfrom her. They made her wear special underpants too.”That got my interest. “Special in what way?”“The Nigger knew all about it. He told me the panties the state issues convictwomen have elastic at the waist and leg. The elastic melts when they cook thegal, so before she comes up here, they sew up a special panty for her, one withno elastic. It’s got drawstrings like one of them bikini suits Brigitte Bardotwears.“So after Rhonda Belle was shaved and perfumed, the matron tied the bikini onher ass. They knotted that sucker up tight too. We had to slice it with a razorto get it off.”“So you did get to see her pussy!”“Saw it? Damn right I did. I saw it snuggled up in her panty when she was alive.I saw it squirt pee when they ran the lightning through her. I saw her raisethat pussy up off the Chair like a woman ready to fuck. And I saw it bleed—”“What do you mean, bleed?”“What I mean is…she was arched up in the straps and turning red as a cookedbeet. Her hands were curled into grotesque claws with her fingers angling out inevery which way. She was shaking so hard her shoes fell off and her toes werecurled up like she was coming hard. She was sizzling like a pan of fried meat.Up inside her belly some female part of her must have burst, because the bloodrushed out from her. It gushed from her hole, it soaked her panties dark red.Made a pool on the Chair and dripped onto the floor.”I took a deep breath. I was trying to think of some reasonable explanation. “Itmust have been her time of month, Curly Bill.”“Nope. For that they put the woman on the rag. She wasn’t on her period. Shejust busted up inside and the blood ran out her cunt, that’s all.”“That is totally fucking gross.” Curly Bill’s story was starting to get to me. Istarted to tell him to stop, but I figured it couldn’t get any worse. Curly Billlooked like he was in another world, like he was actually seeing the wholedisgusting spectacle and couldn’t tear his eyes away.“Now you know why they don’t let ladies come in and see the executions. Even agirl reporter might be upset by a sight like that.”“You can bet the women will be here to watch Sonia Jacobs when she cooks.”“Yeah, and you can bet Sonia will have more cotton stuffed in her than a teddybear. This ain’t like the old days. Sonia won’t get no 4500 volts neither.”“What will she get?”“Not more than 2800 volts, about enough to just knock out her eyeballs.Damnedest thing you ever saw, eyeballs popping out of the head and hanging onthe cheeks by the optic nerve. Happens every time. Why do you think they makethem wear a mask?”“I guess I never thought about it, Curly Bill. Or at least, not enough.”“Sonia will have it easy compared to girls in the old days. They’ll stick cottonup her cunt, up her butt, let her wear a ministration rag to pee on, and giveher plastic pants to boot. Then they’ll tickle her to death with a measly couplethousand volts.” Curly Bill spat out a shred of tobacco on the floor.“1800 volts will kill you.”“Sure. After awhile, so will these RIP’s.” He blew smoke at me. “But RhondaBelle, they ran the power through her for three minutes, then quit. Rhonda Bellewent limp in the straps, sat down in her own fucking pile of slop as dead asanyone you ever did see. Doctor Garcia, the prison sawbones, was called in toexamine her. He told everyone she was dead. Captain Crowe said, ‘No shit,Sherlock?’ and the sawbones scuttled on out of there. The stench was so thickyou could almost see it; and it wasn’t Rhonda Belle’s Chanel we were smelling.That smell is really something. They ought to bottle it and make juveniledelinquents take a whiff every time they get to feeling ambitious.” Curlychuckled at his own little joke, and I urged him on.“So the fried lady was sitting there…”“Oh yeah. Well, Warden Hobbs yelled to Nigger Jack, ‘Git this damned mess out ofmy ‘Lectric Chair!’ and the Nigger comes back, ‘Yes sir, Mister Warden, sir!’ Heunfastened all the straps and buckles, then loaded her onto a metal gurney andwheeled her away to the back room.”“Where were the screws?”“The screws were fucking gone—long gone. The show was over and the audiencecleared out fast. Like I said, the place was stinking so bad, people were readyto puke. It’s a real bad smell.”“So nobody was around but you and Nigger Jack?”“Me and Nigger Jack—and Rhonda Belle.” Curly Bill grinned like the very Devilhimself. “We took that cutie into the back room and the Nigger got to workcleaning her up. He pulled down those nasty panties, cut the knots with hisrazor, and slid them off her ass. It was like he promised, exactly. He had hishose and he played it all around her hindparts. Steam rising off that hot ass,swear to God. Got after her with the lye soap. The mess came off her and wentdown the drain. He stuffed her soiled clothes into a bag. He poked her eyeballsback into their sockets and stuck a piece of adhesive tape over them to holdthem in.”“Why was he going to all that bother?”“That part was his job. He has to fix her up for the free-world undertaker. Butsoon as he was done with his job, he took her and draped her over a nail keg. Heput the garter belt back on her and attached the stockings. Her head was downand her bottom was up. There was a big smile on those nether lips. Smooth as ababy’s behind, and bright pink. The Nigger ran his hand over the full round assend of her. His hands real black against the bright pink of her behind.He took his fingers and dropped them down to the center of her pussy and spreadthe petals. It was a gentle gesture. Nigger Jack was very tender with Rhonda. Heasked me, ‘When do you figure she last had a man, Curly Bill?’”“You stood there let that Nigger handle her that way?”He shrugged. “Hell, I had my eyes on that pussy. You would too. That stufflooked real good—pink and soft. And there was no more nasty smell at all. Shewas nice and clean from the soap job the Nigger gave her. I got up a littlecloser to her, and I caught a whiff of her perfume too.”“She was dead.”“Fresh off the Chair, Sonny. And still hot—about 106 degrees and cooling fast.”“But she was dead, Curly Bill, dead!”He paused a beat. “More like dead drunk, actually. She weren’t stiff, and shedidn’t smell bad at all. That Chanel on her neck…”I licked my lips. Puffed out my cheeks. Held my peace while I waited for him tocome back.“It was the Nigger that did it. Had him a hard-on from sticking his hands inRhonda’s privates to clean her. He started to rub on it, then opened his pantsand took it out. He spit in his hand and rubbed it on his dick. Then he justturned around and stuck his Johnson right up her poop chute.”“Cornholed her?”“As I live and breathe. I watched him.”“What did you say to the black bastard?”“I told him I had first dibs on her cunt,” he answered with a straight face.“First dibs,” I repeated. “Then you fucked a woman who just got off the ElectricChair?”“I never said that,” Curly Bill disclaimed.“Was it good?”A look at Curly Bill’s long yellow teeth was my only answer.I got up off the buttcan and stretched. “I think I’ll get moving, Curly Bill.”“Oh? What’s the big rush, Sonny?”I looked him in the eye and said, “I’m going down to see the Death House Captainabout an orderly job.”“Figuring you might get that job?”I nodded. “Sonia. I’ve seen her picture. I’m in love. Hearing what you say, I’mready to give it a try my own self. I know I’ll never get me no more live pussy.So what the fuck.”“You can forget Sonia,” Curly Bill said, a little smile curling one side of hismouth.“Oh? Why is that?”His curious smile became an outright leer. “Because the job’s been took already.They gave it to the only convict in this joint with experience handling a burntwoman.”“You!” I whispered.“Yup. Me. And when it’s done, come on down and I’ll tell you how she was.” CurlyBill gave me a big wolfish smile as I turned on my heel and went back to my owncell.image [Images/174a.jpg]image [Images/174b.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"ACTUAL FANTASIESThe stories and drawings in this section were among those seized by police froma closet in Schaefer’s mother’s home, and used to convict him of murder in 1973.MURDER PLANIn order to remain unapprehended, the perpetrator of an execution-style murdersuch as I have planned must take precautions.One must think out well in advance a crime of this nature, in order for it towork. We will need an isolated area, accessible by a short hike, away from anypolice patrols or parking lovers.The execution site must be carefully arranged for a speedy execution, once thevictim has arrived. There will be 2 sawhorses with a 2x4 between them. A nooseis attached to the overhanging limb of a tree. Another rope to pull away the2x4, preferably by car.A grave must be prepared in advance away from the place of execution.The victim could be one of the many women who flock I to Miami and Ft.Lauderdale for the winter months. Even two victims would not be difficult todispose of, since women are less wary when traveling in pairs. In any case itmay be more preferable to bind and gag the victims before transporting them tothe place of execution.Then again, depending on what torture or defilement is planned for them, otheritems may be useful.Bars of soap & water. These are useful if you would want to wash a woman beforeher execution. Induce her to urinate and then wash her.image [Images/175.jpg]Soap provides an excellent lubricant for anal intercourse.Beer is useful to induce urination and make the victim groggy and morecooperative. Soap can also be forced into the rectum to induce defecation if thevictim has no particular desire to relieve her bowels. Possibly she may want todefecate, since people generally have a desire to do this when they are scared.A douche bag may be helpful in degrading her further, and is also useful for asoapsuds enema which would be a great indignity, especially if one victim wasmade to urinate or defecate on the other. This would be a gross indignity.Nylon stockings are useful to tie the hands and feet of the victim. The victimshould be made to strip at least to her underwear. If stripped completely nudean attempt can be made to excite her sexually. This effect would be especiallyinteresting if the victim had her neck in the noose and hands tied behind herback.A white pillow case should be placed over her head and her mouth gagged. Herpanties should be pulled down enough to expose the genitals, and clitoralstimulation applied. During the height of her excitement the support should bepulled away and she should dangle by her neck.She may be revived before death if desirable and subjected to furtherindecencies. After death has occurred, the corpse should be violated if notviolated already. The body should then possibly be mutilated and carried to thegrave and buried. All identity papers should be destroyed and the place ofexecution dismantled.INTO THE MIND OF THE GHOULI walk into the bar and look around. There is something special that I amlooking for, or should I say someone special. A woman with that look about her,that look of wildness, uncaring, a willingness to do anything for a price. Awhore or someone like one.I have to be sure she is the right one because one blunder could be the end forme. When I find the one that I’m looking for, I have to be sure throughconversation. I’ll make sure that no one notices me and then I’ll make my offer.And if she accepts she has signed her death warrant.Everything has been arranged long before in preparation of this event. I takeher for a ride. I am cordial enough and make no threatening motions. I give herno reason to become alarmed. I drive out to the place that I am going to leavemy car, I a place I have left it many times before, so as not to draw suspicion.I could be an ordinary traveler out of gas or taking a nap on the side of theroad. Nobody would think differently, not even the police. That is important.I pull over and casually say that we are here, and for her to get out. Maybe itis then that she starts to worry because of the fact that we are in the middleof nowhere. Maybe it is then that I have to show her the gun and remind her ofthe consequences for disobedience. If she knew what lay in store for her, shewould gladly choose the bullet.I have traveled over this trail before so the darkness is of little hindrance.The trail is well hidden. No one has ever been down it before, because of thedesolate location and the thickness of the jungle around it, but with littledifficulty I know where the trail is and where it goes.Deep in the swamp is a huge tree with limbs strong enough walk on. It iscompletely surrounded by jungle. This is the place I seek. I have been theremany times before, only those times it was in rehearsal and there was no victim,only the fantasy of it all. But I do know what will be done and how to do itstep by step.The woman is by this time very frightened. This is good, because the morefrightened she is, the greater the thrill for me. I tell her to strip, but I lether leave her underwear on. I tie her to a branch and gag her if she is toonoisy while I go about the business at hand.I bring over the white sheet and a pillowcase to go over her head. I explainthat I am going to hang her and she might as well accept the fact and cooperate.The gun is persuasive and there is always hope, so she cooperates. The limbs arearranged perfectly for the deed, all the right height and distance apart. It hastaken a long time to find the right tree and the right person, but I finally didit.I arrange the rope and the noose and I dress the woman in the white shroud,place the pillowcase over her head, and then if I feel like it, sit down andentertain her with a bit of my conversation. Terrorize her. Give her my ideas onwhat she will look like while she is hanging there, fighting the rope that isslowly choking the life out of her. Make it as real as possible for her, so thatshe is petrified with fear. Make her know that she is going to die.The noose is arranged so that she will strangle slowly, and she sits on a boardbetween two limbs with a long rope leading off into the jungle. When it is time,I will go off into the jungle and pull the rope and she will hang.Then I will go home to have something to eat, and bright and early the nextmorning I will be out hunting. I will find the body hanging from the tree andonly then will I really notice it. Maybe fondle it and maybe even have coituswith it. I will notice the expression on the face, the position of the body,explore every nick and cranny of her, maybe mutilate her and delight in thesmell of any urine or excrement that she may have passed while hanging there.I leave and then return so it will be unbelievable to myself that I did thedeed. I will not be able to remember doing it. Funny isn’t it.Then after many hours I will dispose of the body in a place that has never beenseen by man, and it will soon rot away in the tropical heat, with the help ofthe bugs and vermin, the rats and raccoons that abound here.This is what I intend to do, but I do not know why.There is a drive within me so powerful that it completely takes over my sense ofreason and values. I am at the mercy of this insane maddening drive to committhe ultimate crime of horror, and only when it is done will I be at rest. I haveto fight off this desire every day of my life. Why? Why? That is the question.If I could understand what causes these emotions then I might be able better tocombat them.I do positive things to prevent this happening. I stay away from bars, thebeach, dances, anywhere that I might come in contact with that person that mightput me over the edge. Twice this has nearly happened, but both times my sensesprevented disaster before I had gone too far.Once I picked up a girl at the beach and took her to a place that I had pickedout for just such an occasion. She stood beneath the limb that she was going tohang from and somehow I just prevented myself from exposing what it was I had inmind. She was really frightened, and I was so nervous that I could barely speak.This was accompanied by violent headaches, and even as I recall this informationto put on paper, I am plagued by headaches and a ringing in my ears.I have been tempted to do away with other women too, usually ones that I amsexually attracted to but do not know personally. One girl whom I almost killedI later became good friends with and drove her to the airport to fly up north.It was an experiment to see if I still wanted to kill her after I got to knowher, and I didn’t. In fact, I am still rather fond of her.Once while in high school I playfully strangled a girl into unconsciousness, andhave longed for the feeling it gave me ever since. I have always liked the ideaof strangling women. But I never do, because I am afraid I will be caught andconfined. The idea of confinement is horrifying to me. I don’t mind death, andhave often thought about suicide. But it is the idea of confinement that keepsme from doing anything on the spur of the moment.Often when I was sexually attracted to a woman and wanted to kill her I wouldsteal her clothes and dress up in them, and then hang myself instead. This is alittle risky, but I have only been caught at it twice by strangers, and Imanaged to wiggle out of it both times. I used to have piles of women’s clothesthat I stole, but it got to where I didn’t have anywhere to keep them, so I haveto work with a minimum amount now. There was a time that I had wardrobes ofclothes in trunks out in the forest, but then one day a forest fire destroyedthe area, and I had to start all over.Hanging seems to be the most exciting way of dispatching a victim, but in apinch I would resort to strangulation. I can’t explain why. The experience ofimagining a woman hung produces intense sexual excitement. It is always the samething: the preliminaries to the woman being hanged, and then ejaculation as shevanishes through the imaginary trap.Recently I have become seriously emotionally attached to a girl and she to me.We have experienced coitus together on several occasions. I always feel for hera deep and strong love, and will marry her if all works out in the future. But Iam not completely emotionally wrapping myself up in her, so in the event thatsomething does happen I won’t do anything foolish.When we make love, it leaves us both feeling terrific and unguilty. But the onlyway that I can experience an orgasm is to think of that woman going through thetrap and hanging there. I can make love all night and never lose the erectionunless I think of that hanging woman. I merely wait until my girl is beginningto climax, and then I think of the woman hanging and I automatically climaxmyself. This bothers me but it doesn’t take away the deep and intense feelingthat I have for the girl that I make love to.It has long been known that men ejaculate when hanged. A favorite method ofself-gratification, used in the Middle Ages and still today, is what might becalled do-it-yourself hanging. The sensation of choking produces an erectionthat culminates in a violent orgasm, sometimes during the dying process. Thisstimulation has not been lost on the sexually perverted, who constantly castabout for more intense pleasures to replace whipping, self-scourging, biting andthe like.The maniacal rapist murderer represents the unholy marriage between sex anddeath. I wonder if he understands his act. I don’t understand it, even thoughthese same feelings are occurring within me all the time. I would like to beable to free myself from this world, because it inhibits my creative ability. Mymind cannot function properly when it is preoccupied with averting a socialcalamity and a personal tragedy. It is trying to fight the urge to relieve theseterrible cravings. I am sure that there must be an answer somewhere, and someday I will be cured.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------image [Images/179.jpg]This is mainly a European method of execution by hanging. The woman is pulled upwhile on a dais. The hangman controls the strangulation. The woman is pulled upuntil she loses consciousness, then lowered in order to regain her senses, thenhauled up again. The procedure for men convicted of high treason in England wasto be hauled up naked and strangled to the verge of death, causing the culpritto have an erection. The man was then castrated and disemboweled. The bowelswere burned before the prisoner in a brazier. The brazier here is marked RIP.This sketch shows a pre-disembowelment hanging for a German woman during the18th Century. Instead of disembowelment, Englishwomen were publicly stripped,slathered with lard, hanged on a stake and set afire.Naturally nobody bothered to ask me what this doodle means. I suppose the policefigure the executioner is me and the woman is one of my alleged victims. Ormaybe they just like lurid depictions of State-sanctioned violence.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------POWERLINE ROADWe drove out Powerline Road. It was about 9 a.m. She was making with the smalltalk and I was attempting not to appear nervous. I was wondering who she had told and how much she had told. I was pretty sureshe had blabbed to someone because that would be just like her. We turned offonto a dirt road. I knew where we were going. I asked her to put on a blindfold.She was nervous. Said she was scared and had an uneasy feeling. She said it wasbecause of all the killings recently and such. I told her there was nothing toworry about which was a lie, and we drove off into a field.When we got to where I wanted to go I stopped and we got out. She still had theblindfold on so I helped her. We walked about ten yards and I said to standstill, because I forgot something in the car. I went back and got a sack filledwith lead weights, walked up and hit her on the back of the head. She wasstunned a little and I hit her again.Then she started to try to protect herself and fell to the ground screaming“Don’t hit me. Please don’t hit me.” I was shaken because of her pleas and Wdidn’t hit her. I helped her up and said I was sorry and that I had beeninstructed to put her out. She had messed us up once before and now we didn’ttrust her.I asked her who she had told and she said nobody. I said we know she had toldsomeone, and she became a little worried but still would not admit tellinganyone.She was sitting on an orange crate and when I put the pillow case over her headshe complained so much that she couldn’t breathe, I took it off. As she satthere she kept complaining about being dizzy and feeling faint. I would justtell her to shut up.I tied her hands behind her and put a noose over her head that I had put up theprevious afternoon. It had rained that day and the rope was wet and didn’ttighten properly. I tightened it as best I could but the noose wouldn’t slip. Iwould pull the rope up occasionally to hear her beg.She must have been really scared. She was sitting in the sun and sometimes shewould forget about her legs and let them come apart, giving me a good look upher dress.She finally asked what had probably been going through her mind for some time.“Are you going to kill me?” I told her that I didn’t know, that it wasn’t up tome and the people responsible were deciding her fate right now. I said she hadmade too many mistakes and her mouth was too loose and we had people watchingher constantly. It didn’t look good for her. There was silence for awhile. Thenshe asked me “Is it quick?” and I asked her, “Is what quick?”“Hanging. Aren’t they going to hang me? They’re going to hang me aren’t they?”“No,” I lied. “I don’t know what they’re going to do.” At that point I didn’tknow, because I was beginning to feel sorry for her. Then she said, “I have togo to the bathroom.”“There isn’t one around, you’ll have to wait.”“I have to go bad. Couldn’t you just let me go back in bushes?”“No. I have my orders but I’ll let you squat right here if you want.”“No. I couldn’t. I’d be too embarrassed.”Ho! I thought to myself. You embarrassed. No chance.“Then you’ll just have to do it in your pants. What do you have to do anyway?” Iwas hoping she had to shit.“Never mind,” she said, and that was that.I went to where I said a man with a radio was and left her sitting on her achingbladder. When I came back a rain squall started to fall. The rope wouldn’t comeloose from around her neck and I said I’d have to back up to get some slack. Shethought I would haul her up then and begged me not to. The rope was tied to thebumper of the car. I finally worked the rope loose and we sat in the car allwet.I told her they had decided to kill her. She was really scared and begged me tohelp her escape. I said I would do what I could. The rain stopped and I told herI was to take her to a grave that had been dug for her. I said she should fake afaint and I’d carry her over to the grave area. I wanted to force her to pee herpants with my shoulder in her gut. I carried her over and set her down.I let her see the hole I had dug for her. She really got scared then, and I wasafraid she might panic and start fighting since she was not tied around the legsand only loosely about the hands. I told her to lay down on the ground and Iwould try to think of something.She said if I let her go that she’d pay me all her savings, leave town, neversay a word to anyone, give me anything I wanted. She was desperate. Almost intears.She said, “I don’t want to die. I think I’m pregnant. I love Buddy and I want tohave a baby.” I told her to shut up. Then I told her to strip.“Why do I have to strip?”“Because it’s the way we do things. We never kill anyone and leave their clothesso they can be identified by them. We make ’em all strip. If you don’t want meto help you, forget it. We’ll strip you after you’re dead.”I cut her hands loose and she began to strip out of her clothes.“I’ll shoot a hole through the dress and show it to the other guy and he’llthink I killed you.”She was stepping out of her white waitress dress. “Get off the slip too,” Isaid. She stepped out of it too and was standing there in her brassiere,pantyhose and bikini panties and shoes. Her jugs were big, almost popping out ofthe bra. “Kneel down,” I said. She knelt.I put the gun next to her head and shot a hole through the dress. I thought shemight shit her pants in fear, but she didn’t. I said, “I need blood,” and shewanted to cut her finger, but I decided the hole in the dress would look goodenough.I told her to lay on a sheet I had brought and she did, stomach down, her bigass sticking up. Very sexy. I told her to wait while I checked with the otherguy.I walked around, still undecided whether to kill her or not. I could see her andthen she did the thing that sealed her doom. She picked up the blindfold andlooked around as she lay there. I decided then for sure she couldn’t be trusted,and I would have to kill her. I didn’t know if she could see me or not.When I got back I told her the other guy wanted to see her body and take hervaluables. I told her to give me her jewelry. She took off two rings and layback down. I told her the other guy was coming, so she’d better play dead or shewould be dead. Then I went to the car and took out the pistol and cocked it soshe wouldn’t hear it.I went over near her and aimed the gun at the base of her head. I aimed a longtime. Then I closed my eyes and pulled the trigger. When I fired I ran.I ran around to the car and then worked my way back as if I was going todiscover her body. She was still laying there with no visible sign of injury.Her body was still and one leg was a little drawn up. I couldn’t see herbreathe, but her head moved slightly and I felt repulsed, horrified and ashamedall at the same time.I quickly raised the gun and shot her twice in the back of the head. This timeblood spurted out and I turned away. I covered her head with a sheet so I didn’thave to see the blood, and went and got several crates. These I arranged tostretch her out on.I went to the car and stripped down. Came back nude and grabbed her around theankles and pulled her up onto the crates. I then slipped my hands under theelastic of her hose and panties, and pulled them down to her knees.The white cheeks of her ass no longer held tightly together by the pantiesslumped apart and I saw her purplish-pink colored asshole, which was open sowide I thought it was her cunt hole. I mean she had one hell of a big ass hole.I stuck a finger up it to see if there was any shit in her rectum. There wasnone. I stuck two, then three and I could almost stick four fingers across intothat giant asshole. There were a few blonde pussy hairs growing around it. Notlike one asshole I had seen with hair so thick around it you couldn’t see it.No, she had a beautiful hole.I pulled off her shoes, thinking it wasn’t right to cornhole a woman with herpanties down around her knees and a bullet in her head with her shoes on.I mounted her like a horse and let my dick go right into the open hole. It washot in there and I humped a few times and shot off long and hard. I had soapedher hole and she was slippery and wet which made it more exciting than ever.I fucked that hole as long as my dick would stay hard and then just sat on herbig ass warming my balls in the crack of her backside.Then I felt like I had to get rid of her fast, before somebody should come alongor a plane should see us. I unhooked her bra and reached down and squeezed hergiant teats and then slid off her. I grabbed her by her ankles and pulled heroff the crates, noticing her gaping hole and tightly stuck together cunt. Iwondered why she hadn’t pissed. Her panties were a little wet but not a lot.Probably a few drops squirted out of her when I carried her.I dragged her body to the open grave straddling it as I pulled her toward it.Her head was down and her arms were outstretched. When her chest was at the edgeof the grave, I gave a jerk and let her feet go. She dropped to the bottom ofthe pit with a terrible hollow thump. Her legs went up over her back because thehole was too short for her. She lay there with her head down and her feet andlegs up, one arm beside her and the other stuck straight up as if she werereaching up to get out.I then threw the bloodied sheet over her head and tossed in her shoes. Herpanties were halfway to her knees as were her pantyhose. Her bra was unhooked onher back, the shoulder straps still in place. I jumped down into the grave andpulled her corpse forward. The legs still wouldn’t fit. Her cunt was mashedagainst the far end of the grave.I pulled her legs forward and this pulled tight the hair on her twat and madeher pussy open slightly. The cheeks of her ass were accentuated. I noticed atrickle of piss squirting from her cunt. I was barefoot. I stuck my big toe upher cunt hole and pushed it in. I could feel it enter her still hot body. Then Irammed my entire foot into her cunt and felt the warm piss squish as I wiggledit in deeper. Then I pissed on her butt.I hopped out of the hole and began to fill it up. I pulled her legs up over herback as best as possible and then bent the calves down so her knees were thehighest point. I packed down the earth, covered the grave with pine needles andburned everything she had except her dress and slip. All her clothes went intothe grave with her.A week later I couldn’t believe I had done it so I went back and began to dig inorder to make sure it wasn’t just my imagination. When I got to her knees thestink began. It was unbearable. God, did she smell. I dug all the way down toher cunt. Her legs were beginning to turn a mottled yellow color and the hairwas beginning to fall off her cunt. I filled the hole but first masturbated onher corpse.Several times I dug her up and every time the stench was so bad I couldn’t bearto complete the job. You see, I wanted her head. I had planned to cut it offafter I killed her, but I couldn’t do it. I had to get the head because of thedental records if she was ever found.Finally one day I managed to dig her up many months later. She was very wellpreserved, but drew a lot of flies. She was very greasy to touch. I slipped anoose around her neck and hauled her up a limb. She still had some hair in hercrotch and her cunt was well preserved. Her toes and fingers were beginning torot off but the rest of her was in good shape. I hauled her to a kneelingposition and cut off her head with a machete. The corpse slumped to the groundvery sexily showing her still wide open asshole.I took the head and wrapped it. The eyes were closed with the skin lids. Thenose was flat and the lips drawn back over the teeth in a snarl. I knocked outsome of the teeth but the head with hair on it smelled so bad I decided just tosink it in a canal along with her panties, hose and brassiere.The last I checked she had rotted away to nothing but her torso from her waistto the remnants of her backside. Oddly enough when her body swelled up duringdecomposition the gas must have pushed a load of shit down into her return,because when I examined her hole with a stick it came out all shitty.She’s still there now in her unmarked grave and sometimes I feel sorry not somuch for her as her family because it seems they must have really cared abouther. She was a whore and a tease and was no good and I’m sorry too that I didn’tspend more time enjoying her body while I had the chance, rather than justdumping it in a hole before it even became stiff.That was the first one and they say the first one is the hardest. So far thoughthe first one has been the best body-wise. I think there will surely be others.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------image [Images/184.jpg]This type of platform scaffold was popular circa 1800—1860. The one on NewgateStreet, London, could accommodate 27 prisoners per drop. The annotations acrossthe top refer to various categories of capital crime.Generally, women had the privilege to wear what they pleased to the scaffold.Fashion and style was set by the condemned; the hangman regulated thesuspension. A pre-hooding speech was expected.Platform scaffolds were also used in the United States; a single drop executed38 men in Minnesota in 1860, and mass platform hangings were common atBlackwell’s Island in New York City. The largest platform scaffold in use todayis at Pretoria Central Prison in the Republic of South Africa. Curiously, thescaffold is one South African public facility available for use by all racesequally.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------image [Images/185.jpg]This sketch represents a mass hanging of French partisans by Nazi Germans. Womenwere often stripped to their underwear or hanged nude with a short cord. Deathcomes by means of slow strangulation, since no drop is used. The maximum anguishis intended to have a deterring effect.The word gallows comes from the word gala. Mass executions were treated asfestivals in England until 1869. They were called Tyburn Fairs and wererecognized as holidays in the City of London.English hangmen were public celebrities. Albert Pierrepoint as Hangman for KingGeorge VII and Queen Elizabeth II executed notable criminal fiends and ran a pubin his spare time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------EXPECTING DINNERShe was expecting dinner, but instead was driven down a deserted road.She was asked to get out of the car and submit to a frisk search. Then thehand-cuffs were locked around her wrists and the blindfold placed over her eyes.She was then led away into the dark to the place of execution. She was assistedin mounting the ladder and sat down on the top of it. The hangman’s noose wasplaced over her head after a pillow case was dropped over her face in a hoodarrangement.She sat there very composed and ladylike while I adjusted the rope. Sheobviously had no inclination of what was about to happen. I told her somestories about Vietnam and then told her I had to make a radio call. I warned herif she made a sound that she would be hanged immediately.I went back to the car and had something to drink and then brought the car up. Igot out and tied the rope to the bumper so that if I pulled away it would pullout the ladder from beneath her and she would be left hanging.I went back to see her and asked if she were comfortable. She replied that shewas getting bored and would I please hurry up with whatever business I had toattend to. I said I would, and before I went back to the car I made sure thatthe rope S was tight around her neck.I wanted her to stand up but she was afraid, so I let her sit. She sat there ina black chiffon dress with her hair done up and black pantyhose and high heels.She was wearing perfume and was very sexy.I went back to the car and finished off the bottle of wine and then promptly at9 P.M. I started the car and after allowing it to run for a few minutes I threwit into reverse and backed up quickly. I turned off the car and got out,straining to see if the branches were moving in the trees or hear if there wereany other sounds. There were none.After fifteen minutes, which I judged to be a sufficient time for her to die, Iwent slowly forward into the grove of trees where the execution site wasarranged.It was nothing more than a road with a hangman’s noose over a limb danglingabove the ladder where she was to sit. I had a light but I almost didn’t want tosee what I was responsible for. I approached in the dark and could make out herbody turning slowly, suspended from the tree.I went forward and turned on the light. I was a little shocked. There was aconsiderable amount of blood staining the white pillowcase hood that was overher head. The noose was pulled tight around her neck and her head was tilted toone side because I placed the noose beneath her left jaw. When I was within afew feet of her body I could see that where her feet had been tied tightly, shehad broken the bounds obviously in her violent death throes. One of her shoeswas off. I was probably shaking as I slowly ran my hand up under her dress justabove her knees and began to work it upward. I felt a big hard-on growing in mypants as my hand traveled up her legs, still warm and very much alive to me. Theinside of her thighs were wet where she had urinated in her panties. Herunderpants and panty-hose were soaked. She was wearing her pantyhose over herpanties that were white nylon mesh and very skimpy. I lifted her dress and herwet slip and pulled down the pantyhose over her backside just leaving herpanties. I slipped my fingers beneath the rim of her panties down near the frontof her cunt and moved them slowly back toward her asshole, fully expecting andhoping to find a nice pile of shit.My fingers found the hair of her ass and inched toward her hole. Her hole wasopen and my finger easily slipped into her hot rectum. There was a small amountof excrement littering the crotch of her panties and some more clinging to thearea around her asshole but there was not nearly as much as I hoped to find.I went back to the car and stripped and then returned to the grove. I thenstripped off her dress and slip and pulled down her panties and hose to aroundher ankles. I then draped her body over a crate that I had brought along forthat purpose and fucked her up her asshole. I shot off almost at once and thenfelt very sorry for her.Oh, before I took down her body I forced myself to lift up the pillowcase hoodand look at her face. The face was swollen and a little mottled. The eyes wereclosed and swollen at the temples. Her mouth was open and her tongue was visiblebut not protruding much. I was sick at the sight but I left the hood off becauseof the blood which I didn’t like. After a few minutes I got on her again andfucked her ass some more. It was still hot in there and I shot off quickly onceagain. Then I stripped her and threw her clothes into a pile.I then carried her body over to where I had rigged up a toilet seat between twocrates and I sat her limp body on it. I then went down beneath the seat andstared up at her cunt and asshole, playing with them and fantasizing that shewas in the act of shitting or pissing.After a while I got tired of this and left her body on the toilet seat and wentback to the car where I think I slept. After a while I went back to her and whenI fucked her asshole again, for the first time noticed that she was getting coldon the outside but was still warm on the inside. Then I left her nude bodysprawled out on the ground with her ass sticking up in the air, sort of like shewas kneeling.I went back to the car and went to sleep again feeling sick to my stomach. LaterI woke up again and got out and went to her and stuck my prick in her ass again.This time I noticed that not only was her body getting cold, but it was alsogetting stiff too. I woke up cold and went to the car leaving her in the pineneedles after humping her hiney and then passing out over her dead nude body,some time before.The next time I woke up it was nearly daylight, so I went and took her bodywhich was becoming stiff down in the joints of the arms and legs, and dragged itover to the rope. I replaced the noose around her neck and hauled her up to seewhat she looked like in the gray daylight. She was too difficult to haul up veryfar so I took her down and hauled her up on a lower limb where I could supporther body as I was pulling it up. For the first time after removing her handcuffsI noticed that her wrists were very bruised, most likely from where she tried toget out of her predicament just before she died.Earlier I had lain beneath her and looked up her dress with a flashlight, butnow with her hanging there naked she was not too stimulating. I went to the carand got a woman’s slip and put it on her, then as she was suspended from therope I stood on a crate behind her and screwed her ass from behind. But it washard to keep her still on the end of the rope, because she kept wanting to swingout. Her body was cold by this time, and it was exciting in another way beingable to fuck her cold corpse.I got off in her ass once more and then since it was getting light, I took herdown and wrapped her up in a white sheet, and took her to the car. I dumped herbody in the trunk and picked up her things and wadded them up all except herpanties, pantyhose and slip, which were soaked with her piss. I wanted to savethese for souvenirs.I drove to another deserted spot and took her corpse out of the trunk wrapped upin the sheet. I half-dragged, half-carried it a good 200 yards into the bushalong a dike. She was very heavy now and it was real work just to move her. WhenI got to where I decided I wanted to dump her corpse, I opened the sheet androlled her out, noticing now in the full daylight that she was still wearing oneearring and a gold chain. These I took and threw into a canal. Her clothes Ialso threw into another canal, and then I rolled her corpse down the side of thedike into a palmetto thicket. In the daylight her corpse was very cold, stiffand grotesque. She had large bruises on her legs from where she probably kickedherself during her death throes. This together with the distorted face and herbruised wrists made her appear very unattractive.I propped her up as best I could and stuck it in her asshole again and thenturned her over.For the first time I really noticed the auburn V covering her cunt. I forced herstiff legs apart as best I could and screwed face to face, which was not easy,since she was very stiff and a little tight from the rigor mortis between herlegs. I finally got my nuts off in her and then I was exhausted.I sat for awhile and then decided to dump her body in the canal. I pulled herbody down to the water and pushed her in head first. Her auburn hair swam aroundher as she began to slip beneath the hyacinths. Finally the water came up overher butt and went into her asshole. I let her feet go and she sank beneath thewater.I went back to the execution site and cleaned up any traces of our having beenthere. Then I went to a rock pit, where I dumped her pocketbook and the sheetand a few rags and things. Then I went to Lum’s and had lunch on her money, anddidn’t enjoy it too much.About two weeks later I was curious as to whether she had floated to thesurface. I was horrified when I went to where she was dumped and saw her bodyswollen and bloated, tight-skinned, floating there. She was face down and herhair was covering her shoulders. Her ass was sticking way up in the air and Iwas looking right at what had been her cunt and asshole. The maggots hadevidently been at work on her, because there was a big hole from her cunt to thetop of the crack of her ass, and she stunk to high heaven. She was really putridwith all the flies buzzing and landing on her too. I poked her with a sticktrying to get her down under the lilies, but ended up having to pile lilies upon top of her to hide her corpse, which was a funny reddish color.Another few weeks and she was out from under the lilies again. I tried to sinkher with a few blasts from my shotgun. I would almost puke when I got a whiff ofher corpse. It was that bad. I would always go there and beat off toward her,just out of range of the smell. Eventually she began to rot away and every nowand then when I could stand the stink, I would drag her body out and try to mashit up with a stick. It seemed even the maggots didn’t want anything to do withher after a certain point.Finally I managed to break up the body and make it sink. I took the skull andlet the ants eat her brains out, if she had any, then I pulled out all the teethand scattered them over the county. The lower jaw I buried and the rest of herskull with the face smashed in and the teeth out, I put into another canal someten miles from the rest of her body. All in all she is probably scattered oversome thirty square miles, and I hope that she will continue to remain among theranks of the missing, even though there is no possible connection between us.image [Images/189.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------image [Images/190.jpg]This modern-style trap-drop gallows is designed with a glassed-in viewing portto accommodate the required witnesses.

Modern socially-conscious prison administrators are cognizant offeminine modesty and dignity: condemned females may be provided with a long gownwith ribbons attached. Once on the trap, the ribbons secure the skirt to preventbillowing at the drop. Brassieres are not worn at trap-drop hangings due to thedownward force of the plunge breaking the straps.Modern nations retaining capital punishment employ prison officials who striveto ensure that executions are perfectly humane, decently sanitary and suitablefor viewing by mixed company.

Schaefer sent this gleefully macabre sketch to Sondra London in October of1991, after having it autographed by serial killer Ottis Toole, who cracked,“Cut me off a slice.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"BEYOND KILLER FICTIONBEING CALLED GHOULISHimage [Images/192.jpg]There’s nothing to fire up one’s interest in ghoulism like being calledghoulish. Some years ago I wrote a story called “The Girl Ghouls of Galveston,” which wasa true tale about the monster hurricane that flattened that city in 1900. Thestory was about the expedition of New Orleans prostitutes sent to Galveston todo relief work. These women quickly turned to organized corpse robbing and werecaught by the military when the Army arrived on the scene.This entire boatload of whores was tried under martial law and executed by theArmy, and their corpses were burned. The women were tried and executed asghouls—in this case, corpse-robbers.When I was accused of being a ghoul, I had to look the word up to get a clearmeaning of ghoulism—which is defined in law as either robbing corpses or feedingon corpses. I wanted to clarify the distinction between a ghoul and a cannibal.I might mention that Ted Bundy took a pretty good bite out of that girl at theChi Omega house. Bundy bit off the girl’s nipple and ripped a hunk out of herbuttocks. I confess to wondering why he stuck a Clairol bottle up her butt. Wasit a “sexual attack” or simply a matter of plugging her up because he wasgnawing on her buttocks and she began to shit in terror? Rip a hunk out of herass and she’s going to bleed plenty. Did Ted relish the taste of blood?Was he a cannibal or a ghoul? Out in Washington they found this corpse withfresh lipstick and recently painted fingernails, but she’d been dead for severalweeks. She was rotten and decomposing. Ted admitted to doing her up on a regularbasis. What he was doing, having sex with rotting corpses, is incomprehensible.Oh, I’ve met guys in here who enjoy sex with a fresh young girl’s corpse. Theyare quite frank about it being perfectly OK with them. These fellows are usuallycaught in funeral parlors or working as ambulance attendants, and get bustedhumping a car wreck victim or such as that, but Bundy liked them nice and juicy,rotting and stinking. There’s a guy in here by the name of Giles who has thesame quirk. Pick up a chick, strangle her, set her out in the sun to ripen andthen climb aboard!I was talking to another serial killer in here the other day named Jerry Stano.He said he got more kills than Ted Bundy. I told him I had more than him and Tedput together. He could only blink his eyes and make a little “o” mouth like awhistle pucker. It hurt him.I told him he was a pussy to stab a hooker, and the only real way to do it isthe way the “Bow Boy” did them: tie their nylons around their necks and smellthe perfume behind their ears while they turn blue. Fucking Stano. With Tedgone, I’ve nobody to razz but him and Giles…who likes them dead. No reasonexcept he enjoys rotting pussy.I was accused of the exact same thing in 1973 on the front page of the PalmBeach Post. I cannot imagine a nastier accusation. Believe me, it’s very hard todefend against such charges—especially when they are made in the media but notin court. I wasn’t accused of being a rapist/killer, it was specifically anaccusation of fucking rotting corpses. I couldn’t even confront it objectivelyuntil about 1980. I’d read it and go into a mental fury. I mean, that’s ME righton the front page of the Sunday paper that Jack Nicklaus probably read. Buteventually I got up the intellectual fortitude to research the actualities ofthat accusation, and I did.image [Images/193a.jpg]It’s a well documented historical fact that a number of world leaders in Africannations have practice cannibalism: Jomo Kenyatta, Idi Amin, and Jean Bokassa arethree names that readily come to mind. While I’ve seen printed references totheir cannibalism, I’ve never seen one called a ghoul, so perhaps there is adistinction. The “savage cannibal” of Africa or Amazonia feasts on human fleshas a matter of choice, not of necessity. The major difference is in how thelocal social structure perceives the custom.Albert Fish, an American gent who enjoyed eating little girls, was tried andexecuted for murder—not cannibalism. Interestingly enough, it is not inviolation of law to eat human flesh in New York or Florida. Mr. Fish had a tastefor human flesh and went out and picked up children as if he were selectingvegetables at a greengrocer’s stand. He slaughtered them, dressed them intoselect cuts and cooked them up in accordance with his favorite recipes. Nothingtoo fancy…a basic cutlet sautéed with onions. I’d expect the Africans wouldserve up a spicy repast. Bokassa favored a young girl, prepubescent ifavailable.image [Images/193b.jpg]Fish was caught dicing up little Grace Budd, also a prepubescent girl, so itdoes seem that the preference is not necessarily cultural. Maybe the older onesare tough. Pullets and hens are both chicken, but I’d prefer a pullet…moretender and juicy than a stewing hen. Apparently cannibals see things in asimilar light.Human flesh was Fish’s meal of choice, and the motive for the murders hecommitted was called cannibalism. In New York, such an act is regarded asdeviant but not insane, and is socially unacceptable.Compare the Ed Gein case. Gein murdered women and ate them. He also dug up freshfemale corpses and ate them. Dressed them out like deer into appropriate chopsand steaks and roasts, and put them into the meat locker. Gein was regarded asinsane and after he was caught, spent the rest of his life in an insane asylumin Wisconsin.These two cases are very similar, yet in one state the murderer/cannibal wasexecuted, and in the other he was hospitalized as insane. Both cases involvefellows who simply enjoyed a dish commonly unavailable in our society.Then there’s another well-cited case, that of a butcher shop owner who murderedprostitutes and turned them into fine sausage and sold the meat to customers. Hehad a fascinating operation, and sold tons of human sausage. Made a lot ofmoney. As I recall, he was busted because his product was noticeably superiorand the local authorities decided to inspect his premises—a sanitation check.They found several women in cages awaiting slaughter and the story came out.This fellow was also executed. However, I don’t cite this case as ghoulism orcannibalism, but rather murder for profit.Does it make me ghoulish to wonder about the reasons behind a crime? Even if itdoes, being ghoulish isn’t criminal, or even dangerous.The moral of this story is, if you’re going to call me ghoulish, you’d better beable to back it up. I haven’t been charged in a court of law with eating acorpse or robbing a corpse or screwing a corpse, and nobody has found anythingon me that came off a corpse.So tell me, why am I being called a ghoul?image [Images/194.jpg]JESSE IN FLAMESimage [Images/195.jpg]State killings are a spectator sport in Florida. Tickets to these events arealways much in demand, and the atmosphere is surprisingly festive. There is asense of expectation as if fascinating secrets are about to be revealed.The electrocution of cop-killer Jesse Tafero at the Florida State Prison on May4, 1990 promised to be no exception. Political dignitaries from the Capitol wereon hand; representatives from police agencies pushed and shoved as they angledfor the most favorable viewing positions behind the thick glass windows thatallowed an unimpeded view of the death drama.Jesse Tafero was a vicious criminal in his day. He topped off his career inburglary, robbery and rape with the murder of two fine police officers. Therewere some doubts about who actually pulled the trigger on the lawmen. Jesseclaimed it was his rat partner Walter Rhodes and his hooker companion, SoniaJacobs. After all, Rhodes pleaded guilty to the murders and became a witness forthe State. Rhodes’ testimony guaranteed both Sonia and Jesse one-way trips tothe Death House. I remember the day Jesse Tafero came to Florida State Prison. The first thing hedid was scream for someone from the law library; I was a law clerk. OfficerCampbell, the librarian, sauntered over to my desk and said, “The cop-killerTafero wants to see a law clerk. I’m assigning you to handle it.” Campbelllaughed and turned away, amused by his own sense of irony. There was no way Icould refuse the order. Life had thrown me another curve, so I picked up mylegal pad and left the library.I walked down the polished corridor that led to the death cells…the infamous“last mile” walked by men and women fated to die sizzling on the death chair.I’ve walked it year after year, never failing to thank God that at theconclusion of my visits to the condemned that I could turn my back on the grimportals of the death house and walk back to my job in the law library. But onthe day I was scheduled to meet Tafero, my feelings were in turmoil. He had areputation for violence.A tobacco-chewing guard escorted me into R-wing and opened the security gatethat gave me access to the death house cell blocks. As he opened the iron gateshe laughed and said, “If you have any trouble, give me a call and I’ll have thegoon squad come pick up the pieces.”The man had good reason to be amused. He was putting me into an area withseventeen condemned killers, men facing certain death at the hands of prisoncops. Me, an ex-police officer, now an inmate; facing the collective wrath ofmen adjudicated savage beyond redemption.I sucked in my breath and entered the cellblock and walked to Tafero’s privatecell. I stood in front of his bars and said, “I’m Jerry Schaefer, the law clerkassigned to help you.”Tafero took one look at me, picked up his television set and slammed it into theconcrete wall. I stood there as the TV exploded into a thousand bits and made nocomment. “I know you!” He screamed, “You’re that ex-cop who killed 34 women!Aren’t you!?”“That’s what the prosecutor says,” I deadpanned.Tafero cocked his head at me and howled, “But I’m in here for killing cops!”“You killed two lousy cops. I’ve got thirty-four kills. You’ve got a littlecatching up to do, don’t you?”Jesse began beating his fists against the walls and yelling, “I don’t fuckingbelieve this!” Three hours later we were on a first-name basis and he was showing mephotographs of his bimbo, Sonia. She was fine, and I told him so. I didn’tmention that the guards were already talking about what fun it would be to watchthem both fry. It was their fondest fantasy: the double execution of the pair ofcop-killing lovebirds. John Spenkelink had yet to make his historical debut onthe Chair, but for the prison guards at FSP the frying of Tafero and his whorewas something to live for, to speculate upon, day after empty day.The death house guard who let me off the row said with a sense of awe, “I don’tknow why you ain’t dead, boy.”“Jesus loves me,” I told him, and it wasn’t a joke. One of the most powerful inmates in any prison is the skilled legal clerk, andbefore the public funding of lawyers for death row inmates, “jailhouse lawyers”literally held the power of life and death over men whose death warrants hadbeen signed by the Governor. Thousands of executions have been blocked by atimely filing of a petition for the writ of habeas corpus to a United Statesjudge. The key to saving the lives of the condemned is legal knowledge andarticulate representation of constitutional issues.I learned this skill as though my very life depended upon it, which in fact itdid. Within one week of entering FSP, I was under the tutelage of an imprisonedunion boss and labor racketeer who needed my literary skills to draft hismotions to the U.S. District Court in Jacksonville. During the next four yearsof my imprisonment, I studied law during every spare moment and by 1977, I wasregarded as one of the foremost legal minds at Florida State Prison.I was sought out by some of the most virulent criminals in the State, andlearned prison lawyering from ex-judge Joe Peel, who was serving a life sentencefor his part in the double murder of Palm Beach County Judge C.H. Chillingsworthand his wife. Jesse Tafero was damned lucky to have me assigned to help himresearch his legal issues, but as I told him after reading his trialtranscripts, it would only be a matter of time before he’d ride the lightning. Jesse Tafero was a professional criminal with almost limitless unsavoryconnections in the prison system. He spoke well of me to his associates, tellingthem of my research efforts on his behalf and my unquestionable integrityconcerning confidential matters. His esteem for me as an adherent to the ConvictCode of Silence was so strong that I was the person he chose to deliver thedeath message to his former partner, Walter Rhodes, late in 1979.I will not reveal what that precise message was, but it was the driving forcebehind Rhodes rescinding his trial testimony and swearing he’d earlier committedperjury, a tactic that delayed Tafero’s execution for almost six years.I sat down with Walter Rhodes and coached him about what to say. I opened lawbooks and showed him that the rescinding of his testimony would not change theoutcome of the case, only delay it a few years. Rhodes was slated for a prisonrat’s death. His execution contract was given to one of the most feared prisongangs of the eighties. Rhodes was reduced to quaking jelly, knowing full well ofTafero’s ability to reach out from death row and be the instrument of his doom.Rhodes called the Broward County State’s Attorney’s office pleading forprotection. I was standing beside him when he made the call. The policeestablishment had everything they wanted from Walter Rhodes in the way oftestimony. They told him that they could give him no special protection; theyimplied that he was being thrown to the prison wolves, and Walter Rhodes livedin deadly fear for his life. I watched that fear eat away at him.Such is the power of prison crime syndicates, and the indifference of the policeto informants, once the snitch has been milked for everything of use to them. I met with Tafero again in late 1989. He looked good, healthy and handsome,bedecked in gold jewelry and chains. He saw me and smiled like a Mafia Donbestowing a favor on an underling. We spoke of serious matters, of life anddeath. I suggested he turn to Jesus, but he told me he was relying on BruceRogow, a respected constitutional lawyer from Ft. Lauderdale.Tafero ran down the issues that were being considered before the Eleventh USCircuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. I told him he was riding a loser, that thedecision would go against him, and that he’d be dead meat in 1990.“I’ll never quit filing petitions,” he smiled.Tafero was good to his word. On Monday, April 30, 1990 the law clerks spent anentire day helping Jesse file his last-ditch appeals. He’d fired his lawyers andreturned to the inmate law clerks. But for Tafero it was too late…two lawmen hadbeen riddled with gunfire and left in a lake of blood on the roadside.Somebody was going to pay for that.On Friday morning, May 4, 1990 the Warden ordered a full prison lockdown inanticipation of general rioting as a prelude to the Tafero execution. No chancewould be taken that a revolt might disrupt the course of Justice.From my cell window, I looked across the fields of spring wildflowers toward theState highway. Beyond the road I saw the media vans, and fleets of police carbubble lights blinking festively in the early morning. The crowds of morbidcuriosity-seekers and anti-death penalty demonstrators milled in adjacentpastures. I stood at my window and took it all in, measuring the emotional toneof the event.Bundy drew a larger crowd but the pulsing emanations of hate flowing from themob were no less intense. There was no attitude of even-handedness to beapplied, only an amorphous surge of unrestrained violence and projected enmitythat flowed from the crowd toward the prison and those within its walls.Less than fifty yards away from my cell Jesse Tafero, devoid of smiles and goldchains, was showered, shaved and diapered, and led to Old Sparky. It was 7:00a.m.Within five minutes Tafero was strapped to the oaken seat and at a nod from theWarden, the Executioner threw the switch, and fire leapt up from Jesse’s head asif Satan himself had come to claim him. The Warden let Jesse burn alive forthirty seconds before ordering the electrician to cut the flow of current.Officials tinkered with the mechanism of death while Tafero writhed in agony onthe Chair, and smoke from his charred flesh drifted toward the ceiling. A fewminutes later the Warden gave it another try. Once again, flames burst forth asTafero’s flesh ignited and was consumed.The Warden stopped the execution once more, leaving Jesse to squirm in desperatepain. The electrician continued to fiddle with the wires and electrodes. At tenminutes past seven the Warden, seeing that Tafero was obviously still very muchalive, ordered the switch thrown for the third time.Five minutes later Tafero was pronounced dead by the prison doctor. It had takenthe State of Florida almost ten minutes to kill the man.I observed the laughter, the self-satisfied smirks of the prison guards whoregarding the burning alive of a fellow human being as great sport, anentertainment akin to hog butchering. They clearly relished the idea of thecop-killer stripped of his gold and his dignity, writhing against the deathstraps with flames curling up around the metal skullcap.I returned to my cell early that day, reflecting on the Jesse Tafero I hadknown: a man of many passions, not all bad—and not as evil as many who wouldlive a long life. I was there when he walked through the front door, and I wasthere when his roasted corpse went through the back gate in a hearse. For Jesseit was over, but for others it was just beginning.I sat down on my bunk, opened the bound trial transcript of another condemnedman, and began to read—searching for the legal challenge that could save hislife.GREEN DRAGON TONGThe life of a master criminal is fraught with danger and uncertainty.And we were engaged in some unusually risky business. So when the parcel from myniece arrived I couldn’t be completely sure it didn’t contain a bomb, yet Icouldn’t ignore the insistent squawk of my door buzzer. A decision had to bemade.I removed the stolen Model 1911 Army Colt .45 semi-automatic pistol from theleather shoulder holster and held it down next to my leg, slightly behind myback. Then I called out in a gruff voice seeking the true identity of theunknown person lurking on the other side of the plywood door. It could have beenanyone, but it turned out to be a fat black woman delivering mail for the UnitedStates Postal Service.The postal person pushed the carton through the open door with her large foot. Ilooked down upon it, observing the colorful Malaysian stamps franked in thecapital city of Kuala Lumpur. I didn’t know exactly what was inside the sealedpackage, but I had an idea. Hopefully, it was a shipment of the finest refinedhashish produced in the Burmese People’s Republic and trans-shipped over junglytrails to a destination within the Sultanate of Penang, a political unit withinthe Federated States of Malaysia.The Customs police in Asia and, apparently, their counterparts within the UnitedStates seemed to have no interest in opening for inspection a carton marked“Human Remains.”Only a few days earlier I had received an airmailed letter from my nieceMelanie, advising me that my father had died of a stroke while patronizing asing-song girl establishment on Victoria Street, and that his cremated remainswould be airmailed back to the States for interment forthwith. Now here theywere before me on the living room rug, and the uniformed person was demanding mysignature on the postal registration slip. Was it a postal police trap thatwould earn me fifteen years in a federal slammer or was it my ticket toprosperity?I eyed the negress. She smelled of sweat and fried mullet. Was it part of aclever disguise or was it her usual condition of odorous dishevelment? There wasonly one sure way to find out.I signed the green registration card and watched the smelly mailwoman turn onher heel and waddle away on her appointed rounds.Setting the parcel on a coffee table, I withdrew a knife from my boot andcarefully cut away the sealing tape, then I slit open the heavy cardboardpacking case and pulled back the paper lid. Tucked inside, taped under thecardboard flap, was a handwritten note from Melanie, stating that the contentsof the weighty ceramic funeral urn contained the earthly remains of my dearlydeparted daddy. The top of the urn was sealed with a plug of jade green wax,inscribed with an array of Chinese characters and a small fierce-looking dragon.The urn was carefully nestled in a protective cocoon of thick Styrofoam toprotect against rough handling and breakage.Wasting no time in getting to work on the wax seal, I quickly dislodged it withthe point of my black switchblade knife. What I found within the confines of theurn made my heart skip a beat. No familiar odor of pure gummy hashish assailedmy nostrils. What I found was a container of pure brown heroin! My mind raced.What was that crazy bitch Melanie up to now? I could sell the shit for millionswith one quick call. Could it be that my sister’s opportunistic girl had made abig-time connection? And if that was the case, why hadn’t she tipped me off toit? A mystery!Suddenly the door buzzer began its annoying rasping again. Now what? I carefullyopened the door just a crack, keeping one hand on the pistol just to be on thesafe side. I took a quick look. A tall blonde with a pair of knockers likehoneydew melons and a single braid of thick, gleaming hair stood in the hallway.Her emerald eyes were deep-set and sparkling with unconcealed fear. I’d seenthat look enough to know it well.She turned her eyes to me and asked, “Are you Melanie’s uncle?” I gave her analmost imperceptible nod, thinking she sure didn’t look like any cop I’d everlaid eyes on. Then she squeaked, “Help me! Please! They’re after me!”She was the sort of earthy woman that any red-blooded male would be afterconstantly, so the idea that she was being pursued seemed reasonable.“Who’s after you?” I inquired, “Cops?”She pulled a wry face. “No, a hit team sent by the Green Dragon Tong. They’reright behind me! They’ve been on my trail all the way from Kuala Lumpur. You’vegot to save me—I’m Melanie’s best friend!”Almost immediately I heard the tread of footsteps echoing in the stairwell fromthe end of the hall. What was this craziness about the Green Dragon Tong? I knewthey were the criminal gang that controlled the dope trade in Hong Kong, butwhat did that have to do with her?Suddenly the door to the stairs flew open and there they were, a pair ofOrientals at the end of the corridor—a stocky man and a slender woman. The womanyelled, “There she is! Kill her!”And then in slow motion, as if in a dream, I watched the man raise a pistol witha bulbous silencer attached to the muzzle. With a small puff of sound, a bullethole appeared in the wall next to the blonde’s head. That was enough for me. Iyanked the girl into my apartment and closed the door, but I could hear thepatter of shoe leather rapidly approaching. Suddenly a jagged line of bulletholes splintered the wood of the apartment door, shattering furniture andsmashing glass throughout the entire living room. I snatched up the urn full ofprimo dope and pushed the terrified blonde toward the bedroom.“That guy has a silenced Uzi!” the girl whispered with a quaver of true terrorin her voice.“No shit! Now get out the window and down the fire escape! Don’t even thinkabout anything else, it’s way past time to be hauling ass!” I heard the soundsof someone kicking down my front door as I levered myself out the window ontothe metal platform of the fire escape. I tucked the .45 in my belt and the urnunder my arm, and scooted down the stairs after the blonde. The deadly whine ofa ricocheting 9mm slug hurried us on our way.Garbage cans clattered as the mysterious blonde and I leaped from the fireescape ladder and barreled down the filthy alley toward the busy street. Thegirl had a rental car parked nearby. We piled into it, she fired it up and wesped away. I fished a pack of Marlboros out of my jeans and fired one up.“Christ, that was close! Who are those maniacs? And who the hell are you?”The blonde cut her eyes toward me for a second and then returned them to thetraffic. All we’d need now would be a fender bender with yours truly sitting upfront with a stolen pistol and a ceramic pot full of class-A narcotics. Theblonde said, “I’m Helga Sorensen, Melanie’s best friend. Surely she’s mentionedmy name to you?” I couldn’t recall Mel mentioning any Helga, so I just shook myhead in silent perplexity. The blonde continued, “I bring you bad news. Melanieis dead.”That stopped me. All I could manage to say was, “What…what happened?”Helga gave a world-weary sigh. It was a raid by the Kuala Lumpur police. Thespecial anti-narcotics unit. Something like your SWAT teams. There was a hugegun battle. The cops blew her right out of her Reeboks. Gunned her down in thestreet like a dog. Melanie and four other European women. It was a massacre. I’msurprised it didn’t make headlines over here.”“What—dope? The cops seize it by the ton these days. A gunfight in Malaysiaisn’t going to make the news back here.” I took a long drag on the cig and gazedout the window vacantly. “That crazy Melanie. She should have surrendered.”Helga hawked and spat out the window—an amazingly vulgar gesture, I thought. Shealmost growled, “Surrender for what? She’d have a speedy trial and an evenspeedier appointment with a Malaysian hangman. Melanie would rather go outshooting, fighting for her life, than strangling at the end of a rope.”“Hell, we could have bought her out of it! The Cartel would never let Melanieswing—never! She wasn’t some ignorant little bimbo with a couple of ouncesstuffed up her snatch. Melanie was their top woman in Southern Asia. It justdon’t make sense…Mel getting herself in a lousy gunfight. We could’ve arranged anice payday for that judge. Convict her, fine. Reverse it on appeal and deporther ass after the heat mellows out. Happens every day.”The blonde frowned. “Maybe it used to be that way, but those days are long gonein Malaysia. Singapore too. Listen. In Penang it’s the Sultan himself whocontrols the narcotics trade, and anyone caught messing around in it is promptlytried and hanged at Pudu Prison. They hang you for possession in Malaysia. It’sno joke, Mister. Where you been? The Sultans of the Federated States arecleaning up their own drug problems. Now they’re regulating—and I mean strictlyregulating—narcotic exports. What do they care if Australia is in a heroinstupor? It’s business, babe! Big business!”She wasn’t telling me anything new. Dope had always been big money. Melanie wasin middle management, with her home office right in beautiful downtown Bogota.She’d gotten her start as a courier; spent six years faithfully muling coke andheroin packed in her intimate cavities. Never a bust. Not even a close call.Three years alone on the Bogota-to-Paris run. She was a pro, not the type tofuck up and get wasted in a gun duel with police or government stooges anywhere.“It can’t be that rough, Helga. Money talks. Given the choice, would the Sultanrather have a nice hefty bag of Gold Pandas or Melanie’s ass on a rope? He’s arational businessman. He’d go for the gold.”Helga shook her head. She was wending her way through heavy traffic and keepingher eye on the rearview mirror. “Courier work is getting too risky these days,Mister. Smart women aren’t going into that line of work any more. What stone foxfrom North America or Europe is gonna risk her neck for a lousy ten thousanddollar courier fee? I’ll tell you. Very few. It’s an unacceptable risk.”Yet the dope had to move. “Tell me, Bright-Eyes, who mules it today? Somebody’sgot to be out there.”Helga turned left and headed west across the city. She seemed to know where shewas going. “In Southern Asia, it’s all controlled by the Tongs. They use bargirls, diseased prostitutes from the slums. Women so desperate they’ll doanything to get ahead of their poverty. Eighty percent of the women hanged atPudu Prison are Chinese. The police can’t get them all, but the Tongs guaranteethem 10% of every run. Ten out of each hundred couriers that make the HongKong-to-Kuala Lumpur run are betrayed by the Tong.”“You mean to tell me those Chinks are ratting on their own people?”The blonde eyed me and nodded. “You got it. That’s exactly what they do! Theyconsider it the cost of doing business. Overhead. That ten percent is tried andhanged. Makes the police statistics look good, and gives Malaysia aninternational rep for death on drugs, but it’s all a fraud.”“Except for that ten percent. No fraud there!”“True. Those ladies are dead meat—just like you and I are gonna be if those twohitters from the Green Dragon catch up with us…and they probably aren’t farbehind!”I pitched my butt out the window and lit up another one. “Yeah, about thoseGreen Dragon people. What seems to be their problem? Somebody needs to tell themthis area is sectioned out between the Bogota and Medellin Cartels. We don’thave no beef with Chinks from Green Dragon or any other dragon.”Helga inhaled deeply, and released her breath slowly as if she were about todeliver some crucial message. “Heroin—that’s their problem, my friend. Melanieand I pulled a little switcheroo, and unless I miss my guess, the proof of thecaper is right there in your lap…and since the pigs wasted Mellie, I guess hershare goes to you. There’s 10 kilos of pure uncut brown heroin in that pot, andit’s a 50% share. That ought to put you in the millions, but the immediateproblem is how to keep it. Are you man enough to hang onto it?” She cut her eyestoward mine and I nodded. “I’m betting my life you are.”I understood the dilemma perfectly. Melanie was stone cold dead and Helga was onthe run with a quinella of professional killers in pursuit. It was certainlyshaping up to be an interesting day.Helga had herself a fancy flat on the west side of town. The address wasn’tparticularly posh, but the chick impressed me with the key to the penthousesuite. Helga claimed to be Melanie’s best gal pal, but for the life of me, Icouldn’t recollect her mentioning this Swedish delight…nor had Melanie ever beeninclined toward any rip-off actions. Seemed out of character to me, and for allI knew Mel might pull up in the next taxi, or maybe she was really dead in ahole in Penang. But the current problem would still be to stay alive.Helga double-locked the front door. We were twenty stories up, so I didn’t mindwhen she opened the sliding glass doors that led out onto a sun deck andterrace. The place seemed to have it all, including a giant rubber tree thatgrew to the apex of the cathedral ceiling. A selection of pricey modern artgraced the walls. Helga seemed to be laundering her cash through real estate andart.“Let me take your jacket and box of goodies,” Helga said. I shucked mywind-breaker and handed over the urn that had everyone going crazy, and watchedas she stowed the stuff in a closet. The blonde drifted off into the kitchen andreturned with a pair of cold Pepsis. She said, “I could offer you somethingstronger, but I suspect you want to keep your wits about you. Am I right?”I agreed. Snapped open the top on the Pepsi and helped myself to a long colddraught. Helga followed my lead and opened her can, and sipped daintily at thecold drink. “I really like you,” she purred. She gave me the once-over withthose green eyes that glittered like a set of precious gemstones in her finelychiseled face. She arched her back in such a way that her teats threatened toburst through the fabric of the cotton Six Flags T-shirt she was wearing. Thebig Swede was hauling around a nice set of jugs, they were enough to take mymind off my troubles for a moment or two…but not too long, because I was lookingat Big Trouble with a capital B.Then suddenly with no forewarning, Helga was on her knees before me fumbling atmy crotch with singular determination. She yanked down my zipper and took mycock in her well-manicured hand. Her green eyes brightened with feminine lust,as she savored my quickly elongating erection. She was obviously no stranger tohard cock, and stared at it with an undisguised hunger.Helga moaned with contentment as she slipped her spittle-wet lips around theswollen head of my penis and began to nibble her way down the shaft, licking herway toward my balls. She hummed with her exertions and the overheated muskyscent of her wafted upwards to my nostrils. She smelled hot and sexy.When she had my boner up and twitching to the manipulations of her tongue, shereleased it from her mouth with a wet, slurpy pop. She giggled girlishly and ina single graceful movement drew her Six Flags over her head and tossed it ontothe coffee table, revealing her glorious breasts—the pink nipples standing atattention with erotic excitement. She unfastened her skintight designer jeansand slid them off her backside, along with a whispery bikini panty. She waswonderfully naked, and reclined on a large velveteen sofa like some modern nakedMaja waiting to be serviced.She cocked an eyebrow my way in unspoken invitation. The big juicy bitchwouldn’t need to ask twice; I try not to keep girls like that waiting. I shuckedmy own duds and climbed into the saddle. I stuffed my boner into her box and gotto work stroking her hole until the clawing filly reared back and whinnied witha hip-grinding orgasm.I’d been so involved in the monkey business that I had failed to realize thatHelga and I had an audience. The Oriental couple were standing nearbyinscrutably observing the impromptu sex show. The front door was stilldouble-locked, and I wondered how the little creeps got into the living room.What did they do, fly in from the sundeck?When I looked at him, the chunky Chinese gentleman said softly, “Don’t make anysudden moves!” The silenced Uzi cradled in the crook of his arm made thestatement more than a request.Helga began to shake and sob, and drew me fiercely to her bosom, as if my bodycould shield her from the spray of red-hot slugs that she seemed to beexpecting. She wasn’t faking it, she was peeing all over the couch!I looked down at her in wonder and disgust. She closed her eyes and began tognaw on her bottom lip. It looked like she might bite a hole in herself.“Where’s the heroin?” asked the slender but unusually well-stacked Chinese ladystanding beside the chilling visage of the hired Green Dragon Tong killer. Shehad long, thick hair the color of the bottom of a coal mine at midnight, hangingstraight to her shoulders. Her eyes were the color of wet anthracite, deadly andpromising no mercy. The eyes of an unusually cold killer. The overall effect wasenhanced by the curious black silk pajama suit she wore.Embroidered over the breast on the left side was a Green Dragon, the totem ofher secret criminal society. The talons of her Dragon were capable of reachinghalfway around the world.When I didn’t answer, the Chink bitch glared at me and spat, “You give usheroin! You give it now! You not give, you die plenny quick!”I was in no mood to die plenny quick or even a little bit at a time. I lookeddown at the shaking Helga and said reasonably for all to hear, “Hey, do you knowwhat these two characters from Central Casting are babbling on about?” The nakedwoman beneath me whined piteously and shook her head back and forth in abjectdenial. What could I do, call her a liar? I was in no position to argue.“My lady friend here don’t know nothing about no heroin. Now why don’t youburglars haul ass on out of here right now and we won’t even call the law aboutthis home invasion outrage. Don’t they teach you manners where you come from?”What the hell, if they’re fixing to blow us away, might as well fish for time,and maybe get an unexpected opening to settle their hash before they settlemine.The stocky Chinaman laughed heartily, but I noticed his little lotus blossom ofa partner didn’t crack a smile. “Do not be fooled by this common prostitute,Sir! That one knows very well why we are here, for she is a thief. We have cometo retrieve for our Master that which belongs to our Tong. What we seek issomewhere in this apartment. Our property was shipped to you in the name of yourdead niece. You speak to me of manners! Frankly, we are quite astonished thatyou now consort with the very woman responsible for her sad and unnecessarydeath.”I felt a ripple of involuntary terror course through the lovely body beneath me;then the big blonde began to shiver in earnest. I looked at the Chinaman withsincere interest all over my mug. “That’s one hell of a yarn. Why don’t youexplain to me what’s going on here, before you get carried away with that ‘dieplenny quick’ shit?”The Chink spoke as reasonably as a banker’s lawyer evicting a widow and sevenstarving kids from their home.“The shameless harlot is a confidential informant for INTERPOL. She befriendedyour niece Melanie in Kuala Lumpur, then betrayed her to the Penang police formoney. She led the police to your niece and was present when she and herassociates were taken captive. It was on the suggestion of this Helga, who isnow beneath you, that the North American and European women were summarily shot.Now the same woman who was the betrayer of your own flesh and blood befriendsyou also. She is a very friendly woman, is she not? I believe her intention isto have you arrested…or perhaps even murdered by the lawless police of the DEA.You are very well known to the DEA, are you not? It would pay well if you wereable to be, how do you phrase it? Put out of circulation?”Could it be that I’d been a chump for a pretty piece of tail once again? TheChink wasn’t lying. His voice carried an underlying tone of righteous anger, asif he were a victim of the lousy cops himself. I looked down at the nowwide-eyed Helga. “What do you have to say about all that, lady?”She didn’t say a word. She immediately dissolved into a series of mindless sobsand hiccups. I slowly climbed off the Judas bitch feeling dirty and full ofunspoken rage. The Chinaman had me covered with the Uzi. I leaned over the whoreand hissed, “What about it, cunt! Is he telling the truth? Or not?”The naked informant sat up on the urine-soaked sofa and nodded with hopelessresignation, admitting her guilt. She tossed her braid back over her shoulderand said defiantly, “You’re nothing but dope-pushing scum. You and those twolittle niggers. You’re committing crimes against humanity. There’s a war ondrugs and you’re the enemy. You deserve to die!”I listened thoughtfully to her tirade. When she was finished I asked theChinaman, “What are you planning to do?”The little black-eyed lotus blossom piped up, “Do you know where our heroin is?”I admitted that I did.The Chinaman swung the Uzi toward Helga and fired a quick burst into her chestdirectly between those lovely rubbery boobs. The blast of 9mm lead blew afist-sized hole in her back, along with a spray of shredded flesh, blood and awhite hunk of her spine.She bounced off the back of the sofa and flopped forward face down on the shagcarpet. She had not uttered a sound or asked to be spared. She knew when hernumber was up. A scarlet pool began to form around her. Her tapered fingersopened and closed; her legs jerked and twitched with little spastic movements.Then the Chinese woman turned her hefty Baretta 9mm semi-automatic pistol towardme and said in a no-nonsense tone, “We require the heroin at this time. You willgive it to us now.”“Whoa! And what happens when I cooperate? Does Charlie Chan here blow me awaythe same way he just aced the pretty cop?”The Chinaman spoke right up. “The Green Dragon Tong has no evil intentionstoward you, sir. You are another victim of the wicked betrayer. You heard thewords from her own mouth. There is a war being fought. The governments wouldempty the rice bowls of our starving children. We are business people. Honestcapitalists who just supply the demands of our customers. We only wish toprotect our investments and live in peace. You will suffer no harm from theGreen Dragon Tong. However, should you wish to dishonor us by attempting tosteal that which belongs to our people then my lovely associate will have togive you a lesson you would not welcome. The choice is yours, of course. We arecivilized people, are we not?”The Chink was a genial son of a bitch. I wasn’t really interested inexperiencing any artfully applied Chinese tortures. There was no choice but togive the suckers what they wanted and hope they’d be good to their word. Hey, Iwas a victim! Hadn’t they told me so themselves?“Yeah, look, man, your dope is right there in the front closet. As soon as I sawthe little green seal I was afraid someone had fucked up. I was expecting somehash actually…for personal consumption of course.”“But of course!” The Chinaman nodded somberly, then hustled off to check out mystory. The little lady smiled maliciously as she pointed her Baretta autoloaderat my still-wet dick and said in a conversational manner, “If you lie to us,then I shoot that thing off you plenny quick. I make bang-bang and then you nomore number-one stud, eh?”Eh, indeed! I wasn’t about to tell that pair any cute stories. I’d put on akimono and serve them green tea and fortune cookies or call out for hot chopsuey for plenny-quick delivery, all they’d have to do is ask. I took my cock inmy hand. “Nice looking Suzie Wong like yourself might like to take a ride onthis here magic dragon some time. Think so?”She smiled mischievously and said, “Oh! Very yes!” But she didn’t drop herdeadly aim from my nuts.“Mind if I put my pants on now?”She frowned. A big decision. “Is OK. I never mind.”She watched with undisguised feminine interest as I jacked my ass into my jeans.Whoever spread the story that ladies don’t like to look was a damned liar. Shewas looking for all she was worth.“Too big for a little delicate Chinee girl like yourself, doncha think?”She muttered something in Cantonese that probably meant something like “go fuckyour mother,” and suppressed a wry grin. Then her partner called to her in thesame dialect and she turned on her heels and ran to him. I had no inclination toreach for my gun.The Chink unlocked the penthouse door and turned and gave me a small bow. Hisdoxy made a feline sound and bequeathed me with a smoldering look. Another time,another place, that one would be a handful.They politely closed the door, and left me to contemplate my fate and clean upthe mess the whore had made of herself.GATOR BAITThe locals called the place Johnny’s Bass Hole, but the big attraction was notthe bass. It was the monster alligators that could be seen sunning themselves onthe spoil bank across the canal from the little boat dock.People came to Johnny’s for bait, tackle and cold drinks. There was a fishcleaning table right next to the dock. Fishermen would clean their catch outbehind Johnny’s and fling the guts into the water and the gators would comescrambling. The regular anglers who’d clean their catch at Johnny’s would callup the gators from the cattails by tapping the handle of a fish-skinning knifeon the boards of the table.Go out there and make that tap-tap-tap noise, and you could rouse a couple offourteen-footers along with the old 16-foot bull gator they called CaptainCrunch. He was particularly fond of the unwanted kittens and puppies peoplewould carry out to Johnny’s. They’d fling them into the canal and Captain Crunchwould gobble them down.There was a big NO SWIMMING sign by the dock. Yankee tourist kids needed to readthe sign, maybe ask about it. But locals knew better than to go swimming inJohnny’s Bass Hole.The only person ever eaten alive by an alligator in Broward County was taken offa levee within a mile of Johnny’s. Big old monster come up out of the hydrilla,chomped down on that boy’s leg, and drug him off into the canal. The boy, who’dbeen dozing by a cane pole set out for catfish, was chewed into parts andswallowed. His friend had seen it happen and reported it to the sheriff.The sheriff called the Fish and Game Commission and a posse took up the hunt. Byand by, some of the officers put a hook in the gator, dragged him out of thecanal, shot him, cut him open, and there was the boy. In parts, of course, butperfectly identifiable.Pictures were taken of the dead gator and the chomped-up boy and those snapshotswere posted on the walls at Blackie Hinkle’s Bait & Tackle on State Road 84, andnorth of the floodgates on US 27 at Johnny’s Bass Hole. I saw those picturesmany times over the years they were posted. That’s where I got the idea.I figured that if a gator could gobble down a big old boy like that, that awhole passel of gators would have no problem at all with a particularsoft-bellied whore lady who’d dragged me away from my accustomed path ofrighteousness right down into Satan’s Hell.I was an athlete. Kept in shape running, never missed doing a couple miles aday. One day I came to notice this damned woman out in her front yard sunningherself. Remember the song about the itsy bitsy teeny weeny yellow polka dotbikini? Well, the one she had on was akin to that, only smaller, and white. Ilater came to know it was a French make. I read it on the label the night I wasgoing through her bureau drawers, waiting for her to come home so I could killher.I’d go jogging by, and she’d be laid out all greasy with sun tan oil there on aplastic chaise lounge.I did look, and what I saw wasn’t decent. I saw her pussy hair spilling outaround the elastic by her crotch. Imagine her laying there with her legs open,the skimpy fabric pulled up tight so I could see the cunt crack underneath,pubic hair all falling out everywhere. Showing her cunt in public.If she was sitting up reading when I happened by, she’d smile and sometimes leanforward, showing me her titties pouched up on those half-cups.I looked. I did. Sometimes she’d smile and lean forward a bit more, let me seethe nipples. I knew what she was up to: seduction. She was an occasion of sin,and I had to do something about it. I began to keep a close eye on her.On weekdays she’d watch the eleven o’clock news in her living room, then comeinto the bedroom. I’d watch her through the half-open drapes in the bedroomwindows. Her routine rarely varied. She’d undress; a messy woman, she’d leaveher clothes strewn about.Then she’d go into the bathroom and squat on the toilet. There was a metalmagazine holder beside the toilet. She’d do her business while flipping throughthe pages of Cosmopolitan or Vogue.Occasionally she would stare directly at the window as if she sensed mypresence. The toilet face the bedroom window. I watched her for months, keptnotes. I knew her bedtime routine. She’d spend ten minutes on the pot with hermagazines. Then she’d turn off the light, come out into the bedroom, take cleanunderpants from her bureau drawer, step into them, and go to her bed.She never wore a nightgown, she slept naked except for her panties. The bed wasjust to one side of the window. I could smell the whore lying there.I knew where she kept her hide-a-key too. It was under a brick near the frontdoor.She was a party girl, a weekend boozer. She’d come in late on Friday andSaturday nights, leave her date at the front door, and then go through herroutine. I made up my mind to visit her while she was tiddly. I chose a moonlessSaturday night. Watched her leave with her usual boyfriend, let myself in withher hide-a-key, looked around for a good place to wait. I had plenty of time.I went into her bedroom. It was familiar to me. I took in the view of the windowfrom her angle, and noticed that when the bedroom light was on it was notpossible to see outside. I went to her bureau drawer and helped myself to ahandful of nylon stockings. I stuffed them into the pocket of my cutoffs.It was summer and I was wearing nothing but my cutoffs and a leather knifesheath that contained a Rapala Finnish skinning knife. I prefer the narrow bladeof the high-quality Rapala product. Honed to razor sharpness, the knife can beangled in under the ribcage and up into the heart in an instant.I waited in the darkness of an unused bedroom. Just sat there in a chairfingering the knife and wondering if I’d have the nerve to take the whore tovisit Captain Crunch. I had it all worked out in my mind. There was rope andcement blocks in my car. There would be plenty of time to drive her out toJohnny’s and dice her up before the first fishermen came around. She’d be gatorshit on the bottom of the Everglades by Monday morning.The slut came home just past midnight. In the quiet of the house, I heard hersay her nighty-nights to her date and close the door. She went into the fridgefor something, and I heard the clunk of its door shut. I heard her heelsclip-clop on the terrazzo as she made her rounds, checking her doors. I knew shewouldn’t enter the unused bedroom; it wasn’t part of her routine.I saw the light come under the door. She walked past, just on the other side ofthe door from me. I could hear the rustle of her skirts.I fingered the blade of the knife, smiled to myself, and sat perfectly still,hardly daring to breathe. I listened to her undress, visualizing the actions I’dwatched at least a hundred times before. I could hear her urinating in the quietof the house; I waited. I heard the toilet flush after ten minutes. She wasright on schedule. Soon the light would go out.I watched her in my mind’s eye. Heard the bureau drawer open. Fresh panties forthe whore’s ass. There was a rustle of bed linens and the light went out. She’dneed time to settle into sleep. My watch told me it wasn’t even one o’clock. Ihad time to give her. Plenty of time. I decided to wait until half-past one.I walked into her bedroom on silent bare feet, my eyes well adjusted to thedark. The whore was on her back snoring, a rhythmic purr. I stood over hertaking in the dim outline of her nakedness, absorbing her essence. She wassleeping, secure in her own home, safe in her own bed. I smiled in anticipationof her coming surprise, and considered for a moment that it might be easier tosimply put the knife into her while she slept.I decided against it. My preference was to do whores in a standing posture,punch the slender blade in under the left ribcage and angle it up into theheart. Stop the heart and there is very little bleeding. There’s a specialpleasure in watching the eyes as the soul departs. One moment they are alivewith an all-consuming interest. Then, as the knife cleaves into the heart, theybecome suddenly vacant, dull and…lifeless.I had carried a pillow in from the other bedroom. With my left hand I put itover the woman’s face, and with my right hand I put the point of the bladeagainst her throat. I felt the slut come awake.I said in a growl, “Scream and you die. Move and you die.”I pressed the point of the knife into her flesh to underline the threat. Then Isaid, “Close your eyes and roll over on your stomach.” She did so immediately.I set the pillow over her head, pulled her arms behind her and tied her wristswith one of her nylon stockings. I warned her again, “If you open your eyes I’llkill you,” and then I removed the pillow and gagged her with two nylons.I took the pillow out of its linen case and drew the case over the whore’s head,then tied it firmly in place with a stocking. The bitch was secure. I sat downon the bed next to her and said nothing, allowing the fear to build.My heart was racing and my cock was hard. I took in the scent of heralcohol-laced sweat. She opened the game with hitching sobs, the female firstline of defense. I’d seen it before. Crying brings on a runny nose, and beforeyou know it the bitch has snot all over her lower face. The inside of thepillowcase tends to get slick with it. Tears are the harbingers of hysteria.I reached over and jerked her head back with my left hand. With my right I setthe long blade of the knife under the whore’s chin. The acrid stink ofterror-induced sweat rose from her to assault my nostrils.“Silence,” I hissed, and let her head drop back onto the bed. She whimpered andsneezed twice into the pillowcase hood.I was in no hurry. While the minutes dragged by, the whore lay there on herbelly breathing raggedly through her gag and snot-obstructed nostrils. I let theblade of the skinning knife wander down the knobby spine to the elasticwaistband of the white nylon panties. I turned the knife over on its side andlet the scalpel-sharp edge slice through the elastic and part the fabric downthe cleavage of her buttocks.She understood.I set the blade in the cleavage and put a bit of pressure on the inside of thefleshy cheek. First a little pressure to the left, then a little to the right.She silently spread herself for me as a good riding mare responds to the touchof the reins. Whores know what to do.I let my fingers trace the path of the blade. The whore was greasy with sweat.My finger touched her anus; I felt her clench her sphincter. I pushed my fingeragainst the hole; she tightened it even harder. I removed my finger, stood up,leaned over her and spread her buttocks with my left hand. With my right, I setthe point of the blade against the puckered opening. She began to shiver as ifin the throes of a chill. I smelled her wet the sheets.Sat back down on the bed. Shucked off my cutoffs, set my knife on top of them,stood up and masturbated. I came almost instantly, spraying semen over thewoman’s buttocks and back. She twitched and squirmed with alarm as the gobbetsof semen landed on her.I instantly felt an overwhelming sense of guilt. I was still young then, andunacquainted with the parameters of power and rage in the unholy union betweensexual release and death. I pulled on my cutoffs and knew in my heart that Icould not carry through with the plan. Captain Crunch was going to have to wait.I sat down on the woman’s bed again, took another nylon from my pocket and tiedher ankles together, then I stood up and took out my penis and urinated over thewhore’s buttocks and back. She lay on her belly shaking. I stepped to the frontof the bed and urinated on the pillow case over her head. She gurgled andwheezed as the urine soaked her.I leaned over and slid my hand up under the wet pillow case and found herthroat. I could feel the blood pounding beneath my fingers. The room was hot andstinking. The excitement and lust were coursing through me. I drew myself downclose to the whore’s head and spoke close to her ear. I told her, “If you tellanyone what happened here tonight I’ll find out. I’ll come back and slit yourthroat. Do you understand me? If you do, nod your head.”She bobbed her head rapidly against the sheets.“Good. I have a key to your house. I got it from your ex-lover. Better changeyour locks, hear?”Her head bobbed again.My fingers closed around her neck, pressed the rapidly pulsing carotid, closingit. She went limp, the oxygen cut off to her brain. I released my hold on herneck, felt the blood come surging through the vessels under my fingers.I stood up, turned on the light. Found her purse, cleaned out her wallet. Cashonly. A tube of red lipstick caught my eye. I recalled reading about a killer inChicago who wrote messages with his victim’s lipstick on the wall. I opened thetube, brought up the lipstick, and looked at the naked back of the unconsciouswhore.I stepped to her and wrote WHORE across her back. She’d never have the nerve toshow that to the police. I took a last look around, feeling disappointment thatmy plans were in ruins, but then turned out the light and left.The woman was up and about early the next day. I saw her supervising thelocksmith as he changed all of her locks. She had a tasteful scarf around herneck. I never saw a police car at her house, but she had floodlights installedat the corners of her property and kept them on all night. I sometimes wonderedwhich of her former lovers would be the object of her enmity.She continued to sunbathe in her little bikini, but she stayed in the back yard.Now and then she’d look my way as I jogged past on my daily run. I sensed thather passions were subdued.image [Images/211.jpg]FALSE CONFESSIONSimage [Images/212.jpg]First KillIt was the spring of 1962—spring break, as it happens—and I had just turnedsixteen. Had my driver’s license and the use of the family car, a green ‘57 Fordstation wagon.I drove down to Ft. Lauderdale Beach one evening, prowling for beer and pussy.That’s what I told myself. The best I could brag on was what we called “heavypetting” and that wasn’t solving any sexual release problems of the kind we allhave at age sixteen.I parked the wagon at Bahia Mar—it was still free back in those days. I walkedacross the street to the beach parking lot that had been roped off to create adance area. At night, the bands would play and the couples would mingle. It wassupposed to be for the college kids only, but every high school harry in BrowardCounty was hanging out at those beach dances. Spring break was always a wildevent in Ft. Lauderdale.I was there early, well before sundown, and spied myself a lone girl hangingout. She was leaning against a palm tree next to a picnic bench minding her ownbusiness, probably waiting for the dance to crank up same as everyone else. Iwent up to her and said, “Hi.”It was no big deal. I was still a virgin. I had no idea how to put the rightmoves on a girl to let her know I was after sex, so it was all very non-eroticand innocent.This girl was rather ordinary, a bit on the short side but with a nice figureand certainly under 25. She had brown hair and wore a blouse and walking shorts.We had a nice chat, the usual bullshit, and decided to take a walk down thebeach to kill some time.Back in those days south of Bahia Mar there was the Yankee Clipper, and then afairly deserted stretch of beach running all the way to the Port Evergladesjetties. A hike down to the jetties and back was a real nice stroll. So I said,“Let’s walk down to the jetty,” and she was all for it.It was twilight by the time we got down to the ship channel. Not a soul around.All the people were a mile north, where the dance was going to be. On the waydown to the jetty the little bitch was rubbing and pushing her boobs against myarm, sending her make-out signals, so by the time we actually arrived at therocks, there was a certain sexual tension between us. We got down to the jettyand next thing you know, we were making out.No doubt this was a very romantic scene for the girl: the sunset, the handsomeyoung man, the passionate embraces along the lovely secluded beachfront. Shegets her little taste of fantasy: the french kisses, the boob massage, the feelof a hard dick in a man’s pants pressing against her belly. And then suddenlyshe decides she’s had enough. She breaks the embrace and dances away with amerry giggle.She was wearing a silk scarf. You don’t see them much anymore, but in the earlysixties, the girls would wear them to the beach to keep their hair from beingwind-blown. When she turned to bounce away, I grabbed her and caught her scarf.It came away in my hand.She turned around and I flipped the scarf over her head and pulled her back tome. In the same motion I made a knot in the scarf and pulled it tight. Just aquick jerk in a playful manner. You know, flip it over her head and pull herback. A game.But the silk scarf went deep into her soft neck flesh. She opened her eyes wide;it was almost a comical expression. Then her eyes rolled up into her head andshe collapsed like a boneless doll. Her legs twitched for a bit and then she wasstill.I thought she was horsing around. I went right to her and untied the scarf. Thesmell of her made me ejaculate. The smell cannot be described but it triggeredan already powerful horniness into climax. Her shorts were urine-sodden. She hadfallen forward on her face, and when I rolled her over she was soaked, and aslimy drool was all over her mouth and chin. I was shaky and agitated, but I didhave the presence of mind to know that before me was trouble with a capital T.So I stripped down to my jockey shorts and pulled her into the water. There wasonly a gentle swell, and I paddled out the length of the jetty, made a swingaround the east end of the thing, and swam her about thirty yards out into theship channel. The tide was just turning and the current took her seaward. Hershoes and clothing caused her to sink slowly, her arms outflung, her littleclutch purse tucked into her shorts.I swam back around toward the beach, got dressed and walked back to the dance. Ican’t even recall what she said her name was. Maybe Linda, but I can’t swear onit. Nobody stopped me or questioned me or looked at me oddly. I was just anothercollege kid on the beach. Most interesting of all, I wasn’t struck dead by abolt of lightning. But everything had changed.After a while it was as if it had never happened. I did think on that event fora long time. There was an enormous power involved in the thing. I’d beenterribly horny to begin with. The make-out session had held me on the point oforgasm, and then I did ejaculate all over myself. Remember now, this occurredwell before I’d had any genuine normal vaginal sex with a female, so there wassome abnormal imprinting there certainly.What had me amazed was how quickly the little bitch had collapsed. Certainlythat was due to the constricture of her carotid artery. It was completelyinadvertent, but also fascinating, and a very clean kill compared to most.Once I began to take murder seriously I always had to remain aware of clean-up,and since I always hated having to clean up messes, I experimented with ways toavoid making the mess.After that initial kill in 1962 there was, of course, a lot of guilt. I had tomake a conscious decision as to whether I wanted to experiment with a secondgirl. I finally decided that I did, and in order to prepare myself I read everybook and magazine I could find on the topic of crime and murder.Eventually I came to see that if one plans carefully one may kill with minimalrisk. There are basic rules to follow if one is to avoid apprehension.In 1962 and 1963 I concentrated almost exclusively on transient hitch-hikers.One of my favorite hunting grounds was the Jo-Der Truck Stop on State Road 84,just west of US 441. Women would hit the Jo-Der for coffee and then come out onthe parking lot apron to thumb a ride west. It was a 20-mile run to Andy townand I knew every isolated side road over that twenty miles. Believe it.Another early pickup point was the junction of US 27 and SR 84. From theroadside park I could watch for transient women going in any direction—southtoward Miami, east toward Lauderdale, west toward Naples, or north towardClewiston. I would examine the women from a distance with binoculars and make myselection from a quick observation.My usual approach to these hitchhikers would be to make the pickup and start aconversation. Once I’d determined the woman was not a local who’d be missed, I’dproposition her for sex. “Hey, would you like to screw? I’ll give you twentydollars.” About 80% would give a positive response. Most would agree to acceptmoney in exchange for oral sodomy. This suited me, since my interest was inkilling whores, not innocent women who were just down on their luck.The actual sex was always limited to the preliminaries, the kissing and breastfondling. My intention was to get the female “hot” so she would orgasm duringstrangulation. This was a misconception on my part, due to my inexperience.My source material was marriage manual sex books that stressed foreplay. I couldtalk about sex knowledgeably and recognized female orgasm when I saw it, feltit, smelled it. Always the back would arch, the victim would tremble andconvulse, and the eyes would roll back. It’s a most distinctive reaction. Andwhen she’d have her climax, I’d have mine. I never felt guilty about killingthem when I’d paid good money for their services.I’d sometimes experiment with how long the woman could hold her breath. I’d layher on the front seat of the car, her head in my lap, and then I’d clap one handover her mouth and squeeze the nostrils closed with the other hand. I’d take herright to the edge of death and then let her have some air. Then we’d talk aboutit.Death on SexI had killed seven women before I ever had normal sex with a girl. Looking backon it there was a sexual element involved even at the beginning. I found myselferect during the killing, even though I was purposely engaged in murder, and notrape or sexual molestation. The victims were WHORES and the correct thing to dowas to destroy them.These women left somewhere and were never known to arrive at their destination.During this time I always selected single victims. Later for variety I diddouble and triple victims.I discovered very early that the average female on the prowl in a bar or on thestreet was interested in sex in one form or another. The buzzword in the latesixties was “Wanna get high?” Those girls got a high that had nothing to do withdrugs.I rarely had anyone turn me down. I was sixteen or seventeen, and a fine hunkykid. I’d pull off SR-84 at any one of a number of places, and first thing I’d dowould be pull a pistol, and then I’d handcuff the woman so that her wrists werebehind her back. Nobody argues with a pistol. I’d say that most of these womenunderstood instinctively that they were in serious trouble.The killing shed was on private land. The roadway leading to it was arrangedwith light test fishing line. If the line was disturbed, I’d abort the killingto a second area.After the victim’s wrists were handcuffed behind her back, a dyed pillowcase waspulled over her head. The hood was merely to prevent her from seeing thenecessary preparations. A noose was prepared using whatever type rope I wasexperimenting with at the time.I’d toss it over the grooved beam, then remove the victim from the car and takeher into the shed. I’d set the noose, then take up the slack by tying the ropeto the car bumper. Then I’d get into the car and back up. I kept detailed noteson the victim’s reactions.It was all done quickly. Hooding to hanging in perhaps fifteen minutes at most.Those early days were training in the techniques and dynamics of death. Thesexual element was there, but the nastiness was counter-productive to any greatsexual interest. Those early women, suddenly hanged, were considerably lessbefouled than later victims who were permitted to view the noose: a device toheighten their terror and enhance my own sexual excitement.By reading about prison hangings, I learned how hangmen used a rubber beltsimilar to a G-string to inhibit in a modest way the woman’s defecation atexecution. Using the idea of the rubber belt, I’d yank the victim’s panties upinto the crack of the buttocks before pulling her up. This practice kept themess to a minimum, which was my preference at that time.Initially the killings were done by ruse and solely by hanging. The entire scenewas playfully carried out, every young thing being paid to pose as a caperingCattle Kate. The first few that were hanged provided very little visualstimulation. It was something of a disappointment, because I’d read in numeroussources where English hangmen of the eighteenth century could make a femalecondemned dance a lively jig, a frisk or strut in the air. Later hangmen hadfemales kicking like cancan dancers.My Kates were not as thrilling as I’d expected. The best of them looked spastic.They’d shake, quiver and twitch, but there was no satisfying “kick and spin.” Iwas doing something incorrectly. The problem turned out to be the rope. I wasusing a soft quarter-inch braided nylon, identical to the type used at modernexecutions by hanging of females. It was a fine killing loop, intended for usewithout a drop, and designed to close the woman’s major blood vessels in herneck.There were a surprising number of informative sources concerning the fine pointsof execution by hanging. I picked up on the technical aspects reported in thesesource materials from over the course of 500 years. By the end of my career, Iwas skilled enough to kill a whore instantly or keep her alive on the rope foran hour. The killing became an art form, and I became a Master.The Kates would die with a visible final shudder and then go limp. I came torecognize the extinguishment of life and would waste no time moving the carforward so that the victim was suspended only a foot or so off the ground. I’dundress her from top to bottom. First the clothing, then the jewelry.Then I’d take out my penis and after lubricating it with saliva, I’d slide itinto the upper portion of the victim’s buttocks. I’d ejaculate almost instantly.The Kates were dirty down between their legs, but the cleft of the buttocks wasclean, and provided a perfectly suitable substitute so far as I was concerned.I was positive at that time that whores were diseased and any contact with thepussy was potentially lethal. Over the years the sexuality came to the forefrontin the form of sadism, but that was much later.Fascinating ConversationsThere were always interesting new problems. I learned that some women love toscream. A raven-haired Yankee girl who had agreed to suck my dick for twentydollars took one look at the noose and began to shriek her lungs out. I wasreally taken aback by her reaction, because every other woman had groveled andbegged.I didn’t want bloodstains in the car, so I cranked up the ignition and drovestraight to the rockpit, tied the line with cinder block to her ankles, andtossed her in the water. She went down blowing bubbles, her mouth open.Like everything else done routinely, killing whores eventually became boring.Then one day quite by accident I discovered the sexual exhilaration to be hadfrom wrestling an unwilling whore toward the noose.The pudgy blonde Kate had managed to get her head out of the pillow slip hood.She caught it on the rearview mirror and wiggled it up and off her head. She wasa snowbird waitress from Minnesota who was very willing to play at sex with thehunky college boy.I looked up from tying the rope to the bumper and saw her eyes as wide asaucers, looking up at the rope. I went around to her side and opened the door,and she screamed, “What are you doing?!!”I told her very reasonably, “You’re to be hanged for a whore.”She screamed, “You’re crazy!” Then she levered herself away from me, her headagainst the driver’s door, and scissored her feet at me, kicking. I grabbed herankles and yanked her toward me. Her skirt slid up and I saw she had a hole inher underpants. Pubic hair was poking through.I dragged her out of the car, then wrestled her over to the noose and she wassobbing and babbling and saying, “Oh God, please, no! Oh, for the love of God,please don’t hurt me!”The blonde provided a taste of something new and sexually extraordinary for me.I found that I enjoyed the way she begged. I loved the hopeless desperation inher eyes.The eyes of the victims were everything: saucerian beneath a clear plastic bag,bugged out as the rope lifted them from the ground, desolate as the thin bladeslipped into living flesh and angled up into the beating heart…The average female is easy to kill. Every one I attended to personally believedmy primary motivation was sexual. The professional whores were best atunderstanding the nature of their peril. I could say to them, “You are going todie,” and most of them would nod and calmly accept it, at least on the surface.These females gave me my finest challenge because I could always count on atleast one serious escape attempt.The challenge was important to me. The whore was usually interested in themethodology planned for her death. Once I had her secure we were then able tospeak freely. There were some really marvelous discussions. She’d ask, “What areyou going to do to me?”I’d reply, “I’m going to kill you.”She’d say, “No, I mean how are you going to do it?”“It doesn’t matter to me. Do you have a preference?”It was at that point that many of them would start crying. Not all, but many.Then they’d all complain, “But I don’t want to die!”I’d just tell them as nicely as possible, “It’s required that you die.” Andthey’d go, “But why?” and I’d say, “Because you are a whore.” That responsewould put the casual trollop into a panic, but the pros were never confused bymy reasoning.Fascinating conversations were always available, and every woman was different.One mentally acute young hooker upon learning of my interest in killing whoresexplained to me ever so reasonably that she was not a whore but a prostitute,and there was a difference.I listened to her rationalizations with polite interest, slid the foldednewspaper under her bottom, and pushed the seat forward until her knees werejammed under the dashboard. I asked her, “Are you comfortable?”“Yes, I’m OK. Listen, I’m not a whore, really. I’m not. You don’t understand…”As it turned out, “I’m not a whore” were that whore’s last words.The Main RulePerhaps the most basic rule for a successful career in serial murder is that thecorpse must be promptly disposed of. The use of remotely located rockpits solvedthat problem for me. The nude Kate would be wrapped in a plastic shower curtainand driven to the nearby rockpit, removed from the car, rolled out of herplastic shroud and dumped into the water with a cement block tied to her ankles.The entire process took less than one hour.There were three separate rockpits with three separate stolen cars at thebottom. I found this necessary since I worked different areas at various times,and I’d want a disposal pit in close proximity to my execution site. I wouldsearch the clothing and personal property for cash, and then all else went tothe dump, except the identity papers, which were burned.The rockpits were deep and clear. I’d wear my SCUBA tank and meet the Kate atthe bottom, untie the line to the cement block, swim her over to the car and tieher to the hulk. Each one was secured to the front or rear bumper of the sunkencar by separate poly-pro lines at each ankle and a third line tied around thewaist.One problem I initially encountered was a grotesque swelling. The Kate wouldfill with gas and give the appearance of being hugely pregnant. Attached to thefront grillwork of the car by her ankles she’d look like a big balloon. I wasalways very careful to secure the Kates well, so they would not surface or breakfree. Once I began to slit the Kate’s belly, a cut from the top of the pubichairline to the breastbone, gas formation was lessened, due to the fish, crabsand turtles feeding on the viscera.A gut-slit Kate left outside the car would usually be skeletonized within two orthree weeks, depending on the season. Kates placed inside the cars and securedto the steering wheel or left wearing a seat belt took a little longer.Once the Kate was reduced to a pile of bones I would collect them, put them in aburlap bag and swim the bag to another part of the pit for burial underwater. Ahole of a few feet could be scooped out on the sand bottom, the bones put intothe hole and covered over. This disposal was virtually undetectable. On a goodweekend I might take a half-dozen Kates to the rockpits, but sometimes I mightgo several months without hunting.Over the years some of the cars may have been found and hauled out for scrap,but I never left a Kate in a car, so I’m sure the purpose of the vehicles at thebottom of the rockpits was never understood, just written off as stolen cars.BLONDE ON A STICKA full moon was kissing the eastern horizon the evening I saw them standingbeneath the winking neon marquee of a Tastee Freeze with their thumbs waving atthe sparse traffic.I pulled over; they piled in, grinning and giggling. Townie trash heading forthe bright lights of Orlando, the Happy Trails Dance Hall, and a night of funonly twenty miles down the two-lane blacktop. Forty-five minutes later they werebound, gagged and tucked away in my trunk, facing an uncertain future as theylistened to the hum of rubber on concrete…well, at least one of them was.The capture had been an exercise in simplicity. The first deserted stretch ofhighway found me pulling off the road onto the shoulder. I put the heap inneutral and pulled the gun. A snub-nosed black belly. I pointed it between theteats of the sassy brunette riding shotgun beside me: delighted at the shiver offear that took her, the involuntary widening of the mascaraed shiny brown eyes.She froze like a doe caught in a poacher’s jacklight. The blonde in the backseat squeaked out a question: “What are you doing?”“It’s a stick-up,” I said, “You cooperate, you live. You give me any trouble,I’ll stick this gun down your throat and pull the trigger. Now hand over yourpurse.”The blonde couldn’t hand over the purse fast enough. It came sailing right overthe seat. She leaned back and licked her lips and sighed.“Now turn around and put your hands behind your back.”She did as she was told. I silently admired the lovely heart-shaped rump she’dpacked into her designer jeans like so much sausage in a skin; I reached overthe seat and snapped a pair of steel wristcuffs on her. Heard the sharp intakeof her breath. I felt her eyes on me and gauged her rising panic.“Why?” the blonde ventured.“Lay face down on the seat and shut up, cunt,” I answered.She did.I turned my attention to the brunette. Her cervine eyes were brimming. “What areyou going to do to us?” she asked so breathlessly I knew she lived in fear of myanswer. I rattled a pair of cuffs in my right hand; in my left was the smallpistol.Her eyes lowered to the instrument of death; her arms went behind her back, andshe put her wrists together in a gesture of submission. An apt pupil. Thewristcuffs snicked into place. I locked them and tossed the key out the windowinto the dark.“You’re going to kill us, aren’t you?” the brunette asked.I dropped my hand to her bosom, surveyed the contours of the warm flesh beneathher blouse, studied the quick rhythms of her heartbeat, and gently squeezed asweetly scented breast. I went up against her ear with my lips, licked the lobeand toyed with the small gold stud.“Yes,” I stated without rancor, “I’m going to kill you.”A sob floated up from the throat of the blonde.“Shut up, bitch.”She seemed to increase her weeping.“You don’t have to kill me,” the brunette ventured as if it were a greatrevelation. “I’ll do whatever you want…and I’ll never tell anyone.” She soundedutterly sincere. I ran my hand up her skirt and she parted her legs in eagersubmission. I found her encased in nylon pantyhose, her cunnus arid, herposturing sexuality a sham. I pushed at the covered portals with my fingers. Shehumped and grunted, “Oh! It’s so good!”I spit in her face and got out of the car, went around to the trunk and openedit. I returned to my little vamp and opened the door for her. She stared at mewith an uncertain desperation. I pointed the pistol at her cleavage. She openedher mouth to scream, but it died in her lying throat as I reached forward andjammed the fuzzy Spaulding tennis ball into her mouth, tying it in place with astrip of bed-sheet.A length of clothesline secured her ankles, and I yanked her forward, draped herover my shoulder and dropped her into the trunk. I fired a single shot into theroadside gravel and turned my attentions toward the blonde, who’d popped up offthe seat the instant the gun went off.I opened the rear door of the sedan. In the dim coach light I could see tearsglistening through her makeup. I stared at the dark, wet stain at her crotch.The wetness slowly began to creep down the inside of her thighs.“Where’s Betsy?” the blonde demanded.“In the trunk with a bullet hole behind her ear. Same place you’re going unlessyou do what I say.”The blonde made a contemptuous face and cleared her nostrils with an equinesnort; snot rushed out over her lips. She made a gagging noise deep in herthroat. I cocked the pistol and pointed it at her.“If I do what you want will you let me go?” There was a thread of hope in herquestion. I severed it deftly.“No. But if you treat me real nice I won’t cut off your nipples before I slityour throat.”She stared at me in mute apprehension. She began to tremble, the wetnessglistening at her crotch and spreading downward almost to her knees. Then sheleaned forward and vomited onto the back seat.I seized her long blonde hair and dragged her toward me. She knelt in the grasswheezing and coughing and spitting. I gave her a minute to collect herself, thentook out my throbbing erection.She glanced at it and turned her head away. The long curved blade of my skinningknife opened her blouse, and parted the straps of her sensible white cottonbrassiere. I put the blade against a soft conical pink nipple, and watched itharden into a bud at the touch of the cold steel. I pressed the blade againsther breast. She trembled uncontrollably. I listened to the soft spluttering; apungent barnyard aroma swirled up from the seat of her jeans.“I’m so scared.” It was a statement, an explanation, a plea. “Please. Pleasedon’t hurt me.” Her eyes caught my own. I looked into her hopelessness, herdefeat.“Suck it.”She closed her eyes and opened her mouth. I slid my cock in and pushed it downher throat, clamped her head to my crotch with my hand and came at once. Theblonde pitched forward and began to vomit some more.I stood over her gagging form, leaned over and caressed her cheek. “You werereal good, honey. Never had such wonderful head. You wanna do it again?”She began to cry in earnest, as if her poor heart would burst with sadness.“Please. Please don’t hurt me. I just want to go home. I did what you wanted.”As she whined my penis stiffened again. I jerked her head up and let her look atthe twitching, bulbous stalk. She closed her eyes and opened her mouth.“Just lick the head of it for a while, honey.”She lapped obediently while I held her fast, my right hand holding the knife toher throat. I came in her face this time, simultaneously cutting her jugular.Twenty minutes later the blonde was neatly wrapped in black Hefty garbage bagsand lying next to Betsy in the trunk. We were going to have us a burying. Three hours from Orlando I turned off a State highway onto a dirt track thatmeandered through slash pine and old water oak. I caught the crimson shine ofpossum eyes patrolling the undergrowth for fresh carrion. They must have sensedmy approach.I parked the sedan beneath an ancient oak and cut the ignition, sat and listenedto the cooling of the engine, while I watched the moonlight cast shadows acrossthe little glade. Uncapped a bottle of Wild Turkey and took a long pull. Isavored the idea of the cute brunette in the trunk sucking on a tennis ball.I fished through her purse. Checked her ID: Betsy Brown, high school junior,sixteen. A 130 pound bag of blood and shit. A second ID gave the name of LorettaDevereaux, age 22. Betsy’s ticket to party. I could hear her soft snufflingthrough the fabric of the back seat. Fate is cruel. Everyone knows that. I emerged from the car, walked to the rear and turned the key in the trunk. As Ilifted it, the rank odor of sweat-sodden female billowed out, causing me to takea step back. I shined my powerful 6-cell flashlight into her wide, apprehensiveeyes. She blinked owlishly; her nostrils flared, taking in the sweet, cool nightair. Her white linen gag was soaked with saliva, smeared with pink lipstick; hercheeks bulged unnaturally. She could not speak except with her eyes, and thoseeyes made a plea for mercy.I reached for her, took a handful of hair and jerked her out of the trunk,flinging her onto the ground. She rolled, skirt around her waist, white buttocksflashing beneath the sheer taupe pantyhose. She lay on her face breathingheavily.I approached her, kicked her smartly in the ribs, and listened to the suppressedscream behind the gag. It hardened my cock. I unbuckled my pants and drew themoff. Knelt behind the shivering bitch and flipped her skirt forward over herhead, rolled down the pantyhose then slickened her cunt and anus with a handfulof spit.I rubbed the head of my turgid penis along the crack of her behind. She made noeffort to resist until she felt the push against her anus. She bowed her back inoutrage and tried to roll away, clenching and knotting her buttocks against me.I arose and returned to the trunk of my car. Flung the plastic-wrapped corpse ofthe blonde out onto the earth and removed it from the bags. I could feel Betsy’seyes following me. She lay still as a rock in the shadows. I took two steelconcrete reinforcing rods from the trunk, and pushed them into the earth. Then Isevered the blonde’s head, carried it to a steel spike and mashed her head downupon it. There was a curious squish as the rod went up into her brain, and goobegan to drip on the ground.I returned to Betsy. “I want some ass, whore, or your head will be on the otherstick.” Betsy made love like a dream. I woke up with the dawn, my head on my lover’s belly. Betsy was already awake,unmoving but watching with rapt fascination as a dozen possums fed on thecarrion blonde. They’d eaten a hole in her belly and were busy gutting her withsharp teeth.I yawned, stood up and stretched, sauntered over to where the blonde’s headviewed the morning through glazed eyes. I took out my dick and pissed in herashen face; watched the possums trundle off into the high grass leaving theirmeal unfinished. I moved to the car and fetched a shovel from the trunk. Icalled to Betsy, “You’ve got to bury her ass, she’s beginning to stink.”I marked out a grave with the blade of my shovel. “Six feet long, four feetwide, and say a good six feet deep. That ought to do it. Don’t you think so?” Ilooked to Betsy. She nodded dully.I walked over to her and unlocked her cuffs with a second key from my keyring.Her wrists were raw and bloody. She immediately reached for the gag. I slappedher face hard, spinning her around, knocking her flat on the moist earth ofearly morning. I glowered down at her. A mockingbird trilled in the brush. Therewas a busy drone of flies around the blonde.I told her, “You dig that grave, girl. Dig it deep. Deep enough for two. If youeven give me the idea you want to try something cute, I’ll tie you up and startcutting until you’re in little bite-sized pieces for the critters. Understand?”She nodded solemnly. I answered her unspoken question. “If you’re a good girl,we’ll make love again.” She got to her feet, leaving a large urine-soaked spoton the sand. She went to the shovel and began to work. I removed the cuffs fromthe dead blonde. Flies covered the stump of her neck, the opening in her belly.There was the sharp metallic smell of blood over the rotten stench of openedguts.By noon the grave was finished. Betsy’s hands were blistered and raw, and herblood streaked the shaft of the shovel. She handed the shovel out to me. Irolled the blonde’s corpse to the edge of the grave and kicked it in. Flieshovered in a black cloud. I jerked the head off the iron spike and pitched ittoward the grave. It bounced once and dropped in. Two points.I went to the car and brought back the two purses. Dropped the blonde’s into thegrave. “Lay her out decent,” I told Betsy. I watched as Betsy arranged theblonde on her back, carefully folding her hands across her bosom, arranging thehead at the correct angle, setting the purse beside it. I knelt at the edge ofthe pit and masturbated as Betsy went about her work.When she was done I said, “Now you, Betsy dear.”She hesitated. Ground water was beginning to seep into the grave.I leaped into the hole and smashed the heel of my hand into Betsy’s nose,crushing it. Blood fountained into my face, over my hands. She dropped to herknees, choking on her own spew of blood.My blade cut away her skirt; it fell. I ran it along her crotch, slicing nylonand cuntflesh. I mounted her as she blew bloody spray into my face through hernose.The knife went to her throat; cleaved through to her spine. Her vaginacontracted in a death spasm and I sprayed her with seed. I licked the blood fromher cheeks before I dismounted.“I love you, Betsy.”My whispered endearment drew no response other than the incessant drone of thefeeding flies.MURDER DEMONSTorture for the sake of torture did not interest me. It was, in those days,important for me to feel good about what I was doing. Whores were agents ofevil, and as a good Catholic young man I had no difficulty with what one mightconsider philosophical gray areas. There was good and evil; a well-defined lineran between the two. Whores were evil.Whores were to be killed. Once that decision was made, the problem became how todo it successfully. A great deal of practical study went into the matter. Thewhore had to be selected, transported, killed and disposed of. The best way tokill T them was to hang them. It was convenient, quick, effective, silent andtidy except for the excrements.The alternative method was usually the use of a plastic bag. The bag was tiedover the whore’s head and she died by suffocation. This method was convenient,silent and effective, but it was far slower than hanging and much messier. I gotto the point where I’d push such women out of the car after tying on the plasticbag. It was less unpleasant for me that way.There were variations on the kills. I’m speaking only in generalities here atthe moment, so that you can understand that there was a plan and purpose andthis was never a situation where some sex-crazed madman was snatching girls fromthe public streets every time the moon turned full.Returning to this thing about torture…My experience was that whores see eventsin terms of sexuality. Please consider the speed involved in a kill. A transientroad whore is agreeable to suck cock; she has no qualms when driven to a remotearea.I’d pull the gun and handcuff her, get out of the car. I’d go around to her sideand get her out. She might say, “What are you doing?” or “I’m not into kinkystuff.”I’d take her back by the trunk, open it, take out the noosed rope, put the nooseover her head, pitch the other end up over a limb, tie it to the trailer hitch,get back in the car, start it up, put it in drive and the whore would be pulledup. We are talking three minutes on an average; five at the very most, betweencuffing and the suspension. The victim doesn’t realize what’s happening untilshe’s actually dangling, it’s that fast.Many kills were completely impersonal. The victim had revealed herself to be awhore and my responsibility, as I saw it, was to kill her. The killing wasusually done quickly without any sexual molestation, rape or brutality. I knewhow to set the noose so that the victim would be rendered almost instantlyunconscious. I’d read the journals of the 19th century hangmen and knew exactlythe point to apply pressure to cut off oxygen to the victim’s brain. Somekillings were almost peaceful. The whore would shiver, convulse, kick a bit andthen be still.As you might expect, this sort of kill was fairly boring. There was no stalking,no challenging ruse, no fun. The real enjoyment was in the hunt. The kill wassatisfying, but the clean-up was work.There is a post-kill depression that must be overcome. The initial impulse is tothrow the corpse in a ditch, a canal, a hasty hole, to be rid of it at once. Theaverage killer cannot deal with the actual harsh reality of the act. He has nosense of responsible purpose, no long-term commitment to what he’s doing. A lustkiller murders for sex, and once he’s fulfilled his lust, he dumps the corpseand flees from the scene, and from himself as well. He looks back on the eventand feels guilt rather than triumph.There came a time when I decided to make the game more interesting. I did thisby introducing the concept that it would be better if the whore understood shewas to be hanged and concurred in my decision to destroy her and what she stoodfor. I felt that if she understood what the ultimate good purpose was, that ourexperience would be a fulfilling one of shared intimacy.I’d read a number of accounts where the hangmen had sex with condemned females;the women were agreeable to the intimacy and acquiescent on the scaffold. Iwondered how that might be: fuck the whore, then hang her, with the whoreknowing she would die at the conclusion of the sex. It was a remarkable concept,and certainly not unique to the world, so I decided to try it. Let me tell youhere about one very special experience….The whores were mostly sad, stupid, moralless young women who, when confrontedwith the finality of their situation, simply fell apart emotionally. They’dlisten for a few minutes and then begin a downhill slide punctuated by tears,slimy snot and pissy pants. The nicer I’d be, the more I’d try to make themunderstand, the faster they’d dissolve into great bawling sobs. But there weresome exceptions.The very finest of these exceptions was a wonderfully attractive young call-girlfrom Omaha who had just come down to Miami to try her hand at the snowbirdtrade. I was introduced to her by a friend who’d suggested we go visit her andget our dicks sucked. We went to her trick pad and my buddy went with her andgot sucked off. When I went with her, I declined the blow job; instead I made anappointment with her for an all-night sex fest. She was agreeable, evenenthusiastic. We set a date.I was absolutely smitten by this sexy whore. She was lively, intelligent, andhad a sensuous figure. I was enchanted. I wanted our assignation to be special.I went right out and bought her a brand new rope. I knew she’d look exquisiteswinging at the end of it. I took great care in selecting it.As the date approached, I called her to confirm our evening together. Iinstructed her on what to wear. I wanted to see her in pink and black. She hadlong blonde hair fixed in ringlets that would look so nice against a blackevening dress. Black heels and stockings with a garter belt. Pink bra and panty.A frilly brief. She assured me she’d look her best for me.Never before had I been so taken with a whore. I was furious. She was seducingme and I was helpless before her daunting sexuality. She would have to sufferfor that. Yes, suffer. I drove out to Davie and purchased an excellenthorsewhip. I’d put her to the lash before hanging her! She’d pay for herseduction!The following days I spent clearing an area in the center of a melaleuca copse.I hacked out an area the size of a large room with a narrow entrance trail. Iassembled the gallows beam, nailing it up between two trees. On a second tree, Istripped off the small branches, hammered in a piton and hooked a pulley to it.The tree formed a living whipping post.I dug her grave. Deep. Down to limestone bedrock. I hauled in two twenty-gallonbuckets of water from a canal. I carefully surveyed the scene and then went backto town and purchased a step-ladder. It was just what was needed. I arranged thenoosed rope over the gallows beam. Brought in a pair of Coleman lanterns andextra fuel. Towels. Knives. Buckets. Accessories. Everything was perfect for thewhore.I picked her up at her Dade County trick pad. She looked stunning. I bought herprime rib at the Forge. She ate a hearty last meal. Baked Alaska and brandy. Iwondered if she’d be able to keep it down. Sometimes whores would puke. It washard to predict and always messy. We drove north on route 27 through the night.I told her how beautiful she was, how much I’d been looking forward to ourromance to come. She yawned, burped, leaned against the car door and seemed todoze. She was bored. She’d heard it all before, many times. A beautiful boredwhore. I knew I’d soon have her complete attention. She’d see me through neweyes. She’d be alert to every nuance of my speech. I watched her light up acigarette and stare into the night. Her last night.I soon had the car parked at the end of a limerock road at the edge of atrackless swamp. She looked puzzled. I cut the engine, pulled out a small pistoland put it to her face. She gasped. I got her cuffed. She was mine. All mine.Forever. It had taken less than a minute. Her initial thoughts were of sex. Abondage scene, she thought. She told me she didn’t do kinky stuff. I wasagreeable.Drew her toward me for a kiss. She pulled away. She didn’t want to kiss me. Shedemanded I remove the cuffs. Demanded! I just said no. She glared. Such a prettyfit of pique. All full of roast beef and ice cream and booze.I needed to soften her hard look so I said, “Flies love a cunt but prefer adirty shit hole. Are you aware of that?”She just stared at me. Blinked. The hardness was replaced by wariness. “What doyou mean?” she asked cautiously. I explained it to her. She said, “Please takeme home.” The first “please” of the evening. She was learning manners. Iwondered if she’d say, “please kill me” before the sun set the eastern horizonon fire. I shook my head, took out my penis, and instructed her to suck on it.Then I opened a switchblade and told her that if I felt her teeth on my cock I’dslit her throat. Quickly. Expertly.She nodded. Kept her eyes on the knife. “Please don’t cut me. I’ll do whateveryou want.” I told her to think of my dick as a straw, and to suck my balls dry.She slid over, put her face in my lap and began to lick my penis. She got it upand took it in her mouth. I pressed the blade to her neck, and held it in placewith my left hand. With my right, I explored underneath her skirt, squeezed thepanty-covered labial lips. She bobbed her head up and down professionally, hertongue laved my shaft.I slipped a finger under the elastic of her panty; her crease was dry. I ran afinger up her vagina. She made no response but to suck more fervently. My fingerdrifted to her anus, and pushed into its center. She tightened her sphincter. Ipushed my finger all the way up into her and felt soft turd. Put my thumb in hervagina. I could feel the thin wall of muscle separating the two vaults. Warmdrool ran down over my balls. I could hear the smack of her lips, the slurp ofhot saliva. My crotch was wet with her spit. I fingered her anus, thumbed hercunt. Time passed.She came up off my cock with an apology. There was a ring of frothy white salivaencircling her mouth, a clown’s greasepaint. I told her to get back on the job.She said she’d had enough, she’d done what I wanted. There was an edge to hervoice.I took my finger out of her butt, my thumb out of her twat. I reached over andrubbed my finger under her nose. She drew back, eyes large and snapping withannoyance. Then she saw me put my finger in my mouth. I began to lick it. Shewatched, enthralled, the spit wet on her chin, the corners of her mouthglistening. “Flies truly love it,” I told her.She made a noise deep in her throat, swallowing. I licked my finger again andasked her if she wanted to throw up. “Take me home,” she said, halfheartedlylooking away, sensing there would be no going home for her ever.“Gimme a little kiss,” I ordered. She turned toward me and shook her headfuriously, eyes downcast, almost demure.I pulled up my trousers and let myself out of the car, went around to her sideand opened the door, grabbed her by the hair, and jerked her out of the car. Iflung her into the weeds and put the beam of the flashlight on her. She rolledto a sitting position, skirt bunched around her waist, black garter strapsagainst the soft white flesh between her stocking tops and panty. Eyes rivalingthose of a jacklighted doe - all wide, wet, startled, full of uncertainty.I pulled her to her feet by her hair, turned a beam of light toward a narrowpath leading into the copse of trees. I gave her a push. She stood fast beforethe dark entrance. I came up behind her, put my arms around her and drew her tome. I licked her neck, her ear, the line of her jaw, pressed my hard cock intoher rump. “I’m going to stick it in you. Your cunt. Your ass. I’ll fuck younice.” I felt her tense. She took a step forward. I took one back. She pivotedand swung a kick toward my balls that missed and made her stumble. I laughed.Took out the knife. She screamed. I stepped toward her. Tripped her, rolled herface down in the leaves, pressed the blade to her cheek. “Shut up!” I snarled.She went silent.Beneath me, the well-fueled engine of her body huffed and puffed. I could hearher panting, feel her breathing hard beneath my own body. She was damp with herexertions. Mosquitoes hummed around us. Frogs sang a chorus in the swamp nearby.I smelled her perfume, the moist earth, the rotting vegetation around us. A jetwhined far above, the whore whined below.She sobbed, instinctively understanding the price of failure. “Please. Please.Please,” she murmured. I put the point of the knife to the corner of her eye.Told her I’d poke it out if she screamed, kicked, or misbehaved. Whispering, Iasked her if she understood. She sobbed, nodded a little. I ran my hand up herleg, squeezed her buttocks. She lay still, unresponsive.I stood up. Brought her to her feet by her hair. Returned her to the car. I satwith her. The night was still young. She asked to blow her nose. I let her snortsnot into my handkerchief. She wanted a cigarette. I lit one for her, stuck itin her mouth. She sucked on in greedily. I watched her, she watched me. Deathwatch. I let her spit the cigarette butt into the dash ashtray. She leaned backagainst the door. Great crescents of dark sweat stained her evening dress, herperfume mingled with the sour acrid stink coming from under her arms, leaves andseeds ornamented her bodice, her knees were pushing through her nylons.She sucked in her bottom lip, closed here eyes, laid her greatest fear before melike a gift. “I don’t want to die,” she muttered, a statement as true as themoon, the stars, the eternal abyss, the gray mosquito feasting on her cheek.“You’ll live to see the sunrise,” I promised. “Why me?” she asked the night.“Oh, God, help me,” she prayed, her voice catching in her throat. She lifted hereyes and asked, “What do you want from me?”I opened myself to her instincts and intuitions, let her touch the truth nakedin my eyes. She saw her own fleeting mortality, the transient nature of herearthly existence; murder demons, capering.She lowered her head and began to cry, hopeless sobs that left me untouched. I’dseen it before, understood the way of the whore. The cascading tears, thestreaming wet cheeks, forerunners to the viscous nasal snot that would leave herface and bosom beslimed. The ultimate gambit.I rudely seized her nose with my left hand and forced a jumbo Kotex napkin intoher mouth with my right. I tied it in place with a nylon stocking. Her eyes werewide and blinking. Her throat working furiously. She suddenly blew her nose.Tendrils of mucus whipped out, clung to her cheeks, soiled her dress. Shesquirmed with fear and alarm. Her clever words silenced, her verbal ploysstifled, all her plans in disarray. There was a stench of sweat. Her flanks weresodden with it. Her tresses were becoming lank and greasy. There were twigs andleaves in her hair. I pulled her to me and wiped her nose, her chin, her mouth.I tasted her tears. Kissed her eyes, promised her that I would treasure hermemory for a lifetime, that we would become one in flesh and in spirit. Thewhore began to weep anew, but with a refreshing sincerity.My experience is that women have a predisposition toward deceit. Whores lie.They are creatures of expediency and calculated illusion. A commercial menstrualrag will stanch the incontinent flow of lies from a whore’s mouth as well as thebloody slops from her cunt. Great truths are better communicated tacitly, with alook, a gesture, a smile.I’d promised the whore a sunrise, then turned her world upside down. She lookedcomic and vulnerable hanging by her ankles. Her head was in an empty 20-gallonbucket, her shoulders hard against the metal rim. She was so quiet I thought shemight be unconscious. The night had subsided, and a gray light filled the tinyglade. The sun would soon be up.I picked my way over to her and shined my flashlight beam into her face. Hereyes were wet and alive, blinking against the sudden glare. Mosquitoes rose fromthe bucket in a swarm to settle on her clothes. Her exposed flesh was a galaxyof tiny red welts. The flying insects of the night had fed well. The day shiftwould fare even better.FLIES IN HER EYESimage [Images/228.jpg]The killer researchers to hear about the trolling at twilight for victims; thesex freaks want to hear about the special thrill of finding a little minx with asmooth-shaved pussy; the sadists want to hear how the bimbo begs, and how youthreaten her: does she want a stiff dick up her ass or eight inches of coldsteel in her navel?I know all you folks have your special interests, but this time we’re going tohear about the practical side of serial murder.Successful serial killing requires skill. More than fifty whores died at PondApple Swamp. Each died with her wrists chained behind her, peering out at thefading world through a cheap plastic bag.Pushing them out into the weeds merely prevented them from peeing on the seatcovers and stinking up the car; that was a sensible panacea for the problem oftheir filthiness.Go out and bag one of these road sluts yourself, you’ll see what I mean. Yousee, when you get down to basics, there’s nothing particularly sexy about it.Popular novelists make murder sound erotic, like it was the ultimate sexualthrill, but the reality of it is something else altogether. It’s nasty.I spotted her at first light. She’d emerged from a semi that had cranked up andheaded south toward Miami. I’d watched her study a road map and wander over tostand at the junction of State Road 84. She’d waved her thumb at a few carsrolling east. I pulled out of the Everglades Cafe and in a moment the pickup wasmade.She was a semi-hippie, a Hoosier townie girl who didn’t fit in back home withher love beads, her long hair, and her braless boobs. She was heading into Ft.Lauderdale, and said she’d be hanging out at the beach. Maybe get a waitressjob.She had these nice teats jiggling around under her peasant blouse, so I said toher, “I’ll give you twenty dollars if you’ll let me feel your boobies while yougive me a blow job.”She took the pass right in stride. Told me OK without a glimmer of eroticinterest, and that was that. No hassle or negotiation. Just “OK.” She was smellyfrom the road. Probably hadn’t had a bath since she departed Indiana. The longhair was lank and greasy. There were crescent-shaped stains of dried sweat underher arms.Her jeans needed a wash, and her hiking shoes were caked with mud. She dozed aswe rolled east.I pulled off State Road 84 when I got to Pond Apple Swamp, a pestilential tractof real estate populated by mosquitoes and water moccasins. There was a tinysand track next to an oil pipeline right of way. I pulled the car in there, andwe were concealed from the road by a screen of Brazilian pepper bushes. The girlyawned and stretched herself in the seat of the car. I fished a twenty out of mywallet and handed it to her. She accepted it without comment and put it into herpurse. When she looked at me again she saw a 9mm pistol leveled at her gut.“Do as I say and you won’t be hurt,” I said.She nodded. Uncertain.“Turn your back to me and put your hands behind you.”She did as she was told. Twisted around in her seat. I handcuffed her, quicklypulled a plastic bag over her head, tied it in place with a nylon stocking,reached across to the door latch, opened the door, and shoved her out into theweeds.I let her thrash around for five minutes or so while I went through her purse.Retrieved my cash and hers as well. They always have a little money tucked away.For an emergency.It was a pleasing kill, no problems at all. I got out of the car and found theyoung would-be penis-sucker face-down in the grass. There were already fliescrawling across her denim-clad rump, whizzing around seeking out the source ofthe stink.I uncuffed her wrists and rolled her over on her back. Her brown eyes were openwide and empty, slightly bugged. Some bloody snot was smeared around her nose;her tongue was sticking out a bit and there was considerable drool all over herchin. I’d seen them vomit into the bag, but this whore wasn’t too bad at all.I returned to the car and put her knapsack and purse in the trunk, locked up thevehicle and resigned myself to tote the bitch into the swamp.So there I was, looking down at the bug-eyed corpse. Her aroma was not about toimprove, so I leaned down, draped her over my shoulder, and hauled her away intothe vastness of the trackless mire that was Pond Apple Swamp.I knew every inch of the Pond Apple. It was a good quarter mile to where Iwanted to go, and what little trail there was at all was usually underwater. Islogged along, keeping an eye cocked for snakes. I had me a little camp back inthere, a place to take my girlies, where we could be assured of absoluteprivacy.I’d been out to Colorado working the major mountain passes in the front range.Hippie chicks heading for the Haight, starry-eyed wannabe starlets angling for aspot in Hollywood, hookers shooting for Las Vegas - their bones litter namelessmineshafts on the road west. Down they went by the ones, twos and threes.Killed me plenty on the road west of Denver, and while I was out there I learnedabout pitons. These are devices used for rock climbing. A piton is basicallyjust a circular metal ring at the end of a spike. I bought me a bunch and hauledthem to Florida and hammered them into the trunk of a huge old strangler figtree deep in the swamp.There was a little island out there, dry ground most of the year. Probably anold Indian mound. It was a long haul through water and muck with a hundred andthirty pounds of dead meat over my shoulder, around which hundreds of flies wereswirling, drawn by the stink of the whore. I managed to get her there safely,and plopped her down on one of the raised roots of the fig.Two weeks earlier I’d had the good luck to bag a pair of fourteen year oldrunaways from a state training school for delinquent girls. Cute little thingswho promised to suck my peter dry in exchange for a lid of grass. The only thingI let them lick was the inside of the plastic bag I’d tied over their heads. I’dhauled them back to the camp and left them upright, their wrists wired to thepitons pounded into the old tree. I strung them up naked, except for the cheappeace sign necklaces. It amused me to see those satanic symbols dangling betweentheir little boobies.That had been two weeks earlier. Now there was nothing left but a pair ofwithered forearms that were wired up high enough to be out of reach of thecarrion eaters. The rest of the bones were scattered about the small island. Thepeace necklaces were at the base of the tree next to the ivory white skulls. Ithad only been two weeks and the girls were completely skeletonized.I was delighted. I walked around collecting the scattered bones and put them ina pile. I couldn’t leave them heaped up on the island to await a chancediscovery. That wouldn’t do at all.I pulled the peasant blouse over the head of the Hoosier girl and noticed thatshe did indeed have a fine pair of teats. I removed her shoes and socks,unfastened her jeans and pulled them down. The white nylon underpants were full.I’d come to notice that early morning kills were usually far dirtier thanafternoon and evening kills.I stood over the half-naked corpse and stroked my cock. I ejaculated almostinstantly. A few minutes later I pissed on the whore, directing my stream overher breasts and belly to wash off my semen. That took the edge off my emotions.I zipped up and occupied myself with wiring the whore’s wrists together withheavy-gauge leader wire. I ran a length of poly-pro line under the wrists, putthe cord through the dead-eye of the piton and hauled the whore to her feet,then let her down a notch so that she sagged languidly with her arms stretchedabove her head. Nice figure. She was pretty enough, even with her head in aplastic bag.The day would be hot and humid, a fine day for decomposition. I studied the deadface behind the clear plastic. The eyeballs were already turning milky but thewhore retained the marvelous look of wide-eyed discovery I’d seen so often whenusing the plastic bag on them. Her head was slightly tilted. The area around themouth was drooly, the lips moist, the gray tongue just sticking out enough topress against the plastic. Nice.I slid the knife blade beneath the knotted nylon and cut it, removing the bagfrom her head. Flies descended immediately on her face and crawled across theeyeballs, buzzing with delight. A juicy morsel.By high noon I had tidied up the island area. The bones of the two delinquentbimbos were neatly packed in two separate plastic garbage bags, awaiting a tripto the quicksand pits further back in the swamp.Corpses are generally found because they stink beyond belief. I always had aremote place to take a girl, somewhere she could rot undisturbed.I eyed the whore. Her guts were beginning to swell. A good sign. The gases hadforced everything in her intestines out the rear door, and her underpants wereloaded with fermenting feces. Purplish blood was spiraling down the insides ofher ivory thighs. The lining of her uterus was commencing to collapse and runout her vagina. Already her lips, nostrils and eyes were covered with whatappeared to be white grains of rice. She was beginning to stiffen, but thatwould pass too. Everything would be fine.The Pond Apple Swamp quicksand pits descend into the limestone caverns beneaththe land itself. From time to time these pits boil up as springs. Be soincautious as to step in one of these shallow springs and you will vanish intothe bowels of the earth without a trace.Watching my step with infinite care, I emptied out the two bags of alabasterbones and then one by one, pitched them out into the bubbling spring. They’dsink, sit on the sandy bottom for a minute or so, and then just slip into theeternal sands, as though they’d never existed.By three in the afternoon, I’d returned to my whore. She needed me to help herprepare to meet her new friends. I removed the gold posts from her pierced ears,and the rings from her fingers. They’d want her naked and unadorned. I helpedher out of her soiled panties, being careful to avoid her filth.The brown mat of public hair was entirely ordinary, and matted with filth andblood. I took out my penis and urinated on her crotch. It washed her off alittle, but she was still a mess. Hopeless and disgusting as only her kind canbe.I watched as her backside seemed to vanish beneath the living blanket of blackand green blowflies, going about their business competing with the ants for afulfilling meal. What they seemed to need was better access to the yummy parts.I drew my long-bladed skinning knife from my belt sheath, and pushed it into herjust beneath the breastbone. Then I drew it downward to her pubic area, openinga neat incision. Gas hissed from her belly.I gagged at the stench of her fetid guts, but the flies seemed to burst intojoyous song, increasing their industrious drone and buzzing tenfold. They seemedto be up to the task ahead.I turned my attention to the rope holding the whore up, loosening it and lettingher sag until she was on her knees. Her viscera flopped out of her belly andrested on her thighs. The sightless eyes seemed to stare at her belly throughthe curtain of white worms, her head hung forward between the upraised arms.Appropriate. On her knees. Doing a whore’s penance.I punched the thin blade through her eyeball into her brain. Fluids from theburst eyeball ran over her cheek and dripped down between her swinging bosomsinto her lap full of grayish guts. Good.I inserted the blade into the second eye. The flies buzzed furiously, raising uponly to return with renewed vigor. Flies in her eyes, ants up her nose. Satan’shelpers carrying away his own little by little, in microscopic pieces.The shadows were beginning to lengthen. The heat and humidity remainedoppressive; the whore was rotting wonderfully. With nightfall the creatures ofthe swamp would come to her, feed on her flesh, rip out her innards and dragthem through the stagnant waters, adding to their stench.Already I could hear them splashing, drawn to the blood scent. They would devourher, gnaw her bones. The swamp beasties have to eat just like anyone else, don’tthey? They were accustomed to being well fed at my little island haven. Wastenot want not. And thus we are an integral part of the food chain.I turned away from the rotting pile of meat, and kept an eye cocked for deadlysnakes. It was tedious slogging back to the roadway, but the slut needed herprivacy. I left her to rot in peace, to become one with nature.I know what you’re going to say! You’ll say that this story is disgusting, andthat I’m an evil fiend for committing it to paper. You who relish the latestepisode of Friday the Thirteenth, and countless other occasions of mindless sexand violence. You love to be shocked. You’re fascinated by depravity.Yes, you! The very ones who memorize the slaughters of a Ted Bundy or a HenryLee Lucas, and then dance and caper in an orgy of self-righteousness when thesedark folk heroes are executed by the State. You revel in violence: murder, war,execution, every manner of social disaster. Your TV and film industries thriveon it. You’re begging for a close-up look at murder—the real thing. And you dareto criticize me?image [Images/232.jpg]BLOODY INSTRUCTIONSMalignant IntelligenceI recognized at once the smirking famous face, and my heart skipped a beat asTed Bundy fixed his gaze on me with a sudden grin of recognition as if he weremeeting an old friend. The year was 1986; the venue, Florida State Prison. We were in the visiting areaused by inmates who are condemned or in maximum security. Ted came striding overand said, “I know you!” He was personable and self-assured, confident in hisdemeanor, but I could see the madness blazing and snapping behind his eyes. Andnow that malignant intelligence focused on me as it had once focused upon thehelpless victims he had left dead in the broad wake of his journeys acrossAmerica.Tender Victims“I know your face from the detective magazines,” he challenged. “You’reSchaefer, aren’t you?”Cautiously I admitted that I was indeed, and what of it anyway?“We’ve got to talk,” he said. It was a command, and also an opportunity not tobe missed by one interested in going into the dark shadows world of humanexistence. I agreed that we should get together, and found myself lookingforward to I talking to the famous fiend in private. Ted arranged it with afriendly medical orderly, and he and I were soon put in for medical call-outs atthe same time.We were not supposed to take anything with us when we went to a medicalcall-out, but when I left the cell I stuck the news clipping from the May 13,1973 Palm Beach Post down into my pocket. When the guard searched me and askedme about it, I merely told him it was an item of legal material concerning mycase, and with a quick look he let it go.I was taken down the hallway and locked in a holding cage next to Ted. Forseveral hours we were left in the cramped little cells side by side. It wasthere I first encountered the evil personified by this human monster known asTed Bundy.I found myself recoiling with revulsion, yet curiously fascinated.While we waited to see the doctor I took out the newspaper clipping and slid itthrough the bars. He read it with apparent interest and questioned me about it.One of the first things that he noticed about the accusations was that I wasalleged to have killed two girls in Pompano Beach in the eight and nine year oldrange. Ted told me that he had never been able to grab a kid that young, that hereally was not attracted to kids of that age at all. I mentioned that he wasconvicted of killing a girl of age 12, but he defended this act on the groundsthat he did not know when he grabbed her that she was so young. He claimed thatshe was matured beyond what anyone would have expected a 12 year old to be. Thegirl had well-developed breasts and looked older than she was, and that is whathad caused him to make the grab.That did not stop him from being curious about what it was like to snatch andmurder a pair of prepubescent kids. I told Ted that I had been reading a storyin a magazine about the life of Albert Fish. I read how Fish had developed ataste for human flesh and I wanted to give it a try. Fish had claimed that younggirls made the best eating, so I grabbed a pair that looked tasty.You should have seen his face when I told him that! He wanted to know if I hadcooked them, and I told him that I had taken the pair to a remote area andslaughtered them, and then roasted them over an open fire on a spit. He couldn’tget over it, the very idea had him squirming on the bench. He wanted to hear allabout it and of course, I provided him with all the details that he could everwant - and more.Murder FrenzyTed was really not into the outer limits of sexual depravity. He was a ghoul,and what he did was to be expected of a person who was into ghoulism. Hispersonal technique was more on the order of spotting an opportunity, making hiscapture, and then taking his victim to a quiet place for the kill. The killswere made in a variety of ways, but that too was a matter of convenience. Hismore common modes were ligature strangulation or beating to death with an objectsuch as a tire iron or a club.This was usually done in a frenzy, for as he was getting into the act it seemedto him that a power or force was coming over him that made him go wild andsavage. After the killing he took his pleasure with the corpse in a moreleisurely manner, and depending on the situation, he might save the corpse forfuture use or he might simply dump it after he was sexually sated.I found all this very interesting because once Ted opened up, he really spun outthe tales and you could see that he was transporting himself back into time andreliving his acts. I watched him recite his murderous deeds with a smirk on hisface and an erection bulging in his trousers. Ted loved his evil acts.Showing him the Post story really got his undivided attention. By making Tedthink I had more experience, it was as if he was trying to show me that he didin fact out-perform me. I would listen to him talk for a while, then I wouldtoss out some new depravity and he would consider that before trying to top it.Ted was, of course, fascinated by my tales of murder as well. I told him that ifone was intent to make a lifestyle of murder that he should achieve maximumpleasure from the acts while he was able to do so, since sooner or later therewould be some slip-up and the fun and games would come to an end.Ted wanted to know whether I had ever confided to any mental health workers thatI was a ghoul, and what their reactions were. He was actually embarrassed abouthis affinity for corpses, and if I were not careful he would retreat back intohimself. Of course, I told him that I had confided my own love of corpses to mylegions of shrinks over the years, but that they were a nonjudgmental lot andthere was never any problem. They were bound by the rules of doctor/patientconfidentiality, and that prohibited them from revealing my secrets. I told himthat the shrinks were mostly curious about it, rather than being critical.Then there was the discussion about the messiness of murder and the generalreactions of the victims while they were being killed. We went around a bitabout that and I gave Ted a number of good pointers on how to keep the messinessto a minimum. The one particular incident that put him off the most was themurder of Denise Naslund. He had captured her while she was on her way to theladies’ toilet at a state park and when he was finished with her murder, therewas urine and manure all over his car.I explained to him that it was to due to his impetuous and frenzied actions thathe was having all these problems. That his actions were too hot-blooded andfilled with passion, and that he should have taken a more reasoning approach tothe problem of the victims making a mess all over the place. He asked how thatwas possible under the circumstances…and I explained it to him in considerabledetail.My approach was always one of cool reason. My captures were done withdeliberation and there was a certain excitement leading up to the killing, agive and take of conversation that provided a certain amusement as well asexcitement. I explained to him that it was a far more worthwhile adventure ifone would linger over the victim and enjoy the anticipation of the acts to come.He couldn’t quite understand it, since he was in such a big hurry to render thewoman dead so he could get on with the grisly sexual activities that were tofollow. I concluded that Ted was not a sadist but rather a serious ghoul.The conversations were always fascinating and I always came away learningsomething new. I doubt that Ted gave this sort of information to other inmatesbecause none of the other ones, except for Bernard Giles, had such horrifyingallegations squarely laid at their doorstep. I feel sure that Ted most likelyconfided to someone else at some time that he was a ghoul, but I have never seenany confirmation of these suspicions in print.One of the popular misconceptions about Ted is that he was a rapist/killer. Thatis untrue. Ted always killed the women first and then raped them after they weredead. Ghouls, just like everyone else, have their individual sexual preferences.Bundy was attracted to anal sex and used his victims that way first. Once againI relied on my extensive experience to help give Ted some pointers in theghouling game. It has always been my experience that women killed in the eveningseem to defecate far less than women killed in the early part of the day. Thismaxim seems to hold true time and time again, and it does eliminate one of theforemost problems that confront the ghoulish killer, and that is filth. Yes,there is a school of ghouls that do not shy away from excrement, but theseghouls are of low station and generally to be avoided.Ted returned to his personal graveyards, the areas where he kept his corpses. Hewas not particularly interested in burying the corpses, but usually left themout in the weather to rot, or at times would wrap them up in some sort ofprotective cover to keep away the carrion feeders and the maggot causinginsects. Ted knew a thing or three about maggots from direct experience, andcould match me when it came to details of corpse decomposition which I hadlearned from texts for persons interested in mortuary science and embalming.The two women that Ted killed at the state park in Washington, the ones that hetold me were the Jessup/Place copycat crimes, were done in the high summer andtherefore the rate of decomposition was much faster than victims killed in thecooler seasons. Ted tried to solve the problem of early decomposition bycarrying the corpses to a higher elevation so that they would be preserved alonger time at the cooler temperatures. Ted used these corpses sexually for aslong as he could stand it.Experiments in TerrorMy own preference was in the preliminaries and the increasing terror generatedby the woman’s awareness that she was in the hands of a homicidal maniac. I wasentranced by the varied ploys that the captive women would use in order to savetheir lives. Of course not a single one of them managed to save her life with aruse, but it always made it better when they would make the effort. Most of themwould try something, and I made it a game to see how long it would be before thevictim would request to be killed.This entertainment varied from one victim to another and it might take the formof a physical or a psychological torture. If and when the lady decided to saythat she’d had enough, I was quite willing to put her out of her misery…if sheasked nicely.You’d be surprised at how quickly this sense of resignation could be broughtabout. I picked it up from my studies of the mass executions in Poland andRussia during WWII. I had always wondered how all of those people could be linedup and shot without a fight. They seemed resigned to it. That fascinated me, soof course I had to conduct my own experiments—and I did.This sort of experiment is perfect for a person of sadistic tendencies, since wesadists do not consider our victims to be genuinely human. Ted never thought ofthe women he killed as persons but only as objects. I did the same and found itan excellent way to avoid any human feeling for them. I simply called them allmy “Kates” and let it go at that. I guess one would consider that a sociopathicquality but what the hell, we all have our faults and I am no different thananyone else in that respect.Ted, of course, was missing out on a lot of fun by simply taking his women outand bashing in their skulls so he could be about the business of taking downtheir pants without protest. I found it far more rewarding to have the woman begme for the love of God to allow her take down her own pants and give the pussyto me. It was not that the ladies found me so attractive, it was more on theorder of their finding the alternatives far less attractive.The Kate would be wondering what she had gotten herself into and by and largeshe was thinking that she was in the hands of a sex beast when that was not thesituation at all. She was, in actuality, in the hands of a homicidal maniac whohad no qualms about telling her exactly what the score was, and what she couldexpect in the hours to come. The Kates didn’t want to believe that they weregoing to die. A human enough reaction I suppose, but that would abruptly changewhen I produced a shovel from the back of the car. I would politely open thedoor for them and invite them for a little walk in the woods. The average Katemight not believe up to that point that she was being carried off to be killed,but at the sight of the shovel, or perhaps the look of deadly intent on my face,the Kate would become desperately alarmed about going into the forest or theswamp with me.There was no overt threat necessary; the threat was always implied and it wasmuch more interesting to watch the brain wheels spinning around and coming totheir own conclusions about what was happening and what, if anything, could bedone to prevent the murder from occurring. It is at times such as these thatwomen can become very clever talkers. I assured Ted that with more than 170victims to my credit, I had heard all the tales that any female could invent toprevent herself from becoming a murder statistic.There is a challenge in encouraging the lady to come along of her own accord,and I found that was best accomplished by offering her a choice. One perfectlyeffective choice might be this: I would take her breast out of her blouse andout of her brassiere if she were wearing one, and holding it firmly in my hand Iwould flick on a butane lighter and invite her to come with me quietly and ofher own free will or I would burn off her nipples. I would convince her of myintentions by lightly playing the flame over her naked bosom and allow her thefreedom to make her choice.I assure you that for the most part the ladies decided that they would prefer tosee what fate awaited them in the woods. I say “for the most part” because therewere indeed some who did make a fuss, and some who attempted a ruse or even aphysical attack. The ladies who did such foolhardy things did find themselvesdying much more onerously than their cooperative sisters.The Maggot ProblemTed appreciated the differences in our respective styles, but couldn’tunderstand my aversion for the women after they turned putrid and began to rotin earnest. He didn’t seem to mind the maggots, but I did. They were forever aproblem to be dealt with.Leaving the victim clothed after the killing helps to keep down the maggotproblem. And a plastic bag secured over the victim’s head is excellent forkeeping flies out of the facial orifices.Consider: Maggots are caused by flies and flies are attracted to stink. It isaxiomatic that any time one keeps a victim for more than three hours, the ladyis going to have to pee. In these situations usually the victim is bound andhelpless with her wrists secured behind her back. The anxiety of the situationwill cause her to want to relieve herself, and if the fear factor is enhancedthen incontinence often occurs. The stink of urine will bring the flies at once.Yes, there is the option of simply taking down the lady’s pants and letting herpee, but that option is rarely chosen. Many times the victim would tell me thatshe had to “go to the toilet.” They were always very coy about it.The proper reaction is to simply ask the victim what she expects you to do aboutit. Remember now that these women expect rape at the least, and any messingaround with their clothes can cause more of a reaction that a direct move tomurder them. The female victim seems to be a lot more confident when she has herclothing on and it has not been set in disarray or messed with.I have had such victims ask me if I would unbind them for the purpose ofallowing them to go off into the bushes alone for a pee…or whatever. Incredibleas that may sound, it has occurred. Of course, they’d get nowhere with thatrequest.Playing DoublesTed was, of course, a tyro when he nabbed Ott and Naslund; when I nabbed Jessupand Place I had been in the ghoul game for almost 10 years, so I knew what toexpect from these juicy young creatures at the end. By then I was into doingdouble murders and an occasional triple when the opportunity arose, whereas Tedat the same point of time was only able to handle singles. He was playing atcopycat and doing a poor job of it at that.Doing doubles is far more difficult than doing singles, but on the other hand italso puts one in a position to have twice as much fun. There can be some livelydiscussions about which of the victims will get to be killed first. When youhave a pair of lively teenaged bimbolinas bound hand and foot and ready for asession with the skinning knife, neither one of the little devils wants to bethe one to go first. And they don’t mind telling you quickly why their bestfriend should be the one to die.Giving the victim false hope is always fun. For instance, say you have theJessup and Place girls and you decide that one will live and one will die. Butwhich will be the lucky one? Ask them and they will tell you in great graphicdetail why each is the best of the litter for you. Sex? You cannot imagine howcompanionable such a little teenaged vixen can be until you have one at yourcomplete mercy. My, how they do ask for the privilege of doing whatever mightplease your amorous interests. Anything at all they are agreeable to.Take the Place girl, Susan. She was a heroin addict and was without any means oflegitimate income. How do you think the girl earned the money to support hernarcotics habit? Yes, with her sex; so she was indeed quite knowledgeable andskilled for a young lady of age 17. The other bimbo, Crystal as she liked tocall herself, was a veteran of the beachfront hippie pads and skilled in her ownright as well. I ask you, what does a fella do when confronted by so muchagreeable young flesh? One does the best that one can and asks questions thatwould make a Tangiers whore blush. But the young bimbos, their asses on the lineso to speak, were quick enough to answer each and every question and assure methat if they had never tried it that they would be quick to learn.I have found that professional prostitutes are the finest victims when it cometo a ghoulish murder because they understand at least to some degree what isgoing on and will even, if one is lucky, get into the spirit of the act and dotheir part to make it a stunningly fine event. There have been several hookersthat I have murdered that have simply told me straightaway that they havesuspected that their lives would end in just such a way.Hookers are interesting in that way, unusually keen at understanding why theymust die. I would compare it to the cow that is suddenly confronted by thehunting leopard and stands there rigid with fear, allowing itself to be broughtdown. Skilled hookers are often like that.This is not to infer that each and every whore is the same, they are not. Thekiller must demonstrate mastery over his victim and convince the victim that thedeath act is in her own best interest and the best interest of society. This isnot as hard as it might sound if one maintains self-discipline and personalcontrol. Ted would simply fly apart and go on this murder rampage and before heknew it there would be blood and brains and gore all over the entire area. Allquite unnecessary when one sits down and carefully lays out a plan and then putsit into effect.Private GraveyardsCorpse disposal is an essential consideration for successful long-term serialmurder. The police only become involved when they have a corpse. With a quickkill the risk of discovery is minimalized, especially if it is also a silentkill.During the late sixties I incorporated into my victim base women who sought outor offered narcotics. There were fewer remote areas to be safely used as killingplaces, but by that time I’d learned that my car made a superior death chamber.The routine was to “arrest” the doper, put her in handcuffs, wrap a length ofcord around her ankles, push a Kotex into her mouth, and tie it firmly with anAce bandage. This was followed by a plastic bag pulled down over the head andtied in place with a scarf. The victim would be dead within five to ten minutes.This method also worked well when two or three were to be killed at one time.My rockpit disposal method was initiated as a response to several bodies beingdiscovered after being dumped in remote areas. I found this annoying and vaguelythreatening. The Kates from the hanging shed were quickly out of sight beneaththe rockpit water, and once secured to the bottom would not come up. Their bonescould be further concealed by underwater burial, but this was not alwaysconvenient.I’d average maybe 50 miles a day traveling one place to another, andoccasionally had to pass up a tempting kill because there was no appropriatedisposal site.I never acted in a spontaneous manner, and since I didn’t want to miss theseopportunities, I constructed a series of corpse pits adjacent to my killingsites.These holding pits were merely dirt holes 3 feet deep with a plywood lid thatcould be covered with dirt, foliage, and other camouflage.I’d pick up my whore, make the kill, put her in the holding pit, and go about mybusiness. The kill itself never took more than 20 minutes. Later I’d return tothe pit and pick up the whore for a proper burial.South Florida had a high water table at that time, and a whore buried in ashallow grave would swell and come to the surface. Carrion animals would dig herup to feed on the decaying flesh, and the smell could invite discovery. Victimsneed to be buried deep. As a rule of thumb, mine were never buried at less thanfive feet. My private graveyards are now under the chic subdivisions and parkinglots of South Florida, and they will never be found.Murder for FunI am sure Ted, upon hearing these tales, was disappointed that he had not takenmore time to smell the fear of these pretty blossoms as he sent them to theirdoom across America. At least the ladies who fell into my hands enjoyed aninteresting death and, after all, that is something. I was never one to go aboutbashing in pretty heads, and found that to be brash and impetuous to theextreme…but then Ted paid for his lack of self-discipline in the end, didn’t he?There is no doubt in my mind that Ted Bundy was insane beyond cure. During theyears 1986 and 1987 I fed his illness. I stoked his sense of depravity andencouraged him to reveal his true nature. He did so with a flair, maintaining anattitude that even if I did have more victims, he was the Best because he had amuch more developed sense of depravity. It was true I could not top him inreality, but I could always beat him with my lively imagination. I was curiouslyprivileged to hear the litany of his madness come to life, because he believedfrom what he read about me that I was a fellow traveler along those dark andsinister paths leading to physical and spiritual destruction.Recreational murder. It’s increasing here in America as the morality of oursociety sinks deeper and deeper into a morass. But you don’t want to hear atreatise on the state of our society. You want to know more about the killing,don’t you?That’s OK, everybody seems to want to know about that part. The killingfascinates people and while they say that it is awful, those same souls arerunning to their films and magazines and books to vicariously relish the thrillsthat persons like Ted are bold enough to consummate as an act of will.What would you like to hear about most? If you’re not afraid, write and ask meyour questions, because with more than 175 victims, I am an expert in the waysof death…and what comes after death as well. Yes, the ghouling. That part. Ittruly makes no difference to me here in this hellpit of the Florida prisonsystem for two life terms.So until I hear from you, be careful. For there is an underground of murder outthere, and who can say…perhaps you have already been chosen as one of itsvictims.Ted, after all, is dead. Or is he? Seems I’m always hearing that some killer hasgone on a rampage somewhere and is slaughtering victims much like Ted did. Andso the madness continues…THE MURDER CHANNELI do not agree with the proposition that the writer of a story is into thethings that he or she writes.There is me personally and then there is me the artist with words, and when weare discussing one thing we cannot leap over a line and get into another area.To say I am a sadist because I write sadistic stories makes no sense whatsoever.It’s as nutty as saying I write murder stories, therefore I want to kill people.John D.MacDonald wrote some very raw murder scenes, but I don’t recall anyone daring toinfer that he had a mental problem; Evan Hunter does some pretty grisly stufftoo, but nobody has locked him up for it.I make an easy target because I am a prisoner and I’ve been accused of being aserial killer. People say it must all be true because this guy writes aboutmurder like he was there watching it go down…or he was doing it himself.The part I really don’t like is the attempt to tie me into child murders. Accuseme of killing mature females all you like, but sex murder of eight and nine yearold kids is beyond the pale for me. Anybody accusing me of killing someone underthe age of sixteen, I’ll take a polygraph any time. I’ve had endless problemsdue to these accusations.I am in the business of writing for the entertainment of my fans–people whoprefer bizarre topics and who have trouble finding writers who cater to theirpreferences. I have always been concerned with writing realism in my murderstories. You want to know what kind of fiction this is? It’s a new genre, asub-genre of crime-horror-fantasy. I call it Schaeferism. Who can say for surewhere it is going to lead? The whole idea is to explore new trails in the areaof literature.It bothers me that when I say that I’m writing fiction, I am disbelieved. Icould understand that–IF it weren’t for the fact that I have been studyingfiction writing for a long time, since 1963 officially. It’s not a question ofthis guy being accused of murder and then saying, gee, I’m a fiction writer, butit turns out he’d never written or studied anything. I’ve been studying the artin depth since high school;I studied creative writing in college and beyond. And after all that, I getaccused of murder and the cops steal my stuff and then come along and try tomold these crimes to fit my stories.Then suppose I’d stopped writing. Wouldn’t the cops say, he never really was awriter, he was a diarist; and after we took his diaries away and locked him up,he never wrote another word. How would that look? It so happens that I went toprison and used my skills to entertain myself and polish the style I was alreadydeveloping before I went to prison.There is no real proof to back up the allegations that I committed any crime, sowhat the State’s Attorney did was create a monster with no credibility and thething took off from there into the fictional 34 victims. The facts of the caseshow what happened, and to this day there is not one shred of evidence that Icommitted any murders anywhere.My problem has been that nobody believes I am innocent. No matter what I say ordo, that remains a constant. Since I am disbelieved, my feeling is that I mightas well use the accusations to my artistic advantage. I recognize that my lifeis wrecked and that it will be impossible for me to ever have a normal socialrelationship.Since I’m shot down in flames socially, I don’t really give a fuck what peoplethink of me personally, so long as they will just leave me alone. I am accusedof all this bizarre shit every time a bone is found in Florida. Why deny it? I’dmuch rather say, yes! I killed 175 women and here’s why!I specialize in fiction. “Bloody Instructions” is based on the fact of Ted Bundyapproaching me, and captures the gist of our conversations in prison. I haveturned those encounters into fiction, but the fiction is convincing because Idraw the details from reality.If I am writing fact, then I will simply tell you that the work is factual andleave it at that. For example, “Jesse in Flames” is something that I livedpersonally, and should be read as a non-fiction selection. I knew all the peopleinvolved in the crime, including one of the victims who was a cop when I liveddown in that same area of the state. I have personally seen quite a few men, anda few women too, walk down that corridor to the death chamber, and I have alwayscarefully studied their demeanor. In a way, I am fortunate to have been able tobe up at Florida State Prison for those 23 executions and to be able to plug myemotions into the atmosphere surrounding them, as it will be a valuable thing toincorporate into my future stories.The movies would have the public believe that all these executions are done inthe same way, and that the persons to be executed more or less cooperate withtheir own killing. Not so. Some of them are resigned to their fate and go alongquietly, but others put up quite a struggle. Tafero was one of the few whohandled it in a brave manner and did not have to be dragged to the Chair.I have experimented with a lot of different styles. When Roy Hazelwood of theFBI said I am a sadist because the stuff I write is sadistic, I took that as achallenge. I have never had a sex partner accuse me of being sadistic with her.In my opinion, none of the stories I’d written in the past had been aboutclassic sexual sadism. I can write to order, just as I have done in the pastwith my private fetish customers, and to prove it I wrote “Blonde on a Stick,”which I’d like to dedicate to Roy Hazelwood. Now he can say that I do writesadistic stories and cite “Blonde on a Stick” as the prototypical example. Imolded this story to fit the accusation levied against me.“Blonde on a Stick” is not a real event which has been fictionalized. It’s onlymake-believe. Where did it come from? Out of my anger–anger at being called asadist, at being locked up in solitary, at being treated like a piece of dogshitby “correctional officers.” I sort of “zone out” when I write this stuff, andfrom that source I produced the story. Now I cannot tell you if that zone iswithin me or from some cosmic murder channel I can plug into at will, but thatis how I am able to write so realistically.“False Confessions” is another completely imaginary story, written in the flatstyle of a reminiscence. It is merely a matter of style, and of making up thingsto fit in with the topic being addressed, which is the why and wherefore ofserial murder. “Flies in Her Eyes” explores serial murder and ghoulism–reachingfor new levels of horror and degradation.Where I live, here at Florida State Prison, people are electrocuted. That’s apolite euphemism for killing human beings. The people who work at this humanslaughterhouse are by necessity mentally and emotionally predisposed towardcruelty, violence and murder. Many are sadists. They all enjoy being a part ofthe killing in some form. Each individual plays a small part in the killing acton behalf of the State.In prison I can talk to genuinely evil people—the real life boogeymen who dounspeakable acts. I’ve chatted up authentic ghouls and serial killers, homicidalsex maniacs who come as they kill. How many writers have had the chance to talkto Ted Bundy—as a fellow convict, a peer? I took down the spoken confession ofHenry Lee Lucas’ sidekick, Ottis Toole, the Devil’s Child—the man who told mehow he raped, murdered, beheaded, barbecued and ate Adam Walsh. I enjoy hearingthe weird things people experience. It sparks my creativity and puts the stingin my stories about real-life murder fiends, deadly and twisted in ways we’d allrather not consider.I could even tell you where I got the basic factual data to fashion into fictionscenarios: One title I recall was Kogan’s Theory and Practice of Hell. Anotherone was The Roots of Evil. I also used The History of Torture. The Ghoul storiesare, of course, distinctly different in that they deal in a melange of insanityand perversion. Krafft-Ebbing was the major source on sexual perversions of thisnature. And of course Flannery O’Connor. In 1964 I read “A Good Man Is Hard toFind” and “Good Country People” and saw the Herschell Gordon Lewis movieBloodfeast. Flannery’s Misfit and Fuad Ramses were the little kernels thatgaverise to my homicidal maniac, The Ghoul.During the late sixties there were quite a few adult book shops that sold fetishnovels. The top money was in S/M, B/D and unusual fetishes. This was attractiveto me because reading such material, I could say to myself, “You can cook upsomething better than this.” I used factual accounts of real events andfictionalized them. By the seventies this sort of porn format was in decline andbeing replaced by historical treatments of fetish topics, with titles like “TheHistory of the Hang/Shit Fetish.” These works presented the topic as an academicmatter using psychological text case studies and profuse illustrations andphotos. The purpose was to beat the “redeeming social value” rule.Take sex, for example, bestiality: there are places in other societies where thefamily dog is used to clean the shitty behinds of kids. A girl grows up with adog licking her ass. In the USA we frown on that, but if one does a study of thecultural idiosyncrasies of societies where girls grow up with a dog’s tonguelapping between their legs and does it in a way that’s academically sound, itbeats the obscenity problem.I was a full time university student, full time hunting/fishing guide, part timehack writer with ideas to break into the fetish trade. It was fun to do when Ihad time, but after 1971 I never had time for writing. Once I saw my effortswere not income generative I chunked the whole mess of manuscripts, magazines,photos and all into the boxes and stuck them in a closet and forgot about thewhole thing. None of that was criminal in nature. It was not seizable under theterms of the warrant issued. But they seized it. They read it. Five weeks afterthe stuff was seized, they come up with this “Greatest Crime” crap.I’ve never tried to say I was a hotshot new talent. My basic bitch has been thatI had a right to write whatever I pleased in my own home; that the police had noright to seize it absent a warrant stating they wanted my literary work; thatthe State had no right to use it in a murder trial absent some nexus between theitem entered into evidence and the crime charged; and that newspapers andmagazines had no right to quote from my writing and to say that I write fiendishstories, and therefore I am a ghoulish, corpse-loving fiend. When the Ghoul digsup a corpse to make love to it and its toes fall off, prosecutors all over theState immediately eye the author as a villain.“Powerline Road,” “Expecting Dinner,” and “Into the Mind of the Ghoul” werewritten with intent to offend. Vomit bags should be issued with this book. But Ican’t be faulted on the detail. The Ghoul character is perfectly insane; thecondition of the bodies is perfectly accurate and if the reader isn’t shockedand chilled by the mindless horror that defies understanding, then I need toturn in my pen.Those tales cut along the edge of reveling in murder and perversion.I’m not going to say: Oh, that stuff is just twaddle and nasty and you can’tprint it. I’m not a phony. I wrote serious fucking maniac stories. I wasconcerned with making the stuff gross and nasty and crazy. I worked hard at it.It’s valid prose.And it’s non-criminal.A disturbed personality is always going to find something to lash along itsmadness. With “Into the Mind of the Ghoul” we have the first stirrings of themaniac’s tortured mind. Then in “Powerline Road” the fantasy slips into reality.The Ghoul is patently crazy in his actions but his reflections are fairly lucid.You will never know the long hours I put into the Ghoul stories. The ironic partis that what the police stole from me might be termed working drafts. “MurderPlan” is skeletal, a bare structure on which to flesh out a yarn. It annoyed methat this was published when it was not anywhere near where I wanted it to be.“Powerline Road” and “Expecting Dinner” were much further along, but dealt withthe implementation of the insane compulsions manifested through sex andviolence. It’s the old case of the intellect presenting the problem to the willand the will says, let’s run with it or let’s drop it. But the Ghoul is all fullof short circuits in his psyche. He goes directly from ghouling around toluncheon on the corpse’s money. Instead of losing his lunch, he buys his lunch.Because, of course, he is out to lunch!If I didn’t have the emotional capacity to chuckle at all this I’d have beentotally a basket case by now. I just roll with it. Mass murderer! You bet. Bestin the business…and let me tell you how it’s done.My stories have been well researched for realism: I have watched people die fromgunshot and stabbings and various other means when I worked Emergency RoomSecurity at Broward Medical Center. I’ve seen people hanged (suicides), smashedin car wrecks, having heart attacks, blasted by shotgun.The research about how people rot was taken from mortician texts and homicideinvestigation texts. The mortuary science texts are particularly good, becausethey go into the chemistry of putrefaction. You get an hour-by-hour discourse onhow a corpse decays into a puddle of slime. I used that textbook material forthe part about the girl in the canal and the disinterment of the girl in thehole. The toes rotting off. Classic touch.If you want to be a good horror writer you need to have a command of thesethings. You can’t just sit down one day and write a convincing horror talewithout doing some exhaustive research, and I’m sure Stephen King will tell youthe same thing. Squash the baby, flatten the cat, hang the whore and watch herrot.The Ghoul is a negative character—the reader is supposed to hate him and fearhim. He represents the blackest depths of the human heart that is twisted beyondcomprehension or redemption. There is a queer chilling power that runs through“Expecting Dinner.” I’m not talking great writing. I’m talking rawfiendishness—here’s a sexual psychopathic monster that will scare the wits outof you. The prose is actually drab; the emotion, the madness, the perversionooze through it like a bloody slime. The purpose is to wallow in the insanity ofthe character, his homicidal delusions and sexual dysfunction. The Ghoul isponderously sick throughout his entire being, and the prose reflects that drab,morbid hopelessness.The Ghoul stories raise gooseflesh—not because of the clever prose, but becauseof attention to the horrible little details. Don’t you love the way I have themaniac feeling sorry for his victims? What a twisted fucker he is! Ted Bundy inthe Chi-0 house with his club evokes terror, but my character evokes horror viahis base depravity, incomprehensible vileness.The melange of perverted psyches I used to shape my Ghoul character, while basedon the Misfit, are a cross-breeding of various types. Frelied heavily on threeespecially Ghoulish true cases: Sergeant Bertrand in Paris, Ed Gein and BelaKiss.These three were corpse-fuckers. Fish was also a corpse-eater. The confusion andremorse I based on the Heirens case. He was the original Catch-Me Killer, whowould sneak in and steal women’s clothes. It was an escalation of perversionsthat ended up with Heirens becoming a serial killer. Bela Kiss had over 20 womenin his drums. Pickled in alcohol. Bundy visited the rotting corpses of the womenhe killed. He liked to tart them up with fresh makeup and nail polish. That’sghoulism.Gives you the involuntary shivers—if you can let yourself think about it.The fascination with hanging is perversion more than crime, but well documentedin older psychological case books. Mainly it was that the person was “imprinted”sexually by the spectacle of public hangings, and the vision became amasturbation fantasy. Then he got “locked into” the fantasy and it blockedregular sex. There’s no limit to the weirdness you run into in these books onabnormal sex imprintings, so I dumped all this in a pot, and stirred up a realding-dong of a homicidal maniac.Insanity is hard to capture on paper. There has to be a throb as the mind jumpsoff the trolley of rationality into the abyss of madness. In many of my storiesI weave murder into sex as a social perversion. I do murder as an expression ofinsanity, rage, and power. But I don’t do murder as a mystery in the classicalsense. There is no “whodunit” aspect, rather the focus is on the “whydoit.” Idwell on the rapacious destruction of beauty, a feature of murder that angerspeople. I gnaw away at areas where other writers are too timid to venture.Murder, as I write it, is not a rational act. In “Cut Bait,” the theme ishomicidal insanity; it’s a horror story. It’s not supposed to make sense, but itdoes make your skin crawl. I’m not going to tell you if it’s a true story ornot. I’d prefer to see you sweat.I focus on realism, so my Ghoul looks like a regular fella. I stole this conceptright out of the Bible. It says the Devil can appear as an Angel of Light. Thatis to say, he can fool you because you cannot recognize him. In my stories, younever can recognize the monster until he nails you. “Spring Break” is theperfect example. It’s a horror story, only the monster does not come up out ofthe Intracoastal waterway to grab the girl. He’s a human monster—the sort ofmonster Vincent Price portrayed in Conqueror Worm and other Poe classics, andHitchcock dealt with in Psycho. Normal people cannot understand a Norman Bates.He’s, well…psycho.My character is scary because he is ordinary, but he is living in a dimension ofinsanity that causes the reader to gasp in revulsion. Squashing a kid with atruck is gross, but it happens every day in real life. A homicidal sex pervertsticking his toes up a dead girl’s squishy cunt is riding a line of madness thatteeters on sick humor. It’s frightening but it can be funny as well.“It’s downbeat, it’s crawling out from under a wet rock and leaving a slimytrail…it’s…the Ghoul!”That work was done 20+ years ago, and since then I’ve progressed as a writerinto other areas. I’m still good for a few more rounds with the Ghoul, though:Trick Baby Meets the Ghoul, The Ghoul and the Hitchhiker, Slice of Life/Slice ofDeath, Lavender Lips, Bagged by the Ghoul. (“Her mouth was open. A lavender huewas on her lips, pink flecks of lipstick clung to the visible gray tongue. Iwondered if I would catch some weird disease if I kissed the pretty corpse. Idecided to find out and removed the transparent plastic Kleen Cleaners bag fromher head.”)If you read it superficially you get a turn-off because of the nastiness. But ifyou sit down and really read it, there is the underlying vibrancy of insanity.You’d like to dismiss these stories, call them jack-off fantasies for perverts.Then upon reflection, you think this could be real! That’s what is really scary.But I really cannot see where anyone would even remotely consider this stuffindicative of a criminal mentality. It’s not even worth a XXX rating as it’swritten. I anyone had read the stories, and asked me, “Hey, what’s all thismean, Jellybean?”—which nobody did, not even my defense lawyer—I could have readily explained itall.I once got thirty days in the Hole for submitting a story to a magazine. Theeditor was so upset he wrote to the prison demanding I be punished. I was too!Talk about hot stuff! It was a biker’s testimonial. Red hot smoking gospel fromthe mouth of a Scooter Tramp turned to Jesus. I wrote it as he told it. Dope,murder, sex perversion. All of it. I wrote my story true and for that I got theBox. Compliments of an editor who didn’t like it. Everybody likes murder tales,but nobody likes the maggots up the nose part. Well, I’d like to let the folksknow that murder ain’t nice.I’ve had prison officials scream in my face that I’m a sick pervert for sendingout my stories. Bad for the self-esteem. But inside, deep down in the artist’ssoul of me, the applause was ringing and the announcer was saying “Let’s have ahand for the master fictionalist who put an adult state official into ascreaming fit over a story!”Killer Fiction creates a small wound in the area of the brain where socialawareness is housed. It’s a social indictment in the guise of entertainment.Anyone who says, “This is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever read” is paying mea compliment. I like superlatives, like most disgusting. What people hate aboutmy stuff is the confrontation with their own mortality. These stories aredesigned to make you throw up and leave you looking over your shoulder for along while. As for those timid souls who read my work and hate it: Good! Myintent is to get a valid emotional response.The “Starke Stories” slam the system that degrades people in the name ofcorrections. People think prisons are country clubs. These stories just give ahint of what it’s really like. I portray the sick, perverted individuals whostaff them and populate them. “Early Release” is just a beginning.“Nigger Jack” rolls into forbidden territory, but it’s very accurate. Thevalidity of the execution scene goes to the basic truth of the event. Do womenreally bleed when they are electrocuted? Do their guts really burst? (Yes.) Nowwe are dealing with a fact that people would rather not be confronted with. Thecracker mentality, the casual racism—I’m a real authority on prison racism—theseare important to the realism. But the main focus is on the sexual overtones thataccompany female executions in prisons for men.I do not write these stories to degrade the reader. Gratuitous grossness is notintended, but I do strive to offend your social consciousness to the point whereyou say, “I refuse to allow these executions to be done in my name—I am ThePeople!”“My Ticket” is a satire on how I ribbed Bundy; “Death House Screams” is aboutthe 1979 Spenkelink execution, and how the State violated Spink’s body bypacking him. “Brutality” is a matter of opinion, and the FSP Administration doestry to make executions suitable for mixed company.I am not deluded. I’ve never said, Gee, I’m the new Papa Hemingway, I’m abudding Norman Mailer, Elmore Leonard, whatever. I’m not. I’m just G.J.Schaefer, Storyteller, Dabbler in the Art of Prose, and I enjoy lifting up therocks scattered over the meadow of our society and watching the creepy-crawlersin human skins scuttle hither and thither. I don’t have to live with anyone butmyself—and I like myself just fine. I’m a recalcitrant bastard and I’m crazierthan a shithouse rat—but not so one would notice.I make decisions. They aren’t always right decisions, but nobody runs aroundcalling me wishy-washy. More like manipulative: An ex-cop survives in prison bybeing the slyest, motherfuckingest, most expert manipulator he can be. Bet yerass I’m a manipulator, and mean, and stubborn…but also above-averagely honest,loyal to a fault and true to my convictions. And I work like a fiend.I have this ability—a gift or a curse or whatever—and I’m in a dilemma as towhether to run from it or continue to explore it. I enjoy writing and thecontroversy of being way out there where nobody else dares to go. It appeals tomy innate sense of adventure. Now how do I get these critics off my back? Stopwriting? Or continue to write and polish my skills?I am inclined to quit writing this sort of stuff. I’m thinking about writingabout the saints. I was always enthralled by pictures of those kiddies about tobe gobbled up by lions and tigers and then, later, nubile young Christiansdangling from crosses or about to undergo all manner of horrible torture for thesake of their faith. It almost seemed as if it might be fun to be a martyr.image [Images/248.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"KILLER FACTLetters from GJ Schaeler to Sondra London19893/15/89.

Your society does not understand that anymore…If you betray my trust Ican, if I choose, have you and your kid dead at the bottom of the Chattahoocheeriver within 30 days. Such matters take longer when I can’t get near a phone.…My sister was raped. The rapist was dealt with. A man threatened my stepmother.He spent 4 days bound & gagged in a closet and his house was robbed of everything in it. I don’t fuck around. Mess with my family and you get hurt. 3/21/89. I am, at this time, enmeshed in a world of boundless evil. I am,factually, a captain in the Dixie Mafia; (I joke about it but it’s not really afunny matter)…I have, factually, the power to have you killed. I have, in thepast, used these powers.Now. If you betray me or the people I am associated with to the police or if youfail to keep your word with respect to our Project—and I’ve explained it to youso you know, we’ve agreed—you shall be put to death in accordance with thetraditions of the Underworld. If you are interested in the exact formalities ofhow such matters are concluded I’ll be glad to explain to you. So.

Acertain Crime Boss sent a person to him one day with a check for $12,500 to payoff the debt and he was told verbally. This is a gift. It need not be paid back.My dad was shocked to his soul. He kept after me, I got to pay the money back.People don’t give away $12,500 to an old man!!! Oh, but they do, Dad. In myworld. My mom receives a check every month for several hundred dollars tosupplement her retirement. Compliments of the Syndicate. She’s the mother of asub-chief.

Believe it or not it’s as easy as pie to avoidthe draft. Just slip on a pair of panties, wear a garter belt & nylons andvoila! Instant 1-Y classification. Really, you only need to tell the people atArmy induction center you are ‘queer’ & that’s sufficient. I was drafted. I gotdown to the point to be sworn in and in my best thespian manner asked if it wasgonna be OK to be in the Army if I’m queer? There’s maybe a hundred guys there,all macho posturing and I come out with I’m a queer. Fastest dismissal you everdid see. Oh, they interrogate you a bit but the key is to be sincere. They arelooking for the phony faggot, limp wrist type; so you just play the straightman…‘Of course I want to be in the Army, I just wondered if there was any rulesagainst wearing panties.’ Believe me, they throw you right out the door.I played the role to a tee. I never hid my ‘perversion.’ Wore my nylons right toclass…I’m laughing up my sleeve & wearing a garter girdle and never considerVietnam as an impediment to my academic career. Same with the photos. Bond-ageritual! Oh my God! Major League freak action. I never hid them. I was very openabout it. It was simply a case of doing the necessary to get what I wanted:My University Education…If I’m a pervert because I wore garter belt & nylons to class then I’m apervert.I just don’t happen to give a rat fuck whether I’m regarded as a pervert or not…I did not have sex problems. A problem means you are unhappy, discontented.My sexual orientation is 100% heterosexual…My Felice requires domination by aman because she was taught sex was sinful. She has very low self-esteem in thearea of sex due to guilt. She needs to feel helpless before a man’s force…shehas a ex problem. I understand it and am helping her cure it…I certainly do notregard myself as deviant. I’m sure Boy George laughs all he way to the bank, asdoes Alice Cooper. I’m as valid an entertainer as either of them…Jessica Zurriaga: I invented her years ago. Ran ads under her name. Made a buck.I wrote as a woman. Had about 500 ‘slaves’ & submissives answer. You train theslave to wash out your panties and return them with $10. I had a lady handlingthe mail for me. The slave sends the lingerie. The lady wears it, gets it nice &nasty, mails it to the slave for cleaning. I’d write the letters…You can get apretty good extra income from closet slaves who don’t want to meet you. I usedto purchase my photos…Tell the slave. Send $5.00 to see my naked tits. Moneyrolled in…Time & postage. Shit, I’ve got time! [Smiley Face]…True story: So I’m Mistress Zurriaga writing the freaks. The prison censorspick up on it. Confiscate my mail. Give it to the psychologist. They stick me insex education! I go see the shrink; I say, T run a fucking slave empire!’ Theguy is entranced, he cannot believe I’m pulling it off. I convinced him. No moresex education class. I became the joke of the prison but I’m laughing becauseguys pay to wash the shitty panties of my bitch. Big Pervert. Sure, but I’mraking in the coin. Ain’t I?…Dear Felice,Your letter of March 13 is in hand and I’m in Atlanta, in Georgia; here in the4th floor suite which is a nice change from my stuffy office. As you mightexpect I’m very bored with the celebrity lifestyle. The secretaries are reallyquite whorish wearing mini skirts, shamelessly displaying themselves in hope ofcatching the eye of the new media Star. I really prefer a woman who enjoys thequiet home life like yourself. Having lunch with Paul Newman was pleasant. Doyou ever see his films?Oh, I do not mind your questions about the whores. How can you please me unlessyou know their techniques? You are well aware I do not tolerate femalefoolishness. You confessed to me already you are guilty of oral sodomy. A manlicked your cunt. You allowed him to do it. Didn’t you? Did you ask him to bekind and spare you such a degrading act? No! You laid on your back with yourlegs spread and your hole open and enjoyed it. I tolerate no lies from a woman.I’ll take the strap to you for a lie. So what you are, Felice, is a man’s fuckslut. This is not to say you are a bad girl but unfortunately you did engage insexual perversions, serious crimes that would put you in prison in some States.I know young girls make mistakes in life and I don’t hold that sin of sexperversion against you and you know very well that few men would ever accept awoman who’s committed willful sodomy; so you ought to be on your knees thankingGod I can overlook it. Isn’t that right, little Bitch? I’m always truthful aboutit.You do have some favorable points. You are willing to try to please me. I knowyou will please me well because if you do not you shall receive a goodstrapping. Yes, I’ve given the strap a lot of thought and while you DO have agood heart and your obedience level is high, there is a little thread ofinsolence that needs to be removed. I’m very good at detecting such insolence ina woman. When I tell you to suck on my penis the only thing I want to hear onyour lips are spit bubbles bursting as you mouth my pole. Yes, I’m quiteobservant of female insolence, you already know that.I’ve spent a lot of time on you. Certainly more than you deserve. I’ve done thatto train you to be perfect. I have no doubt you shall be perfect. The day isapproaching when you shall be called to my side and from the minute you arrive Iexpect instant, unquestioned, perfect obedience. I assure you that in public youwill receive every courtesy due your status and in the bedroom you shall, underpain of the lash, perform better than a whorehouse fuck-bitch. The leatheracross your fat ass will put a stop on those thoughts of sin. Feli will fucklike a whore or be whipped soundly. I have spoken on the matter. Do you dare toquestion me?I’m very pleased we are in agreement in this area. I want my Bitch trainedquickly and completely in obedience. It’s a man’s right, and a woman’s duty tosubmit to obedience. I certainly do not expect to have to use the strap but, ifwe need it it’ll be there for you! A successful woman is well disciplined by herman. I know you agree on that!! [Smiley face]Tomorrow I’m going to examine a set of cunt rings. If I like them I’ll get youthe set. You wear them like earrings only on your cunny lips. Very nice. 22Kgold. Here’s a little sketch how it looks. You hook the rings on the labia. Aribbon is drawn through the rings and tied closed. 3 rings on each labia. A tidylittle bow at the top on a symbolic chastity belt. The rings will look very chicwhen the cunt is shaved. Have you ever worn cunt rings before? Many whores wearthem. Very decorative with crotchless panties. A bit expensive. Almost $900 forthe set but worth it if you are excellent on the bed. How do you like my idea?Now, my groveling little slut, I have a meeting to attend. I’ll be lunching withSondra London from Hollywood, the TV actress. If you are a good girl and asknicely I’ll tell you about it in the next mail. You are as lazy & useless asever and I can’t believe a girl with a 38” butt doesn’t wear a girdle. It’s verysluttish, you need discipline and you shall receive it.Prepare yourself for a life of Service & Obedience because I will see you soon.Faithfully & Loyally Your Love, Gerry3/24/89.

One is written as aBondage Mistress, the other as a working hooker. Mistress Helga is a realperson, Mistress Felice is me. [Smiley Face]…Once again, I’m writing these toshow you that I have the skill to deal creatively with sexual deviants of bothgenders and I am not in any manner sexually dysfunctional or unable to talkabout sexual topics.My only sex problem is a lack of pussy. “Sex killers” are usually unable tocarry on routine heterosexual relationships. I not only carry on routine onesbut every imaginable sort of deviant ones as well.Hi Nickie Dear,I’m down here in Atlanta for a few weeks. I was asked to give a small class onSlave Management & Training to prostitutes associated with COYOTE. Quite a fewhookers are going into the area because it’s sort of ‘safe sex’ so I was inviteddown as a ‘Consultant’ to speak on the topic. The money is good, the parties arefun, but I prefer my own slaves…have you been thinking of my cunt? I do hope so!I’ve been waiting to hear how you want to begin your servitude. Yesterday I wasdemonstrating one of your favorite topics: Enema Bondage. The slaves were a realdisappointment. No sexual discipline at all. None. I used the Chinese Enemastyle. The slave being hooded and hanged by his heels. There were three of themhanging there hoisted aloft by a pair of dykes. I gave the ladies the enemapreparation instructions verbally so the slaves could worry, and to speed thingsup I used a full strength caustic enema, very warm water and detergent. Thefirst slave, a young man about 20, climaxed the moment he felt the bulb againsthis anus; the second slave, maybe 25, he took about an inch of nozzle andsquirted jizz all over the place; the third slave (35 to 40) took the entirenozzle but his erection was throbbing so I demonstrated a new technique of fastwithdrawal of the nozzle and the slave came. I can tell you, Nickie, those werethe sorriest enema slaves I ever did see. The hookers were all delighted sincethey get paid when the man climaxes. My own feelings on it was that the men werecheated of full orgasm since the climax should coincide with the expulsion ofthe enema. It’s the same problem I see when prostitutes administer the lash.I’ve watched several slaves whipped down here. Within 5 to 10 strokes the man ispumping cum. Properly performed the ritual calls for 39 strokes of the lashplus: the 40th stroke laid on precisely to induce orgasm.The only woman down here who seems to know her business is Mistress Helga. Iwent out to her place in Chamblee and saw her use an 11 -foot bull’s pizzle whipon a slave. Hung him up by his wrists naked. Stripped herself down her garterbelt & black silk stockings, shook out the whip and let fly. The first snap madehim shit like a cow, the second snap put him into orgasm, the third snap knockedhim out cold. I was very impressed even though Helga was just showing off. I’mnot that skilled with the bull’s pizzle whip. I do best with the whip we callthe ‘cat’ but most of the whipping is with the big leather strap called a RedHannah. Do you have a preference? I’m going to have to put you to the strapeventually. Are you ready for it?Tomorrow I’m being fitted for a new costume: Georgia State Prison ExecutionMatron. Wait until you see me in this outfit. Black tight skirt & blouse withsilver piping. Black patent leather boots and belt and, best of all, a blackcowl with a mask!! When a murderess is put in the electric chair these uniformedmatrons strap her in and hook her up. My slaves will love this fantasticuniform. What uniform do you prefer for our initial meeting?You can write to me at the business office. I check for mail every day.Depending on what you prefer maybe I’ll work you in on my way back north. Mycunt needs your tongue.Mistress FeliceDearest Hank,I flew down to Florida for the Slims and the Lipton. You’d have absolutely gonecrazy seeing me in my little tennis skirt without panties. I was kept very busybut I did watch Steffi Graf and Chris Evert in the final match. I had a goodtime and made a lot of money. Now I’m in Atlanta working some businessconventions. It’s the next best thing to a money tree.I’m such an awful bitch to you but surely you understand that a girl needs tomake her money when she’s young? I’ll be working Atlanta…Then I have a job inWharton, NJ. Is that close to you? If so, maybe we can spend some time together?What I had in mind was just some fun. Fix you up in drag and we can shop and eatout and ‘be girls together’ since I know you’d really like that. Wouldn’t you? Ithink you’d be able to pass for female if I were there to watch out for you andguide you along. I wouldn’t charge you unless you want to have sex. That’s fairisn’t it? Wouldn’t it be funny if we were together and you got an erection whilewearing a dress? We’d need to tape down your cock to be on the safe side. You’dhave to use the women’s restrooms. How do you feel about that? You’d be OK.There are stalls to go into. Nicely private. Just remember to sit down to pee!…Would you like to smell my panties after I’ve been sitting in them all day? Areyou SERIOUS about wanting to be my sex slave? I’m really thinking I could go forit.Write me your best effort on how you’d make love to my cunt. Convince me youreally can make me squeal with pleasure. I also want some photos of you in dragso I can see what I need to do to help feminize you, and some photos of you nudewith cock erect. Best effort. If I like what I hear and see I’ll stop by aftermy job in Wharton.Please assure me you are not troubled by my being a prostitute. Men only want mefor 1 thing—I’m used to that. How can you love me slut that I am?Write soon! Your Favorite Hooker, Felice3/29/89. Along with all the other unpleasant things you’re learning you’re gonnaneed to learn about children being sold and child porn and prostitution. Thefirst three photos are of little girls available for purchase. Age 8 to 14 isthe preferred age, but 14 is a bit long in the tooth. The recruits are, ofcourse, scrawny. These are raw material of the trade and these 3 photos showcallow hopefuls. The procuress is off to the right. Low rent area.The second photo shows girls in a working stable. (1983) On the reverse is theirnames and note Eric (Cross, Mervyn) and Tanie (Arbaquez) and the query about the‘new found lost souls.’ It’s an inquiry as to whether or not to put them towork. The one called ‘Venus’ is a regular, I’ve seen her in action. You’ll notethese girls are fed. I’ll be sending more such items, including the entireworking string of children, older girls who do sex work, individual whores. 3/30/89. Some years ago a lady journalist contacted me with the ‘let me tellyour side’ proposition. I gave her a rather long initial interview and thenlater on I found out that she made a transcription of the interview and took itto a certain police chief. She now lives in Washington State. She’s a free lancewriter, you might even recognize her name. One of her rewards for this trick shepulled on me was that her police chief pal got his judge pal to fix her up witha false commitment order to a penitentiary for women. The old Florida Women’sPrison before the one at Broward…I’m telling you this story so you know I’ve hadsome bad experiences with ‘journalists’ using the same approach you’ve made:‘I’ll tell it Fair.’ 4/7/89. Now, as for business, and this is for your information only, as I see itthere are two ways to write the book: Should I prevail in Court, the book tellsthe tale of a cop victimized by corrupt officials. Should I ultimately lose inCourt then the book takes a different slant. I’ve not yet worked out withexactitude how it will go but my general theme would be the rendition of the 34murders known and x-number unknown. I would capitalize on my famous billinggiven freely by Mr. Stone. I would earn money, which would be my way ofinsulting the Establishment. I’d have no problem giving you “34 victims.”My preference is for truth but since I’m the victim of a lie and my life is veryunpleasant if it is to remain that way until 2016, I’m gonna at least diefamous—or infamous—as the case may be. Famous for coming back from the pit ofhell that is FSP and turning the table over on Stone/Schwarz, or infamous as theperson Ted Bundy sought to emulate as a killer of women. Unlike Ted, I willplead guilty to all 34 after the book is written. [Smiley Face] Truth will havenothing to do with it whatsoever. If I have to be a mass murderer I’m gonna bethe #1 just like Stoney Baby said in 1973. 4/12/89. The enclosed prospective letter: Fantasy 34-L-#l, shows you I’mentirely sincere in my revenge against Stone and the “State.” The procedurewould be to verify police or official interest in clearing up an old case. Thiscase just so happens to be one in which I am already a suspect so it’s a goodone to start on. Once you establish official interest—as opposed to them saying‘those women turned up alive in New York in 1968’—the next step would be toobtain some newspaper accounts of the case. Working off those clippings I couldeasily fill in the blanks with a good sex/murder tale about how “I” killed them.Do it up as a “How To” Non-fiction Guide to Serial Murder by the Best in theBusiness.…If my Habeas is rejected I want to be able to make literary headlines:“International Sex Killer Reveals All.” AIL The ‘special pleasures’ of corpsefucking, how to make a girlie scream and scream and scream—into her gag—likewhen you light their pubic hair on fire with a butane lighter; [Smiley Face] towarm up the pussy on a cold fish type who don’t want to fuck; the way they getwhile they watch you dig their grave. All that nice unwholesome stuff…So let’s start on this Nancy case…and be forewarned, I don’t intend to stop at34. 34 are known. Remember, I had a boat. An ocean-going boat; and I know how togut a girl so she doesn’t float to the surface…Fantasy 34 Letter #1Dear Sir,I am a Media Writer in Atlanta, GA.During a recent interview with a certain person I was told about the murders oftwo young women which may have occurred about 25 years ago in your area.According to my Source he forced the two women into his car, drove them away,sexually abused them and killed them. He said he doubts anyone has ever foundthem so they may be listed as Missing Persons. This may have occurred around1963-64. The area was Ocala National Forest near a town called AltamonteSprings, he says.It was a long time ago, but he claims one of the women said her name was Nancy.What I found interesting was that the person is willing to plead guilty to thetwo murders but has kept quiet because he fears the electric chair.My purpose in writing this letter is to verify if possible that such a potentialcrime did take place around your area many years ago and, if so, could theperson who did the crime plead guilty in exchange for a sentence less thandeath? If such a possibility exists I will pass the information on to the lawyerrepresenting the Source. Please respond promptly in writing and please do notask me to become further involved or give a statement as it would be contrary tomy privilege as a Journalist.Sincerely, S.L.P.S. Would there be a reward for the person who obtained the information leadingto the conviction of the alleged killer?4/12/89. If truth is not to prevail then I’m going to turn over the applecart inanother way. I’ll make their fantasies become realities. I’ll sit down and writeup the deaths of 34 women and you can put the May 13, 1973 headlines on the dustjacket. Let’s see anyone argue with that as a gambit. I’ll spend my life inprison but I’ll live as best I’m able…I’m a realist. I’m practical, and I’mdangerous because I DON’T GIVE A FUCK... I’ll plead guilty to every murder theycome up with. That’ll be my revenge…Fuck em. When I gut a slut she doesn’t cometo the surface like Jack Murphy’s do. People already believe I’m a massmurderer. All I need to do is say: “Yeah, I am, and here’s how it went down…”Either way you get a big fat profitable story to tell. [Smiley Face]If I’m gonna do life for 2 murders I may as well do life for 42. Life is life. Ireally don’t care. 4/16/89. There is a part of me that does not want this experience perpetuated ina negative sense as a book about “How to Commit Mass Murder” (by the One whoDoes it Best) but I also realize I am stuck with a certain persona bestowed onme by Stone and pals and I can claim that I was believed to be the #1 SerialKiller, and present the “6 Dead 28 May Be” story as my license to exploit thesituation financially. I’m angry enough inside to do that…but I’m also astuteenough to see that it can be proven in Court that I am framed…so I’m willing towait. But if the State insists on running with the lie then I’m excused from anyadherence to the Truth. I mean, we are not gonna play with separate rule booksand if the book they choose is the Book of Lies then I’ll feel perfectlycomfortable with the rules of the game and I’ll give them a “true account” ofsuch mindless bloody horror that the reader will shrivel up with revulsion. Soyou say I killed Peggy & Wendy? OK. Fine. Now let’s talk about how they died.It’s like Stone telling people I murdered Place & Jessup by hanging them fromthat tree limb. Total fucking bullshit. His fantasy, if you please. But I’ll rubhis nose in it—maybe—write up a nice story about chopping the head off the onegirl while the other was tied up and watching.I’ll come up with something real horrible, bet that. 4/19/89. People are forever thinking I can’t carry on a solid heterosexualrelationship with women. Murder is the antithesis of fucking. Certainly I’m asex maniac, just ask Elton Schwarz’s wife if I’m not. What I don’t understand iswhy everyone keeps trying to make a correlation between my sexual activities andmurder. With Ted, murder was a part of his foreplay. It qualifies as ‘roughsex,’ I’d say, and he lacked sensitivity concerning the girl’s feelings but inhis case the sex was conducted after the murder. Ted must have had a certainamount of tender feeling for his lovers since he admittedly returned to themtime and time again to tidy them up and spend quiet time with them while theyrotted before his eyes. I admit his sexual tastes were bizarre; far more so thanmine. By comparison, my lovers were generally content and are even asking for myattentions to this day.So while I am complimented to be known as the greatest sex maniac of alltime—move over, Don Juan—I am annoyed by all this murder talk. Peggy & Wendyjust happened along at a time I was curious about Mr. Fish’s craving for theflesh of young girls. Fish was one of those fellas who’d say, Try it. You’lllike it!’ and along comes two little Grace Budd types—young and tender—andsolicit a ride. I assure you those girls were not molested sexually. I found theboth of them very satisfactory, particularly with sautéed onions and peppers.Should it be in the cards, I’d be glad to do up a nice cookbook. It’s mostly aMulligan Stew affair when one is on the road, although I was particularly fondof flank steaking them. I always had campers drift over to try my fare. Passedit off as wild game for the most part. Once a girl gets over 25 she’s a bittough and stringy. Hippie girl hikers, lean and mean not tender like Peggy &Wendy, but one cannot constantly grab kids off the street in the same area, so Ihad to be on the road a lot. Me and my big black frying pan. You learn that it’slargely a matter of catch as catch can in such situations.As you might expect the girl usually perceives the situation as a sort of sexperversion/rape in the making. Put a gun to her head and she is agreeable enoughto be tied and led into the woods without a problem. By the time she’s hangingby her heels from the killing tree, it’s far to late for any resistance.Contrary to popular thought, hanging a girl by her heels does not cause her tolose consciousness.I’ve carried on entirely normal conversations with upside-down girls. Naturallythey are curious as to what I’m up to. They never for a moment consider they areto be butchered for meat.The slaughter is anti-climatic. A razor-sharp knife drawn quickly across thethroat; cleave through the vertebrae and the head is severed. 3 seconds; 10seconds at most. Set the head down on the ground and you can watch the eyesblink. I’ve chatted up the heads. They can hear fine, and answer by blinking theeyes.The heads stay alert several minutes, quite interesting really but not sexy.The trick to this is to regard the girl as an animal. A dear lamb even. Noreason to be cruel to her; after all the motive is culinary, not sadistic orsexual. Look at her in terms of a piece of meat, but not in the usualconnotation that implies. Nobody gets unduly annoyed when Lykes Bros, butchermeat. As a society we are conditioned to eat beef but some other societies arekeen to enjoy a nice human stew. It’s a matter of taste, really, but I would nomore have sex with such a girl than I would with a sow. The “murder” is detachedfrom the realm of “sex.” I suppose there are weirdos who might find it “sexy” tohave some nude girl suspended upside down from a limb but if one is confrontedwith the situation one sees it in a different light.The Place/Jessup scene was such a perverted mess I’m truly offended to beaccused of it. Butchering is skillfully done, almost an art and if one isworking on a pair of sows it’s double the chore. I was always a good provider inthe meat department; ask Teresa. I even enjoyed cooking the special cuts Ibrought home…Now, such cruel accusations to endure.Well—is it a salable product? Nice touch of horror about the eyes, huh?Needs work, sure, but I think I could manage to put something together there.Those magazine stories have really caused me untold problems. I don’t supposeyou could ever understand how something like this can upset a person. You noticethat no police or dee-fense lawyers are pointing out the impossibility of myhaving murdered Briscolina/Farmer on the 25th of October 72 when I was in SouthDakota. It’s enough to make a man bitter, angry, and vengeful…but if I’m gonnaget stuck with it forever I’m gonna do it up right! [Smiley face] 4/24/89. OK. As things stand at the moment, we’re in a transitional period. Ifthe “Powers that be” do not let me go then we can present the stories as truestories. You can write a forward to the effect that I’m convicted of 2;suspected of 32 others and due to the SOS law I can’t write about the 2 (but youcan [Smiley face]) but here are the other 32…which is why I told you to checkthe 1963-73 Ft. Lauderdale papers for unsolved murders…and why I sent you thelaws governing public records. You get the police reports, I’ll taper thestories to the reports. Research takes time but it’d be worth it $-wise if I’mnot gonna get out. Of course if I am vindicated you still get a good talebecause it shows the danger of writing realistic prose and then becoming thefocus of a murder investigation. The stories are still good fiction, only Idon’t say they are based on fact. 4/27/89. Now: I see from the material you are amassing that lists exist of‘victims.’ As you go along and see a victim by name or jurisdiction pop it intoyour data bank. Then write a letter to the police agency and get a copy of thecrime report: Missing Person or Murder. Your slant should be that you are doinga book and want possible GJS victims. Send a copy of the “Greatest Crime of theCentury” cover along so they know you are onto the Biggie. The purpose is dual:1) We want an accurate portrayal of the initial accusations by Stone. Theenormity of it all. Murders all over the fucking world.With the cops your slant should be that you are accurately exposing the fiend soneed some proper detail. Any links. (And of course you will try to get the fiendto incriminate himself when confronted with his dastardly deeds) For instance:Leigh Hainline: You do a short history of L.H., run her photo(s), link to me,give a nice accurate picture of who she was and what she was. Each victim getsthis treatment. Mary Briscolina: You go into all that and at the end you say:One problem here gentle reader, GJS was in S.D. when this victim disappeared.Fact.But let everyone have their say. Of course if I don’t get out I’ll be glad toconfirm that Mary Alice was a lovely girl, she sucked cock like a wet dream; sonicely in fact that I let her decide whether she or Elsie Lina should bestrangled first. She let Elsie go first; then made a good act of contrition(cocksucking is a sin for Catholic girls) and then took her medicine like alittle dick-eating fuck slut—wiggling and squirming and peeing all over thefront seat of my car while I was trying to knot a stocking around herneck…[Smiley face] Either way we win. The second part is we just forget the factthat I was 2,000 miles away at the time. Nobody will care. Believe me. ThePeople want a ghoul. But one safely locked away. Like Ted.Anyway—you need to get busy on that too. [Smiley face] Such research takes time,but cops are real helpful if they think you are gonna bust the fiend/killer.Once you get your own list, based on the material you have already, then I’llgive you areas I traveled in and approximate times so you can write and askabout corpses discovered around that time in those areas. The ‘Buzz Number’ was34. I’d like to be able to match that. Crowder had one, a Jane Doe, he tried topin on me: Loop Road Jane Doe. You can get the paper on that one. She was bones,but that leaves a lot of latitude in making up a nice ‘confession.’ There wasalso a corpse down on Singer Island. A young girl. Palm Beach County. Just overthe line from Martin County.You can get the paper on Singer Island Girl from your pals, I suppose.You’ll want to run a few pages of “Photos of Mutilated Women” from my personalcollection. Mark them: Known Schaefer Victims. Then pick up some oldmurder/suicide victim pictures from the M.E.’s office. Unsolved cases. Caption:Another Schaefer Victim? Authorities Believe… That should get the flamescrackling. And then you could extract a sentence or two from The Ghoul toheighten the puke reflex. Nothing too obscene. Routine ‘flies in her mouth’stuff. Big caption:Schaefer says, “Green River Strangler is an amateur.” We’ 11 surely think ofsomething. [Smiley face]5/10/89. What to call me: “Accused Serial Killer” is OK. Where you are off baseis in that you are thinking in terms of a formal legal accusation. Pull out yourGiant Dictionary and run accused down. I believe you’ll find that accused willfit, as ghoulish can be twisted to fit…Stone accuses me of 9 or 10 in thenewspaper.That’s your ticket to “Accused Serial Killer.” What do you think now, partner? 6/2/89. Spring Break: I re-wrote the whole thing…The police will run to theunsolved murder case book and look for a parallel; which is what I want. I wantpeople to be unsure. Is it really fiction or is it The Ghoul wearing a mask of afictionalist? The way it is now nobody will be sure. The way it was, the readersaid, good story! Set it down and forgot about it. See what I mean?…I had a variety of different characters I invented and wrote as. JessicaZurriaga was a dominatrix and ran the whole gamut of S/M & B/D fetish. I had twoprison women characters. One was a matron character. One was a girl on deathrow. This was nickel-dime stuff to pass time. What I learned was that the trickis to pin down the mark/fetishist…decide which fetish they are into and send anice letter with your photo in the corner…“and by the way buy my book Jessicaand the Crining Slave Boy for $20.” Or whatever…Another example: Panty fetish is common. Run the ad for panty fetish people.Letters come. You send the letter that tells them how you model panties for acatalog company and “I’ll model just for you—IF you subscribe to DDK.” You canget lingerie model photos for 50-100 each in quantity. I used to get Dad to sendme B&W panty model photos cost him 100 each. I sold them to niggers for$1.00-$2.00 each…Eventually we can get a load of fetish stories by GJS to sell the freaks. Noproblem. I have a real squirmy imagination. Whatever conveys a sense of theforbidden does well. 6/8/89. First I’ve heard about being the Sex Beast. Gee, I hope he put myaddress in there so I can get some cute groupies. That’s a good idea about agrant to study the Sex Beast. What’s a prototype serial killer? Are the 20victims listed? Who can they be? Milk Joel Norris for whatever information youcan get, then we’ll sue him for his gold teeth for libel. [Smiley Face] Sue him,his publisher, everybody. Great Publicity for K/F! [Smiley Face]Sounds like a good book title: The Sex Beast. The title alone would sell! But dotry to find out who my 20+ victims are in Oakland Park. “Killer Fact.” Sure.I’ll confess. Find me out from him who I’m supposed to have killed!!Well…I’m a real celeb. The Sex Beast. I like it better than the Butcher of BlindCreek. Hey, if anyone should get a grant to study the Sex Beast it should beyou…“I Slept With The Sex Beast of Oakland Park…and Lived to Tell the Tale!”Sounds like something out of Play girl…or Ann Rule’s genre. [Smiley Face] YourVery Own Sex Beast, [Monster Face] John [Smiley Face] 6/14/89. Don’t get me wrong. I like being the Sex Beast. It’s a hoot. Really,the funniest handle of all. I’m a Sex Beast yet I’ve never been accused of a sexcrime. It’s so bizarre I can only laugh. But a side of me does not find itamusing at all.Part of me is VERY PISSED OFF. Naturally so. Wouldn’t you be?Here are some hints on my past experiences working the mail order freak trade:1. Always require the freak to pay postage. 2. Photos: Freaks adore photos. Getsome black & white film and play. Matron Miller must be stern…a secret slutrevealing herself only a teeny bit at a time. An obedient freak should berewarded with a photo. Obedient as in sending $.3. Invite questions. This reveals the freak’s hidden desires. Remember, fetishand guilt go hand in hand.4. Personal touch. The kissed letter. The little handwritten note under themachine script.5. The pitch for cash…send me a little something.I got over a thousand letters on one ad I wrote: Imprisoned Stripper. I wrote asJerri and was doing about $100 (1975) a week without benefit of a machine toprint the letters. My fingers were raw from writing. That wasn’t even freaktrade. The nice thing is it’s all tax free… Figure with a little effort you canget 100 freaks at $50 a month each. Only way to start is to run some ads and seewhat the mail person delivers. [Smiley Face] I’ll answer ‘em. You print and sendthem out. 6/20/89. FBI-H wants to talk to me because I’m a TOP Serial Killer in his databank. He wants to discuss Sexual Sadism with me because his theory is that I ama sexual sadist and a SK (Serial Killer). Now this is between you and me. I’mnot the great SK and I’m not the great sadist. FBI-H doesn’t know that yet.The purpose in seeing FBI-H is to collect data for MQ…film, tape, etc. = $ forSL. If the project is done right. Big $. That’s OK. But to me personally theimportant thing is to get to the heart of the truth of the entire fucking messbecause it’s gotten entirely out of hand.Consider: I’m in a book as a prototype SK with over 20 victims near O.P. and anice fearsome title, the Sex Beast. Now it’s time to clear up the waters. Theway that’s done is to make a list; let FBI-H make a list. I’ll even help him. Noshit. I do want to know just how fucking bad and beastly I am. Unlike Ted I willnot hedge. I will confess all. But before I get to that point I need to know whois dead and who is missing. Real people. I want a big fucking box full ofpictures of real victims I supposedly killed 1963-1973. For FBI-H that will bean easy task. He puts out a request on the NCIC network to all police depts.homicide and missing persons bureaus, serial killer units, etc. for data ontheir 1963-73 unsolved cases. Particularly road whore killings. OK. We will goover each and every case and I will give a detailed confession to each crime.Then we go on the Box to see if it’s a True Confession or just more ActualFantasy. The Box will show either Truth or Deception. The True Confessions go inone pile, the False in another. Then I’ll plead guilty in Court to all casesthat come up as True Confession if the plea is to a reduced charge of anon-capital murder based on SK illness, and I receive admittance to a hospitalfor study as a SK prototype. All sentences will run concurrent and for aspecified time. Not an open-ended Life. My theory is this: If I am a real SKthen I need treatment and study, not torture dungeons.You (MQ) have a virgin S/K, the Greatest S/K of Them All, never before studiedby anyone. The H-person must give some quid pro quo to discuss sexual sadismwith the Master Sex Beast. It starts with the list and M.Q. access and help witha nice grant from Uncle Sammy so she can pay the cable company and Georgia Powerwhile recording for science The Confessions of the Sex Beast (on sale at allbetter bookshops). [Smiley Face]19907/20/90. Interesting story about Newton. I can’t wait to see what sort of lieshe printed about me in his book. The Joel Norris lies were pretty good.Encyclopedias are supposed to be real factual so Newton’s lies will be evenbetter, ultimately, than those of Norris. It seems to me that to become a SK allone needs are the unbiased allegations of police and prosecutors—guys that neverlie! When they read “False Confessions” I’ll be right up there with Lucas. Wealready know Lucas lies. I have a far better imagination so I’ll be able to liebetter and more convincingly in print. 7/30/90. Newton seemed sane and fair minded in his response. I’m wondering whostarted that Sex Beast crap?…I like to take negatives and turn them positive.Sex Beast might be a great title for the True Story [Smiley face]. 7/31/90. People might go for something real bizarre like: Ask the SerialKiller... or they may jump for Ask the Executioner… something along the outerlimits.Any ideas? I overtly gravitate toward that which is most offensive to thegreatest audience. I enjoy shocking the reader. Rubbing his nose in the shit andgore. 8/8/90. The Newton quote is excellent. [Smiley face]…Enclosed is one KBS (KillerBull Shit) = (Killer Best Selections) letter. I figured I’d send one to him andsee if he’s a true freak—as in he’ll pay for freak material. Maybe lure him into spend some money. You decide. 8/31/90. I am sending herein an idea for you to make up into a flyer.

You will never view murder dispassionately again!OK…It’s hype, but it is all based on the accusations that I have endured overthe past 18 years, so why not work it all into a personal mystique? After all,it’s only fiction!!19911/18/91. To add an enigmatic dimension ponder this thought that you are notamongst the 34. In light of what has been said about me by Stone and pals haveyou wondered why you are alive while others almost certainly are not? I alsoknow you’ve wondered how close you came to being on Stone’s list…and how many ofthose on the list were your surrogates. All I’ve told you is that ‘Stonewouldn’t lie.’ I have told you several times that the TS will be a story beyondyour strangest fantasies. Now let me say something else to encourage you tostick around instead of suiciding…You came down here and asked me if I was areal SK. OK. Fine. You got an enigmatic answer. Not a simple answer. Have youconsidered that IF you were married to me that you’d have husband/wifeconfidence in law and could never be compelled to testify against me or beprosecuted as an accessory even if I were to show you a basket of severed heads?Let’s turn that option over in your head. I’m said to be The Greatest SK of thiscentury. Either Stone is a liar from the onset or he knows more than he’stelling.You have said that what I write is socially valuable. Suppose I told you thatKF/ BKF is all true and that I can back it up with burial pits, that the metalrings where whores were hanged alive in the swamp can still be found (probably)and that Stone was correct to say #1 SK billing belongs to me? You are a sillybitch to even contemplate suicide when you have the top story of the century inyour pocket. I have told you that either way the habeas goes that you’ll get thestory…I am not suicidal or compelled to talk as T.B., HLL/OT and others are. I canwait to see what unfolds since the TS is still unfolding. I am also not crazyenough to direct any cop to any crime site, however I am crazy enough to proveto my wife that I am not full of bullshit. The wife who cannot be compelled totestify as to what she saw. Example: What if I showed you a collection ofskulls? Or heads in formaldehyde buried in a trunk? Could you write it from thepoint of view of the whore who is about to contribute her own head to thecollection? The whore would have every opportunity to admire the collection, seethe empty lab jar, be told she’d be a very valued addition to the collection.Could you capture the spirit of the event? Blondes and brunettes, Cathies &Sandies. Suppose I could show you something like that, something that no livingwoman ever saw, would you think meaSK?…I’ve had absolutely genuine experiences with Evil. I’ll tell you an absolutelyconfidential story here…There were some young women who were about to die.They were already naked for the slaughter. Frightened out of their witsnaturally, I fed on their fear—rather the evil entity did—and as I walked overto this one to kill her she said to me: Jesus loves you and so do I. It was asif a sheet of glass came down between us. She was as close to dying as 5 secondsand everything stopped. Frozen frame. I recall taking several steps back. Irecall it absolutely.Then another woman, she was about to be killed to; she said, “No, nobody couldlove him, not even God could love him.” I walked over to where she was laying onher back and looked down into her eyes and saw her hate. I killed her. It wasbloody and efficient. Then I killed the rest. The one who’d called out the nameof Jesus died quickly, mercifully. That was the only time in the career of thegreatest SK of them all that he ever faltered after the woman was naked forslaughter.You know that I am a creative person. I read The History of Torture, the worksof Schmidt and Berry on how women were properly hanged, the Sansones onbeheading and much more. I was an artist with a noose, a master with theheadsman’s blade; I’ve crucified women, watched the flies work on livingcuntflesh, seen gagged women strangle to death on their own vomitus. I’veskinned women. I loved killing whores…I can prove to you what I was if I get out but far more importantly is what Ihave become spiritually. The TS will shock you to your core. It’s pure evil,demons, and manifestations of violent horror through myself physically…KillerFiction is loaded with malignant energy from The Murder Channel. It’s almost asif I can plug into Bundy’s energy force and get it down on paper…So—I didn’t want to get into all this deeply but you need to know that Stonereally has no idea what I was up to…(I was framed, remember that)…This letter isprivate & confidential and for you personally and exclusively. No names, nolocations, just KBS but you can bet I can back it up should I get out of here…Icannot give you any details without the testimonial protections that come withmarriage…1/19/91. There were quite a few contributing factors that led up to my ‘goingout of my mind’ so to speak. Eventually we will explore them but I will tell youhere and now that plenty of young women died because you couldn’t help meresolve my various crisises in 1965. I tried to tell you about it but youcouldn’t deal with it. You bolted, abandoned me; that’s when it started. I triedto handle it, I even tried to get it over to a shrink but there was nobody in myworld who could give me a clue about what the problem’s roots were. Finally Idecided to just let it carry me along. I could come home soaked in blood and sayI’d skinned out a deer or a hog. What I was skinning was whores. Once I went fora whole year and murdered every woman I had sex with. A YEAR!!! I even wentafter groups of women successfully. Bundy was a pure amateur compared to me. Hewas sex driven. I was hate driven. Big difference. He was guilt ridden, I was akilling machine. He strewed corpses across the country, I made a whore disappearforever. I was extremely conscientious about it. You know how dedicated I am togetting a thing right.I could have a perfectly normal sex life with Teresa because I was not a sexkiller. I was a destroyer of evil. A paladin. I was so skilled at hanging womenthat I could, sometimes, kill them so quickly that they wouldn’t even pee whileon the rope. That’s a remarkable feat. I never at any time required more than 2strokes to behead a woman. Never. I was absolutely skilled at it. I had a lot ofpractice.Bundy couldn’t even get a hard-on unless he was strangling the shit out of somegirl or bashing her brains in. Apervo-sex killer. I’m perfectly well-adjustedsexually. You know that. [Smiley-face] I laugh my ass off about all these SKexperts who say SKs are all sexually maladjusted and cannot function with anormal woman. What crap. Hey, dead pussy is disgusting. Believe me. I’d go outand lift a few heads and come home and screw Teresa into the bed. I’d get a roadwhore (if she was a cutie) and have sex, then pay her, and then kill her! ThenI’d rob her. [Smiley-face] You can believe it or call it KBS but here’s mypoint: I’d really like to make some sense out of it.As you say to me: The cops don’t have anything on me. They don’t even havecorpses for most of the tally and the absolute truth is that I was framed onJessup & Place. It’s just so bizarre it makes me crazy. So you have that as astory twist. Incredible. What does it all mean? It certainly does mean that Godwas watching out for me. To what purpose? I don’t know just yet. But it’ssomething.I let Satan get control of me. I hated Evil. I wanted to destroy Evil. I wentand immersed myself in the battle but destroyed myself in the process. God savedme by allowing me to be framed by corrupt people. Their prosecution was built ona lie but my own acts were also unjustifiable. I was, for a long time,comfortable in the Tightness of what I’d been doing. Now I can see I was deadfucking wrong and out of control as a rational human entity. I’m truly sorryabout all those things today. I really am. I would never hurt anyone (not evenStone, Snake and pals) if I walked out of here tomorrow. I’ve been spirituallyreprogrammed. (Bob Erler would understand me) My question right now is how tomake my horrible experience a positive force for social good and spiritualadvancement.How can we do this? Obviously with extreme caution. I don’t want to gloss overthe essential depravity and ghastly pure evilness of what occurred but I do notwant to get my self in any more trouble by digging up body dumps and privategraveyards. Maybe we could let KF serve as the foundation for the TS and thensay in the TS that I admit all accusations made against me. I deny nothing. Isee no reason to go beyond Killer Fiction in TS. Anyone who wants gore can go toKF. The TS should be as accurate as possible and deal with how I got to theplace where I went off the rails of humanity…and how I got back from the abyssof madness…and that was because of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ… 1/20/91. I am the top SK and can prove it. I am not going to prove it to thecops to my detriment. I can and shall prove it to you personally and privatelyhowever I do not want to do a book that glorifies the acts. I want to make it apositive social statement…I will never show anyone but yourself the actualhanging trees, (Stone’s limb is not from my tree) butchering sites and privategraveyards. You alone will have the secrets of what really happened at the deathsites.You squirm over Denise Naslund being degraded. Let me tell you, Denise neverknew what terror was all about. I can tell you about whores who screamed andscreamed and screamed…clitorectomies, the way to skin a cunt pelt, creativethings to do with cigarettes and nipples. Ted was an amateur. Denise was luckyshe met him instead of me. But then I wasn’t kidnapping girls from beaches andschoolyards. Even so, you can’t publish what I did. People would not believe it.The TS will be told by you or it won’t be done. I do not require it be done. Iam forgiven by Jesus for those acts. I am healed of those impulses to committhem. I have some trouble even coming to terms that I did do such things onceupon a time. I’m aware that nobody other than yourself has a capacity tounderstand a little of what occurred. You were there when I was trying toovercome the rage. OK. I lost that fight, but later I won it over. What occurredwas not your fault in any manner. Your abandonment of me then did trigger yearsof brutal slaughter but that’s long past and now we have this opportunity to gointo it in depth and try to make some sense of it. Don’t we? It’s a uniquechance for us to examine it…turn the negative past into a positive future.As you know I’ve always harped on Stone’s list of 34. In 1973 I sat down anddrew up a list of my own. As I recall, my list was just over 80. I wasn’texactly taking names. J/P was a F.U. because I was never there. That was borneout by the forensic evidence, there’s nothing at all to put me at the crimescene. No getting around that, is there? Same with G/Wilcox in Ft. Pierce. Youcan prove I didn’t do it by forensics. But I was very careful never to leave apattern. I killed women in all ways from shooting, strangling, stabbing,beheading to odd ways such as drowning, smothering and crucifixion. One Iwhipped to death with a strap, another I beat to jelly with a baseball bat whileshe was hanging by her wrists.I was the best. But then I like to do things well. I renounce what I did, what Iwas, and am absolutely sure I’d never do such an act again. I was trulypossessed by murder demons or whatever it’s called. I want to stress that thisletter is absolutely confidential. If you can’t handle it destroy it. I’vecarefully avoided making any specific claim here about any specific case solegally all you have is KBS.1/21/91. It’s actually very uncomfortable for me to try to go back into time andre-capture the emotions and feelings that accompanied those horrible acts. Forme it’s not a thing I take lightly. It’s not fiction. I can deal with thingsfiction all right but dealing with fact is upsetting. I would never even attemptto deal with such matters with a stranger. There are enormous trust factorsinvolved.I was so skilled at my craft that no pattern has ever been attributed to me.I’ve never been connected to a crime scene anywhere. Even the FBI does notconsider me to be a suspect in any unsolved crimes. When you consider this interms of skill it’s a remarkable feat. The SK experts try to tell you that SKsare sex killers. This is a generality based on their belief that murder ismisdirected sexual energy, and for the most part this is a truth. However in myown situation, as you will recall, my rage came up when females whored so themurderous act came from moral outrage rather than sexual interest. I rarelykilled a woman nude.I set my projects up like military campaigns. There were two primary types: RoadWhores, which were almost always “quick kills,” and whores of long acquaintance.I put a minimum of 6 months between the initial contact and the kill proper.Some whores I tracked for several years. A woman I met in Ft.L. might die a yearlater in Indiana. It was easy. I was an excellent lover. A whore would recallthe good sex and come to me at a call. I had a whole address book filled withprospects. I’d go on a campaign every summer. I’ve worked almost every State andall provinces of Canada. Quietly and efficiently. Most victims were buried deepand the area restored to a natural look. No grave mound or such. No shallowgraves. No dumping the corpse in a ditch or a river or canal. I used manydifferent ploys. I was completely dedicated to what I was doing. Absolutelyfocused on it from 1965 to 1972. I had many female friends, so there were normalsexual relationships. Sex is wonderful between people who are friends or lovers.I had periods when I chose not to have such relationships, but I never allowedmyself to kill for sex or as an alternative to sex per se.Many of my kills were much like the Tiffany Sessions case in Gainesville. MissSessions goes out to jog and never comes back. If Tiffany had whored inLauderdale a year earlier and her partner rolled up in a car she’d likely get inif just for a chat. She’d be dead inside 15 minutes and buried within 2 hours,or driven maybe a hundred miles away from Gainesville for burial. It’s reallyvery easy to do when you work according to a plan. I am nothing if notorganized. When I was hanging Kates I did so with efficiency. I had it workedout precisely what would be done. A reasonable, workable, excellent course ofaction and it was viable year after year. Caution not passion. This is not tosay each kill was the same. They were not. I was interested in variety but itwas not impromptu variety. My aim was to kill whores, not necessarily toy withthem or torture them. But I did torture a few.I am not going to burden you with specific cases because then you would betempted to run to FBI-H…You will be concerned about if I can prove I am the #1SK. Probably not. Certainly I can prove many cases, give you skulls and bones,all that sort of thing. I’m not claiming a huge number, it would only come toperhaps 10 to 12 per year for 8 years. I had a list of around 80 I could recall.That’s not really a lot balanced against Lucas/Toole but it beats Bundy andGreen River and the others. I’ve killed as many as 3 at one time. I would say itruns between 80-110. But over 8 years and 3 continents. I did very well in NorthCentral Colorado. I worked the major passes and got whores headed for the WestCoast. I also worked the trans-Canada highway; around Calgary area was good. Butmany of those kills were quick ones. I really do not remember the exact number,or every kill. Some were very memorable. One whore drowned in her own vomitwhile watching me disembowel her girlfriend. I’m not sure that counts as a validkill. Did the pregnant ones count as two kills? It can get confusing.I don’t suppose the individuals are important to your study so we don’t need towork with specific persons or locations, do we? You can think about what proofsyou might require and maybe someday I can come up with them for you. I will notdo anything suicidal for you such as take cops to bones, never. The SK businesswas a part of a former life. I’d never return to it. Have no desire to return toit.Now we need to decide what to do with this situation. I will work only with you.No FBI-H. No shrink. You must swear confidentiality. I will (upon release fromprison) do retrogressive hypnosis on a minimum of 5 cases (a shooting, hanging,strangling, beheading and skinning) but that depends on my release and theconfidentiality involved. Perhaps this will be sufficient proof of SK status?If you cannot be faithful to my trust in you then do not pursue this thing. I amprobably at least one of the top SKs of this century. Certainly one of the mostinteresting and maybe the most articulate and introspective. I am no doubt themost skillful killer. Cool and calm at my avocation, and that is unusual. I feltgood about killing whores and took a great deal of pleasure in my work. Iregarded killing whores as a mission of personal importance. I’d work severaljobs to get enough cash for a trip around the country each year; then I’d be onmy mission and totally dedicated to my premeditated goals. Sometimes I’d havewomen specifically targeted in other States but I was always flexible. Never didone know me by my real name…I’d call her and say: “Hi, this is Joe from Atlanta.Remember, we met in Ft.L. last year?…” Like that. And the whore would/or wouldnot meet me at some local spot and 4 hours later I’d be 150 miles away with hercorpse in the trunk ready for burial. Her friends might say, “She went to meetsome guy from Atlanta and never came back.” I’d be in another State beforeanyone even officially missed her. I never had any problems on that score.If you want to look for GS victims, look for women age 14-35 who disappearedbetween 1965-1972. I never knowingly killed anyone under 16 but some had no ID.I’ve hanged 16-year-old whores. I never knew the names of many road whores. Or Ionly knew false names. That’s a problem right there. Any time you choose you cango down to the Lauderdale strip and find runaways who will talk play-for-pay.The little bitches look lost. Just go up and ask if they want to work for a ladywho will give them a nice apt, cash percentage and dope connection. Days freefor the beach, nights tricking with men sent by the lady. No street work. Mostcan’t wait to go with you. I took them out and hanged them. Straight to thehanging tree. Dumbest cunts in the world. I had these two tied and noosed, abouttwo minutes from suspension and she goes, ‘What’s going on? Are you going tohang us?’ Too stupid to know she was being murdered. She was hot to ride thesheets, couldn’t wait to meet the madam. ‘What kind of dope can we get? How muchmoney will we get?’ She didn’t even have a full pubic bush!Where they came from I couldn’t tell you. I can only tell you where they endedup. Runaways. ‘Comb your hair so you look smart, honey. Lay on some lipstick.Open up that blouse and let me see your titties.’ They were so gullible. Thecall girls were so much better. Confident. Sassy. Sleek. But in the end theywere brought down off their sexual thrones. They’d wheedle, beg wonderfully, anddie in the most horrible ways. I enjoyed working on professional sex kittenswith the knife. It was a pro who was slashed with a whip, a pro who was beateninto jelly with a baseball bat, and the first woman to be skinned was “highclass tail.” I always got the phone numbers and addresses of their “bestgirlfriends.” “Hello. Is this Meg? Suzie’s friend? She asked me to call you. Canyou meet me with $500 for bond money? Come alone. Be discreet. Suzie says youcan be trusted.” Usually the pal would zip right there and in a few hours shetoo would be in hell.I’d have nice chats with the prosties. They’d do anything to survive. I’d knoweverything about their best girlfriends before they died. A classy prostie willpay well to live. They have stashes of cash where they live. I’d call thefriend, send her to get the stash cash and deliver it to a certain place becauseSuzie ‘got a deal on some righteous shit’ and needs the money fast. I’d getSuzie, the cash and the friend. I had a wonderful time with professionalharlots. They usually understood they were in mortal danger once they realizedthey’d fallen for the fake cop routine. You could almost hear the voice insidetheir heads go ‘Uh-Oh!’ Several of them said that they’d had dreams orpremonitions that they’d die at the hands of a ‘trick.’ They were fun kills.Every one of them. We played games. Russian Roulette: You suck the gun, I’llspin the cylinder. Games about asphyxiation: Gag the girl, hold her nose; wearthe plastic bag until the girl turns blue—breath holding contests, strangulationcontests, new ways to wear your nylons. Piss on my seat covers, I’ll piss onyour face. OK, honey? And if they played well they died easy. If they werebitches about it they died very, very nastily…like hang her by her ankles,gagged, then piss up her nose. Yes, there were so many unpleasant ways to killthem. Most of them played nice and prayed for the best.Speaking purely logistically, murdered professional whores may never have hitmissing persons sheets because I’d contact the girlfriends and tell them I wasreferred by Suzie. They’d say, ‘Hey, where is she? Everyone’s been asking abouther.’ I’d say, ‘Well, last Monday she was at the Beachside Hotel at Acapulcowith a guy called Chuck. I don’t know where she is today.’ I would kill onefriend and lay several false trails maximum. I don’t imply here that I did thisevery day or even every month. I just did it regularly. When I wanted a superiormurder experience I called a call-girl, they were a special treat for meparticularly the ones who were intellectually acute as well as physicallylovely. The call girls were a breed apart from the street hookers. The streethookers would collapse emotionally and succumb to terror and hysteria. The callgirl would be snapping her intellect looking for the key to the exit of herdilemma. They’d try all the gambits in their tricksy minds. I’d let them talk. Iappreciated it when they finally understood that it wasn’t a sex thing but adeath thing. They’d look at me and say, ‘I’m going to die, aren’t I?’ I’d say,‘Yes.’ You had to appreciate their expressions, the looks they gave me. I wasn’tviolent, brutal, threatening. I was calm. Utterly serene.They knew they had no power over me. Maybe the first time they’d met a man whocould not be controlled by their physical charms and mental acuity. Each onedied differently. Some were acquiescent; a few kicked up a fuss, but they alldied. I enjoyed each and every experience.But this is all 20 years ago or more; so what purpose is served to relate itfactually incident by incident? Exploring the emotional side of it might beworthwhile. I’ve mixed feelings about it. On the one side, I am annoyed that Iwas framed by Dean & Schwarz & Stone on the J-P case. They try to make me looklike a jerk and make up all that bullshit when I am obviously cleared by theforensic evidence in both J-P and G-Wilcox. They try to make those cases lookalike when in fact they are obviously dissimilar. That annoys me a lot. Ofcourse that could be their strategy. They know I’m a top notch SK but also knowthey can never prove it because I do perfect clean up work so what they do isrelease lies and misinformation that makes me look like a bumbler. Same strategywith Dolan. Everything I said about Dolan is absolutely true. They try to say Ikilled Lee H. even though Dolan was a dealer, Lee was a snitch and Dolan was oneof Lee’s suppliers. I know this because / introduced Lee to Dolan. Dolan told metwice that he killed Lee and the Hallock woman. He tried to recruit me to killN.K. Price and two others. That’s fact, which I told Snake, who told cops. Butthe cops ignored Dolan. Just let people think that Lee & Hallock were mine. Idon’t need Dolan’s kills to pad my score! That’s insulting to me. Myaccomplishments were excellently planned and executed but they were bad deeds. Ican see that now. I had a purity of purpose but was absolutely wrong in myimplementation of my purpose: to stamp out Evil. That’s an impossible task, andmurder can never be the answer. 1/22/91. OK. My letters to you are confidential. Particularly the most recentstuff about the SK topic. You wanted to know if you were wasting time with me asa SK. That’s a valid economic question. I’m assuring you that you have one ofthe top SK’s of all time on your MQ roster and that I shall be able to prove itif I get out. What proof do you require? I cannot prove them all. I need to besure I don’t cut my own throat with this business. I was never one to strewcorpses all over the landscape like some people we know. So you may not goaround telling my secrets—our secrets—to my detriment. You have a pretty goodrealization of what offends me so just use your own good sense in that area. OK?I’m concerned about what you will think and do when you find out that what youcurrently believe to be KBS is not. Right now you think it’s all KBS because youcannot conceive that what I’ve told you can be true. I’ve committed horrorsbeyond your ability to comprehend. Get me into retrogressive hypnosis and youwill be stunned by what I have to say. You see me as I am now, a person renewedin Christ; unconsumed by hate. Passive even. My goals are spiritual, eternal,unworldly. I need to work to plug into the Murder Channel. 25 years ago I’d hanga cunt and watch her kick out her life and never give it a second thought. Youwere there before the madness began and after it ended. I know some whores whodied smelling shit and Chanel. Their own. Maybe it’s too intimate to put intoprose. I’ve told you and told you that you are onto a story beyond your wildestdreams. You think I’m KBS-ing you. Ha!I loved you in 1965. I love you still. It’s not sexual. I love you unreservedly.I don’t care who you screw. I’m far more concerned about whether you can handlethis TS stuff—especially when we get to the part where you personally wereinvolved. We shall address all that down the road. I do wonder if you’ll betrayme as you did then; not sexually, but in some other manner—perhaps because ofwhat I did to your female sisters…Still I think the story has merit if we do ittogether. [Smiley-face] 1/24/91. We can cover every case. Some will be in more detail than others. OnceI’ve exhausted their list then we can go to work on my list. The problem I haveis not so much in giving you the proofs you’d want but at what place do I draw abright line?Example: I could take you to various locations and show you where corpses wereset out to rot as described in BKF. I could show you the pits where the cars arethat were feeding stations for crabs. But do I show you bones? Skulls? You cansay to me now—and you do—John, you are full of KBS. The MQ could right now getlaughed out of Court if she tried to sell the reality of BKF to a jury. All thatchanges the minute I give you a corpse or a head. I can show you where victimswere hanged, where they rotted in the open air or where they rotted underwaterbut as long as I don’t show you where the bones are so to speak you are OKlegally. But does failure to show bones constitute failure to prove theallegations in the TS? We’d need to resolve that. I cannot prove quite a few ofthe kills, some 25 years old. I cannot even give you an exact figure, but I’dsay between 80-11. Since I went after transients, runaways, hitch-hikers andhookers the police reports would probably have issued at the place where theyoriginally lived, not Fla.Ted couldn’t remember all his kills. He had only a percentage of mine and theywere less removed in time too. Mine are 1965-1972. I’ve killed as many as 3 atone time and cannot tell you today what their names were or where they camefrom. I can show you where they died. Maybe some personal relics such as rottenclothing, shoes, such as that. This is not a simple problem. Proof. [Frownyface] 1/27/91. What I tell you is absolutely confidential. I will not be giving youany specific detail in letters. It’s KBS. The day I show you proof it’s not KBSthen we have a very different sort of situation. Right? There is the matter ofmy family to consider as well. Remember that.My battle has been to overcome the problem of SK-ism. I believe I haveaccomplished this through Jesus Christ. It’s also helpful that I was able tohave had these experiences so there is no mystery or area that needs to beexplored. I am hetero-sexual but a female cannot get my interest via sexualallure. I am indifferent to this form of female control over men because I knowthat females are all the same sexually. Their shapes vary but once you peel themdown what you see is a cunt. The quest for cunt is instinctive so then itbecomes a matter of self-control over a natural urge. Once a person realizeswhat’s going on it’s controllable.Killing whores is the same. It’s very pleasant but after a while it becomespredictable and there is no more mystery involved. The interest becomes theindividual as opposed to the act of killing. Since I’ve experienced every sortof killing that interested me I’ve no desire at all to go back and repeatsomething that could only be repetitive. There are no great passions remaining.Both the sex and the killing was fascinating but ultimately unfulfilling. Timefor something new and I believe that is to be found in things spiritual ratherthan things physical. I am even of a mind to consider that this entire killingthing got started because I viewed whores as a serious threat to my soul. I nowthat’s too simplistic but I believe it was a large contributing factor. Ibelieved what the priests had to say about women, sex and hellfire. Remember Imade daily mass for about 4 years straight (1960-1964) so I was under a certainCatholic mind control thing…Well, we’ll have to explore all that; maybe underhypnosis. It’ll make a wonderful book if we can decide on how to present it in adignified manner. 2/27/91. Sure, I could write Murder Demons. But you wouldn’t like it, youwouldn’t believe it, and it would never make it to the PG audience you areangling for. You ask me to write a torture scene, yet you constantly criticizeme for mentioning excrements as if I toss it in there gratuitously. You wanttorture: If I wrote you about killing a certain hooker with an emergency roadflare…they look like a stick of dynamite. Grease it up and use it on a whorelike a dildo. Flares are fairly long. Run it up to her cervix, nice strokes. Runit up her poop chute.Easy strokes. Pull it out and there’ll be a big dab of shit at the end. Ask her,‘You want that nasty stuff up your cunt?’ Shakes her head. So you pull up thelittle tab and it bursts into magnesium fire. Give her a red hot fuck. Push thatfire up her snatch. It will burn through her cervix and go into her womb, thenthrough her womb and into her guts. Convulsions like you can’t imagine and thatwhore will literally pump shit out of her ass. Stick that flare all the way upin her and her cunt will smoke.Damnedest thing you could ever see. I’d say shock kills them more than anythingelse. Yes, I can give you some first rate torture. But you’d never use itbecause it’s too nasty. You can’t even handle tame stuff like “Freak Trade.” Sowhy would you tell me to write it real and true when you must realize you can’tpublish it? 3/1/91. Now for something confidential…We have been dealing in fiction. Youmentioned about the eyes. I have given you a very brief glimpse of somethingthat no woman alive today has ever seen. You understood the message viscerally.You were able to snap down on a message that should erase any doubt you ever hadabout whether or not I am for real. I was able to communicate an absolute truthto you with a single look…You now know one secret. Silence of the Lambs is areality. Oh, not the exact same scenario as the film; not the silly motiveHarris offers his readers. You have access to the real thing!Consider the nameless, pricey prostitute who is handcuffed, her ankles tied, andafter much time she says, dreading the answer, ‘Are you going to kill me?’ Sheis answered with the eyes. She sees the eyes, the whetstone, the razor sharpskinning blade. How does she handle that reality? Badly, of course. Like a cowin a slaughter chute.The novelization of the reality would be no problem but you would not be able todeal with those realities. You request a ‘torture scene’ but a graphic torturescene that was grounded in reality you could never bring yourself to publish.Your own pre-conceived notions of what murder is all about is based on TV andnovels and these mediums are all sanitized. Every time I deal in a reality in myfiction that has to do with an excrement you scream taboo yet one of the veryinitial fear reactions women have is to pee in their clothes. They startshivering as if freezing to death and while they’re shaking they’re peeing allover everything. They issue a stencxh of sweat that is very distinct, anabsolute smell of fear. The bowels don’t go until the onset of pure terror,usually, the girl will succumb to terror and go into a state of hysteria andlose control of herself completely even to the point of drooling. It’sunbelievably disgusting; not ‘sexy.’ they are prone to vomit. But all this istaboo in current prose. Right? So how can I write about what you request?Obviously I cannot. It’s not a question of not being able to write such a novel,it’s a problem of overcoming the social and cultural taboos that accompany realsex murder when it’s reduced to popular prose. No?I have told you that you are privy to a more sensational story than you can everrealize. You are not going to get it in a rush or without establishing serioustrust over a long period of time…You got a personal one-on-one revelation thatcommunicated to you that you’ve a unique opportunity to do a major work onsomeone once called “The Greatest Killer of Women in the USA in this Century.”Not #2, but #1. The Greatest. And the most proficient. I’d like you to do Toolebefore you take a crack at me, for the experience. Nobody else will get the GJSstory. I know you’re impatient but that’s just too bad. I won’t be rushed,forced, intimidated or relax my caution. You’ll get it all, in time. Trust isthe keynote. 3/9/91. I was pleased to hear you liked the Murder Demons scenario I sent toyou. It was a basic first rough draft. I think it’s probably hard for the readerto catch the insanity of such acts of butchery, the violence is progressive. Thescenario in MD is an advanced case of insanity. A bright, luscious, sassy sexkitten is far more interesting than some dirty road whore because she knows at acertain point that she has encountered the living nightmare that sheinstinctively understands she will not survive. A change occurs at thatrealization; physically the woman emits a stinking greasy sweat almost as if tofend off the predator by making herself hugely unattractive via smell. It’s notthe smell of exertions, or sexual trysting, but a rank odor and verydistinctive. Unpleasant. A smell of terror.There are many small things such as this one can recount if one knows thedynamics of reducing a confident sex pot call-girl to a whimpering lump ofravaged flesh that begs for death. I guess I could do MD as a novel. Could giveit a try…I think it will be explosive publicity wise if Stone comes out and sayssomething about the proof of my being a necrophiliac / cultist is in my stories.The KF stories are low key compared to what is coming in Murder Demons…if I canpull it off. 3/10/91. I’ve been sharing things with you at our visits that are very private.It’s a question of trust. We are making good progress and I want to let you knowhere in a general way, avoiding specifics, that most of what you have in thepast thought was KBS is not. You cannot in your most bizarre imaginationconceive what went on out in those swamps…it was pre-meditated, cold-blooded,wanton savagery that I’m not sure can be replicated on paper. It’s a bit likethe AC A reporter who said OT is in a separate category. I’m like that. Therewere no ‘patterns’ to lock onto. I’m a ‘category of one’ and so far off the endof the bell curve that I’m honestly concerned that if I told you what reallyhappened you’d be too freaked to continue our relationship which has come backin a very healthy way. I keep saying, ‘You have no idea of what you’re on towith me,’ and it’s true. It was very much a matter of Murder Demons and Jilani,for all her insanity, made that very clear and she was not the only one…I was so glad to hear Nolte’s girlfriend freaked out after reading KF. Yes, theyare fiction, but yes, they are real. The astute reader will be able to discernthat they have a rare look into the face of death and madness…My problem hasbeen, how do I get where I want to go in reality without SL betraying me to thecops? That’s been a hard question but one we can solve, I think, via the use offiction as a medium. MD as a novel in the voice of The Ghoul. I won’t give youany real people, places, etc. that a cop could use as a fact and you would haveto agree to always stress that the book is a work of fiction, albeit written bya man said to be the Greatest Killer of Women this century. The important thingis that you understand that what you have is reality. The proof will not be thedisinterred heads of nameless sluts. The proof will be the prose. The outlinescenario I sent of MD is only a hasty few hours 1st R.D. I was thinking thatyour response would be an angry one, that the great truths would fly over yourhead and you’d snap at me about the excrement…(you can torture her but she can’tshit…) never aware of the factual reality that captive whores smell of sweat andurine always after a few hours and that ultimately the victim defecates! Killher quickly and the BM is simply a response to contracting muscles, kill herslowly and her bowels get loose and eventually she can’t hold her mess andshe’ll spew a volcano of crap, a shit puree that is all slimy and hugelydisgusting and it gets all over everything. The victim becomes stunned andsubdued when she unloads in her clothes. It’s a curious thing. Most women willpee from sudden fright when the capture occurs so wet pants is a reality but thecaptive eventually floods her clothes after some hours. She gushes piss. It’slike a marker on the road to her doom, and predictable.MD will, of necessity, be repetitive if you want reality. The SKs businessinvolves a certain repetition but a creative SK, a student of murder, issomewhat more interesting…Another thing: I think it’s very necessary to stress fiction and frameup toavoid the sorts of problems you mentioned about Bret Ellis. I don’t want thoseproblems and neither do you. They can be avoided by using care. Does ThomasHarris get such threats? We need to take care to minimize such things. This verything is one important consideration I evaluate when considering my futureapproach when I go back to Court. If I yell frameup (which I can do with clearconscience because it’s true) then a lot of that hate gets defused. The verymoment Stone screams “KF proves he did it!” which he will do, then you have anational soapbox to go after Ellis & Harris & all the others. It becomes aRushdie situation in a sense. And you will be handling it. Huge publicity. Youcan see it in your mind’s eye, can’t you? All this is coming toward you (us) intime. You get concerned because your own ‘sense of music’ has shut down and itupsets you. But you don’t see it in terms of your spiritual self (music isspiritual) narrowing and focusing on what your inner self senses coming towardyou on several serious levels: Murder Frame-up, Literary Freedoms, and RealMurder Demons. You’ve had a fit over the reality of whorehouse hang-shit whichis harmless fetish. But in MD you will have to deal with almost 10 years of themost horrifying murders that you could never imagine, a secret life that nobodyhas ever learned of.I personally did recruitment of hookers. I had them sign contracts to work inFla. or other places. All very formal. Work conditions. Housing. Dope perks. Allpart of the hunt! C’mon, we’ll drive out and meet The Boss. They went toslaughter, sometimes 2 and 3 at one time. I’d hang them. Behead them. Drownthem. Shoot them. Gut them. Skin them. Crucify them on real crosses. And muchmore…Stone introduced my machete into evidence. Hey, I had a real beheading axe.I had a real beheading block where real whores knelt and perished in the ancientdeath rituals. They brought in my mooring lines…I had beautiful, stretched andoiled hanging ropes that stretched carefully selected beauty’s necks. Stone’sshow was a farce. Even so, I sure couldn’t drop stuff like this on you until wehad established certain trusts. You’d yell KBS. Ha! You simply don’t know thedepth of what went down. You can’t handle it except in small increments. It’stoo horrible and too much. We’ll just have to take it a little at a time.Explore it. Together. I guess that’s enough for today. 3/11/91. Today I got the enclosed denial of the habeas from the Bar. Note thedenial was Dec. 12, 1990. I’m wondering why nobody—like my lawyers—never toldme. Most urgent that Notice of Appeal be filed. Last chance is 11th Circuit… 3/12/91. As for myself. You will not be disappointed when we get to the TS. Ineed to get the legal part settled before I can get into the TS. Keep in mindthat what I do I do well and extravagantly. I like to be the best at what I try.Why I could write a book about my travels and adventures in the outlands ofhuman existence and what I met there and what the voices told me. Oh yes, therewere voices. Voices with perfect clarity. Some of my most intense experienceswere certainly spiritual…but not religious. I want an end to the legal part so Ican freely explore, with you, the other realms. 4/9/91. What crimes am I supposed to confess? Sykes? Farmer? Briscolina?What do you think Murder Demons is? Fiction? You want ‘confessions’ but youdon’t recognize them when I anoint you with them and we’ve just gotten started.SL is not gonna get some cheap exploitation of the SK experience. No sanitizedAnn Rule or Darcy O’Brien mainstream SK-fluff. The TS will put the reader onsite. Murder is nasty. Disgusting. I’m not gonna participate in any “Murder CanBe Fun” stories. We’re still kicking around how to deal with factual nastinesssuch as pissy jeans and shitty panties. Haven’t even touched on the ones havingtheir periods, the ones who vomit while gagged, a girl who’s been sitting in herown shit offering sex as she watches her rope being noosed. Sex, the slut’sanswer to everything. It’s not nice, none of it. To write it in a way that couldbe construed as attractive violates something. You never get a clear picture ofTed kneeling over the Chi-O girl gnawing on her buttock, her anus plugged with aClairol bottle. It’s all fuzzy and amorphous. My girls deserve better. They weretoo filthy to consider fucking. Nobody ever mentions that about murder. A sexkiller I was not. I am unique. I guarantee it. But when I do a MD novelizationof the reality it has to be a reflection of the actual horrifying acts not somewatered own mainstream pablum. No?? Can I do it? Certainly I can. I will too. Inproper time. 4/17/91. I’ve been thinking through a piece about how I got into S/M with CW atan early age. She was a pure maso and trained my teen self to be her sadopartner. Classic pattern. Masos (called ‘Bottoms’ in the freak life) call thescenarios and require a partner who has good control to interact with. (Sadosare called Toppers’) By the time I was 17 I was a skilled ‘topper’—thanks to CW.[Smiley face] There was a real conflict because I’m not a true topper—as SLknows. I’m a natural romantic so Sado went against my emotional grain however Idid freak with CW regularly. So what I had, at age 18, was a blend of “normal”relations and a good knowledge of S/M as a topper.SK-ing was simply carrying the topper role beyond the parameters of the scene.Easy to do emotionally if you are a veteran topper. “Legion of Decency” toucheson that weird life I had in addition to the normal life. It’s mental andemotional discipline involved. S&M is like a stage act. It’s all ritual andfantasy. Fun, really, if you are secure in the roles. Being introduced into thegames at age 16 probably got me twisted to some degree but not hopelessly so. Bythe time “Gatorbait” occurred I was a skilled topper, not a slave to emotionsthat would go out of control during a sexual encounter. There were other factorsas well but CW was a princess wherein S/M was concerned. Pure Maso. So you haveGatorbait reality and LOD reality, both fictionalized. I was thinking ofsomething on the line of pre-Gatorbait, maybe one of CW’s scenes. No murder. Nosevere violence. She wasn’t a pain freak. No blood. She was hot for mastery insex. Force her, ‘rape’ her, slap her around, rip off her clothes, light bondagestuff only. If she felt threatened then she’d fuck like a rabbit. She had nochoice. Fuck or die. I came to understand it once I began to research and writeS/M, B/D, etc. I mull it over but there are a lot of raw nerves still exposed.It’s not easy to address it. 4/19/91. Had ES/RS not framed me I’d be perfectly content to fly right into therole of “The Great SK” for you. RS already dubbed me the Greatest SK in U.S.History so all I need to do is accept the position. But I cannot in goodconscience do that just yet. My private graveyards are private, not public. TheSK experience is a personal one, not a public one. All they could do was accuseme of known murders, that I did not do and when I screamed about it loud enoughthey had to admit I wasn’t really connected to those cases in any criminal way.Time has even proven me innocent in a number of the cases; others wereconvicted, missing persons did come back alive. I can take a certain pride inthe fact that I am The Greatest SK because I’ve never been connected to a crimescene anywhere. The J-P crime scene is an insult to an organized SK. It annoysme to be accused of leaving such a mess strewn about because GJS never left amess anywhere. Not from the very first one to the last one.I’m no Henry Lee Lucas with a death wish or a partner or living witnesses topoint fingers at me. I never ran around leaving people dead in a roadsideditch…and I feel no obligation to a society that condones a murder FU. SL shallhave it all in good time but I will not be rushed nor will I now “cooperate”with the police. Fuck the police. Fuck society. Anyone who wants the insidetrack can put down their cash and read the book. Yes, I told you I’d give younames, dates, places, but your current position is that if I give them to youthat you will give them to the cops. So get real yourself. I’m not going todeath row for you. 4/20/91. The problem with telling it is that it does become repetitious. I wasnever locked into a specific fantasy or ritual the way SKs are. The average SKis recognizable by the M.O. but my situation is an anomaly. I was a combo of anumber of different factors. The early S/M stuff with CW gave me a taste forenjoying fantasies that I could incorporate into SK-ing but it wasn’tnecessarily predominate or impelling. True, the rope was the usual M.O. but thatdepended on the venue and mood. It’s sort of complex and not precisely inkeeping with what SK experts like JN and others write about it. 5/18/91. Sadistic old me: When I was with you in 1965 I’d never had a “straight”sexual relationship before so you were the first—and my preference—but after youand then L—, I was more drawn into FT type girls. I had a ‘double’ sex life.During the late 60s there was a large focus on obtaining the ‘Big-O’—the mostintense orgasm sensation. People in the sexual underground know that the supremeorgasm is achieved by ligature strangulation…sensations so transcendent thatfreaks are constantly dying from hanging themselves. FBI-H wrote a whole bigthing about it—I think…I read what he sent way back when. Both genders can getoff on this but more men get killed at it due to failure to understand how tomanage the scene. Do it alone and you are gonna end up dead, eventually. I hadfour women over a period of almost four years who were stone freaks for this.Three of them would go ‘all the way’: Full suspension, death strap bondage andhood. The fourth lady could never bring herself to do full suspension on ‘go allthe way.’ She went for upper body pinions, no hood, and slow, controlledstrangulation. The first three were greedy for the ‘O’ but #4 was into ‘thescene.’ There must be perfect trust. The girl puts her life on the line and getshooked on a sexual sensation that is so powerful people die trying to achieveit. You are not the type female who can understand the female submissive…believeit or not there are women running around who cannot enjoy sex unless they feelabsolutely helpless.The one who wanted the slow strangulation was married with kids! Catholic. Sneakout in her car at night on some pretext and I’d meet her and using a cord anddoweling post I’d give her a 5-minute orgasm…but had I made a wrong move or notbeen skilled at the art of it then she might have been quickly dead meat. ButI’m excellent at mental/emotional compartmentalization. I like to be the bestand I like to take things to extremes. I hate moderation. I could ‘top’ a womanso neatly that I could have made a career out of it. [Smiley face] I had theoffer to do some from a FT madam. She told me I could pick my clients—allwomen—that I was handsome, sexy and perfectly in control, a rarity in the trade.I showed her a trick: I used one hand—I had hands like steel talons in thosedays—pressed her neck and she collapsed to her knees; then, just using pressure,I made her cream her pants. She was fascinated. I told her I could do evenbetter with a braided nylon rope…so we chatted and I got the job offer,referrals only, no House work. Of course I was fascinated by all that…and gotpaid for topping!…But I was in love with Teresa at the time, had a very nicenormal hetero sex thing with her, plus at that time, there were three freakwomen I serviced and within a year of marrying Teresa I’d quit toppingaltogether. I quit writing to freaks. Quit fiction. I was very straight whileTeresa was around. Turned over a new leaf. [Smiley face]So what’s to tell? I was into the sexual underground. The Freak Trade. [Smileyface] I did my thing, the girls did theirs and everyone was cool. It was thelate 60s, there were no rules as far as the FT went. I was selective, verychoosy…as usual. [Smiley face] I might add here that I do not suggest anyone getinto the FT. Avoid it at all costs because it ends up bringing only misery andproblems. 5/20/91. 1965: What I eventually had was a dual sex life…I had two fundamentalsexual base experiences…I admit I really did like the sadismo. Pure power iswhat it is. Wonderfully illicit. And there is the power of knowledge about howsome women are. I was taught to respect women—the Catholic thing—but there arewomen, plenty of them, who require total domination before they can enjoy eroticsensation. You can’t imagine what it’s like to really work a woman over; slapthe piss out of her and take a belt to her; call her filthy names and when thescene is over she says: “That was good…but beat me harder next time with thebelt.” It’s unreal.But success is vested in understanding the woman doesn’t want to be treatedrottenly on a regular basis. She has a need for the abuse sexually, and as atopper one must have a perfect comprehension of the scenario and the need oneach individual basis. The ‘victim’ must be able to say to herself: “I had nochoice. He told me to orgasm or he’d kill me!” I was excellent at creating anair of menace. But when the job was done I’d treat the woman with kindness andrespect. It was very weird. But always fascinating. By 1969 I’d learned to usethe noose and, of course, did death strap scenes with a few special ladies. I’dnever ever get into that scene again. I’d say I’ve mastered it anyway. I had itdown pat. 8/7/91. I’ve repeatedly told you that I will not agree to anything wherein I amportrayed as a SK. You are to STOP referring to me as a SK. It’s not true, andnot remotely provable. You want me to say I’m an SK so you can make money fromthe lie. I went along with the KBS to help you sell books but there is a limit.I’m in U.S. Court, my case is before the 11th Circuit and you want me to go onACA and be touted as a SK. Are you insane? No, I think it’s just greed.I’ve given you the opportunity to have the FU. I do sincerely believe you willsadly regret promoting that true story as something I’ve made up. You were giventhe chance to go with the truth but you encourage me to participate in a lie. Iwrote you months ago: No more KBS. You seem to be unable to separate the factfrom the fiction…which is a damned shame.By even mentioning SK and my name in the same sentence you are not acting in mybest interests or in the interest of truth. You are supposed to be my press rep.And you’re using that position to generate suspicion of me as a SK instead ofthe victim of a FU. I find this particularly troubling since I told you long agothat if my challenge to the FU failed then I’d do a fine KBS for you. Somehowyou’ve lost sight of what we planned and now, right in the middle of my federalappeal, want me to be a SK for you. Explain how this is in my best interest,will ya? 8/14/91. I’ve told you time and time again not to refer to me as a serialkiller. You’ve left the zone of reality and gone into your personal fantasy landand that sucks. You never sent me that PP because you knew I’d never OK it forKF. You can just pull that bullshit right out or you and I are gonna have aproblem.The offending material is almost exclusively on page one so to make it easy onus both just delete that page: TSKWLM. It’s a personal reminiscence that has nobusiness in a work of fiction. It’s out of kilter with what KF is all about.It’s a fucking misrepresentation of the truth, unsubstantiatable opinion and anunacceptable intrusion into my personal life; a truly cheap violation ofpersonal privacy both my own and that of my family.So you get it the fuck out of there, you hear? You’ve got your fucking nerveeven mentioning my family in a book of fiction. You clearly lead the reader tobelieve that KF is not fiction but factual accounts of real crimes committed byme. Are you working up a new reputation as a cheat & a liar & a whore so you’llfit into the business world better?Too fucking lazy and disinterested in fact to go read official records thatwould show I’m not in any actual way connected to two dozen dead or missingwomen. Nope. You sure don’t want truth lousing up your tidy, malignant,pre-conceived notions that I did all Stone claimed and more. Where’s the truth,Sondra? That was the entire base of the whole project: Let’s get to the truth.What you are engaged in at the moment is spreading lies and strengtheningmisconceptions.The alternative to getting back to what is honest and true is this: We fold upthe MQ tent. You go your way, I go mine and no hard feelings either way. It alsomeans all things GJS are halted now and forever. No more sales, no moreprintings, no more nothing. I’ll have Gary drive up there and the two of you cancarry all my drafts and other materials to the city incinerator and burn it. Allof it. After that if you print anything or indulge in any actions that can beconstrued as an attack on myself or more importantly, my family, then we canhave a war and I’ll respond in a manner that will let you know that you don’tfuck with my family.You have become uncommunicative with me. This non-communication started aroundMay. It’s almost as if you’ve said to yourself: “Since he won’t write me somejuicy KBS I can push as SK-Fact what I’ll do is market KF/BKF as fact thinlydisguised as fiction,” or “Since he won’t agree to TSKWLM on ACA I’ll just fixhim by putting it in KF—fuck him!” You pulled this sneaky shit and never evenwrote and asked me about it so, knowing you’re not a goddamned idiot I figurewhat you’re doing is pulling some smart-assed whore’s trick.You don’t need me to caution you about what I’ll do if you continue to publishblatant falsehoods about me as a SK or if you ever print any other negative orembarrassing items about my family.Hey, you have a little family so you can appreciate my sensitivity andprotectiveness.I’m puzzled as why you want to pull all this rotten stuff on me. I’ve even toldyou that I’d give you a True Crime’ book after you make an honest effort tocheck out he FU, /f the habeas fails. I’ve promised you win-win but for somereason you want to dismiss the truth and run with the lie right now…It’s likeyou’re deliberately going out of your way to do things you know are going toannoy me…Oh, if you wanted to get my goat you sure enough did succeed. I’ve beenin a snit all day…so please, shape up! 8/20/91. I’ve received your letter of August 15. You violated both the wordingand spirit of our agreement when you inserted unauthorized material into KF.There is no doubt in my mind that you made that move in an effort to embarrassmy family and attempt to ruin my habeas corpus litigation in U.S. Court. Whatyou’ve done constitutes a personal betrayal and treachery of the meanest sort soI’m not surprised to see you want to discontinue our project…I will say here sothat there is no misunderstanding later: Should I learn you are representing meto any one as a serial killer or sexual psychopath or maniac of any type then Ishall make every effort available to me to destroy yourself and your daughter.I’m not referring to murder. I am referring to ruin. And if warranted, pain.Simply stated: If you continue to attack me then you’ll get it back ten timesover. 8/24/91. As I’ve said in my last message, if you call me a serial killer orcontinue to attack me or my family then, and only then, will I move against youand your family. You see, it’s up to you. Your choice entirely. I’ll find out ifyou do something against me, or them. So just don’t do it and you and I won’thave a problem. I’m not a sneak. The day I set out to come after you I’ll tellyou and I’ll even tell you why…You really need to sit yourself down and think.I’m in the worst prison in the entire country. I have people in here who owe mefavors and any of your police or lawyer pals will confirm that if someone wantsto nail you they can do it. Drive up from Miami, do the evil deed, return thenext day. There are professional criminals in here who can have this doneeasily. You can’t protect against it. You know that I speak true.Treacherous, two-faced, double-dealing whores are not my favorite people. Shit,you’re as bad as Elton…who is so scared he went into Federal Court and liedunder oath. I’ll break him. I’ll never quit. Never. He carries a gun; so doesTeresa.I haven’t even made my move on him yet and he carries a gun! Will he carry twowhen his face gets broken? Traffic dispute. Happens everyday down here. Don’t benaive, OK? I can’t get things done fast from solitary but I do manage. 10/22/91. I’d like you to avoid calling me an SK and do emphasize that itappears to be a FU…If I lose in Court—and I haven’t lost yet—then you can marketme as an SK and it won’t matter. I’ll tell you when. But either way you win.Don’t you think so?11/17/91. Now I know who the Sex Beast is. How about that! Nice job on theresearch, kid.I can see where you’re having money problems so I’m gonna give you a chance tomake some cash…Go to ACA and get your fee…I’ll cooperate…Let’s quit bickeringand go out and make money!I love to terrorize you and drive you to drink but it’s no fun when you are sodown, so I’m gonna give you a break and, if you want to have a truce then we’llrun with this new thing and later after it spins down I’ll terrorize you somemore.If you are a good girl I’ll let you wear your official Serial Killer Death HeadRing on national TV…Chop-Chop! Write Soon, John 11/27/91. I am aware that you are more interested in my unusual experiences inthe sexual underworld than you are in my being framed for murder. CW was asexual disaster area who couldn’t come unless she was literally slapped intoinsensibility, her clothing actually ripped off her back and her ass; all thewhile hearing what a dirty little wet assed bitch she was, a rotten little sexslut on her way to Hell, etc. etc. After a few years of that I knew my wayaround masochistic females. That’s not my erotic tastes personally but I wasinterested in it academically. I have an inquisitive nature and I learned togive certain select females what they couldn’t get elsewhere: An expert topperwho was so cool they could feel the chill. A rare bird. Most partners are intothe sadismo role and get off on it or go too far. I’m into control, the greaterdiscipline. You can’t appreciate any of this because you are not involved init…It’s like FBI-H studying people who die during autoerotic asphyxia. He sees ascene but does not comprehend what he’s seeing.He doesn’t know the R&R (ropes & rituals) so he guesses at it. Show me 50 photosof women who committed “suicide” by hanging and I could easily pick out thosewho died due to having an inexperienced partner swinging them. Yes, if a gal hasan unskilled playmate she does die. There’s a proper way to go about it. I knowall about it. You see, most men are sexually greedy. Not me. I made topping anart form. I made a study of it and I had some women who dearly appreciated myskill. You don’t know enough to know I was into it but writing about it in aletter doesn’t get either of us anywhere. What I should do is write a primer onhow to hang a freaky chick for her maximum pleasure. That’d sell, but youwouldn’t publish it due to sexism, or something.I won’t mention that I’ve had to keep my foot in your ass to bounce you down theone true road; that you’ve had me so angry and frustrated that I’ve threatenedto wring your neck, none of that goes public…I want out. You want a job andsecurity. It’s not at all incompatible and we can achieve these goals workingtogether on this. Please abandon this kick you’re on about threats and fear.I’ve told you and told you: do not portray me as a SK. Now is that hard tofollow?19921/15/92. (1) ACA: I can’t really comment…reactions are coming in…they are 100%of the opinion that ACA trashed me…(2) Mike Newton: I had a letter from him.Answered it. I think he is qualified to run with the TS so I’m tentativelyagreeable…I’m cognizant of the fact that people say ACA & SL fucked me over butI’m not the type to listen to what people say and act on it. 1/19/92. You particularly need to warn Raymond Null about any use of my workwithout MQ authorization or any implication that my fiction is fact and notfiction because if he should make that claim I’ll have him in Court and make himprove it. I’ll even handle the case myself and I’ll make him go broke on thecopying fees for the discovery and the interrogatories alone. I know over 100expensive nasty legal tricks. Do warn him. I love to sue. Absolutely love it.You should have ACA do a second episode. The initial airing seems to havefocused on the accusations against me and the second airing might well focus onthe physical evidence that counters those accusations and lends credence to myclaim of being framed. Maybe get MN in there to announce he is going toinvestigate the case as a journalist/true crime writer. Stir up the controversybut angle it into the question as to whether what I claim could be true. Thelawyer-wife romance, all that…Should ACA do a second episode then the value willgo up on the books and story. Again, controversy. 1/28/92. I’ve always been a creative writer and such people are often regardedby the rank & file as being weird characters. You’ve been having the problem ofassuming too much, such as my fiction rises from my life, such as KF/BKF is allor partially true. It’s a common trap people who are not similarly skilled increative writing fall into. What I write has nothing to do with me personally,it’s fiction; although I’ve experimented with you and found that I can writevirtually anything of a negative nature, tell you it’s factual and you’llbelieve it in a flash. A good example is when you told me you didn’t believe Iwas a SK and I told you I could convince you that I am via my writing andpersonality conveyed via the written word. I simply used your own notions andimagination against you. I changed your mind using my writing talent and youstill don’t even realize that it was an exercise in writing for me and has not athing to do with actual reality. You ignore facts and twist suppositions andconjecture to fit the notion you want. You are willing to twist my fiction intoyour own speculative reality and the moment I say, “You’re right, it’s allfact,” you’ll simply accept that as gospel and never require any proof at allbeyond the stories themselves. I just can’t be a fiction writer, can I? You needa monster. Adios. 1/30/92. There is something maybe you don’t understand. I’ll explain it: Ifight. Nobody is gonna steal my manuscripts and use them to make a buck or printthat I’m a SK in 1992 without getting sued by me. That includes Null, Norris,Newton, you or anyone else. New Year, new policy. Now I do realize that Iprobably won’t win money but I can cost my adversary a hell of a pile of moneyin legal fees. Null is “on notice.” He can be smart, like PK was smart, and dropit, or he can learn first hand what a vicious, single minded litigator I can bebecause I’ll not only sue him, I’ll have him arrested on a formal criminalcomplaint…and I’ll make it stick—maybe. I’ll try…hard.…I’ve trained myself to learn how to fight a legal war instead of asking one ofthe dudes from the Satan’s Disciples Nation to arrange something violent. I’m onthe very worst FSP population wing with the baddest of the bad but I help thenigs with their legal shit and that gets me accepted. Quite a few of these dudesare with gangs and I’ve got some with good contacts to Yankee urban gangs suchas The Vice Lords, the Latin Kings, El Ruken, and Satan’s Disciples Nation. 2/17/92. I care a lot. That’s why I’ve told you that if you even try to rip meoff or tell people I’m a SK then I’m gonna be your serious enemy. I really don’twant to be that so I’ve given you ample warnings. You just blabber on about“threats” and never see the truth and light and reality.I’ve told you many times that I don’t care if the TS is written or not. But if aTS is to be done then it will be done right, and anyone who thinks they can ripoff my TS under “public record” is gonna be sued and sued and sued. Engrave itin blood upon your heart of hearts: I shall not tolerate any cheap ass TSbullshit story a la JN. And the only reason JN and his publisher isn’t sued nowis because you asked me to hold off on it. I’ll have his fucking book taken offthe market or die trying. And I’ll cost him a ton of money. You think I can’t?Or won’t? You just watch me. Piss me off a little more.Now let me give you the word here: If you want to do a TS about me then we’llcome to some sort of contract agreement and do it. Me, you, MN. And if you don’twant to do that then I’m gonna say to you here: Forget a GJS TS. And if you wantto challenge me, fine. I’ll rip your fucking heart out in legal actions. 2/19/92. Bottom line: We need a simple contract. Good communication. A scheduleand a plan. You do not want me for an enemy. And you’d be in a good spot if youhad the TS rights because there’s more to come on the TS. For instance: If Ilose in US Court I’m gonna have Schwarz, Teresa & Dean crippled. Arms and legs.But here’s the interesting part. I’m gonna admit it was me who had it done. Makethem charge me. Then tell why on the record, in Court. A bold stroke. But it’sconsistent with my determination to expose the FU. I’m not gonna tolerate theirdoing this to me.I’ve said from the beginning that I wanted us both to benefit by ourassociation.I see now where you are consumed by greed and want it all and seem to think I’mtoo pussy to make a move on you. I’m not. Don’t try me. Are you listening? I canhave a nice young vicious Negro fella knocking at Beau’s door within 30 days.Dare me to do it? Think I’m kidding?You’ 11 also recall that I went on ACA so you could save your home. A gesture ofpersonal concern and kindness for you and your kid. You assured me that ACAwould be balanced and fair and talk KF & FU…ACA made me look like a SK whowrites about his crimes. Hey, that’s your angle, isn’t it! I tried to help yousave your home and you took the opportunity too make me look like an animal.You’re a real prize, aren’t you?ACA did generate a lot of interest in the case. I’ll say that was a fact. I’vehad some interesting mail from book writers, film makers, etc. So there’s a lotgoing on. Nobody else has a great passion to present me as a SK; only you. Otherpeople have a tendency to deal with the facts as opposed to your inclination tospeculate about unknown and unnamed victims. 4/4/92. You are not to mention my name or work to anyone anywhere. Close up shopon all things GJS. Cease sales, promotions, interviews and conversations on allthings GJS…Don’t even send out for any new print runs…I am not going to beinterviewed…unless the interview concerns the FU and falsified trial evidence…You can either stop…or we can go to war…I’ll keep everyone tied up in Court fora long time to come because I have plenty of time to sit here and do litigation.Now are you gonna stop and wait until I’m done in Court or are you gonna fightme? You decide. Just be aware that if you want to fight I won’t quit until youare ruined…Better let MN know he can’t use KF too. Best course for him is go dosomething else. 4/12/92. I saw ACA…and we’re through. I don’t even have to tell you anotherword, do I? Seeing is enough. I’m not gonna argue legalities with you. I’m justgonna ask you to be a nice lady and pack up everything GJS into some boxes. Sealthem and send them to Mom…I want to be nice about this break so there are noevil feelings between us because if I get evil I’m gonna come after you and ruinyou. I’m still angry about that ACA presentation and I saw it a week ago. What Ishould do is come after you. But what I’m gonna do is give you proper warning tocease and desist all things GJS-MQ; and from this day forward don’t you evermention my name again. Are we gonna have a problem with that? You let me knowright away because if we are gonna fight I’m coming after your ass fast. If weare gonna have peace that’s best and will save us both a lot of trouble. I justwant to make it perfectly clear that I will not write another word of fictionfor MQ, Paul Dinas or anyone else; not at any price and if you so much as sellone more KF or even mention my name in connection to an interview or the printedword or anything else I’ll come after you and hound you into your grave andnever quit.You’ll become my life’s work.How I feel about ACA’s presentation transcends mere anger. You’ve tapped a BlackHole of genuine rage and it’s focused on you, I do have that hostilitycompartmentalized enough to act with cool premeditation, and we did have somegenuine fun; so let me issue a polite word of caution here…I’m in a state ofmind that I won’t need much of a push to come after you, so do the conservativeand wise thing and go along with me the easy route. Can we do that?What made me sort of sad was that you could have broken a genuine FU story.Even ACA could have…I invited them to do just that. But no, you chose toinsinuate I’m a SK. I do understand that is the more potentially lucrativeposition. “SK Writes ‘How To’ Book on Murder.” Well, you sure did fuck it up foryourself going that route. You chose to insinuate a lurid lie when truth wouldhave served you far better. I’m always on your case about that penchant for thenegative aspect you seem to relish. No more though. We’re finishedprofessionally. 4/16/92. Please contact Mike Newton and have him return to you all the materialyou’ve sent him concerning myself and my case. You may send all that down to Momalong with the stuff you have about me now in your possession…Will you do that?Also be advised that I’ve been made aware that your buddy Hazelwood haspublished some material referring to me as a serial killer and a sadist. Care tocomment? I gave you ample warning about what would occur if you continued topresent me to people as a SK.Thanks to you I’ve met a number of people from the Satanist underground. Toexpress my appreciation for what you said on AC A I’ve explained to them aboutyour daughter. They’ll probably get in touch with her personally through theirpeople in Georgia. Sondra, if you so much as even mention my name to anyone inany manner whatsoever, I’m going to use every shred of influence at my commandto have your kid picked up. She’s just right for these people.What you need to do without any further delay is to get out of my life. I’mgoing to endure you only long enough to get this matter settled and after that Idon’t want to have any contact with you ever again either directly orindirectly. I’m not going to argue with you about this. I’ve made my decisionbased on what I’ve seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears. Just neverspeak my name to anyone, anywhere ever again. That will suffice. Nothing less.If you want to make an issue of this then the kid is gonna be the one to pay thetab. Am I clear?Now let’s part like reasonable, sensible adults so we have no future conflict atany level. Just do the simple things I’ve asked and do them as promptly aspossible. I truly loved you at one time and do not want to cause you grief sotake this opportunity I’m offering you to get out quickly and cleanly. Go fryother fish and make sure my name doesn’t come up. Are we in agreement? Let meknow. 4/24/92. I’m poised to sue everyone—articulately. I may not win but I’ll breakeveryone’s bank and make the lawyers richer. I can do it and I shall do it if Isee it’s necessary. Then there is the matter of my being a part of a separatesociety and our laws are different than your laws, all of which I explained toyou in great detail. You seem to think I’m blowing hot air. I’m not. When I putthings in gear shit happens. Why? Because I have the necessary criminalconnections. I get things done because in my world people exchange services. Iwant to show you I have the people on call to implement any nastiness I elect tobecome involved with.…Pay attention, Girl: I gave you a $GOLDEN$ opportunity to plug in on a. uniquesituation. The FU of a crime/horror writer. Author FU using his art/prose asinculpatory evidence. But you never made that effort. ACA had the samechance…but no…they preferred to spin a web of insinuation that fostered alie…Shame! Shame! And what’s even worse for you is that now you’ve lost mytrust. You led me to believe ACA was a good presentation. It’s not, and you areabundantly aware of that. My mail bears out that the viewers were led to believethe book portrays actual acts; not fiction. What your pal FBI-H is nowpublishing also bears out that he has been influenced by what you’ve done in anegative manner. It would now seem I’m down as a SK and a sadistic sex-killer.How very interesting. What does he base all that on?You don’t seem to understand when I ask you nice so I need to let you know Ihave other ways available. I wouldn’t kill you. I can make life a real tormentfor you though. But my preference would be that you come on down here so that wecan talk it over and not have this awful thing between us.You need to rest and put it all to one side and work a real job. There are quitea few very new and important developments in my case and I will not write themout but will, if you come down, tell you about them in person. I’ll even assumefor the moment you do not realize how destructive to my goals your recentactions are; that you are not acting with malice. I really do want to see youface to face so we can properly communicate about all these things. Maybe if youcan see my eyes you’ll believe me. 4/26/92. I get amazing mail. Psychologists want to study me so they can learnthe secrets of the SK. I ask where they ever got the idea I am an SK. Guesswhere? ACA. [Smiley-face] Then I have to spend time explaining what tabloid TVis all about: not reality. Then I get letters from people who’ve read somethingFBI-H write that says I’m a ‘SK-sadist-sex killer.’ I guess FBI-H has a list ofvictims and some M.E. reports that back all that up? Did he get it from ACA, SLor just make it up after reading KF? What do you have to say about that my dearold friend?Now would be a good time to inquire if you can be re-instated onto my list. Comehere and we can talk this over in person, if you wish. I am not going to changemy mind about what I’ve decided but I’d like to have a personal peace betweenus. Besides I have a lot of neat stuff to tell you about…I won’t write it butI’d tell it to you since you are involved, sort of. 5/12/92. Where you seem to have had a problem in the past is that you confuse myfiction with your reality. Let me provide you with an example: I told you earlyon that I was sufficiently skilled in my art to be able to write fiction thatreaders would believe is reality. I was even agreeable to show you how thiscould be done via a KBS program. Then there was the angle where if I lost inCourt, we could do a book of “Killer Fact” that would be fiction palmed off asfact because people will believe anything except that which they don’t want tobelieve. As a gesture of my own sincerity I’ll start by rescinding myprohibition against further sales of GJS writing. You just go ahead and do theorders that come in to you. I’ll do the French interview. You come see me hereand we’ll talk over a film deal. You / MQ have no rights to any of my work untilsuch a time as we conclude a new agreement between us; so don’t go around sayingyou do. You’d better learn to take me seriously because I do what I say I’ll do. 6/19/92. I wrote to you several times offering to meet with you to discuss ourdifferences. You’ve made no response. My conscience is clear. Under Florida lawyou’ve abandoned our Agreement and I’ve fulfilled my legal obligation byoffering you to revise it. You chose not to. The contract is broken and you’veno claim; so please do not whore after me about it.(1) I’ve sold the true story book. (2) I’ve sold the true story film of theframe-up. (3) I’ve sold “The Justice Now Newsletter.” Cash in the bank. Sondra,I gave you every chance to go after the true story. You didn’t want it. All youwant to do is infer that I’m a SK. Fuck that! Other people took what I saidseriously and are convinced that I am framed. The TS has been sold to a majorpublisher. I’ve got an experienced author on it who is a former journalist. I’mgoing to warn you one last time: The very next time you say or do anything thatcauses me problems, and that includes crying to me about what you threw away sorecklessly, I am going to encourage my dope addled Satanist pals in Georgia togo pick up your slut daughter and teach her some sex education. Thanks to yourpushing the idea that I’m a SK I’m getting plenty of weirdo mail; you’veprobably gotten some yourself. I know how to pander to weirdos and as you’vefound out: Yes, there is indeed a Satanic underground…and they do love younggirls. My offer is simple: You don’t fuck with me; I won’t fuck with your kid.Do we have a deal?I always say nice things about you whenever your name comes up. But I don’t likewhores and I don’t like half-breed teenaged nigger sluts; I know exactly what todo about them. We don’t agree. Will never agree. So let’s just have peacebetween us because the alternative is war. You want war? If so, fuck with me;you’ll get it in spades. Doubt me? Ask Sadie what happened when Goyo fucked withher and I found out, then ask her what happened to the guy who meddled withElen. I am sincere. Sincerely good or sincerely bad. It’s all up to you.19932/13/93. Hello Whore, the word on the yard is that the Queen of the Sluts was atFSP romancing Danny Rolling. Word also has it that Bobby Lewis is ratting outthe Slut’s main squeeze to the cops. The entire prison is aware of it: BobbyLewis and Sondra London are taking down Rolling. Dude name of Williams says theWhore is sexually mesmerizing Danny Boy while her pal, Lewis, pumps him and runsto the cops every time Danny opens his mouth. I was so right about you, Sondra:whore. Pure fucking whore. A whore and a rat. The word is that Lewis is digginghimself a grave. He’d lie on his own mama for a chance to get out ofhere…Valentine, you’re mine. Why you out front licking Rolling’s ego? I knowwhat you’re up to: money. You’re gonna get Danny Boy fried while you make a buckoff his misery. Right? Well, go for it! Just make sure you keep my name out ofthis episode. Should I find out that you say I’m a SK or see my name involved inany of this Rollings crap you’re at the center of then I’m going to put you andyour whoredaughter on my list of unfinished business. Williams don’t like youworth shit and he claims to have KKK connections. Me, I like you just fine,always have but if you cross the line and attempt to exploit me then I’ll becoming for you with something other than love in my heart. I’ve earned $3,000this year in out of Court lawsuit settlements. People saying I’m a SK. Say itbut have no legal legs to stand on. Don’t make the same error and you and I andthe kid will be cool. Go do Rolling. I know you’ll do him well. You’re a pro.I’ll give you a reference any time you need one. You are never away from mythoughts, Valentine.3/8/93. I’m suing lots of people now. I’ve sued six and already one has settledout of court. More suits are being drafted. Joel Norris is next. That cunt putme in a paperback. What a double-crosser. I warned that fucker; now I’m gonnamake him pay. I don’t make idle threats about lawsuits and stuff. Hey, go kickass in Court. If you need a deposition…I’ll help ya, Whore. 4/19/93. Hi, Babe. Remember me? I remember you. Do you recollect I told you tocease and desist selling my stuff and using my name in an exploitive andnegative manner? You are still at it and I am not very happy about it. I toldyou. I warned you. Really, I did. I gave you every consideration to bow outgracefully. I’m getting lots of mail thanks to you and I’m meeting some realsick types. They send me stuff. Globe for one. Lovely. You really played itQueen of the Sluts for them, didn’t you? Saw you on Geraldo. Must say you’redisgusting, a genuine whore. For the sake of the good times I’m gonna give youone last opportunity to make a clean break. Pack up everything with my name onit and send it to Mom; don’t mention my name again in your filthy business ofexploiting the victims of crime. Call Mom and settle up with her on the MQ dealfrom France. I know all about how my work there is being marketed there as truestories. I see your name going along with it too. You are a bad girl. You alsohave a slut daughter. Now settle up and keep my name out of your dirty business.I got your address from Danny’s pal, a pal who don’t like you behind your back.I know where you live and your movements. I’ll send some guys to talk thingsover with you and the kid. I’m at the end of my patience with you.Do you realize how many nut cases read Globe? People who want to write to a real“sadistic sex killer” because they are wannabes. All I need to do is point toyou and say ‘sic em.’ You know I’m not a suspect in 34 murders and you knowJessup & Place wasn’t a sex crime so why are you defaming me with that crap? Nowlet’s get squared away between us otherwise I’m going to do whatever necessaryto get you to cease and desist with your exploitation of my name in a defamatorymanner and imputing serial murder to me. If you don’t respond to good reason,I’ll start filing lawsuits. That’s an ironclad promise. Now what’s yourpleasure? I’m open to reason & peace & good sense…or whatever it takes. 10/14/93. I will be meeting with a representative of the New York Times todiscuss my criminal charges filed against yourself and Paul Woods with NewScotland Yard for Berne Convention violations under the “Literary PiracyStatutes”…and I’m just getting warmed up, Baby. You have my undivided attention.You are my project for the next 5 years… 10/19/93. Wouldn’t it be better if we were friends instead of mean old enemies?I’m agreeable to a peace plan. What’s your personal preference, peace or war?You know how I am, no quit in me. I’ll stay on you and run you into the earth. 12/5/93. [Schaefer was barred by the prison administration from writing toSondra London directly. This letter was addressed to Paul Woods, publisher ofKnockin’ on Joe, a British anthology of prison stories containing Schaefer sStarke Stories and an essay about Schaefer by Sondra London. Please note thatall of the frivolous lawsuits Schaefer mentions were dismissed, and his attemptsto have criminal charges filed likewise came to naught]I made it absolutely clear to Sondra London from the very outset that in myworld, the world forced upon me by my circumstances of having been framed formurder, that men live and die by the code of the underworld. We have no lawyers,we operate on a Code of Honor. I told her that if she violated my trust that Iwould strike back at her according to the dictates of my world, not hers. Sondraelected to violate my friendship and my trust. She has no integrity about her.She is without honor; she is a whore. I spit on her.I also made it clear to SL that I would never under any circumstancesparticipate in any literary project with other inmates. SL violated that term aswell. SL is a liar, a cheat, a fraud and a thief. I am a former street cop whois in open population in perhaps America’s most repressive hellhole. I am not ina protective confinement cell: I walk the yard like a man. My closest associatein this slimepit is an Anointed Fourth Prince of the Hand of Death who was acontract killer for the Mafia. He is serving a 125 year minimum mandatory lifesentence for crimes too revolting to discuss here. This man has gunned downmobsters from Miami to New York and can give names and dates. He is one of themost honest persons in this prison. All I need to do is ask this gentleman tohave SL and her kid murdered and it would be done. SL is alive at this momentbecause I choose to allow it.SL has put my name and my work next to that of Robert F. Lewis, who is perhapsthe slimiest rat in this prison. Lewis is at the bottom of the heap, a breathingpiece of dog feces. Lewis just gave testimony for the State to help put SL’sboyfriend, Rolling, on the electric chair. SL is helping Lewis to get her ownfiancé executed. SL is less than dog shit, dog vomit. She is vile beyondcontempt.This brings us to the matter of SL’s commentary about me. SL is a thief and aliar. Much of what she wrote in KOJ is libelous. I’ve already sued RobertRessler concerning what he has done to libelously impute serial murder to me.The case is filed in U.S. District Court. I am suing all persons associated withSL who have libeled me. Suits are already filed against Globe, Michael Newton,Loompanics, Robert Ressler, Joel Norris and others. This is expensive fact, notfiction.As you have noticed, I am a writer. The other contributors to KOJ are men who,while they do have a point of view, are not men trained as writers. “StarkeStories” are professionally done fiction of superior quality. SL used KOJ as aplatform from which she libels me. I am genuinely furious about this situation;I am outraged and I am within an ace of requesting that SL be shot. The scummywhore is to get out of my life because she is dishonest. Ottis Toole has moreintegrity than Sondra London, you can quote me on that.I made it clear to SL in April - May 1992 that we were through. I do not lend mygood name to advance the cause of persons such as SL, Bobby Lewis and DannyRolling. You cannot understand what I am saying unless you live an honorablelife. You will either grasp this concept or you won’t.Danny Rolling is a confessed sex killer of local college kids. The man is acoward who won’t even come out in population. SL took my work and used it topromote this vile scumbag who is valued only as a sideshow freak. DR’s draw isthat he is a malignant serial killer. Bobby Lewis is a rat who would be murderedif he came to population. SL knows how I feel about these slimeballs. I amrevolted to know my name is associated with them. I cannot adequately expressthe depth and enormity of my anger about this situation. A person in prisonoften has nothing except for his reputation. I have a good rep with the peoplewho count, whereas Rolling and Lewis are regarded as shit on one’s heel.I will not have anything whatsoever to do with SL and every time she putsanything into print about me I intend to sue her. I will also sue anyone whopublishes anything SL says about me in print which is even borderline libelous.SL is finding out right now that I mean what I say. I am trying my best to haveher arrested and jailed.My work is absolutely unique. It stands alone, and either survives or fails onits own merit. This work does not require a windy introduction full of imputedcriminal acts and self-serving justifications for publishing it. I don’t requireSL to explain my work to the masses or turn on me as a rabid bitch and imputethat my work is a product of my personal conduct.I will not be rebutting SL except to say that she is a liar, deadbeat, thief andwhore. Hopefully she’ll be dead before this comment is published. Good chance ofthat happening.This letter clarifies my position regarding SL.image [Images/290.jpg]199411/11/94.
