G. Wells began his final book Mind at the End ofIts Tether, written in 1945, the year before his death. It sounded like one ofthe Jehovah's Witnesses' doomsday prophecies. 'The end of everything we calllife is at hand,' said Wells, 'and cannot be evaded.' In the quarter of acentury that has passed since his death, there has been no obvious sign of the'fundamental change' that Wells foresaw. But no, that is not quite true. Therehas been a change, and a very important one: not in the conditions of life, butin the attitude of the civilized western mind to those conditions. It is achange that would have amazed Wells, and perhaps irritated him. For althoughWells could not have known it, he died in the last decade before the end ofscientific determinism. This determinism—the belief that the universe isbasically a machine, and that life is just a highly complicated mechanicalprocess—had reigned supreme for more than a century, and it seemed to have cometo stay. Its basic attitude could be summarized like this: 'Man has always beeninfinitely capable of error and self-deception. Now he has found a method thatcan save him from them—the scientific method. He must clear his mind of allpreconceptions, and then merely face the facts. Concentrate entirely on facts,and on drawing rational conclusions from those facts... ' It was a creed towhich Wells subscribed without reservation, and he could not conceive that itmight ever be changed or modified—unless the human mind should plunge again intothe errors of the dark ages. It was the creed that finally led him to thedespair of Mind at the End of Its Tether, with its feeling that man is ahopeless, incorrigible self-deceiver who is due for a brutal awakening...Victorian science said man had no right to false hope; Wells said man had noright to hope at all. He was saying that the human mind is so full of its ownimportance that it cannot get used to the idea that it is totally unimportant;worse than unimportant—negligible, almost non-existent. Wells had taken the'scientific attitude' as far as it would go; the pendulum had to start swingingin the opposite direction...It did—although the first signs of it would have struck Wells as absurd, a signof decadence. I had come to London, at the age of twenty, in 1951, and Inoticed, in bookshops in the Charing Cross Road, books with titles like ABuddhist Bible, The Myth of the Magus, Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa, The I Ching,In Search of the Miraculous, Worlds in Collision. Now my own training, insofaras I'd had any, had been scientific, and I was very much of Wells's way ofthinking. I understood that the scientific attitude is not basically just aspoilsport skepticism. T. H. Huxley defined the scientific attitude as 'sittingdown before the facts like a little child', and following wherever they lead.And I knew that this attitude can bring an almost mystical sensation of openingvistas, a universe full of extraordinary facts, all waiting to be absorbed intothe realm of human knowledge. But there are all kinds of facts and truths:historical, philosophical, literary, legal, religious, and I saw no reason tolimit my interest to the kind of facts that Wells regarded as the scientist'sproper province. So I borrowed the I Ching and the Malleus Maleficarum and theTibetan Book of the Dead and books by Montague Summers on witches and vampiresfrom the library. And it soon struck me that there is a problem here that Wellshad never taken the trouble to define. For example, Immanuel Velikovsky'sbest-seller Worlds in Collision is certainly a crank book; but not because hebelieves that a giant comet from Jupiter caused tidal upheavals and gave rise tosuch phenomena as the fall of the walls of Jericho and the parting of the RedSea to let the Israelites through. From the scientific point of view, Worlds inCollision and Ages in Chaos are full of interesting facts about some strangecatastrophe that tore mammoths and mastodons limb from limb and then buried themin black mud, about giant boulders in the Jura mountains apparently torn fromthe Alps. Frozen mammoths have been found that must have been frozen almostinstantaneously, for there has been no decay of inner tissues (they are stilledible when unfrozen). Any modern cold storage firm will tell you that this isalmost impossible for a creature of that size. To begin with, unless it isfrozen very rapidly, the crystals of ice that form are so large that they burstthe cells of the tissues, and the meat loses flavor when unfrozen; the Beresovkamammoth was frozen so rapidly that only the tiniest crystals formedthroughout.[1] Some catastrophe happened very suddenly indeed, and it is thebusiness of science to try to explain it. On the other hand, there is no realevidence to link these prehistoric mysteries with the fall of the walls ofJericho when the Israelites blew their trumpets. Velikovsky is a crank becausehe reasons badly and wrongly from his facts—not because there is something wrongwith the facts themselves. But a scientist who declined to read Velikovsky onthe grounds that he is a crank would also be guilty of prejudiced thinking.Velikovsky's reasoning may be shaky; but the facts remain. And it is not hispreoccupation with these strange facts that makes Velikovsky a crank. There isan emotional prejudice behind the choice of 'the facts' the scientist is willingto take seriously: a feeling that certain facts are 'good taste' and certainothers are bad taste. Quite unconsciously, he has come to limit his interest tothe kind of facts that fit into the kind of jigsaw puzzle he is good at solving.I was clearly aware of this as I read the I Ching or Ouspensky's New Model ofthe Universe. The idea of throwing down coins to learn about the future isabsurd and indefensible from the Wellsian point of view. On the other hand, likeeverybody else, I had observed the way that coincidences do sometimes form oddpatterns. I can offer an example that occurred only a few days before writingthese pages. Reading a review of a recording of Verdi's early opera Attila, Isaw a reference to a ballet called The Lady and the Fool, put together fromearly Verdi operas. I found this record on my shelves—I didn't know I had it,and had certainly never played it—and discovered that the ballet had beenarranged by John Cranko. The record notes mentioned that Cranko's other mostpopular ballet was Pineapple Poll, arranged from the music of Arthur Sullivan. Iknew I had this, so I took it out, and played it after I had played The Lady andthe Fool. At half past eight in the evening—immediately after playing therecords—there was a program I wanted to listen to on the radio; I switched on at8.25. The radio happened to be tuned to the wrong station, and a newsreader wasannouncing the death that day of John Cranko, whose best-known ballets were TheLady and the Fool and Pineapple Poll. Not a tremendously exciting coincidence, Iagree. But odd. I had probably possessed the record of The Lady and the Fool foryears but never played it; I hadn't played Pineapple Poll for years either, anddidn't know it was by Cranko. These were the only two records I played duringthe evening before hearing the news of his death.Wells would say: Very well, what conclusion do you draw from that? That someinvisible intelligence wanted to direct your attention to Cranko? PerhapsCranko's ghost? Or that there was some mysterious working of providence... ? No,I am not suggesting either of these. I merely observe that coincidences of thissort happen sufficiently often to suggest that they shouldn't be ignored.Science consists basically of observation of events that are repeated—whether itis the sun rising every morning, or a comet returning every hundred and fiftyyears. This is no place to discuss Jung's idea of synchronicity—I will do solater; at the moment, I would only say that if a 'chance' occurs often enough,the chance of it being pure chance soon becomes unlikely. I also note, inpassing, that these coincidences seem to occur more often when I ampsychologically healthy than when I'm tired or depressed—perhaps suggesting thatsome unconscious radar-system is in operation.As to Ouspensky—and his teacher Gurdjieff: they raise the question of crankeryin a very clear form. Half Gurdjieff's 'system' consists of psychologicalobservations of an acuteness that amounts to genius; he is on the same level asKierkegaard, Nietzsche and William James. The other half consists of strangeassertions about planetary levels, the 'ray of creation' and tables of'hydrogens' that are unknown to chemistry. This part of the system may haveprofound occult meanings, or it may be a homemade symbolism, like the mythicalpersonalities of Blake's Prophetic Books. A highly intelligent friend ofmine—and one of the most intelligent men I have ever known—dismissed Gurdjieffas a complete crank and charlatan; he was a humanistic philosopher rather than ascientist; but he was, it seems to me, slipping into the same 'fallacy ofintolerance' as Wells. Gurdjieff did not suit his preconceived idea of therational and logical; so he let his emotions guide his reason, and dismissedhim.The problem is that the humanistic rationalist blinds himself in complete goodfaith. To keep a genuinely open mind is a matter of tremendous difficulty. Wecan slip into a 'point of view' that imposes rigid patterns on everything wesee, and which makes certain things inconceivable. You only recognize it as amental straitjacket when you have got rid of it. For example, although I readMontague Summer's History of Witchcraft with pleasure, it seemed self-evident tome that he was a crank or a liar. No sensible person, writing in the age ofEinstein and Planck, could believe that 'black witches' were really wicked, andthat they possessed real powers. Summers undoubtedly was a bit of a crank and abit of a poseur; so it seemed fairly clear that he was pretending to believe inwitchcraft to give his book a 'new angle'.[1] Nearly twenty years later, whenwriting The Occult, I took basically the same view. So, for example, whenwriting of the curious case of the North Berwick Witches, executed in 1591 forraising a storm in which they tried to drown the king, I took it for grantedthat it was basically a case of hysteria, superstition and credulity. Yetelsewhere in the same book, I accept evidence that African witch doctors cansummon rain. (To begin with, it had been described to me by two friends who hadactually seen it: Negley Farson and Martin Delaney.) It only struck me some timeafterwards that I was being illogical in taking it for granted that the NorthBerwick Witches were innocent. Some aspects of the case are very odd. At onepoint in the examination, King James I declared the whole thing was a tissue ofnonsense. Whereupon, one of the chief accused, Agnes Sampson, drew him aside andwhispered in his ear certain words that he had spoken to his bride, Anne ofDenmark, on their wedding night when they were alone; no one but the king andhis bride knew them. The king was immediately convinced that he was dealing withreal witches. Why should Agnes Sampson have done this, when James was in a moodto dismiss the whole thing as imagination? The account of the case given byRossell Hope Robbins in his Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology (1959)takes it for granted that all were innocent, and praises the courage of theschoolmaster, John Fian, who confessed after torture, but later withdrew hisconfession and died asserting his innocence. But Robbins fails to mention theimportant fact that Fian was the secretary of the Earl of Bothwell—who, in laterlife, had the reputation of being a dabbler in black magic, and who had everyreason to intrigue against his cousin the king. When the king was sailing backfrom Denmark with his newly married bride, a tremendous storm arose and almostsank the ship; the witches confessed to raising this storm, with Fian's help.Neither does he mention that, on the morning after his confession, Fian told hisjailers, without prompting, that he had been visited by the devil during thenight. Robbins explains the confession by emphasizing how horribly Fian wastortured, his leg crushed by 'the boot'; yet Fian escaped twenty-four hourslater, and managed to get back home. (So Robbins is forced to the conclusionthat the escape was mythical, inserted by the chronicler to heighten the effectof the story.)Robbins could be right. But there is another interpretation. There is evidencethat Bothwell was plotting to kill the king, whom he hoped to supplant on thethrone of England. Fian was his secretary. Suppose Fian was responsible forceremonies to try to raise a storm to wreck the king's ship? Suppose the witcheswere not just self-deluding old hags, but possessed the same power as Africanwitch doctors? Suppose Agnes Sampson had some genuine extra-sensory knowledge ofwhat passed between the king and his bride on their wedding night and, havingonce committed herself to confession and repentance, decided to use thisknowledge to convince the king when he became skeptical... ? This version fitsthe facts as well as Robbins' 'martyrdom of the innocent' theory. In fact,rather better.Having reached this conclusion, it struck me that I was now appreciably closerto the position of Montague Summers, and that he might not be as dishonest as Ihad assumed. Summers does not deny that many innocent women have been executedas witches; he only argues that there is a tradition of 'black witchcraft' inEurope. I cannot go along with him in believing that witches really summoned thedevil—although I would accept that they might have summoned 'powers of evil',whatever that means. The truth probably lies somewhere midway between Summers'total acceptance of black witchcraft and Robbins' total skepticism.As far as magic and occultism went, I remained basically a skeptic. But in TheOutsider which I started to write over Christmas 1954, I expressed my revulsionfrom the determinism and reductionism of modern science. (For example, I hadalways disliked Freud's attempt to explain Moses, Leonardo and Dostoevsky interms of Oedipus complexes, castration fears, etc.) In The Outsider and Religionand the Rebel, I was more concerned with the problem from a philosophical angle:that two of the most influential modern philosophical movements, logicalpositivism and linguistic analysis, should regard questions of human freedom asmore or less meaningless. With Heidegger and Sartre, I accepted that man iscapable of expressing free will—and therefore of some non-religious version of'damnation' and 'salvation'. Having worked in factories, offices, restaurants, Ihad a highly developed sense of the futility of certain modes of activity, andalso of the strong feeling of meaning and freedom in others—for example, inself-expression (in my case, through writing), in travel, in romantic or sexualinvolvements. As far as I was concerned, a life spent in menial jobs was a formof damnation; while Rupert Brooke's lines about a smell' ... that fibsThe soul with longing for dim hillsAnd far horizons'brought a taste of freedom, of meaning, of 'salvation'. It was no good tellingme that these words express linguistic misunderstandings.But at the time The Outsider came out, in 1956, what I was writing struckcritics as the most old-fashioned rubbish—a sort of throw-back to theromanticism of Yeats—or even earlier, of Shelley and Blake. The success of TheOutsider was followed by an almost immediate back swing. The father figure ofEnglish logical positivism, A. J. Ayer, led the attack; in a review of TheOutsider, while Arthur Koestler dismissed the book as 'bubble of the year' (andhas since reprinted this opinion in a volume of essays, by way of reaffirmingit). The word 'woolly' turned up increasingly in reviews, particularly ofReligion and the Rebel, the sequel to The Outsider. Then there was another groupof objectors on political grounds. Most of my contemporaries in literature wereleft-wing—Osborne, Amis, Braine, Doris Lessing, Christopher Logue, KennethTynan, Wesker et al., and they advocated the importance of 'commitment',marching to Aldermaston, signing petitions against repressive regimes, and soon. I had no positive objections; I would have been entirely in favor of banningthe H-bomb or allowing Russia's Jews to go to Israel. It was just a question ofpriorities. I was interested in my own inner needs, and in the inner needs ofmen in general. That was my concept of an Outsider: a man driven by a powerfulinner compulsion to freedom, which might lead him to act in opposition to thedemands of society, to his own desire for comfort and acceptance by his fellows.In the nineteenth century, it had driven many of the major artists to an earlygrave; and most of the romantics accepted this as part of their basicphilosophy: if you experience this strange urge for 'dim hills and farhorizons', expect an early death; this busy human world has no place for you. Iwrote The Outsider because I couldn't accept this notion. I could see no apriori reason why Shelley and Keats had to die young, why Hölderlin andNietzsche had to go insane, why Beddoes and Van Gogh had to commit suicide. Or,for that matter, why Wordsworth and Swinburne had to drift into a mediocre oldage. To me, it seemed, quite simply, that most of them were too passive. EvenNietzsche, that advocate of war and ruthlessness, spent his life quietlydrifting from pension to pension. I believed that if 'the Outsider' could learnto know himself, and make a determined effort to control his life instead ofdrifting, he might end as a leader of civilization instead of one of itsrejects. But the answer was not to join the peace corps or march in protestrallies. And because I held this indifferent attitude to current politics, Ifound myself, to my astonishment, labeled a fascist. I didn't see the logic ofthis, and still don't. I assume they thought that individualism always leads tofascism—unaware that fascism is a form of socialism that exalts the state abovethe individual. At all events, I had to get used to a feeling of working alonethat was rather like being sent to Coventry. I continued to write books. Thesuccess of The Outsider meant that I was able to find publishers. But reviewswere dismissive, and in a few cases (such as Introduction to the NewExistentialism) there were no reviews at all.Lack of money made life difficult; but otherwise, I didn't mind too much. Afterall, I was arguing that the romantic Outsiders had been destroyed because theylacked the strength to stand alone. To allow myself to be depressed by theneglect would have been illogical. Anyway, I was too busy just keeping alive. SoI completely failed to notice that something strange was happening. The tide ofa century and a half was turning. I knew, of course, that there was increasinglystrong movement towards anti-reductionism in science. Since 1959 I had been incorrespondence with the American psychologist Abraham Maslow, who believed thatFreud had 'sold human nature short', and that the idealistic and creative partof man's nature is as fundamental as his sexual or aggressive drives. I knewMichael Polanyi's important book Personal Knowledge (1958), arguing that thescientist's creative processes are as inspirational and illogical as the poet's,and that this is true of all creative thinking. But it came as a surprise to meto learn that there was suddenly a new wave of interest in eastern philosophy,in romanticism, in magic and occultism. When I wrote about the novels of HermannHesse in The Outsider, they were all out of print; and, as far as I know, I wasthe first person to write about them extensively in English. Now, suddenly, hewas apparently a best seller. So was Tolkien; his Lord of the Rings had been a'cult book' since its publication in the mid-fifties, read and re-read by asmall circle of enthusiasts; now it literally sold by the million in paperbackon American campuses. So did H. P. Lovecraft, a writer I had first read in theearly sixties, and had written about in a book called The Strength to Dream in1962. When I first wrote about him, his books could only be obtained through atiny American publisher, Arkham House, run by Lovecraft's old friend, AugustDerleth; by the late sixties, they were all in paperback.As to the 'occult boom', it seems to have started with a curious work called TheMorning of the Magicians, by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, published inParis in 1960. This also became a best seller. And this in itself was a bafflingphenomenon. There had always been offbeat best-sellers, like The Search forBridey Murphy, Worlds in Collision, The Passover Plot (suggesting that theResurrection was basically a put-up job); but they confined themselves to oneparticular theory. The Morning of the Magicians (translated in English as TheDawn of Magic) had no central thesis. It moves from Gurdjieff to alchemy to theGreat Pyramid to Atlantis to the question of whether Hitler was mixed up inblack magic, and there are sections on Lovecraft, Arthur Machen and CharlesFort. The English edition is a few pages longer than the American; the pagesthat have been cut out of the US edition describe an experiment in telepathyconducted between the atomic submarine Nautilus and the Westinghouse SpecialResearch Center; presumably they were dropped because it was impossible toobtain the necessary confirmation from Westinghouse or the US Navy. Which raisesthe question of how many other items in the book might be equally difficult toconfirm... A fascinating book, certainly, but one that would enrage any logicalpositivist because its authors seem to have an attitude of blissful indifferencetowards questions of proof and verification. Although the English and Americaneditions have had nothing like the success of the French, they certainly playedan important part in the 'occult revival' that now proceeded to snowball. Smallpresses that had specialized in occult books for a limited audience suddenlyfound they were making unprecedented sums of money. Copies of works like JohnSymonds' biography of Aleister Crowley, The Great Beast—first published in 1951by Rider, England's foremost 'occult press'—and Israel Regardie's four-volumework on the rituals of the Golden Dawn, changed hands at fantastic prices. Witchcovens sprang up all over the place—until 1951 they had been illegal inEngland—encouraged by a book called Witchcraft Today by Gerald Gardner, in whichit was claimed that witchcraft—the ancient pagan nature religion of'Wicca'—still flourished more widely than anyone had supposed. Whether it reallydid, or whether it was Gardner's book that caused it to flourish, is perhapsbeside the point. In the late sixties, a seven-volume encyclopaedia ofoccultism, Man, Myth and Magic, published in weekly parts, achieved the kind ofsuccess that had previously been achieved only by cookery books and works likeWells's Outline of History. The works of every neglected Kabbalist, fromParacelsus to Crowley, began to find their way back into print.Now Wells would have said that the 'occult boom' indicates nothing except thatpeople are stupid and gullible, and there is obviously some truth in this view.But I believe it is far more than that. It is all part of what might be called'the new romanticism'. The 'old romanticism' dates back just about two centuriesbefore the occult revival; it may be said to have started with Rousseau'sNouvelle Heloise in 1760; and Rousseau's book is basically a plea for freedom:that a man and woman who are in love have a right to become lovers without theapproval of society. And all romanticism has continued to be an obsession withfreedom: the feeling that freedom can be found if you go and look for it. Itruns from Byron's Childe Harold to Hesse's Siddhartha and Jack Kerouac's On theRoad. The interesting thing about this new incarnation of the spirit ofromanticism is that it came so late. The old romanticism may be said to havedied out in the last decade of the nineteenth century, the fin de siècle; itslast avatars were Rimbaud, Verlaine, Dowson, Lionel Johnson, and those otherpoets of what Yeats called 'the tragic generation'. After that, there was areaction: back to realism, classicism, social responsibility. From the twilightsadness of Verlaine and Dowson, there was a plunge into a savage pessimism ofthe 1920s—Eliot, Pound, Hemingway, Huxley, Joyce. The writers of the thirtiesrallied, pulling themselves back from the brink; they wrote about dole queues,the war in Spain, social responsibility. Then came the war; and after it, asense of hiatus. Nobody seemed to know where to go next. The Americansociologist David Riesman wrote an essay called 'The Found Generation' about thenew generation of students; it seemed that they were no longer full of politicalidealism, like Riesman's generation of the thirties; all they wanted was a goodjob, a suburban house and a car.When I wrote The Outsider in 1955, it seemed to me that I was swimming in directopposition to the current of the times. Nobody was interested in Nietzsche andHesse and Nijinsky. Yet Kerouac's On the Road had, in fact, been written threeyears earlier and when it finally appeared, in 1957, it was clear that Americaalso had its generation of dissatisfied romantics who thought that freedom layjust around the corner—in San Francisco, or New Mexico, or perhaps in DeathValley, where Charles Manson's 'family' were arrested in 1969. Within ten years,the new romanticism had transformed the face of society in Europe and America;the students were marching and protesting again, and the 'Beatniks' (the namewas coined by a San Francisco columnist) outnumbered holiday makers in seasideresorts. Psychedelic drugs and marijuana also played their part in therevolution. In 1953, Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception had advocatedthe use of mescaline to produce 'expanded consciousness', but it was another tenyears before mescaline and LSD became as common as marijuana. An Englishman whosettled in America, Alan Watts, became the prophet of this new generation of'mescaline eaters'; his doctrine asserts basically that western man has becometoo aggressive towards nature; he must learn to stop 'running', to becomepassive and receptive. Dr John Lilly's important book The Center of the Cyclonealso advocates the controlled use of psychedelic drugs for 'inner exploration',and goes into considerable detail about the techniques for this 'journey to theinterior'. Carlos Castaneda's three books about his 'magical apprenticeship' tothe Yacqui Indian medicine man, don Juan, have all achieved the status of bestsellers; but, on close examination, it is difficult to see why. WalterGoldschmidt, who introduces the first (The Teachings of Don Juan) begins byadmitting that it is partly allegory, and Castaneda's accounts of his meetingwith the peyotl god Mescalito, and of his flight through the air when he rubshimself with a special ointment, sound like exercises in imaginative fiction.Castaneda's books are best-sellers because they express the aspirations of thenew romanticism so clearly: the desire to escape to 'other worlds', thesuggestion that drugs are a valid means to this end, the serious tone of thediscussions about expanded consciousness. But unlike the popular classics of oldromanticism—Goethe's Werther, Schiller's Robbers, the don Juan books make aclaim to be fact, not fiction; and this is most important of all. As 'imaginaryconversations with don Juan', their appeal would have been much smaller. Thedesire to escape has become more serious, more urgent, than it was in thenineteenth century; it hungers for fact.The association between Hippie culture and occultism can be seen at Glastonbury,a town whose small population (just over four thousand) is almost outnumbered bythe influx of Hippies during the summer months. The man largely responsible forthis is a shy, rather aloof scholar named John Michell. Michell's book The ViewOver Atlantis appeared in 1969; in it, he discusses the theories of AlfredWatkins, a Hereford businessman, first expounded in The Old Straight Track(1925). Watkins had noticed many straight tracks associated with prehistoricmounds (or lumps), marked at intervals with large stones; he assumed that thesewere the roads of prehistoric man. John Michell's first book had dealt with'flying saucers', and he observed that UFOs are often associated with spotswhere leys intersect—like Cradle Hill, at Warminster. In The View Over Atlantis,he suggests that these leys were 'lines of power' analogous to the Chinese'dragon paths', lines associated with the power called fung-shui, the ancientenergies of the earth. Certain leys link up St Michael's Mount in Cornwall withGlastonbury Tot and Stonehenge; all Britain is intersected with these paths,which were associated with some ancient civilization that was of a far higherorder than anyone has so far guessed. (This is his 'Atlantis'.) In a subsequentbook, City of Revelation, Michell expands this theory that the Golden Age ismore than a legend; that it really existed at some remote epoch, and thatinformation about it is concealed in coded form, in many ancient buildings,including Stonehenge. Two central conclusions emerge from all this. One is that,during this remote epoch, man was in spiritual harmony with nature, in the waythat native magicians and shamans (like don Juan) still are; the other, that manowed his knowledge, in this remote epoch, to extra-terrestrial beings. (This isan idea that seems to be in the air of our time; Arthur C. Clarke gave itpopular currency in his film script for 2001, A Space Odyssey, in which beingsfrom outer space land on earth, and leave behind a monolith whose vibrationshave the effect of heightening the intelligence of man's remote ancestors.)In the fifties, Michell's books would have been classified with 'the lunaticfringe' (as Watkins' book was), and would have reached the tiny audience whostudy the measurements of the Great Pyramid and the mediaeval cathedrals. It isan interesting sign of our time that they should have inspired the Hippieinvasion of Glastonbury. It seems unlikely that his basic ideas can have wideappeal; the form in which he presents them is too abstruse, often mathematical.But what certainly does appeal is this romantic idea of lines of powerconnecting spots like Stonehenge, Woodhenge, Salisbury Cathedral, Maiden Castle,and so on. The imaginative appeal of Michell's work is related to that ofLovecraft and Tolkien; but again, like Castaneda, he has the advantage ofpresenting his work as fact, or, at least, serious speculation.The occult boom shows no sign of letting up. If history runs true to form, itshould continue until about the turn of the century. For there have been magicalrevivals in almost every century for the past five hundred years. Towards theend of the sixteenth century, there was John Dee and a host of other practisingmagicians and alchemists. It skipped a century—the intellectual atmosphere ofthe age of Newton, Leibniz and Descartes was not conducive to magic—but the lateeighteenth century was the age of Mesmer, St Germain, Cagliostro, and the latenineteenth century was the age of Madame Blavatsky, Eliphas Lévi, the GoldenDawn. In terms of the number of people actually affected, the latest revival isthe greatest of all. For example, it is a curious fact that the best-sellingauthor in the whole world at the moment is Erich von Däniken, a German whoseChariots of the Gods?—Unsolved Mysteries of the Past, appeared in 1969 andbecame a bestseller; since then, Return to the Stars and Gold of the Gods havebroken all records. I say it is a curious fact because von Däniken's books saynothing that has not already been said many times by various writers. His basicthesis is the one we have already mentioned: that in some remote age, 'gods'from flying saucers landed on the earth, and helped create a highly evolvedcivilization, whose ruins can still be seen in the jungles of South America, onEaster Island, etc. His theses are fascinating, if not new; but the manner inwhich he states them is, to put it mildly, highly unsatisfactory. He gives theimpression of being unable to stick to a point, rambling wildly so that it isdifficult to follow the argument. There is an element of boastfulness whichunsympathetic critics have interpreted as paranoia. (Chariots of the Gods?begins, typically: 'It took courage to write this book, and it will take courageto read it,' both statements being patently untrue.) The style is ofteninfantile, full of jibes and jeers at his critics; speaking of a gold hemispherewith a circular brim: 'To anticipate fatuous objections, it is not a sculpturalrepresentation of a hat with a brim. Hats have hollow spaces for even the moststupid heads to fit into.' And in places, he displays a lack of logic thatamounts almost to imbecility. Describing a skeleton carved out of stone which helocated in an underground chamber, he says: 'I counted ten pairs of ribs, allanatomically accurate. Were there anatomists who dissected bodies for theprehistoric sculptor? As we know, Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen did not discover thenew kind of rays he called X-rays until 1895!' The mind boggles at the madillogicality: the idea that a sculptor would need X-rays to see a skeleton, whenevery graveyard must have been full of them. It is equally puzzling how hispublishers allowed him to put such an absurdity into print.At the beginning of Gold of the Gods, he claims to have investigated a system ofunderground tunnels in South America, 'thousands of miles in length', containingthe ruins of the ancient civilization for which the astronaut 'gods' wereresponsible. He even offers a map of the area in which the 'secret entrance' islocated, but since the area covered by the map is a few thousand square miles,it cannot be regarded as conclusive evidence of his good faith. Obviously, ifvon Däniken leads investigators to his tunnel system, he will achieve acelebrity that will outshine that of his best-selling books, and will confoundall his critics. But at the moment, it must be admitted that the chaotic natureof his books does support the view that he is a charlatan and a crank.But again I must emphasize: it is the presentation of the books that suggeststhis, not their subject matter. Ever since UFO sightings began, soon after theSecond World War, many people have pointed out that ancient texts—including theBible—refer to objects that sound like UFOs, that ancient drawings and carvingsoften show disc-like objects that could be flying saucers, and odd-looking menwho could be astronauts in flying kit. It is an unproved hypothesis; but to giveit serious consideration is not necessarily the sign of a crank.I was asked if I would care to write a book on the occult in 1968. It sounded anamusing idea. Ever since those early days in London, I had been interested inthe subject, although I tended to treat it as light reading. When I was inAmerica, on a lecture tour, in 1961, I bought paperbacks about flying saucersand allied topics at every airport bookstall, and I also purchased most of thebooks on occult topics issued by University Books in New York: Montague Summerson witches, werewolves and vampires, reprints of the books of A. E. Waite on theRosicrucians, the Kabbalah, and so on. Moreover, since an experience withmescaline in 1963, I had developed my own theory of man's 'unused powers'. I haddisliked the mescaline experience. There were none of the usual visual effects;everything looked much as usual; it was rather like being drunk, but with lesscontrol. For some odd reason, I had a strong intuition that the district inwhich I live—in south Cornwall—was once associated with witchcraft. I have nevertried to verify this; my wife can find nothing about it in books of localhistory. What interested me was that my mind seemed more intuitive, moretelepathic, as it were. I recalled that Jim Corbett, the famous tiger hunter,said that after years of hunting man eaters, he had developed a sort of sixthsense about danger, which he called 'jungle sensitivity'. I could understandthis. The mind has sensitive areas, rather like the nerves in a fish's sides,that register delicate pressures. Most animals seem to possess this 'sixthsense'—in The Occult I cited many cases; of the homing instinct in birds andanimals, of 'foreknowledge' in dogs—for example, how Hugh McDiarmid's dog knowswhen he is going to return home from a long journey, and sits at the end of thelane a couple of days before he is due back, waiting. Man must also havepossessed this same 'psychic sensitivity' in the distant past. But he doesn'tneed it in modern civilized life; in fact, it would be a nuisance. My mescalineexperience may have made me more sensitive, more intuitive; but it also ruinedmy normal powers of concentration. In order to tackle the complex business ofcivilized living, we must narrow our powers, concentrate on what has to be done.Intense will-drive and this telepathic intuition are incompatible. Neither wouldit be accurate to say that city life destroys the sixth sense; we destroy it inourselves.However, that is not the end of the matter. These powers have only gone intocold storage; they can be brought out again if needed—for example, if, like JimCorbett, we return to circumstances where they become necessary for survival.But there is another possibility. They may return as a kind of by-product ofanother kind of power, a power that man is only now slowly learning to develop.A dog may be able to sense ghosts in an empty house. But no animal couldexperience the kind of excitement Heinrich Schliemann felt as he uncovered thewalls of ancient Troy, or Howard Carter as he entered the chamber containing thecoffin of Tutankhamen. This excitement is based on what we might call 'a directsense of otherness', of other times and other places. It could be objected thatthis sense of other-ness is 'nothing but imagination', but a moment's thoughtwill show that this is careless thinking. It is true that Schliemann could notreally look into the past, to the Troy of eleven centuries B.C. But the words'Homer's Troy', which, for most of us, are merely words, suddenly became areality for Schliemann. Troy was a reality, and for a moment, Schliemann wasable to gasp it as such, as if he had been transported back three thousandyears.This is a point of vital importance. The mind possesses a power to focusreality. Everyone has experienced this on the first day of a holiday, wheneverything seems clearer and fresher than usual. In the mood of holidayexcitement, we seem to see things in sharper focus, and we also experience astronger sense of the reality of other times; if I happen to read somethingabout Michelangelo or Beethoven in this mood, they no longer seem remote figuresof history; I can grasp that they were real men, like myself. This power to'focus reality' is the ability to project a beam of interest. All creatures havethis ability—you have only to see the way a dog hangs around the house of abitch on heat to see that dogs can be as single-minded as humans—but animals canonly direct it at the present moment. When you take your dog for a country walk,you can watch his beam of interest switching from object to object—a rabbithole, a gap in the hedge, an old bone. If an aeroplane goes overhead, he doesnot look up into the sky; that is too remote. And if you meet a friend on yourwalk, and stop to have a leisurely conversation about a neighbor who died tenyears ago, your mind has gone into a realm where your dog cannot follow you; youhave, casually and without effort, directed your beam of interest to anothertime and another place.Human beings can not only direct their beam of interest to distant realities;they can direct it to realities that never existed. A novel like Wells's TimeMachine or David Lindsay's Voyage to Arcturus demonstrate this extraordinarypower of the human mind to evoke a non-existent reality as vividly as if thenovel were a volume of travels in Central Africa. And a man like H. P.Lovecraft, bored and dissatisfied with his life in Providence, Rhode Island, cancreate a fictional 'reality' that reveals that he has trained his mind to focuson a self-created mental world. What is interesting here is that Lovecraft led arather unsatisfying, unfulfilled existence; it would have been understandableif, like an undernourished child, he had drifted aimlessly and died withouthaving achieved anything. In fact, he learned to generate some of the'psychological vitamins' he needed by an act of imagination; in spite of athoroughly frustrating life, he managed to grow into a remarkable human being.This is as startling as if a half-starved man put on weight by imaginingfive-course meals. Man's power to direct his 'beam of interest' at distantrealities obviously has some fascinating implications; it gives him a new kindof power over his own life.This power is not yet highly developed in human beings. I have called it'Faculty X'; for it is, in effect, a new faculty, the faculty that distinguishesman from all other animals: the faculty that may be considered the real aim ofhuman evolution.But this Faculty X is not an alternative to the animal's intuitive powers. Mandiscarded his sixth sense because he couldn't afford to keep it; civilizationused up all his surplus energies, and he had none left over to operate a sixthsense. But Faculty X represents a new level of power over himself; psychicenergies are freed: it could be compared to the flood of manpower that occurs atthe end of a war, when the army is demobilized. Once again he can afford todevelop his 'psychic radar', his sixth sense. This is why I believe that, as mandevelops Faculty X, his so-called psychic powers will also increase—secondsight, telepathy, the ability to dowse, even astral projection.Why do I think so? My own psychic powers are certainly unremarkable. Mytemperament is basically scientific. Like Wells, I experienced a tremendoussense of imaginative release through the vision of science; at the age ofeleven, the atomic table of the elements struck me as more poetic than anythingwritten by Shakespeare. And although I abandoned science for literature at theage of sixteen or so, the temperament remains; it is ideas and facts that exciteme, and the process of fitting them into larger and larger patterns. Such atemperament is not likely to be very 'psychic'. I cannot dowse; I have neverseen a ghost; I have never had any experience of foreknowledge or pre-vision;and my few unimportant telepathic experiences are summarized in a couple ofpages of The Occult. But I still note that a kind of 'jungle sensitivity'appears when I am healthy and 'on top of things'.I can give an example of this. One morning every week, I drive into Mevagissey,a couple of miles away, to buy groceries and pick up our cleaning lady. Onemorning a few months ago—the exact date was 8 January 1973—I was meditating as Idrove in: by which I mean that I was thinking seriously, trying to deepen aninsight, to do with the way we respond to crisis. The answer came to me,accompanied by a sense of control and relaxation. The narrow lane that leads upto our house makes an acute angle with an almost equally narrow country road,and getting around this corner, without having to stop and reverse, is a matterof some skill. As I was about to swing into the drive, the thought entered myhead: 'Wait. The post van may be coming out.' I had no reason to think so, forin more than ten years living in this house, I haven't met the post van in thelane more than twice. But I went into first gear, and took the corner verycautiously—and the post van pulled up within a few inches of my bonnet. Twoweeks ago, the same thing happened again; before I made the difficult turn intothe drive, I had a faint, nagging discomfort, like a very distant bell—and onceagain, met the post van. I am not saying there might have been a violent head-oncollision if I hadn't had this 'warning' feeling; but some psychic radar knewthe post van was there, and was taking no chances. In both cases, I was feelingwide-awake, psychologically healthy, not anxious or passive.Having said which, I have defined the underlying theme that I wish to explore inthis book. Writers on the 'supernatural' have often noted that some mediums seemto be sturdy, healthy people, not at all like the usual image of the'sensitive'. Not many months ago, I watched Harry Edwards give one of his finaldemonstrations of 'spirit healing' before his retirement (at the age of eighty),and afterwards had the pleasure of a conversation with him, which he allowed meto tape. I was struck by his utter normality and 'factualness'; he looked, andsounded, more like a healthy farmer than a spirit healer. I was startled when Iread, a few weeks later, that he was nearly eighty; I would have placed his ageat sixty-five. Everything about him seemed to confirm my theory that 'psychicpowers' are a natural consequence of psychological health.Since writing The Occult, I have met three people who seem to confirm mysupposition that unusual powers may be a kind of by-product of complete'normality'; and since all three seem to me to deserve more space than I couldreasonably offer them in my second projected volume of The Occult, I havedecided to devote this short book to them; it should be regarded as a postscriptto the first volume.I have one intense regret. In The Occult I quoted Witches, by T. C. Lethbridge,on the subject of dowsing. Subsequently, I became aware of his other threebooks, Gogmagog, Ghost and Ghoul and Ghost and Divining-Rod, and I realized thatLethbridge is a very important figure indeed. A man with a thoroughly scientificturn of mind, he takes dowsing as his starting point, and goes on to develop aconvincing theory of ghosts and what he calls ghouls—unpleasant feelingsexperienced at spots where some tragedy has taken place. I sent him a copy ofThe Occult together with a letter asking him if I could come and see him; hiswife replied to say that he had died the previous autumn (1971). As a tribute toa remarkable man, I dedicate this book to his memory."},{"pageContent":"OneROBERT LEFTWICHIt was sometime in the first half of 1971 that the encyclopaedia Man, Myth andMagic—which was being published in weekly parts—appeared with a back coverheaded: 'Psychic Sales Manager'. Robert Leftwich, said the unsigned article,began to develop his psychic powers while still at school, and since adulthood,his range of psychic experiences has greatly widened. The article began: 'RobertLeftwich is a man of apparently limitless physical and mental energy. Heliterally bounds from place to place and from subject to subject with a vigorwhich is little short of astonishing.' His interests and accomplishments werethen listed: '... he is sales manager of a large firm of pumping and hydraulicengineers [and] also an enthusiastic philosopher, writer, antiquarian bookspecialist, dowser, archaeologist and occultist. In the latter field he haslocated and apparently exorcised a ghost in his own home,[1] developed powers ofthought transference and partial recognition, successfully experimented withmost branches of extra-sensory perception, and projected his \"astral body\"consciously over distances.' It quoted him as saying that he did not considerhimself unique: 'Anyone can develop his latent mental powers if he tries hardenough.'It was this that interested me so much. Leftwich sounded like a walkingillustration of the ideas I had developed in The Occult.By this, I do not mean I considered him an example of Faculty X. This is a pointI had better clear up immediately. Faculty X could be defined as a highlydeveloped power to envisage the reality of other times and places. In The OccultI cited a number of cases: for example, Arnold Toynbee's sudden feeling, as hesat among the ruins of the citadel of Mistra, that the intervening years hadbecome unreal, and that the barbarians who destroyed Mistra might suddenly pourover that horizon...Such an experience is not the prerogative of poets and historians. In 1960, Iinterviewed a lady who lived at 29 Hanbury Street, the site of Jack the Ripper'smurder of Annie Chapman in 1888. She told me an amusing anecdote of a youngwoman who visited the house, and asked to go to the lavatory; her hostessescorted her to the lavatory in the back yard, and stood waiting. She said:'From where you're sitting, you can see the exact spot where Jack the Ripper cutopen that woman.' The girl shrieked, jumped off the lavatory, and rushedclumsily across the yard—somewhat incapacitated by the knickers that were stillaround her ankles. Now she knew the murder had taken place in the previouscentury, so it was not sudden fear that the Ripper might revisit the scene thatmade her scream. It was a sudden imaginative vision of a murder that wiped outthe intervening years, the realization that she was looking at the spot that hadbeen seen by the Ripper and his victim.But this flash of Faculty X had to be stimulated by a particular set ofcircumstances—a rather sinister slum yard on a winter evening... Places aregreat stimulators of Faculty X. It is rarer to be able to achieve the same 'freevision' through reading or study—although all lovers of poetry know theexperience of gradually raising themselves into a curious state of freedomthrough the reading of favorite poems. This demands what Keats called 'negativecapability', the power to lose all sense of one's own personality, to 'open up'and become little more than a sensitive receptor.The reason this is so rare becomes clear if one accepts the concept of the'hierarchy of needs' or values, developed by the psychologist Abraham Maslow.[1]Maslow suggested that our sense of values develops in a certain order. A man whois starving can conceive of nothing more desirable than a good meal every day.If he achieves this, he begins to think about security, a roof over his head. Ifhe achieves this, he begins to think about sex, love, marriage, children. And ifthe sexual needs are securely satisfied, the next level of need to emerge isself-esteem, the desire to be liked, respected. (This is the stage at which menjoin rotary clubs and women hold coffee mornings.) Finally, there is thecreative level: the need to do a job well for the pleasure of it. It need not beartistic creation; it might be collecting stamps or landscape gardening. A womanwho is good at bringing up children might adopt children when her own are grownup, and Maslow would regard this as an expression of creativity rather thansexual (maternal) instinct. Now obviously, the true development of Faculty Xrequires a negative capability, an absorption in 'other realities' for their ownsake, which is unlikely to appear at any level of the hierarchy except thiscreative level. On other levels, it may appear as an accidental flash; but it isnot likely to be cultivated. (And note that the self-esteem level alreadypossesses a considerable degree of impersonal absorption—or can possess it; forexample, a rotarian might derive equal pleasure from the respect of his fellowrotarians, and from the social good that he does by his efforts.) So psychicpowers, even in a highly disciplined person, do not necessarily imply Faculty X.All the same, Leftwich's conviction that anyone can develop psychic powersappealed to me as an important step in the direction of Faculty X. And thedescriptions of his own powers, as outlined in the article, were certainlyfascinating. At school, Leftwich told his interviewer, he discovered how toavoid memorizing the whole of long prose extracts or poems. He would memorize aparticular passage; then, when the master went round the class, picking out boysat random to recite passages, Leftwich would will him to select him for thepassage he'd learned. As an adult, he had 'more or less willed himself into hispresent job'. Other powers he had developed included dowsing, astral projection,and the dispersal of clouds by an act of will. He tells an anecdote of astralprojection: 'The wife of a friend of mine was scoffing at the subject oneevening, and I suggested that she devise a test for me. She told me that she hada mole on a certain part of her body. If I could tell her where it was, shewould be more favorably disposed to my arguments. The following evening, Irelaxed and quite easily left the body and willed myself into her home somemiles away. She was in her bathroom, preparing to get into the bath, and I hadno difficulty in spotting the mole—she was extremely alarmed when I told her thefollowing day.' He added that while watching her 'astrally', the sexual urge wasonly stimulated when the Mind returned to the Body.The article went on to speak of his dowsing ability, and ended with a note onhis convictions. His religious leanings are towards Buddhism. 'Despite hiscomfortable surroundings, his personal life is almost as austere as that of aBuddhist monk. He is a strict vegetarian, a teetotaler, a non-smoker, and evenabstains from tea and coffee, explaining that any form of stimulant is capableof interfering with his powers. He also says that sexual excess can disrupt themind and cause the mental processes to function inefficiently—and that for thisreason sexual activities are best limited to occasions when conception isdesired.'I decided I ought to try and contact Leftwich. Although The Occult had containeda number of accounts of 'psychic' experiences by various friends—A. L. Rowse,Robert Graves, Louis Singer, Ronald Duncan—I had never actually met anyone whoclaimed to have positive psychic abilities, i.e. the power to make thingshappen, rather than simply experience them. Fortunately, Leftwich's address wasmentioned in the article—which said that his house is the highest house inSussex. So I wrote to him, asking him about this power to disperse clouds,[1]and whether he could give me a few more details about the techniques fordeveloping it. An answer came back fairly promptly—apparently he had read mybook, and was interested in the suggestion that I might put him into the sequel.He said that the dispersal of clouds was extremely difficult, but that it wasquite easy to demonstrate psychokinesis, the mind's power to directly influencematter. In the envelope, he included a small square of paper, which had beenfolded from corner to corner, and also across the middle—giving an effect like aUnion Jack with a St George's Cross and a St Andrew's Cross. He told me to foldthis in the form of a paper dart with four fins, balance it on a needle stuck ina cork, and try willing it to go round. He mentioned that it was best to tie ahandkerchief over the nose and mouth, so as not to breathe on it.I decided to try it. I folded the paper into a dart, stuck a needle on a cork,and put the paper dart on top of it, so it looked like a fairground roundabout.Then I tied a handkerchief round my face, cupped my hands round the dart, andconcentrated on it, trying to push the dart with my gaze, as it were. Iconcentrated 'till I was red in the face, but it didn't budge. My face began toget hot and sticky under the handkerchief. I decided to put the roundabout on myworkbench, which is waist high, so I could crouch below the level of the benchand breathe normally. That didn't work either. I put it back on my desk, besidemy typewriter, and went on with my writing, periodically looking up quickly totry to catch it off guard. It was all no good.It was the next day, I believe, that I tried again. Having wasted so much effortearlier, I now no longer tried to do it by sheer willpower. Instead, I tried topersuade it to move, so to speak. To my surprise, it began to do so. It was awarm day, with the sun streaming in the window, and it struck me that perhapsthe heat from the palms of my hands was causing warm air to rise; I moved themback further, so the fingertips were only just touching. Using 'imagination'rather than sheer force, I got it to stop and move in the opposite direction. Mywife came down to bring me a cup of tea, and I demonstrated it to her. I nolonger bothered about the handkerchief over my face, being certain that the'roundabout' was far enough away from my face not to be affected; anyway, mybreath was going downwards, below the edge of my desk, a foot away. As amazingas it seemed, it actually worked. I left it on my table, and practisedperiodically later in the day, sometimes not even cupping my hands around it.When I told Leftwich about it in a letter, he replied that the element ofimagining it moving was crucial.Some weeks later—in July 1971—I had to drive to Hastings, then to London.Crowborough lay on my route, so I asked Leftwich if it would be convenient tocall on him. He said it would. So, on a very hot Monday morning, I set out forCrowborough. I wasn't sure what kind of a person I was going to meet: whether hewould prove to be alarming, or impressive, or perhaps just a fraud. Somehow, Ipictured him as a rather quiet, pipe-smoking man—although I knew he didn'tsmoke.I expected the highest house in Sussex to stand alone on a remote hilltopoutside the town; in fact, it faced into a tree-lined road. It was smaller thanI'd expected, but very pretty, and obviously very old, built of grey stone. Thelawns were large and smooth. It was only about three in the afternoon, but Iknew he'd be home—I'd rung him the night before. He heard the car, which Iparked beside his own, and came out to meet me. A very rapid, firm handshake,and 'Nice to see you. Come on in.' I realized that the photographs in Man, Mythand Magic had bestowed a false air of repose on him. He had a way of talking andmoving rapidly, although without any suggestion of nervous tension. We wentthrough the back garden and into the house. His sitting room had an air ofpolished neatness. My own house, while not chaotic, is never exactly tidy; thefloor is usually covered with books, toys and children's records, and if youmove the armchair you are likely to knock over a wine bottle that has been theresince the night before. Robert Leftwich's beautifully tidy room made me feel alittle uncomfortable.I said I hoped he hadn't come home early especially for me. He said No, heusually managed to do a full day's work in half a day; and since his jobinvolved driving around and making calls, no one was any the wiser if he camehome early. He said most people wasted their energy; he always threw himselfinto whatever he did, and did it with maximum speed and efficiency.I talked about my idea of putting him into a book. He said he had also written abook—and promptly produced me the typescript—and asked me whether there wasmoney in writing. I said not much, and gave him a brief run-down on the moneyone is likely to make from a book. He didn't seem too downcast. 'How much do youthink I make?' Looking out of the window at his enormous back garden, I made aguess: 'Ten thousand a year?' He chuckled and shook his head. 'Just over twothousand. And out of that, I usually manage to save twelve hundred a year.''What for?' 'I intend to retire when I'm fifty.' 'And what then?' 'I want to buya caravan. Perhaps I shall go and live in France. I want to be able to spend therest of my life developing myself, working out my ideas, writing books... 'Somehow, it was difficult to talk to him about 'occultism'—although he had anexcellent library of occult books. (He is listed in various trade publicationsas a dealer; this, apparently, was a sideline.) Not that he was evasive. Heseemed to talk with complete frankness. He had a brisk, good-humored air, andalways seemed to be smiling.His conversation seemed to drag him along hectically from subject to subject.His accent was somewhat public school, and public school English has a slightlyexplosive sound, as if the words are being fired from a gun; Leftwich's nervousenergy emphasized this, so his conversation was like a series of smalldetonations. He is obviously a highly sociable man, intensely interested inpeople—he mentioned getting into conversations on trains with strangers severaltimes. If I'd met him casually, I wouldn't have dreamed that he was associatedwith any form of 'occultism'. He might have been a house master at Harrow. Andhis obsession with order and tidiness deepened this impression. He explained hisdaily routine: up at 6.30, shredded wheat for breakfast, a vegetarian lunch, notea, his last meal at six, a glass of orange juice at nine, and off to bed byten... (I may have some of the details wrong, but that was the generalimpression.}We talked about dowsing, and he explained that this was simply a kind ofoffshoot of this bask faculty to 'make things happen'. For example, he had meplace a coin under the carpet, on a certain line, while he looked the other way.Then he took a dowsing rod—two curved staves attached together at one end—andwalked across the room. The rod dipped violently as he came over the coin. Heexplained that I could place some other object under the carpet—for example, aletter—and that if he then 'dowsed' for that, his rod would ignore the coin andonly dip when it came over the letter. He also demonstrated to me that he couldmake the rod dip for everything but the penny; he walked across the room with ittwisting violently in his hands, until he stood over the coin, when it becamequiescent. I recalled T. C. Lethbridge's remark that everyone possesses thedowsing faculty potentially, but that in some people it is so weak as to beunnoticeable; Lethbridge uses the comparison of a portable radio, which will notplay if the battery is flat. The implication is that a man needs to have ahighly charged battery to be a good dowser. Leftwich certainly gave theimpression of being highly charged.His children came home from school—both under ten. We walked in the garden, andhe remarked, with characteristic frankness, that he doesn't feel he is cut outto be a husband and father; he is fond of his children, but doesn't feel he hasany vocation in that direction. This 'figured', as the Americans say. The reallyphiloprogenitive parent has a strong 'negative capability'; Leftwich obviouslyfinds the world too interesting to be negative. In a way, he made me think of ayoung dog on a country walk, intensely curious about everything, rushingbackwards and forwards. He certainly didn't look or behave like a man close onfifty.Altogether, I found him a paradoxical character, full of apparentcontradictions. The sexual asceticism is obviously genuine—the Tolstoyan viewthat sex is intended for reproductory purposes, not as a plaything. On the otherhand, he always has been, and continues to be, strongly interested in women; heseems to find them more stimulating than men because of their more naturalintuitive powers. His conversation is full of flashes of intuitive insight intothe workings of the mind, the function of religion, human potentiality; yet inanother way, his ideas seemed to be oddly materialistic, skeptical. In themanuscript he presented me with, there is a section on 'The Cause of HumanAction', and he analyses religious feeling in a thoroughly simplistic,'reductionist' manner. 'Many readers will insist that religious folk usuallypossess the quality of kindness as a natural basic attribute, but profoundthought combined with absolute sincerity usually reveals the true cause for thesupposed goodness. They undoubtedly appear most kind to onlookers, but theirmotives ... (frequently unknown to themselves) are fundamentally of a selfishnature.' He goes on to mention a man who helped an old lady repair her radioset; when pressed, the man admitted that he enjoyed creating a favorableimpression, and also enjoyed showing off his (limited) electrical knowledge tosomeone who would be impressed by it.One senses immediately a certain lack of logic here, even if it is difficult topin down. What were the man's motives supposed to have been—to entitle him to aclean moral bill of health? The old lady's son might have repaired her radio outof love of his mother; a kindly neighbor might have done it out of pity. RobertLeftwich's friend apparently admitted that helping her aided his inferioritycomplex. But unless he went into the house to steal her savings, it hardlymatters why he did it. Under the pleasure in creating a favorable impressionthere was obviously the sense of responsibility for a fellow creature, which iswhat is at issue. But even if he had repaired the radio wholly out of someneurotic compulsion, this still would not prove that there is no such thing as adisinterested feeling of responsibility for other people. What is interesting iswhy Robert Leftwich should want to insist that most people do 'disinterested'acts out of 'selfish' motives. The answer is fairly clear, and I do not think itis particularly discreditable to him. He is deeply and intensely interested inhimself, and there is no reason why he shouldn't be: he is an interesting man,bursting with ideas. He is also detached enough to feel a mild guilt about this.If all 'disinterested' conduct can be reduced to self-interest, there is no needto feel guilty...All of which is only to say that, in Maslow's terms, Leftwich still operates, tosome extent, on the self-esteem level. In fact, with typical honesty, he admitsthis. He is one of Maslow's self-actualizes who has not yet actualized himself;this, he explained, was the reason that he wanted to retire at fifty and spendthe rest of his life seeking self-enlightenment, deepening his insight,exploring further depths of self-control.When I left him, on that July afternoon, to drive to London, my feelings abouthim were ambivalent. I found him likeable, because of that child-like opennessand frankness, and the enormous zest he puts into living. But I could imaginesomeone who didn't like him finding him an intolerable egoist; and this, inturn, would probably lead them to dismiss his 'powers' as wishful thinking.This, I was fairly certain, would be a mistake. His dowsing abilities areclearly extraordinary; he has even demonstrated them in front of a televisionaudience. Obviously, he can 'do something' with his mind which enables him totune in to things that are beyond the normal human radius. When he came toCornwall, he demonstrated one of his abilities with both me and my wife. Hestood with his back to us, holding the divining rod. One of us was told to walkforward until we crossed a spot where we knew there was an underground pipe. Aswe crossed the pipe, the rod in Robert's hand twisted to indicate water. He had'tuned in' to our minds. At The Beacon House, he had showed me photographs andbusiness letters in connection with divining minerals from an aeroplane, and itwas apparent that he had been successful. There could be no doubt that hepossessed unusual powers. What I now wanted to understand was the nature ofthese powers, how he came to possess them, and their relation to his totalpersonality.At this point, I must temporarily leave Robert Leftwich, and speak moregenerally of the subject of dowsing.In its simplest form, there is nothing 'supernatural' about dowsing—any morethan there is about radio, or the way iron filings shape themselves along amagnet's field of force. Dowsing has been scientifically tested. (Descriptionsof experiments can be found in Sir William Barrett's book The Divining Rod(1926).) In 1968, Robert Leftwich performed under controlled test conditions ona TV program compered by Brian Inglis, successfully completing the first part ofthe experiment involving six drums, five of which contained salt. In the secondpart, he located three cans of water that had been buried in a certain area ofwaste ground. Although he converted a skeptic—Professor John Cohen—Leftwichhimself was disappointed; five cans of water and a knife had been buried, and hefailed to locate all these.T. C. Lethbridge asserts {in Ghost and Divining-Rod) that all objects have afield of force around them, like a magnetic field, and that the exact size ofthis field indicates the nature of the object: for example, a piece of brass orcopper has a field exactly 61 inches across at ground level. Lethbridge addsthat if you try to get above the field—by climbing on something—you cannot doit; the field extends upwards. He says: 'You cannot do so without a fireman'sladder,' and adds 'and perhaps you cannot do so then,' indicating that he hasn'ttried it. In fact, if Robert Leftwich can dowse from an aeroplane, it seemsprobable that the field extends upwards for a very great distance—although,admittedly, he was dealing with vast quantifies of mineral deposits. Lethbridgeremarks that the size of the object seems to make no difference to the size ofthe field; a brass pinhead or a brass coin would still create a 61-inch field.This again suggests the need for further investigation, for it seems unlikelythat a brass mountain would have a 61-inch field.The dowser 'picks up' this field, as if he were a radio receiver. In an article'More In Heaven and Earth', published in the magazine of the British Society ofDowsers, Leftwich suggests that dowsing depends on 'high frequencyelectromagnetic waves' sent out from the dowser's brain like radar waves. In asecond article in the same journal, he suggests that objects also emit waves,which are picked up by the dowser, and his final view would seem to be that thebrain can emit 'radar' waves and that objects possess their own force field,hovering around it like the smell of gorgonzola cheese. (I will discuss his mostrecent thoughts on dowsing later in this chapter.)Now this matter of 'fields' is of considerable interest, and it seems likelythat this will be the direction of the real breakthrough in 'occult' researches.In 1845, Baron Karl yon Reichenbach published a book whose shortened title isThe Dynamics of Magnetism. He was not discussing iron magnets, but the humanmagnetic field. Like the physician Anton Mesmer, Reichenbach believed thatmagnets {iron ones) might have healing properties. Neurasthenic patients—what hecalled 'sick sensitives'—were able to see light radiating from the poles ofmagnets—bluish from the north pole, reddish from the south. They lost this powerwhen their health improved. As Reichenbach tested an increasing number ofmaterials on his 'sick sensitives'—crystals, other metals—he found that they allseemed to possess a field of force. He called this force 'odile'; it becamenotorious as 'odic force'. He said that human beings possess odic force to anunusual degree, and it can be seen in the dark, streaming from the finger endsin the form of a light emanation.For a decade and a half, scientists busily discussed and tested odic force. ThenDarwin published The Origin of Species (1859). For a while, everything else wasforgotten. And as scientists had to defend themselves against attacks from theChurch, they laid more and more emphasis on the scientific attitude—i.e. onlybelieving what can be proved by observation. Reichenbach and his odic force wasone of the earliest victims of this new attitude; twenty years after thepublication of his book, his name—and ideas—had become a joke. Perhaps it waspartly his own fault for choosing a term like odic force; if he had called it'biomagnetic vibrations' or something of the sort, scientists mighthavecontinued to believe in it.Almost a century later, in the late 1930s, a cranky and slightly paranoid man ofgenius, Wilhelm Reich, concluded that the universe is permeated by a kind ofvital energy called orgone energy. At first, Reich was inclined to believe thatthis energy—which gave him conjunctivitis when he had been examining sea-sandculture under a microscope—was emitted by 'bions', pulsating living cells, whichhe had observed some years earlier. One night, looking at the night sky throughan improvised tube, he observed a flickering in the dark spaces between thestars, and concluded that the atmosphere is full of 'orgone energy'. His theory,roughly, is that this vital energy is present throughout the universe, and thatit can actually create living cells even in a sterile fluid. Reich constructed akind of greenhouse for concentrating this orgone energy—a box made of alternatelayers of steel and asbestos (i.e. metal and organic material). I myself havesat in one of these boxes in the study of Reich's brother-in-law, the lateRobert Ollendorff, and experienced a distinct feeling of warmth—although thewalls were cold—and noted that my temperature rose by three degrees in a fewminutes.With ideas like this, it was inevitable that Reich should be ridiculed by thescientific establishment. He was; not only ridiculed, but attacked andpersecuted. When he died in prison in 1957, he had become distinctly paranoidand was suffering from delusions. The general view was that it was goodriddance; he was a crank with messianic delusions, and was probably better dead.Now, nearly two decades after Reich's death, there is reason to wonder whetherboth he and Reichenbach had stumbled on something that orthodox science hadoverlooked—something as fundamental as Newton's discovery of the laws ofgravity.In 1935, before Reich discovered orgone energy, two respectable Americanscientists, Dr Harold Saxton Burr and F. S. C. Northrop, both of Yale, publisheda paper called 'Electro-dynamic Theory of Life,' suggesting, quite simply, thatliving things produce electrical fields that can be measured. And for the nextthree decades, Burr and his colleagues continued to investigate these 'lifefields' (or L-fields, as Edward Russell has proposed we call them). The firstproblem was to develop a voltmeter sensitive enough to measure very smallfields; but once this was done, it was plain sailing. The voltmeters wereconnected up to a couple of large trees for years, and they showed that theelectrical field of the trees varied between day and night, and with electricalstorms and sunspots. Animals were more problematic, since they cannot be made tostand still for years; but Burr soon discovered that there are variations in thebody's magnetic field when we are ill, when wounds are healing, when womenovulate. (This latter discovery apparently provides a more or less infallibleguide for parents who want children. And the discovery of body variations inperiods of illness indicates a method for the early detection of cancer.)In the sixties, European and American doctors became increasingly interested inthe ancient Chinese medical practice known as acupuncture. By all westernstandards, this ought to be unscientific nonsense; but it works. It wasoriginally based on the observation that when someone is ill, his skin oftendevelops 'tender points', and that pressure applied to these points seems toimprove the illness. The theory behind acupuncture is that the universe ispermeated with various vital forces—like the 'lines of power' mentioned in JohnMichell's The View Over Atlantis—and that the same vital forces permeate thehuman body, with definite crossing points like 'leys'. This vital energy iscalled Qi or Ch'i (breath). A television film shown in England early in 1973showed doctors performing operations that would usually require anesthesia, withthe patient fully conscious, and a few wooden slivers sticking out of variouspoints of the body. The patient was able to watch his own stomach being cutopen, see it sewn up, and apparently take it all very calmly. (Recovery alsoseemed to be incredibly fast—some patients were eating large meals a few hoursafter serious operations.)In Russia, acupuncture is used nearly as much as in China. And a Russianscientist, Victor Adamenko, developed a device called a tobioscope to establishacupuncture points. Adamenko's starting point was a device invented thirty or soyears ago by two scientists, Semyon and Valentina Kirlian. This consists of aTesla coil—a transformer for high-frequency alternating currents, used inradio—which is connected to two metal plates. Between these plates, anobject—alive or otherwise—is placed in contact with a piece of film, then thehigh-frequency current is switched on. The result is a photograph of the 'field'of the object. For example, if a newly-cut flower is placed between the plates,light can be seen streaming from the cut stem in the form of 'sparks', whileleaves and buds show flare patterns. Photographs of the human body show the sameflare patterns, and Stanley Krippner, an American scientist who examined thesephotographs in Russia (and wrote about them in an article in the SaturdayEvening Post, 18 March 1972), comments that they change if the subject ishypnotized, takes drugs or drinks alcohol. This suggests that they are nodes ofenergy. And since acupuncture theory has it that these 'meridional' points canbe blocked with too much energy, it seems possible that the camera is recordingsuch points. (Everyone must have noticed that some point of the skin maysuddenly 'prickle'—sometimes as if a needle is being driven in; you only have tostart thinking about this to get 'prickles' on the skin—presumably due to somekind of discharge of nervous energy, like static.)Obviously, it is no great scientific problem to convert the light energy—asobserved by the Kirlian device—into electrical energy, and this is what VictorAdamenko has done in his tobioscope. It is a kind of flashlight that is passedover the patient's skin, and which goes on and off as it passes over acupuncturepoints. If the patient is healthy, it gives a good light; if unhealthy, it isdim. The relation to Harold Burr's work on 'life fields' is obvious. (Forexample, sunspots affect the Kirlian photographs.) Kirlian photographs have beentaken of the whole body; one of Mrs Kulagina, an adept in psychokinesis, shows apulsating field around the body. (Mrs Kulagina is, apparently, able to moveobjects like matches and paperclips by passing her hands close to, them; StanleyKrippner reports that she has even made them move by thought alone.)It certainly looks, then, as though a century after Reichenbach, the reality ofhis odic force (read: 'field of force') is being demonstrated. Which makes itseem that dowsing, even in its odder manifestations, is as explainable as anyother simple wave phenomena. We simply need an Isaac Newton of this new field torecognize the underlying laws of the phenomena. I'm inclined to believe thatLethbridge has taken the largest step in this direction so far. In Ghost andDivining-Rod, he advances the theory that there are specific electrical fieldsconnected with water (including the sea), and with mountains and deserts; andalthough he chooses to call these by romantic names such as 'Naiad fields','Oread fields' and 'Nereid fields', he regards them as perfectly normalelectrical fields. He observed that 'ghost' and 'ghoul' phenomena often seem tooccur in the area of such fields. For example, he saw a 'ghost' at Hole Mill,near Seaton, and discovered that an underground stream connected the spot wherehe was standing with the spot where he saw the ghost. At which point, he makes afurther assumption: that his own 'psychic field' was able to pickup a pictureimplanted on the 'naiad field' of the stream by the 'ghost's' psychic field manyyears before. In other words, that the 'ghost' was really a kind of snapshot,imprinted on the naiad field by some intense emotion, (He suggests that intensehappiness can 'imprint' itself on 'fields' just as easily as intense misery orfear.) The same applies to the 'ghouls' he has sensed on various occasions—forexample, on Ladram beach.[1]In his book Design for Destiny (Neville Spearman 1971), Edward Russell, anAmerican journalist, quotes Burr's experiments with 'Life fields', and then goeson to cite the results of the Russian scientist, L. L. Vasiliev, professor ofphysiology at Leningrad, who performed a series of experiments that demonstratedthe reality of telepathy beyond all reasonable doubt. Vasiliev had two subjectssitting in different rooms; one sent out suggestions that the other should fallasleep. It worked. Moreover, it worked over immense distances—from Leningrad toSevastopol, and it worked even if the subjects were enclosed in a metal chamberthat would prevent any transmission by electrical fields. Vasiliev's extremelydetailed and complicated experiments were published in a book called Experimentsin Mental Suggestion, which has so far been published in England only in alimited edition. Mr Russell argues that these experiments prove the existence ofanother kind of field, 'thought fields', which he calls 'T-fields'. He goes onto state that T-fields can 'attach themselves to any kind of matter'. He isspeaking about Lethbridge's 'ghouls' and such like: 'Many an estate agent,trying to sell a desirable property, must have been puzzled and disappointedwhen clients exclaimed: \"Ugh, let's get out of here! This place gives me thewillies!\"' He adds that the size of the object on which the field is impressedseems to make no difference: it can be as large as a house or as small as apinhead. An observation that brings to mind Lethbridge's remark about theconstant size of electrical fields for various metals, and again suggests thatwe are here dealing with some general law concerning fields.Another important clue is offered in the book called The World of Ted Serios byDr Jule Eisenbud (which I have also discussed in The Occult). Ted Serios is analcoholic bellboy who has the extraordinary ability to press a Polaroid cameraagainst his' head, and somehow imprint 'mental photographs' on the plate. Thephotographs, many of which are included in the book, are usually of places.Eisenbud was shocked when he discovered that, although Serio's results seemedgenuine, no one was interested. He need not have been surprised. The problem isthat Serio's powers do not fit into any general pattern. It is like a piece of ajigsaw puzzle that doesn't connect together with any other piece. So, for thetime being, it is pushed to a corner of the table and left alone; no one isinterested in it until some interlocking pieces can be found. And this is againdemonstrated by the fate of the book; it excited a good deal of interest when itappeared; since when, it seems to have lapsed into relative oblivion. But someof the interlocking pieces may perhaps be found in Lethbridge and the Kirliandevice. The Kirlian device takes photographs of life fields, or psychic fields,proving they can be impressed on a photographic plate; Ted Serios can impresshis T-fields on a photographic plate. And,Lethbridge suggests, any human beingsmay impress a T-field on the electrical field associated with a certain area,particularly if that area has water running through it.I was already aware of the probable importance of 'fields' in explaining psychicphenomena before I met Robert Leftwich. So I found most of his ideas andtheories easy enough to accept. I had an opportunity to explore these further afew months after that first meeting. In January 1972,1 became one of thepresenters of a monthly arts program, Format, on Westward Television. In May1972, Michael Joseph brought out a book called The Table Rappers, a history ofspiritualism by Ronald Pearsall, who lives in the west country. Mr Pearsall'spoint of view is distinctly skeptical; so when I asked him to appear on theprogram, I also asked Robert Leftwich if he would care to take part. He agreed,and drove down to Cornwall on the day of the program. It was an interestingdiscussion. I asked Leftwich to explain about 'astral projection'; he said thathe could only do it at certain times, which seem to come around periodically. Hecan feel it 'coming on' for some days in advance. He described how, on oneoccasion, he had been sitting on the London Underground, feeling ratheroppressed by the crowds; so he closed his eyes—to look as if he was asleep—and'projected' himself out of his body. After a while someone noticed him; his facehad gone very pale, and he seemed to have stopped breathing. There was a minorpanic; but while the passengers were discussing what to do with the corpse,Robert arrived at his station, opened his eyes, and walked off the train...The story is typical; it demonstrates the element of schoolboyish mischief thatis a definite part of Leftwich's make-up. It seems incongruous; but this isbecause most of us have formed our conceptions about 'psychic powers' from fairystories; from the Arabian Nights to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, the wizardshave grey beards, piercing eyes and a basilisk-like stare. The truth is thatpsychic powers are almost accidental; their possessors may belong to anypersonality type. This is particularly true in the case of 'astral projection',also known as 'out-of-the-body experience' (and ecsomatic experience). Theyoften seem to occur by accident, if one can accept the testimony of those whoclaim to have experienced it. For example, in Out-of-the-Body Experiences byCelia Green (Vol. II of the Proceedings of the Institute of PsychophysicalResearch, Oxford 1968), a waitress describes how she was walking home in a stateof fatigue when she suddenly realized that her body was below her, walking alongthe street; a girl reading a book suddenly found herself floating near theceiling, looking down on her body in the chair; a man sitting on the seat of abus suddenly found himself on the stairs, looking at himself still seated. Thetwo classic books on the subject are The Phenomena of Astral Projection (1950),and The Projection of the Astral Body (1929), both by Sylvan Muldoon andHereward Carrington, and I must refer the reader to these for furtherinformation.I had been hoping to carry out some systematic exploration of Robert Leftwich's'strange powers' when he came to see us in Cornwall; but again, I wasdisappointed. This was not his fault. He seemed willing to discuss any subjectfrankly; but his ideas about his powers are bound up with ideas aboutvegetarianism, health foods, marriage, morality, and so on. So a question aboutthe first time he experienced astral projection might produce a discourse on hisdiet, childhood fantasies, army experiences or marriage.When I had been at The Beacon House, he had shown me the typescript of a 'book',actually a volume of essays, called The Philosophy of an Escapist; I had beenpuzzled by the title, until he explained that by 'escapist', he meant someonewho wanted to escape the rat-race and retire to a place where he could meditate.I had wanted to borrow the typescript, but it was the only one and he wasunwilling to let it out of his hands. Now he brought me a photocopy to Cornwall,and I had a chance to study it in more detail. I found it an immenselyinteresting document, which provided me with a great deal more insight into hischaracter; but as far as explaining his 'powers' was concerned, it was again adisappointment. All the same, it did provide certain insights. It was clear fromthe opening paragraphs that Leftwich is a typical 'outsider' figure. 'The ideaof settling down away from the influences of modern civilization and itsappalling artificiality originated in my mind almost immediately after I leftCollege... ' An 'outsider', in the terminology I developed, is a self-actualizeswho wants to sidestep the demands of everyday life and get down to creation. He(or she) wants to evolve, to move on. Maslow's classic case was of a girl whohad been a brilliant sociology student at college, and was forced to take a jobas a personnel manager in a chewing gum factory during the depression years; shebecame so depressed she even ceased to menstruate. Maslow cured her by simplysuggesting that she should continue her studies at night school. She was gettingsick of marking time, staying in the same place. W. B. Yeats had a fantasy of a'Castle on a Rock' where a community of poets and artists could spend theirlives growing vegetables and living the life of the mind. What really destroyedVan Gogh was not the mental strain of being a visionary; it was the strain ofnever knowing where his next meal was coming from, of always being poor, ofhaving to live off his brother who, unburdened by a powerful creative urge, wasable to bring himself to work for a living. Gauguin hoped to find his freedom inthe South Seas, but poverty followed him there. This is the basic problem of theOutsider; he just wants time to sort himself out, to be creative.In my own teens, I dreamed of retiring to one of those stone huts on the AranIsles, formerly occupied by religious ascetics. This problem—of how to stayalive and develop my potentialities, in a society that insisted that I workforty-five hours a week for just enough money to keep me alive—was solved by thesuccess of The Outsider. It is true that it brought as many problems as itsolved; but it certainly solved that basic problem: of how to avoid working in afactory or office, doing somebody else's business instead of my own. So I hadsolved the problem by the time I was twenty-four. The writer's life still hasplenty of problems—The Author has conducted a survey that showed that less thana hundred writers in Great Britain can live wholly from their working—but atleast they are problems you can feel strongly about, not problems that strikeyou as infinitely boring and irrelevant.Robert Leftwich had faced the problem logically, and set out to solve it in asensible, determined way: to save enough money to retire while fairly young, andbe able to devote the last third of his life to 'self-actualization'. 'I beganto economize very enthusiastically by depriving myself of all unnecessaryluxuries......ad had a shot at the same method, working for a few weeks to makea little spare money, then sleeping out in a sleeping bag to save rent, andeating in cheap workman's cafes. I also had reason to sympathize with Robert'sdivagation, if that is the word: '... ultimately, the basic desire for femalecompanionship superseded these good intentions, with the result that... Ieventually found myself engaged.' I had also found myself married and a parent;I fled the dilemma, rather than solved it, by separating from my wife aftereighteen months. Robert had behaved more decently; he married, producedchildren, and continued to work towards the ideal of 'escape', while continuingto take full responsibility for his wife and children. He had recognized, aftera while, that marriage and parenthood would not provide a substitute for what hereally wanted. When I first met him, he felt he had about another year before hecould 'escape'; at the time of writing, two years later, he is somewhere in theSouth of France with a caravan, while Patricia and the children are in England.The desire for escape has been Leftwich's lifelong preoccupation. And itsuggests a reason for the development of his unusual powers. He set himself along-distance aim—a very long-distance aim, since it has taken him until he isfifty to achieve it. Now anybody who has ever set out determinedly to loseweight knows about the curious effect of 'moral uplift' that can come fromself-discipline. Once you've embarked on the course, and see your weightvanishing at a rate of five pounds a week, you become a kind of miser aboutevery mouthful of bread. You begin to calculate—by Easter you'll have losttwenty-five pounds... Being hungry becomes a kind of pleasure. It even becomes akind of addiction; doctors are familiar with cases of girls who diet to achieve'Twiggy figures', and then continue to starve until they are suffering fromserious undernourishment, and have to be force-fed. But even dieting is a fairlyshort-term discipline; at the end of three months or so, you can go back tonormal eating. Robert Leftwich has been subjecting himself to a rigorousself-discipline for twenty-five years or so.Now what does discipline do? Basically, it increases one's 'vital reserves'—or,rather, makes them more available. It makes one more 'free'. Satre said he hadnever felt so free as during the war, when he was in the Resistance, was likelyto be arrested and shot at any moment. Why? Because he had to maintain a higherlevel of alertness, of 'preparedness'. Similarly, the disciplines evolved byGurdjieff—and practised at his Institute for the Harmonious Development of Manat Fontainebleau—aimed at keeping his pupils in a state of constant alertness:they might be asked to leap out of bed in the middle of the night and instantlyassume some difficult position. A young boy, Fritz Peters, was induced to makegreater and greater efforts mowing the lawns, until he could do vast areas inone day. The aim was to keep everyone bubbling with energy. 'Compared to what weought to be, we are only half awake,' said William James, who might almost havebeen quoting Gurdjieff. (Gurdjieff would have said that, compared to what weought to be, we are fast asleep.) 'We are making use of only a small part of ourmental and physical resources.' 'We live subject to arrest by degrees of fatiguewhich we have come only from habit to obey. Most of us may learn to push thebarrier further off, and to live in perfect comfort on much higher levels ofpower.' And he adds: 'The transformation, moreover, is a chronic one; the newlevel of energy becomes permanent.' All these quotations are from his importantessay 'The Energies of Man'.It is not only ignorance—or laziness—that keeps us 'below our proper selves'.All animals are complicated systems of drives and inhibitions. Differentcircumstances require different responses. In battle, it is of great advantageto be carried away by anger; in peace time, it could be a great disadvantage. Aself-controlled man would be able to allow himself to be carried away by angerwhen it suits him, and to inhibit it when it doesn't: that is to say, he sets upa system of control even over the ability to lose control. Such complexities arebound to defeat their own purpose sometimes—particularly in modern civilizedlife: hence Rousseau's nostalgia for the life of the noble savage; hence therising rate of neurosis in our society. The sheer entanglement of inhibitorysystems and anti-inhibitory systems and systems for overruling anti-inhibitorysystems is bound to produce a certain energy wastage through tension.Psychologists have observed that when a patient is hypnotized, and told that hecannot move his arm, he finds it impossible to move it, no matter how hard hetries. On examining what is happening in more detail, it has been found that,for example, a patient who has been told to bend his arm is actually contractinghis flexor muscles, but is also contracting the extensor muscles to prevent himfrom bending it; his self-division (in this case, an artificial one caused bythe hypnotist) causes him to cancel out an action he is attempting to perform.On the other hand, tests on patients under hypnosis have also shown that theycan be made to exert far more strength than they are capable of exerting when'awake': up to one-third more. Their mental performance can also be improved ina similar ratio. We might say, then, that our natural powers are inhibited by aself-consciousness that has the same basic nature as embarrassment or stagefright. I can overcome this 'canceling' process in two ways: either by relaxingcompletely (perhaps with the aid of drugs or alcohol, or by meditationtechniques), or by making such a steady and determined effort that I launchmyself onto a higher plane of energy, in which the forward drive completelyoverrules the inhibitory mechanism.In his book, Leftwich says he isn't sure whether his tireless energy is due tohis 'self-imposed restrictive way of life', or whether he was 'fortunate enoughto inherit a very high basic metabolic rate'. I would plump for the first.I read a great deal of Philosophy of an Escapist that first night he stayed withus, and it was then that I definitely decided that I would like to write abouthim, whether or not I could satisfy my curiosity about his powers. I have toadmit that I had misgivings about having Robert actually around the premises. Iusually write all day; then, at six o'clock, I'm ready to pour a glass of wineand spend a long evening listening to music or reading, or even watching TV ifthere is some culturally rewarding program such as Maigret or The Avengers. Ilike to 'switch off and become purely receptive; and I tend to resent it if Ihave guests who want to discuss questions of philosophy or psychology; it may berelaxation for them, but for me, it is talking shop. But Robert wasn't as bad asI'd anticipated. I was amused to watch Joy's reaction to him; I could see shedidn't quite know what to make of him, bewildered by the impact of his schoolboyexuberance and completely non-offensive—because totally candid—egoism. Herepeated some of the things he had said to me before—for example, about dowsing,or the ability to make things happen—and I noted that he repeated them in almostexactly the same words. This reinforced my feeling of his basic honesty; a manwho is letting his imagination run away with him tends to change things slightlyeach time, to embroider...This ability to make things happen, was, in effect, an extension of his trick ofmaking the schoolmaster ask him to repeat the only lines he'd learned, and Ifound one story particularly interesting. Robert said he'd been talking with afriend about the power of the mind. They were walking through central London,and Robert said: 'For example, we could walk into any shop and take anythingwithout paying for it.' When his friend showed skepticism, he offered todemonstrate. They walked into a shop that had two assistants. As they did so,one assistant said 'I'm going to the store room' and went out. At that moment,the telephone rang, and the other assistant said: 'Excuse me,' and also wentout, leaving them alone: Robert said: 'You see.' 'But that's just coincidence,'said his friend. 'All right, I'll do it again.' They went into another shop.Within a few minutes, a woman fainted and all the staff went to her aid, leavingthem free... By this time the friend was looking worried. 'It's stillcoincidence...' 'All right, we'll do it again.' And they did. On the thirdoccasion, they went into a shop and he warned that they were playing with verydangerous forces. They had hardly been in there for two minutes, when there wasan accident in the road outside causing all the staff and customers to leave.If this story sounded astonishing, his next statement was even more so. In orderto establish beyond all doubt that this was a 'power' of the mind he was using,he decided to do it a thousand times. And he claims he did. He didn't say howlong this took him, but he did mention that he devoted his 'proceeds', such asthey were, to charity.No doubt this anecdote will arouse more skepticism than any so far. I find itconsistent with Leftwich's other premises. There can be no doubt that the chieffault we have developed, through the long course of human evolution, is acertain basic passivity. When provoked by challenges, human beings aremagnificent. When life is quiet and even, we take the path of least resistance,and then wonder why we feel bored. A man who is determined and active doesn'tpay much attention to 'luck'. If things go badly, he takes a deep breath andredoubles his effort. And he quickly discovers that his moments of deepesthappiness often come after such efforts. The man who has become accustomed to apassive existence becomes preoccupied with 'luck'; it may become an obsession.When things go well, he is delighted and good humored; when they go badly, hebecomes gloomy and petulant. He is unhappy—or dissatisfied—most of the time, foreven when he has no cause for complaint, he feels that gratitude would bepremature; things might go wrong at any moment; you can't really trust theworld... Gambling is one basic response to this passivity, revealing theobsession with luck, the desire to make things happen.The absurdity about this attitude is that we fail to recognize the active partwe play in making life a pleasure. When my will is active, my whole mental andphysical being works better, just as my digestion works better if I takeexercise between meals. I gain an increasing feeling of control over my life,instead of the feeling of helplessness (what Sartre calls 'contingency') thatcomes from long periods of passivity. Yet even people who are intelligent enoughto recognize this find the habit of passivity so deeply ingrained that they findthemselves holding their breath when things go well, hoping fate will continueto be kind.To actually believe, as Leftwich does, that you control your luck, could be avital step in human evolution, a real turning point. And what is especiallyimportant is that he rejects the idea that you can 'push your luck' too far. Hebelieves that this power to make things go well is as straightforward as anyother physical activity. When a man sets out to drive to his office, he doesn'ttake a deep breath and say: 'Well, here goes. Let's hope I make it today...'There is a chance that he may not make it, especially in modern city traffic;but he also knows that if he drives carefully enough, he'll make it. He doesn'teven think: 'There's a ten thousand to one chance I might meet with anaccident.' He simply takes it for granted that he'll reach his office. A littlelate, perhaps, if the traffic is bad; but he'll get there. So Leftwich'sassertion that he decided to repeat his performance a thousand times, to provethat the mind can control 'luck', is of some importance. He has laid down abasic principle of the next step in human evolution.In The Occult, I quote a remark Robert Graves made to me: that many young menuse a form of witchcraft to seduce young women. I had been instantly struck bythe truth of this. My own experience has not been wide or varied, but I knewexactly what he meant. A man wants a girl, and he begins to think about her in aparticular way; not just daydreaming, but with a kind of calculatingdetermination, like a hunter who is determined to get a certain animal if he hasto track it for weeks. Some kind of psychic force seems to come intooperation—connected with imagination, just like the trick of turning the paperroundabout—and he may feel certain that he'll achieve his object long before hehas any concrete reasons for thinking so.Leftwich's power to 'make things happen' is an extension of this. I am inclinedto believe that it involves no 'occult' faculty (such as second sight): that itis a power that depends simply on calling upon our 'vital reserves' andabandoning the customary attitude of passivity.Leftwich has visited me twice in Cornwall—the second time early in!973. He hadfinally resigned from his job, bought himself a Commer 'Highwayman' and wasprepared to take up his 'life of freedom' at last. He showed us the'Highwayman', and all its gadgets; these included a generator that, at the touchof a switch, would cause six hundred volts to surge through the bodywork of thevehicle. A sensible precaution, perhaps: no doubt a man who has slept in a housemost of his life feels insecure if he parks at the side of the road in someremote part of France—perhaps remembering the fate of the Drummond family... Butalso typical of Robert Leftwich, with that schoolboy delight in gadgets.From my own experience of him, I can vouch that he never seems to get tired—atleast, not noticeably. At seven in the morning, as Joy was sleepily switching onthe kettle and preparing to get the children's breakfast, Robert would appearoutside the kitchen window, as chirpy as if he'd been for a ten-mile walk,looking for shredded wheat and eager to elaborate on some point that he'doverlooked the night before... He also seems to possess the ability to preventhimself from getting cold. I find I need a fairly even temperature; if the roomgets cool, I begin to feel chilly around the neck, and need a scarf; if myworkroom gets too warm, I have to change my woollen sweater for a cotton one.Robert always seemed to be dressed in the same clothes—a sports jacket, shirtand tie, flannel trousers—and to be unaffected by temperature. He explained thatit had struck him one day that when you are embarrassed, you go 'hot all over',and that this power to increase one's body temperature must be natural to man.Ever since that time, he says, he has been able to increase his bodilytemperature at will.It was during the first visit to Cornwall that I set the tape recorder going,and started asking him questions. What I wanted chiefly was a straightforwardbiographical outline. The following is a brief summary of what he told me.The Leftwich family is basically French, originating in Saint-Sauveur innorthern France; the family name was originally De Leftwyche. Since his motherwas also French, Robert Leftwich may be regarded as more than 50 per centGallic. The family moved to Northwich, where there was, at one time, a LeftwichHall. On the whole, then, the family 'came down in the world'. Even so, hisfather, a mathematician and member of the Royal Society, had some distinguishedfriends, including Sir James Jeans, Sir Arthur Eddington and Sir Charles Boys,the man who 'weighed the earth'. Robert's rather casual relationship with thelatter ended when he was eleven or twelve; Sir Charles invited the Leftwichfamily to his home near Andover. Wandering around the garden, Robert found apump. Even at this time, he was fascinated by hydraulic devices. He primed thepump with a bucket of water, and worked the handle. A sludgy substance came out.He assumed the pump needed a lot more working before clear water came through,so he went on pumping... In fact, he emptied the liquid manure tanks, andflooded the lawn. Sir Charles wrote Leftwich senior a letter, asking him not tobring his son to the house in future...Fortunately, his father was a patient man—he needed to be with a son who was aborn rebel and always into mischief. (At this point, Robert made an interestingdigression. He himself, he says, is not a particularly good or patient father.'I love my children, but I don't really like them. Because, I suppose, they'retoo much like me—rebellious. Particularly Bobby. Which is largely my own fault.I decided I wanted to have a child with the same birthday as myself. So my wifeand I did calculations. In fact, Bobby arrived a few hours after my birthday—6May—was over. But if there's anything in astrology—our characters are almostidentical.' *) [* I must admit that I never cease to be amazed at the weirdaccuracy of astrological character assessments. According to Derek Parker's TheCompleat Astrologer, the character of the Taurean—21st April to 21 May is'Practical, reliable, adept at business, having strong powers of endurance, afirm sense of values'. Negative traits may include possessiveness and anobsession with routines. 'He will be likely to be successful in a career to dowith finance, and he will look forward to security (with pension) inretirement.. .At the same time, he has a distinct artistic leaning.' As to therelation with his children: 'It is very difficult for the Taurean, with his veryconservative instincts, to bridge the generation gap with the young; and all tooeasy for him, with his liking for discipline, to ignore the fact that hischildren may not be in sympathy with his ideas...'Robert may have inherited some of his 'psychic' faculties from his mother; shewas the sort of person who could say at breakfast 'I've got a feeling I'm goingto hear from so and so today'—and the postman would then arrive with the letter.But on the whole, there was nothing psychic about his family; it was a matterthat simply did not interest them. So when, at the age of four or five, Robertfound himself one evening looking down on his own body in the bed, there was noone in the family who could explain to him that he was simply experiencing'astral projection'. Children take these things much more for granted thanadults, so this odd ability never worried him. He was certainly not one ofReichenbach's 'sick sensitives'. In fact, his account of himself as a childmakes him sound more like Richmal Crompton's Just William, with a touch ofJefferies' Beyis. He played elaborate imaginative games with a close friend, andthey encouraged one another in such dangerous feats as dropping off a railwaybridge on to the moving carriages below. This adventurous 'Just William' elementcontinued to be a strong part of his character; later on, he traveled thousandsof miles around Europe and North Africa on the tops of trains, or, occasionally,clinging underneath the carriages.In spite of his self-discipline, his attention to detail, Leftwich is basicallyan anarchist. 'I can't bear any form of regimentation.' Listening to hisanecdotes, I was suddenly reminded of Gurdjieff. In his autobiographical bookMeetings with Remarkable Men, Gurdjieff emerges as an amiable rogue. He spentthe first half of his life wandering from place to place—'bumming around', as wewould say now making a living as best he could; his methods were usuallyingenious, sometimes downright crooked. And yet, beyond all shadow of doubt, hewas no charlatan; he possessed knowledge and he possessed power. In many ways,Robert's personality make-up resembles Gurdjieff s. It suddenly struck me thatthese anecdotes about his anti-authoritarianism, his obsession with travel, arenot as irrelevant as I at first thought. He was telling me a story about an RAFdriving instructor who was supposed to teach him to drive a truck. Robert couldalready drive, so when the man began to explain: 'This is the ignition key, thisis the clutch' he became impatient. When he started the truck, he went fromfirst, into second, then into third gear. At which the instructor stopped himwith a roar of rage. 'If you don't do as you're told we'll never get anywhere.''But I can drive.' 'As far as I'm concerned, you can't. Now, let's start again.This is the ignition key... ' One can understand his reaction in the face ofthis kind of unbelievable stupidity. On the other hand, it reinforced theindividualism, the determination to go his own way and to stand alone. And this,in turn, encouraged the development of this odd power 'to make things happen'.'Witchcraft', of the kind we have been discussing, depends on clearly wantingsomething, and directing all your psychic energies towards getting it. Robert'sdashes with authority in its most obtuse and bigoted form led him to form a verydear idea that he wanted freedom: the first necessity for obtaining it.His RAF career offers some excellent examples of the working of'Leftwitchcraft'. The war was over—fortunately—when he was posted abroad. On theboat to Dieppe, the sea was rough, and the washrooms were full of vomiting men.Robert wanted to use the toilet; so he marched around the deck until he came toa sign 'Out of bounds to all ranks', and unhesitatingly went past it. The crewallowed him to use their toilet, and then invited him to join them in a game ofcards; he had actually won 7/6d when the boat arrived in France. Then there wasa long rail journey south. It suddenly struck Robert that he was approaching thecountry of his ancestors, and that he had relatives in Cannes. In the transitcamp, all was confusion. So he buried his kitbag, and walked out. In Cannes,fortunately, there were no military police. He found his relatives, lived therefor a couple of months, then finally made his way back to the camp. He dug uphis kitbag and found himself a bed. The next day on parade, names were calledfrom a list. Robert reasoned that no one was checking on each individual, so hepicked up his kitbag and joined the group who were due to leave. At the docks,they were counted and found to be one too many. The last man on the list wassent back. Robert went on to North Africa, and found himself in the camp thatcontained the remaining men of his old unit—the rest had already been posted allover the Middle East. A couple of days after that, his own name was called outon parade, and he was posted. No one had even noticed his absence. Instead ofthanking his stars that he'd avoided a court martial, Robert continued to 'pushhis luck'. He was assigned to the job of driving the 'shit wagon'; he didn'tlike it. So on the second day, he refused. It should have resulted in being puton a charge; instead, after being interviewed by everyone from the MT officer tothe Wing Commander in charge of the station, he was temporarily taken off duty.Then he was offered the job of helping to reclaim and recondition vehicles thathad broken down in the desert during the war, and a team of engineers to helphim do it. Once again, he had the freedom he wanted. One day, he was told totake a Daimler to Cairo, and to instruct the chauffeur of Sir Charles Medhurst,Commander in Chief in the Middle East, in how to drive it. It struck Robert thatthis was the kind of job he would enjoy. In this case, his 'Leftwitchcraft' wasfacilitated by the fact that Sir Charles had known his Aunt Vera Leftwich. Hebecame Medhurst's chauffeur; and eventually with a certain amount of stringpulling (involving Aunt Vera), he obtained his discharge from the forces. Bythis time, his direction was fixed, although he still had a long way to gobefore understanding what it was he wanted out of life. He knew he wanted totravel; he also experienced an obscurer need, a desire to understand his owninner-being, which took the form of intense curiosity about worldreligions. Hewent back to the Middle East, to study Mahommedanism at first hand; he also usedhis childhood knowledge of trains to travel long distances without paying. (Onone occasion, travelling from Cairo to Haifa on the roof of a train, he cameclose to being decapitated. He was standing up on the roof, stretching andyawning, when the friend with whom he was travelling dragged him down; thetelegraph wires crossed from one side of the track to the other, about five feetabove the roof of the train...)Like Sir Richard Burton, he disguised himself as an Arab and went into mosques.He saw nothing that convinced him that his answer lay in Islam. The interest inreligion disposed his mind more favorably to Christianity (to which his attitudehad always been lukewarm), although he found the 'middle of the road' doctrinesof the Church of England uninteresting. The millennialism of the Seventh DayAdventists appealed altogether more strongly: their conviction of the imminenceof the Second Coming, their absorption in the prophecies of the Old Testament;even their Sabbatarian Fundamentalism appealed to the ascetic side of him. Butafter a while, he found himself unable to stomach the dogmatism, and turned tothe study of religions of the east—Hinduism and Buddhism. He was also unable toaccept the idea of Jesus as the God-Man and Savior, and declined to accept thatthe miracles proved his divinity. He already had a suspicion that anyone canperform miracles if he can tap his hidden resources. Nevertheless, the SeventhDay Adventists were an important influence, with their emphasis on theimportance of physical health, their sparing use of meat and intense dislike oftobacco and alcohol. (I asked Robert if he had always been a non-smoker. He saidNo; he had smoked as a young man. One day in a cinema, he realized he was out ofcigarettes, and felt such a strong desire for a smoke that he went out to thefoyer to buy some. Back in the cinema, he began to brood on his dependence oncigarettes—even then he believed that the mind should be able to completelycontrol the body. He got up, left the cinema, presented the cigarettes to thefirst man he met in the street, and gave up smoking.)On the whole, Buddhism struck him as the religion that made the strongest appealto his inner needs; he still regards himself as fundamentally a Buddhist(although, in Philosophy of an Escapist, he states his belief in a Creator ofthe universe, and seems altogether closer to a mystical pantheism). During thisstage—when he was investigating comparative religions—he had no particularinterest in 'occultism'. I asked him if he could say roughly when it began tointerest him. He placed the date at about 1957, when he was looking around anantique shop near Reigate. He got into conversation with the proprietor, awoman, and when he left, shook her hand. She looked at him in an odd way, andsaid 'You're a healer, aren't you?' Robert said not as far as he knew. Shelooked at his hand, and what she saw in his palm apparently confirmed herintuition; she told him that he had a line on his palm that only one person inten thousand possesses.Still, he was skeptical—or perhaps only uninterested. Five more years went by.One morning, on his way to work, he noticed workmen digging a hole; on theprevious two days he had noticed them digging holes in other places nearby. Hestopped the car and asked them what they were doing ('You know I'm extremelyinquisitive'). They said they'd lost the water main—and at that moment, adiviner arrived, took out his rods, and within a few minutes had located themain. Robert asked if he could try it, and the diviner handed him the forkedstick. Robert walked over the main—and felt the stick twist violently in hishands. He was so excited that he decided not to go to work. Instead, he went tothe Lewes Public Library, and consulted all their books on dowsing. Hediscovered that there is a British Society of Dowsers, and that the presidentwas a Colonel Bell who lived in Cuckfield. Robert contacted him, and soon becamean active dowser. At the same time, he discovered he also possessed certainhealing gifts—someone told him that dowsing and healing go together. He hasnever tried to develop these; but he can cure his wife of severe migraine in afew minutes, by laying his hands on her forehead; and can cure an ordinaryheadache in ten seconds.)When Brian Inglis came to lecture to the Society, he asked if any dowsers wouldbe willing to demonstrate their powers on television. Everyone declined; thegeneral feeling was that these things depend on a certain inner-concentration,and that TV cameras would spoil it. Robert said this was untrue: If dowsingdepended on the power of the mind, then it shouldn't make any difference whereit was done.The result was the TV broadcast of 1968 when—as already mentioned—he found threeout of five tins of water, a result he regarded as poor, but which satisfiedBrian Inglis—as well as the Society of Dowsers, who had declined to haveanything to do with the program.Having discovered that he could dowse for water, Leftwich was curious to knowwhat other hidden abilities he might possess. Experiment soon convinced him thathe could find anything—provided he had an idea of what he was looking for. Hecan detect any liquid—for example, oil—any solid object, and even empty space(he has often been asked to dowse for tunnels). This obviously suggests that hehas some subconscious knowledge of the 'field' he is looking for. Again, it isthe 'directionality' of the mind that seems to be important. Most of us lackthese abilities because we never direct the mind in that direction.He also seems to possess strong telepathic abilities, although these depend, toa large extent, upon whether the other person involved is a good receiver (ortransmitter). He mentioned one friend who is an exceptionally good receiver.Robert hands him a pack of cards, tells him to shuffle them, and then placeseveral cards, face downwards, on a table. He says: 'Move your hand back andforward over the cards; the one you finally decide to pick up will be the ten ofdiamonds.' His friend moves his hand, hesitates, then says: 'No, I won't havethat one—I'll have this... ' And his second choice proves to be the ten ofdiamonds. The friend often asks: 'How did you do that?' to which Robert replies:'I don't know.'I felt this was an area in which I could test him. I had contemplated gettinghim to accompany me round the local shops, and getting him to demonstrate hispowers of shoplifting; but it struck me that if he failed, we might both be introuble. We took a pack of cards—it was ours, not his. He told me to shufflethem, and then start placing them, face down, on the table, while he stoodseveral feet away, where he could not see the cards. 'I'll stop you when you getto the ace of clubs.' After I had thrown down twenty cards or so, he said:'Stop, that's it.' It was the ace of clubs. We did it several times more. He wasnot right every time—I think there were three failures out of seven. He wasapologetic, and said that it could be because this was the first time we'd triedit; but I found the performance impressive.On the other hand, I have to admit that, in spite of his obvious dowsingabilities, his demonstration in that direction was not wholly successful either.When he came to see us in 1972,1 was having water trouble. To begin with, Inoticed that the walls of a new room we'd just had built on to the house weregetting damp at the bottom. One day, I moved a bookcase and found the floor, andcarpet, underneath it flooded. With the help of the local handyman—who built theroom—I knocked a hole in the outside wall, just below ground level. As thechisel went through, there was a violent gush of water, and a torrent came fromunder the house. When we turned off the water at the main, the flood ceased;obviously, we had a burst pipe. The problem: to locate the burst, and dig downto it. It had to be exactly located, unless I wanted to tear up several yards ofconcrete. Robert walked around the room, and got strong water reactions fromnear the far wall. (Oddly enough, so did Joy, who asked if she could try hisrods—she is obviously another natural dowser.) He wandered around outside thehouse, and got a very strong reaction outside the wall. 'I think your burstpipe's down here...' I got out a steel punch and a lump hammer, and startedcutting down into the concrete. It took me most of a morning, but when I wasabout six inches down, the water began to well up through it. Then I reached theearth underneath, and the water began to seep into the hole. I spent the rest ofthe day enlarging it, suddenly delighted at the prospect of finding the brokenpipe, and being able to call in the local plumber to repair it... But although Ienlarged the hole to a foot or so, and dug down nearly two feet, I could find nopipe. On the housing estate below us, a bulldozer was in action; I went down andasked him if he could come up and dig through some concrete for me; he agreed tocome the next day. By that time Robert had left, to rejoin his family nearPenzance. The next morning, the bulldozer arrived. It had a narrow diggingshovel with long steel teeth. The method of breaking into the concrete was topose the shovel, teeth downwards, six feet above the ground, then allow it todrop; each time, the teeth bit in deeper. Finally, the surface was crackedenough to tear up the concrete in lumps. I looked on with satisfaction, waitingfor the water to spurt from the leak; nothing happened. When he'd reached adepth of six feet, it was obvious that nothing would happen. Baffled, Isuggested that he dig in another place round the corner where the water wasrunning in a steady stream from under the house. He tore up the concrete there.No pipe. Finally, I asked him to dig at a spot ten feet away where I knew thepipe ran. It was a lucky guess; the pipe made a right-angle-bend at that spot,and we could assume that it ran from there straight into the house—several yardsfrom both spots where we'd been tearing up concrete. I cursed Robert, and askedthe bulldozer operator to fill in the holes again... (We solved the waterproblem by having a new pipe laid from the right-angle-bend, around the outsideof the house.) When I wrote to him a week later, I mentioned casually that hehad been mistaken about the water—but I didn't mention where the pipe wasactually situated. He wrote back, commenting that he had found another waterpipe under the deep freeze, but hadn't bothered to mention it since I seemed socertain the one we were looking for ran outside the house.So on the whole, I would count our water problem as one of hisfailures—although, since most of the space under the new room was flooded withwater, perhaps this is unfair.What are my general impressions and conclusions about Robert Leftwich?I must first state a general principle, which is known to every student ofmysticism. 'Strange powers' have nothing to do with what the mystics would call'knowledge of God'. The Persian mages were, in fact, priests of Zoroaster, andwe tend to associate the idea of the 'magician' with spiritual power—an ideathat has been fostered by the Christian tradition of miracles. According to SriRamakrishna, the power to 'work miracles' may be a by-product of spiritualadvancement; but it is an unimportant byproduct. In The Occult, I wrote:'Eusapia Palladino was undoubtedly a genuine medium; yet she was exposed forfraud several times; a kind of genial dishonesty seemed to be part of hercharacter, as of Madame Blavatsky's.' And in my book on Rasputin, I made thesame point: that some saints acquire 'power' in the course of spiritualadvancement, other men are born with it—like Rasputin, and even Hitler (whosepower was, of course, of a different kind)—and may misuse it.I say this because I am fully aware that if any thoroughgoing skeptic, with alogical-positivist turn of mind, read my account of Leftwich, he would say thatit demonstrates nothing but Robert's desire for 'fame', and my gullibility. Infact, when I first met Robert, I was aware of this possibility. Not that hemakes an impression of dishonesty; he doesn't. But that a man so obviouslypeople-oriented might be deceiving himself. On the other hand, hisdemonstrations with the divining rod made it perfectly clear that he possessesthe power of dowsing to a high degree. The more I got to know him, the more Ifelt that he is basically a solid and consistent character, whose schoolboyishexterior only seems to be at variance with the powers he possesses.I tend to be naturally sympathetic to him because I have always been a rathercheerful and optimistic sort of person, and to some extent, my experienceparallels his own. His descriptions of his childhood make it clear that healways had superabundant vitality, and intense curiosity. He mentions that, atthe age of five, he used to be up before anyone else in the household—at sixa.m.—and out in the street, building dams in the gutter with the aid of a toysweeping brush. The odd affinity for water was already apparent. At school, hedeveloped the knack of concealing his laziness by the trick already mentioned:somehow 'willing' the master to ask him only the questions he knew. The resultwas that he always did badly in exams; but this was attributed to exam nerves.And in conversations with me, he mentioned several times his lifelong ability toget his own way. (For example, he decided one day that he would like a Kipp'sapparatus—a device for producing Hydrogen Sulphide in the laboratory. The nextday, he saw one among a pile of unused glassware at a factory he was visiting onbusiness; when he asked about the apparatus, the manager said it was going to bethrown out, and told him to take it home. He mentioned a dozen other examples ofsimilar 'coincidences.') He said, wryly, that this ability to get whatever hewants has probably been bad for his character; and, to some extent, this may betrue. I am not saying that people need adversity to improve their characters;intelligence and self-criticism will serve just as well; but some problems mayturn your attention in a particular direction, and produce important insights. Aman with too much power to control his own destiny may be in danger of limitinghis experience to what he thinks he wants. For example, it may be all very niceto get a Kipp's apparatus within a week of deciding you'd like to own one; buthe admits it has been in his attic, unused, ever since.This breezy, willful aspect of his character may explain why he is a good'transmitter' but a poor 'receiver'. He mentioned a friend, Walter Mellor, thechief engineer of a large firm, who is a superb receiver. Mellor can go out ofthe room, and Robert thinks of a number, 'transmits' it, and writes it down on apiece of paper. Mellor comes into the room, and can announce the four-figurenumber correctly and without hesitation, before lifting the paper to verify it.But if Robert goes out of the room, and Mellor tries to transmit, there is noresult. Mellor's forehead begins to perspire, and nothing comes into Robert'shead. Mellor is also a 'sensitive': he can take an object—say, Patricia'swatch—and tell her all kinds of things about herself that he cannot possiblyhave known. Leftwich cannot do this; his mind is attuned to 'doing', notreceiving. Yet when I asked him about this, he remarked, interestingly, that hefelt he 'didn't know where to start'. 'Perhaps if I knew where to start, I coulddo it. But I just don't know.'This led us on to the subject of dowsing; I asked him how, in that case, heaccounted for his ability to divine almost anything. The answer was important.'There used to be two schools of thought, and I made a third. One schoolbelieves all matter emits some radiation, and some people are sensitive to it.Two, that we emit some minute radar signal that enables us to \"pick up\" whatwe're looking for. But this doesn't explain how I can use other people to dowse.I can see a man walking down the street, and tune in to him. And as he passesover, say, a water pipe, he emits a signal which I pick up.' This is obviouslynot quite accurate; this is accounted for by the radar theory. But then, asLeftwich went on to point out, neither of these theories accounts for mapdowsing. This is certainly the most baffling form of divining; the map dowsercan sit at home, suspend his pendulum—or whatever he uses—over a map, and say:'There is water in the comer of this field.' Although this sounds preposterous,it is well attested as the more common form of dowsing. In Rasputin, I describedhow a map-dowser had taken a letter from me and held it (unopened) in one hand,while he allowed a pendulum to swing above the map of England with the other.The two intersecting lines of its swing pinpointed the place where the sender(Margaret Lane) was at that moment, as I later confirmed. Leftwich believes thatall dowsing depends on the 'superconscious' mind—a term invented, as far as Iknow, by Aldous Huxley, who asked why, if the mind has a Freudian 'basement'which is hidden from consciousness, it should not also have a non-Freudianattic.[1] This, Leftwich believes, is the basic source of the ability to dowse.The superconscious mind is certainly an extremely tempting hypothesis to all whoare interested in the theory of occultism. It explains, for example, thethousands of well-attested cases of 'specters of the living'. Goethe relates,for example, how, when he was out for a walk in the rain, he saw a friendwearing his own dressing gown and slippers, walking in front of him. When hearrived home, he found the friend seated in front of the fire in his dressinggown and slippers; he had got soaked on his way to Goethe's house. The friendwas completely unaware of having walked in front of Goethe in the rain. And inmany cases of 'specters of the living', the person whose 'specter' is seen knowsnothing about it—although he may have been thinking about the person to whom itappeared at the time. Telepathy is a possible explanation of these specters—i.e.the assumption that there was no 'real' specter, only an image of the person inthe mind of the 'receiver'. On the other hand, there have been cases in whichthe specter has been seen by several people, and it seems unlikely that all aregood receivers. Leftwich's 'superconscious' seems a better explanation: thatthere is a part of the mind whose powers exceed those of normal consciousness,and that can be 'elsewhere'—like Prospero's messenger Arid—when it pleases.Leftwich has, to some extent, learned the trick of controlling his Arid. My owntheory of Leftwich's powers is simply this. The superconscious operatesefficiently only when our energies are high. It is, in a sense, a 'dispensable'part of the mind, not essential to our survival. Goethe's guest was sittingcomfortably in front of the fire, relaxed and thinking about Goethe; perhaps hehad a 'peak experience', one of those spontaneous overflows of sheer joydescribed by Maslow. The superconscious felt free to go and find Goethe Mostaccounts of specters of the living that I have seen occur either when the personis thinking of someone, or is totally relaxed.Leftwich has always been a person of high energy; consequently, he has alwayshad an active superconscious. The superconscious is, as I have said, the mind'sArid; sometimes it acts simply as a radar system, warning of dangers, possibleaccidents. ('Accident-proneness' and misfortune-proneness in general seem to beconnected with low psychic energies, self-pity, tiredness, defeatism.) Thesuperconscious is, basically, the power to project oneself. This explains whyLeftwich also possesses the power of astral projection, although he is by nomeans a 'sick sensitive', (he explained to me that the periods when he can'project' his astral body are always preceded by a feeling that seems toresemble the feelings of an epileptic before an attack—he has discussed thesubject with epileptics in the course of his work for the Samaritans.) It alsoexplains his 'luck', his ability to get what he wants.When he came to Cornwall for the first time, he was driving a blue saloon car.He told me that he always drives very fast being an impatient sort of person—buthas never had an accident. This, he said, was because his astral body was'above' the car, enabling him to tell what was coming. I do not think he meantthat literally—for when the astral body is being projected, the physical bodygoes into a trance. He meant, I suspect, that his 'superconscious' enables himto avoid accidents; and he talked about the astral body because he is aware thatthere is a close connection (perhaps they are even the same thing). He had atypical story about this. One early morning, driving very fast, he was stoppedby a police patrol car; an irate policeman asked him if he was aware that he hadovertaken dangerously three times within the past five minutes. Robert, withtypical precision, explained that he hadn't been overtaking dangerously. 'It'sdifficult to explain, but it's to do with partial detachment from the physicalbody. The Society for Psychical Research can tell you about it—I'm a membermyself 'I don't care what bloody society you're a member of. Get out of thatbloody car...' But, typically, he escaped without a summons, although the patrolcar followed him for miles; then, when he thought he'd lost it, another patrolcar followed him, obviously alerted by radio to look out for a nut in a bluesaloon car.The 'superconscious' hypothesis seems to me to explain his rather curiousassortment of powers: dowsing, astral projection, 'making things happen' andgetting his own way. But it leaves other questions unanswered. For example: arewe dealing with 'natural' powers, pure and simple? This was a question alsoraised in The Occult. Primitive people believe in external forces of good andevil; we have gone to the opposite extreme, and try to account for everything inmechanical or natural terms. For example, Lethbridge's theory of ghosts regardsthem as 'recordings' rather than living creatures. But Robert Leftwich mentionedthat there are times when his wife—and other people—feel that he is emanating aforce of evil—not-strong, perhaps, but noticeable. He says that he is unaware ofthis; it has nothing to do with malignant thoughts. Is he 'picking it up' fromoutside himself, and unconsciously transmitting it? I do not know, and hecertainly doesn't.Again, he has the power to stop people smoking. He described the process to meas follows. The subject sits opposite him, and Robert 'attunes' his mind to him.Robert then induces a feeling of numbness in his own fingers. When the subjectsays: 'My fingers are feeling numb,' he knows the attuning process is complete.At which point he says: 'This is because you're attuned to me. And I can nowassure you that you'll never feel the need to smoke again.' This, he says, hasbeen a failure in only one case—and even then, the man gave it up for threeyears. This sounds closer to telepathy—or straight hypnosis—than to the use ofthe superconscious. What is the relation between this power of suggestion andthe superconscious? Again, I have no idea.And yet I am strongly inclined to believe that we are dealing with naturalforces. I have just been playing back the tape I made of a conversation withLeftwich a year ago, and I reflect that Paracelsus would have thought it wassorcery. And so it is, in a way. I know about magnetism imprinting voicepatterns in iron oxide; but it still seems strange that a tape should be capableof carrying all the vibrations of the living voice—just as it seems strange tome that a wavy line on the surface of a gramophone record can carry all thecomplexities of a great orchestra. So it is not difficult to believe that theremay be other vibrations and fields of which we are at present ignorant. As Ilook across the room now, I can see a photograph on the back of a book jacket—aperfectly recognizable face. I pick it up and place it within three inches of myeyes. Now I can see just how little information the page actually carries—just afew blurry patches of black and grey. I hold it at arm's length—again, it is aface. My eyes can obviously 'decode' these patches, and read meaning intothem—provided they are given enough of them to form a judgement. As RobertLeftwich walks over the ground, looking for water, some faculty as natural assight decodes a set of vibrations, and tells him when he has found it. If I takethe same dowsing rod, nothing happens; I am, comparatively speaking, 'shortsighted'.But amid all my uncertainties, I am fairly sure of one thing. Robert Leftwich isa non-passive personality; in fact, he is a highly active personality, whosepsyche has always exerted a definite pressure on the outside world, in the formof curiosity, expectancy, interest. Such pressure is like water; it finds itsway into cracks, and enlarges them. His powers are the outcome of his attitude.He demonstrates, to my satisfaction, that psychic powers are a matter of choice,not of chance."},{"pageContent":"TwoMRS EUNICE BEATTIEAs an 'occult investigator', I am aware that I'm thoroughly unsatisfactory. WhenI ought to be asking penetrating questions, or devising means of testing thetruth of what I am being told, I simply listen and make notes. This, I suspect,is because I see the world through the eyes of a novelist. In a sense, I amincurious about people—about their affairs, their lives; but I'm interested inthe way their minds work, in their motivations. From a fairly early age, Ideveloped the conviction that most people waste their lives because they see theworld falsely. Anyone can understand what is meant if we say that someone is'utterly conventional': that such a person accepts a set of social valueswithout question, like a sheep that never feels curious about what lies on theother side of the hedge. But we find it altogether more difficult to grasp thatwe all live according to a set of conventions of consciousness: that, on thewhole, we see and hear what we expect to see and hear, and that there may beenormous areas of experience that cannot get past our mental filters. Forexample, can you imagine Mr Pickwick appreciating the music of Beethoven, or thepainting of Goya? (Can you imagine Dickens himself appreciating it, if it comesto that?) Could Jane Austen, even with the greatest stretch of the imagination,understand the murders committed by the Charles Manson 'family'? Our perceptionshave certain inbuilt limitations; yet, in a sense, it is we who limit them, aswe might turn down the volume control on the radio to what we consider a'bearable volume'. This is why Rimbaud dreamed of an 'ordered derangement of thesenses', deliberately pushing the senses beyond their normal limits.This is why I would find Robert Leftwich an interesting character, even if Icannot state positively that all his claims are true and unexaggerated. He isaware that the normal boundaries are not absolutes; he wants to break out beyondthem. Like Rimbaud, he has already rejected the 'communal fife-world'. A worldin which there were millions of people like him would be, for me, a moreinteresting place.And the same applies to Mrs Eunice Beattie, who is otherwise about as unlikeLeftwich as could be imagined. Outwardly she appears to be a perfectly ordinaryperson—a retired nurse, devoted to her married son and his family, living in anattractive suburb of Plymouth. She has written (and typed) hundreds of pagesthat reveal that either (a) she has a remarkable mind, or (b) that she has'tuned in' to other intelligences and transcribed some of their ideas.I have not kept a record of when I first met Mrs Beattie, but it must have beenin the early months of 1972. It was at the time when I was still receivingfloods of correspondence about The Occult, which had appeared the previousautumn. Mrs Beattie's letter said that she hoped I wouldn't consider her acrank, but that she had been producing automatic writing that seemed to her toanswer some basic questions about human purpose and destiny. I replied that I'dlike to see some of it, and asked her if she would like to come and have lunchat the Westward TV studios next time I was there. I gave her the date.I'd forgotten about her when a message came to say that a lady wanted to see meat the desk. I went down, and found Mrs Beattie looking nervously out of thewindow, as if tempted to dash out into the street. I asked her to come into thecanteen for lunch. As soon as we sat down, she handed me a manila folder full ofmanuscript. I opened it, and saw that the first page was headed with a quotationfrom one of Arthur Waley's translations of a Chinese poem. I read it with acertain amount of pleasure—an understandable reaction, I think, when one isfaced with a great sheaf of original manuscript that may be totally unreadable.It is like finding an oasis in a desert. I asked her if she liked Chinesepoetry. She looked blank; then, when I pointed to the Waley quotation, said shehad no idea who Arthur Waley was. It had simply been 'dictated' to her. Iglanced at the rest of the typescript, and saw mentions of Walt Whitman andAngelus Silesius. 'What about these? Have you read them?' 'No. Who is WaltWhitman?'As we ate, I looked at her curiously. She seemed shy, rather tense, as if tryingto cut herself off from the sounds of the room. She was small, attractive,around sixty; a journalist might take the easy way out and describe her asmotherly, but the rather smart hair style and the neat clothes reminded me thatshe had been a hospital sister—she had told me that in her letter. Very much thetype children take to—as I discovered when she met my children. She didn'tstrike me as in any way a crank; or, for that matter, anything like my idea of a'psychic' neither the professional spirit medium, nor the visionary peasantwoman of the type described by Yeats. I found her very difficult to place.She came and watched the program being videotaped, sitting quietly in a cornerof the studio without speaking to anybody. Afterwards I asked her if she'd foundit interesting. 'Oh, yes. Fascinating.' But I had a feeling she wouldn't havesaid so unless I'd asked her.Clearly, I wasn't going to be able to assess her without seeing rather more ofher. I asked her if she could come to my home that weekend. She looked anxious.'Are you sure your wife won't object?' 'I don't think so.' 'Perhaps you'd betterask her first and let me know.'Before we left the studio, I asked her how she had come to write to me. Iexpected her to say that she'd read something about The Occult, or seen me ontelevision. Again she surprised me. 'Your name came floating into my head oneday. I'd no idea who you were. Then, a week later, I saw something about you ina newspaper. I had an odd feeling that I ought to get in touch with you.'When I told Joy I'd asked Mrs Beattie over for the weekend, she asked: 'Whatsort of a person is she?' and I had to admit I didn't know. I could only say sheseemed a perfectly ordinary, normal person and I didn't think she'd be adifficult guest. Apart from Robert Leftwich, my acquaintance with 'psychics' hadbeen small. In my early twenties, when I was working at United Dairies,Chiswick, I had met a woman called Grace who worked in the canteen (I haveforgotten her other name), and I had been convinced that she possessed unusualpowers. She seemed to be an ordinary, middle-aged cockney lady, of the kindyou'd find behind almost any counter in any works canteen in the country; butJoy and I spent an evening with her, and I realized that she 'knew' a greatdeal—in the sense that Gurdjieff did; and the things she was able to tell meabout myself startled me. Mrs Beattie seemed as ordinary as Grace; and I waswilling to give her the benefit of the doubt. I am averagely skeptical, and Iwas aware of the possibility that she might be suffering from delusions, ormight be making it all up to make herself interesting. I didn't believe for amoment that she was suffering from delusions. Neither did it seem likely thatshe was making it all up—although I had to entertain the possibility. She was awidow, living on her own—and, by her own admission, without many close friends.I settled down to reading her manuscript, hoping it might provide clues. And thefirst thing that was obvious was that if she was pulling my leg, then it wasn'ta recently conceived plan. She'd written a lot, and over a long period; therewere diary references dating back ten years. And it soon struck me, from thegeneral tone of her writing, that she is deeply and genuinely preoccupied withwhat we loosely term 'the spiritual'. Now when some average,not-very-intelligent person becomes obsessed with religion, the result is anobvious feeling of unbalance; their minds become lop-sided; they spout thejargon, but it is almost a meaningless noise. In fact, it becomes a kind ofmask, designed to hide their stupidity. The most obvious thing about MrsBeattie's writing was that it was carefully and painstakingly saying something,and what it was saying was close to what all saints and mystics have alwayssaid, 'We are completely dependent on the creative energy of God, from our firstbreath. Our lives are usually wrecked by our sense of personal power.' AldousHuxley's anthology of mysticism, The Perennial Philosophy, is full of thesestatements about the need to abandon the 'Self, to become identified with theNot-Self. 'There are many,' said Mrs Beattie, 'who are branches of a tree thatare cut off from the main stem, and who do not know they are dying.' I got afeeling she knew what she was talking about; this was not just religiousgobbledygook. And there were places where I suddenly found myself reading withincreased interest. 'Man in his spiritual state is both male and female, and canthus create for himself—just as his Father can. Christ said that all he coulddo, men could do also, when they had come to full realization.' For some monthsbefore meeting Mrs Beattie, I had been struggling with the obscure butimpressive work of a Hungarian philosopher, Charlotte Bach, whose studies ofsexual perversion—particularly of 'trans-sexuality' (i.e. the man's desire tobecome a woman, and vice versa) had led her to a completely new theory ofevolution, in which the inner tensions created by this sexual ambiguity driveman up the evolutionary ladder. She had also noted that some human beingsachieve a precarious balance through the creative act. Mrs Beattie seemed to bestating the same thing much more simply. In many ways, she might be poles apartfrom the formidably intellectual and erudite Mrs Bach; but she seemed equallyaware of the possibilities of an evolution of consciousness. A disciple ofGurdjieff s once said that his system was 'a method of preventing your past frombecoming your future'; the same preoccupation ran throughout these manuscriptsof Mrs Beattie's.Now if that was all there was to it, I would have no difficulty about placingMrs Beattie. I would say that she was one of my 'outsiders', driven by deeperurges than most people, and therefore feeling rather out of place in ourordinary, working society. That in spite of this, in spite of a lack of formaleducation, she had gradually taught herself to think for herself, and achievedsome degree of insight into the problem of the evolution of spiritualconsciousness.'But her writing made it clear that it was more complicated than that. After somestudy, it seemed to me there were three distinct aspects to Mrs Beattie. Tobegin with, there was the straight religious aspect: the preoccupation with whatmost religious people would call salvation, and which she is inclined to callevolution. Next, there was the occultist strain, which might be reminiscent ofthe work of Emanuel Swedenborg:'I went out of my body one night, in the usual way, but instead of determiningmy destination. I was called instead; I found that I was on a high plateau, upin a mountainous country; it was very beautiful. There were a group of people,all dressed in white. One of these was my teacher, and he came to me, and saidthat this night, they were going to show me some scenes from the history of theworld. I sat down among them, and then picture after picture came before me, andI sat and watched as I saw the world as it used to be. They told me I waslooking at scenes in the race memory.'And this was closely connected to another aspect: pre-vision or prophecy. Someof these sound more like Nostradamus than Swedenborg: 'The coast of France willchange overnight. Paris will fall to rocket bombardment.' 'One man shall governthe world, centuries ahead; far, too far ahead for us to see.' 'A rain ofmeteors on the earth; I think it is a periodic cycle.' She also predicts thatRome will become a heap of ashes (this may be connected to another prophecy tothe effect that the Roman Catholic Church—and all others—will fail), and thatthe last Pope will be called Peter. She says that there is now a child in Asia,about ten years old, who will govern all the east. 'A more evil man has neverbeen born.' New York will be shaken by a great earthquake. 'This will be causedby the rising of the east coast out of the water; this will cause a tidal wave,and Ireland will be covered by water.' (Edgar Cayce, the American healer andprophet, made similar predictions about the east coast of America.) The Chinesewill conquer Europe as far as Scandinavia and most of the populations of Italyand Austria will be wiped out by aerial weapons. Another entry reads: 'May 1969:A new planet will be discovered at the end of 1970—there may be another onelater on. Nov. 197x: This was verified on TV last week.' A later entry clarifiesthis: '3 Jan. 73: Outer planet, Poseidon, confirmed as belonging to our system.Theory of explosion within our system confirmed, as theory of our scientists toexplain odd orbit of Poseidon and last two planets.'From my point of view, the 'religious' parts of her writing were the leastinteresting. 'Each man must follow his own path to God, and there is no one way.Only his own personal way—and this Christ will teach him when he opens his mindand heart to him.' True, no doubt, but it could have been written by anybody.Altogether more interesting was the description of direct experience scatteredamong the pages. This, for example:'I, too, was once the same; I did not believe anything but the evidence of myown senses. Yet something pulled at my heart, and I was not happy. I longed tobelieve in something or someone; I also wanted to know why the universe was, whymen were, and what for, and why we were born, and died, and where did we go whenwe died? ... There was a reason, I knew there must be. No one would go to thetrouble of creating a universe for no reason. So I tried to reach this Person bytalking to Him. I spoke in my own way, being essentially a simple and directperson ... I told this Person what was troubling me, I said I wanted to know,and was willing to learn, and I would work hard to understand, if He would tellme. He said: \"First, you must be tried... \"He told me to meet Him every day atthe same hour. This I did most faithfully, and little by little, he taught meand trained me, until I reached the point where I cannot learn more until I passover into the soul world.' She adds that 'He' speaks into the mind, like asilent whisper, which has the effect of filling her with joy.In another place, she describes how she was taught astral projection. 'I was torest flat upon either a bed, divan or floor, supported by a pillow—if necessarycovered by a quilt. Then to begin recollection—this was in the early days. LaterI relaxed through habit and began meditation immediately: first step:concentration upon mind, relax the body; it becomes still and heavy. Secondstep: the mind slowly begins to become quiet, the breathing slows. Concentrationinto the direct center of conscious mind—it stills and smoothes out.Concentration has forgotten body, and is entirely closed into the center ofmind. The mind stills, and becomes smooth as a still pond, then stops. This isthe point where one looks into a silence, or darkness... yet it is not darkness,but a light so intense as to blind one, and one sees darkness. There one ispoised and utterly still, intense concentration, and listening intensely. Andone waits and waits and waits. Sometimes there is nothing but an answeringwarmth. Sometimes a voice speaks and one sees exactly what is said. If one isneeded for a lesson, or some other reason, this is the point where I leave thebody. First there is a short blank, and then I am fully conscious beside mybody. At first the second body was nude, but I was taught to will it clothed.Occasionally, I would pass other souls who were unconscious, and at timesbeginners who were not clothed, but answering a summons—one can always tell.'Well, all this was fairly plain, and what I now needed was to talk further withMrs Beattie to clarify and enlarge. I met her off the train at St Austell on aFriday evening. On the journey home, she talked about her son John, his wife andchildren, and various other practical matters; she seemed to have no inclinationto talk about her writing. But she confirmed that much of it was 'automatic':that she felt a sudden impulse to sit down and begin to write; her handtwitched, and as soon as she seized a pen, it began writing.Back home, she met Joy and my three children. The youngest, then less than ayear old, wasn't much interested in strangers, but the other two—aged six andeleven—took to her immediately. My six-year-old son Damon seemed to accept heras a kind of extra grandmother, and lost no time in climbing on her anddemanding stories. Obviously, as far as the children were concerned, her'vibrations' were good. Sally, who had overheard me telling Joy about MrsBeattie's feats of astral projection, immediately began asking her questionsabout it. Mrs Beattie answered factually, without evasion or embarrassment. Igot the feeling that Sally thought it was all a bit weird, but not 'scary'. Asthe daughter of a writer, she gets used to meeting all kinds of people.There is not much to tell about that weekend. I didn't want to ask lots ofquestions unless she obviously wanted to talk; and as she seemed quite contentedto play with the children and talk to Joy, I didn't press it. It was just amatter of getting to know her, and letting things happen. She didn't seem tohave any faddist preferences. She ate meat, and when we took her to the localpub on Saturday evening, she drank Moselle wine with me. There was only one oddevent. As she was sitting opposite me, on the settee, her right hand began tojump about, rather in the way your leg twitches if a doctor strikes the knee totest your reflexes. Pointing to it with her other hand, she said: 'Look,someone's trying to get through.' 'Who?' 'I don't know. That's how it usuallyhappens.' She went on talking, and the hand continued to twitch. At this point,Sally, who was watching it with interest, got a pencil and notepad, and askedher to see what 'they' wanted. She took the pencil, and began to scribble, in anodd, jerky way. After thirty seconds or so, she read it, wrinkled her nose, andhanded it to me. It certainly didn't seem to make sense. 'Hearken unto me,'repeated three times, and then some such message as 'I am that which iseternal.' (Unfortunately, although we kept the paper, it has got mislaid.) The'Hearken unto me' made it sound like some religious crank with a desire to beheard, but nothing much to say. I asked her: 'Do you often get messages likethat?' She shrugged. 'Sometimes. Sometimes it doesn't make sense.' Over the nextfew minutes, as she talked,her hand twitched periodically, but she ignored it,as if it was a telephone she didn't want to answer... Which led me to reflectthat the 'spirit world' obviously has its nuts and cranks too, its persistenttalkers who are convinced they have something of world-shattering significanceto communicate, when all they really want is attention. An interestingthought—that perhaps even disembodied spirits may be unfulfilled neurotics... Oris it possible that some of these voices are from Mrs Beattie's subconscious? Isuspect she would say no, for the subconscious mind plays a definite part in hersystem of ideas... I have always been fascinated by the way the subconscious canthrow up ideas and images that seem totally independent of the consciouspersonality. For example, on the edge of sleep, the images and thoughts thatwash through the mind seem to be as objective as the sea, coming from somewhereelse, not from your own memory banks...When I drove Mrs Beattie to the station on the following Monday morning, I stillhadn't made up my mind about her. It would have been all very straightforward ifshe had been one of Yeats's simple, illiterate peasant women; then there wouldbe no doubt that everything she wrote came from somewhere outside her ownconscious mind. But she struck me as a fairly acute and astute person, and inmuch of her writing, she speaks with a direct personal voice—as in the passagesquoted above. If these are not 'automatic writing', then where does the personalwriting end and the 'dictated writing' begin?At which point, it is necessary to make some general comments on 'automaticwriting'. And the first thing that must be said flatly is that no spiritmessage, whether received via a medium, automatic script, or even on recordedtape (as in Constantin Raudive's experiments) has ever said anything of profoundimportance. As far as I know, there is no automatic script on record that saysanything that the actual writer (i.e. the person holding the pencil) would nothave been capable of saying. The London housewife, Mrs Rosemary Brown, hasproduced many piano works which she believes are dictated by dead composers suchas Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, and it seems to me highly unlikely that she is afraud.[1] On the other hand, she has not produced a single piece that can beseriously compared with the best of these composers. If she could produce apiece of Chopin or Liszt as popular as the Minute Waltz or Liebestraum she wouldconvert thousands of skeptics. She is now apparently engaged in taking downBeethoven's Tenth symphony from the composer's dictation; an excitingprospect—but experience tells me that it will be a noisy, pretentious piece witha few echoes of the Fifth and Ninth symphonies.In Modern Spiritualism (1902), Frank Podmore (one of the founders of the SPR)has several chapters on automatic writing, trance utterance, and so on. Mrs CoraTappan of America could produce an incredible flow of words, both in prose andverse, and it usually 'made sense'; but the extracts Podmore quotes never riseabove the inspiration, say, of Hymns Ancient and Modern. A spirit who professedto be Francis Bacon asked whether 'in the whole history of written thought thereis anything that can approach [his trance utterances] in ' the magnitude of theideas or the profundity of the thoughts', and a believer, named Tallmadgeadmitted that 'their equal never proceeded from mortal man'. A glance at someexamples of 'Bacon's' eloquence and profundity is a letdown:'How glorious that man's destiny! He leaves behind the errors of time, andboldly pushing forward through the untried future, he plants his standard on thevery outward wall of eternity, and here he makes his stand... 'And so on and so on, with the cliches clashing like cymbals. The spirits give noevidence whatever of the kind of sharpness of mind that we associate withgenius. It is all woolly and bombastic. One single cutting verse by the spiritof Heine would carry more conviction than reams of pseudo-Bacon. In my ownopinion, it requires a certain degree of self-deception to see anything veryremarkable in most 'spirit teachings' or messages from the dead. I can think ofonly one occasion when the results were well above the usual standard: in thatcurious automatic script that W. B. Yeats published under the title of A Vision.With its complicated explanation of how different types of human charactercorrespond to different phases of the moon, this is a work of considerablefascination. Yeats' biographers generally accept his story that his wife Georgewrote down most of the book at the dictation of 'spirits'; the fact remains thatit is the kind of thing Yeats might have written as an exercise in cosmologicalspeculation, and there is not a word in it that Yeats could not have written.Am I suggesting that all automatic writing is fraud? Not for a moment. It ispossible that only the subconscious mind is involved—or perhaps the'superconscious' that Robert Leftwich speaks of. But in that case, it would bereasonable to suppose that all so-called 'spirit phenomena' are purelysubjective—springing from unseen depths of the human mind—and the evidence isagainst that. On the whole, the weight of evidence suggests that communicationwith the dead explains various spirit messages at least as well as thehypothesis of fraud or telepathy. (I have discussed this at length in TheOccult.} So automatic writing finds itself in an embarrassing kind of limbo:never totally convincing, but much too convincing to be dismissed as fraud orself-deception. In most spirit writing (or painting, or, in the case of RosemaryBrown, music) the evidence is on the side of subconscious mental activity. Forexample, a great deal of 'spirit painting' has more merit—and talent—than thepainter is able to call upon when painting normally and consciously; but in viewof our tendency to under-utilize our powers (discussed earlier), this is what wemight expect.So when I settled down to studying Mrs Beattie's manuscripts, I had noexpectation of discovering profound revelations. And I didn't find any. Butthere were a great many keen insights, some of them exciting: 'When RogerBannister ran the four-minute mile, he made it possible for all men to do it.Since that time, many have done so—the potential for this had always been there,but no one else had tried it; the time had not yet come. So it is with allthings, in the way of evolution.' That struck me as way above the level of theeloquence and profundity of 'Francis Bacon'. It is an oddity that has beenobserved by writers on mountaineering. First a mountain is regarded asunclimbable; men die in the attempt. Then someone succeeds; and within a coupleof decades, Sunday school teachers are taking parties of children up it.On the other hand, there were misunderstandings. 'Ouspensky says: \"The soul andthe future life are one and the same.\" It is imperative to keep our souls, if weare to win eternal life... ' But Ouspensky was saying something much profounderthan that. He meant that man is a fragmented creature with thousands of '/V, allreplacing one another minute by minute. How can such a creature have a 'future'?His future is shared out between a thousand selves. In the same way, how can hebe said to have a soul? He has a thousand fragments of soul, like a shatteredmirror. So to achieve unity (a single 'self or soul) would also entail having areal future.On the other hand, the spirit generally pervading the manuscript is close tothat of Ramakrishna, the Hindu saint who went into a state of samadhi (ecstasy)at the mere mention of the name 'God' or 'Krishna'. 'Tell yourself that God isgood, unchangeably good. That He exists in you, and that without Him you couldnot exist at all. Feel a desire to unite with Him, so that He may expressHimself through you. Feel God as love.' The words are trite, but the overallimpression is of a genuine, deep, strong religious impulse, not of someonerepeating religious platitudes. There is a strong overall feeling ofgenuineness.' The insights are real: for example, the recognition that mosthuman beings are hopelessly passive, failing to recognize that 'all power comesfrom within', and that 'we are weak only when we fail to recognize this'. Thisis, of course, the same basic recognition as in Robert Leftwich's book. And onceI had noted this similarity, I noted many others: the insistence on theimportance of discipline and responsibility, for example. She writes of thenecessities for spiritual evolution: to lead an ordered life, to keep the bodyas fit as possible, and not to 'use it to excess', to accept obligations tofamily and society, and take up a profession according to our capacities. Nooutsider-ish 'opting out', no'Do what you will, this world's a fiction And is made up of contradiction...'Again, she agrees with Leftwich that it is necessary to 'retire' in order to beable to devote time to thinking and self-knowledge. 'Since retirement I live asecluded life, a kind of contemplative life. It would not be possible to livethe normal everyday working life full-time and to be able to have this kind ofinner-experience. This is not possible; which is why, I think, I was able toleave the body only before and after I had ceased to live a full emotional sexlife and a full-time working life. All levels of consciousness, as well as thethree bodies, have to be in alignment, in harmony, at rest, before realcontemplative experience is possible.' Passages like this have a definite senseof authenticity.Certain phrases—like the reference to the three bodies—puzzled me. When I askedMrs Beattie about them, she would refer me back to the manuscript, saying theywere explained there; but I couldn't see them, or the explanations were mixed upwith other matters, which confused me. So the next time she came over for aweekend, I asked her to sit down and talk into a tape recorder, giving medetails of her life, and an outline of her basic ideas.Eunice Beattie was born in Bangor, North Wales, and grew up on a nearbyfarm—which had been in her family for generations. (I was surprised to realizeshe was Welsh—she has no trace of the accent.) It was interesting to realize shewas a Celt. There was a tradition in her family (although she admits she is notsure whether there is any truth in it) that one member of each generation shouldbecome a hermit, and a kind of priest. The 'religion', as she described it,sounded like some curious survival of paganism; the family would go to some kindof stone circle near the farm, and perform a harvest festival type of ceremonythat involved placing wheat, honey and water on a flat stone which served as analtar. (Note that the harvest festival, as known in English churches today, wasintroduced in the nineteenth century by the Rev. R. S. Hawker, the poet andsmuggler of Morwenstow.) A prayer was offered in Welsh. And just beforeChristmas, the family decorated a cauldron, known as Ceridwen's cauldron, withholly. This sounds like the kind of semi-pagan survival described by MargaretMurray, although Mrs Beattie insists that it was a simple religious ceremony,nothing to do with witchcraft.Her childhood was completely normal—attending school, working on the farm (withher brothers and sisters). She was always lonely, and regarded by the rest ofthe family as delicate, although she only suffered the usual childish illnesses.It was at sixteen that she had her first unusual experience. One night, justbefore dawn, she woke up and found herself standing beside her bed, and lookingdown on her body which lay in the bed. There was a man standing beside her—orrather a figure, whose body seemed to be an area of luminosity. She could onlysee his head, although this was not particularly clear. This 'man' she refers toas her teacher. He told her that he had brought her out of her body, and that hewanted to warn her that she would have a serious accident within two weeks.Precisely fourteen days later, the brakes on her bicycle failed and she wasthrown into a brick wall; she spent several weeks in hospital. I wondered whyher teacher couldn't simply have warned her to have her brakes looked at by thelocal repairman, but she went on a moment later to say that the accident, andthe period in hospital, were essential to her evolution. This is an interestingpoint. Many 'psychics' have started their careers with an accident or seriousillness. (In The Occult, I have cited the well-authenticated case of PeterHurkos, who became psychic after receiving a serious head injury when he felloff a ladder; when he woke up in hospital, he found he could read people'sthoughts and 'see' their future.)Subsequently, she had many experiences of astral projection. At this point, sheexplained the puzzling business of the 'three bodies'. There is, apart from thephysical body, an electromagnetic (or energy) body, and the 'astral' body (whichshe prefers to call the emotional or soul-body). The energy body would seem tobe what Harold Burr measures with his voltmeters, and what the Kirlian devicedetects. The astral body is the body that travels—perhaps Robert Leftwich'ssuperconscious. The energy body hovers above the physical body when it isunconscious—or anesthetized. Mrs Beattie said she had often seen this in theoperating theatre. (The psychic Phoebe Payne, quoted in The Occult, was alsoable to see the 'auras' of flowers and animals. The inference would seem to bethat people like Mrs Beattie and Phoebe Payne have a sense that can detect the'energy body' like the Kirlian device.) The aura, in a healthy person, spreadsout about a foot beyond the physical body, and it radiates variouscolors—depending on the consciousness of the individual. When the individual istired, the aura dims.She laid a gear deal of stress on this matter of vital energy. I found itinteresting because I had recently been fascinated by an account of experimentscarried out at McGill University, as described in Lyall Watson's important bookSupernature. Barley seeds were treated with salt and baked in an oven—but notlong enough to kill them. They were then planted, and some were treated withwater which had been held for thirty minutes per day by a known 'healer'. Theplants treated with this water gave appreciably better results than thosetreated with ordinary tap water. Moreover, when the water was 'treated' by awoman suffering from severe depression, and a man with psychotic tendencies, thegrowth of the seeds was notably retarded. These experiments by Bernard Grad,which seem to confirm the findings of Harold Burr, also fit the pattern of MrsBeattie's own insights into the subject of vital energy. (Oddly enough, chemicalanalysis of the water treated by 'healers' revealed a slight spreading betweenthe hydrogen and oxygen atoms.)This led Mrs Beattie to make some comments on negative people and'vampirism'—the way that some people can drain your energy, so you feelcompletely worn out after half an hour with them. It was phenomenon, she said,that she had often noted when working on old people's wards. They would get intoa thoroughly negative state of mind, and drain the energy of anyone who workedon the ward. I asked her whether the negative attitude causes their sickness, orvice versa. I could guess what her answer would be, and I was right: that mostsickness is caused by 'negativity', and begins with the energy body, which thenaffects the physical body. 'The mind affects the emotions, the emotions affectthe energy, the energy affects the physical body.'The effect of her accident at sixteen was to give her certain powers of insight,of the same type as Peter Hurkos'. She found that she often knew about peoplesimply by looking at them, and found that by looking at their hands—or the tealeaves left in their cups—she was able to describe their lives and foretell thefuture. This was 'instinctive', she said—and it sounds, as she describes it, notunlike Robert Leftwich's description of dowsing. At a later stage, these powersdiminished, although they never faded. She had no definite idea of what shewanted to do when she grew up—only that she didn't want to marry a farmer andsettle down to existence as a housewife. When she thought about it, she wasinclined to feel that she would become a nurse or a nun. But by the time sheleft school, her father had left the farm and moved to Knowsley, near Liverpool,where he took over a market garden on Lord Derby's estate. Eunice worked for herfather—tending greenhouses, wrapping flowers. From the family's point of view,the change was a success; her father proved to be a good market gardener, andthe business prospered. From Eunice's point of view, it was less satisfactory;after farm life in Wales, she found the English too practical and down to earth.It was lucky that she could work for her father. The out-of-the-body experiencescontinued to happen periodically, preceded by a feeling of introspection, adesire to 'sink into herself. She told no one of these experiences. She alsodecided, at a fairly early stage, that it was important to keep theseexperiences secret; she felt that this was essential if she was to live a normallife. At the age of 22%, she was ready to leave home; she wanted to get as faraway as possible. So she answered an advertisement to become a nurse—aprobationer—at a hospital at Kingston on Thames. At that time, hospital work wasa vocation rather than a career. Pay was minimal; they had to work long hours,and buy their own uniforms. But it was about the only vocation—apart from anunnery—that suited her temperament. The problem, as always, was simply amountof work involved; she would be so exhausted at the end of a day that there wasno time for spiritual adventures.As she described all this to me, I found myself forming a definite picture ofwhat was involved, and realizing that, in a way, it was not so very differentfrom my own teens and early twenties—or, for that matter, from anybody who hasthis romantic impulse to escape from the world. Thomas Mann's novel Buddenbrookscontains a classic portrait of the 'artist as a young man', and the chapter onHanno's visits to the seaside—as a child—is particularly powerful: the sense ofrelease, the peace, the delight, the freedom, of wide beaches, seaweed on therocks, anemones in pools, hours of lying quietly on the sand, 'while you letyour eyes rove idly and lose themselves in the green and blue infinity beyond.There was the air that swept in from that infinity—strong, free, wild, gentlysighing and deliciously scented; it seemed to enfold you round, to veil yourhearing and make you pleasantly giddy, and blessedly submerge all consciousnessof time and space.' And I can recall, at fifteen or sixteen, spending eveningsreading poetry in my bedroom,while all the tensions gradually relaxed out of thesoul, until you felt tired, but completely serene and free, like someone who isconvalescing from a dangerous illness. Thomas Mann felt that this capacity fortotal relaxation, the longing for 'dim hills and far horizons', makes one unfitfor normal life; it is almost inevitable that Hanno should die young. MrsBeattie always been made of stronger stuff; she has always been prepared to livea normal life and work for a living...What I am now suggesting—with no certainty of being on the right track—is thatthe forces that were struggling to find an outlet in her were very much the sameforces that produce all literature and art. They seek out whatever channels areavailable to them. Yeats' imagination turned to fairy lands and the world of theoccult. A young Cornishman named Leslie Rowse—from a working-classbackground—managed to win a scholarship to Oxford, and became a historian,finding in the study of the past the same release that Yeats found his fairylands. Einstein found the same release in the world of stars and atoms; Freud inthe dark waters of the unconscious. But poets and artists and scientists have apath to follow; once they have seen it, all they have to do is stick to it. Agirl brought up to feed chickens and tend flowers had no comparable outlet; thecreative energies turned inwards. A Freudian would talk about 'compensations',even of sexual unfullfilment, and there I think he would be wrong. Mrs Beattiesaid wryly that she always thought of herself as an old maid; but she admittedthat, as a teenager, and as a nurse, she had flirtations and occasionally wentout with boys. She would be unlikely to meet anyone like herself in the hospitalmilieu; so the lack of interest in sex was basically a failure to find anyonewho appealed to her as an ideal.In fact, she did marry eventually. During the war—by which time she was workingas a district nurse in Liverpool—she met an RAF man in a bus queue just as thesirens were sounding for an air raid; they got into conversation; he saw herhome, and eventually, they married. Marriage didn't suit her; it was not whatshe was looking for. Almost immediately she felt she had done the wrong thing,and her inner life marked time. In 1947, her son John was born. Some two yearslater, her husband, who had taken a job with the Ministry of Supply, was killedwhen he was taking a car out on test. 'It was an emotional shock, but I supposeit was a kind of relief as well.' I don't think the comment indicatesheartlessness. Her life so far had given her few opportunities forself-expression, self-development—what Maslow would call self-actualization.Work as a nurse was far from ideal, long hours of patrolling wards, changingsheets, emptying bedpans; and being a district nurse, while it was moreinteresting, was also non-stop hard work. She tried marriage and realized it wasanother cul-de-sac, as far as self-actualization was concerned (although she wasa doting mother).From the practical point of view, the death of her husband meant loss ofsecurity. She had been working in a hospital (Bootle Maternity) during hermarriage; now she decided to become a district nurse again. When John was ten,she decided to widen her field to social work, specializing in children. Thiswas the most rewarding work she had done so far. John was at school in areligious community in Shropshire; she enjoyed social work, and the variety ofpeople it brought her into contact with. The same insight that had enabled herto tell fortunes now made her a good social worker. Finally, she moved toPlymouth—to Freedom Fields Hospital—and became a sister in the maternity unit.She was there until her retirement three years ago. And now, after forty years,she at last had the freedom to pursue her 'habit' (as she once called it): thatcapacity to retire deep into herself, achieve a state of inner serenity, andthen leave the body. At no stage has she regarded herself as a 'psychic' orpotential medium; the evolutionary preoccupation has always been there. These'astral' activities were strictly for the purpose of self-actualization. Herview was confirmed in discussion with Father Trevor Huddleston, who agreed thattoo much preoccupation with the 'psychic' could place an obstacle in the way ofspiritual progress.By this time, the skeptically inclined reader will be asking why I shouldbelieve a single word she told me, since she offered no 'proof of any unusualpower? And I can only say: because most of what she said 'fitted in' to things Ialready knew or suspected. I was groping my way towards some general theory of'hidden powers' and astral projection, trying to relate them back to knownpsychological facts.My basic assumption is that we possess ranges of power that we do not suspect.Anybody who has ever bought some gadget—like a tape recorder—knows that it isnecessary to read the handbook before you can fully understand all the thingsyou can do with it. If you don't read the handbook, you may have it for yearswithout realizing that a certain button will enable you to superimpose onerecording on another, or that a socket is intended for an earphone thatautomatically cuts out the main loudspeaker... Human beings come withoutinstruction books, and we have to find out our potentialities by trial anderror. And since most of us lack the exploratory urge, we never discover all ourcapacities. To take a simple example: most of us can wake up at a certaindefinite hour if we have to, as if we possessed some inner alarm clock; but, asfar as I know, no psychologist has ever conducted an investigation into this'power', to find out how it works. Again, we have all experienced 'second wind',the ability to call upon vital reserves; but no one knows where these vitalreserves are stored.Now the power to 'retreat within oneself is one of our most interesting humancapacities. I do not mean simply to go off into a daydream; most daydreaming isa negative thing, a kind of inattention, a 'switching off, a form of loss ofmemory. On the other hand, a child sometimes becomes so completely absorbed in abook that it is just as if he has retreated to a room inside himself. You canoften see it in a young mother breast-feeding a baby; it is as if she and thebaby had retreated into an inner-room. In Wolf Solent, John Cowper Powysdescribes Wolfs 'trick of sinking into his soul', which Wolf calls his'mythology'.' Powys describes it as 'a device that supplied him with the secretsubstratum of his whole life'.'This \"sinking into his soul\"... consisted of a certain summing-up, to thesurface of his mind, of a subconscious magnetic power which... as he watched theglitter of sun and moon upon the waters from that bow window, had seemedprepared to answer such a summons.'In the later novel Porius, Powys invents yet another word for this ability,'cavoseniargising', which he describes as:'... those recurrent moments in his life when the gulf between the animalconsciousness of his body ... and the consciousness of his restless soul wastemporarily bridged; so that his soul found itself able to follow every curveand ripple of his bodily sensations, and yet remain suspended above them...\"(Porius, p. 83).This process of self-withdrawal is undoubtedly one of the major unexploredsecrets of human nature. And the discovery of psychedelic drugs in the lateforties suggested some interesting new methods of exploration. Aldous Huxley wasthe first to assert, in his two books on the mescaline experience, that man's'inner landscapes' could be as vast and as varied as the surface of the earth.Since then, there have been many attempts to chart this inner world. One of themost interesting—because the most reasonable and logical—is The Center of theCyclone, by John Lilly. Dr Lilly is a scientist, whose early work on the mind ofthe dolphin attracted considerable attention. Later on, he experimented withsensory deprivation in a tank of lukewarm water, and experienced dream-likestates, trance-like states, mystical states. It was during the course of theseexperiments that he began to have experiences which could have been delusions,but which seemed to have a certain authenticity: a feeling of apparently beingjoined by other people in the dark, floating environment, and times when heapparently tuned in on networks of communication that are normally below ourlevels of awareness, networks of civilizations 'way beyond ours'. He decided totry the effect of LSD—lysergic acid—in the water-tank. He describes how, in thisfirst experiment, there was a sense of completely black, completely silent,empty space without a body. He called it the 'zero point', and says: 'I wish toemphasize that this zero point was not in the body, it was out in the universeof nothing except silence and blackness...' A positivist would say this is justquibbling with words; he was still 'in his body', even if his imaginationproduced a sensation of outer space. The positivist could be right; but I am notsure. According to Mrs Beattie, this is the state in which the 'astral body' maypass out of the physical body. Is this, perhaps, the meaning of that curiouspassage at the beginning of Blake's Europe:Five windows light the cavern'd Man; thro' one he breathes the air; Thro' onehears music of the spheres; thro' one the eternal vine Flourishes, that he mayreceive the grapes; thro' one can look And see small portions of the eternalworld that ever groweth; Thro' one himself pass out what time he please; but hewill not, For stolen joys are sweet, and bread eaten in secret pleasant.'The opening lines are clear enough—they obviously refer to the five senses. Butwhat is this 'window through which man can pass out what time he please'? Andwhat is the meaning of the odd line about stolen joys and bread 'eaten insecret'? Is this now Powys' 'cavoseniargising' or 'mythologising', withdrawingdeep into some secret place? Is Blake saying that this is the route to passingout of the body?The interesting thing about John Lilly's book is that he quite obviouslybelieves that his strange experiences under LSD were more than 'imagination'.And he continues to emphasize the distinction between being 'in' his body andout of it.'Then I became intensely exhilarated and went into a high while in my body. Igot out of the tank and went out into the sunlight, looking up into the sky,savoring the fact that I was a human being on a planet. For the first time sincechildhood, life was precious. My body was precious. My feelings of energy andextreme exhilaration continued. I sat and contemplated the wonder of ourcreation, of the creation of our planet. An hour or so later, I climbed backinto the tank and launched into other regions. I had had enough of the vastspaces, the vast entities for a while. Now I attempted to contact other systemsof life, more on a level with our own, and yet alien to us. I moved into aregion of strange life forms, neither above nor below the human level, butstrange beings, of strange shapes, metabolism, thought forms and so forth... Thevast variety of possible forms in the universe passed before me.'Earlier in the book, John Lilly describes a crucial experience in which he cameclose to losing his life. In giving himself an antibiotic injection, he alsoinjected a small quantity of detergent into his blood the syringe had not beenthoroughly cleaned out; the bubbles lodged in his brain, and he went into acoma. Fortunately, he was taken to a hospital where he was known, and eventuallyrecovered. While in a coma, waiting for the ambulance, he had a sensation ofcoming into contact with two 'guardians':'The pounding headache, the nausea and the vomiting that occurred forced me toleave my body. I became a focussed center of consciousness and traveled intoother spaces and met other beings, entities, or consciousnesses. I came acrosstwo who approached me through a large empty space, and who looked, felt andtransmitted guiding and teaching thoughts to me.' He says of them: 'I realizethat they are beings far greater than I. They begin to teach me. They tell me Ican stay in this place, that I have left my body, that I can return to it if Iwish. They then show me what would happen if I left my body back there—analternative path for me to take.. .They tell me it is not yet time for me toleave my body permanently, and that I still have an option to go back to it.They give me total and absolute confidence, total certitude in the truth of mybeing in this state. I know with certainty that they exist... ' And he adds:'They say that they are my guardians, that they have been with me before atcritical times, and that in fact they are with me always, but that I am notusually in a state to perceive them.'Again, much of this sounded familiar to me. For example, a man named Ed Morrell,who was confined in a straitjacket in a prison in Arizona. In fact, thetreatment—designed to break the spirit of 'tough' prisoners—was to lace themtightly in two straitjackets, one outside the other, and then pour water on themso they would shrink. It was like being 'slowly squeezed to death by a boaconstrictor'. But at the height of the pain, he suddenly found himself wanderingaround outside the prison. Summarizing this case in The Phenomena of AstralProjection, Muldoon and Carrington declare that while 'projecting', Morrell metthe Governor of the State, George W. P. Hunt, who was later able to verify whatMorrell had seen at the time. Jack London made Morrell the hero of his book TheStar Rover.Similarly, the medium Ena Twigg (whose contacts with the dead son of BishopJames Pike are summarized in The Occult} has described in her autobiography(Medium) how, as a child of two or three, she could fly up and down the stairsafter her body had been put to bed. She was always aware of entities who wereapparently invisible to other people; she named these 'misty people'. At the ageof fourteen, the 'misty people' told her that her father would be 'with them' ina week's time. Exactly a week later he slipped and fractured his skull, dying afew hours later. But until she was an adult, she remained only vaguely'psychic'. The turning point came with a serious illness—appendicitis. Underanaesthetic, she was aware of herself suspended above her body, looking down.The operation was not wholly successful; she failed to gain weight after it, andgradually became weaker. One day, three of her 'misty people' walked into thebedroom. They seemed to be doctors; one wrote down what she told him about hersymptoms; another gave her an injection in the base of the neck. The mark wasthere the next morning when she told her husband about the experience. The three'guardians' came weekly, and her health recovered. She asked them how she couldrepay them. 'By helping others.' They gave her the address of a spiritualistcircle.Cases like this obviously do nothing to disprove or confirm theindividual case of Mrs Beattie. A skeptic would say they were all liars orvictims of their imagination. On the other hand, if you accept that the sheerweight of the evidence tends to confirm that 'there are more things in heavenand earth' than Bertrand Russell ever suspected, then all these cases will beseen as part of a discernible pattern, and Mrs Beattie's claims fit into thispattern.On the second occasion Mrs Beattie came to stay with us, I asked her how she'dslept. She said she hadn't slept much, because she'd had to spend the nighthelping someone in Sheffield. I pressed for further details. She said she hadbeen 'summoned' to Sheffield, to help someone she had never met; the woman wasthinking of killing herself. Mrs Beattie's task was to soothe her by standingbeside her and pouring reassuring thoughts into her head. The guiding of theastral body, she said, was achieved by a kind of imaginative willing—a statementthat agrees with most writers who have described astral projection.Mrs Beatties observations struck me as rather more interesting than most of theaccounts contained in Muldoon and Carrington—which are simply straightforwarddescriptions of out-of-the-body experiences. She is very much preoccupied withthe evolutionary aspect of the whole experience. I had hoped to find aconsecutive account of her 'cosmology' in the manuscripts; but they moved fromsubject to subject. But here is a brief outline sketch, compiled from themanuscripts, and from her answers on tape:Human beings have three bodies: the physical body, the energy body and theastral (or soul-) body. All our memories are associated with the energy body.After death, the astral body is freed; the energy body remains in a state ofquiescence or unconsciousness for three days. The energy body is joined to thephysical body at the navel, and has its root in the liver. This body is alsocalled the Ka, the Egyptian word for it. The Ka remains with the physical bodyto keep it alive when the astral body travels. After death, the Ka graduallydisintegrates as the physical body decomposes; its memories are transferred tothe astral body at death. In cases of violent death, the astral body findsitself in a grey, misty place and feels confused and lost. Mrs Beattie has alsohelped to 'guide' these lost souls out of this limbo state. 'Ghosts' are notlost souls, but fragments of the energy body which have not disintegrated. Thishappens in cases of violent death, when the memory has not had time to betransferred to the soul-body.The astral body has awareness of the 'subconscious' mind. As human beingsachieve extension of consciousness, they also achieve a closer relation to thesubconscious mind. At a higher level still, the astral body is in contact withthe whole race memory, which can become available to it. Interestingly enough,Mrs Beattie says that she disbelieves in reincarnation. People who think theyhave glimpsed themselves in previous existences are actually contactingfragments of the race memory. This is a point on which she is in flatdisagreement with Arthur Guirdham, the subject of my next chapter. But it isonly fair to say that spiritualists in general disagree about this subject. Iasked Professor Wilson Knight if, next time he attended a seance, he would askabout reincarnation. He obliged me, and told me later that there seemed to be nogeneral agreement. Reincarnation probably did occur, but it was the exceptionrather than the rule.When Mrs Beattie was in our house, she picked up a book called A World Beyond byRuth Montgomery, purporting to be a description of the after-life, transmittedto Ruth Montgomery from the medium Arthur Ford, after his death. Mrs Beattieopened it at a page dealing with race memory, and showed it to me, saying 'Look,that's exactly what I was saying earlier.' It was; but on other points, there isconsiderable disagreement between Mrs Beattie's 'world beyond' and RuthMontgomery's. Ruth Montgomery states that reincarnation is definitely the rule,and that it is the means by which men work out 'evil karma' (although shedoesn't use this phrase). For example, a philanthropist who had an appallingdisfigurement on one side of his face had killed a child in a previous existenceby striking it with great violence in the same place...After death, the soul feels as if it is travelling down a long tunnel, and thenemerges into a region that is very much like this physical world. In a sense,they are still exactly the same person they were when alive; 'they don't becomespiritual just because they've died'. Evil souls may fall into a kind of limbo,an outer darkness. (Ruth Montgomery explains that Hitler has fallen into thisstate, but that he propelled himself into it. The paranoid self-assertioncontinued in the 'world beyond', but produced no effect, except increasingfrustration and fury in Hitler—producing a fragmented mental state likeinsanity... )From the 'ordinary' (or 'earthly') level, souls may evolve to a level in whichthey become involved in useful work (the 'guardians'?). Beyond this, there aretwo higher levels. All children—souls of those who have died young—congregate atthe third level. The fourth level is 'purely creative'. I found this slightlybaffling—after all, creativity can exist on any level—but Mrs Beattie explainedthat these four levels also exist in the minds of living people, i.e. we canevolve through these levels while still alive, and the level we have reacheddetermines our place in the 'world beyond'.At this point, Mrs Beattie made some comments that I did not fully understand.'We've got to grow, to balance the negative, unconscious forces. We've got tohave three extensions of consciousness in our conscious minds to balance thethree levels of unconscious forces.' She conceives the subconscious as negative.(Elsewhere in the manuscripts, there is an interesting table labeled 'Humanpolarization', which declares that in man, the physical body is positive, and inwoman, negative. The energy body in man is negative, and in woman, positive. Thesoul or astral body in man is positive, in woman, negative; and maleconsciousness is negative, while in woman, consciousness is positive. This, shesays, is why man and woman harmonize, complementing each other.) When I askedher to explain the three negative forces of the unconscious more fully, shereferred me to the manuscripts; but I have not been able to find anything.But it seems to me that the essence of Mrs Beattie's ideas is contained in aphrase she used when I asked her why some 'spiritual' people are completelynon-psychic. 'We make an inward journey, to find the truth of our own being. Yougo through the emotional soul level, and in so doing, you become aware of thepsychic level.'A lot of what she says puzzles me, or simply rings no bells at all. But thisphrase seemed to me to be of central importance: the inward journey. She saysseveral times in the manuscript that most people live on a purely physicallevel, unaware that this is only an imitation of real life. In her teens—perhapsearlier—she learned the trick of 'cavoseniargising', making the inward journey,focusing the inner-mind.Anybody can do this. Ed Morrell did it by focusing on pain. I have heard ofcases in which a similar act of focusing could bring a certain release. InAmerica, I met a young college teacher who said he could induce sudden intenseexperiences of joy, and that he had learned this trick as a boy, when he had tosit still in church. One day, when he had been fidgeting, his mother told him hewould be punished if he didn't stop it. Then he began to itch—I think he said itwas in the small of his back—and experienced an overwhelming desire to scratchit, which he had to resist. The itch became unbearable—then, as he concentratedon it, was suddenly replaced by an intense 'peak experience'.It is not necessary to focus on pain. If I settle down to read a book that Ihave been trying to obtain for a long time, or to listen to some music that Ireally want to hear, I relax completely, and prepare to devote my fullestattention to the act of focusing; and it is this that leads to states ofabsorption that resemble the mystic's contemplation. Such an act ofconcentration on one thing also refreshes us; no matter how weary I feel, if Ibecome deeply interested in something, my energies slowly return. I recall, atthe age of fifteen or so, cycling nearly fifty miles to Matlock Bath, inDerbyshire, and arriving there worn out. I felt that all I wanted to do was tolie down and sleep; instead, we paid our shillings and went on a guided tour ofthe deep caves that run below the limestone hills. It involved a great deal ofwalking and scrambling; yet we came out as relaxed and refreshed as if we'd hada good night's sleep. The proper use of our energies depends on this power todirect them—or rather, direct the attention—to new regions of the mind. This isthe way 'mental voyages' are made; this is the way in which we explore ourhidden powers. This is the reason people seek pleasure—because pleasure has thepower to direct the mind in a single direction. And such a 'focusing' is,literally, a voyage. After a short time, we find ourselves in new mental realms,just as if we were exploring a road, and when we look back, we have an odd senseof being far from home—or at least, from the starting point.For me, what is important about Mrs Beattie is not her claim to be able toproject the astral body, or her descriptions of the after-life. I am unable tojudge these, not having any basis of personal experience to go on. But it seemsdear to me that the rather odd, introspective girl who was brought up on a Welshfarm, developed the same power that all artists and poets possess: the power tomake 'inward journeys'... and perhaps developed it to a greater extent thanmost. An artist might regard her as an artist manque, but it seems to me thatshe would have as much right to regard the artist as a 'psychic manque\". Bothbelong to the group of 'inward voyagers'. Mrs Beattie is not a philosopher; butthe central idea that emerges from her work is the basis of modernexistentialist philosophy: Kirkegaard's recognition that 'truth issubjectivity'. But, expressed in this way, we fail to grasp its significance.What we are talking about is a real power that is possessed by human beings: thepower to evolve by a process of 'inner voyage'.She herself has a rather skeptical attitude towards a great deal of what she haswritten, and is obviously not sure how much of it comes from her own mind, andhow much from 'outside'. She writes in her notes: 'The things I have writtenfrom time to time, when the mood was on me, seem to me not typical of me. Someis too donnish, other pieces are too sentimental. (It all has a religiousbackground, which is, of course, me.) But I rather suspect the other material,which is why I don't know what to do with it. It's all broken up...'This may be true, but it does not matter. What is significant about her is thatshe has learned the trick of making 'inner voyages' without the aid of awater-tank or psychedelic drugs, and she demonstrates that it can be done. Ithink that she is right to believe that she has taken a step along the road thatleads to the next phase of human evolution."},{"pageContent":"ThreeDR ARTHUR GUIRDHAMI had just completed The Occult—some time around August 1970—when I saw a reviewof a book called The Cathars and Reincarnation by Arthur Guirdham. It was ashort review, but it said that it was probably the best authenticated case ofreincarnation on record. So I hastened to buy the book, which was published bySpearman—a firm that seemed to have succeeded Rider as England's chief 'occult'publishers.The book arrived in mid-September. It had a sub-title: 'The record of a pastlife in 13th century France'. I settled down to read it; from the blurb, itsounded fascinating.My first impression was of disappointment. It began by stating that one of thewriter's patients—he was a doctor—had written down all kinds of details aboutthe Cathars, a heretical sect of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and thatat the time she wrote, most of these details were unknown to scholars. Sincethat time—twenty-six years ago—many of these details have been verified, said DrGuirdham.He certainly had my attention. In fact, it seemed fairly clear to me that he hadthe material of a best-seller. All he had to do was to tell his story simply, inchronological sequence.Unfortunately, this was precisely what he didn't do. His style was clear enough,but he got involved in all kinds of minor details about the Cathars andthirteenth-century France until I was completely bogged down. What it needed wasto tell the reader, in words of one syllable, exactly who the Cathars were, andtheir history up to the time of their destruction by the Inquisition. And then,step by step, to tell the story of his patient, whom he calls Mrs Smith, andshow how it corresponded in detail with what is known of the Cathars inLanguedoc in the middle of the thirteenth century—particularly of the murder ofthe two Inquisitors at Avignonet in 1242, which led to the great persecution ofCathars, culminating in the massacre of Montsegur.On the other hand, the very fact that he hadn't tried to turn the book intoanother Search for Bridey Murphy was evidence for the genuineness of the book. Igot the impression that, as a doctor, he was slightly embarrassed by thesensational nature of the material he was presenting, and was anxious to presentit as soberly as possible.The story presented in The Cathars and Reincarnation is, briefly, as follows:Throughout his adult life, Arthur Guirdham has felt a strong attraction to theheretical sect known as the Cathars, or 'pure ones'. Their basic doctrine wassimilar to that of the Manichees and the Gnostics: that this world is the domainof Satan, and that human beings are the spirits of angels who revolted againstGod, and who have been condemned to spend a lifetime imprisoned in the body.This world is hell, created by the devil. A man's only chance of redemption isto become united with Christ in this life, to become completely pure.The Catholic Church has always been inclined to condemn this type of doctrine;to begin with, the Bible says that God looked at the world and saw that it wasgood. Second, the majority of clerics, from priests to popes, have been ordinaryhuman beings, lacking in fanaticism; the Savonarolas and Cornelius Jansensstrike them as slightly nutty. On the other hand, intense natures long to evolveat a faster rate than the Church makes provision for, and this has been thesource of all the Church's troubles, from Chrysostom to Luther. The 'purists',the fanatics, are a nuisance and a menace. Purist doctrines always made theirstrongest appeal in times of universal hardship and suffering; and at the timeof the second Crusade, there was plenty of hardship and suffering in Europe.Trouble began after 1174, when St Bernard preached against the Cathars inToulouse, which was virtually their capital city; Count Raymond of Toulouse wasa Cathar. In 1205, a monk called Dominic Guzman—later Saint Dominic—began hisown personal crusade against the Cathars, wandering around barefoot andpreaching against them. His followers—the Dominicans—were later given the job ofrooting out Catharism, and became known as the Inquisition. In 1204, the popeasked the king of France to depose Count Raymond and place a good Catholic inhis position. In 1208, one of Raymond's squires retaliated by assassinating thepapal legate; the pope was so furious that he couldn't speak for two days. Andthe first 'crusade' against the Cathars began in 1209. Twenty thousand peoplewere massacred at Beziers. Simon de Montfort (senior—father of the founder ofEnglish democracy) was a particularly violent persecutor. He plundered Toulousein 1215. The slaughter and persecution went on, with Toulouse changing hands,for the next thirty years. But the beginning of the end happened in 1242, whenthe two Inquisitors were betrayed by their host, and murdered. In 1243, theCathars were besieged at Montsegur; they held out for ten months; when theyfinally surrendered, two hundred who refused to renounce their faith were burntalive in one huge pyre.All this is necessary to understand Arthur Guirdham's book—and Arthur Guirdham.For he reached the conclusion that his obsessive interest in Catharism, and inthe Montsegur area, was due to the fact that he had been a Cathar 'priest' namedRoger de Grisolles during this final period of persecution.He reached this conclusion in a rather odd way. Throughout his life, he had hadnightmares in which he was asleep in a room when a tall man approached him;sometimes he would wake up screaming. In March 1962, he saw a patient who hadbeen suffering from a very similar nightmare: Mrs Smith. Her shrieks were soloud that her husband was afraid she would wake up the street. The doctor whohad referred her to Arthur Guirdham had at one time wondered if she wasepileptic. In fact, Mrs Smith's nightmares ceased when she met Guirdham. (Hisnightmares ceased at roughly the same time.) She didn't tell him this, for shewanted to continue as his patent—for a rather odd reason. She had recognized himas a man she knew well from her dreams.Mrs Smith hesitated for some time before she finally told Guirdham her fullstory. What emerged, finally, was this. As a child she had possessed aremarkable memory; during an exam she was able to write out page after page ofWordsworth, so that she was accused of cheating. At the age of eleven she becameunconscious with a severe headache; when she woke up, she had a degree of secondsight; she knew when her father would die; she knew that a friend's marriagewould not take place; she knew what was in letters before opening them. Duringher teens, she had three more attacks of unconsciousness—which were diagnosed asepileptic fits; then she began to have the curious, detailed dreams of herprevious life in the thirteenth century. She was a girl of humble background wholived with her family in a single-room house near Toulouse.One night, a man had arrived at the house, and asked for shelter. This was theCathar 'priest', Roger de Grisolles (or Roger-Isarn). The young girl—MrsSmith—fell in love with him. (Oddly enough, the dreams did not include her realname—Guirdham calls her Puerilia) She crept over to him in the night and kissedhis hand. The two became friendly. One day, her father beat her, and she lefthome and went to Roger's house, where she became his mistress. (Roger was not afully fledged priest, or a 'parfait'—Cathars who had foresworn sex.)Then, in Mrs Smith's dreams, there was a murder. A man came back from themurder, boasting about it; his name was Pierre de Mazerolles. Later, Roger wasarrested, and died in prison. Mrs Smith—or rather Puerilia—was burned at thestake. She also dreamed of this burning—in gruesome detail, with her blooddripping into the flames, and her eyelids burnt off.All kinds of names occurred in Mrs Smith's dreams. Now there are still recordsextant of the period—of the trials of Cathars, and so on. So Arthur Guirdham'stask was to study the records, and see if Mrs Smith's dreams made sense. Hequickly discovered that Pierre de Mazerolles was one of the men involved in themurder of the two Inquisitors. He was able to identify Roger, and his parentsand other members of the family. Mrs Smith's story definitely held together. Notonly that, but her notes, written so many years earlier, contained materialabout the Cathars that was not known to scholars at the time, and has only sincethen been confirmed.Altogether, I found The Cathars and Reincarnation a puzzling, difficult book.Not long after buying it, I realized that I had a couple more books by ArthurGuirdham on my shelves: A Theory of Disease and The Nature of Healing. I hadbought them at the time I had been writing my study of Rasputin and the fall ofthe Romanovs—I had asked Professor Wilson Knight's advice on books aboutthaumaturgic healing, and he had recommended these and a couple by HarryEdwards. At the time, they had failed to strike a chord, and I had forgotten Ihad them. Now I opened A Theory of Disease (1957) again, I recalled what haddissatisfied me at the time I read it. It holds the rather unusual thesis thatdisease is often due to the degree to which a person is preoccupied with his ownpersonality. Shaw's Saint Joan remarks, 'Thinking about yourself is likethinking about your stomach—it's the quickest way to make yourself sick.' So Icould understand his basic thesis—the relation of disease to self-awareness. Atthe same time, according to this thesis, 'outsiders' ought to be far moresubject to disease than most people. And while it is true that a large number ofartists and poets of the nineteenth century died of tuberculosis, I couldn't seeotherwise that outsiders are more disease prone than the average; on thecontrary, they're often less so. I thought of the occasion when Strindbergdetermined to commit suicide by getting pneumonia, so he flung himself into icywater, then climbed a tall tree, and crouched in the cold wind all night. In themorning, he staggered off and found a bed, expecting to wake up dying; insteadhe woke up feeling in the best of health.But now I re-read the book, I realized that this argument doesn't affect itsthesis. The whole point about 'outsiders' is that, in spite of feeling isolatedfrom society, and perhaps from life itself, they often possess remarkable depthsof toughness. Having got over that misunderstanding, I found A Theory of Diseasea remarkable book. (I still think it is in many ways his best.) When it came outin 1957, it must have been regarded as extremely unorthodox, even though manypsychologists recognized the mental origin of many physical diseases. But therewas a tendency to blame disease on sexual repressions. Now Guirdham makes thecontroversial statement that apart from the 'personality', withitsself-obsession, there is a layer of our being that could be called 'the Youthat is Not You'. (I had once expressed this by saying that man possesses apersonality, which is oriented towards self-satisfaction, and an impersonality,which can get a pure and impersonal delight out of mathematics or a sunset.)Health may depend on contact with this layer. The mentally ill patient oftensays: 'I cannot get away from myself. I think only of myself 'It would bebetter... if the doctor were able to instruct the patient in some meditative andspiritual technique whereby he could limit the operations of his personality bymerging himself with the absolute... Modern medicine had its beginnings in theGreek temples. It may have to return to the temple for its salvation... ' Butwhat makes the book so fascinating is the author's analysis of 'various types ofdiseases', and of the way these relate to various levels of the personality.Most books that relate healing to the 'spiritual' are rather airy-fairy andunrealistic; Guirdham's book has a strong flavor of reality.The Nature of Healing, published seven years after A Theory of Disease, goes agreat deal further—which is obviously why Wilson Knight had recommended it tome. He is concerned with the gift of healing, such as was possessed by Rasputin;you might say that he is in the field of Christian Science. He has obviouslyreached a watershed, and I could easily trace the route by which he arrived atit. Everybody must have noticed the way that certain people are totallypreoccupied with themselves, in a feverish, unhealthy way, and that such peopleseem unable to draw upon their full powers; they seem to be cut off from theirinner resources; whereas people who exude calm and serenity—and health—are oftencuriously un-egoistic. In fact, they often possess the power to heal. (Think ofMatthew Arnold's line about Wordsworth's healing power—connected with hisawareness of 'unknown modes of being', of things outside himself.) In A Theoryof Disease, Guirdham is preoccupied with working out the implications of theseobservations. In The Nature of Healing, he goes on to consider the way thatnegro 'medicine men' can cause death by laying a curse on someone, and howaborigines may wilt away and die because someone has 'pointed the bone' at them.Any psychologist would accept this, and would say that it is purelypsychological. But if this is so, then how far is all disease purelypsychological? And if we accept that purely psychological forces are involved indisease, can we discount the possibility of such forces being 'projected' by amedicine man in order to cause disease? Is it not possible that such forces areas real, if as invisible, as germs?In The Nature of Healing, Guirdham also touches on reincarnation; describing anurse with unusual healing powers, he comments that she knew the layout ofHampton Court long before she went there, so that visiting it was like goinghome; she was convinced that she had had some intense experience of happiness inthe garden at Hampton Court in 1660. 'She knew the London of Charles the Secondbetter than that of today,' and as a child, she made drawings of Normanarchitecture, with the same odd sense of familiarity. Guirdham ads: 'I amconvinced that the power of healing which she undoubtedly possessed involves thecapacity to disperse oneself through time.'These two books made it clear to me that Guirdham was not a crank—or perhapsjust given to wishful thinking. There is a feeling of clarity, balance,fair-mindedness, about them. He had obviously come a long way, and come veryslowly; he mentions that in the past he had been completely skeptical about thepossibility of 'healing' except by purely physical (or natural) forces.At aboutthe time I was reading these books, an old friend, Tom Greenwell, came to staywith us; he works on the Yorkshire Post, and he brought with him a pamphletcalled Catharism: The Mediaeval Resurgence of Primitive Christianity, by ArthurGuirdham. This, I felt, was beginning to look more like synchronicity thancoincidence. The Cathars and Reincarnation begins by describing how Guirdhamkept stumbling upon references to Catharism all over the place. One day, he wasdiscussing a village, and tried to recall the name of its pub; later the sameday, he took a book on the Pyrenees out of the public library—and came acrossthe name of the village and its pub in it. I felt that the pamphlet on theCathars—and the fact that Tom Greenwell had met Guirdham at the time when he wascontributing medical articles to the Yorkshire Post—dearly indicated that Iought to write to him. I did so, saying how much I had enjoyed the book, butthat I felt he had deliberately thrown away the possibility of a best-seller. Afew days later, I got a friendly letter back, in which he said that he haddeliberately played down the sensational elements—which is what I had suspected.I wrote a section about him in The Occult, as well as an article for the backpage of Man, Myth and Magic. By that time, we had finally met. In the spring of1971, he drove down to the west country to visit relatives, and came to stayovernight. The final paragraph of my article on him read: 'Earlier this year, hecame down to stay with us. My mental picture of him had varied between the imageof a keen-eyed psychiatrist, and of an absent-minded mystic. He was neither ofthese things: a gentle, intelligent man with the natural kindness that all gooddoctors have. Throughout the first evening, while we talked mostly aboutpsychology, I felt that there was an element about him that I could not place.Later on, it came to me: there was something priestly about him, something akinto Father Brown, or one of those mediaeval priors described by Rabelais.'This, I think, is a fairly good description. He is white haired, rather squarelybuilt—he points out in the healing book that many healers are—with a calm,rather soothing voice. He reminded me of another old medical friend, KennethWalker, who had been a pupil of Gurdjieff s. He had his wife Mary with him, andshe struck me as an ideal sort of person for a doctor's wife: calm, goodtempered, practical and thoroughly efficient. She and Joy seemed to have acertain amount in common; writers, like doctors, tend to become objects offixation for people who imagine they hold the solution to all their problems.Their wives have to learn to put up with this, and to adopt a philosophicalattitude, particularly to female admirers; you can read in their eyes a kind ofmild, patient irony. In a way, Mary Guirdham convinced me more than her husbandthat Arthur Guirdham wasn't over-credulous or over-inventive. She struck me asso balanced and intelligent that I couldn't believe she would aid and abet anykind of self-deception.We talked, as I have said, mainly about psychology. I was writing New Pathwaysin Psychology, and I was struck by the similarity of Maslow's views and ArthurGuirdham's. Translated into Maslow's language, you could say that ArthurGuirdham believed that disease was due to blockage of creative energies—that is,blockage of self-actualization. But then, in a way, Guirdham went further thanMaslow. When Maslow died, he was looking into this question of the varieties ofself-actualization—what Robert Leftwich might call the structure of thesuperconscious. Maslow was concerned only with learning to express creativeenergy: i.e. to evolve. Arthur Guirdham seemed to be implying that evolution ofconsciousness may involve us in the realm of 'strange powers'. All the same, itwas not the 'strange powers' we talked about that evening, but the psychotherapyof men like Maslow and Viktor Frankl. I was particularly fascinated by a storytold by Robert Ardrey about two scientists, Rubinstein and Best, who haddiscovered that planarion worms are subject to boredom and 'life failure' ifmade to repeat a task over and over again. But by making the task so difficultthat the worms have to make an enormous effort to learn it, they were able tomake the worms repeat it hundreds of times without boredom. Somehow, the wormscame to attach meaning to the task when they had to really summon their vitalityto learn it, and this meaning stayed permanently, un-eroded by repetition.Clearly, the question of disease and health is closely connected with thequestion of meaning and boredom. Disease is basically the outcome oflife-failure.Arthur disclaimed any healing powers of his own, and any 'psychic' ability. Hewas, he said, just a catalyst, the sort of person who seems to bring out'strange powers' in other people. But he certainly possesses a degree ofnatural, if not supernatural, healing power. I had developed a rather odd painat the back of my skull. There was a slight ache in the muscles of the rightrear-side of my neck, and a sharp pain at the back of the head in moments ofexcitement, such as sexual orgasm. Arthur stood behind my chair, and gentlymassaged the muscles of the neck and shoulders for a few minutes; after this,the stiffness vanished, and stayed away for about a week. There was a definitelysoothing feeling as he pressed the muscles.My ten-year-old daughter took an immediate and warm liking to him—so much sothat she asked him if he would mind being her godfather. She'd been looking outfor a godfather for some time, ever since we'd called on the godfather of herbrother Damon—the Blake scholar Foster Damon—at Annisquam, Mass. Arthur seemedagreeable; he is now Sally's godfather...The only other thing I recollect about his two-day visit is that he talked agreat deal about the south of France, and places he'd visited; he also producedsome bottles of an odd sweet champagne from the Languedoc. I don't particularlylike travel, and traveler's tales usually bore me; but there was something abouthis description of small French villages in the Midi—the heat and the lazinessand the local wines—that fascinated me. It was obvious that he loved thearea—that, in a way, he was obsessed by it.Later in the year, I visited the Guirdhams at their home near Bath—we weredriving back from the north of England. We were only staying overnight, so therewasn't time for a great deal of talk; but he told me that he was working on aneven more remarkable story than that of Mrs Smith—a record of a whole group ofreincarnations. He let me see some of the manuscript. As I read the first page,I began to feel—no, not excited; that would be the wrong word; a kind ofsatisfaction, as when something turns out very much to your liking. Thismanuscript—which I have with me now as I write—was clearer and morestraightforward than the earlier book on reincarnation. And it raised andanswered most of the questions—and doubts—that had occurred to me as I read theearlier book. He says on the first page:'I am naturally of a skeptical and cautious nature, and am known in my family asDoubting Thomas. I am astonished that the phenomena I have encountered have beenrevealed to me of all people. I have occupied myself in discovering thesignificance of names and messages produced in dreams, visions, in states ofclairaudience and dictated by discarnate entities. Because of the unusual originof my data I have to stress all the more carefully that I was for forty years arun-of-the-mill psychiatrist. In the National Health Service I was the SeniorConsultant in my clinical area. I hold a scientific degree, as well as being adoctor of medicine. It is all the more necessary to make these points since Iclaim that this, my own story, is, of its kind, the most remarkable I haveencountered.'And in the first chapter, he makes an observation that aroused my interest: thatmost of the cases of reincarnation he has come across were rather healthy,active people with 'more than average energy'; not, as you might expect, 'sicksensitives'. This is certainly what I would have predicted, on the basis of thepsychology I have developed in New Pathways. Knowledge of previous existences iscertainly not necessary to our everyday survival; all we need is a narrow,commonplace consciousness. Flashes of this kind of knowledge would only come,like 'peak experiences', to very healthy people, with energy to spare.I was also intrigued by something he says about Miss Mills, an acquaintance whoasked him one day whether the words 'Raymond' and 'Albigensians' meant anythingto him. (They kept recurring in her head.) Miss Mills mentioned childhooddreams—following an illness—of running away from a castle, and of being ledtowards a stake with heaped faggots. She commented that, as a child, the rest ofthe family had enjoyed the spectacle of a building on fire, while she had beenhysterical. I recall similar feelings in my own childhood. There was a weeklyserial on at the local cinema, with a character called the Eagle—a Lone Rangertype who always found himself in some dangerous situation at the end of everyepisode. But one day, he was trapped in a burning church; and I was so horrifiedthat I couldn't bear to ever watch him again. Not long after The Occult cameout, a friend asked me if he could bring someone along to meet me, a woman whoran a nursing home in Cornwall, and who was interested in occult matters. Wespent an interesting evening talking about all kinds of things; but at onepoint, she suddenly told me that she was certain I had been a monk in a previousexistence, and had been burned to death...In many respects, Arthur Guirdham's account of his experiences with Miss Millsparallels that of his experiences with Mrs Smith. Miss Mills would wake up inthe night with names in her head—names like Montserver, Braida, Cisilia; thesehe was able to identify, through his knowledge of the siege of Montsegur and theburning of the heretics two days after its surrender. After a while, she wouldfind notes written on a notepad she kept by her bed, scrawled in a handresembling her own. One said: 'Raymond de Perella. Sun—No. Treasure—No.Books—Yes.' Arthur Guirdham interpreted this as a reference to questions aboutMontsegur. It had been suggested that Montsegur had been the site of asun-worship temple; Miss Mills's 'instructor' was apparently denying this. As tothe treasure of Montsegur, this is another question debated by historians. Four'parfaits' (the highest Cathar grade) were lowered from the walls of the citadeljust before its surrender, carrying unspecified 'treasure'. It has beensuggested that this was money, or even the Holy Grail. Miss Mills's instructorwas asserting that the 'treasure' consisted of Cathar sacred books.In his eighth chapter, Guirdham has an interesting and important discussion of abasic doctrinal point: reincarnation. He comments that many of the biblicalquotations dictated to Miss Mills were from St Paul—which, he says, is naturalenough, since St Paul is the 'supreme interpreter of Christianity from theoccult point of view'—an observation that had certainly never occurred to me.Paul lays emphasis on the difference between the corporeal body and thespiritual body. Guirdham says: 'His outlook tied up directly with modernconceptions of etheric and astral bodies and the like. Orthodox Christians mayjib at the idea that early Christianity was characterized by psychiccommunication and spiritist phenomena. What was to be revealed later to MissMills indicated clearly that primitive Christianity was of this nature.' He goeson to state that the verse from Corinthians I (Chapter 15, verse 45) '... thefirst Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit'is specifically Cathar, although orthodox Christians tend to accept it withoutreally asking what it means. 'This particular verse implies that a living soulis in man from the Beginning... Man is born with his full psychic complement.This is an essential feature of the doctrine of reincarnation. After death, thepsyche does not pass into any such state of cosmic somnolence as is representedby limbo. It embarks on a process of reincarnation. 'The last Adam was made aquickening spirit' refers to our ultimate development in being emancipated frommatter. To the Cathars, this was the raison d'etre of our existence. Theyrecognized that there was every gradation between matter conceived of as inertspirit, and, at the other extreme, as so spiritualized that Christ could appearon earth and reveal the true nature of his spiritualized body to the disciplesat the Transfiguration.'But I must move on to the central point of this strange book. The adjective'strange' is an understatement. It is either a piece of sheer nuttiness, or oneof the most important books ever written. For its central assertion is that awhole group of Cathars from Montsegur have been reincarnated in England in thetwentieth century. Miss Mills was only the first. And although she began byhaving to ask Guirdham whether Raymond and Albigensian meant anything to him,she ended by actually seeing Braida de Montserver, a 'Parfaite' (i.e. a kind offemale priest) who was burned; Braida began to pay her nightly visits, andinstruct her in the history, philosophy and healing techniques of Catharism.Later, she was visited by two male Cathars, Guilhabert de Gastres, and a bishop,Bertrand de Marty. And here, we might say, the plot thickens. Miss Mills becameconvinced that Bertrand de Marty was her father—that is to say, that her owntwentieth-century father had been a reincarnation of Marty.In October 1971, Miss Mills was contacted by a friend from the Midlands, whomGuirdham calls simply 'Betty'. Betty's husband had died of a heart attack, andshe was badly shaken. She decided to take a holiday abroad—in the Pyrenees.Guirdham was asked to supply names of places worth visiting, Inevitably, manywere associated with Catharism. Betty went to the Pyrenees, and apparently foundthe experience profoundly satisfying. And on her return to England, she began tomention names of thirteenth-century Cathars that soon convinced Miss Mills thathere was yet another character from Montsegur, reincarnated in twentieth-centuryEngland. Unfortunately, before this exciting new development could be studied,Betty died of a stroke. Her mother, Jane, began sorting through her papers, andfound references to various names—Braida, Isarn, and so on. She also discovereddrawings made by Betty as a child—during a serious illness at the age of seven.These drawings, mostly of a crude, matchstick variety, contain references topeople present at the siege of Montsegur, and are full of Cathar references.They seemed to trigger off some reaction—or buried memory—in Jane, who nowherself began 'recalling' her own life in the thirteenth century in snatches.Another person enters the story—an old schoolfriend of Miss Mills namedKathleen. She enquired after Betty—whom she had also known—and on being told shewas dead,described a dream in which she had seen Betty in a wood with a mandressed in dark blue with a chain around his waist... This man was actuallyGuirdham's earlier incarnation, Roger Isarn; Guirdham goes into the evidence forthis with his usual scholarly precision. It becomes clear that Kathleen isanother of the group of reincarnated .And there are still 'more to come. There is Penelope, who had been a businessassociate of Miss Mills' some years ago. One evening, Penelope diedunexpectedly, a hundred miles from Bath; Miss Mills, who was with Guirdham atthe time, had a sudden powerful premonition that 'something is happening tosomebody'. Penelope's husband Jack said that the last word she spoke was'Brasillac'—the name of a sergeant-at-arms who fought at Montsegur, and had beenburned at the stake. Jack came to call on Miss Mills, describing his wife'sdreams of a castle on a hill, of men dressed in blue robes; he spoke of herhorror of fire, and of having stones thrown at her. (The castle was bombardedwith stones thrown by giant catapults.) After this, Jack himself began to havedreams of fighting in a castle on the hill, accompanied by names. Guirdhamfinally concluded that Jack was Brasillac, and that his wife Penelope had beenhis sweetheart in his thirteenth-century existence...At the end of the book, Guirdham mentions that Miss Mills continues to practise'healing', under Braida's direction, and he concludes:'To me, as a doctor, there is something of specific importance transmitted byBraida's messages. Dualism is an important antidote to the materialism ofmedicine. The next step in our evolution as doctors is to recognize more theinfluence of the psyche imprisoned in matter. Its recollections of experiencesin past lives are related to present symptoms. The recognition of two basicenergies of good and evil is vital to any cosmic concept of medicine. Healing isa particular expression of the emanation of goodness. On the other hand, it isindisputable that many disease symptoms and syndromes are attributable to thepower of evil. Discussing such factors is beyond the scope of this book. All onecan say here is that Braida's messages enlarged enormously one's medicalhorizons.'Obviously, this book—entitled We Are One Another—answers the basic objectionsthat can be made to Cathars and Reincarnation. It is possible to accept that apatient should have detailed memories of a previous existence in the thirteenthcentury; but much more difficult to believe that the doctor himself is areincarnation of a man with whom the patient was involved seven hundred yearsago. It also presents a problem for the total skeptic, who is inclined todismiss the whole thing as self-delusion or downright lies. Arthur Guirdham isan intelligent man; this was plain to me from his books, before I met him; if heis inventing the whole thing, why should he go out of-his way to make his storyunbelievable? We Are One Another reveals that the Puerilia-Roger relation isjust part of a much larger pattern; it would seem that dozens of the Cathars ofMontsegur have been reincarnated in the twentieth century for a specificpurpose. The purpose, presumably, is to prove the reality of reincarnation.Let us agree that both explanations—the skeptical and the non-skeptical—fit thefacts as presented in these two books. A News of the World reporter—the kind whopublishes investigations of mediums, healers and astrologers—would have nodifficulty explaining what has happened. Guirdham has always been an unorthodoxdoctor, with tendencies to occultism. He becomes interested in the Cathars andCatharism. And when Mrs Smith talks to him about her own thirteenth-centuryincarnations, he is willing to believe that he was her lover. In fact, ofcourse, all that has happened is that a patient has become fixated on herdoctor, and looks around for ways to gain his interest... Miss Mills is also,significantly, an unmarried lady. She gets drawn into the fantasy, and she drawsothers into it, until a whole group of her friends are convinced that they werethirteenth-century Cathars. An interesting case of group hysteria or groupsuggestibility...Now Guirdham is fully aware of these objections, and he takes a great deal oftrouble in both books to emphasize that the complex facts cannot be accountedfor by suggestibility or even by telepathy. Mrs Smith's notes about the Catharsdate back to her childhood, and various historical details—which she mentionedin the notes—were not even known to scholars at the time. A great deal of spacein both these books is taken up with the examination of such details, whichmakes them, in some ways, rather tedious for the ordinary lay reader. If oneaccepts the genuineness of Betty's notes and drawings in the second book, thenit is quite impossible that she could have been drawn into the fantasy by MissMills.In fact, the only skeptical hypothesis that can be regarded as unassailable isthat Guirdham himself has invented the whole thing: that neither Mrs Smith, MissMills, Betty, Jane and the rest ever existed. And on my own knowledge of theGuirdhams, I find this almost impossible to accept. For what it is worth—and Iagree it would not convince the News of the World reporter—he strikes me aseminently sane, balanced and honest.Miss Mills told Guirdham that it was important to go ahead with the publicationof the facts about this strange case, because the same kind of thing ishappening all over the world at the moment, and it is important that otherpeople involved should realize that they are not the only ones. In which case,it could be argued that it is in Guirdham's interests—and those of the'Cathars'—to try to furnish some solid proofs. He mentions several times thatMiss Mills had been unwilling to discuss her own experiences, even when some ofthe others involved—Betty, Jane, Jack—offered evidence that suggested that theythemselves were Cathars. On the other hand, Miss Mills is obviously the key tothe problem. At a fairly early stage in their acquaintance, she experienced apain in her hip, and when Guirdham examined her, he found that she had a strangeline of blisters across her back—hard blisters. This, said Miss Mills, was whereshe had been struck across the back with a burning torch as she was led to thestake. The blisters would certainly be very powerful corroborative evidence forthe story.However, let me, for the moment, put aside the doubts and qualifications, andask the vital question: If this is all true, what does it mean?Centrally, it would establish the fact of reincarnation, as certainly asNewton's observations established the fact of gravity. Which, even in occultcircles, would cause a sensation. For, as I have already commented, by no meansall spiritualists accept reincarnation—in fact, very few of them do. Mrs Beattieseems inclined to deny it completely. On the other hand, there is a great dealof solid evidence for something of the sort. In The Occult, I quote Twenty CasesSuggestive of Reincarnation by Ian Stevenson MD, published by the AmericanSociety for Psychical Research in 1966. This is one of those typically careful,painstaking volumes that offers huge quantities of detailed information aboutcases of supposed reincarnation. In a typical case, an Indian girl of sevendescribed to her parents her previous existence in a nearby town, which she hadnever visited. She said that she had been a mother, and had died in childbirth.Taken to the town in question, she was able to point out people and places in away that demonstrated that she certainly had a thorough knowledge of them, and,as able to talk to relatives of her previous 'self in the local dialect,although she had only been taught Hindustani. In the case of a Hindu boy who hadbeen beheaded at the age of six by a relative who wanted to inherit propertythat would descend to the child, the 'reincarnated' boy had a scar on his neckresembling a knife wound. Another child who began to describe a previousexistence (at the age of two) had scars on his stomach resembling gunshotwounds; he claimed to have been killed (in his previous existence) by a gunblast in the abdomen. All this would seem to support Guirdham's statements abouthis reincarnated Cathars suffering the pains of their burning and developingblisters.Even if I did not know Arthur Guirdham, and consider him honest, I would stillbe inclined to give credit to his two Cathar books in the light of his otherwork. A Theory of Disease shows him, quite simply, breaking away from theFreudianism and behaviorism that form the foundation of every psychiatrist'smedical training. Like Jung and Rank, he is groping towards 'holistic' concepts.And the holistic trend has been steadily gaining force in science and philosophyever since Husserl formulated Phenomenology in 1912 and the gestaltpsychologists began their experiments in perception. Man, Divine or Social(1960) is a determined attempt to formulate a kind of metaphysics of 'holism'.He again starts from the recognition of the 'You that is Not You'—what Husserlwould call the transcendental ego. This book is about the conflict between man'stwo basic urges: what he calls 'the cosmic urge' and the Herd-PersonalityImpulse. This is less 'metaphysical' than it sounds. Wordsworth's poem 'Theworld is too much with us' deals with the same problem. (So does my Outsider.}Observed purely objectively—phenomenologically—man is a dual being, torn between'the triviality of everydayness' (to use Heidegger's phrase) and sudden flashesof deeper meanings, 'a certain odor on the wind'. The problem is 'close-upness',being forced to live with our noses pressed against reality. His use of the term'Herd-Personality Impulse' indicates that he is preoccupied with the 'outsider'problem and how to solve it.One of his most revealing books is a short work—a mere ninety-fivepages—published in 1966 under the pseudonym Francis Eaglesfield; it is calledSilent Union, A Record of Unwilled Communication, and consists of extracts fromhis journals about patients who had 'occult faculties'. For example, arugger-playing coal merchant, who had often dreamed of things before theyhappened. When he followed the beagles, this man never had to look in thenewspaper to see what time the hunt would start; he seemed to know intuitively,and would set out at the right time. This book forms a link between the earlyhealing books and the later 'occult' books. Many of its cases are simply 'odd'.For example, the rather repressed, silent man who blamed himself for the deathof his seven-year-old-son—he had failed to call the doctor soon enough. His sonhad had a wart on his forehead, and the father often felt it with his indexfinger as he stroked the boy's forehead. One day, ten years after the boy'sdeath, the father developed a wart on the fingertip; then they spread across thehand. A doctor burned off one wart with caustic; after this, the man called onan amateur wart charmer, who made the others 'disappear' very quickly. Theincident demonstrates that warts may be cured, as well as caused, bypsychological strain.But the most interesting and significant section of the book is its longestchapter. He begins by describing an odd occurrence when he was on holiday inYorkshire with Mary. They were staying at a hotel, and had been to visit afriend at a town fifteen miles away. They had only been driving home about fourminutes when they passed a signpost saying that their destination was only threemiles away. This seemed impossible; they stopped and looked in the AA book—whichconfirmed that the towns were fifteen miles apart. A few minutes later, theyfound themselves driving into the town—even the last three miles had 'vanished',or been foreshortened. Time had somehow accelerated.He goes on to describe the hotel they were staying in: 'there was somethingfascinating and macabre in its perfection of mediocrity'. Yet one evening,looking up from his book in the lounge, everyone seemed to be intensely alive,'and endowed suddenly with a new and inexplicable dignity'. It was after thesetwo events that he began to keep a diary, the diary he quotes in this book.The events seem, in a way, trivial. But they are of considerable significance.The first indicates the illusory and relative nature of time; the second, therelative nature of our perception of the external world. Nothing could seem'realer' than the dullness of a lot of ordinary middle-class people, apparentlyincapable of an original thought—or any thought at all. Something happens in thebrain, a kind of psychic orgasm, and they are transfigured. It is as if a new'eye' had opened in the brain.He goes on to recount two more odd events. One we already know about. In acouple of pages, without any details about Cathars (or his own involvement) herecounts the story of Mrs Smith, calling her D; he mentions simply that herdetailed account of a previous existence convinced him of reincarnation. He alsomentions an old friend, Celia, in whose presence he has always felt refreshed,'as if I had been charged by an inexhaustible battery'. But Celia had a deepdistrust of anything 'psychic', and disliked Mrs Smith's influence (such as itwas). On a walk with Celia one day, Guirdham felt completely low and exhausted,as if recovering from a serious illness, and felt like this for several days. Heconcluded that Celia had, in some way, withdrawn her psychic energy. Again, aminor event—pointing only to the mind's power to give strength and to heal.There is another brief and interesting episode. His wife asked him what hethought Keats looked like; and then, a few minutes later, what was the next lineafter 'Fear no more the heat of the sun' from Cymbeline. Ten minutes later, in abook on Napoleon, she came across a reference to Keats, and the song inCymbeline.And why should these disparate episodes be grouped together? Because, I think,they all point to the same thing: a 'bridge period' in life in which somefundamental change occurs. As far as I know, no one has ever written about theimportance of 'bridge periods'. During these periods, you sense that somethingis happening, some basic change, of the sort that occurs at puberty. But then,when the body changes at puberty, you are aware that this is a purely subjectivechange; it is happening to you, not to the rest of the world. But in other'bridge periods', there is a curious feeling that can only be described as'involvement', as if you are involved in some wider, more general change. It isthe kind of 'sense of change' you might experience if you drove down from NewYork to Florida in midwinter, and saw the scenery becoming greener, and felt theair becoming warmer. I am not implying that 'the World' is somehow takingaccount of you; only that you seem to have passed into a region where you aresubject to slightly different laws. New experiences seem to be thrustingthemselves under your nose. These periods are so important because we accept astatic existence; the heroes of Chekhov and Beckett seem to be saying: 'Thingsdon't change. Things can't change. Life just goes on repeating itself, like agramophone stuck in a groove, and we just get older and die... ' But any youngman who has just discovered poetry or music or science knows this is untrue. Theuniverse is endlessly new and fresh. And if we find it difficult to be endlesslynew and fresh, this is because of some absurd misunderstanding, some piece ofignorance—for example, like a man who took a bath every morning in the samedirty water, unaware that the plug is for emptying the bath and the taps forrefilling it with clean water...Being static has its uses. There are periods when the mind needs to be closed tooutside influences. When I read Freud or Bertrand Russell, I realize that theirpositive qualities depend on their rather narrow pragmatic attitudes. You cannotbake a cake with the oven door open. Too much open-mindedness makes formediocrity. We know this instinctively; this is why we accept a certainnarrowness of consciousness without too much protest. All the same, it is anexciting moment when mental barriers seem to be withdrawn; the shutters open;light comes in. A chrysalis must feel rather the same as it changes into abutterfly. In such states, you tend to feel sorry for Chekhov and Beckett, andalso rather contemptuous; their gloom is largely their own fault.Arthur Guirdham went into his 'bridge period' comparatively late in life. Hespecifies the period as his late forties, when he began relaxation exercises.These sometimes produced a sense of being detached from his body or looking downon himself from near the ceiling; but he is careful to state that it was only a'sense'—not a full-fledged experience. Then there were the cases ofclairvoyance, telepathy and healing that he mentions in Silent Union. 'SometimesI acquired the symptoms, often physical, of patients who began to recover at thesame time that I had assumed their symptoms. During these periods I experiencedall manner of so-called coincidences. People I had never seen for years camevividly to my mind. In a few minutes I would meet them in the street. I wouldpuzzle my mind with abstruse problems. The answers would be prodded by strangersI had met in casual encounters. I obtained from these experiences an utterconviction of the indivisibility of human consciousness. I discovered that inthe sphere of medicine we share a common psychic life and exchange, with thoseon the same wavelength, not only thoughts and feelings, but the syndromes ofdisease.' The ground was being prepared for the insights into Catharism.The interesting thing is that he was not entirely unprepared; in childhood, andagain in early manhood, there had been 'glimpses'. At the age of four, he had aserious illness, and had a dream of heaven—a dream of such intensity that he nowbelieves it to have been a real experience of 'the other world'. He was in afield with a little girl, but the colors had an extraordinary intensity. In histeens, he had experiences of premonitions, none of them important, of thingsthat he would later see in the newspapers; this sounds like the 'timeexperiences' described by J. W. Dunne. There was also a curious episode in histhird year at Oxford. Staying a night at an inn at Beckley, on the edge ofOtmoor, he began to shiver violently. A doctor diagnosed a liver complaint. Fortwo days he felt cold and jaundiced, then recovered. Later on, he discoveredthat Otmoor was one of the last places in England where malaria occurred, and itstruck him that he had experienced all the symptoms of malaria, without actuallyhaving the disease. It seems to have been a case of picking up the psychicvibrations.All these speculations about the origins of disease are gathered together andexplored in a book called Obsession (1972). Here he suggests openly thatchildren's 'night terrors' may not be due to nightmares, but to genuine forcesof evil. In an autobiographical book, A Foot in Both Worlds (recentlypublished), he describes one of his own 'night terrors' at the age of six—whatseemed to be an encounter with the Devil. In Obsession, he is concerned with'compulsives'. One child patient suffered from convulsions, asthma and nightterrors. He was also incredibly, rigidly punctual. He had a recurring dream inwhich he was gasping with thirst in a desert. He was an omnivorous reader, butnever read fiction; he preferred books on Roman history, and on travels inAmerica and Australia—both countries with large tracts of desert, as Guirdhampoints out. He does not reach any positive conclusions about the patient, butanyone who has read his other books can see the direction of his thoughts: thatthe deep interest in Roman history could indicate reincarnation, and that thegasping for breath and the dreams of dying of thirst in the desert could stemfrom an experience in a previous existence. As to the obsessive punctuality, itis the attempt to escape fears 'outside time' by plunging into time—trying tograsp it, so to speak.He also mentions some cases—which he described to me personally—of houses thatproduce mental illness; when the patient moves, he tends to recover. He told meof a street in Bath in which thirteen out of forty houses have produced mentalillness in patients. Here, obviously, we are back to the L-fields and T-fieldsdiscussed earlier in this book.Why am I discussing Arthur Guirdham at such length, when he himself says he isnot particularly 'psychic'—only a 'catalyst'? Because I think I can enter intohis mind more fully than into those of Robert Leftwich or Mrs Beattie. For thefirst fifty years of his life, he was apparently non-psychic. If I had met himtwenty years ago, I very much doubt whether I would have predicted that he mightbecome so involved in psychic matters. Why? Because—and here I must treadcarefully—I am inclined to believe that 'psychic' activities are often an outletfor energies that could find a more normal creative release. Is it entirelycoincidence that Crowley was not a very good poet or novelist? Or that so manypeople on the fringe of 'occultism' have a highly developed desire for attentionand recognition? On the other hand, Guirdham was a successful medical man,senior consultant for his area, medical correspondent for a major newspaper.Moreover, he is a naturally good writer. When he sent me his novel The Gibbetand the Cross, I expected it to be a typical 'amateur novel', even, though hisother books are well written; fiction and non-fiction call for entirelydifferent talents. I was surprised and impressed by the tight, clean prose, theeconomy, the sense of knowing exactly where he is going. Crowley's novels revealhis mind: sloppy, self-indulgent, undisciplined. Before a man has learned how tomake use of his powers, he's always a bit of a confidence trickster; you cansmell it in his work. Guirdham has the economy of a man who has learned thetrick of creation. You feel you are in the hands of an honest and single-mindedman.So whether or not he himself possesses 'strange powers', the issues he raisesare perhaps the most important in this volume. One of the chief drawbacks tomost manifestations of 'the occult'—whether in witchcraft, astral projection,communication with the dead—is that they are ultimately ambiguous. If the'spirits' really wanted to convince us of their existence, they could make a farbetter job of it. Apart from a few really gifted mediums—like Daniel DunglasHome—or 'magicians', like Gurdjieff, most 'psychics' raise more doubts than theyallay. Name almost any important figure of 'occultism', from Cornelius Agrippato Madame Blavatsky, and the suggestions of genuine powers and of charlatanismjust about balance one another out.Now Arthur Guirdham, a man whom no one has so far accused of charlatanism, hasmade claims that seem to be as startling and far reaching as those in Einstein'soriginal paper on relativity. His first book on reincarnation could be dismissedby the skeptic as a piece of gullibility; Mrs Smith happened to engage hisintellectual interest with her revelations about Catharism, and he allowed herto convince him that she and he had been associated in the thirteenth century...The second book is not open to this interpretation. It states that half a dozenpeople, already in loose contact, independently reached the conclusion that theybelonged to the Montsegur Cathars. The evidence presented is too detailed to bedismissed as self-deception. This is either deliberate, carefully planneddeception, or it is an important breakthrough in our knowledge of the universe.If Guirdham is right, then the psychic laws governing human existence are morecomplex than Darwin or Mendel ever suspected, and the inter-relations betweenhuman beings are deeper than Freud ever suspected.And what do I personally think? My own natural skepticism leads me to wonder ifthere are not other possible explanations. I must confess that I am basicallydubious about Guirdham's dualism. All my life I have been naturally andinstinctively a Platonist. That is to say, I have never been able to accept theidea of evil as an independent force; rather, as the outcome of muddle andstupidity. If a moth flies into a candle flame, no evil is involved; no doubt atthe next stage in their evolution, moths will learn to develop a sensitivity toheat that will save them from getting singed. A human being who 'commits evil'is one who, for reasons of frustration and impatience, prefers to increase themuddle and chaos in the universe. I do not mind using the word 'evil' about aman who takes pleasure in inflicting pain, for I believe in the existence offree will and of choice; but it still seems to me that he is doing evil out of akind of inner-muddle. All high-dominance people are possessed by the urge to dosomething, and if they can see no way to create, then they may destroy out of akind of childish anger with the universe. It seems to me quite possible—indeed,very probable—that the psychic forces of evil unleashed by human beings maypersist after their death, so that a house in which someone has been thoroughlymiserable or died horribly may retain the imprint for years afterwards. I ameven prepared to admit that such 'forces' might behave like discarnate entities,continuing to try to destroy. But that is still a long way from accepting theCathar position of evil as a genuinely independent force. Moreover, fromGuirdham's books, I am not really clear whether he is a genuine dualist—that is,one who believes that the world of matter was created by the Devil.[1] TheChurch persecuted Manichees and other dualists because the Book of Genesisstates that God looked upon the world and saw that it was good; and the basicvision of the mystics has confirmed this. It asserts that the world is athousand times more beautiful than our senses tell us, and that our habit of'cutting out' 99 per cent of our experience—which has enabled us to evolve toour present stage—has also prevented us from realizing how entirely blessed itis to be alive. If I am honest with myself, I have to admit that I do not haveany sympathy for Catharism. The manner in which the Church stamped it out washorrible and wicked; but doctrinally, I suspect I am on the side of the Church.But then, it does not seem to me that the basic attitudes of Guirdham's books,from A Theory of Disease to We Are One Another and Obsession, are rounded on adualist point of view. On the contrary, the delight that emerges from hisdescriptions of nature make it dear that, emotionally anyway, he looks upon theworld and finds it good. His previous incarnation, Roger-Isarn, evidently feltthe same way, since he lived with 'Puerilia' as his mistress—although he laterbecame a Parfait, and presumably renounced sexual pleasure.At this point, I must squarely answer a question that must have occurred toevery reader with a logical turn of mind. In The Outsider, I quoted Sartre onthis matter of belief. If the telephone rang, and a voice on the other end said:'This is God speaking. Believe and you are saved; disbelieve and you aredamned,' a sensible human being would reply: 'All right, I'm damned.' Even theBible recommends us to prove everything, and hold fast to what is good.Now should I not, according to that formula, totally reject all the claims ofRobert Leftwich, Eunice Beattie and Arthur Guirdham—especially Guirdham, since,of the three, he offers least corroboration? Am I not flying in the face of abasic existentialist principle—in fact, a basic philosophical principle?This is a question that can only be answered in the manner Newman answeredCharles Kingsley's accusations of religious dishonesty: by trying to 'explainmyself.As a child, I accepted spiritualism. My grandmother was a spiritualist. Mymother accepted spiritualism, although she never, as far as I know, attended aspiritualist church. I personally have always had a natural distaste forchurches and people worshipping together; for some reason, it arouses in me thesame irritable rejection that Einstein always felt when he saw marchingsoldiers. The whole 'outsider' idea is profoundly ingrained in me (as, indeed,it is in Guirdham—hence his emphasis on the Herd-Personality Impulse). I feelthat, ideally, every human being ought to be strong enough to stand totallyalone; it is the only way to the realization of our profoundest capacities. Soalthough I accepted the notion of life after death, the whole idea of aspiritualist church was distasteful to me. But I read books like Harry Price'sSearch for Truth and Conan Doyle's Wanderings of a Spiritualist. I once evenattempted to read Swedenborg's True Christian Religion, but concluded he wasfeeble minded.My spiritualist phase lasted until I was ten or eleven; then I fell in love withscience. I use the phrase deliberately, because that is what it was: a loveaffair, an absorbing passion, a glimpse of salvation. The original impulse camefrom a book called The Marvels and Mysteries of Science, and a cheap chemistryset my mother bought me for Christmas when I was eleven. If Guirdham is rightabout reincarnation, I think I must have been a scientist in a previousexistence. I read Holmyard's School Chemistry from beginning to end like anovel, then went on to books like Eddington's Nature of the Physical Worm andJeans' Mysterious Universe. It was a marvelous feeling. Boredom was at an end.No more over-long school holidays in which I wondered what to do, no more hoursof listlessly re-reading tattered comics or wondering how I could raise themoney to go to the cinema. I had an interest that stayed with me from the time Iopened my eyes in the morning until I went to bed at night.The odd thing is that this passion for science, which led me to write asix-volume Manual of General Science at the age of thirteen, soon spread toother subjects. I read Toad's Guide to Philosophy and The Concise CambridgeHistory of English Literature and Robert O. Ballou's Bible of the World. A bookon ballet by Arnold Haskell convinced me for a time that I wanted to be adancer. By the age of sixteen, I felt that science was too narrow; I now readhistories of art and music with the same avidity that I had read Holmyard'sChemistry. But the interest in spiritualism and the occult had gone completelyinto abeyance. It was facts that interested me. Like Eliot, I felt strongly that'human kind cannot bear very much reality', that most people never escape beyondthe narrow horizon of the personal and the subjective. Spiritualism struck mesimply as wishful thinking, It was too personal—all tied up with people andtheir emotions and their desire to cling to the past. It seemed to me that theuniverse is bigger and colder and stranger, and that it doesn't care much aboutpeople or their emotions. The only way to evolve is to become more like theuniverse, to try to be less 'personal'.I became an obsessive. Not only because of this craving for every possible sortof knowledge, but because I was afraid I might spend the rest of my life workingat jobs I hated. This is something Arthur Guirdham and Robert Leftwich mightfind it difficult to conceive—although Mrs Beattie wouldn't: the feeling that itmay be as hard to escape into a more rewarding, more creative way of life as toescape from Sing Sing. I had no qualifications; when I left school, all I coulddo was to offer myself as unskilled labor, at the equivalent of ten new pence anhour. Becoming a writer offered the only chance of escape. So I ground away: atstories, at my novel, at essays on Shaw, Nijinsky, Hemingway...To become an obsessive is to develop a kind of armor, like a crab. The armorinsulates you and protects you. It also imprisons you. When you sunbathe on thebeach, you can take off your clothes, but not your armor. But then, a prison canalso be a useful place, if you have a lot of work you want to get done withoutinterruption...When an obsessional pattern is established, you get so used to living withinner-tension that you find it impossible to relax. I could only truly relax byinducing a state of wider consciousness through poetry or musk. I once satcross-legged at the top of a small mountain in the Lake District, trying to makemyself see Grasmere as Wordsworth saw it; but it didn't work; the relaxationwouldn't come. It felt like a kind of inner constipation.When The Outsider was a success, I knew I could make some kind of a living fromwriting. I moved to the country. But the relaxation still wouldn't come. Notimmediately, anyway. It only came very slowly, taking about five years. I mightbe looking out of a window as it rained; and suddenly the rain would seem to befalling into my mind. T. E. Lawrence described being taken through an Arabpalace; the walls of each room contained a different perfume, which his guideprofessed to be able to smell. Finally, the guide took him to a room with brokenwindows, through which the 'cold, eddyless wind of the desert' could blowfreely. He said: 'But this is the sweetest smell of all.' Lawrence understoodthis; but he died before he had learned to relax enough to experience it. But Inow began to experience it; there were odd moments when my windows opened, andthe wind blew in.I was thirty when Joy presented me with a daughter, and I discovered I couldwake her up by thinking about her in the middle of the night, or by looking outof the windows when she was asleep in her pram. And the first time I held her, Ihad a strong sense that she knew I was her father. Suddenly, I could understandwhat it would be like to be a fish, with nerves along your sides that registerthe pressure of the water, or the approach of an enemy. One day, fixed aftermowing the lawn, I was about to drop heavily on to the bed and pull off myshoes. Something made me look round; Sally was lying near the edge of the bed;my weight would probably have broken her ribs.My first child had been born when I was twenty, but there had been no telepathiclink; I was still in my carapace—as, I think, Arthur Guirdham's professionalduties obliged him to stay in his carapace until he came close to retirement.In the mid-sixties, I made one interesting and basic discovery: that an immenseeffort of will serves exactly the same purpose as total relaxation, and achievesit rather more efficiently. In 1966, on my way to America—and a twelve-weeklecture tour—I was feeling low and depressed. As the train passed a spot where,twelve years earlier, I had experienced a powerful surge of insight, I suddenlyfelt a kind of rage, a desire to grab my self-pity by the throat and choke it todeath. A furious effort of concentration for just about five minutes produced asense of strength and freedom, which lasted for most of the tour. But as soon assheer fatigue began to affect me, after ten weeks of non-stop flying andtalking, I became accident-prone; everything began to go wrong...And in New York in 1967, I noticed the reverse. Paramount had taken an option onone of my novels for a fairly large sum, and I intended to use some of it totake my family to the University of Seattle, where I had a job as writer inresidence. But as the date for leaving England approached, there was still nocontract. Half a dozen film deals had already fallen through; I found it hard tobelieve that this one would come off. But although the consequences would havebeen fairly serious if the deal had fallen through—we didn't have enough moneyto get from New York to Seattle—I declined to allow myself to worry. Stayingwith friends on Long Island, I rang my American agent—who told me that thecontracts had been sent weeks ago. Some incompetent underling had sent themsurface mail instead of airmail, and they were probably halfway across theAtlantic. I still declined to allow myself to get depressed—it is the writer'soccupational disease, and I have always tried to bully myself out of it. Thenext day, my agent rang back to say that he had got a new set of contracts, andParamount had agreed to pay up the moment he handed them over. I set out fromLong Island on an August afternoon; the heat in the train to Manhattan wasalmost unbearable; but I was feeling cheerful. Although Grand Central stationwas crowded, I managed to get a taxi immediately. Half an hour later, I signedthe contract; my agent said he'd try to get the cheque to me within forty-eighthours. I left the office, found another empty taxi outside, arrived at GrandCentral five minutes before the next train out to Long Island, and was back homewithin a couple of hours. There was a strange, sleepwalking sense of smoothnessabout that whole afternoon.Chance? Of course, in a sense. But I also felt that a kind of alertness andattention were allowing me to take advantage of chance. It was like being in acanoe on a fast current; the paddle doesn't have much to do, but its occasionalstrokes keep you clear of rocks.Human beings have a deeply ingrained habit of passivity, which is strengthenedby the relatively long period that we spend under the control of parents andschoolmasters. Moments of intensity are also moments of power and control; yetwe have so little understanding of this that we wait passively for some chanceto galvanize the muscle that created the intensity.But whether you use the negative methods of relaxation (which is fundamentally'transcendental meditation') or the positive method of intense alertness andconcentration, the result is the same: a realization of the enormous vistas ofreality that lie outside our normal range of awareness. You recognize that thechief obstacle to such awareness is that we don't need it to get through anordinary working day. I can make do fairly well with a narrow awareness and amoderate mount of vital energy. I have 'peak experiences' when I occasionallydevelop more awareness and more energy than I need for the task in hand; then I'overflow', and realize, for a dazzled moment, what a fascinating universe Iactually inhabit. It is significant that Maslow's 'peakers' were not daydreamingromantics, but healthy, practical people...That is my 'general theory'. My increasing sense of the vistas of reality thatlie outside my everyday preoccupations leads me to take a far more tolerantattitude towards assertions that do not fit into my range of experience. Thecybernetician David Foster came up with an interesting theory (which I describedin The Occult) to the effect that the universe shows every sign of being run ona series of 'cybernetic codes'. A kind of plastic biscuit with holes in the edgecodes my wife's washing machine; and an acorn is the plastic biscuit that codesan oak tree. This suggests to Dr Foster that acorns and human genes are coded bysome conscious intelligence, not simply by the operation of Darwinian selection.He thinks that cosmic rays would be of sufficiently high frequency to do thecoding—although this doesn't prove that they do. Now I don't know whether DavidFoster is fight. All I can say is that there is something about his theory thatcorresponds to my own glimpses of 'vistas of reality'.Neither do I know whether Robert Leftwich and Eunice Beattie and Arthur Guirdhamare right—exactly and precisely right. Mrs Beattie says that her own insightssuggest that reincarnation is not a fact; Guirdham say it is... But it seems tome that they are indicating facts that lie outside our present sphere ofacceptance. Becher and Stahl were not right when they suggested that all burningmaterials give off a gas called phlogiston; Descartes wasn't right when hesuggested that the movements of the solar system are due to 'vortices'. But theywere moving in the right direction; they were recognizing the existence of aproblem that had so far been overlooked, or only partially recognized. Sciencehas a nasty habit of declining to recognize the existence of problems that lieoutside its accepted field; this, I suspect, is due to tidiness rather than fearof the unknown. So the first task of an original thinker is to persuadescientists—or philosophers—that a problem does exist. When Freud tried tointroduce his ideas on hysteria to the Medical Society of Vienna, their firstline of defence was to deny that such a thing as male hysteria existed; Freudhad to produce a male hysteric before he could even get them to listen. Eventhen, the Society found it impossible to fit his theories into their own generalsystem, and so decided to ignore them. This is the usual way such thingsoperate, and it is to be expected.Charles Fort was particularly concerned with this problem. What he wanted toindicate, in four indigestible and impossible books, was that science keepsmistaking its own temporary theoretical boundaries for absolute limits. It isone thing to learn to ignore extraneous noises when you are working; it isanother to become so accustomed to ignoring them that you finally deny that theyexist. Fort never made his point. By collecting hundreds of odd occurrences fromnewspapers and printing them all side by side—fishes falling from the sky,skeletons of angels, devil tracks walking over snow-covered roof-tops—he onlyconvinced any scientists who happened to open The Book of the Damned that he wasinfinitely gullible. Fort lacked the philosophical training to make his point.It is only nowadays that scientists like Karl Popper, Michael Polanyi, AbrahamMaslow, are beginning to make it in a way that scientists can understand.And even they have only widened the boundaries of scientific tolerance. Theyhave not really made Fort's point: that science operates in a kind ofself-imposed blindness.Beyond all doubt, things are changing. In the nineteenth century, science had tooperate that way; the aggressive materialism and doubt was a part of itsstrength. What good would it have done if someone had recognized that Baron yonReichenbach was right, and that the human body has some kind of electrical'aura' or force? This piece of information would have been useless; and it mighthave hindered Freud in his important work of gaining general recognition for therole of the sex impulse and the subconscious mind. Now in the light of what weare beginning to learn about the body's life fields, and the way they fluctuatewith illness, it could suddenly become as relevant as the sexual theory was in1900.In the mid-1960s, the San Francisco writer Dick Roberts told me that his plantsgrew better when he talked to them and touched them. I wasn't skeptical, but Ipigeonholed this piece of information because I had no use for it. (To beginwith, I am no gardener.) Some time later—perhaps a year—my wife read out to mean item from a newspaper asserting that a horticulturist had discovered thatplants responded to sympathy. Again, I pigeonholed the information. A few monthsago, I read in a book called Supernature, by the zoologist Lyall Watson, anaccount of an experiment that suddenly offered me the general background to DickRoberts' observation. In 1966, an expert on lie detectors—polygraphs—calledCleve Backster found himself wondering whether a plant would show increasedelectrical activity when subjected to pain. A lie detector works partly on thechange in the electrical resistance of the skin when a man begins to sweat.Backster attached the polygraph to the leaf of a rubber plant in the office, andtried dipping another leaf in hot coffee. The plant didn't register. Backsterwondered whether he would get some result by burning the leaf with a match. Assoon as he thought this idea, the polygraph registered an increase in'perspiration'. The plant had read his mind. He tried dropping live shrimps intoboiling water next to the plant; as each shrimp died in agony, the polygraphneedle leapt. When a dead shrimp was dropped into the water, nothing happened.Another plant, a philodendron, became attached to Backster. Backster's assistanthad to produce the various shock responses on the plant, with the result that itwould register alarm when he came into the room, and relax when Backster camein—or even when it could hear his voice in the next room. But it was not simplythe voice it responded to. Surrounded by a lead screen that would cut out normalelectromagnetic vibrations, it still responded. Obviously, these 'vibrations'are not magnetic or electrical.Watson also mentioned in an interview published in The Guardian (21 September1973), that he and Backster had tried the same experiment with eggs. When eggswere dropped on the floor or fed to a dog, another egg attached to the polygraphrecorded a reaction. This was strongest when eggs were dropped into boilingwater. Oddly enough, when this happened, the eggs connected to the polygraphceased to react for several minutes, then would react again as before; Watson'sexplanation for this is that the egg fainted with shock.I cannot resist mentioning perhaps the weirdest thing in Watson's book. AFrenchman named Boils who took refuge in the pharaoh's chamber of the GreatPyramid noticed that old litter thrown there—including a dead cat—did not decay.This led to the amazing discovery that a cardboard pyramid built to exactly thesame proportions as the Great Pyramid has the same preservative effect. A deadmouse kept in it 'mummified' without stinking; a similar mouse kept in a shoeboxstank. But the strangest thing is yet to come. Razor blades kept in the pyramidremained sharp if they were kept in an east-west alignment. Watson has triedit—he shaved with the same blade for four months without it becoming blunt. ACzech firm has actually patented this device. Watson's guess is that the pyramidmay build up a magnetic field that causes a new crystalline 'edge' to form onthe blade.Observations like these—which have been confirmed in other laboratories (Watsonquotes sources)—obviously lend new perspective to Dick Roberts' assertion thathe can influence his plants by talking to them. But it also confirms the generalattitude to 'the occult' that I have argued in this book. I do not know whetherGuirdham is right when he says that children's night fears may be due todiscarnate entities. But if a plant can sense hostile thoughts, then it isprobable that a baby can. And if thought is carried like radio waves, then the'psychic ether' of our world is probably buzzing with hostile vibrations that ababy might pick up.Again, Guirdham's title We Are One Another takes on new meaning—or perhaps Ishould say, takes on meaning, for at first sight, it is meaningless. We are notone another. On the other hand, the basic assertion of his book is that thereare deep psychic links between the Cathars who died at Montsegur, so that eventsin the psyche of one of them could reverberate in the mind of another member ofthe group who was a total stranger. Many husbands and wives experience eachother's illness symptoms. (I mention in The Occult that I have experienced Joy'spregnancy pangs and been depressed by her toothache, before I knew she wassuffering from it. I once vomited all night when my first wife was sufferingfrom food poisoning a hundred miles away.) Guirdham claims that members of hisgroup of reincarnated Cathars also experienced one another's spiritual crises inthe form of spells of dizziness. Naturally, we are skeptical about this, for itcontradicts our experience that our inner-worlds are strictly private. But we goon from there to assume that this applies to all nature. And if Backster isright, this is untrue; human beings are the exception to the rest of nature. Inhis essay The Child in the House, Walter Pater talks about the 'web of pain'that stretches throughout nature; I remember being deeply struck by the phrasewhen I read the essay at fourteen or so. But if a rubber plant shudders when ashrimp dies, the 'web of pain' may be more than a poetic phrase.Again, I was struck when the painter William Arkle told me how the snakes in hisgarden seemed to respond to his thoughts. He bought himself a huge house—it usedto be a monastery—on a hilltop overlooking Weston-super-Mare. The garden turnedout to be full of adders and grass snakes. One adder made a habit of wanderingalong beside Bill Arkle when he walked down the drive. He had found it coiled inthe middle of the drive one day, in such a position that he couldn't drive thecar past without killing it. He got out of the car and prodded it awake with astick; it hissed and declined to move. He decided that perhaps he had betterkill it in case it bit one of the children; as soon as he moved towards it withthis intention, it hissed violently at him. Being by nature a gentle mystic, hedecided to let it live; the snake immediately moved to the side of the driveway,and went back to sleep. All he told me made it quite clear that the thing wastelepathic. Again, I pigeonholed the information. But clearly, it fits. All theindications are that the poets were right when they talked about 'livingnature'. And Tolkien's forest that hates hatchets may turn out to be more than apiece of whimsical fiction. All living things exist in a kind of unity, that isbroken by thought, the need to concentrate on particulars. We exist in a kind of'psychic ether' of which we are unaware...All of this certainly lends support to Guirdham's basic theories, although itdoes nothing to either prove or disprove his belief that a group ofthirteenth-century Cathars have been reincarnated in twentieth-century England.All that can be said is that the case he presents in his two Cathar books is themost challenging ever presented. It offers itself for examination. MoreyBernstein's case for the reincarnation of a Colorado housewife collapsed as soonas the Hearst newspapers began to probe it; it turned out that the reincarnatedBridey Murphy had lived opposite an Irishwoman in Chicago as a child, and beenin love with her son; the 'memories' of a former existence dredged up from MrsVirginia Tighe's subconscious under hypnosis turned out to be childhood memoriesof her Irish neighbor. But Guirdham's arguments do not depend upon anything asambiguous as hypnosis. And there were several people involved. This could be theopportunity for the most thorough and exhaustive examination of the case forreincarnation ever conducted. And if the results of such an investigation provedto be positive then Miss Mills' 'instructors' would have achieved their aim: ofmaking their case known to the widest possible audience. It would be a milestonein the history of physical research.Yet the really important change has already taken place. On my desk, as I write,I have two books that I acquired in the last couple of days. One is calledThirty Years Among the Dead, by Carl A. Wickland, MD, published in America in1924 by the National Psychological Institute. The other is The Cosmic Clocks, byMichel Gauquelin, published by the Henry Reguery Company in 1967. Theinteresting thing is that both books approach their subject from a scientificpoint of view; Dr Wickland states that he only intends to present the recordsand deductions of thirty years experimental research in the science of normaland abnormal psychology and within the first few pages he discusses thefascinating case of Sally Beauchamp, the girl with four distinctivepersonalities, recorded by Morton Prince. (I have discussed it in the TheOccult). But he starts Chapter One: 'The reality of an invisible worldsurrounding the physical world is for many difficult to comprehend, and the mindsphere is often limited to the visible and tangible; however, it requires butlittle thought to realize the constant change of matter as it occurs in threeforms, solid, liquid and gaseous, in its range back and forth between thevisible and the invisible...' And so on '... Considering the wonderfuladvancement of science into the field of nature's finer forces it isinconceivable that any thinking mind can fail to recognize the rationale of theindependent existence of the human spirit apart for [sic] the physical body.'This writing is basically gobbledygook. The book may or may not be valueless;but it will certainly convince no one but the converted.On the other hand, Gauquelin's study deals with biological clocks, how animalsand plants know the time of day, and kindred subjects. Opening it at random, Ifind in Chapter Eleven:'Around 1950, as we were preparing our critique of traditional astrology, wefound ourselves confronted, somewhat unwillingly, with a strange result. In oneof our research samples—composed of the birth dates of 576 members of the FrenchAcademy of Medicine—the frequency of the position of certain planets wasaltogether unusual. The phenomenon did not correspond to any of the traditionallaws of astrology, but it was interesting, nevertheless. What we had observedwas that a large number of future great physicians were born when the planetsMars and Saturn had just risen or culminated in the sky...' He goes on todescribe how he took a second sample of 508 physicians—a long job, since theactual hour of birth is not included in most reference books—and againdiscovered that most of them were born after the rise or the culmination of Marsand Saturn.One can sense the whole world of difference between the two extracts quoted. Oneis by a spiritualist who is determined to sound like a scientist; one is byscientist who finds himself flying to explain facts that so far have no place inthe framework of science. Gauquelin goes on to produce various hypotheses aboutthe influence of 'cosmic clocks' on our physical make-up. I do not know whetherhe is a better scientist than Dr Wickland, or whether he is more reliable. All Iknow is that he is treating his subject matter like a traditional scientist.This is how Rutherford and his colleagues worked when it was a question ofexploring the 'invisible' realm of the inside of the atom; the facts are takeninto account, hypotheses are constructed to fit them, and then research isundertaken to try to uncover more facts, to confirm or deny the theories.The 'occult' has not yet qualified for recognition as a science. But the daywhen occultists and spiritualists had to plead to be taken seriously is past.Certain facts are lying around where scientists cannot help tripping over them.And that is a situation which the tidy mind of the scientist finds intolerable.As Charles Fort might have expressed it: If the occult did not exist, sciencewould be compelled to invent it."}]
