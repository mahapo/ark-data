For the unprepared reader, hiswork presents a series of daunting obstacles. To begin with, there is the style,which is formidably abstract, and as unappetizing as dry toast. But a determinedreader could learn to put up with that. The real problem lies in the content,which is often so outlandish and bizarre that the reader suspects either a hoaxor a barefaced confidence trick. Books like Cosmic Memory , with its account ofAtlantis and Lemuria, seem to belong on the same shelf as titles like Our HollowEarth , or My Trip to Venus in a Flying Saucer . The resulting sense offrustration is likely to cause even the most open-minded reader to give up indisgust.This was, I must admit, my own experience when the publisher of the presentvolume approached me in the mid-1970s and asked me to write a book on Steiner. Iaccepted because I had always found Steiner an interesting figure. I first cameupon his name in my early teens; it was in a remarkable book called God Is MyAdventure , by Rom Landau. Landau begins his account by describing theexperience of a certain Baron V—, a German officer with whom the author becameacquainted during his student days in Warsaw. The Baron was a member of a flyingcorps on the western front in the First World War, and he developed a disturbingpsychic faculty: the ability to foretell which of his comrades would be killedwhen they flew out on a mission. This gift of prophecy threatened to wreck hishealth, so when he was advised to go and see a certain Dr Rudolf Steiner, heseized the idea with relief. Dr Steiner proved to be a quiet man with deep-seteyes, and he advised the baron to practise certain simple mental disciplines.These had the desired effect, and the unnerving gift vanished.Landau's account made it clear that Steiner was no charlatan messiah; wheneverpeople met this calm, serious man and heard him speak quietly and sensibly aboutthe ‘spirit world’, they felt he was speaking from direct experience.Over the years, I had picked up many copies of Steiner's books in second-handshops. I had dipped into them, but found the style off-putting. I promisedmyself that one of these days I would settle down to a systematic study ofSteiner's ideas, and the publisher's offer seemed to be the opportunity I hadbeen waiting for. So I accepted, and blew the dust off the dozen or so volumesof Steiner on my bookshelves.There seems to be a general agreement that An Outline of Occult Science isSteiner's most important book, so I started with that. It begins byacknowledging that ‘occult science’ is regarded with suspicion by many people, adanger to weak minds. It goes on: ‘All occult science is born from twothoughts…first, that behind the visible world there is another, the invisibleworld, which is hidden from the senses, and from thought that is fettered by thesenses; secondly, that it is possible for man to penetrate into that unseenworld by developing certain faculties dormant within him.’So far, so good. After another ten pages of introductory matter, Steinerlaunches into a chapter on the nature of man. And its opening paragraph proceedsto repeat what he has already said more briefly and effectively:Considering man in the light of occult science, we are at once reminded of itsgeneral characteristics. It rests upon the recognition of a hidden somethingbehind that which is manifest to the outer senses and to the intellect broughtto bear upon their perceptions. These senses and this intellect can apprehendonly a part of all that which occult science unveils as the total human entity,and this part is what occult science calls the physical body….I was already becoming irritated by this repetition of the words ‘occultscience’, and by what sounds like an attempt to impress by sheer wordiness(‘this part is what occult science calls the physical body’; why not just: ‘i.e.the body’). He goes on:In order to throw light on its conception of this body, occult science at firstdirects attention to a phenomenon which confronts all observers of life like agreat riddle—the phenomenon of death—and in connection with it occult sciencepoints to so-called inanimate nature, the mineral kingdom. We are thus referredto facts which it devolves on occult science to explain, and to which animportant part of this work must be devoted.Gurdjieff's followers suspect that he wrote certain works—like Beelzebub's Talesto his Grandson —in a deliberately complicated style, to force the reader tomake enormous mental efforts. I wondered at first whether this was Steiner'sintention: to weed out the lazy. But further reading makes it clear that this isSteiner's natural way of expressing himself.I persevered for another week, reading various other works by Steiner:Theosophy, Knowledge of Higher Worlds, Christianity as a Mystical Fact , andfinally gave up. I wrote a regretful line to the publisher telling him that,with the best will in the world, I just couldn't go through with it. In largedoses, Steiner simply infuriated me. The publisher was perfectly amiable aboutit. He approached that brilliant cultural historian of the ‘occult underground’,James Webb, who agreed to write the book.Alas, Webb began to show signs of mental instability in 1979, and on 8 May 1980,he committed suicide with a rifle. Webb and I had been in correspondence overthe years, and I was saddened by his death. I also found myself wonderingwhether his attempt to digest hundreds of yards of Steiner's woolly prose hadanything to do with his suicide. Webb's own drily ironic account of Steiner inhis book The Occult Establishment (1976)—in a chapter entitled‘Ginungagapp’—makes it clear that his book would have been written from theviewpoint of an ‘unbeliever’.But circumstances were to draw me back to Steiner. In 1982, I started makingplans to write a history of psychometry—the strange ability of certain people tohold an object in their hands and ‘see’ its history. This is by no means asabsurd as it sounds. The word was invented by J. Rhodes Buchanan, an Americanprofessor of medicine, in the mid-nineteenth century. A bishop named Polkhappened to tell Buchanan that he could distinguish brass in the dark bytouching it with his fingertips—it caused a peculiar brassy taste in his mouth.Buchanan noted this as a medical curiosity, and discovered that many of hisstudents possessed the same faculty. They were able, for example, to identifyvarious chemicals wrapped in thick brown paper packages, merely by touchingthem. But the strangest thing of all was when Buchanan discovered a man whocould hold a sealed letter in his hand, and ‘sense’ the mood and the backgroundof the person who wrote it.Buchanan's discoveries were taken up by a professor of geology named WilliamDenton; he discovered that ‘sensitives’ could hold a geological specimen—ameteorite, a piece of dinosaur bone, a fragment of tile from a Roman villa—andsee visions of its history. Denton, like Buchanan, was convinced that this was aperfectly normal human faculty, merely waiting to be developed, a kind of‘telescope into the past’. He had no doubt that it would revolutionize thescience of history, as historians trained themselves to hold some relic from abattlefield or death chamber, and to witness scenes from the past as if watchingsome ancient film material from the archives.Regrettably, the birth of ‘spiritualism’ in the 1850s led to bittercontroversies, and caused scientists to dismiss anything that sounded evenvaguely ‘occult’. Buchanan and Denton were tarred with the same brush as MadameBlavatsky and Daniel Dunglas Home (Browning's ‘Mr Sludge the Medium’) and theirattempt to create a new science was forgotten.That remarkable and irrepressible lady Madame Blavatsky also claimed to possessa certain power of psychometry. In her two major works, Isis Unveiled and TheSecret Doctrine , she states that the universe is permeated by a kind of psychicether called Akasa —telepathy and clairvoyance are ‘waves’ in this ether. Akasaalso records everything that has ever happened, like some incredible combinationof film camera and gramophone record, and the ‘Akasic (or Akashic) records’ canbe ‘played back’ by psychics and clairvoyants. Madame Blavatsky wrote a greatdeal about the history of Atlantis, Lemuria and other ‘ancient civilizations’,claiming to have acquired her knowledge direct from the Akasic records. And inhis book Cosmic Memory , Steiner makes much the same claim.All this has done Steiner's reputation no good. In The Occult Establishment ,James Webb represents him as a kind of gifted dabbler with the mind of ajackdaw. ‘Steiner's ideas form less of a “system” than an accumulation ofsometimes disconnected items. Thus from Theosophy he took the ideas of karma andreincarnation; from his mystical studies and possibly the O.T.O [a dubiousmagical order], a personal “Rosicrucianism”. He discovered an entirely newidiosyncratic and personal interpretation of Christianity, and somehow contriveda seeming coherence with these teachings for theories of the social and artisticlife of man.’ In other words, Steiner was an intellectual opportunist whopatched together his own religious system from attractive bits and pieces ofother people's ideas. And when he goes on to talk about the ‘gaggle of adoringwomen’ who caused the break-up of Steiner's first marriage, and a tale (told bySteiner's stepdaughter) of how her mother found Steiner in bed with one of hisdisciples, it is not difficult to read between the lines to his view of Steineras a pious fraud.In order to write the section of my Psychic Detectives that dealt with ‘TheAkasic records’, I had to renew my acquaintance with Rudolf Steiner. I read thebiography by Johannes Hemleben, and set out to trace the development of hisideas from his early days in the Goethe Archive, where he edited Goethe'sscientific writings. This led me to look at early works like The Philosophy ofFreedom and Goethe's World View . Rather to my surprise, I discovered thatSteiner was a philosopher and cultural historian of considerable brilliance.There was not the slightest flavour of the bogus in these works—on the contrary,they give the impression of a man who is totally fascinated by the history ofideas, and who tries to say what he has to say as simply and clearly as he can.The rather abstract quality of his style is due to complete lack of artifice; heis not out to impress—either with beauty of style, or with an obscurity thatmight be mistaken for profundity. A reference to Goethe, the man Steiner admiredabove everyone, led me to look up the passage in question, and it suddenlystruck me that this is the key to Steiner's style. To modern ears, Goethe'sprose sounds disagreeably stiff and stilted—even in novels like Wilhelm Meisterand Elective Affinities . The Conversations with Eckermann indicate that he eventalked like that: ‘Religion stands in the same relation to art as any other ofthe higher interests of life. It is merely to be looked upon as a material, withsimilar claims to any other vital material. Faith and want of faith are not theorgans with which a work of art is to be apprehended. On the contrary, humanpowers and capacities of a totally different character are required….’ Thethought is perfectly clear, but it is hard to imagine a modern sage, even if hehappened to be a university professor, expressing himself in this ratherabstract manner. I believe that, after years of working in the Goethe Archive inWeimar, Goethe's prose style simply became second nature to Steiner.I also found myself in deep sympathy with what Steiner is trying to do in theseearly works. Like the young H. G. Wells at about the same time, he wasfascinated by science and the scientific method. Yet he was revolted by thematerialistic world-picture of modern science. He wanted to show that it simplywouldn't hold water—that total material fails to account for the complexities ofthe universe and of human existence. But he was not content with denouncing iton vaguely poetic or artistic grounds. He wanted to get an intellectual crowbarunderneath it and overturn it from the foundations. Madame Blavatsky also spendsa great deal of time in Isis Unveiled attacking modern science; but as aspiritualist and an ‘occultist’ she never stood the slightest chance ofconvincing a single scientist. Steiner argues as someone with an immense graspof modern science and philosophy, and the result is impressive. If Steiner haddied before he took the leap into ‘occultism’, he would now be classified withBergson, Whitehead, Samuel Alexander, Hans Driesch, Edmund Husserl, MauriceMerleau-Ponty, and Karl Popper as a philosopher who wanted to demonstrate thatscientific materialism is too narrow .After reading these books I felt stricken with guilt—like a man who hascondemned someone as a crook and then discovered he is rigidly honest. It waspossible, of course, that Steiner had ‘sold out’ after about 1900, and decidedto settle for the rewards of a religious messiah; but on the evidence of hisearly writing, that seemed unlikely. Self-deception comes hard to men ofSteiner's type.Because I had become so fascinated by the development of Steiner's ideas, thesection I wrote about him in my history of psychometry—The Psychic Detectives—was far too long. When it came to a question of cutting the book by a fewthousand words, these pages on Steiner's philosophical ideas seemed an obviouscandidate. But removing them caused so much regret that I thereupon decided touse them as the foundation of a book on Steiner. I wrote to the publisher andasked him if he was still interested; fortunately, he was. So once again, I tooka deep breath and plunged into the works of Steiner.This time I decided to begin with the autobiography he had written two yearsbefore his death. It was a happy decision. Pupils had asked Steiner to writesomething about his intellectual development, and he did this in a series ofarticles that were published in the ‘house magazine’ of the AnthroposophicalSociety, The Goetheanum . Since he was writing for students and disciples, andnot for the general public, Steiner obviously felt that he could write aboutanything that interested him, and pause for lengthy ruminations whenever he feltinclined. After four hundred pages, he had only brought the narrative as far asthe year 1907, and at that point he died, worn out by the burdens of a messiahwith too many disciples. (There must have been times when he felt like a cakedivided into crumbs.) The result is a marvellously detailed account of his earlydevelopment which answers every major question. It also leaves no possible doubtthat there was any fundamental change of direction in Steiner's life. By theearly 1890s—by which time he was in his early thirties—Steiner had alreadydeveloped all the insights that were to form the basis of his ‘occult science’.W. B. Yeats once said that when he went to London, he was like an old brasscannon primed to explode. The same is true of Steiner when he went to Berlin in1897. He was prepared to launch a new vision of human evolution on the world.What then went wrong?—for there is no doubt in my mind that something did gowrong, leading to his early death at the age of sixty-four. (He had always beenin robust health, and might have been expected, like Goethe, to live into hiseighties.) I suspect that he made his first major mistake in agreeing to becomethe German head of the Theosophical Society, the organization founded by MadameBlavatsky. Intellectually speaking, Steiner was far more of a heavyweight thananyone in the Society. He had already formulated his basic philosophy. He hadnothing whatever to gain from association with people who were regarded asoccultist cranks, who believed that Madame Blavatsky was the mouthpiece ofSecret Masters who lived on mountaintops in Tibet. Worse still, the Theosophistsdiscovered a new messiah in 1909, a fourteen-year-old Hindu boy named JidduKrishnamurti, and announced that he was to be the next world saviour. Steinerflatly declined to accept this, and not long thereafter, severed his connectionwith the Theosophists. But it was too late to prevent himself being tarred withthe same brush as the Theosophists. It has done Steiner's reputation no goodwhatever to be bracketed with Madame Blavatsky.But there was another problem, which Steiner could not possibly have foreseen.In the nineteenth century, it was possible to be a celebrity and still have areasonable degree of privacy. And this was not simply because, in the daysbefore newspaper photographs, celebrities were not so easily recognized. CharlesDickens was involved in a train crash. He went to the guard and said: ‘Do youknow who I am?’ ‘Yes, sir’, said the man, ‘Mr Dickens.’ ‘Good,’ said Dickens,‘then do as I tell you,’ and proceeded to take charge of the rescue operation.But if the same guard had seen Dickens in the street or eating in a restaurant,he would certainly not have rushed up to him for his autograph. The change thatcame about in the twentieth century was largely due to new means ofcommunication: radio, cinema, mass circulation newspapers. These have had theeffect of widening the psychological gap between the ‘famous man’ and the man inthe street. If everybody in the civilized world knows the name of CharlieChaplin or Greta Garbo, then it is natural for most people to exaggerate theirimportance, to imagine them surrounded by some kind of magical aura. So theknowledge that one of these god-like figures is staying in a certain hotel isenough to cause crowds of people to stand around, hoping to catch a glimpse ofthe prodigy. Steiner grew to manhood in the age of Dickens, but he became acelebrity in the age of Charlie Chaplin. His biographer, Guenther Wachsmuth,mentions that, in the early days, Steiner tried to give personal help and adviceto as many of his followers as possible, but that this became impossible as hisfollowing swelled. Another biographer, Albert Steffen, speaks of the queues ofpeople waiting outside Steiner's door from morning till night, waiting to pourout their problems and ask his advice.Steiner also suffered from another consequence of the ‘celebrity mechanism’:malice. When a man is regarded with admiration (or, worse still, reverence) by alarge number of people, he is bound to arouse a hostility in those who feel,quite unconsciously, that they too deserve to be admired and revered. Steffencomments on the complete lack of malicious gossip among Steiner's own disciplesin those early years; they felt so exalted by Steiner's teaching that malicewould have been unthinkable. But this in itself would be enough to makeoutsiders feel that this was a rather disgusting clique, a mutual admirationsociety that badly needed the corrective of a little plain speaking. WhenSteiner decided to deliver his message to the world in the form of lectures andarticles, he felt that it was his task to explain what he had learned fromtwenty years of study and meditation. He probably expected bafflement or lack ofinterest; he can hardly have anticipated the tempest of hostility that led tothe burning down of the Goetheanum and attempts to beat him up in a hotel.Although Steffen says that Steiner was sustained by enormous spiritual strength,there is still a strong case to be made for the argument that he died ofdiscouragement.Since Steiner's death, his ideas have lived on in schools devoted to hiseducational theories, in farms based on his agricultural ideas, even inhospitals and clinics founded on his beliefs about the relation of the body andspirit. Yet the work that Steiner himself would have regarded as mostimportant—what might be called his ‘philosophy of spiritual activity’—has neversucceeded in percolating through to the educated public. You would expect a manof fairly wide culture to know something about Jung, something about theMaharishi, something about Buckminster Fuller and Marshall McLuhan, perhaps evensomething about Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. But even among intellectuals, very fewwould have the vaguest idea about Rudolf Steiner's philosophy.So before embarking on a systematic exposition of his life and works, let meattempt to sketch his fundamental idea. Once this has been grasped, everythingelse follows. Without this key, his work is bound to appear a disconnected chaosof theories and speculations.Steiner's starting point is the belief that ‘behind’ this material world,revealed by our senses, there is a supersensible or spiritual world. Thissounds, of course, like the central belief of most of the great world religions,but in Steiner's case there is an important corollary. He was also convincedthat, by a simple training, anybody can develop the faculty of seeing this otherrealm of being. He himself claimed to have achieved this ability, and he did hisbest to show his followers how to achieve it.It is important not to confuse Steiner's ‘supersensory perception’ withclairvoyance or mediumship. Unlike Madame Blavatsky, who started her career as aspirit medium, Steiner was deeply suspicious of spiritualism. It was not that hedisputed the basic facts: that there is life after death and that man cancommunicate with ‘spirits’. But he felt that the spiritualists were wastingtheir time by concentrating on these phenomena. Suppose you could pick up somekind of psychic telephone and dial Albert Einstein in heaven (or wherever heis). Would it teach you about the theory of relativity, or help you to grasp hisconception of space-time? Obviously not. If you want to know about these things,then you have to put a great deal of mental energy into learning about them. Andwhen you have done that, you will, in a sense, ‘know’ Einstein a great dealbetter than if you had been allowed to speak to him. And communicating withspirits, either through a ouija board or in the seance room, will not give youthe slightest conception about the realms of meaning that are hidden behind theface of material reality. This demands the development of a peculiar kind ofvision, an ‘inward vision’. And, according to Steiner, this inward vision isachieved in three distinct stages. The first he labels ‘thought’ (orimagination), the second ‘inspiration’, and the third ‘intuition’.This sounds harmless—and insipid—enough. But there is nothing insipid or vagueabout Steiner's exposition of the three stages. It is precise, detailed, andpragmatic. He never speaks with the accents of a would-be prophet trying to pullthe wool over your eyes. He is more like a teacher of mathematics, doing hisbest to make his students follow his reasoning.The first and most important stage of insight is thought. It is the mostimportant because it is the bridge between our ordinary, muddled state ofeveryday consciousness and the states of ‘higher knowledge’. I shall devote theremainder of this chapter to attempting to show exactly what Steiner means bythis first stage. Once this has been grasped, the reader has passed through thedoorway into the world of Steiner's own vision of human evolution.We may start from the simple observation that human consciousness spends most ofits time trapped in the physical world. According to Sartre, this is the basictruth of human existence; man is stuck in physical existence like a fly on flypaper. It is worth mentioning Sartre at this point, for his thought is in everyway diametrically opposed to Steiner, and can be used as a kind of philosophical‘ground bass’ against which Steiner's ideas can be measured. According toSartre, human life is meaningless and therefore tragic. When a man feelstired—or utterly bored with some repetitive routine—he may suddenly become fullyaware of this meaninglessness. He experiences the feeling ‘What am I doinghere?’ The world suddenly looks frightening and alien. Sartre calls this suddenrecognition of meaninglessness ‘nausea’ or ‘the absurd’. (Camus borrowed theterm from him.) According to Sartre, ‘nausea’ reveals the basic truth abouthuman existence: that ‘it is meaningless that we live and meaningless that wedie’. ‘Man’, says Sartre, is a ‘useless passion.’ We try hard to disguise thisfrom ourselves by living in the present moment, or allowing ourselves to becarried away by emotions, or simply by telling ourselves lies about the meaningof the universe. Sartre would undoubtedly dismiss Steiner's whole philosophy asa tissue of falsehood and self-deception, ‘mauvais-foi’.But Sartre never seemed to have noticed one interesting fact about humanconsciousness. In order to perceive something, I have to retreat inside myself.An obvious example would be listening to music: many people close their eyes andretreat into some ‘mind space’ behind the eyes in order to enjoy it. In the sameway, if I am deeply enjoying a book, I am no longer sitting in an armchair infront of the fire: I have floated off somewhere else .Now it may seem that this only applies to ‘artistic’ experience. Surely it is nolonger true when I am catching a bus, or eating a sandwich, or waiting for thetraffic light to turn green? But a moment's thought reveals this is not so. Ienjoy my sandwich most when I am relaxed—'inside myself’. That is why a typistchooses to eat her lunch on a quiet park bench and not in the middle ofPiccadilly Circus. When you are tense and irritable, your consciousness has comeup to the surface, so to speak, and you see the world as a bewildering mess. Ifyou try to read a newspaper article in this state, you do not ‘take it in’; youmay have to re-read the same paragraph several times. If you go to an artgallery in this state, you do not really see the pictures. You stare at them,but somehow you fail to ‘take them in’. And that phrase ‘take them in’ revealswhat we do when we really ‘see’ something. We take it inside ourselves, like atiger seizing its prey and dragging it deep into its lair.The explanation for this is quite simple. Our brains contain a giant library ofmemories—everything that has happened to us during the course of our lives, andeven (if Jung is correct) remote racial memories bequeathed to us by ourancestors. If all these memories were set out on shelves, as in a real library,the building would have to be as big as the earth.Scientists did not become aware of the vast extent of this brain-library untilafter 1933, when a neurosurgeon named Wilder Penfield made an interestingdiscovery. He was performing a brain operation on a patient who was wide awake(since the brain has no nerves, it does not feel pain). He happened to touch thetemporal cortex—the seat of memory—with a probe that carried a weak electriccurrent. As long as the probe was in contact, the patient experienced a memoryof childhood—a memory so precise and detailed that it was like re-living it.Penfield had accidentally caused some of the ‘memory tapes’ to play back. Eachcontact of the probe brought back one single memory in minute detail.Now consider a man's experience of his wife. When she comes into the room, hefeels he ‘knows’ her fairly well. Yet if some friend were to ask him to recountin detail the story of their courtship, he would begin to remember all kinds ofthings he had half-forgotten. And if his wife walked into the room again, hewould see her with ‘different eyes’. For by reviving these memories he has, ineffect, added a dimension of reality to her. We are all familiar with thisexperience of talking about someone who is not present, and feeling that we havesomehow come to know them better.What Sartre calls ‘nausea’ is merely surface perception . And it tells verylittle about the world around us. In order to really perceive the world, I mustretreat ‘inside myself’. In fact, if I can sink into one of those states ofinner peace and relaxed meditation that sometimes happen when ‘the pressure isoff’, I may feel that I am really seeing things for the first time. Everythingseems to become more rich and complex and interesting. The difference betweenthis perception and my everyday perception is like the difference between aDutch interior by Van Eyck and a Walt Disney cartoon of Donald Duck. I can onlyachieve this richer, deeper perception by sinking inside myself.Now clearly, all animals have this capacity to retreat ‘inside themselves’ tosome extent. But it seems a reasonable assumption that in the case, say, of cowsor dogs there is not much to retreat into. And there are many human beings whoare not much better off—Sartre says of the café proprietor in Nausea , ‘When hiscafé empties his head empties too’; and of his own father: ‘When he lookedinside himself he found a desert.’ We know that this is not strictly true; noone contains a desert, for we all have an immense library in our heads. But thebooks are usually inaccessible to us.The fact remains that human beings differ from all other animals because theworld inside them is so much better furnished that that of dogs and cats. Gazingout of the window of a train, I may reflect about my childhood, or about myrecent holidays, or a thousand other things, including Sartre and RudolfSteiner. Of course, much of this thought is mere free association, like driftingin a boat along a slow stream, staring up at the leaves. But the boat also hasan engine, and when necessary, I can think to some purpose. I can use my mind tosolve problems that would be quite insoluble to an animal.This is a fairly recent development in man's evolution. Our ancestors who builtthe first cities around 6000 BC were deeply religious—for some odd reason, manhas always been a religious animal—but they did very little thinking as such.They solved problems by common sense and rule of thumb. The first evidence thatman was using his mind to try to understand the universe is the Great Pyramid,built around 2600 BC, for there is strong reason to believe that it was agigantic astronomical observatory whose purpose was to help the priestscatalogue the stars. Stonehenge, built at about the same time, whatever otherfunctions it performed, also seems to have been designed as an astronomicalcomputer or calculator.But it is not until about two thousand years later, in the golden age of Greece,that we begin to encounter real thinking in the modern sense of the word. And,like all great revolutions, it occurred virtually overnight. We only have toread the platonic dialogues to see that Socrates and Plato enjoyed thinking asmuch as a football fan enjoys the cup final. They did it for pleasure. In theSymposium one of the guests at a banquet describes how Socrates once stood inthe same place for twenty-four hours thinking about a problem. No doubt this isuntrue, but it expresses something essential about the Socratic spirit. Itimplies that Socrates could forget the external world and take a twenty-fourhour voyage inside himself . A century later, Euclid spent a lifetime committingall the basic theories of geometry to paper, an activity that would have struckone of the early city builders as unbelievably boring. Yet for Euclid, geometrywas plainly as important as meat and drink.This faculty of thought is so new—for in the evolutionary sense, two or threethousand years is a mere blink of an eyelid—that we have not started to graspits significance. We all spend years at school learning to read and write; butjust under the surface, the primitive cave man wonders what on earth is goingon. The cave man is naturally passive . He feels himself to be a mere product ofnature. When he is hungry, he looks for food; when it rains, he looks forshelter. He merely reacts to problems. But the development of thought hasstarted to turn him into a different kind of creature. Thought is not afraid totry and control nature. And whenever he solves an important problem, manexperiences a curious flash of exultation, a momentary feeling that he is farmore powerful than he realized. Ancient man believed in gods; after the comingof thought, man began to realize that he himself contains fragments of godhood.These glimpses are usually brief, for the complexity of modern life keeps mostof us trapped in ‘surface perception’. We tend to feel that we are ‘creatures ofcircumstance’, victims of fate. Sartre calls this ‘contingency’, the feelingthat we are somehow unnecessary and superfluous. And this is due, to a largeextent, to our feeling that we possess very little control over ourselves. Whenwe get hungry, we feel miserable; when we are tired, we get bad-tempered; whenwe get tense, we bite our nails. And in moods of deep pessimism, we may feelthat life is a long-drawn-out battle with inevitable defeat at the end of it.Yet even in this state, the power of thought can catapult us back into optimism.We can study the process, for example, in Wordsworth's ‘Intimations ofImmortality’ ode. He begins in a thoroughly pessimistic mood, describing how, asa child, the world seemed to be ‘apparelled in celestial light’, and how thishas all changed: ‘The things which I have seen I now can see no more.’ ‘Heavenlies about us in our infancy’, but the ‘Shades of the prison-house begin toclose Upon the growing boy…’. Yet he goes on to admit that while, on thisbeautiful sunny day, ‘to me alone there came a thought of grief’, a ‘timelyutterance’ has given that thought relief, ‘And I again am strong.’ By thinkingdeeply about his reasons for gloom, he has thought himself back into a feelingof strength and inner certainty. Steiner would say that he has entered the worldof thought and achieved a deeper sense of reality. Wordsworth himself expressesthe same insight when (addressing his friend Coleridge) he writes:Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belieThy soul's immensity…All this begins to explain why Steiner says that entry into the ‘world ofthought’ is the first major step on the ‘inward journey’ that can lead to‘knowledge of higher worlds’. He argues that although modern man feels he knowsall about thinking, he has not even begun to grasp the true nature of thatrevolution that occurred in the time of Plato. He still feels ‘contingent’. Hisview of himself is still basically negative. This is because he fails torecognize that his inner world is a realm in itself, an interior universe in themost literal sense. He spends too much time in ‘surface perception’, and feelsthat the mind is merely a kind of mechanism for helping him to stay alive, as avacuum cleaner helps a housewife to keep the place tidy. He fails to grasp whatSir Edward Dyer meant when he said ‘My mind to me a kingdom is.’ This power totake voyages inside himself is new and strange. Where inward journeys areconcerned, modern man has only just passed his driving test, and is still toonervous to venture much beyond the end of the street. He actually possesses acompletely new power, a new dimension of mobility. Steiner saw it as one of hismain tasks to bring this recognition into the clear daylight of consciousness.It explains why his followers were so cheerful and optimistic. They felt that hehad given them a piece of extraordinary ‘good news’; yet it was a piece ofintellectual good news, not something that demanded faith or religious assent.There is yet another reason for evolutionary optimism. In the past ten thousandyears or so, man's survival has been mainly due to his capacity forconcentrating on particulars . He has developed a sort of mental microscope toenable him to deal with the endless problems and complexities of existence. Ithas now become second nature, and he peers through it all the time. But theproblem is that it limits his field of vision; it traps him in narrow horizonsof the present. The chief disadvantage of this microscope is that it causes himto exaggerate all his problems—to make mountains out of molehills. This meansthat his general view of human existence is far gloomier than it need be. He isalways getting himself into ‘states’ of anxiety about problems that he canovercome perfectly easily.Whenever some anxiety suddenly evaporates—either through his efforts or of itsown accord—he experiences a delightful sense of freedom, the feeling thatChesterton calls ‘absurd good news’. And this is not simply because the problemitself has vanished; it is because his relief gives him a sudden ‘bird's-eyeview’ of his own existence, and he is overwhelmed by a sense of distanthorizons. He realizes that he has been living in a kind of mental slum when heowns a palace. He sees that all the problems on which he wastes so much of hismental energy can be routed just as easily. He sees that his powers are fargreater than he believed, and that all that has prevented him from realizingthis sooner is this ‘mental microscope’ that traps him in boredom andtriviality. In a paradoxical sense he is already free, already happy, and only amisunderstanding prevents him from realizing it.What can we do about this? The basic answer was discovered by the modernpsychologist Abraham Maslow. It was Maslow who decided to study the psychologyof healthy people, and discovered that all healthy people seem to have regular‘peak experiences’, delightful sensations of bubbling happiness and freedom. Ashe talked to his students about peak experiences, they began to remember peakexperiences they had had in the past, but had forgotten about almostimmediately. And as they began talking and thinking about ‘peak experiences’,the students began to have peak experiences all the time. It was merely aquestion of thinking about them regularly, turning the mind in that direction .One more point. When Wilder Penfield was conducting his experiment on thecerebral cortex—with the patient still conscious—he discovered that, while thepatient was experiencing a kind of mental film of his own childhood, he was alsofully conscious of the room around him. This meant, in effect, that two streamsof consciousness were flowing simultaneously, without mingling. This surprisedhim because he had always taken the view that consciousness is an activity ofthe nerve cells (neurons), a mere product of the brain. But if that was so, thetwo streams ought to have mingled, like a hot and cold tap flowing into the samebowl. This seemed to suggest that something was keeping them apart. If the brainis a computer, then it has a ‘programmer’ who stands above its activity. Itcould be said that Penfield has proved the existence of the soul.Steiner spent his life fighting scientific ‘reductionism’—like the view thatawareness is a mere brain activity, as burning is the activity of a fire. Hetaught that man possesses a ‘controlling ego’, which is the highest of his‘components’. Half a century after Steiner's death, an American physician namedHoward Miller was to arrive at the same conclusion on purely medical grounds. *[text00005.html#fnr] It would be possible to devote a whole chapter to pointingout how many of Steiner's ‘occult’ insights have since been vindicated—or atleast supported—by modern science.The fundamental tenet of Steiner's teaching is that if we take the trouble torecognize the independent existence of the inner worlds of thought, and keep themind turned in that direction, we shall soon become increasingly conscious oftheir reality. We are not, as Sartre believed, stranded in the universe ofmatter like a whale on a beach. That inner world is our natural home. Moreover,once we can grasp this truth, we can also recognize that we ourselves possess an‘essential ego’, a ‘true self’, a fundamental identity that goes far beyond ourusual feeble sense of being ‘me’.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* [text00005.html#fn] See my Frankenstein's Castle , Chapter 7."},{"pageContent":"TwoChildhood of a VisionaryRUDOLF STEINER was fortunate in the landscapes of his childhood. He spent hisearly years surrounded by magnificent prospects of mountains and green plains.Born in Kraljevec in Hungary (now part of Yugoslavia) on 27 February 1861,Steiner later felt it was of symbolic significance that he grew up on thefrontiers of east and west. His father, a gamekeeper in the service of a count,left his job when he married, to become a telegraphist employed by the SouthernAustrian Railway. He was placed in charge of the station at Pottschach whenSteiner was two. It was a boring life, being part of the gigantic officialmachinery of the Austro-Hungarian empire. But for his eldest son, it had theadvantage of being as idyllic as Wordsworth's Lake District.He was fortunate in another way. All small boys are fascinated by what theirfathers do; and the electric telegraph operated by Johann Steiner was the latestand most exciting of nineteenth-century inventions. Invented a mere two decadesearlier by Samuel Morse (who also devised morse code), it was the firstmechanical instrument to eliminate distance, and make it possible for Vienna tospeak to Berlin, London to New York. Even the railway had only recently replacedthe coach as a means of travel. So although Steiner grew up in a small countrytown, he was surrounded by the latest modern technology—in twentieth-centuryterms it was like being born next to a launching site for space probes. He waslater convinced that it was the combination of these two influences—the beautiesof nature and the latest modern technology—that created his unique temperament,the blend of the scientist and the visionary.Steiner's family were Catholics, and he was baptized a Catholic. Although hesays very little about the religion of his childhood in the Autobiography, it isa reasonable guess that it played a vital part in his inner life, and helps toexplain why the figure of Christ plays such a central role in his laterphilosophy.When Steiner was eight, the family moved again, to Neudörfl, near the borderwith Lower Austria. This had the considerable advantage of being an hour's walkaway from the town of Wiener-Neustadt, in Austria, only twenty-eight miles southof Vienna, where Steiner would later acquire his education. The scenery was lessimpressive than at Pottschach—the Alps were now on the horizon—but there wascompensation in the beautiful woods that surrounded the village. The family waspoor, and in summer, Steiner used to go for long walks and return laden withstrawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, which formed an important additionto the dinner menu. He even walked to a mineral spring half an hour away with alarge clay jar, and returned with a gallon of the sparkling liquid to wash downthe noonday meal.It sounds an idyllic existence; but in reading about it, we have to take intoaccount the sheer dullness of living in the middle of nowhere; life was so quietfor the villagers that they all assembled at the station whenever a train drewup. What a brilliant young mind needed was mental stimulation. And this cameinto Steiner's life through a volume on geometry, lent to him by the assistantteacher at his school. Bertrand Russell, in his own autobiography, describes howhis earliest mental awakening came through reading Euclid, and it is importantto grasp that by temperament Steiner was closer to Russell than to MadameBlavatsky. He says:That one can work out forms which are seen purely inwardly, independent of theouter senses, gave me a feeling of deep contentment. I found consolation for theloneliness caused by the many unanswered questions. To be able to graspsomething purely spiritual brought me an inner joy. I know that through geometryI first experienced happiness.When he speaks of ‘many unanswered questions’, Steiner is not referring to greatuniversal problems—like where space ends—but to quite down-to-earth questionsthat consumed him with curiosity. For example, there was a textile factory closeto their house, and its raw material arrived by rail. Steiner was able to seethe material when it arrived, and again when it left, but he was never allowedinto the factory to see how it was transformed from one stage to the other. Thiswas the kind of thing that fascinated him. There was always a strong practicalstreak in Steiner. If he had been born in America, he might well have becomeanother Edison rather than a ‘spiritual teacher’.It is also interesting to note the way he speaks of geometry as ‘somethingpurely spiritual’. He means that it belongs to a world of the mind , which isindependent of the world of the body. But surely it is a misuse of language tocall this ‘spiritual’? Here a passage in Arthur Koestler's autobiography mayhelp us to grasp the central point. Koestler admits that he suffers from‘Chronic Indignation’ as some people have chronic indigestion. He describes howone day he was sitting on a park bench reading an account of Arab atrocitiesagainst Jews in Palestine, and how he experienced the familiar rush of adrenalininto the blood, and the desire to get up and do something violent. At thispoint, he opened another book about Einstein, and read a sentence that said thatthe General Theory of Relativity ‘led the imagination across the peaks ofglaciers never explored before by any human being’. He suddenly saw Einstein'sfamous formula—E=MC2 —‘hovering in a kind of rarified haze over the glaciers,and this image carried a sensation of infinite tranquillity and peace. Themartyred pioneers of the Holy Land shrank to insignificance.’This is clearly what Steiner experienced as he became absorbed in geometry.I said to myself: the objects and events seen by means of the senses exist inspace. This space is outside man; but within him exists a kind of soul-space,which is the setting for spiritual beings and events. It was impossible for meto regard thoughts as mere pictures we form of things. To me they wererevelations of a spiritual world seen on the stage of the soul. To me, geometrywas knowledge which man himself apparently produces, but its significance iscompletely independent of him. Of course, as a child I could not express thisclearly to myself, but I felt that knowledge of the spiritual world mustactually exist within the soul as an objective reality, just like geometry.Here we have the essence of Steiner's thought. He is saying: If we can developthis capacity to turn to this peaceful, tranquil world of mental objects, we cangradually develop the ability to see more and more distant horizons in thisinner world. When I settle down to read a book, I have moved into the mentalworld, but only into its backyard; my mental horizon remains limited. If thebook fascinates me and moves me deeply, I leave this backyard, or ante-chamber,and move deeper and deeper into the mind space inside me. As I do this, I have astrange sensation which could be compared to gliding. It is as if the mind hadmanaged to rise above the turbulent air of daily trivialities, into a peaceful,cloudless realm where it can glide silently, gently rising and sinking with aircurrents. No one who has ever experienced this sensation can forget it. It seemsto promise a completely different kind of life, no longer tied to the ‘thousandnatural shocks that flesh is heir to’. There is a breathtaking sensation offreedom, and a sense that this is a foretaste of what human existence mightbecome.What becomes very clear from Steiner's autobiography is that he knew thisinstinctively. Living in this peaceful environment, watching the seasons changethe trees from brown to green, he was able to retreat into the regions of themind in a way that would be difficult for a modern city dweller. His teacherintroduced him to music—he played piano and violin—and taught him to draw. Fromthe village priest he learned about the politics of the Austro-Hungarian empire,and the passionate desire of Hungarians to be allowed to speak their ownlanguage and develop their own culture. The same priest gave him a basicknowledge of astronomy, teaching him about eclipses of the sun and moon. Steinerwas also profoundly moved by church rituals. Yet his father was a freethinker,so he was confronted by this stimulating contradiction between the world ofbelief and the world of scepticism. When his father and the assistant stationmaster of a nearby village sat under the linden trees in the evening, theyargued incessantly about politics; the young Steiner listened with fascination,observing with amusement that whenever one said Yes, the other said No. Like atree, his mind was putting down deep roots, seeking instinctively for thenourishment it needed to grow. Science, politics, religion, music—all wereabsorbed. And when the doctor from Wiener-Neustadt told him about Goethe,Schiller, and Lessing, it was a revelation of yet another new world. By the ageof ten, life had become a series of discoveries. Few children can have had theopportunity to develop as gently and naturally as Steiner, absorbing nourishmentlike a tree.At the age of eleven, it was time to go to secondary school. Faced with a choiceof ‘gymnasium’, with its classical education, or the ‘realschule’, with itsemphasis on science and technical training, his parents decided on the technicalschool; they hoped that in due course he would become a railway engineer. Thismeant daily journeys to Wiener-Neustadt—by train in the morning, and back toNeudörfl on foot in the evening, when there were no suitable trains. ‘Shades ofthe prison house began to close.’ The noisy modern city bewildered him, and forthe first year at school he did badly. Then, as he began to adjust to the newpace of life, the old voracious appetite for knowledge reawakened. He had asense that the world was full of a million things he wanted to know, so he readwithout any specific sense of direction. But at least he had an extraordinarypersistency. His headmaster had written a book about physics, in which he triedto explain the attraction and repulsion between planets—and all other physicalbodies—in terms of a universe packed with billions of atoms, all constantlybanging into one another. From Steiner's account, it sounds as if his headmastersimply failed to grasp the Newtonian theory of gravitation; at all events, youngSteiner found it all very stimulating, although he was baffled by themathematics. When he heard the name of Immanuel Kant, Steiner saved up andbought a copy of The Critique of Pure Reason and, totally unprepared by anyphilosophical training, spent his days trying to master its abstruse arguments.Because he found history classes so boring, he separated the Critique intosections, hid them inside his history book, and read them in history lessons. Hemade up by reading his history direct from the textbooks, and received a mark of‘excellent’.Fortunately, Kant's philosophy did him no harm. Other German men of genius havebeen shattered by it; the poet Kleist and the philosopher Fichte were bothconvinced that Kant's teaching proves that we can never know anything forcertain, and had to wrestle with despair. Steiner, with peasant common sense,treated it purely as a stimulating intellectual exercise, and revelled in it. Inthe same way, he gulped down a nine-volume History of the World , and receivedtop marks in the history class.Steiner was a natural ‘autodidact’. He says that his school lessons passed in akind of dream, but as soon as he began to read what he wanted to read, his mindwoke up, and he experienced a sense of ‘full consciousness’.By the time he was fifteen, he was so obviously brilliant that he was given thejob of tutoring fellow students—not only from lower classes, but from his own.So Steiner was introduced to his life's work of teaching from an early age. Heamused himself by playing a game of intellectual hide-and-seek with one of histeachers, Josef Mayer, who taught literature. Steiner somehow discovered thatMayer was an enthusiastic admirer of the philosophy of Johann Friedrich Herbart,an educationalist and psychologist whose views would cause him to be classifiedtoday as a ‘positivist’ (i.e. a kind of materialist). (Herbart has much incommon with the twentieth-century thinker John Dewey.) All Steiner's instinctswere anti-materialistic. So in his essays, he began expressing views that wereopposed to Herbart, without ever mentioning him by name. One essay concluded:‘Such a person is psychologically free.’ Mayer looked ironically at hisfifteen-year-old pupil and said: ‘There is no such thing as psychologicalfreedom.’ ‘Yes, there is,’ replied Steiner, ‘There is psychological freedom, butthere is no “transcendental freedom” in ordinary consciousness.’ Mayer saidsternly: ‘I think you have been reading philosophy. You had better stop—it onlyconfuses your thoughts.’ Relations between them, Steiner admits, continued to bestrained.When Steiner was eighteen, he began to attend the Institute of Technology inVienna. The railway company seems to have been extremely obliging, and agreed totransfer his father to a station—Inzersdorf—sufficiently close to Vienna forSteiner to make the daily journey.By this time, Steiner had confronted the question that was to be the startingpoint of his philosophy. The science he loved so much told him that man was ananimal, and that animals are machines. This idea revolted him; all his instinctsrebelled against it. It contradicted all those strange moods of delight that hehad so often experienced among woods and mountains, and which told him that manhas the potentiality of becoming a god. One of his closest schoolfriends inWiener-Neustadt infuriated him by professing to believe that man is a whollymaterial being, and that all his thoughts can be explained in terms of brainchemistry. One day, Steiner accompanied his friend to the railway station inVienna, and as the train was about to pull out, tried to express all hisdetestation of materialism in one passionate outburst. ‘You maintain that to say“I think” is merely a result of brain and nerve-processes. You believe that onlythese processes are real. You think the same thing applies when you say “I see”,“I walk”, and so on. But please note that you never say “my brain thinks”, “mybrain sees”, “my brain walks”. If you really believe in your own theory, youshould change the way you express yourself. The fact is that you are lying whenyou say “I”. But you cannot help but follow a healthy instinct that contradictsyour own theory. Your actual experience is quite different from the ideas youdream up in your theory. Your very consciousness proves that your theory is alie.’ At that moment, the train pulled out. As Steiner walked back, heexperienced twinges of conscience at trying to refute materialism in this crudemanner. But what mattered was not just to give philosophically convincingproofs, but to express his total conviction that the human ‘I’ is a concretereality. That conviction was the foundation upon which he built his immensestructure of ideas.It is hard for us nowadays to grasp just how tormented Steiner felt byscientific materialism—as did so many other great intellects at that time. Yetunless we try to grasp it, we cannot even begin to understand how Steiner cameto create the vast system he called ‘occult science’. In past centuries, whatwas taught in schools and universities was the most advanced knowledge of thetime, and students could absorb it without any qualms or doubts. In Steiner'stime, schools and universities were teaching ideas that seemed to millions ofpeople outrageously untrue. They were teaching—as the latest word in modernthinking—that man is a machine, that religion is a superstition, and thatevolution is a purely mechanical process based on survival of the fittest. Thismade respectable churchmen see red, but their honest indignation only seemed tomake things worse. They always seemed to come off worse in arguments withscientists—as when T. H. Huxley wiped the floor with Bishop Wilberforce in thefamous Oxford debate on evolution in 1860. (When Wilberforce asked whetherHuxley was descended from an ape through his grandfather or grandmother, andHuxley replied that he would not be ashamed to be descended from an ape, but hewould be ashamed to be connected with a man who used his great gifts to obscurethe truth, even hostile members of the audience burst into applause.) So for menlike Steiner, who detested materialism yet felt no sympathy with orthodoxreligion, it was of vital importance to try to find some scientific way ofrefuting the materialists. This is why dozens of pages in the early part ofSteiner's autobiography are taken up with descriptions of the philosophers hedevoured. He was seeking some argument that would disprove materialism once andfor all.For Steiner, one of the most important of these intellectual allies was thephilosopher Fichte. A century earlier, Fichte had been plunged into despair bythe philosophy of Kant, which seemed to prove that our senses are liars, andthat we can never know ‘things as they are’. If that is true, then man is littlebetter than a worm. Then Fichte made an important mental leap. He noticed that,when we sit thinking, we often feel confused and uncertain. But the moment a manis launched into vigorous action, his doubts vanish like mists in the morningsun. According to Fichte, mere thinking is bound to tell us lies, because itputs us into a passive state of mind. So when the thinking self says ‘I’, it isnot the true ‘I’ speaking, only half an ‘I’. Let the thinker get up out of hisarmchair and try to find ways of living his thought; only then will his thinkingbe powerful and accurate.Fichte's thinking had the bracing effect of a cold shower on the perplexed youngstudent. When some materialist told him ‘The ego is an illusion’, he couldretort: ‘Your ego seems to be an illusion because you won't get out of yourarmchair. Get rid of your lukewarm scepticism and you'll soon see that the “I”is a reality.’Even more important was the influence of Professor Franz Brentano, who taught atthe University of Vienna, and whose public lectures Steiner was allowed toattend. Brentano not only became a major influence on Steiner's thought,but—through the influence of his follower Edmund Husserl—one of the mostimportant influences on twentieth-century philosophy.Brentano was concerned at the way materialism had come to dominate psychology.The English philosopher Hobbes had declared that the mind does not exist, for itis a contradiction to talk about an ‘immaterial substance’. The Scottishphilosopher Hume said that when he looked inside himself, he did not discoversome ‘essential David Hume’, but merely a lot of sensations and ideas, driftingaround like leaves in the wind. James Mill asserted that the mind is a machineand that its laws are mechanical. His son John Stuart Mill shrank from thisextreme view, but suggested that our thoughts are a matter of ‘chemistry’. Bythe time of Brentano, this view had become known as ‘psychologism’. So, forexample, according to psychologism, our ideas of good and evil are due to a kindof mental chemistry, just as our ideas of hot and cold are due to a kind ofphysical chemistry. If this view is correct, then it is inaccurate to talk abouta ‘mental act’; all ‘acts’ are really physical.Like Fichte, Brentano had one simple and powerful insight. He declared: There isa basic difference between a mental and physical act. If I slip on the snow andfall flat on my back, that is an unintentional physical act. But there is nosuch thing as an unintentional mental act . When I think, I have to think aboutsomething; I have to focus my mind on it. You could compare all mental acts(thinking, willing, loving, trying to remember something) to a searchlight beamstabbing into the darkness. There is an element of will, of ‘intentionality’, inall mental activity. So it is quite inaccurate to compare mental activity tochemistry, or to a kind of drifting, like leaves on a stream. It flowspurposefully or not at all.This is exactly what the young Steiner wanted to hear. His whole life so far hadbeen a struggle for freedom, a fight to escape his poverty-strickenworking-class existence. Books and ideas had been the beacons along his road. Totell him that man possessed no free will was an outrage to his common sense. NowBrentano was saying the opposite: mental activity is, by its very nature,purposeful. And anybody who has grasped this can also see that our mostrewarding mental activity is that which is most purposeful. Conversely, theleast rewarding is the least purposeful—the kind of listless, bored activity weindulge in when we don't know what to do with ourselves. According to thematerialists, there was no real difference between highly rewarding mentalactivity and bored mental activity. Now Steiner could see that this was obviousnonsense. And such a realization was enough to galvanize him into working with anew determination and optimism.It must have been a strange, rather breathtaking sensation to feel that he,Rudolf Steiner, knew better than hundreds of distinguished scientists andphilosophers. But such a sensation has been experienced by every originalthinker when he sets out to express his own vision of truth. ‘I must create myown system or be enslaved by another man's,’ said William Blake; and by the ageof eighteen, Steiner felt he had laid the foundations of his own system.It was at this point that he met a man who was to exercise a decisive influenceon his future: Karl Julius Schröer, professor of the history of Germanliterature at the Technical Highschool. Steiner found his lectures on Goethe andSchiller a revelation. He had learned about Goethe many years before from hisdoctor friend; but Schröer's enthusiasm brought it all to life. He made Steinerunderstand the enormous impact that Goethe's arrival made on the literary sceneof the eighteenth century—the same kind of impact made by Wordsworth and LordByron in the century of Alexander Pope and Dr Johnson. Steiner read Faust —inSchröer's edition—for the first time and found it magnificent. Flattered to havesuch an attentive student, Schöer was soon inviting Steiner to his home, andtalking to him about the second part of Faust , which he was at present engagedin editing.Goethe was the single greatest influence in Steiner's intellectual life. ReadingFaust convinced him once and for all that he could dismiss the materialistphilosophers. What must have delighted him even more was that Goethe had sharedhis own enthusiasm for science, and had created his own non-materialisticphilosophy of science. For Goethe, nature was ‘God's living garment’, and couldnot be understood except by recognizing that it is constantly in a process ofcreation. There is a famous story of how Goethe and Schiller met at a meeting ofthe Natural Science Society. As they left the building together, Schillerremarked that he wished scientists would not make everything so fragmentary anddisconnected, because it made it hard to follow. Goethe, who until then had feltno sympathy for Schiller, was struck by this remark, and launched into adescription of his own vision of science. ‘There is another way of apprehendingnature, active and living, struggling from the whole into parts…’. But when hewent on to explain that he believed that all plants had developed from oneoriginal plant, Schiller shook his head. ‘That's not an empirical experience.It's just an idea .’Now, as he learned about Goethe's scientific ideas from Schröer, and began toread some of his writings on science for himself, Steiner at last began todevelop his own spiritual philosophy.Before we go any further, it is necessary to take into account another vitalthread in Steiner's development. So far, we have considered only hisintellectual development and his struggle to disprove materialism; in thisrespect, his development could be compared with that of many of hiscontemporaries, from Carlyle and Nietzsche to Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells. Butthere was one important respect in which Steiner differed from thesedistinguished contemporaries. From the beginning, he had been the possessor of astrong ‘psychic faculty’. As a small boy, he had been sitting in the stationwaiting room when the door had opened, and a strange woman came in. Steinerobserved that she resembled other members of his family. The woman stood in themiddle of the room and said to the small boy: ‘Try and help me as much as youcan—now as well as in later life.’ Then she walked into the stove and vanished.Steiner decided not to tell his parents; he was afraid of being scolded forsuperstition. But he noticed that his father was sad the next day. Later, hediscovered the reason: a female relative had committed suicide not far away. Herdeath had occurred at the time Steiner saw the woman in the waiting room.Describing this later in life, Steiner added:From that time onward a soul-life began to develop in the boy which made himentirely conscious of worlds from which not only external trees or mountainsspeak to the human soul, but also the Beings who live behind them. From thattime onward the boy lived together with the spirits of nature that can beobserved in such a region. He lived with the Creative Beings that are behindobjects…and he submitted to their influence in the same way that he submitted tothe influence of the spiritual world.Readers who can accept Steiner's struggle against scientific materialism mayfind such comments wholly unacceptable. There can be no doubt whatever that mostof us feel a healthy reluctance to devote much attention to such matters asghosts, life after death, the ‘supernatural’. The kind of people who take aninterest in these things are often gullible or overimaginative. Yet anyone whodecides to study the ‘paranormal’ in a spirit of scientific scepticism soonrealizes that it cannot be dismissed as superstition or wishful thinking. Thebody of evidence for ghosts, poltergeists, ‘second sight’, precognition,psychokinesis, telepathy, and ‘out-of-the-body-experiences’ is simplyoverwhelming. We have already seen how J. Rhodes Buchanan came to investigate abishop's claim that he could distinguish brass in the dark by the taste it madein his mouth, and ended by discovering that many of his students could describethe history of an object by simply holding it in their hands. Sensible, ordinarypeople are always encountering such anomalies, and discovering that they cannotbe explained away as delusions.I have suggested elsewhere * [text00006.html#fnr] that our remote ancestorsprobably took these ‘psychic faculties’ for granted (and, as we shall see later,Steiner also believed this). We have deliberately ‘narrowed’ our senses to copewith the highly complex experiences of civilized existence. Our ancestors neededa ‘sixth sense’ to warn them when a wild animal was lying in wait; the moderncity dweller would find such a faculty superfluous. The curious case of PeterHurkos seems to support this view. Hurkos was a Dutch house painter who fell offa high ladder and smashed his skull. When he woke up in hospital, he found thathe could read people's minds, and ‘sense’ the history of an object by holding itin his hand. There was one minor problem: he was totally unable to concentrateon the ordinary affairs of everyday life, with the result that he found itimpossible to hold down a job. It was not until someone suggested that he shoulduse his psychic powers on the stage that he solved the problem of how to make aliving. It seems conceivable that our remote ancestors were as ‘psychic’ asHurkos—and as unable to focus the mind for more than a few mintutes at a time.In teaching ourselves to concentrate, we have voluntarily abandoned that widersensitivity to the universe that is still possessed by many primitive tribes.‘Psychics’ are people who, through some accident of birth or heredity, stillpossess these primitive abilities.Yet where Steiner is concerned, this theory raises an immediate problem. Steinerwas not in the least unable to concentrate on the affairs of everyday life. Hisability to read Kant in his early teens argues a remarkable faculty ofconcentration. He was an excellent student who gained high marks in science,mathematics, and history. How can all this be reconciled with the ‘atavistic’theory of psychic abilities?Here Steiner himself suggests the answer: that his psychic abilities were theoutcome of a profoundly meditative temperament. His autobiography makes it clearthat he combined his enthusiasm for science with a poetic temperament akin tothat of Wordsworth. (In fact, we may recall that Shelley was also a scienceenthusiast.) Like Wordsworth, he had the ability to enter into profound statesof inner peace. He saw no contradiction between these states and his love ofscience and philosophy: on the contrary, it seemed obvious to him that when webecome absorbed in science or philosophy, we retreat into that ‘interiorcastle’.It is important to understand why modern man has so much difficulty inexperiencing the ‘reality’ of nature as Wordsworth experienced it. In order tocope with his highly complex life, he has developed the mechanical part of hisbeing. We might call this mechanical part ‘the robot’. When I learn somethingdifficult—like driving a car or speaking a foreign language—I have to learn itconsciously, with painful effort; then my ‘robot’ takes it over, and does it farquicker and more efficiently than ‘I’ can do it. The trouble with the robot isthat he not only ‘takes over’ the things I want him to do, like driving my carand typing this page; he also takes over many things I would prefer to domyself, like listening to music or going for a country walk. When I am in ahurry I may even eat ‘automatically’, without really enjoying it. The robottends to rob us of experience.In The Doors of Perception , Aldous Huxley described his experience with thepsychedelic drug mescalin. He was staggered as ‘reality’ suddenly becameoverwhelmingly real . Everything he looked at seemed to exist with an almostpainful reality, as if it was throbbing with its own fullness of being. Even thefolds in a piece of cloth struck him as infinitely fascinating and beautiful.The mescalin had put the robot out of action, and allowed the mind to seereality ‘naked’.But Huxley made another important point. Mescalin also made him aware of thevastness of his own inner world. He wrote:Like the earth of a hundred years ago, our mind still has its darkest Africas,its unmapped Borneos and Amazonian basins. In relation to the fauna of theseregions we are not yet zoologists, we are mere naturalists and collectors ofspecimens…Like the giraffe and the duck-billed platypus, the creatures inhabiting theseremoter regions of the mind are exceedingly improbable. Nevertheless, theyexist…If I have made use of geographical and zoological metaphors, it is not wantonly,out of a mere addiction to picturesque language. It is because such metaphorsexpress very forcibly the essential otherness of the mind's far continents, andthe complete autonomy and self-sufficiency of their inhabitants. A man consistsof what I may call the Old World of personal consciousness and, beyond adividing sea, a series of New Worlds—the not too distant Virginias and Carolinasof the personal subconscious and the vegetative soul; the Far West of thecollective unconscious, with its flora of symbols, its tribes of aboriginalarchetypes; and, across another, vaster ocean, at the antipodes of everydayconsciousness, the world of Visionary Experience…Some people never consciously discover their antipodes. Others make anoccasional landing. Yet others (but they are few) find it easy to come and go asthey please…Steiner, it seems clear, was one of these rare types of human being who cantravel without difficulty in this inner universe.Huxley goes on to say that there are two methods of visiting this strangecontinent: drugs (like mescalin) and hypnosis. Steiner's method is certainlyrelated to hypnosis. When a patient is hypnotized, he is persuaded to sink intoa state of deep calm, and to forget his links with the physical world. Formodern man, this is an exceedingly rare state, for the outer world clamours forso much of his attention that he finally abandons the habit of trying to leaveit behind. He could be compared to a parent who has become accustomed to beingawakened a dozen times a night by a teething baby, and acquires the habit ofsleeping so lightly that the least sound can draw him back to consciousness.But to visit our inner worlds—even to the extent of becoming deeply absorbed ina book, or listening to music—we have to get rid of this habit ofover-alertness. We need to acquire the habit of deep relaxation, of forgettingall our anxieties (most of which, after all, are quite unnecessary). Steinerseems to have been born with this habit, as Wordsworth was, and the idyllicbackground of his childhood allowed it to become deeply ingrained.It is exceedingly difficult to follow Steiner into the ‘supersensible worlds’that he describes in his work—although the attempt must later be made. But wecan at least understand what he means when he writes: ‘To me, the spiritualworld was an immediate reality . The spiritual individuality of each person wasrevealed to me in complete clarity.’ For most of us have developed some degreeof being able to grasp a person's essence, and to recognize intuitively thelevel of maturity they have achieved. But it is altogether more difficult tounderstand what Steiner means when he goes on to say: ‘When someone died Ifollowed him further on his journey into the spiritual world. One time after thedeath of a former classmate, I wrote about this side of my inner experiences toone of my teachers at the Realschule . He replied in an unusually kind letter,but with not a single word did he refer to what I had written about the deadschool-mate.’ This is hardly surprising. The schoolmaster must have suspectedthat it was either imagination or an attempt to impress. Steiner goes on: ‘Andit was always the same in regard to my experience of the spiritual world. No onewas interested to hear about it. At most…people would start to talk aboutspiritualism. Then it was I who did not wish to listen. To approach the spiritin this way was repellent to me.’And then, in 1879, Steiner made the acquaintance of a man to whom he could speakopenly about his spiritual insights, and who was able to reply with insights ofhis own. Suddenly, the eighteen-year-old visionary no longer felt that he was asolitary misfit in a world of blinkered materialists. A new phase in his lifewas about to begin.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* [text00006.html#fn] In The Occult , Chapter 1."},{"pageContent":"ThreeThe Goethe ScholarTRAVELLING daily from Inzersdorf to Vienna by train, Steiner made theacquaintance of a middle-aged factory worker named Felix Koguzki, who spent hisspare time gathering herbs which he sold in Vienna. Koguzki was uneducated butobviously intelligent, and he often expressed his deep religious convictions inthoroughly obscure language. Steiner found him interesting, and deliberatelycultivated his acquaintance. Steiner said of him: ‘He gave the impression ofbeing simply the mouthpiece for a spiritual content seeking utterance fromhidden worlds…gradually it seemed to me as if I were in the company of a soulfrom bygone ages who, untouched by civilization, science and modern views,brought me an instinctive knowledge of the past.’Steiner adds the interesting comment that nothing could be ‘learned’ fromKoguzki in the usual sense, but that ‘because he had a firm footing in thespiritual world’ it was possible to obtain through him important glimpses ofthat world. He often visited Koguzki at his peasant home in the village ofTrumau, and felt completely comfortable in its atmosphere of simple piety.The real significance of his meeting with Koguzki is that, for the first time,Steiner could speak openly about his own experiences of spiritual insightwithout fear of ridicule or the danger of being regarded as a faintlyembarrassing crank.In his autobiography, Steiner does not mention Koguzki's name—it was laterdiscovered through the research of one of his disciples. Unfortunately, this isnot true of another acquaintance of the period whose influence on Steiner wascrucial. Steiner's friend and follower Edouard Schuré later spoke of thismystery man as ‘the master’, and said that he was ‘one of those potentpersonalities who are on earth to fulfil a mission under the mask of some homelyoccupation’. Schuré deduced from Steiner's descriptions that he was an‘Initiate’. All we know is that this man pointed out to Steiner certain passagesin Fichte which helped Steiner to see his way clear to refuting the scientificmaterialism of his contemporaries. Fichte made him feel that the human ‘I’ is aconcrete reality, not an illusion produced by the physical body, and thattherefore man has genuine free will, which can be used to penetrate thespiritual reality behind appearances.In spite of his obsession with the inner worlds of thought—which he identifiedwith spiritual reality—Steiner was no introvert. He seems to have thrown himselfinto the student life of Vienna with a passion that seems unusual in such aserious-minded youth. He joined the German Reading Room of the TechnicalHighschool, and was later elected its librarian, then its chairman. As librarianhe wrote begging letters to authors asking for copies of their works; throughthe library and the university he made the acquaintance of many writers andthinkers. In the Autobiography he is inclined to speak about such encounterswith a certain poker-faced gravity, as if they were milestones on his pilgrimageto truth. But it does not take much imagination to place oneself in the shoes ofthis eighteen-year-old stationmaster's son, with no money and no prospects, andto recognize that what really preoccupied him was the question of getting a‘start in life’. What could he hope to become? His father wanted him to be anengineer, but he never seriously entertained that idea for a moment. What then?A schoolmaster—perhaps eventually a university lecturer? That was a possibility.But in spite of his intellectual discipline, Steiner lacked the academictemperament; there was too much of the poet in him. Like all talented young menwith no money, he faced the world without any clear idea of what he wanted to dowith his life. So he seized every opportunity to meet writers, artists,philosophers, or any professor who happened to have written a book. The instinctfor self-expression is as powerful as the instinct for self-preservation.So Steiner cast out his nets in many directions. He became a regular visitor atthe home of Karl Schröer, the man who introduced him to Geothe's ideas. (Steinersaid that when he sat alone with Schröer, he always felt there was anotherpresent—Goethe.) He made the acquaintance of the brilliant physicist EdmundReitlinger, who was dying of tuberculosis. He discovered Wagner's music, and hadendless discussions with Wagnerians and anti-Wagnerians. He even attendeddebates in the Austrian Chamber of Deputies and the Upper House, and took alively interest in the issue that was undermining the unity of theAustro-Hungarian empire: the demand by minority nationalities—like the Czechsand Hungarians—for greater recognition, and the bitter opposition to thesenationalist movements by German-speaking Austrians. (Steiner was on the side ofthe Germans.) He spent much of his spare time in Vienna's famous coffee houses,particularly the Griensteidl Kaffee on the Michaelerplatz (known as theMegalomania Café), where eventually he became the intimate of various poets andcomposers.It was Schröer who introduced Steiner to the work of a young poetess, threeyears Steiner's junior, called Maria Eugenie delle Grazie, who had achieved adegree of fame with her first volume of poems at the age of seventeen. Steinerwrote an article about her in a small newspaper, as a result of which he madeher acquaintance and became a member of the literary circle that surrounded her.She lived in the house of a Cistercian priest, Laurenz Müllner, so Steiner foundhimself once again exposed to the doctrines of Catholiism. It is interesting tonote that Maria delle Grazie took a thoroughly pessimistic view of the universe;Steiner wrote: ‘To her, the ideals that arise in the human heart are powerlessagainst the cruel, senseless and merciless effect of nature, a nature thatmercilessly cries out to man's idealism: “Thou art but an illusion, a creatureof my own fantasy, which ever and again I hurl back into nothingness.”’ Yetalthough such a view was entirely antipathetic to Steiner, he continued toadmire the poetess.’ I was never inclined to withold my admiration and interestfrom what I considered great, even when I absolutely opposed it.’ And in duecourse, he came to adopt a version of her view that there is a primal satanicforce in the universe.The Müllner-delle Grazie circle detested Goethe and admired Dostoevsky, soSteiner was subjected to an interesting clash of ideals. Schröer, who hadaccompanied Steiner on his first visit to the Müllner household, never wentthere again when he realized how much they were opposed to Goethe. But Steinerenjoyed these conflicts: ‘Delle Grazie's house was dedicated to pessimism; itwas a place of anti-Goetheanism. When I spoke about Goethe, they listened; butLaurenz Müllner thought that what I attributed to Goethe had fundamentally verylittle to do with the actual Minister of the Grand Duke Karl August.’ And thearguments with the Müllner circle enabled Steiner to formulate his own basicinsight. In an article about Maria delle Grazie, he wrote:Our ideals are no longer so shallow that they can be satisfied by theall-too-often superficial and empty external reality. Yet I cannot believe thatno possibility exists to rise above the deep pessimism this insight can bring.And I find the means to rise above it when I look into man's inner world; thatis, when I approach the actual reality of our world of ideas. It is a sphereenclosed and complete in itself…Are not our ideals…realities in their own right,independent of the favours or disfavours of external nature…?He goes on to express an idea that makes it sound as if he was reconciled to hisown poverty and lack of recognition: ‘Where would our divine freedom be ifexternal nature protected us like helpless children, led by the hand? No,external nature must deny us everything so that the happiness we achieve iswholly our own independent creation.’ This stoical and ascetic attitude explainswhy, when he came to encounter the ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, hewas revolted by the notion that a Utopian society is an end in itself.Fortunately for Steiner, fate—aided by Karl Schröer—had offered him a means ofsubsistence. Schröer recommended him as a tutor to the family of Ladislaus andPauline Specht, and Steiner entered their home in July 1884, when he wastwenty-three. They had four children, the youngest of whom, aged ten, wasmentally retarded. Steiner soon formed the conviction that the problem with suchchildren is basically physical: the body, not the soul, is undeveloped. Thismeant that it was a question of trying to draw out the child's mental facultiesby slow and patient effort, the first task being to gain his love. Physicallyspeaking, the child's problem was hydrocephaly—'water on the brain’. Mentallyspeaking, the problem was a certain self-mistrust, the result of his dullnessand slowness when compared to his brothers. Steiner saw it basically as aquestion of giving the child confidence—what modern psychology calls‘motivation’. It meant considerable effort on Steiner's part; for example,spending two hours preparing an hour-long lesson. But he was spectacularlysuccessful. Within two years, Otto Specht had caught up with the primary schoolcurriculum and passed the entrance examination for the Gymnasium. Moreover, thehydrocephalic condition was steadily improving, supporting Steiner's convictionthat the health of the body depends on the health of the mind. Steiner remainedthe boy's tutor for six years, until Otto was sufficiently developed not to needhim. He became a doctor, and was killed when serving in the First World War; hismother, who was deeply attached to him, died soon afterwards.The experience in education brought Steiner insights that were to be of uselater in the Waldorf schools. For Steiner, education meant the development ofthe personality—the ego—not the mere acquisition of knowledge. He was to developthe view that man is a fourfold being, consisting of the physical body, theetheric body (also known as the ‘aura’ or life-field), the astral body (whichcan leave the physical body under certain conditions), and finally, the ego,which orders and co-ordinates the other three. In education, as in health, thesefour elements must be brought into harmony. So, in a child like Otto Specht, thebasic problem was the undeveloped state of the ego, which made it unable toperform its task as ‘conductor’ of the orchestra. Steiner's task, in which hewas totally successful, was to nurture the ego until it grew strong enough totake on its proper role. All this explains why Steiner was so struck by Fichte'semphasis on the importance of the ego, and why it assumed the central role inhis own philosophy.This preoccupation with the importance of the ego also explains why Steiner wasaroused to irritation by the philosophy of Eduard von Hartmann, one of the mostexciting and influential philosophers of the day. Hartmann had become famous atthe age of twenty seven (in 1869) with a book called The Philosophy of theUnconscious . Since Freud, the term ‘unconscious’ has passed into the generalvocabulary; but in the mid-nineteenth century it was still a startling andfascinating concept. Hartmann believed that the force behind the world is a deepunconscious will, which appears in animals in the form of instinct. Hartmann wasopposed to Darwin's mechanical ideas of evolution—that appealed to Steiner—andoffered in its place the idea of an unconscious life force. But, like his masterSchopenhauer, he goes on to reach deeply pessimistic conclusions about humanexistence. In creating consciousness, the unconscious life force made a ghastlymistake, for reason and ‘daylight consciousness’ are profoundly opposed to thegreat irrational force that drives all living things. Man's intelligence hasseparated him from his instincts, so he is in a position to recognize the sheerfutility and meaninglessness of all this instinctive activity. So life isself-defeating; consciousness and the unconscious cancel one another out…It may seem surprising that Steiner was thrown into such a frenzy of oppositionby Hartmann's pessimism, which is not, after all, so different from that ofMaria delle Grazie, which Steiner had been able to accept quite calmly. We mustremember that Hartmann, with his impressive grasp of biology and physics, seemedto be one of the most exciting and up-to-date thinkers of his age, so hisphilosophy was taken far more seriously than the poems and dramas of a younggirl. And Hartmann's view amounted to the belief that life is a ‘tale told by anidiot’, and that evolution is not only going nowhere, but is undermining itself.For Steiner, this raised the most fundamental of all questions: what isconsciousness for ? According to Hartmann, its purpose is simply to give livingcreatures more perception ; it could be compared to the invention of theelectric light. In fact, most of us take such a view for granted. Steiner feltinstinctively that consciousness is an active force, whose purpose is to focusand concentrate on problems. It is not a light so much as a hand that grasps .And the hand that grasps can also build and create. It was Hartmann who helpedto make Steiner aware that his own philosophy was fundamentally opposed to thewhole ‘spirit of the age’. Ten years later, he would give these ideas definitiveexpression in his first major book, The Philosophy of Freedom .In 1883, Schröer had performed another important service for Steiner; he urgedan editor named Joseph Kürschner to allow the twenty-two-year-old Steiner toedit Goethe's scientific writings, and Kürschner agreed. It may seem startlingthat he offered such a task to an unknown student. But we have to bear in mindthat the series in which these writings were published—German NationalLiterature —was one of those immense popular compilations of the late nineteenthcentury, running to 221 volumes; it was a response to the demand of ordinaryhouseholders for readily accessible classics. Presenting Goethe's scientificwritings was a task that few people would have been eager to undertake; therewas a general feeling that they were the absurd aberration of a poet of genius.In effect, Steiner was being tossed a scrap that no one else wanted.Fortunately, Steiner's own basic ideas were in opposition to this negative viewof Goethe. Like Goethe, he felt that nature is ‘God's living garment’, and wasprofoundly opposed to the current tendency to treat it as a world of deadmatter. Steiner himself had no reservations about science; on the contrary, heregarded himself as a scientist. He could enjoy a textbook of physics ormathematics as much as a poetic drama. But he felt that science needed to beredeemed from its materialism.Now Goethe had, in fact, been a very remarkable scientist; his experiments wereprecise and well planned, and the conclusions he drew from them were usuallyaccurate. Long before Darwin, Goethe was an evolutionist. He rejected the widelyheld view that man is in some way totally distinct from all the lower animals.One of the main arguments for this view was that man has no intermaxillary bonein his upper jaw—the bone which, in animals, contains the incisors. Goethestudied skulls and pointed out that man does have such a bone, although it isnow scarcely visible. His conclusions, now totally accepted, were ignored bycontemporary scientists.But for Steiner's contemporaries, the intermaxillary bone was not the stumblingblock. It was not even Goethe's idea about the Urpflanze , the original primevalplant, from which he believed all subsequent plants developed. The realembarrassment was Goethe's immense Theory of Colour , published in 1810, anddescribing the results of twenty years of experiment with light. For thepurposes of this three-volume work was nothing less than to disprove Newton'stheory of light. When he looked at a white door through a prism, Goethe wassurprised to find that, instead of turning into an immense rainbow, it remainedwhite, with rainbow colours only around the edges. Goethe jumped to theconclusion that Newton was mistaken in believing that white light is composed ofthe seven colours of the rainbow. But in that case what causes colour? Goethereplied: the mechanism of the eye. After all, it is the mechanism of the eyethat prevents a colour-blind person from seeing certain colours. Goethe alsoplaced great emphasis on the phenomenon of ‘complementary colours’. If you starefixedly at a bright yellow object, then look away at a wall, a blue after-imagewill appear. Staring at a red object will cause a green after-image. Thisproves, according to Goethe, that the mechanism of colour is in the eye itself.He produced an elaborate theory in which orange is simply a ‘darker’ version ofyellow, and red a darker version of orange, while indigo is a darker version ofblue, and so on. Colour is explained as a function of light and darkness.In a sense, Goethe was simply the victim of a misunderstanding. Newton believedthat light is a stream of particles—tiny hard balls—and Goethe could not imaginewhy white light—a stream of white billiard balls—should actually consist of astream of coloured billiard balls; it seemed illogical. It was easier to believein one-coloured balls, and some mechanism in the eye that colours them.In fact, the Dutch astronomer Huygens had long ago suggested the true solutionto the riddle: that light is not made of particles, but waves. Because ofNewton's prestige, no one took him seriously. In 1803, seven years before Goethepublished his book on colour, the English physicist Thomas Young performedexperiments that showed fairly conclusively that light is made up of waves.Unfortunately, Goethe's independent streak inclined him to believe that all thetheories so far were nonsense.Thirty-two years after Goethe's death, in 1864, James Clerk Maxwell finally putforward the theory that would have provided Goethe with the solution he needed.Maxwell argued that light is simply one of many forms of electromagneticvibration. There are many forms of this energy, ranging from radio waves with awavelength of more than a mile, to gamma radiation with a wavelength of lessthan a thousand millionth of an inch. Our eye is an instrument for detecting anarrow band of radiation whose wavelengths are between sixteen and thirty-twomillionths of an inch—light. It cannot distinguish radiation below that—heat—orabove it—ultraviolet.And how does the eye achieve this miracle of distinguishing between such tinywavelengths? The answer appears to be: by seeing them as ‘colours’. It seeslight of thirty-two millionths of an inch as red, and light of sixteenmillionths as violet. We could say that the eye has ‘invented’ colour. And if,for some evolutionary reason, it became necessary for us to perceive wavelengthsgreater than red or smaller than violet, it would invent new colours that do notat present exist.So Goethe's instinct was correct; the eye does invent colour. But Newton wasalso correct: white light does consist of the seven colours of the rainbow.Steiner could edit Goethe's scientific works with a perfectly clear consciencebecause he felt that Goethe's attitude to reality was fundamentally correct. Heinstinctively rejected the view that the ‘truth’ behind nature is a world ofsound waves and light waves and heat waves: ‘It drove all spirit from theexternal world.’ Neither could he accept the view of pessimists like Maria delleGrazie and Eduard von Hartmann that the meanings we see around us are merelyreflections of our emotions and desires. For Steiner, it was an urgent necessityof life to find intellectual grounds for believing that the world of meaning isa spiritual reality. Goethe provided him with precisely what he was looking for.This is why Goethe became, now and henceforward, the centre of Steiner'sintellectual life. He was the one undoubtedly great man of the nineteenthcentury who was totally untainted by materialism or pessimism. In hisintroductory essays to Goethe's scientific writings (later collected as Goethethe Scientist ) Steiner hurled himself with enthusiasm into his task ofrehabilitating Goethe's vision of nature. And when he had completed theeditorial work, he went on to write his first book, Theory and Knowledge in theLight of Goethe's Weltanschauung , published in 1886.Later in life, Steiner was asked by a disciple why he had kept silent about‘occult matters’ until he was forty. Steiner's reply was that he had to make aposition for himself in the world first, and to acquire the necessary courage.But the impression made upon the reader of these early writings is that occultmatters were still far from his mind; he hoped to overturn nineteenth-centurymaterialism and pessimism with purely intellectual tools. They give theimpression that Steiner regarded himself basically as a philosopher, like vonHartmann, and that he hoped to create a kind of optimistic metaphysics. Thissurely explains his obsessive interest in philosophy during this period of hislife, and why he read Fichte and Hartmann—and later Nietzsche—with suchpassionate interest. It is the view of most of Steiner's followers that he wasbusy laying the foundations of ‘spiritual science’ from the time he came toVienna in 1879, and that he devoted himself to philosophy during his earlierperiod to lay the foundation for his later teachings. It can only be said thatthe writings themselves provide no support for this view. They suggest thatSteiner saw himself simply as a philosopher whose basic task was to makematerialism untenable. In these early years, he seems to have hoped that thesolution lay in the immense prestige attached to Goethe's name. Later, he cameto realize that even Goethe's fame as Germany's greatest writer lent noauthority to his views on science; the scientists could simply declare thatGoethe was no scientist. When Steiner finally reached this conclusion, herealized that his approach needed rethinking. But in 1886, that time still layfar ahead.By the mid-1880s, Steiner's enthusiasm for Goethe had given him the ‘start inlife’ he so badly needed; in Austria and Germany, a man who has edited Goethehas established his intellectual credentials, and can never thereafter bedismissed as a nonentity. He was slowly becoming something of a personality inVienna. He published a few newspaper articles, including the one on Maria delleGrazie which led to their friendship. Physically speaking, Steiner wasunimpressive: a small, thin man with untidy long hair and metal-rimmedspectacles; a friend described him as looking like an undernourished seminarian.Socially speaking, he was comically inept and liable to faux pas ; oneupper-class acquaintance mentioned that he used the intimate du where it wasinappropriate, and that he ‘didn't know a thing’. In the ‘Megalomania Café’ hehad long arguments with a young writer named Hermann Bahr, who claimed to be thefounder of a new literary group called ‘young Vienna’, and who represented inVienna the symbolist and ‘decadent’ ideas that Oscar Wilde represented in Londonor Stéphane Mallarmé in Paris. Steiner's instinct was all against them; but, asyet, he was unable to defend his position intellectually.His circle of friends continued to widen. He became a regular visitor at thehouse of a pastor, Alfred Formey, where literary and musical celebritiesgathered. There he met the widow of the dramatist Hebbel, who gave recitations(presumably from her husband's works), and an actress named Ilma Wilborn, whowas soon inviting Steiner to her own ‘At Homes’—rather livelier than those ofPastor Formey. Like Goethe, Steiner was deeply interested in the theatre as amedium for presenting ideas—an interest that later came to fruition in his fourmystery dramas.Steiner's circle widened further when, in January 1888, he became the editor ofa newspaper, the German Weekly Review ; it appeared simultaneously in Vienna andBerlin, and had a strongly political flavour. Steiner felt obliged to write andthink about politics, although the subject did not come naturally to him. ‘Iwished to introduce something containing an impulse towards the great spiritualgoals of mankind.’ Nowadays, an editor who tried to talk about ‘great spiritualgoals’ in a political newspaper would find himself out of a job; but innineteenth-century Vienna, an idealistic tone was perfectly acceptable. Steinernevertheless found journalism hard going, and was not sorry when, after sixmonths, the owner of the newspaper quarrelled with its founder, and he lost thejob.His work as a newspaper editor led to an acquaintance with the socialist leaderVictor Adler, and many other active socialists. In his usual omnivorous way, hebegan to study the writings of Marx and Engels. Predictably, he found theirmaterialism distasteful:It was impossible for me to find any inner relation to all this. Personally itwas painful for me to hear it said that in human history it is thematerial-economic forces that carry forward man's evolution, while the spiritualis merely an ideal superstructure to this ‘truly real’ foundation. I knew thatthe spirit is a reality. To me, what the theorizing socialists maintained meantclosing one's eyes to the real facts.But even at this stage, at the age of twenty-seven, Steiner had still notformulated his ideas clearly enough to be able to express precisely why herejected dialectical materialism. In spite of his intellectual brilliance, hewas still an awkward, earnest young man who could not formulate his deepestconvictions in words. Steiner was a slow developer; what he needed was somesheltered environment in which he could develop at his own pace.In the following year, 1889, he was offered what he needed. On Schröer'srecommendation, he was asked to present himself at the Goethe-Schiller Archiveat Weimar, to be considered for the task of editing Goethe's scientificmanuscripts for the Archive's complete edition. Steiner had little difficulty inconvincing the director, Bernard Suphan, that he was the right man for the job.It was arranged that he should start in a year's time.On the same trip he visited Martin Luther's room in the Wartburg, as well asspending time in Berlin and Munich. There can be no doubt that this firstjourney into the greater world was of immense importance for Steiner. Hisnatural capacity for floating off into mental worlds meant that every historicalsite and art gallery was a vital imaginative experience. Most of us findhistorical sites a fairly superficial experience; the guide assures us that suchand such an event took place there, and we take his word for it; but we are moreaware of the other tourists and the souvenir shops and the ice cream vans. Allhis life, Steiner had the ability to enter into the spirit of a place, toconjure up the scenes that had taken place in the past. So in front of Goethe'sstatue in Weimar he felt that a ‘life-giving air was being wafted overeverything’, while his visit to the Wartburg impressed him so much that he feltit was one of the most memorable days of his life. In these surroundings,Steiner could sense the birth of a spiritual revolution; it is inconceivablethat he failed to reflect upon his own role as the spiritual successor of Lutherand Goethe.He went to Berlin specially to meet Eduard von Hartmann—further evidence of hisobsession with the ideas of the great ‘philosopher of the unconscious’. Themeeting was a disappointment. Hartmann was an impressive, bearded man, who,because of a knee ailment, spent most of his life sitting on a couch with hislegs outstretched; but he talked with zest and confidence. Clearly, he regardedSteiner merely as a young admirer. ‘He did not really inwardly listen to what Isaid.’ And Steiner, for his part, seems to have over-reacted. He took exceptionto Hartmann's idealist view that all we can know of reality comes from themental pictures it makes on our senses. Steiner replied that he felt we ought toask whether our mental pictures are unreal, only to be told that the very term‘mental pictures’ proves it. ‘I felt inwardly chilled. “Word definition” as aserious point of departure for a view of life!’ This is hardly fair; Hartmann'scomment was perfectly reasonable. Steiner's account of the interview suggeststhat there was no genuine exchange of ideas because he had not yet learned howto formulate his own basic intuitions.Back in Munich for the winter, Steiner became increasingly interested in aphenomenon that had become the latest intellectual fashion: Theosophy, thesystem of ‘esoteric wisdom’ propagated by Madame Blavatsky and her followers.The Theosophical Society had been founded in New York in 1875; ten years later,following an investigation by the Society for Psychical Research, MadameBlavatsky was denounced as a fraud. But her followers remained convinced thatshe had been ‘framed’ by her enemies. And in Vienna, the chief of her followerswas a wealthy dilletante named Friedrich Eckstein, who had met Madame Blavatskyin London in 1884, the year before the denunciation. He had returned to Viennawith the newly published Esoteric Buddhism by A. P. Sinnett, the book that wasto convert the Irish poet W. B. Yeats to Theosophy. Steiner almost certainly metEckstein, who was his own age, in the ‘Megalomania Café’ in 1888. This was theyear that Eckstein and his fellow Theosophists took a castle, the SchlossBellevue, for their summer colony, filling it with all kinds of aesthetes,spiritual aspirants, and students of ritual magic. In this circle it was more orless de rigeur to be a Wagnerian, and in this respect Steiner qualified; he wasalways a lover of music. But Steiner was not equally impressed by EsotericBuddhism ; he read it in its German translation and professed to find itrepellent.Chief among the Vienna Theosophists were the feminist Marie Lang and her husbandDr Edmund Lang. That winter of 1889, Steiner began to visit their home, andlearned more of the doctrines of Theosophy. There was a great deal in it thatappealed to him: for example, its belief that the human soul evolves throughmany incarnations, and that ‘salvation’ is actually a process ofself-realization. Sinnett declares that Theosophy sees no need to keep scienceand religion in separate compartments; physics and spirituality are not onlyreconcilable, but interdependent; this was Steiner's own profound conviction.Theosophy teaches that the spirit evolves through a chain of worlds orplanets—again a doctrine to be found in Steiner's later work. Steiner's accountof the after-death process, with the soul's progress through ‘Kamaloca’ (orpurgatory), is again very close to that to be found in Esoteric Buddhism . AndSteiner, like the Theosophists, accepted the doctrine of reincarnation; heexplains in the Autobiography that it became increasingly obvious to him as hetalked to various people and sensed intuitively that some of their qualitiescould not be explained either in terms of heredity or experience since birth.(For example, he felt that there were qualities in the poet Ferther vonSteinwand that could only have developed at a remote epoch when Greek paganismcoexisted with Christianity.)All this explains why Steiner later became so deeply involved with theTheosophical Society. What is far more difficult to determine is how far his ownideas were derived from Theosophy, and how far he developed them for himself. Hesays of Esoteric Buddhism : ‘I was glad that I had not read it until after I hadattained spiritual perceptions of my own.’ Inevitably, Steiner's hostile criticsregard such statements as attempts to hide the extent to which his own ideas arederived from Madame Blavatsky and Sinnett. And it is certainly difficult topoint to concrete evidence that proves the contrary. Steiner's anti-materialismfirst found expression through his admiration of Goethe. But it also seems clearthat Theosophy exerted a far greater influence than he was willing to admit.It is necessary to make an imaginative effort to understand why Theosophyexercised such a wide appeal. A century after the death of Madame Blavatsky, itseems to be generally agreed that she was a mixture of charlatan and literarygenius, and that works like Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine are Christmaspuddings into which she tossed every possible ingredient from Buddhism to theAtlantis myths. But in the late nineteenth century, there was a deep andpowerful craving for some great religious revival. There was a general feelingthat materialism and agnosticism had gone too far, and that it was time for abackswing of the pendulum. Old-fashioned Victorian Christianity was not likelyto take on a new lease of life; but the natural religious impulses of man werebound to rise up in some new form, and bring mankind back to a perception ofspiritual realities. Once again, religion would triumph over materialism, justas Christianity had triumphed over the paganism of the Romans. There was anintense feeling of expectancy —not so much of some new messiah as of some newmessianic doctrine. This explains what we shall otherwise find very difficult tounderstand: why Steiner's doctrines later spread with such speed across Europe.But before Steiner came along, the major candidate in the ‘new religion’ stakeswas Theosophy. Madame Blavatsky's Isis Unveiled was too long and complex toexercise any wide influence. But Sinnett's Esoteric Buddhism , with its claimsabout hidden wisdom derived from Mahatmas in Tibet, was a literary sensation; itwent through edition after edition. In 1885, the world had not grown cynical, asit was to do a century later. Yeats read the book, handed it to his friendCharles Johnston, and Johnston was so excited that he rushed off to Londonimmediately to get permission to set up a Dublin branch of the TheosophicalSociety. In Vienna, Eckstein was the bearer of the torch. It is important tonote that men like Sinnett, Johnston, and Eckstein were not dubious cranks; theywere regarded as respectable members of society with sound intellectual credit.If they could accept hidden masters in Tibet, so could thousands of otherrespectable middle-class people.Now Steiner was, beyond all doubt, a man who possessed his own spiritual vision;in that basic sense, he was indebted to nobody. From the beginning, heexperienced a powerful sense of ‘the unseen world’. But he was also a natural‘intellectual’, a lover of philosophy and science and mathematics. A young manwith strong intuitions that run counter to the prevailing temper of his age,looks around for allies, for men he can set up as models. Steiner's naturalallies should have been the great mystics of the past, men like Eckhart, Boehme,Swedenborg. But he had no patience with mystics because they were not scientificenough; they insisted that their visions were ‘ineffable’. By the time he hadreached his mid-twenties, Steiner had found only one ‘ally’—Goethe.So the advent of Theosophy was bound to make him thoughtful. It was carrying thedoctrines of spiritual evolution to a far wider audience than Steiner could everreach with his books on Goethe. Eckstein records that Steiner asked him toexplain the doctrines of Theosophy in 1888. We know that Steiner eagerly readEsoteric Buddhism soon after this; he apparently found its doctrine of ‘secretmasters’ a little too ‘materialistic’. But in the following year, he became aregular visitor at the home of Marie Lang, and decided that ‘within herself shehad a store of mystical knowledge which life's hard trials had caused to becomeconscious in a spontaneous way.’ So although Steiner continued to havereservations about Theosophy, particularly in the form in which it was presentedby a rather dishonest ‘occultist’ named Franz Hartmann, he was persuaded byMarie Lang that it deserved taking seriously.All this made Steiner decide that it was time he tried to set out his own‘philosophy of spiritual activity’. He discussed it with a new friend, thefeminist writer Rosa Mayreder (who is remembered nowadays mainly as thelibrettist of Hugo Wolf's opera Der Corregidor ). From what Steiner says abouther in the Autobiography, it seems clear that there was no real intellectualsympathy between them. ‘My attempt to reach conscious experience of thespiritual on the basis of acknowledged science could not possibly appeal toher’; and, again, ‘Nor did Rosa Mayreder find my relation to art in the leastsatisfactory. In her opinion I misunderstood the essence of art…’. That Steinercould nevertheless find her a sympathetic companion, to whom he could pour outthe ideas later embodied in The Philosophy of Freedom , seems to indicate thathe craved an audience. ‘She partly relieved the inner-loneliness I felt.’ Attwenty-eight, Steiner lacked self-assurance. The thin, bespectacled young man,who still looked like a ‘half-nourished seminarian’, was grateful for thesympathy and attention of an older woman, even if she thought most of his viewswere nonsense.In that last year in Vienna, Steiner felt that an epoch of his life was drawingto a close. The future in Weimar looked bright and promising. At this point,Steiner had no suspicion that his seven-year exile in the city of Goethe wouldbe little more than a period of marking time."},{"pageContent":"FourThe Long ApprenticeshipSTEINER was an exceptionally slow developer. It is probably safe to say that ifhe had died before his fortieth birthday, he would now be totally forgotten.Unlike Yeats, whose ‘chosen comrades thought at school He would be a famousman’, Steiner seems to have failed totally to convince any of his early friendsthat he was a potential genius—or if he did, we have no record of it. He was awithdrawn, introverted young man, so inept at expressing his feelings that oneof his closest friends was convinced that he was cold-hearted. The same friendalso considered him a rationalist, because he seemed to spend so much timewrapped up in his own thoughts. In the Autobiography, Steiner himself admitsthat while knowledge of the spiritual world always struck him as self-evident,he had considerable difficulty coming to terms with the real world. He found it‘difficult to relate…to the world of the senses’. A psychiatrist would probablyhave diagnosed him as a mild schizophrenic, schizophrenia meaning a lack ofcontact with reality.In a sense, therefore, the young Rudolf Steiner was a typical figure of the finde siè cle period—a romantic dreamer who never seemed quite at home in thephysical world. Yet in one important respect, he was far more fortunate than somany contemporaries in that ‘tragic generation’. Most of them also feltalienated from physical reality; but their ‘inner lives’ also failed to satisfythem. They felt like dissatisfied strangers, ‘outsiders’, shipwrecked in theworld of actuality. Steiner had no such problem. He may have felt awkward andout of place in the physical world, but he never had the slightest doubt thathis inner world was just as real as external reality. His genuine enthusiasm forideas saved him from falling into the despair that wrecked or destroyed so manyof his contemporaries.In Weimar, that ‘Athens of the north’, to which he moved in the autumn of 1890,he needed all his self-sufficiency. There was, admittedly, a great deal oflively social activity—although never as warm and intimate as in Vienna—andSteiner made many friends. But as a ‘spiritual home’, Weimar was adisappointment. The spirit of Goethe—the feeling that nature is God's livinggarment—was totally absent from the Archive. Men like Bernard Suphan, HermannGrimm, Julius Wahle, Eduard von der Hellen, Reinhold Koehler, were pleasantenough, but Steiner felt that the underlying spirit of the place was pedantic.In a short time he was referring to Weimar as ‘the home of the classicalmummies’, and telling Eckstein (whom he called Eck): ‘You can have no idea howalone I feel here, and how little understood.’ Soon after arriving in Weimar,Steiner gave a lecture entitled ‘Imagination as a Creator of Culture’, in whichhe argued that ‘what man creates in real imagination is in fact a product of thespiritual world’. From what Steiner says of his colleagues in Weimar, we mayinfer that it was received with bemused incomprehension.Yet in another sense, the spiritual isolation was a benefit. In Vienna therewere too many friends, too many cafés, too many distractions. In Weimar, therewas little to do but develop his ideas. Even with friends like Julius Wahle andEduard von der Hellen, Steiner could not speak about his spiritual experiences.He seized the opportunity to work on his Philosophy of Freedom —a book whosetitle suggests it was intended as a counterblast to Hartmann's Philosophy of theUnconscious —and to write a thesis for his doctoral degree.Since he was now a staff member of the Goethe Archive, it was important that heshould acquire some academic qualifications. The problem was that, since he hadnot attended the Gymnasium in Vienna, he was not eligible for a degree. But inGermany, regulations were, oddly enough, less rigid. During his final days inVienna, Steiner had read with enthusiasm a vast work called The Seven Books ofPlatonism by a certain Heinrich von Stein, of the University of Rostock, aBaltic sea port. It excited him because it ‘presented Plato as the great bearerof a philosophy that awaited fulfilment through the Christ impulse’. Perhapsbecause he sensed that von Stein was a sufficiently original thinker torecognize another when he saw one, Steiner decided to send him his thesis: ‘ATheory of Cognition, with special reference to Fichte's scientific teaching’. InMay 1891 he travelled to Rostock to defend his thesis—in those days a part ofthe formal machinery for acquiring a degree. Von Stein proved to be old, serene,and tolerant. He told Steiner: ‘It is obvious that you have not been under theguidance of a professor.’ But he liked the thesis and accepted it.Typically, when the thesis was published the following year, Steiner dedicatedit to Hartmann. Steiner disagreed fundamentally with Hartmann, and—as we haveseen—their encounter in Berlin had failed to bring about any meeting of minds.But Steiner, always modest, still hoped to achieve some degree of mutualunderstanding with his eminent contemporary.The same modesty—amounting almost to lack of self-confidence—seems to explainhis relationship to another influential thinker, the biologist Ernst Haeckel.Like T. H. Huxley, Haeckel had taken up the cudgels on behalf of Darwin at atime when Darwin was being denounced as an infidel. In fact, Darwin was neitheran atheist nor a materialist; Haeckel was both. Like Hartmann, he possessed theability to write highly readable prose, and his Riddle of the Universe became abestseller.The two became acquainted by a misunderstanding. Haeckel called his philosophymonism, meaning that the physical world is the only reality, and that ‘spirit’is a kind of by-product of matter. Steiner also claimed to be a monist, but hetook a diametrically opposite view: that spirit is the only reality, and thatmatter is a by-product of spirit. In February 1893, both Steiner and Haeckelhappened to give lectures on ‘monism’ to a scientific society, and Haeckel sentSteiner a copy of his talk. Steiner reciprocated by sending his own lecture toHaeckel. In the following year, Steiner was invited to the celebrations forHaeckel's sixtieth birthday; he was introduced to the sage, and found him ‘afascinating personality’. Steiner concluded that Haeckel's ‘gentle gaze couldabsorb sense impressions only’, and that he was incapable of real thinking. Hereached the interesting conclusion that in some previous existence Haeckel hadbeen a fanatic ‘related to Church politics’ (i.e. an Inquisitor), and that thistendency combined with his natural gentleness to make him a fanatical opponentof religious dogmatism.Steiner thereafter defended Haeckel in print on a number of occasions—acircumstance that caused bafflement to many of his later followers. It wasobviously impossible that Steiner could have had the slightest intellectualsympathy for a man who declared ‘There is no God, no immortality and no freedomof the human soul.’ And Steiner's rather patronizing remarks about Haeckel inhis Autobiography make his sympathy more puzzling than ever. Steiner's attitudecan only be understood by recognizing what Edouard Schuré later called his‘empathetic and feminine sensibility’. He was a modest man with a gift forfriendship, so he found himself leaning over backwards to defend views that hadnothing in common with his own.Why underline this point? Because the Autobiography, written in his final years,gives the impression of a man whose philosophical and spiritual views werealready fully formed when he came to Vienna at the age of eighteen, and whothereafter marched undeviatingly towards his intellectual goal, without glancingto right or left. But the picture that emerges from comments by hiscontemporaries, and from his own early work, is quite different. They suggest ashy, modest, socially inept but highly ambitious young man, determined to obtaina hearing from his contemporaries, but not sure how to go about it. Hartmann andHaeckel both provided models—not because Steiner agreed with what they had tosay, but because both were immensely successful. And Steiner also, presumably,wished to be successful, an ambition that no one would suspect from the austerepages of the Autobiography.Another case in point is that of Anna Eunicke, the widow Steiner married in1899, and from whom he separated when he met Marie von Sivers. During his firsttwo years in Weimar, Steiner had not been particularly happy with his lodgings.Then he was introduced to the recently widowed Anna Eunicke who, according toone biographer, * [text00008.html#fnr] asked him to supervise the education ofher five children. Steiner moved into her home (he was given his own part of thehouse) and he and the widow became close friends. When he moved to Berlin in1899, the Eunicke family soon followed, and Steiner again became their lodger;then, shortly thereafter, he married Anna Eunicke, who was eight years hissenior.Clearly, Frau Eunicke played an important part in Steiner's life, and one mightexpect him to devote a certain amount of space to her in the Autobiography—atleast as much, say, as he devotes to Maria delle Grazie, Rosa Mayreder, GabrieleReuter, and other female friends. But he is strangely reticent. He tells usthat, through the family of Dr Heinrich Fränkel, a liberal politician, he met‘yet another family’, whose father had recently died. There follows a lengthyanecdote about Steiner's own curious relation with the dead man, of which weshall speak in a moment. After several more pages, Steiner mentions that thename of the dead man was Eunicke. Only then does he devote a few brief lines tothe family in whose house he went to live, mentioning that he and the widowbecame close friends, but omitting any mention of his role as educationaladviser of the children. Finally, at the end of a chapter about his struggles inBerlin, he mentions casually that ‘shortly afterward my friendship with FrauEunicke was consolidated in civil marriage’. Then he adopts a distinctlydefensive tone:Let this suffice in regard to a private relationship. In this account of mylife, it is not my intention to relate private matters, except those that are insome way connected with my spiritual path. And my life with the Eunicke familyafforded me the opportunity of a quiet basis for a life that was both inwardlyand outwardly extremely eventful. For the rest, a person's private life does notbelong to the public. It is of no concern to the public.All this may be conceded; yet once again the reader is left with the vaguelyuncomfortable impression that Steiner the human being has been edited out ofexistence to make room for the more impressive portrait of Steiner the spiritualprophet, standing with folded arms and looking into the distance.But the story of the deceased Herr Eunicke takes us once again to the very heartof the Steiner enigma. In the Autobiography, Steiner claims that he was incontact with Herr Eunicke after his death. Yet the contact was not of the kindwe might expect from a man who had once seen the ghost of a relative in astation waiting room. Steiner explains that when he moved into the Eunickehousehold he became interested in the deceased father through the books in hislibrary. Herr Eunicke had apparently been something of a recluse, and Steinerbecame increasingly intrigued by his personality. Something almost identical hadoccurred eight years previously in Vienna, when Steiner had been introduced tothe family of a fellow student. The father spent most of his time locked up inhis study, and Steiner never even caught a glimpse of him. Yet when the fatherdied, Steiner felt he knew him so intimately that he was asked by the family todeliver the funeral oration.This sounds straightforward enough: Steiner became deeply interested in this manwho had turned his back on the world, asked many questions about him, andgradually came to feel that he knew him intimately. But, as the Eunicke storymakes clear, there was a great deal more than that to it. ‘What I [now] have tosay will be regarded by most people as sheer fantasy. For it will concern theway I was privileged to come into close contact with these two human souls inthat sphere where they found themselves after they had gone through the gate ofdeath.’ And he goes on to remind the reader that ‘I have always approachedspiritual knowledge in the same state of clear consciousness as is necessary forthe pursuit of such exact branches of knowledge as mathematics or analyticalmechanics…’.But when Steiner says he will describe ‘the way’ he came into contact with thetwo dead men, he is speaking loosely. He merely informs us: ‘The powers ofspiritual sight which I then possessed enabled me to enter into a closerelationship with these two souls after their earthly death.’ We are told nomore about the precise means by which he was able to follow their progress afterdeath. Instead, he tells us that although both men were ‘materialists’—as far astheir intellectual approach to life was concerned—they did not act likematerialists (i.e. they were not ruthless or unsympathetic men). The result wasthat ‘the spirit of both men…shone with wonderful light after death’.In a lecture of 1918, ‘The Dead Are With Us’, he is much more forthcoming. Inthis, he emphasizes the similarity between sleep and death. He goes on:Besides waking life and sleeping life there is a third state, even moreimportant for intercourse with the spiritual world…I mean the state connectedwith the act of waking and the act of going to sleep, which last only for briefseconds…If we develop a delicate sensitivity for these moments of waking andgoing to sleep we shall find that they shed great light on the spiritualworld…At the moment of going to sleep the spiritual world approaches us withpower, but we immediately fall asleep, losing consciousness of what has passedthrough the soul.In order to understand all this, says Steiner, it is necessary to grasp a basicfact about the spiritual world.In the spiritual sense, what is ‘past’ has not really vanished, but is stillthere. In physical life men have this conception in regard to space only. If youstand in front of a tree, then go away and look back…the tree has notdisappeared…In the spiritual world the same is true in regard to time . If youexperience something at one moment, it has passed away the next as far asphysical consciousness is concerned; spiritually conceived, it has not passedaway. You can look back at it just as you can look back at the tree. RichardWagner showed that he possessed knowledge of this with the remarkable words:‘Time here becomes space.’In this lecture Steiner certainly shows no reticence about the matter ofintercourse with the dead. (He adds, in parenthesis: ‘The methods of modernspiritualism, of course, must be avoided…’.)We encounter the Dead at the moment of going to sleep and again at the moment ofwaking…As far as physical consciousness is concerned, these are two quitedifferent moments in time; for spiritual consciousness the one is only a littlefurther distant than the other.He goes on to say that the moment of falling asleep is specially favourable forcommunication with the dead. If we wish to ask something, we should ‘carry it inthe soul’ until the moment of sleep, then put the question. The moment of wakingis the best moment for the dead to communicate with us. The question must beimbued with feeling and with will. Then it will be committed to the‘subconscious’, and will be automatically passed on to the dead at the moment offalling asleep.There is another rather confusing piece of information. When we put a questionto the dead, what we say actually comes from the dead person: the answer comesfrom us. The dead inspire the question, so to speak, and the answer comes fromour own soul. This, says Steiner, is the reason why, although we are constantlysurrounded by the dead, we cannot communicate with them—we are unfamiliar withthis curious back-to-front language (which, admittedly, sounds like somethingfrom Alice in Wonderland ). This also explains why, when the dead communicatewith us at the moment of waking, we may be unaware that they are communicating;we simply assume that we thought it. ‘A great deal of what we undertake in lifeis really inspired by the dead,’ says Steiner.What are we to make of all this? The reaction of someone who comes to it for thefirst time is bound to be one of deep scepticism; it sounds as if he has made itup for the consumption of a particularly gullible audience. But anyone who haslooked into these matters more closely will be aware that Steiner's comments areless bizarre than they sound.To begin with, Steiner's method of communication with the dead seems to havemuch in common with that of another eminent ‘spiritual scientist’, EmanuelSwedenborg, who lived two centuries earlier. Swedenborg (1688–1772) also claimedto be able to establish direct contact with the ‘spirit world’, and his methodsalso had nothing in common with those of modern spiritualism. One brief anecdotewill suffice. The queen of Sweden asked Swedenborg to give a message to her deadbrother. Next time he saw her, Swedenborg told her that her brother sent hisgreetings, and apologized for not answering her last letter. He would do so now.Swedenborg then delivered a long and detailed message. The queen turned pale andsaid: ‘No one but God knows this secret.’In his book about Swedenborg, Presence of Other Worlds , the Americanpsychologist Wilson van Dusen advances the interesting hypothesis thatSwedenborg's ‘visions’ of the spirit world were obtained in a ‘controlledhypnogogic state’—a hypnogogic state being the twilight realm between sleepingand waking, or vice versa. The whole book could be regarded as detailed supportfor Steiner's assertion that the secret of communication with the dead lies inthese hypnogogic states. * [text00008.html#fnr1]Another ‘scientist of the invisible’ was the Cambridge don T. C. Lethbridge, whodevoted his retirement to the study of dowsing and similar mysteries of the‘paranormal’. † [text00008.html#fnr2] Lethbridge became convinced that apendulum—a lead bob on a piece of string—will respond accurately to varioussubstances (lead, silver, tin, garlic, oranges, potatoes), swinging over them ina circle when the pendulum is adjusted to the correct ‘rate’ for any particularsubstance. (For example, it responded to tin at 28 inches, alcohol at 26,cherries at 12, apples at 18, and so on.) He further discovered that thependulum also has ‘rates’ for abstract ideas, like love, hate, anger, death, andso on. Everything he tested responded at some length between one and fortyinches. Forty was the ‘rate’ for death. Yet, oddly enough, if he lengthened thependulum over forty inches, all the substances began to register again—at a rateof forty plus their previous rate (so cherries now reacted at 52, apples at 58,and so on).For reasons too complex to explain here, Lethbridge came to the curiousconclusion that when the pendulum was extended beyond forty inches, it wasresponding to the world beyond death—the ‘next world’, so to speak. Lethbridgedid not regard this as some other ‘place’, up in the sky for example. Hebelieved that it interpenetrates our present world, but has a much faster rateof ‘vibration’, so we cannot see it.Through the use of the pendulum, Lethbridge also came to some curiousconclusions about time in this ‘next world’. Time exists there, he concluded,but is completely ‘static’. Time in the next world is a perpetual ‘now’. Hespeculates that this world is a kind of museum, in which all events arepreserved, as in the BBC's sound archives. This sounds very close indeed toSteiner's comments about time in the world after death.That other great teacher of the twentieth century, Gurdjieff, seems to have madeno comment on Steiner and his ‘spiritual science’. But a story told by hisfollower J. G. Bennett makes it clear that Gurdjieff's views on communicationwith the dead were almost identical with Steiner's. In his autobiography,Witness , Bennett tells how deeply he was affected by the death of his mother.One day, Gurdjieff said to Bennett: ‘She is in need of help, because she cannotfind her way by herself. My own mother is already free, and I can help her.Through her your mother can be helped, but you have to bring them into contact.’He gave Bennett a photograph of his own mother, and said: ‘For half an hourevery day you practise what I say. First look well at this picture until you cansee my mother with your eyes shut. Then place two chairs side by side, and onthe right chair picture my mother and on the left your own mother. Stand infront of them and keep your attention fixed upon the wish that they may meet andthat your mother may receive help.’Bennett found the task unexpectedly painful.After a few weeks the effort of standing for half an hour before two emptychairs became almost intolerable. To my surprise I found myself bathed insweat…as if I had been doing heavy manual labour. One day I burst into tears andsobbed for the entire half hour. Yet nothing at all seemed to be happening. Iwas invaded with doubts, and a feeling that the whole affair was a crueljoke…Then a change began. After I had done the exercises for a month, I began tobe aware that there were presences in the room. These presences, which at firstwere fleeting and nebulous, took the shape of my mother and Madame Gurdjieff. Ifelt distinctly that my mother was resisting…Then, one day, the contact wasunmistakable. A wave of relief and gratitude flowed through me. It seemed atthat moment that Gurdjieff was with me… * [text00008.html#fnr3]Steiner's comment that the living are often influenced—at the unconsciouslevel—by the dead can also be found in an early classic of spiritualism, TheSpirits’ Book , by Allan Kardec. Kardec, whose real name was Leon Rivail, was aFrench polymath of the mid-nineteenth century. In the very early days of‘spiritualism’, Kardec heard of a friend whose two daughters could produceautomatic writing at will. The daughters were instructed to ask the ‘spirits’ anumber of questions that were written down by Rivail. Many subsequentinvestigators have found this method highly unsatisfactory, and have ended withlarge quantities of repetitive drivel. Rivail was lucky. The spirits answeredhis questions with detailed precision, and the result was a remarkablephilosophy of the meaning of human life and the relation of the dead and theliving. Rivail's informants told him that the universe is pervaded byincorporeal intelligences. Human beings are simply ‘incarnate’ spirits. Theyadvance towards perfection through the trials and problems of their lives, and,after death, they are reincarnated in another body, and continue their slowevolution. All this corresponds with great precision to Steiner's teaching.Rivail's informants added that the influence of spirits is far greater than mostpeople suppose; they can enter freely into our minds and influence our thoughtsand actions. In extreme cases, this influence amounts to ‘possession’. But suchcases are rare, and the domination always involves a certain degree ofco-operation with the ‘possessed’ person.But perhaps the most important and revealing parallel is with an Americancontemporary of Rudolf Steiner, Thomson Jay Hudson, whose book The Law ofPsychic Phenomena (1893) is one of the great forgotten masterpieces of the latenineteenth century. Hudson, a newspaper editor and official of the PatentOffice, was fascinated by hypnosis, and the extraordinary powers it seems to beable to unleash in otherwise unremarkable individuals. He was also fascinated bysuch anomalies as ‘calculating prodigies’—children who can calculate enormoussums in their heads in a matter of seconds—and men with ‘photographic memories’.These convinced Hudson that the powers of the human mind are far greater thanmost of us realize.Hudson came to the conclusion that man possesses two minds: he called these theobjective and the subjective mind. The objective mind is the part of us thatdeals with everyday life; it looks outward, towards the external world. Thesubjective mind is the part of us that deals with our inner world; it operateslargely through feeling and intuition.Hudson was convinced that hypnosis puts the objective mind—the ‘everyday you’—tosleep, and allows the powers of the subjective mind to operate freely. Normally,they are shy and repressed. When they try to operate under the critical gaze ofthe objective mind, they suffer from a kind of stage fright. But when theobjective mind is put to sleep, the subjective mind becomes capable of the mostremarkable feats. Hudson watched with amazement as a young man under hypnosisproduced the most dazzling philosophical ideas, in the conviction that he washolding a conversation with Socrates.Hudson believed that all so-called psychic powers—telepathy, clairvoyance,healing, precognition—are the perfectly normal powers of the subjective mind. Hedecided to experiment with his own healing powers, directing them towards arelative who suffered from such severe arthritis that he was confined to awheelchair. Hudson decided that the best moment for the use of these powers wason the point of falling asleep at night, or waking up in the morning. Therelative experienced an extraordinary recovery, which began from the time Hudsonbegan this healing ‘treatment’.Steiner possessed the same conviction about man's ‘hidden powers’, and in theAutobiography, quotes with approval a comment by his friend Ludwig Laistner:‘People do not have as much as an inkling of the real significance of thecreative power within the human soul. They do not realize that the creativenessof man is an expression of the same cosmic power that creates in nature.’Hudson is so significant because in the second half of the twentieth century,his theory of the ‘two minds’ has been placed upon a scientific basis byexperiments in ‘split brain’ physiology. It had been known for a long time thatif the corpus callosum—the bridge of nerves connecting the two halves of thebrain—is severed, it can cure epilepsy. What puzzled the surgeons who performedthis operation was that it appeared to make no difference to the patient, whowent on behaving much as usual. An experimenter named Roger Sperry was among thefirst to notice that if a split brain patient banged into a table with the leftside of his body, he did not notice the impact. For some unknown reason, theleft side of the body is controlled by the right side of the brain, and viceversa. Further anomalies began to come to light. One split brain patient triedto hit his wife with his left hand, while the right hand tried to hold it back;another tried to unzip his flies with one hand while the other tried to do themup. It slowly became clear that the ego—the person you call ‘you’—lives in theleft cerebral hemisphere of the brain, while the person who lives in the otherhalf is, relatively speaking, a stranger. A split-brain patient who was shown a‘naughty’ photograph with her right brain (i.e. left visual field) blushed; whenasked why she was blushing, she replied truthfully: ‘I don't know.’ It was thatother person—in the right brain—who was blushing.Why do split-brain patients not realize they have had the operation? Clearly,because in a certain sense, they were split-brain patients before the operation.So are we all. The right brain—the ‘other you’—deals with intuitions, with‘overall meanings’, with patterns; it is the part of us that appreciates musicand poetry. The left brain studies the world through a microscope; it isobsessed with the ‘here and now’. It deals with language, with logic, withcalculation.There are certain moods when the two halves of my brain work so close togetherthat they can actually feel one another's presence. When I am deeply relaxed,when I am in a mood of ‘appreciation’, I seem to relax into the right brain. Inthese states, I become far more intuitive. My memory works better.There is some evidence then, for assuming that the right brain is Hudson's‘subjective mind’, and that the left brain is the ‘objective mind’.The most important observation to arise from all this is that most civilizedhuman beings spend their lives trapped in the left brain, obsessed by the needfor efficiency, for ‘coping’ with the outside world. They can never relax verydeeply; they are rather like a man waiting for the telephone to ring,subconsciously remaining in a state of inner-tension.Artists, poets, mystics, are natural ‘right brainers’. So are all children up tothe age of seven. (It has been established that in children below that age, theleft and right halves of the brain can act interchangeably.) Wordsworth pointedout that as we grow up, ‘shades of the prison house’ begin to close. We losethat ability to retreat into the Garden of Eden of the right brain; the need tocope with the hard world of adulthood keeps us in a state of tension, listeningfor the telephone.All this enables us to understand Steiner's ideas about the ‘spiritual world’with far greater precision. These ideas are certainly the greatest stumblingblock for the average person. We can understand what Steiner means when he saysthat there is an inner ‘soul space’ in all men, and even what he means when hesays that this ‘soul space’ is the setting for spiritual beings and events. Whatwe find quite incomprehensible is how that same soul space is the setting forthe ideas of geometry and philosophy and science. What on earth have these to dowith ‘spiritual beings and events’?But if we think of ‘soul space’ as being Hudson's ‘inner world’, the world ofthe right brain, we can begin to see what Steiner means. When human beings relaxdeeply, they can journey into that inner world. A child deeply absorbed in abook is ‘in’ the soul space. But most of us find it very difficult to venturevery far into the inner world; it is as if we were attached to the objectiveworld—and the objective mind—with a long piece of rope. We can relax to someextent; then we reach the end of the rope and have to stop. When we experiencesome enormous relief, or when someone fascinates us deeply and we become‘absorbed’, we cut the rope and walk deeper into that unknown world inside us.So what Steiner is saying is quite simple. When I become fascinated by a book orby an idea, I retreat into my inner soul space, and this is a valid experienceof that soul space. But if I can cut the rope, and wander far into that innerland—like Blake's ‘mental traveller’—I shall encounter some very strangelandscapes indeed.Moreover, and this is the central point, the more deeply I wander into thatmental land, the more deeply relaxed I become, and the more deeply intuitive .That land of the subjective mind is quite unlike the harsh daylight of theobjective mind; its contours are gentler, softer; its colours are more subtle,its daylight is closer to our twilight. It is at twilight that our intuitionsoften operate most powerfully. And in this land of intuition, we may suddenlyrealize that we ‘know’ all kinds of things that were simply overlooked orignored in the harsh glare of daylight consciousness.Now as soon as we have succeeded in cutting the rope and relaxing deeply intothat mental realm, it becomes perfectly obvious that Steiner was right about onething at least. This is a new kind of experience, not just an intensifiedversion of what we experience when we withdraw behind a newspaper or relax inthe bath. This deeper relaxation gives us a new feeling of freedom , and weexperience new kinds of perceptions. We realize that the ‘rope’ had given us acompletely false idea about this inner world, just as we would have a false ideaabout some land over the border if we had never ventured more than a few hundredyards inside it.Even highly intelligent and perceptive individuals can make this mistake. It isinstructive, for example, to study H. G. Wells's attitude to the problem. In theopening chapter of his Experiment in Autobiography , Wells remarks that he isnot getting enough freedom and peace of mind to get on with his work. He goeson: ‘Entanglement is our common lot. I believe this craving for a release frombothers, from daily demands and urgencies, from responsibilities and temptingdistractions, is shared by an increasing number of people.’He then points out that since life began, most individual creatures have been‘up against it’, absorbed with the mere struggle to stay alive. Now, for thefirst time in history, there is a new type of creature: a human being who wantsto live a mental life. ‘People can ask now what would have been an extraordinaryquestion five hundred years ago. They can say: “Yes, you earn a living, yousupport a family, you love and hate, but—what do you do ?”’Wells compares these ‘new men’ to the earliest amphibians, struggling out ofprehistoric seas to live on the land, seeking to breathe in a new fashion. ‘Atlast it has become for us a case of air or nothing. But the new land has not yetdefinitely emerged from the waters and we swim distressfully in an element wewish to abandon.’ Or, to put it another way, we might say that these amphibiansstill have flippers instead of legs, so half an hour on land tires them out, andthey need to get back to that sustaining element of the sea.Steiner would reply: You are mistaken. We already have legs. The problem issimply that you have forgotten to cut the rope .In order to understand Steiner, we must try to focus on the very heart of thisproblem. We must try to grasp what is wrong with us. Man has evolved by becomingmore efficient. Being efficient involves a certain balance of right and leftbrain. For example, after many years of practice, I am a fairly efficientwriter. I can, for example, read a book from beginning to end in a couple ofdays, then write a review of it. In order to write the review, I have to allowmy right brain to grasp the book as a whole —from a ‘bird's eye view’, so tospeak—and then select certain intuitions, certain insights, and translate theminto words with my left brain. The two must work in concert. And a certaindegree of tension is necessary. If I spend two weeks reading the book in aleisurely way, and write the review in the same expansive frame of mind, I shallprobably write ten times as much as necessary, and have to prune it. On theother hand, if I am in too much of a hurry, my tension will becomeself-defeating and I may miss the whole point of the book. I must establish abalance between these two extremes. If I am a busy man, I may carry this samebalance into most of my daily activities, from driving my car to eating mydinner. It may, in fact, become my ‘normal’ state of consciousness. Sitting inmy armchair after a meal, I may be quite convinced that I am relaxed, while theold tensions continue, a mere inch or so below the surface of consciousness.If I face some appalling crisis, which suddenly disappears, then I breathe adeep sigh of relief, and I really relax. I ‘cut the rope’. And, if I am lucky, Ishall recognize that this new relaxation is a vitally important experience. Itrenews my vitality, strengthens my inner powers. And I shall make it a priorityto try to establish these states of deep relaxation by an act of will.It is, however, far more probable that I shall get a good night's sleep, andsimply forget about the experience. The next day, I shall be back in the oldstate of consciousness, accepting a vaguely uncomfortable state of tension—likea man listening for the telephone—as an acceptable substitute for relaxation.Steiner was one of those lucky people—Wordsworth was another, and Blake yetanother—who are born with the ability to ‘relax into the right brain’. He didnot achieve this ability, as so many of the Romantic poets did, at the expenseof his normal efficiency. In later life, he was capable of a formidable amountof work and concentration. But when it was over, he did not, like the rest ofus, settle into an unsatisfactory state of semi-relaxation. He had explored thatmental world; he knew it existed. He cut the rope, and crossed deep into thatmental land inside himself. And he never ceased to try to explain to his fellowmen: You are mistaken to treat the ‘world of the mind’ as if it were merely ametaphor, or a dim reflection of the physical world. It is another country , andwe all have passports to cross into it.There remains one more question to be cleared up. What does Steiner mean when hesays that intercourse with the dead involves asking the questions they put intoour heads, and receiving their answers from within ourselves? Here again, ourknowledge of the process of deep relaxation provides the answer. When I knowsomeone very well, a kind of telepathic contact is established—so, for example,we may both start to say the same thing at the same time. Who puts it into theother's mind? That is impossible to say. And when I am in a deeply relaxed,deeply intuitive state, I see the answers to questions, just as a calculatingprodigy sees the answer to a mathematical problem. I answer the question myself.Steiner has also remarked on the importance of the sleeping state. In sleep, hesays, we enter the ‘spirit world’—although, since we are unconscious, we knownothing about it. If we could carry consciousness into the world of sleep, wewould be able to explore the spirit world. Unfortunately, consciousness tends toblank out shortly after we have entered that ‘other world’. Perhaps, at somefuture stage of man's evolution, we shall be able to maintain ego-consciousnesswhile we sleep. Meanwhile, our closest acquaintance with that world occurs onthe point of sleeping and waking. Again, what we know of deep relaxationindicates that this makes sense.When Steiner moved into the home of Anna Eunicke, he was (in Dante's phrase) atprecisely ‘the middle of the road of life’. He was thirty-two years old, and hehad thirty-two more years to live. His entry into the Eunicke household has asymbolic importance, for he later emphasized the importance of his contact withthe deceased Herr Eunicke for the writing of The Philosophy of Freedom . Wecould regard The Philosophy of Freedom , published in the following year, 1894,as the beginning of a completely new phase in Steiner's life. It is a consciousattempt to lay the cornerstone for all his future work. Steiner's biographerHemleben says that it ‘embodies, purely in the form of thought, essentiallyeverything that was to be the content of the anthroposophy that Steinerdeveloped later.’Today this book appears less revolutionary than it seemed at the turn of thecentury because other philosophers—Edmund Husserl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, KarlPopper, Michael Polanyi—have carried out Steiner's intention far morethoroughly. That intention, quite simply, is to undermine ‘reductionism’, thattemptingly simple theory that tries to explain the mind in terms of physicalmechanisms.Where Steiner was concerned, the problem went back to that day in Vienna when heaccompanied his friend to the railway station, and the friend maintained thatthought is merely a result of processes in the brain and nervous system. As thetrain pulled out, Steiner shouted: ‘Your very consciousness proves that yourtheory is a lie.’But does it? Not according to the reductionists, one of whom, the psychologistJ. B. Watson, even went so far as to say that he had never observed such a thingas consciousness. What he meant, of course, was that in his laboratory, studyingrats and guinea pigs, he had never observed anything that could not be explainedas a mechanism of the brain and nervous system. And if someone had replied: ‘Butwhat about your consciousness—are you telling me that doesn't exist?’, he wouldhave replied: ‘No, but I am telling you it is a mechanism of the brain andnervous system.’So the central problem is to prove that some psychological process cannot beexplained in terms of mechanisms—that it involves free will.The question is: does it matter? Watson would have said no. But many highlyintelligent men of the nineteenth century would have passionately contradictedthat view, for they knew that reductionism can cause insanity and death. Fichtedescribed his own deep depression when he read Kant and concluded that ‘we canknow nothing’. He escaped the dilemma by recognizing that man does not knowhimself fully until he launches himself into action. (To this, of course, Watsonwould reply: ‘That proves nothing—we all know a car works better when the enginehas had time to warm up.’) The poet Kleist came close to insanity as a result ofreading Kant, and ended by committing suicide. The philosopher William Jamesplunged into a state of profound depression in which he felt permanentlyfrightened and exhausted. He rescued himself by recalling Renouvier's definitionof free will—that I can choose to go on thinking about something, or I candecide to think about something else. That finally convinced James—he could seeno way that the reductionists could get around that particular argument. Herecovered from his nervous breakdown and began to work on his definitivePrinciples of Psychology .All subsequent arguments, by Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Popper and the rest, dependbasically upon this argument about freedom of thought. What they are attemptingto show, basically, is that creative thinking cannot be explained in‘mechanical’ terms, as if the brain is merely a computer. Creativity involveshovering above the subject, like a bird, and seeing many possible choices. Thenthe bird plunges, like a hawk, and seizes one of these possibilities—when itmight just as well seize another. And we are, of course, talking about thedifference between ‘left-brain thinking’ and ‘right-brain thinking’. In order todemonstrate that man possesses genuine freedom of choice, we only have to graspthe way in which he thinks creatively, with the right brain using its ‘bird'seye view’ to perceive a hundred possibilities, and the left deciding which ofthese it will choose.Steiner, of course, knew nothing about the left and right hemispheres of thebrain, or even about Hudson's objective and subjective minds. He goes,nevertheless, straight to the heart of the problem:Materialism can never offer a satisfactory explanation of the world. For everyattempt at an explanation must begin with the formation of thoughts about thephenomena of the world. Materialism thus begins with the thought of matter ormaterial processes. But in doing so it is already confronted by two differentsets of facts: the material world and the thoughts about it.So thought has, in a sense, come out of nowhere—or out of freedom.The sad truth is, of course, that for the thoroughgoing materialist, thisargument would be equally unconvincing. His reply might be somewhat as follows:‘Look at gnats moving on the surface of a pond. Their movements are socomplicated that they seem a proof of freedom of choice. Yet if we knew enoughabout a gnat's brain and about the situation, we would be able to predict everymovement, as we can predict a moth's movement towards a candle flame. Someonewho could look into the interior of the brain would see thoughts and feelingsswarming like gnats; but this does not prove they are ‘free’; a scientist withenough information could predict every one of them…’.This sounds like stalemate, until we return to Renouvier's original definitionof free will as my ability to sustain a thought or change its direction as Ichoose. It is impossible to reduce that to a will-less mechanism.The truth is that Steiner's Philosophy of Freedom would not convert a singlematerialist, or give him a moment's uneasiness. But from Steiner's point ofview, that was unimportant. All that mattered was that, as a ‘scientist’, he hadestablished his own logical foundation . Now if anyone should accuse him ofwishful thinking or irrational optimism, he could point to his book and flatlydeny the charge.To Rosa Mayreder, Steiner wrote: ‘I know the exact place where my book belongsin the current of present day spiritual developments, and can point out theexact spot where it carries Nietzsche's line of thinking further.’ Sadly, noneof Steiner's contemporaries noticed this. Eduard von Hartmann, to whom Steinersent one of the first copies, read it carefully, filled it with notes, and stillfailed to understand a word of it. He sent his copy back to Steiner, evidencethat he had no desire to re-read it, with the bewildering statement that itought to be called Epistemological Phenomenalism and Ethical Individualism .The problem was simple, and it enables us to grasp just why Steiner baffled somany of his contemporaries. Hartmann believed that what we ‘see’ is a kind ofillusion. We might compare this view to the notion that man is trapped insidehis own head, watching pictures of the world outside on a television monitor. Hecan never walk out into the street and see things ‘as they really are’. Hartmannassumed that Steiner started from the same basic premise. But this was untrue.For Steiner, man is already in the street outside. In his autobiography, Steinerexpresses his aim with admirable clarity:I tried to show in my book that nothing unknowable lies behind the sense-world,but that within it is the spiritual world. And I tried to show that man'sidea-world has its existence within that spiritual world. Therefore, the truereality of the sense-world remains hidden from human consciousness only for aslong as man is merely engaged in sense perception.This explains why Hartmann failed to grasp Steiner's meaning. He could see thatSteiner was admitting that reality usually remains hidden from humanconsciousness; but he failed to understand the reason. Steiner goes on to say:‘When to the experience of sense-perception is added the experience of ideas,then consciousness experiences the sense-world in its objective reality.’ Inother words, a dog or cat might fail to grasp the true reality of thesense-world, because they are incapable of handling ideas. But man has theability to stand back from the chaotic reality of the senses, and to see thingsin perspective.Steiner was by no means being muddled or conceited when he compared himself toNietzsche, and claimed to have gone a step further. For Steiner, humanconsciousness is not a mere passive mirror, at the mercy of the bewilderingconfusion of sense-impressions. Man is more like the conductor of an orchestra,in charge of consciousness, and of the sense-impressions. Like Nietzsche'sZarathustra, Steiner felt that man can afford to hold his head high; he isstronger than he thinks. Where Steiner goes beyond Nietzsche is in his clearrecognition that the source of that strength lies in his ‘access to innerworlds’.It was Steiner's tragedy that the sheer originality of that message was farbeyond his contemporaries.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* [text00008.html#fn] Stewart C.

When hebegan to use his faculties of spiritual sight one noticed a certain deliberateadjustment of his being, often accompanied by a lowering of the eyes. Oneremembered then what he says in his books, namely that the physical body of aman must be wiped out before the ‘higher members’ can be perceived.’ *[text00009.html#fnr]In other words, Steiner deliberately withdrew ‘into’ himself, ‘wiping out’ hisperception of the external world. He says elsewhere:When, with spiritual perception, I observed the soul-activity of man: thinking,feeling and willing, a picture of a ‘spiritual man’ became clearly perceptibleto me…I saw these inner manifestations of life as creative forces and theyrevealed to me ‘man as spirit’ within the spirit. If I then looked at thephysical appearance of man, I saw it supplemented through the structure ofspiritual forces, active within the physically perceptible.Steiner adds another interesting clue: that in these moments of spiritualperception, he experienced a flood of warmth . This is important because it isan experience that most of us have shared. Listening to music, reading poetry,kissing a baby, listening to rain pattering on the windows, can all bring thatstrange, exhilarating flood of happiness and warmth. And in the case of afavourite piece of music or a poem, it is not difficult to see how it happens.The music or poem has certain associations , and as we relax and enjoy it, theseassociations come flooding out. This in turn describes the experience describedby Proust: ‘I had ceased to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal…’.Even more significant is the experience of the Hindu saint Ramakrishna. As achild, he was crossing a paddy field when a flock of white cranes flew across ablack storm cloud: the sight struck him as so beautiful that he collapsed in afaint. Undernourishment may, of course, have had something to do with it, butthis does not obscure the central point. Ramakrishna was born with a tendency to‘spirituality’; the beauty of the cranes against the storm cloud brought a floodof ‘associations’, and a sense of ‘access to inner worlds’ that produced asudden and total relaxation—and loss of consciousness. As a young priest,Ramakrishna fell into a state of despair because he had ceased to experiencethese floods of insight; he seized a sword with the intention of killing himselfwhen ‘suddenly the Mother revealed herself to me…The buildings…the temple andall vanished, leaving no trace; instead there was a limitless, infinite shiningocean of consciousness or spirit.’From this time on, any mention of the Divine Mother or of Krishna could sendRamakrishna into this total ecstasy which the Hindus call samadhi . The nameitself was enough to conjure up the flood of associations.Steiner tells no similar story about how he first learned to gain ‘access toinner worlds’, and we may infer that there was no single event, but a greatnumber of experiences of this inner-warmth. Music, for example, played a centralpart. ‘Music became all-important for the kind of spiritual experience I wishedto establish on a secure foundation within myself.’ So did poetry, particularlythat of Goethe and Schiller. So at a fairly early stage, by his mid- orlate-teens, Steiner had acquired the same basic knack as Ramakrishna: of beingable to retreat into himself and cause an instantaneous flood of inner warmth.The career of the Silesian mystic Jacob Boehme affords another clue. Hisbiographer records that, when Boehme was twenty-five (in 1600), his eyes fell ona pewter dish whose dark surface reflected the sunlight. Like Ramakrishna, hewent into ecstasy, and experienced the sensation that he was looking into theheart of nature. He went out into the fields, and felt as though he could seeinto the trees and grass, as if they were made of glass and lit from within.Steiner's own account of ‘spiritual vision’, while more down-to-earth in tone,reveals that he is speaking about the same thing:While in earthly life man develops from birth onward, he confronts the worldwith his power of cognition. First he gains insight into the physical sphere.However, this is but the outpost of knowledge. This insight does not yet revealeverything the world contains. The world has an inner living reality [myitalics] but man does not reach this living reality at first. He shuts himselfoff from it. He forms a picture of the world which lacks inner reality becausehis own inner reality has not yet faced the world. The world-picture he formsis, in fact, an illusion. As man perceives the world through his senses he seesan illusion. But when, from his own inner being, he adds sense-free thinking tosense perception, the illusion is permeated with reality; it ceases to beillusion. Then the human spirit experiences itself within man and meets thespirit in the world; the latter is no longer hidden from man behind the physicalworld; it weaves and moves within it .The last phrase—italicized by Steiner—makes it clear that the experience he isdescribing is identical with Boehme's vision of the ‘signature of all things’(by ‘signature’ Boehme meant the inner reality). Steiner is asserting that onceman has learned to create that curious glow of inner warmth and to retreat intoit , the world ceases to be an ‘illusion’, and becomes a spiritual reality,permeated with its own vital spirit.Most of us can grasp what he means. Every nature poet has described thesensation: the feeling that the earth is alive with meaning. We experience itourselves on a spring morning, when everything seems to glow with a new life.But we are inclined to dismiss this as a ‘manner of speaking’. We feel that ourown sense of warmth and excitement is conferring warmth and excitement onnature. Steiner is denying this view, and stating that what we see in thesemoods is closer to the reality than what we see in ordinary perception.What emerges very clearly is that Steiner's attitude is fundamentally romantic,as romantic as Keats, or Shelley, or Hoffmann. This is nowhere more apparentthan in his next major work, Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom . Steinerhad come across Nietzsche's writings in Vienna in 1889, and had becomeincreasingly fascinated by his ideas. This in itself is difficult to understand,since it would be hard to find two thinkers with less in common than Steiner andNietzsche. Steiner was convinced of the existence of a spiritual world thatsomehow runs parallel with this one; Nietzsche was convinced that the only worldis the one we live in, and that people refuse to face this reality because theyare too weak. According to Nietzsche, if people had more strength, more courage,more willpower, they would glory in the existence of ‘this world’, and recognizethat all ‘other worlds’ are delusions conjured up by weakness and neurosis. Thisconviction was not the result of intellectual analysis, but of a number ofexperiences of overpowering ecstasy, moments in which Nietzsche was swept awayby a Dionysian flood of strength and optimism; it was after one such moment, ona Swiss mountainside, that Nietzsche conceived the idea of Zarathustra, andwrote on a slip of paper ‘Six thousand feet above men and time’. It seems a fairassumption that Nietzsche would have dismissed Steiner as what he liked to callan ‘other-worlder’.Steiner, for his part, admits that he was at first repelled by Nietzsche and byhis self-assertiveness: ‘I loved his style, I loved his daring, but I did notlove the way he spoke of the most significant matters without entering intothem.’ But then, Nietzsche was a visionary who was convinced that he had seenthe truth about human existence. That truth is that man is slowly evolvingtowards the Superman, and that the sooner he recognizes this and directs all hisefforts towards it, the sooner he will forget the religious fairy stories thatkeep him weak and deluded.The rather more dubious side of Nietzsche's ‘evolutionism’ is his glorificationof the warrior—particularly when, as an exemplification of the warrior-hero, hechooses an archetypal ‘spoilt brat’ like Cesare Borgia. Nietzsche's own physicalweakness and consequent inability to escape the atmosphere of the study leadshim to take a rather unrealistic view of the man of action.Then how could Steiner bring himself to admire Nietzsche? The answer can befound in the Autobiography:I felt him to be a personality who was compelled by disposition and education tolive intensely in the cultural and spiritual life around him, but who also felt:‘What has all this to do with me?—so much repels me. There must be a differentworld, a world where I can live.’ This made him a fiery critic of his time, buta critic made ill by his own criticism.This view seemed to be confirmed when Steiner met Nietzsche. The philosopher'ssister, Frau Elizabeth Förster-Nietzsche, came to the Goethe Archive to askadvice about founding a similar Nietzsche archive—her brother had been insanesince 1889—and took a liking to Steiner. He was invited to her home, and that ofNietzsche's mother, in Naumburg. On the first visit, he was taken in to seeNietzsche. ‘He was lying on a couch. His exceptionally beautiful forehead wasthat of a thinker and artist. It was early afternoon. His eyes, though dying,still reflected his soul; they took in his physical surroundings, but this nolonger reached his mind. One stood there, but Nietzsche was not aware of one'spresence. Observing his intelligent features one could believe they belonged tosomeone who had spent all morning engaged in thought and now wished to restawhile.’Steiner now experienced another of his ‘spiritual insights’:The inner shock I experienced led to what I can only describe as an insight intothe genius of Nietzsche whose gaze, though directed towards me, did not meetmine. The very passivity of this gaze, resting upon me for a long time, releasedmy inner comprehension…In inner perception I saw Nietzsche's soul as if hoveringover his head, infinitely beautiful in its spirit-light, surrendered to thespiritual worlds it had longed for so much but had been unable to find beforeillness had clouded his mind…Previously I had read Nietzsche. Now I saw theactual bearer of ideas from the highest spirit realms, ideas that even hereshone in their beauty despite having lost their original radiance on the way. Asoul who had brought from former lives on earth golden riches of greatspirituality but was unable to let it shine fully in the present life. I admiredwhat Nietzsche had written; now I saw his radiant spirit behind what I sogreatly admired.In fact, what Steiner saw in Nietzsche was largely a reflection of himself. Hefelt of his own age: ‘What has all this to do with me? There must be a differentworld, a world where I can live.’ Nietzsche had conceived his own philosophy ofDionysian strength in his student days, after taking shelter from a storm in ahut where a shepherd was killing a goat; the crash of the storm mingled with thebleating of the goat and the smell of blood, and brought an overpowering ecstasywhich expressed itself in the words: ‘Lightning and tempest are differentworlds, free powers without morality. Pure will, without the troubles andconfusions of intellect—how happy, how free!’All this is a long way from the romantic, world-rejecting Nietzsche that Steiner‘saw’ that day in Naumburg, with his ‘golden riches of great spirituality’ (aphrase that would have made Nietzsche wince). In spite of which, the bookSteiner wrote on Nietzsche—and published in 1895—is remarkably perceptive. Itreveals Steiner's extraordinary power of empathy—at times, the style even soundslike Nietzsche. And the reason is that, in spite of their many differences,there is a certain basic kinship between Nietzsche and Steiner. To grasp thiskinship is of central importance in understanding the essence of Steiner'sthought. It can be found in a passage in his earlier book On the Theory ofKnowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception . There * [text00009.html#fnr1]Steiner attacks the view that the world of thought is dim and unreal compared tothe world of sensations:The truth is entirely overlooked that mere ‘beholding’ is the emptiest thingimaginable, and that it receives content only from thinking…When one who has arich mental life sees a thousand things which are nothing to the mentally poor,this shows as clearly as sunlight that the content of reality is only thereflection of the content of our minds, and that we receive from outside merelythe empty forms. Of course, we must possess the inner power to recognizeourselves as the creator of this content….Here we could say that Steiner has already grasped the essence of Nietzsche'sZarathustra, four years before he came across Nietzsche's writings. This is evenmore clear in the penultimate chapter of the book, which deals with Optimism andPessimism. Here Steiner states: ‘Man is the central point of the worldorder…Things really are only as they are illuminated by him. This point of viewdeclares that man possesses within himself the central essence of his ownexistence. It makes him a self-sufficient being…’. And he goes on to dismissoptimism, which says the world is basically good, and pessimism, which says itis bad. ‘The external world is, in itself, neither good nor bad; it only becomesone or the other through man.’This is why, in spite of basic differences of approach, Steiner could write sosympathetically about Nietzsche. Like Nietzsche, his fundamental message is thatman is far stronger than he realizes. The mind itself transforms reality, as thesun transforms the world when it rises in the morning. As Blake said: ‘The foolsees not the same tree that the wise man sees.’But we should also bear in mind that the book in which Steiner made theseassertions is about the ‘theory of knowledge implicit in Goethe's worldconception’. He is not speaking in his own person, as Rudolf Steiner, but as akind of mouthpiece for Goethe. In the book on Nietzsche, he is speaking asmouthpiece for Nietzsche. At this point, in his mid-thirties, he has still notacquired the courage to express his convictions in his own voice. And in fact,his next major work—published two years after the Nietzsche book—was yet anotherstudy of Goethe, Goethe's Weltanschauung .Oddly enough, this final—and most definitive—work on Goethe was written as aresult of Steiner's friendship with a circle of Nietzsche enthusiasts, the vonCromptons, one of Weimar's most prominent families. Steiner's book on Nietzschemade him a welcome visitor. The von Crompton circle was outspokenly critical ofWeimar, which they found ‘human, all too human’. They wanted to know how Germanculture could develop when Weimar, the home of Goethe, made so little effort tofulfil its mission.Goethe's Weltanschauung differs from Steiner's earlier books in its sense ofintellectual passion; at last, he is daring to raise his voice, and speak with awarmth that must have made his fellow Goethe scholars raise their eyebrows. Thereason, he explains in the Autobiography, is that he was strongly under theinfluence of the von Crompton circle, particularly their discussions about thenature of human personality. But he had already grasped this important matter inthe earlier book on Goethe. There, after declaring that the ‘content of realityis only the reflection of the content of our own minds’, he went on: ‘Of course,we must possess the inner power to recognize ourselves as the creator of thiscontent; otherwise we shall forever see only the reflection, and never our ownmind which is reflected. Indeed, one who perceives himself in an ordinary mirrormust know himself as a personality in order to recognize himself as thereflected image.’ (He might have added that very few animals recognizethemselves in mirrors.) All of which is to say that until I dare to recognizemyself fully as an individual personality, I shall never understand thatunconscious creativity which transforms the world around me. Now Steiner wasallowing that realization to overcome his natural modesty—and his caution as ascholar—so that the Goethe book rings with a new depth of personal conviction.There is, of course, irony in the fact that he still has to take refuge behindGoethe. But Steiner himself was intelligent enough to grasp that irony. He wasslowly becoming aware that, whether he liked it or not, he would soon have tostand before his audience as Rudolf Steiner, and dare to use the word ‘I’.It was at this period, when he was writing the final Goethe book, that ‘aprofound transformation began to take place in my inner life’. The chrysalis wasslowly turning into a butterfly. What happened was that Steiner ceased to feelthe need to shrink away from the real world and take refuge in his mental world.It was a kind of rebirth.I became able to observe physical things and events more accurately andcompletely than before. This was the case in regard to scientific investigation,and also to external life in general…There awakened within me a new awareness ofsense-perceptible things. Details became important. I felt that the sense worldhas something to reveal which it alone can reveal. I felt one ought to learn toknow the physical world purely through itself without adding any of one's ownthoughts.These remarks sound oddly commonplace for such a climactic change. We have tobear in mind Steiner's admission that he always had great difficulty coming toterms with the real world, as if his sense organs were somehow too weak to makeproper contact. For modern readers, that sentence ‘I felt that the sense worldhas something to reveal which it alone can reveal’ may bring to mind AldousHuxley's description of his experience under mescalin: that sense that the worldhas suddenly become fifty times as real , and that the sheer ‘is-ness’ of thingsis speaking to us. Our senses filter the real world, and ‘turn it down’ like thevolume control on a radio; mescalin removes the filter and turn up the volume.This seems to be what Steiner is trying to describe. And his sentence aboutlearning ‘to know the physical world purely through itself without adding one'sown thoughts’ brings to mind Nietzsche's triumphant cry: ‘Pure will, without thetroubles and perplexities of intellect! How happy! how free!’What was happening was that Steiner was slowly ceasing to be the shy, shrinking,self-conscious young man, of whom Friedrich Eckstein said ‘He didn't know athing.’ It had taken him a long time to grow up. During the first half of hislife he had been a typical ‘outsider’ figure, withdrawn into a world of his ownthoughts, looking at the real world as if he was looking through the glass of anaquarium. Now, at last, he was in contact with the real world, and felt no moreneed to retreat hastily back into the safety of his mental world.‘I was aware that I was experiencing an inner transformation of soul-life whichnormally occurs at a much earlier age.’ And he came to the interestingconclusion that for most people, it happens too early. They emerge from the shy,inner world of the child and adolescent, and learn to come to terms with thereal world around them. The result is that the two worlds mix, like hot and coldwater, the result being lukewarm water. Because Steiner had taken so much longerto make contact with the external world, he had also acquired the knack ofpreventing the two from diluting one another.It had happened at exactly the right time. Steiner's work in Weimar was drawingto a close; he had completed his edition of Goethe's scientific writings. Andwhile no doubt he could have stayed on at the Goethe Archive indefinitely, hewas experiencing the need to move on. The desire to express his convictions wasbecoming increasingly strong. ‘My special concern at this period of my life wasthat ideas which I had to reject emphatically had taken such an intense holdupon thinking in general. These ideas were so universally accepted that peoplewere unable to see the possibilities inherent in anything that opposed them.’And Steiner had to face the fact that his own books were doing nothing to changethe opinions of the age. His highly abstract style guaranteed that very fewpeople read them. Sooner or later, he would have to go out into the world andpreach. But where would he begin? ‘Thus at every turn I met the problem: How canI find the way to express in terms understandable to my contemporaries what Iinwardly perceive directly as truth?’ And it is significant that the followingchapter of his Autobiography—Chapter 24—is the only one that bears a title:‘Must I remain silent?’Steiner's thoroughly unpractical solution to the problem was to purchase amoribund magazine called The Review of Literature . It was unpractical, to beginwith, because the magazine had only a few subscribers. A Frank Harris or a G. K.Chesterton might have turned it into a success; but Steiner was the last man inthe world to improve its circulation. His brief editorship of the German WeeklyReview in 1888 had shown that he had no talent in this direction. Worse still,the owner would only sell it if Steiner accepted as co-editor a pleasant butlazy man-about-town called Otto Erich Hartleben, an ‘aesthete’ who spent halfhis time in Italy and the other half in Berlin cafés. Steiner liked him—he seemsto have liked everybody—but found it impossible to work with him.Nevertheless, the magazine seemed to offer the only solution to the problem ofhow to reach a wider audience. So in July 1897, Steiner finally severed hisconnection with Weimar and became an editor in Berlin.The change was not particularly pleasant. Once again, he found himself living inuncomfortable lodgings. The people he now associated with were friends ofHartleben and members of a group called the Independent Literary Society whoregarded the magazine as their own platform. Steiner says mildly: ‘Those whowere connected with the Review …were not particularly serious-minded people.Only a very few had any deeper interests.’ And it does not take a great deal ofreading between the lines to see that they regarded Steiner as what wouldnowadays be called a ‘nut’. With charming honesty, Steiner admits that Weimarfriends had failed to understand his ideas, but had been willing to accept thathe had something of value to contribute. This new circle, he says with obviousunderstatement, did not share that impression. So his first experience ofattempting to reach the wider public must have been something of adisillusionment.Steiner, fortunately, was not the kind of man to be discouraged byincomprehension. His ‘spiritual insight’ suggested that all this was ‘theworking of destiny’, a healthy-minded attitude that protected him from thediscouragement he would have certainly experienced as a younger man.His permanent lack of money did nothing to ease the situation. The magazinestaggered on from crisis to crisis, and caused endless anxiety. Steiner's ownreviews and articles, far from increasing its circulation, alienated manysubscribers, particularly a group associated with the University of Berlin. Onceagain, he was spending his time sitting around in cafés with impecuniouswriters, just as if the last ten years had never happened. Some of thewriters—like the dramatist Frank Wedekind—were men of genius; but they still hadnothing whatever in common with Steiner. ‘My position became uncomfortablewithin this circle because I realized why I was there, but the others did not.’And why was he there? To fulfil his destiny, to speak openly of his knowledge ofthe spirit. It was a pity that no one seemed interested.At least he was able to renew his acquaintance with the theatre. The magazinewas also associated with an independent Drama Society’, who hired theatres formatinée performances of uncommercial plays—such as Maeterlinck's symbolist dramaThe Intruder . Steiner introduced this play with a short lecture, and thoroughlyenjoyed himself. Whether his audience did is another matter: ‘it affordedopportunity to convey a mood of true spirituality’. Cultivated Berliners foundSteiner's brand of spirituality incomprehensible. In this age of Freud andIbsen, Strindberg and Wedekind, H. G. Wells and Bernard Shaw, his ‘idealism’must have struck most of them as a stale leftover from the 1850s.Not the least of his personal problems was the ‘utter misery of living alone’.At least this improved when Anna Eunicke moved from Weimar to Berlin in 1898;she took a house in the suburb of Friedenau, and invited Steiner to become alodger. But the daughters were now grown up, and the presence of this stillfairly young man in a house full of women probably gave rise to gossip. Forwhatever reason, Steiner and Anna Eunicke were married on 31 October 1899.For the short period it lasted, Steiner's marriage seems to have been a happyone. An interesting glimpse into his domestic life can be found in the memoirwritten by a working man named Alwin Rudolph, who called upon Steiner towardsthe end of 1898 as an emissary of the College of the Workers’ EducationalAssociation. The College was looking around for someone to undertake thethankless task of lecturing on history—the lectures were usually so dry thatmost of the students dropped out after a week or so, and the lecturers becamediscouraged. Someone suggested a certain poet, and the poet suggested Steiner.So a delegation led by Herr Rudolph called upon Steiner at the house inFriedenau.They were shown into a large room with an enormous desk by a young woman—one ofthe daughters. There was an older woman in the room, as well as Rudolf Steiner,a small, slim man dressed in black, with an untrimmed moustache and a flowingbow tie. Steiner was friendly and welcoming, and in no time at all, pastries hadbeen produced and a coffee grinder was at work on the table. Of the women,Rudolph says: ‘Actually I ought not to speak of them as “ladies”, because theywere two simple women, open-minded and many sided.’ Presumably he means to saythat they did not strike him as at all ‘upper class’—if anything, the reverse.They seemed to treat Steiner with reverence, and it never occurred to Rudolphthat the older woman might be—or might become—Mrs Steiner.Without hesitation, Steiner agreed to give the course of lectures. The workingmen were so overwhelmed by all the hospitality and friendliness that they evenforgot to mention the question of money—the fee for the course was a mere eightmarks. Accordingly, Rudolph was ordered to return and find out whether DrSteiner would be insulted by such a small sum. His reception this time was evenfriendlier; Steiner greeted him by taking both hands. Once more, coffee wasproduced, and when Steiner told him it was heated by spirits, there was acertain amount of joking about the word. The daughter produced a rag doll of DrSteiner, and lifted the black frock coat to reveal a bottle of brandy. The girlexplained that ‘his whole body is spirit’. Rudolph, a Marxian materialist, was alittle bewildered by these jokes, but deeply impressed by Steiner—so much sothat he again omitted to mention fees.On 13 January 1899, Steiner arrived for his first lecture at two minutes toeight—it was due to begin at eight—once more accompanied by his two faithfulfemales. The room was small, for the College was accustomed to the audiencedwindling steadily during the ten-week course. The little man with the friendlyface and Austrian accent lauched himself into the lecture, speaking withoutnotes, and the crowded audience was deeply impressed. Some of them even saidafterwards that he ought to be a Member of Parliament.The situation was, of course, paradoxical. The Workers’ Educational Associationwas founded on Marxian principles, so its view of history was totallymaterialistic. Steiner was not in the least bothered by this; in fact, he saw itas his task to convert them to his own views in the gentlest possible manner. Wemay regard his attitude as either pragmatic or Machiavellian. He says: ‘It mustbe remembered that there are partial truths in the materialistic ideas oneconomics…Had I simply ignored them and taught history from an idealistic pointof view, the workers would have sensed that what I said was not in agreementwith the partial truths they knew…’. In other words, Steiner allowed them toassume that he agreed with Marx's economic theory of history. But he immediatelyadded a reservation. It was nonsense to speak of economic forces dominatinghistory before the sixteenth century, because economic life did not take on aform that could be understood in a Marxian sense until that time. Any goodMarxist would have told him indignantly that the sixteenth century was the ageof mercantile capitalism, and was just as dominated by class conflict as thenineteenth century. Fortunately, Steiner's audience consisted of respectfulworkers who were overawed by his enormous erudition. So they raised noobjections when Steiner explained that before the sixteenth century, the greathuman ideals were spiritual, and that only in recent centuries have these becomeweakened by materialism. Probably no one even guessed that Steiner was not anorthodox Marxist. ‘It would have been useless to enter into a controversy aboutmaterialism; I had to let idealism arise out of materialism,’ says Steinercunningly.Fortunately, he adds, the leaders of the workers were not in the leastinterested in the College, so he had a free hand. Besides, no one could affordto look a gift horse in the mouth; Steiner charged only eight marks, and hislectures remained crowded throughout the course. Soon, other workers wanted himto come and address them. Trade unions asked him to lecture on science:Haeckel's Riddle of the Universe was the current bestseller, and discussing thiswas a delicate task, since it was a passionate attack on all forms of religion.(Steiner solved this problem by telling his audience that only the biologicalpart of the book was valid, and the rest ought to be destroyed.) For theGutenberg anniversary, he was asked to address an audience of seven thousand inthe Berlin circus.But if Steiner was quite happy to consort with the enemy, the enemy was lessbroad-minded. Sooner or later, the leaders of the working-class movement inBerlin were bound to realize that they were nurturing a viper in their bosom.One of them attended a lecture, and declared ‘In the proletarian movement we donot want freedom—we want reasonable compulsion.’ But Steiner's pupils remainedloyal. His audience in the rented rooms in the Annenstrasse swelled from fiftyor so to over two hundred; instead of lasting until eleven o'clock, his lecturesusually went on until after midnight. And Steiner was in his element. At last hewas addressing the ‘masses’, and discovering that, in spite of his somewhatabstract mode of expression, he was a charismatic orator. It took the leaders ofthe Berlin socialist movement another four years to dislodge him; and by thattime, Steiner had moved on to an even more appreciative audience.What excited Steiner's listeners so much was that they were asked toparticipate. The German method of teaching tends to be authoritarian; theaudience listens quietly, then goes home. Steiner's friendly manner made it easyfor his audience to ask questions and join in the discussion. The lesson helearned became the basis for Steiner's later educational theory. Nowadays wetake it for granted that audiences join in the discussion after a lecture andthat the aim of education is to encourage the student to develop hisindividuality. It is almost impossible to grasp how revolutionary these ideasseemed in Berlin in the last year of the nineteenth century.Steiner was involved with other groups and societies beside the Workers’College. One of these was called ‘die Kommenden’, the Future Ones, and itscentral figure was the Jewish writer and social thinker Ludwig Jacobowski, whoran a magazine called Society and devoted his life to combating anti-semitism.In fact, Steiner went on to lecture to the Jacobowski group after his openinglecture at the Workers’ College. When Jacobowski died of meningitis in 1900, atthe age of thirty-two, Steiner gave his funeral oration.Another group with whom Steiner soon became involved was the Giordano BrunoUnion, a group of ‘monistic idealists’—i.e. people who believe that the onlybasic reality is spirit. Steiner attended the opening lecture, given by hisfriend Bruno Wille in 1900 and demonstrated that, in the social sphere, he wasstill prone to ineptness. Wille lectured on Goethe's remark that there is nomatter without spirit. Afterwards, Steiner commented that Goethe hadsupplemented these words with the important amplification that ‘polarity andintensification are direct manifestations of the spirit at work in creation’.Understandably, Wille saw this as a form of one-upmanship—as Steiner would haverealized if he had thought twice before speaking. But the friendship survived,and Steiner was later asked to teach history at a newly created IndependentCollege launched by Wille and other ‘Brunoites’.Philosophically speaking, Steiner's friends—and critics—must have wonderedwhether he was coming or going. In Jacobowski's Society he published a spiriteddefence of Haeckel, whose Riddle of the Universe he had dismissed so cavalierly.In his Review , Steiner published articles by an anarchist friend, the Scot JohnHenry Mackay, who preached a non-violent social revolution. He was influenced byhis liking for Mackay and the fact that Mackay had been best man at hismarriage; but respectable readers of the Review were outraged that it should beturned into a platform for anarchism, and cancelled their subscriptions by thedozen. (The magazine was also banned in Russia.) Steiner's lectures at theWorkers’ College lent credibility to the view that he was a disguisedfellow-traveller. Yet he infuriated the members of the Giordano Bruno Union witha lecture on ‘monism’ in which he praised Scholasticism, pointing out thatthinkers like Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas were monists in the sense that theybelieved that the universe is basically spiritual in nature. His audience foundit impossible to understand why Steiner should speak sympathetically of theChurch that had burned Giordano Bruno, and suspected that he was trying tosmuggle in Catholicism by the back door.In spite of these controversies—and the steady decline of the magazine—Steiner'sreputation was spreading by word of mouth. In 1900, a young member of the Berlinlodge of the Theosophical Society approached two of its leading members, Countand Countess Brockdorff, and suggested that Rudolf Steiner would be a suitableperson to deliver a lecture on Nietzsche. He had been excited by a curiousarticle Steiner had written about Goethe's ‘Fairy Tale’, which Steinerinterpreted as an ‘esoteric’ parable about the supersensible world. On 22 August1900 Steiner delivered a lecture on Nietzsche in the library of the BerlinTheosophical Society. It went down well. Steiner had forgotten about Theosophysince his brief flirtation with it in Vienna in the 1880s, although he had madesome hostile comments about it in his magazine. Now he noticed that some peoplein the audience were ‘people who had great interest in the world of spirit’. Hewas asked to come again. On 29 September 1900, he lectured on the ‘secretrevelation’ of Goethe's ‘Fairy Tale’. It was, in a sense, a historic occasion,for this was the first time that Steiner had ever spoken out publicly about his‘spiritual researches’.The Theosophists asked for more. Steiner obliged with talks on two mystics,Meister Eckhart and Jacob Boehme, and followed them up with another twenty-threelectures on various aspects of mysticism and the inner life. One member of hisaudience told him one day that his ideas were not in accordance with those ofAnnie Besant, leader of the English branch of the Theosophical Society. Steinerreplied mildly: ‘Is that so?’, and went on as before.But most of the members, including Count and Countess Brockdorff, were lesscritical. They sensed that Steiner was speaking from some direct personalknowledge, and they were intrigued. So, apparently, was a rather attractiveyoung woman who began to appear at the lectures—Marie von Sivers, who had beenbrought up in Russia, studied drama at Paris, and only recently had decidedagainst making a career as an actress. She approached Steiner and asked himwhether it was not time to launch a new spiritual movement in Europe. Steineragreed that it was, and sensing—correctly—that she was asking whether he waswilling to lead such a movement, replied that he would only be available to‘call into life’ a movement linked to Western occultism. He meant, of course,that he was not interested in developing Madame Blavatsky's Eastern form oftheosophy.According to the biographer of Marie von Sivers, * [text00009.html#fnr2] it wasthis conversation that brought Steiner to a decision. ‘After the decisivequestion had been put…it became possible for Rudolf Steiner to approach histask, to become a spiritual leader of mankind.’The meeting with Marie von Sivers marked the end of Steiner's marriage—althoughhe and Anna were to live together until 1903—and the beginning of his career asa public personality.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* [text00009.html#fn] Rudolf Steiner Enters My Life , p. 71.* [text00009.html#fn1] Chapter XI.* [text00009.html#fn2] Marie Steiner-von Sivers , by Marie Savitch."},{"pageContent":"SixOccultist and GuruTHE rise of the Steiner movement in Europe between 1900 and 1910 was one of themost remarkable cultural phenomena of our time. It raises certain basicquestions that must be examined before we proceed any further.James Webb put the problem in a nutshell when he wrote: ‘[Steiner's] transitionfrom liberal academic to mystical lecturer is at first sight baffling.’ He goeson to explain that Steiner's work on Goethe had prepared the ground for histheosophical convictions. We have already seen that this is untrue; the gapbetween the Goethe scholar and the author of Cosmic Memory is so vast as to beunbridgeable in normal intellectual terms.Steiner's enemies had an uncharitable but plausible explanation: that Steinerseized the opportunity presented to him by a gullible group of Theosophists tocreate a new ‘religion’ that would appeal to his contemporaries. Steiner'sfollowers reply that, on the contrary, his convictions all sprang from innerexperience, and that most of them had already formed before he became aTheosophist. Let us try to study both sides of the argument impartially.The anti-Steiner case runs as follows. Before he began lecturing to theTheosophists, Steiner was known as a liberal academic who was opposed to thetotal materialism of Haeckel. Yet his views were so confused that he wrote abook defending Haeckel. In these same years—towards the turn of the century—hemade many hostile remarks about Christianity. Yet by the autumn of 1901 he waslecturing to the Theosophists on ‘Christianity as Mystical Fact’, and apparentlyaccepting Madame Blavatsky's cosmology of the ‘seven root races’ and theexistence of Atlantis and Lemuria. As time went by, Steiner expanded his view ofChristianity until it became the central event in human history; as a result heacquired a large following of Protestant clergymen. Towards the end of his life,he had actually created his own branch of the Protestant Church, the ‘ChristianCommunity’.It must be admitted that there is a certain amount of supporting evidence forthe ‘opportunist’ view. In the Autobiography, Steiner states that ‘a consciousknowledge of true Christianity’ began to dawn in him in the Berlin period, andthat it grew deeper towards the turn of the century, culminating in a revelationwhen he stood ‘in the spiritual presence of the Mystery of Golgotha in a mostprofound and solemn festival of knowledge’. According to the later Steiner, the‘Christ event’ was the central event in human history. What happened, he said,was that a divine being, who had been preparing for incarnation since thebeginning of human evolution, descended to earth in the last three years of thelife of the historical Jesus and took over his body. His purpose was to turn thetide of battle against the forces of materialism (aided by ‘evil’ powers calledAhriman and Lucifer), which would otherwise have overwhelmed humankind. Furthercomplications are added to this story by the fact that, according to Steiner,there were actually two historical Jesuses, one a descendant of kings and areincarnation of the Persian prophet Zarathustra, and the other a ‘simpleton’who had never before been reincarnated as a human being. They lived together inNazareth at the same time. But the ‘Zarathustra Jesus’ died, and his mother tookover the upbringing of the other Jesus. All this, according to Steiner, explainswhy there is such a discrepancy between the early chapters of the Gospels ofMatthew and Luke: they were talking of two different Jesuses…None of this, however, is to be found in the series of lectures Steinerdelivered to the Theosophists in the winter of 1901–2, Christianity as MysticalFact . Most of the book is devoted to an exposition of the ‘ancient Mysteries’,those secret rites and doctrines that contained the essence of the oldreligions. Those who were admitted to these secrets were the Initiates. Theinitiate knew that God ‘slumbers’ in nature. But the initiate knows that God isalso to be found in his own soul, and that ‘the soul is a sacred place where thespellbound god may wake to liberty’. The Father is the spellbound god, asleep innature; the Son is the awakened God, born out of the human soul. All of this is,of course, perfectly in accordance with the doctrines Steiner has alreadyenunciated in his books on Goethe and Nietzsche: man must awaken his hiddenpowers.The lectures continued with a section on the Greek sages before Plato, themysticism of Plato, the neo-Platonists, the Mystery wisdom of Egypt, andfinally, Jesus as a representative of the Mystery religions, an Initiate.There was nothing here that was likely to offend a Theosophist—after all, MadameBlavatsky had stated that all religions are different approaches to Truth, andthat there is no religion higher than Truth. In fact, what Steiner had to say inChristianity as Mystical Fact bears a remarkable resemblance to a work that hadbeen published in 1889, The Great Initiates by Edouard Schuré. Schuré, twentyyears Steiner's senior, was a French dramatist and critic who, like Steiner,detested scientific materialism. The Great Initiates —an immediatebestseller—began with the sentence: ‘The greatest evil of our time is the factthat science and religion appear as two hostile forces that cannot be reconciledwith one another.’ It goes on to speak about esoteric teaching: ‘All greatreligions have an exterior and an interior history, one open to all, the othersecret.’ This secret religion, ‘once seen, shines out, luminous and organic,always in harmony with itself. It might also be called the history of eternal,of universal religion.’ And in the remainder of this large book, he sets out toshow that various religious figures of the past—Rama, Krishna, Hermes, Moses,Orpheus, Pythagoras, Plato, and Jesus—were all ‘great Initiates’ of this one,universal religion. Much is made, of course, of Jesus's initiation into themystery sect of the Essenes, and the ‘esoteric instruction’ he received. ‘We arebeginning to understand that Jesus at the very height of his consciousness, thetransfigured Christ, is opening his loving arms to his brothers, the otherMessiahs who preceded him, beams of the Living Word as he was, that he isopening them wide to Science in its entirety, Art in its divinity, and Life inits completeness.’Marie von Sivers had been deeply influenced by Schuré, and became histranslator. So it seems conceivable that it was she who introduced Steiner toThe Great Initiates , and who was responsible for the view of ‘Jesus theInitiate’ that we find in Christianity as Mystical Fact .In the Autobiography, Steiner defends himself against many of these criticismsand, if we can accept his basic premises, it must be admitted that his argumentsare convincing. Steiner insisted that when a man has developed the power towithdraw ‘inside himself’—through Imagination, Inspiration, and Intuition—hebecomes aware of spiritual realities, and that these include the life history ofthe human race. He develops the power to read the ‘Akashic records’, theimperishable record of the past that is imprinted on the psychic ether. MadameBlavatsky also had this power, but she only achieved it in trance, when the‘hidden Masters’ spoke through her. The result was that much of what she recordsin Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine was only partly true. Steiner was ableto perceive the ‘spirit world’ in full consciousness, and he insisted that hisown revelations about the remote past were as accurate as he could make them.In writing about Steiner's description of the ‘etheric body’, Anne Bancroftcomments: ‘It is here that we begin to pull back a little, if we are honest. Fornobody except a clairvoyant has actually seen an etheric body.’ *[text00010.html#fnr] This is true; but then, there is a great deal of evidencefor the existence of the etheric body or ‘life field’, not only in the testimonyof hundreds of clairvoyants, but in the work of scientists like Harold Burr, whoestablished the existence of this electrical ‘life field’ by attaching delicatevoltmeters to living creatures.† [text00010.html#fnr1] We may choose to beintellectually convinced by such evidence, even if we have never actually seen a‘life field’. The same is true of the power of ‘psychometry’ (which I havediscussed in Chapter 1 [text00005.html#page_9] .) There is extremely convincingevidence that certain people can ‘read’ the history of objects which they holdin their hands. Most of these people actually ‘see’ these past events, as iflooking at a mental cinema screen.Dowsing as we have seen, is another baffling faculty that eludes scientificexplanation, although it has been extensively studied by science. A good dowsercan ‘tune in’ to whatever he happens to be looking for, and ignore other things.He can, for example, locate copper coins hidden under a carpet, and ignoresilver ones; then, a moment later, he can locate the silver coins and ignore thecopper ones. It is as if some curious faculty of the mind could be brought intooperation at will. There is a certain amount of evidence that this faculty maybe connected with the right cerebral hemisphere.So no one who has considered the overwhelming evidence for ‘extra-sensoryperception’ will dismiss Steiner's claims out of hand. Moreover, no reader ofthe Autobiography or The Philosophy of Freedom is likely to conclude thatSteiner was an intellectual charlatan. He makes an impression of rigidintellectual honesty.This leaves us with a problem which looks in rational terms, basicallyinsoluble. It would be simple if we could dismiss Steiner as an opportunist whoadopted Theosophy because it offered him a platform, and deliberately formulatedhis views about Atlantis and the Christ Revelation as a mythology to satisfy theneeds of his followers. But this would involve the assumption that the Dr Jekyllof The Philosophy of Freedom turned into the Mr Hyde of Cosmic Memory and AnOutline of Occult Science , and this seems, to put it mildly, unlikely.It might be more constructive to ask: does it really matter? And the answer is:probably not. An interesting parallel case is that of Gurdjieff, whose complexcosmology involves a hierarchy of ‘higher worlds’, and the belief that men are‘food for the moon’. But it is possible to regard Gurdjieff as one of thegreatest teachers of the twentieth century without paying the slightestattention to his cosmology. The essence of Gurdjieff's teaching lies in hisstatement that men are victims of a form of mechanicalness which he calls‘sleep’, and that with sufficient effort, we can wake up. In short, we may feelthat Gurdjieff's greatest significance lies in his psychology, not hiscosmology.The same is certainly true for Rudolf Steiner. The essence of his thought liesin the recognition that human freedom plays an active part in perception(although we usually fail to notice this, except in rare ‘orgasmic’experiences). Once this is recognized, says Steiner, it is possible to developthis ‘faculty of freedom’ by deliberate effort. The result, he says, is‘knowledge of higher worlds’. He insists that this knowledge involves glimpsesof mental horizons that are at present inconceivable to us. The knowledge hedetails in Cosmic Memory brings most of us to what Renée Haynes has called ‘theboggle threshold’ fairly quickly. But deciding to reject it—or simply to regardit as ‘unproven’—does not necessarily entail rejecting more ‘testable’ aspectsof Steiner's philosophy. One of Steiner's leading commentators, Stewart Easton,remarks about Steiner's ‘Christology’: ‘I had the overwhelming impression thateven if much that Steiner had to say on other subjects might be mistaken orerroneous, he simply could not have been mistaken on the cosmic nature ofChrist…’. What is interesting here is the admission that Steiner might oftenhave been mistaken or erroneous. Steiner himself insists repeatedly that he doesnot wish to be taken on faith; everything he says should be tested. Presumably,therefore, he himself would recommend us to reject—or regard asunproven—anything that pushes us over the ‘boggle threshold’.How is it conceivable that Steiner could be mistaken or in error about varioussubjects? He himself provided the answer in recognizing the affinity between‘inner visions’ and dreams. To ‘relax into the right brain’ is, to some extent,to enter a world of strange impressions and glimpses: that is, of intuitions.One of the greatest of Steiner's fellow visionaries, Emanuel Swedenborg, wasundoubtedly a genuine clairvoyant; yet in one of his books he has detaileddescriptions of the inhabitants of the planets that we now know to be absurd.William Denton's book The Soul of Things * [text00010.html#fnr2] has manyextraordinary ‘psychometric’ descriptions of Rome and Pompeii that have beenproved to be accurate; but he also devotes a volume to descriptions of theplanets that are as nonsensical as Swedenborg's. In this curious world of ‘innervision’, there are no hard and fast rules for distinguishing between reality andfantasy. So where Steiner is concerned, we may accept whatever strikes us asdemonstrably true, and reject the rest with a good conscience.Before speaking of Steiner's cosmology, let us glance briefly at that of MadameBlavatsky, so we can observe their points of similarity. Madame Blavatsky'shistory of the human race is set out in The Secret Doctrine , which is largely acommentary on an ancient work that she calls The Book of Dzyan. (It is writtenin ‘Senzar’, the ancient language of the Initiates.) According to the Book ofDzyan, there was orginally a great nothingness, the night of Brahm, which endedwhen the vibrations of eternity announced the cosmic dawn. These vibrationssplit into seven rays, who became intelligent beings, Dhyan Chohans, whoproceeded to create the universe from electricity. (Since the electron was notdiscovered until after her death, this was a fairly good guess.) The process ofcreation begins with diffused cosmic matter, then a fiery whirlwind, which leadsto the creation of a vast nebula, or cloud of cosmic gas.The earth, which condenses out of this gas, is destined to pass through sevenperiods, or Rounds; we are now in the fourth. During the first three Rounds, theearth was nonmaterial; it hardened into matter only in the fourth Round.The human race originated on earth hundreds of millions of years ago. It willalso go through seven cycles (or root races): we are the fifth of these. Thefirst race was purely spiritual in form, and inhabited an ‘Imperishable SacredLand’ at some unstated location. The second race were Hyperboreans, who lived ata North Pole which was then a tropical region. These were also ‘bodiless’.Procreation slowly developed towards the end of the second race, and continuedinto the third. It was in the midst of this third race period, about eighteenmillion years ago, that certain spiritual beings felt a longing to experienceearthly existence, and descended to the physical plane; this was the ‘Fall’.They possessed only three senses, hearing, touch, and sight. This race lived ina vast continent called Lemuria, in the Pacific Ocean. (Australia is a fragmentof Lemuria; so is Easter Island.) Lemuria was destroyed by fire, and vanishedinto the ocean.The fourth race were the Atlanteans, who lived on the fabulous continent in themidst of the Atlantic Ocean. In some respects, they were more highly developedthan we are, and understood how to use electricity; they also invented poweredflight. The early Atlanteans were giants, and were responsible for building thepyramids and structures like Stonehenge. But they misused their power and becameblack magicians, and their continent was finally destroyed in a waterycataclysm.Our own root race is the fifth, and it began in northern Asia. Like all theother root races, it is divided into seven sub-races, and we are the fifth ofthese. The sixth is already beginning to form. Where matter is concerned, ourrace is the most ‘solid’ so far. This means that we are more ‘entrapped’ thanany previous race. At the same time, we also have more possibilities of creativeaction than any previous race, just as a sculptor can work better in clay thanin soft mud, and better in marble than in sandstone. In due course, we shall bereplaced by a more etherialized sixth root race, and then by an almost purelyspiritualized seventh…The obvious objection to Madame Blavatsky's chronology is that it does not agreewith that of modern archaeology and geology. In The Secret Doctrine she loses noopportunity of pointing out that science is still ignorant of many things. ‘Asregards the duration of the geological periods alone, the learned men of theRoyal Society are all hopelessly at sea…’. But since the invention of carbondating, we are in an altogether better position to state that the Great Pyramidwas built a mere 2,500 years ago, not 75,000 years ago, and that the same goesfor Stonehenge. The same techniques enable us to be reasonably certain about thehistory of mankind, and to state with a fair degree of certainty that a hundredthousand years ago (the date of some of the late Atlantean catastrophes) modernman (Cro-magnon) had not yet appeared upon the scene of history. It is true thatthere are still large areas of doubt—an American professor of history, CharlesHapgood, believes that ‘maps of the ancient sea kings’ suggest that there was ahighly advanced civilization covering much of the globe in eight thousand BC,two thousand years before the first cities are supposed to have been built. Buteven this lends no support to Madame Blavatsky's vast epochs of ancient history.From his earliest association with the Theosophical Society, Steiner insistedthat he would never be willing to toe the party line; everything he taught wouldbe drawn from his own direct knowledge and personal experience. The Theosophistsaccepted this, and in 1902 Steiner became secretary general of the Germansection with the approval of Annie Besant, who had succeeded Madame Blavatsky.None of the books Steiner published in the first three years of his associationwith Theosophy are in any way contradictory of the views of Madame Blavatsky.Mystics of the Dawn of the Modern Age (the lectures on Eckhart, Boehme, etc),From Buddha to Christ, Christianity as Mystical Fact , and Theosophy were allperfectly acceptable to English as well as German Theosophists—in fact, the bookon mystics was an immediate success and when Steiner visited London in 1903 aleading Theosophist told him that ‘it contained the truth about Theosophy’.In 1904, Steiner began to publish in the magazine he had started, Lucifer-Gnosis, chapters of a work called From the Akashic Records (translated as CosmicMemory ). And it is here, for the first time, that he attempts to go furtherthan Madame Blavatsky, and contradicts her on many points. By comparing thiswith The Secret Doctrine we can see how far Steiner's cosmology diverged fromthat of Madame Blavatsky.Steiner agrees with Madame Blavatsky that the earth had three previous‘incarnations’, and he calls these (rather confusingly) Old Saturn, Old Sun, andOld Moon. Old Saturn was made of ‘chaotic, undifferentiated substance’, and wasinhabited by creatures who were ‘delicate, tenuous and ethereal’, and who wouldlater become human beings. Higher beings than man—whom Steiner calls‘hierarchies’—were in charge of this evolutionary process. It was through theirinteraction with the natural forces of Old Saturn that physical organs began toemerge. Man's physical body began to form in the Saturnian stage of evolution.Then came a gap in time, when the ‘seed’ of man lay fallow, and the spiritualhierarchies built up their powers to further his evolution. The next earth—‘OldSun’—came into being. There was a still further ‘hardening’ of matter, and manacquired his second body, the ‘etheric body’ (or what we have referred to as the‘life field’). Man had reached the plant stage of evolution.On the next earth—‘Old Moon’—man was endowed with the ‘astral body’—the part ofus that leaves the physical body during sleep, and in so-called ‘out-of-the-bodyexperiences’.When man was finally reborn on our present earth, his body was still little morethan a cloud of vapour. Here again, Steiner is fairly close to Madame Blavatsky.During its first two epochs, the human race remained ‘ethereal’. The third epochwas the age of the Lemurians. These creatures communicated by telepathy, and hadan intuitive understanding of plant and mineral life. A Lemurian could increasethe strength of his arms at will, and lift enormous loads by using his willpower. His intuition also placed him in direct contact with divine wisdom. TheLemurian women began to develop powers of imagination, and because this led themto enjoy certain things and dislike others, the first ideas of good and evilarose. It was during this Lemurian epoch that the moon split off from the earth,in order to give man a better chance to evolve—the ‘moon forces’ were causingman to ‘condense’ too quickly. (Moon rock brought back to earth from the firstmoon landing seems to suggest that Steiner was mistaken about this: scientistsnow believe that the moon was never a part of our earth, but was probably‘captured’ from space.)As he continues to ‘harden’, man becomes subject to certain evil or hostileforces, known as the Luciferic hierarchies. This is a point that requires someexplanation. According to Steiner, it was the Divine intention that man shouldhave free will. So—for some unexplained reason—the ‘hierarchies’ were first ofall given a chance to exercise free will, and thus to rebel against God. Twodifferent types of spiritual being took advantage of their freedom to rebelagainst the divine will; these Steiner refers to as the Luciferic and Ahrimanicbeings. (These are called—for short—Lucifer and Ahriman.) Lucifer tempts man topride, while Ahriman tries to push him to advance much faster than he should—forexample, by scientific invention. Man is continually surrounded by these ‘badangels’, who seize every opportunity to influence him.Fear, illness, and death enter human history during the Lemurian period, due tothe influence of the Luciferic beings. Man also develops a taste for rebellionthrough their influence. The result was an upsurge of egoism that led to atremendous catastrophe, which put an end to Lemuria.In the next epoch—Atlantis—man becomes more ‘solid’ still. These descendants ofthe Lemurians were unable to reason, but they possessed an abnormally powerfulmemory. They could control the life force in plants and use it as modern manuses coal. But Ahriman pushed them into merely scientific achievement, and evenInitiates among them gradually became corrupt. Various sub-races hardened intoegoism and power-seeking. Man became increasingly a slave of matter. Evil beganto spread, and ‘since the forces of growth and generation, if torn from theiroriginal sphere and used independently, have a mysterious connection withcertain forces working in air and water, there were thus unchained, throughhuman action, mighty destructive natural forces which led to the gradual ruin ofAtlantean territory…’. Atlantis vanished as recently as 10,000 years ago,according to Steiner.Our own age, the fifth epoch, is the post-Atlantean era. We are the fifthsub-race of this epoch. The first sub-race was Hindu, and their era began in7227 BC . But they regarded the material world as illusion—'maya’—and so merelyturned their backs on it. The second sub-race, the Persians, began in 5067 BCand ended in 2907; they regarded life as a crude battle between the forces ofgood and evil—Ahriman and Ahura Mazda. Next came the Egypto-Chaldeans, whodiscovered astrology, and who came altogether closer to accepting matter. Theirage ended in 747 BC , the date of the founding of Rome. The Romans went furtherthan any human beings so far in accepting the material world as the onlyreality—they even worshipped their emperors as gods. At this point in hisevolution, man came close to being overwhelmed and permanently defeated by evilforces. And it was at this point that the ‘hierarchy’ called Christ descendedinto the body of Jesus of Nazareth—in the last three years of his life—andturned the tide of battle. Christ had been around since the beginning, and hadbeen active on behalf of evolving humanity. By the time our earth was created,Christ had become the highest of the sun spirits, and the chief opponent ofLucifer. He realized that, at some point, he would have to enter a human body tofinally set limits to the powers of Lucifer and Ahriman. His purpose was tolaunch a new stage of evolution, in which man finally established a consciousego, an ‘I’, which could make its own choices, and whose evolution would bepurely in its own hands. Steiner called this ‘I’ the ‘intellectual soul’. Theage of the intellectual soul came to an end in AD 1413, and was replaced by theage of the ‘consciousness soul’, in which we are still living. The consciousnesssoul has greater powers of objectivity than any previous soul; it can withdrawitself totally from the object of its studies. The age of the consciousness soulis also the age of the ‘loner’, the ‘outsider’; in the previous age, humanbeings were far more conscious of being members of a group than of beingindividuals. The characteristic ‘Mysteries’ of this new age were those of theRosicrucians, and Steiner seems to associate these with that widespreadobsession of the Middle Ages, alchemy. ‘Man prepared himself for his experimentsas if for a sacred rite,’ he says in Mystery Knowledge and Mystery Centres . Yetthis experimental spirit in itself gradually led to our ‘God estranged’civilization. According to Steiner, the zeitgeist (‘spirit of the age’) is areal entity, a guiding spirit whose purpose is to guide evolution in aparticular epoch. During the ‘Rosicrucian’ epoch, this spirit of the age was theArchangel Gabriel, whose business was to lead the human spirit into materialism,to foster a healthy spirit of scepticism and experimentalism. In 1879 (the yearSteiner went to Vienna), Gabriel gave way to the Archangel Michael, whoseevolutionary task (as summarized by Stewart Easton) is ‘to bring men together asindividuals, so that they recognize their common humanity and Christ who liveswithin each human being’. Meanwhile, Steiner sees his own task as theinauguration of this new age: what has been lost through the descent intomaterialism can only be replaced by the new Mystery knowledge that he has givento mankind. Man must regain his perception of nature as ‘God's living garment’.So Steiner sees himself as an important port of the world historical process.And there can be little doubt that when, in 1902, he became general secretary ofthe Theosophical Society, he hoped that he might succeed where Madame Blavatskyhad failed, and create a new religion, a great spiritual movement that wouldfinally rescue man from the consequence of materialism. The fountainhead of thisnew religion would be a Mystery centre, at the heart of which there would be asacred temple….For the reader who is approaching Steiner for the first time, the last few pagesmust have raised many doubts. It is surely inconceivable—to put it bluntly—thathe could have believed this preposterous rigmarole about Old Saturn and Lemuriaand Atlantis?It is reassuring to discover that Steiner was himself fully aware of theseobjections. He speaks of them in one of the lectures in Karmic Relationships(Vol. 6, No. 8), quoting the Belgian writer Maurice Maeterlinck. In The GreatSecret , Maeterlinck says of Steiner: ‘When he does not lose himself invisions—plausible, perhaps, but incapable of verification—of the prehistoricages, and in the astral jargon concerning life on other planets, [he] is a clearand shrewd thinker…’. And he goes on:Steiner has applied his intuitive methods, which amount to a kind oftranscendental psychometry, in order to reconstruct the history of theAtlanteans and to reveal to us what takes place on the sun, the moon and inother worlds. He describes the successive transformations of the entities whichbecome men, and he does so with such assurance that we ask ourselves, havingfollowed him with interest through the introductions which reveal an extremelywell-balanced, logical and comprehensive mind, if he has suddenly gone mad or weare dealing with a hoaxer or with a genuine seer.Maeterlinck's expression of the conundrum could hardly be improved. Steiner is aclear and shrewd thinker, and his insights are often profound. He is certainlyno fake in the intellectual sense—no second-rate mind utteringpseudo-profundities. And it is quite plain that he has not gone mad. Is itconceivable that he is a kind of hoaxer—that is, that he has set outdeliberately to create a religion for the twentieth century, and has recognizedthat such a religion needs a mythology, which he sets out to provide?This explanation, which seems the most rational explanation of works like CosmicMemory , becomes rather less convincing as one reads Steiner's later works,written (or delivered as lectures) long after he had broken with theTheosophical Society. Karmic Relationships , a series of lectures delivered in1924, runs to over a thousand pages, and it is only necessary to read the firstdozen to realize that he is perfectly sincere. Besides, no man would elaborate alie or a hoax at such length.Was he, then, a genuine seer? That he was a seer there can be no doubt whatever.But does this mean that his ‘visions’ were invariably true? Here, unfortunately,the answer has to be negative. On Sunday 16 August 1924, Steiner visited ‘KingArthur's Castle’ at Tintagel, in Cornwall. It deeply impressed him, and in alecture the following Friday in Torquay, he spoke at some length about the‘spiritual perceptions’ he had gained as he gazed down from the ruins across thesea. ‘From the accounts contained in historical documents’, he explained to hisaudience,it will not be easy to form a true conception of the tasks and the mission ofKing Arthur and his Round Table…But this becomes possible when one stands on theactual site of the castle and gazes with the eye of the spirit over the stretchof sea…There, in a comparatively short space of time, one can perceive awonderful interplay between the light and the air, but also between theelemental spirits living in light and air. One can see spirit-beings streamingto the earth in the rays of the Sun, one can see them mirrored in the glitteringraindrops, one can see that which comes under the sway of earthly gravityappearing in the air as the denser spirit-beings of the air. Again, when therain ceases, and the rays of the Sun stream through the clear air, one perceivesthe elemental spirits intermingling in quite a different way. There onewitnesses how the sun works in earthly substance—and seeing it all from a placesuch as this, one is filled with a kind of pagan ‘piety’—not Christian but paganpiety, which is something altogether different. Pagan piety is a surrender ofheart and feeling to the manifold spiritual beings working in the processes ofnature.One can see that Steiner was greatly moved as he stood among the ruins whereArnold Bax had earlier written his famous tone poem Tintagel . He goes on toexplain that to ‘take hold of the spirit-forces working there’ at Tintagel wouldhave been beyond the power of one man; a group of men was necessary, one of whomfelt himself to be the representative of the Sun (which, in Steiner, is alwaysassociated with Christ).It was here that King Arthur and his Twelve Knights drew into themselves fromthe Sun the strength wherewith to set forth on their mighty expeditions throughEurope in order to battle with the wild, demonic powers of old, still dominatinglarge masses of the population, and drive them out of men. Under the guidance ofArthur these men were battling for outer civilization.He continues at some length, explaining that ‘the whole configuration of thiscastle at Tintagel indicates that the Twelve under the direction of King Arthurwere essentially a Michael-community…’.In fact, archaeological evidence has revealed that in the time of King Arthur,the only building on the present site of Tintagel Castle was a Celtic monastery.The castle was built six hundred years later, around AD 1140, probably byReginald, Earl of Cornwall, a bastard son of King Henry the First (who was, inturn, the son of William the Conqueror).‘King’ Arthur was, in fact, a Roman general named Artorius, protégé of acommander called Ambrosius. When the Romans left England, about AD 410, Saxonmercenaries began to push back the original inhabitants—the Celts—towards thewest and north. Arthur (probably born about AD 470) was the commander whodefeated the Saxons again and again, and finally turned the tide in the battleof Badon, about AD 515. Unfortunately, the Celts, who had united magnificentlyagainst the Saxon invader, began to squabble amongst themselves, and Arthurspent the rest of his life trying to avoid being stabbed in the back by his ownallies and relatives. He was mortally wounded in the battle of Camlann, around540, fighting against his own nephew, and his body was almost certainly buriedin Glastonbury Abbey, where it was discovered in May 1154 by monks digging agrave.There can be very little doubt that Arthur never left England. His exploits as aconqueror of Norway and Gaul were invented by a Welsh ecclesiastic calledGeoffrey of Monmouth in his History of the Kings of Britain , which dates fromabout 1135. According to Geoffrey, Arthur was marching on Rome when he wasrecalled to England by the rebellion of his nephew Mordred. In Geoffrey'saccount, King Arthur was born in Tintagel castle after the magician Merlin hadmetamorphosed King Uther Pendragon, so that he resembled the husband of a queencalled Ygerne, with whom Uther was in love; Uther spent the night with her andshe conceived Arthur. Merlin was invented by Geoffrey of Monmouth, although hemay have been based on a northern bard called Myrddin. When Geoffrey was writinghis History in the 1130s, there was no castle at Tintagel, although there werethe ruins of a Celtic monastery. But a castle was built by the time the secondedition of the book appeared in 1145 and it seems probable that Geoffrey saw it.(The first edition has vanished, so there is no way of knowing whether TintagelCastle was mentioned in it as Arthur's birthplace.)All this leaves no possible doubt that Steiner's ‘spiritual perception’ of KingArthur and his twelve Knights of the Round Table was pure imagination. (Geoffreymakes no mention of the Round Table; this was added by the Norman poet Wace in along poem in 1155.) Steiner repeats his claim to have ‘seen’ the truth aboutKing Arthur in another lecture in Karmic Relationships (Vol. 4, No. 4):Even today, if one is receptive to these things, one receives a very realimpression which tells one what it was that the Knights of the Round Table ofKing Arthur did in their gigantic castle…Looking with occult vision at whattakes place there to this day, we receive a magnificent impression. We see themstanding there, these Knights of the Round Table, watching the play of powers oflight and air, water and earth, the elemental spirits…It was the task of theOrder of King Arthur, founded in that region by the instructions of Merlin, tocultivate and civilize Europe at a time when all Europe in its spiritual lifestood under the influence of the strangest elemental beings…There were, so tospeak, later ‘campaigns of Alexander’ undertaken by the Knights of the RoundTable into Europe, even as the real campaigns of Alexander had gone fromMacedonia into Asia.The reference to Alexander the Great is explained in an earlier lecture, inwhich Steiner speaks of ‘that genuine spiritual life which had been cultivatedas between Aristotle and Alexander’. According to Steiner, the motive ofAlexander in ‘conquering the world’ was to spread the treasures of wisdom farand wide. Although it is true that Alexander imbibed Greek culture from histeacher Aristotle, it is difficult for anyone who has studied his life to acceptthat he was interested in spreading the treasures of wisdom far and wide. He wasan alcoholic who killed his best friend in a drunken rage, and his motives seemto have been typical of the ‘world conqueror’—enjoyment of war for its own sake.Again, one suspects that Steiner was inventing another myth that was pleasing tohis imagination.In the lecture already cited, Steiner pokes mild fun at Maeterlinck. Maeterlinckhad described him as ‘one of the most erudite and also one of the most confusingamong contemporary occultists’. This, says Steiner, is like saying that a man isboth black and white at the same time. The comment is unfair; in fact, it isnonsensical. Maeterlinck is right: Steiner is both erudite and confusing, andthere is no contradiction. Steiner shows the same weakness in argument when hederides the comment that the introductions to his books reveal a well-balancedmind, but that later pages make it seem that he has suddenly gone mad.Very well, then…I write a book. Maeterlinck reads the introduction and I seem tohim to have an ‘extremely well-balanced, logical and comprehensive mind’. Thenhe reads on, and I turn into someone who makes him say: I don't know whetherRudolf Steiner has suddenly gone mad, or whether he is a hoaxer or a seer. Thenit happens again. I write a second book; when he reads the introductionMaeterlinck again accepts me as having an ‘extremely well-balanced, logical andcomprehensive mind’ [Steiner obviously enjoyed repeating this phrase]. Then hereads further contents and again does not know whether I am a lunatic or ahoaxer or a seer. And so it goes on. But suppose everybody were to say: when Iread your books you seem at the beginning, to be very clever, balanced andlogical, but then you suddenly go mad! People who are logical when they begin towrite and then as they write on suddenly become crazy, must indeed beextraordinary creatures! In the next book they switch round, are logical at thebeginning and later on again lunatics!But this kind of mockery leaves Maeterlinck's main point untouched. And the KingArthur episode suggests that he was basically correct. Steiner's ‘occult vision’could be misled by his imagination. And once we know this, it becomes verydifficult to accept Steiner's repeated assertions that his readings from the‘Akashic records’ are ‘a matter of conscientious research, no less exact in itsmethods than any researches in physics or chemistry…’ (Vol. 4, p. 30). He tellsus, for example, about how a certain Egyptian Initiate, whose business wasembalming mummies, gradually lost interest in his work, and allowed a servant todo it for him. In a later existence, the Initiate was reborn as Julia, thenymphomaniac daughter of Augustus, who married Tiberius, while the servantbecame the Roman historian Livy. Later still, the servant was reborn as themedieval minstrel poet, Walter von der Vogelweide. The Initiate was reborn as aTyrolese landowner who was Walter's patron. This landowner rediscovered thelegendary castle of the Dwarf King Laurin, hollowed out of the rocks, which‘made a profound impression upon him’. Finally, he was reborn as AugustStrindberg, whose misogyny was a reflection of his unsatisfactory career as aRoman nymphomaniac, while the servant became Strindberg's friend Dr LudwigSchleich. (It often happens, Steiner says, that people associated together inone existence meet again in later ones—for their karmas are interlinked.)Steiner met Schleich, and was able to trace back his previous lives by whatMaeterlinck calls a kind of ‘transcendental psychometry’.Karmic Relationships is full of astonishing revelations of this sort. We learnthat in an earlier existence, Karl Marx was a warlike Frenchman who often wentoff plundering his neighbours. One day he came back and found that his own houseand lands had been seized by another noble; he was forced to become this noble'svassal. In due course, the two were reborn as Marx and Engels; Marx's bitternessat having his lands seized would seem to explain how he came to write DasKapital …Reflecting upon Eduard von Hartmann's afflicted knee—which compelled him tospend most of his life on a couch—Steiner tells how he was ‘guided to one of hisearlier incarnations’ in which he was a knight in the Crusades. One day he met aman ‘concerning whom he felt instinctively that he had had something to do withhim in a still earlier life’. Moved by some instinctive distaste, Hartmannproceeded to persecute his former acquaintance in the midday sun. This injusticeliterally rebounded on Hartmann's head, for he suffered sunstroke. And becauseof some psychic law that connects the head and the knee, the sunstroke reappearsin his later existence as a diseased knee…In the same lecture, Steiner retells the story of his encounter with Nietzsche,and says he felt that Nietzsche's astral body and his ego were trying to escape,but his physical body and etheric body were too strong and healthy to allow thisto happen. Steiner's spiritual vision then led him to Nietzsche's previousincarnation, as a Franciscan monk, who spent his days inflictingself-punishment, kneeling in front of the altar until his knees were a mass ofbruises. This pain had the effect of knitting him closely with his physicalbody, so in his next incarnation, as Nietzsche, he had no desire to be in thebody at all…Steiner was obviously unaware of what now seems reasonably certain: thatNietzsche was suffering from the tertiary stage of syphilis. It is true thatthere are still some vestiges of doubt about this; but there can be no doubtthat Nietzsche's illness was basically physical in origin, and not—as Steinerbelieved—simply the result of his detestation of the age he was born into.Again, one is inclined to entertain some mild doubts about Steiner's ‘spiritualvision’.The answer to this central problem about Steiner can be found in his ownwritings about the ‘spiritual world’. In 1912 and 1913 he produced two littlebooks—now usually published together—called A Road to Self-Knowledge and TheThreshold of the Spiritual World . They contain an extremely useful and lucidsummary of his ideas on man's ‘four bodies’, on ‘supersensible worlds’, on‘cosmic beings’, and so on. Discussing how ‘spiritual events’ and beings come tomanifest themselves, he compares it to the act of remembering something. ‘Nowlet us imagine an image rising up in the soul in the same way as a picture ofmemory, yet expressing not something previously experienced, but somethingunfamiliar…If we do this, we have formed an idea of the way in which thespiritual world first makes its appearance in the soul when the latter issufficiently prepared for it.’ And he explains: ‘If the soul wishes to acquirethe ability to enter knowingly into the supersensible world, it must first ofall strengthen its powers by unfolding from within an activity which isfundamentally one of imagining.’To sceptics, this sounds like an admission that Steiner's ‘visions’ were pureimagination. But anyone with the slightest acquaintance with the occulttradition will read quite a different meaning into it. We have already notedAldous Huxley's comment that man has an immense inner world that could becompared to the earthly globe. Occultists call this the ‘astral world’. We can,according to the magical tradition, learn to ‘travel’ in this world just as inthe physical world. What it requires basically is a highly developed power ofvisualization . This involves training oneself to summon up mental pictures thatare as clear as real objects—for example, one of the simplest exercises isimagining a wooden cube, and trying to visualize it so clearly that you can turnit around, look at it from every angle, feel the texture of the wood, even smellit. Eventually it should even be possible to visualize with the eyes open,projecting the image into the real world. One authority on the subject suggeststhat it should take about a month of practice, for a quarter of an hour eachday. * [text00010.html#fnr3]Once this has been achieved, the next stage is to make a series of five cardscontaining ‘tattwa symbols’—symbols for earth, air, fire, water, and ether; thesymbols are coloured respectively yellow, blue, red, silver, and black. A symbolshould be chosen, and then stared at until it produces an ‘after image’; thisafter image will be in its complementary colour. At this point, the symbolshould be visualized in its complementary colour, with the eyes closed. Itshould then be regarded as a doorway , and the next step is to try topass—imaginatively—through this doorway. This is the first step of ‘astraltravel.’ Depending on what symbol has been chosen, the ‘landscape’ on the otherside of the doorway should be quite distinctive. And, according to practised‘astral voyagers’, it can be explored like any other landscape.Most of us will, admittedly, find it very difficult to envisage any such result,for our powers of visualization are feeble. There is, nevertheless, nothing‘unscientific’ about the notion. The psychologist Jung called it ‘activeimagination’, and had no doubt that it was a faculty that could be developed bymost people—although he warned about the danger of developing these powerswithout proper supervision. In his autobiography, Jung describes how he came todiscover his own power of active imagination. After the break with Freud in1912, Jung went through a mental crisis, and was for a time afraid of losing hissanity. Life became a continual struggle to fight off panic and foreboding. Oneday, seated at his desk, he suddenly decided to try the experiment of ‘lettinggo’ and surrendering completely to the chaotic forces of his unconscious mind.‘Then I let myself drop. Suddenly it was as though the ground literally gave waybeneath my feet, and I plunged into dark depths.’ Then he had a feeling oflanding on a soft, sticky mass, and found himself in deep twilight. In a whollyreal ‘waking dream’ he entered an underground cave and saw the body of a blondyouth floating down a stream, with a red sun rising in the background.Jung had discovered that he could ‘dream’ while awake, and he began to makeregular voyages into these mental realms. On one of these ‘journeys’ he met anold man and a blind girl who seemed to be real people. Subsequently, holdingconversations with one of these dream figures, he was convinced that ‘it was hewho spoke, not I’. It was this dream figure—whom he called Philemon—who taughthim ‘the objectivity of the psychic world’—a phrase of which Steiner wouldcertainly have approved.Like Ramakrishna after his attempt at suicide, Jung had induced in himself apermanent ability to enter these mental states, to break down inner barriersbetween the conscious and the unconscious.Some people, like the mystic William Blake, seem to be born with the ability toenter this mental—or astral—world of visions; as a child, Blake was beaten forsaying that he had seen a tree full of angels. But he undoubtedly had seen atree full of angels. Blake also laid enormous stress on the idea of imagination,and emphasized that it is the gateway to inner worlds. Emanuel Swedenborg, whosetemperament was altogether closer to Steiner's (he was trained as a scientistand engineer), had to pass through a severe mental crisis in middle life beforehe suddenly achieved his ability to see ‘visions’.Now we know that Steiner passed through a long period of mental crisis after heleft Weimar—although he says so little about it in his autobiography that it isdifficult to grasp exactly what happened. He says that his experience ofChristianity ‘underwent a severe test’, and speaks of ‘severe inner strugglesduring the time of testing’: ‘These inner struggles took place behind the scenesof everyday experience.’ They resulted eventually in his ‘revelation’, when hestood ‘in the spiritual presence of the Mystery of Golgotha in a most profoundand solemn festival of knowledge’.It is surely significant that this vision occurred just before the beginning ofthe new century, and of the new epoch in Steiner's life. Before this, he hadbeen vaguely hostile to Christianity, feeling, like Nietzsche, that it was anexcuse for indulging in daydreams of salvation. After the ‘vision’, Christbecame the centre of Steiner's life. The ‘vision’ was Steiner's equivalent ofRamakrishna's experience of the Divine Mother; it is clear from his work thatfrom then on the thought of Christ could produce a state of ecstasy, an immensewelling-up of inner conviction. It was at this point that Steiner's philosophybecame a ‘Christology’, with its central emphasis on Christ's descent intohistory to ensure man's ultimate salvation. This deep, unwavering conviction wasthe source of the enormous charisma that Steiner developed during this period ofhis life, and explains why his lectures made so many converts.Steiner himself admits, in The Threshold of the Spiritual World , that ‘itshould on no account be denied that it is difficult to distinguish betweenillusions and realities in this sphere’ of the spirit. He adds: ‘Many people whobelieve they have manifestations from a spiritual world are certainly onlyoccupied with their own memories, which they do not recognize as such.’ He seemsquite confident that he himself never makes this mistake. But, as we have seenin the case of his visit to Tintagel, he was capable of mistaking ‘activeimagination’ for a perception of reality.This is not to suggest that most of Steiner's ‘spiritual perceptions’ were aform of wishful thinking. Even a little book like The Threshold of the SpiritualWorld has a tone of sober precision, of scientific exactitude, that gives thereader an immediate sense of being in the hands of a man who knows what he istalking about. But when we turn from this to a book like Cosmic Memory , it isquite clear that the best attitude to Steiner is not one of unquestioningacceptance. Steiner was capable of being misled by his own highly developedpowers of active imagination, and it is up to the individual reader to decidefor himself just where he will draw the line. And since Steiner himself advisesus never to accept what he says on trust, such an attitude can only increasethose powers of scientific discernment and penetration that he regards as thefoundation of ‘spiritual vision’.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* [text00010.html#fn] Twentieth Century Mystics and Sages , p. 265.† [text00010.html#fn1] See Blueprint for Immortality: The Electric Patterns ofLife by Harold Burr (1972) and my Mysteries , p. 388.* [text00010.html#fn2] See my Psychic Detectives , Chapter 2.* [text00010.html#fn3] J.

He wrote: ‘At this Congress…it was alreadytaken for granted that a German Section of the Society should be established,with me as the General Secretary.’ So far there had only been a Theosophical‘lodge’ in Berlin. Marie von Sivers had been working in Bologna, helping aRussian Theosophist to establish an Italian lodge of the Society. So both musthave been regarded as figures of some importance. Steiner was to be not only thehead of the German branch, but also of the movement in Switzerland andAustria-Hungary. His working-class friend Rudolph found him much changed when hereturned to Berlin. He had shaved off his moustache and wore a bowler hat. Heseemed to place a distance between himself and his students, and Rudolph says‘The intimacy we experienced with him before was never recovered.’It was on 8 October 1902 that Rudolph attended a lecture by Steiner at theGiordano Bruno Bund, and it confirmed his worst fears. Instead of looking at hisaudience, Steiner stared out over their heads. His subject was ‘Monism andTheosophy’, and he began with an attack on Spiritualism. Then he went on toinsist that any serious philosophy of life must be based on the scientificmethod. The trouble with modern science was that it was too narrow, and thisresulted in materialism. But the real task of philosophy was to rise abovematerialism, to transform itself into theosophy by introducing the idea of God.He went on to speak approvingly of Thomas Aquinas as an example of a scientific‘monist’, a man who based his life's work on reason, yet who recognized that Godstands above reason.Long before the lecture ended, it was obvious that Steiner and his audience wereat loggerheads. When he finished, no one clapped and no one proposed a vote ofthanks; the meeting broke up in silence. Rudolph broke with Steiner after thislecture.Ten days later, Annie Besant was present when Steiner was appointed GeneralSecretary of the German section of the Society. Ten days later still, he began aseries of lectures to the new German Theosophical Society with a talk entitled‘Reflections on Karma’.Steiner's own account of his life—in the Autobiography—ends in 1907; but theyears from 1900 to 1907 occupy less than twenty-five pages, and are little morethan a hotchpotch; when he wrote them, Steiner was already suffering from theabdominal illness that was to kill him. But the story was taken up by Steiner'ssecretary Guenther Wachsmuth in his monumental Life and Work of Rudolf Steiner ,covering the period from 1900 to Steiner's death. Anyone who opens this bookexpecting a Boswellian account of Steiner will be disappointed. It seems toconsist very largely of sentences like: ‘After a brief lecture tour in SouthGermany, he went to Switzerland, and there, on September 19 in Basel, a newGroup was inaugurated…’; ‘In May 1907 he gave two public lectures in Munich onThe Bible and Wisdom , followed by a cycle of fourteen lectures on The Theosophyof the Rosicrucians …’. In fact, Steiner's life between 1900 and 1925 isbasically a record of his travels and his lectures. In twenty-five years hedelivered over six thousand lectures—an average of one lecture for every singleweekday. There were periods when this lecuring activity seemed to rise to afrenzy, as during the period of two and a half weeks in 1924 when he deliveredseventy lectures.By 1904, life was already becoming hectic. He had launched a magazine calledLucifer , and his correspondence was demanding. Wachsmuth records that a ‘smallgroup of persons’ came together to try to smooth his path by their unselfishco-operation. They carried his outgoing mail down to the post office in laundrybaskets.The year 1904 also saw publication of the first of Steiner's major ‘occult’works, Theosophy—An Introduction to the Supersensible Knowledge of the World andthe Destination of Man . In the opening chapter he explains that man is athreefold being, consisting of body, soul, and spirit—not a twofold being,consisting of body and soul, as Christianity has always taught. Body is whollymaterial; spirit is wholly ‘immaterial’. Soul is the bridge between them, thepart of man whose business is to acquire and digest experience for the spirit—itmight be regarded as a kind of spiritual stomach. Man acquires a different soulwith every incarnation. Steiner's final arrangement of the components of a humanbeing is as follows: (1) Physical body, (2) Etheric body (or Life-body), (3)Astral body, (4) Ego, (5) Spirit self (which is the transmuted astral body), (6)Life spirit (the transmuted etheric body), and (7) Spirit man (the transmutedphysical body). To link this with Madame Blavatsky's Theosophy, Steiner alsogives these components their Hindu names.The book continues with a brief account of reincarnation and karma—the thread of‘acquired destiny’ that runs from life to life as man is reborn. Then there isan account of the three worlds: physical, soul-world, and spirit-world,including a section on what happens to man after death. The ‘life field’ oretheric body dissolves in about three days, during which time the ego and astralbody see the whole of their past life unfolding before them (just as people onthe point of death are supposed to see their past lives in a few seconds). Thenthe ego and astral body enter purgatory (or ‘kamaloca’), for a period lastingabout one third of the lifetime just completed, during which the life is relivedand re-evaluated. It could be regarded as the equivalent of going through exampapers with the teacher after an exam is over. Since the astral body is stillcapable of feelings, it will suffer from all the unsatisfied desires and luststhat it still contains. Finally, purified by this suffering, the astral body candissolve. In kamaloca, we also experience everything we have done during ourlives seen from the point of view of those to whom we have done it . So themurderer would experience his crime from the point of view of the victim.After kamaloca, the ego rises to the spirit world, and can now choose its nextlife—and how to make restitution for any wrongs committed in the previous one.We choose the destiny we shall live through, the body we shall inhabit, as wellas our parents and the people we shall know in the next life on earth; we oftenchoose to associate once again with people we have known in previous lives, andwhose destinies are interwoven with our own. It is, says Steiner, pointless tobemoan one's lot, because we have chosen it ourselves before being born.Why, in that case, does everyone not choose to be handsome, rich, andsuccessful? Because the spirit's aim is its own evolution, and good fortune andsuccess could have the opposite effect. Spiritual progress can only be made onearth, not in the spirit world.Theosophy concludes with a chapter on ‘The Path of Knowledge’, attempting todescribe how a man can begin to acquire supersensible knowledge. Mathematics, hesays, forms an excellent preparation for the Path, for it teaches logic,detachment, and concentration upon non-physical realities. In other words, thefirst requirement for the ‘seeker’ is the scientific attitude, the certaintythat the mind can create order out of chaos. Man is not the helpless playthingof external forces, no matter how powerful and bewildering these forces may be.The first step is to recognize that he is capable of detachment, of using hismind as a compass to navigate his way through the confusion. Once he has donethis, he has already taken the first step towards ‘spiritual perception’. Hewill never again surrender totally to a sense of meaninglessness or defeat, forhe knows that his real being is rooted in the eternal world.Of all Steiner's books, Theosophy is probably the best through which to approachSteiner's ideas. It is short and well written (which is more than can be saidfor its successor, Knowledge of the Higher Worlds and Its Attainment , which isdry and abstract). It states his basic views about the spirit and life afterdeath clearly and straightforwardly. But even if we choose to reject these—or tosuspend judgement on them—the book has an atmosphere of serenity and detachmentthat produces on the reader the same effect as the Bhagavad Gita , or theMeditations of Marcus Aurelius, or Boethius’ Consolations of Philosophy . Itallows the open-minded reader to take the measure of Steiner's mind; and nomatter what doubts we may feel about his ‘esoteric’ doctrines, that measure isimpressive. No book shows more clearly that, no matter what his faults may havebeen, Steiner was no charlatan.Yet for anyone with a wider interest in the ‘paranormal’, the book does raisesome puzzling questions. Steiner's attitude to spiritualism seems to be one ofcomplete dismissal. On the day after the notorious ‘Monism’ lecture he told adisciple that ‘the spiritualists are the worst materialists of all’. In thelight of his own philosophy, it is easy to understand why he said this: there isa certain literal-mindedness about the spiritualists that was bound to strikeSteiner as simplistic. Most of them seem to feel that the ‘riddle of existence’is solved by the assumption that we simply go on living in the ‘next world’. Onthe other hand, there can be no doubt that the phenomenon of ‘mediumship’ reallyexists, and that there is strong evidence that mediums have been in touch withthe dead. How could Steiner take up such an apparently negative attitude?The answer can be found in a lecture called ‘The History of Spiritism’ deliveredin Berlin on 30 May 1904. Here, he explains that there was a time in the pastwhen man found it far more easy to contact the dead. ‘The questions which theSpiritist wishes to answer today were during ancient times the concern of theso-called Mysteries.’It was clearly understood that in each human being, spiritual forces slumberwhich in the average man are not developed. But spiritual forces slumber inhuman nature which can be awakened and developed by prolonged exercises, throughstages of evolution that are described by the adherents of the Mysteries as verydifficult. When a man had developed such forces in himself and had become ableto make research into truth, the opinion was then held that such a researcherwas related to the ordinary man just as one who can see is related to a man bornblind. That is what those in the holy Mysteries aimed at.According to Steiner, there were in the Middle Ages certain secret societieswhich led their members ‘to the development of higher intuitive forces along thesame lines that had been followed by the ancient Mysteries’. Then, with the riseof materialism, this direct, intuitive ‘knowledge of higher worlds’ slowly fadedaway.And at this point, along came Spiritualism, with its mediums going into trances,its speaking trumpets flying around the room, its ‘spirits’ made of ectoplasm,and all the rest of the paraphernalia. The trouble with Spiritualism, accordingto Steiner, is that it encourages man to remain blind , instead of trying toachieve that direct, intuitive insight into the spirit world.Oddly enough, Steiner thoroughly approved of Allan Kardec, the Frenchman who, inthe mid-1850s, compiled an important body of ‘spirit teachings’ from automaticwriting—The Spirits’ Book . Kardec, like Steiner, accepted the reality ofreincarnation. The rest of the French spiritualist movement, like the Englishspiritualists, flatly rejected it.During these early years as a Theosophist, Steiner's main concern seems to havebeen to emphasize the continuity of the great religious tradition, from themystery centres of primitive man to the creation of Anthroposophy. This had beenone of the major themes of Madame Blavatsky; but Steiner took it further—a taskfor which he was well qualified through his knowledge of history and philosophy.Reading Wachsmuth's Life , it becomes very clear that Steiner believed that hecould, single-handed, create a great religious movement comparable toChristianity or Islam. The time seemed propitious; there was a widespread hungerfor ‘spiritual values’, and he had made many powerful allies: in 1904, forexample, he stayed in Lugano as a guest of the industrialist Guenther Wagner,and began his ‘conquest’ of Switzerland. A student named Ludwig Kleeberg starteda Theosophical group at the University of Munich, with the blessing of theRector; in the following year, the movement spread to the University of Marburg.With his lectures, Steiner made an immediate impact that has led one Germancommentator * [text00011.html#fnr] to compare him to Hitler. Kleeberg said ofhim:He began to lecture. His gaze, first turned outward, seemed now and then to beturned inward. He spoke out of an inner vision. The sentences were formed whilehe spoke. There was power in his words. In his words dwelt the power to awakento life the slumbering unison of hearts. The hearts sensed something of thepower of which his words were formed, and felt a strengthening of that tiewhich…connected them with the reality of a larger, broader and richer world.This undoubtedly explains Steiner's enormous influence: his ability to conveythe feeling of a ‘broader and richer world’. Another disciple, the writer AlbertSteffen, described how he travelled to the ancient town of Augsburg to hearSteiner lecture: ‘as I walked through Augsburg's old streets, it seemed to me asif everybody harboured this festival feeling, as if it were poured into everydaylife…A fragrant breeze arose, filling me with the bliss of knowledge as Iinhaled the sky's purple.’ And as he came out of one of Steiner's lectures: ‘Itseemed to me that I felt spheres of consciousness which…we usually do not see,or at least, do not heed…’. Steiner filled his disciples with a sense of poetry,a feeling that the world was about to be ‘shattered, and rebuilt nearer to theheart's desire’. So in a sense, it is not inappropriate to compare him to Hitlerwho, in the mid-1930s, filled his audiences with the feeling that the world wasabout to be transformed by a kind of Wagnerian idealism, and raised to a newmythological level of reality. Steiner's movement lacked the sinister undertonesof Nazism, but its appeal was otherwise similar in many ways. This helps toexplain the increasingly bitter opposition he experienced as the years went by;it was based upon the feeling that anybody who can acquire such an enormousfollowing by preaching a fundamentally irrational doctrine must be a charlatanand a trickster.But during the early years, things went deceptively smoothly. Steiner travelledand lectured, and took every opportunity to visit historic sites and ancientmonuments, always receiving strong ‘spiritual impressions’. In 1903 he was inLondon again for another Theosophical congress, and launched his magazineLucifer . In 1904 he was at the Theosophical congress in Amsterdam, and lecturedthroughout Germany. In 1905 he lectured extensively on Richard Wagner, an artistfor whom he felt profound sympathy, since Wagner had laboured to create his own‘Mystery centre’ in Bayreuth, and had subsequently crowned his career with acelebration of the Christian mystery in Parsifal . In 1906, Steiner enjoyed aremarkable personal triumph at the Theosophical congress in Paris, where he setup a kind of rival congress in the suburb of Passy, filling the house withdistinguished Russians—like the mystical novelist Merejkovsky—and creating anatmosphere of enthusiasm and dedication. He finally met Edouard Schuré, authorof The Great Initiates , whose drama The Children of Lucifer had been translatedby Marie von Sivers; Schuré stated in print that at last he had met a genuineInitiate. He said of Steiner: ‘The first impression was one of plastic power.When he spoke of the events and phenomena of the supersensible world, he spokeas one who was at home there…He did not describe; he beheld objects and scenesand made them visible, so that cosmic phenomena seemed to us like actual objectsof the physical plane. When one listened to him, it was impossible to doubt hisspiritual vision, which was as keen as physical sight…’.In 1907, Steiner lectured in Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland, and washost to the Theosophical congress in Munich. It was his opportunity to show whathe could do. The great concert hall was elaborately decorated in a way thatwould ‘correspond in form and colour with the mood prevailing in the oralprogramme’. He encouraged the designers to give ‘free expression to artisticfeeling’—an approach which may be said to be the essence of Steiner's theory ofart, drama, and education. He also broke with Theosophical tradition bypresenting a Mystery drama. It was Schuré's Sacred Drama of Eleusis , an attemptto reconstruct the ancient Greek mystery drama. This is, in fact, a powerfulpiece of work that can bear comparison with Sophocles or Euripides: the story ofhow Persephone was dragged down to the underworld by Pluto—with the connivanceof Zeus—and how she was rescued by Prince Triptolemos, son of the king ofEleusis. But the essence of the drama is the part played by the god Dionysus,Persephone's brother. Dionysus had been born when Zeus embraced Demeter, theearth goddess, in the form of a flaming astral serpent. But when the beautifulchild was contemplating his own reflection in a mirror, the Titans threwthemselves on him and tore him to pieces. Zeus destroyed them, and mankind wasborn from the vapours of their burning bodies, mingled with the vapours of thedismembered Dionysus. Demeter then seduced the lord of the gods against his willand conceived Persephone.When Persephone is rescued from hell by the hero Triptolemos, Dionysus issuddenly reborn, for he is the spirit of heroism in human beings, which alsocreates men of genius. The reborn Dionysus takes Persephone, goddess offertility, to be his bride, symbolizing the union of male genius and heroismwith female fertility.Whether Schuré's reconstruction of the Orphic Mystery drama bears anyresemblance to the original is an open question. But it obviously appealed toSteiner because of its message that Dionysus—the primal ecstasy that springsfrom the heart of creation (Steiner knew his Nietzsche)—is reborn out of humanheroism and genius, and unites with the female principle to save the world. (Itmay be significant that Marie von Sivers played Persephone.) Annie Besant, astately, silver-haired lady, was evidently greatly impressed, and made amiableremarks about ‘the land of great philosophers, poets and mystics’. For theGerman Theosophists, it was a moment of triumph to see their own leader standingas an equal beside the leader of the Theosophical Society, Madame Blavatsky'selected heir. Yet it was also the beginning of the split between Steiner and theTheosophists; it was at this congress that Annie Besant agreed that there shouldbe a complete break between her own ‘esoteric group’ and Steiner's. It must havebeen obvious to her that what Steiner meant by esotericism had very little incommon with the teachings of The Secret Doctrine .Later that May, Steiner gave a lecture in Munich on ‘The Theosophy of theRosicrucians’. It could be regarded as an explicit gesture of rejection ofMadame Blavatsky's esotericism, for according to Steiner, the Rosicrucian epochof human development—which began in 1413—was a period in which initiation ceasedto be restricted to a few adepts, and would become available to men engaged inthe everyday business of the world. For those who entertain doubts aboutSteiner's visions of Atlantis and Lemuria, his notions about Rosicrucianism arebound to increase their scepticism. Rosicrucianism actually made its appearanceon the historical scene in 1614, with the publication in Kassel, in Germany, ofa pamphlet called The Fame of the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross . This declaredthat a certain Christian Rosenkreuz had spent life wandering around the East insearch of occult wisdom; having found it, he formed a Brotherhood of the RosyCross to preserve it; buried in an unknown tomb, surrounded by lighted candles,his body remained undiscovered for a hundred and twenty years. Then disciplesopened the tomb, which was lighted by ‘another sun’ in the middle of theceiling—an interesting anticipation of electric light—and found the body ‘wholeand unconsumed’.Rosenkreuz had been born in 1378, and had died, at the age of 106, in 1484; aninscription on the door of the tomb read ‘I will open after 120 years’. It wasopened in 1604, as prophesied.The opening of the vault, according to the pamphlet, would to be drawn of ageneral reformation presaging the appearance of a ‘divine light in the sky’(presumably the Second Coming).A second pamphlet, the Confessio , followed a year later, hinting at marvellousoccult knowledge. According to the Fama , ‘interested parties’ only had to maketheir interest known, and they would be contacted. Many people hastened toproclaim their interest in pamphlets; but, as far as is known, no one was evercontacted. Then in 1616, a third Rosicrucian work was published, The ChemicalWedding of Christian Rosenkreuz , a kind of allegorical novel, full ofalchemical symbolism. It has since been established that the author of this workwas a Tübingen clergyman named Johann Valentin Andreae, who later admitted thathe had composed it as a ‘ludibrium’—a joke. He denied being the author of thetwo earlier pamphlets, no doubt to avoid the indignation of would-be Initiates.One expert on the Rosicrucians, Christopher McIntosh, * [text00011.html#fnr1]has suggested that the pamphlets were the brainchild of an idealistic group ofyoung men who dreamed of ‘a Europe free of religious dissension and basking inthe light of the true Christian faith combined with science and learning’—a goodsummary of Steiner's own aims. Andreae wrote the Chemical Wedding in 1605, atthe age of nineteen, and McIntosh speculates that the young idealists decided toresurrect its narrator, Christian Rosenkreuz, and make him the founder of aBrotherhood that might become a rallying point for the new religious revival.They were probably startled and shocked by the success of their hoax. Andreaehimself published in 1619 a ‘Utopian’ work called Christianopolis .Rosicrucianism spread across Europe, rather like Freemasonry, and KingFrederick-William of Prussia was initiated into the order in 1781. In England inthe last quarter of the nineteenth century, a Rosicrucian Society became theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, of which the poet W. B. Yeats was a member.In an essay on Christian Rosencrux (as he spelt it) Yeats wrote: ‘I cannot getit out of my mind that this age of criticism is about to pass, and an age ofimagination, of emotion, of moods, of revelation, about to come in its place;for certainly belief in a supersensual world is at hand.’ Yeats is expressingthe tremendous emotional hunger that helps to explain the immense success ofSteiner's brand of Theosophy in the first decade of the twentieth century.As an ironical footnote to Steiner's Rosicrucian revelations, we may note thatone of his followers, Max Heindel, moved to America and wrote a book called TheRosicrucian Cosmo-Conception or Mystic Christianity , largely borrowed fromSteiner; it became the basis of the American Rosicrucian Society, one of themost successful organizations of its kind. Even the crumbs from Steiner's tablecould feed multitudes.Throughout 1908 Steiner continued to travel and lecture throughout Europe, andat an Annual General Meeting in October, Marie von Sivers was able to announcethat, since the spring, the number of Steiner groups had increased fromtwenty-eight to thirty-seven. When Steiner stood up to speak, he began byannouncing that it was his painful duty to expel a certain Dr Vollrath from theSociety; it seemed that Dr Vollrath had formed a Literary Section withoutconsulting Steiner, and had been guilty of various other acts of independence.Steiner followed up this excommunication with a lecture on the meaning ofself-denial, renunciation, and sacrifice. After the meeting, a reception wasgiven by Frau Eliza von Moltke, wife of the chief of the army General Staff.General von Moltke was quoted as saying that all great philosophies had agap—except Rudolf Steiner's Theosophy.The chief event of the following year, 1909, was the publication of Steiner'sbook Occult Science—an Outline , regarded by many as his most important work. Itrepeats many of the things said in Theosophy and Knowledge of Higher Worlds ;but its central section, a long chapter entitled ‘The Evolution of the World andMan’, goes a great deal further than the earlier books in describing man'sevolution on Old Saturn, Old Sun, Old Moon, and so on. It should be born in mindthat his earlier work on this topic—Cosmic Memory —had been published piecemealin his magazine, and so had only been read by the faithful. This openpublication, in a form available to the general public, may therefore beregarded as a gesture of supreme self-confidence. But a short postscript revealsthat he is not wholly unconcerned about his critics. He offers an excellentsummary of the kind of things they might say, accusing him of ‘inconceivableignorance of the rudiments of science’. Does that mean, asks Steiner, that hehimself would dismiss the critic as an ignoramus? By no means, for he can quiteunderstand how such a critic feels. All the same, he must inform him that he, DrSteiner, has studied physics and chemistry, the philosophy of Kant, and haswritten books on Goethe, not to mention a defence of Haeckel. So let no onemistake him for a member of the lunatic fringe. He ends by remarking that‘anyone acquainted with supersensual research’ will recognize that he has triedto communicate only ‘what is permitted’, although it is possible that, in thefuture, he may be allowed to say more.In other words, Steiner was telling his critics that if they didn't like what hehad to say, they knew what they could go and do…Such an attitude was bound toexasperate even the open-minded, an attitude that is betrayed by MauriceMaeterlinck in the final paragraph of his remarks on Steiner in The Great Secret: ‘When all is taken into account, we realize once more, as we lay his worksaside, what we realized after reading most of the other mystics: that what hecalls “the great drama of [occult] knowledge”…should rather be called the greatdrama of essential and invincible ignorance.’ If a man as tolerant andundogmatic as Maeterlinck could become so irritable, it is hardly surprisingthat less broad-minded critics should feel that Steiner was a kind of pestilencethat ought to be stamped out. As Steiner's hold over the faithful continued toincrease, so did the resentment of people who felt that the Steinerites were acrowd of besotted lunatics enslaved by a confidence trickster. And this, it mustbe admitted, was to some extent his own fault. His fellow ‘occultist’ Gurdjieff,who had just embarked on his own career as a teacher in Russia, took care thathis own esoteric teaching should remain secret, and so never incurred theresentment that eventually inflicted such blows on the Anthroposophicalmovement. Steiner could easily have done the same thing: used his books tospread the idea of ‘spiritual development’, and reserved the ‘cosmological’teachings for the faithful. In retrospect, it seems that his failure to do sowas his greatest single mistake.For Steiner, 1909 was a crucial year in the history of the German Theosophicalmovement, being the beginning of a new seven-year cycle. Steiner attached greatimportance to seven-year cycles—in the history of movements as well as ofindividuals. He was later to declare that the year 1909 was the beginning of ‘avery special time’, in which those who wished to be close to Christ couldachieve it in ‘a quite different way from that of previous times’. This wasbecause there was a ‘new action of Christ in the etheric world’. This may alsoexplain why, during 1909, he became increasingly outspoken against the‘orientalizing’ tendencies of the Theosophical Society.The year 1910 was as hectic as previous years, beginning with lectures inScandinavia, then in Berlin, then in Cologne, Stuttgart, and Munich, then inVienna; after this he travelled through Italy to Sicily, and lectured in Rome on‘The Intervention of Great Personalities who share in our Earth Evolution’.There he met a British painter named Harry Collison, who became anAnthroposophist and went off to found Societies in America, Australia, and NewZealand.On his return from the Italian tour, Steiner spent a few weeks dashing off aplay called The Portal of Initiation , a ‘Mystery drama’ which was presented inAugust at the Munich congress, preceded by Schuré's Drama of Eleusis . Steinerdesigned the set and costumes, dictating the colours in accordance with Goethe'scolour theory. All the actors were amateurs, trained by Marie von Sivers. Theplay was performed before an audience of two thousand people. Drama critics werenot invited.It is difficult to speak with detachment about the four Mystery dramas (forSteiner was to write another one in each of the three succeeding years). ForWachsmuth they are ‘the blest fruit of the interplay of spiritual vision andartistic formative power’. Stewart Easton emphasizes their kinship with theolder Greek tragedies, particularly those of Aeschylus, except in the length ofthe speeches. The non-Anthroposophist is bound to find them over-long,incredibly tedious, and at times painfully naive. People stand around and argueat enormous length about ‘dry, prosaic reason’ and the need for spiritualvision, and utter comments like: ‘With your last words I am in full agreement’,or ‘The weight of this objection I can feel.’ A scene may begin with words like:‘Good morning, Sophia. I hope I am not disturbing you?’‘Not at all, Estella, you are very welcome.’Or:‘Dear mother, I would so much like to hear the story from you, of which Cilli sooften spoke, some time ago…’.Schuré's Mystery drama has power, economy, and action; Steiner's plays ramble ongently, like a Steiner lecture converted into a Wagner libretto—but,unfortunately, without the music. No doubt Wachsmuth and Easton are right whenthey insist that they should be judged by their content, not by their literaryquality. But the need to make such allowances underlines one of the basicproblems of esoteric movements: that the very nature of their belief tends toirritate and repel non-believers because it seems to involve a deliberatesuspension of their critical faculties. It would be pleasant to be able to say:‘I cannot accept most of Steiner's ideas, but his Mystery plays are neverthelessan exciting and moving experience.’ In fact, the Mystery dramas constitute agulf between believers and non-believers instead of a bridge. Whatever theirunderlying content, they are ‘serious’ in quite the wrong way. The majorcharacter is a spiritual teacher named Benedictus, obviously Steiner himself.Most of the other characters are his disciples. Ahriman, Lucifer and variousspirits also appear—the tone is often reminiscent of Faust , but a Faust withoutpoetry and without the concentration. For the non-believer the whole atmospherehas a flavour of Sunday school. It is not Steiner's sincerity that is inquestion here, but his judgement.This view receives a certain support from a book on Steiner by a man who was tobecome one of his most important followers, Friedrich Rittelmeyer, a Protestanttheologian. At the time he came upon Steiner's work—in 1910—Rittelmeyer was oneof the most popular and influential preachers in Berlin. When asked to lectureon ‘religious striving in the present time’, he decided to make the acquaintanceof Theosophy. Annie Besant's variety sickened him: ‘The spirit, as presented bythem, was a mixture of ancient tradition and subjective emotionalism.’ He foundSteiner altogether more interesting, but was thoroughly put off by OccultScience . ‘It upset me, for I simply could not wade through it. If I read forany length of time, a feeling of nausea came over me.’ Finally, in 1911, heattended a Steiner lecture, and was not impressed by the audience. ‘A certainpassive, sensation-mongering mentality troubled me.’ Neither did Steiner impresshim as a speaker; he found his style ‘round-about and involved’. He was grimlyamused by the crowds of admiring disciples who thronged around Steiner after thelecture. It was not until he heard Steiner lecture on Goethe that he began tofeel that ‘this was a kingly mind in the realms of knowledge’. Even so, he foundthe next lecture he attended a disappointment, and was irritated by Steiner'sfur coat and flowing black tie. But Rittelmeyer, like Steiner, was obsessed bythe figure of Christ, and it was Steiner's ‘Christology’ that eventually formedthe link between them; Steiner was later to entrust to Rittelmeyer theorganization of an Anthroposophical Christian Community.The presentation—and design—of the Mystery dramas led Steiner to give newconsideration to the problem of art in general and dramatic art in particular.Wagner had united music and drama. The Russian composer Alexander Scriabin wasattempting something even more ambitious, a new art form that would involvemusic, drama, dance, and even colours blending on a screen—produced by a machineof his own invention called a ‘colour organ’. His music had a swooning, ecstaticquality, and seemed to be an illustration of his belief that some greatapocalypse was at hand when spirit would finally overcome matter, and man wouldbecome a god. When he died, of blood poisoning, in 1915, he was working on hisgreatest project, a Mystery that would take place in a temple and involvehundreds of virgins dressed in white robes. In 1911, he was regarded as one ofthe most significant artistic figures of his time.Another was the dancer Isadora Duncan; she also believed that feelings could bedanced, and swayed gracefully around the stage with bare feet and wearing aGrecian tunic. A rather more systematic version of the same thing was the methoddeveloped by the Swiss composer Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, who taught his pupilsmusic by training them in harmonious bodily movement; from merely performinggymnastics, his pupils would gradually learn to improvise body movements toexpress a whole symphony or concerto.Steiner called his own version of the dance ‘Eurythmy’, insisting at the sametime that it should not be confused with the art of dancing. Its aim was to‘cause a person or group of persons to carry out movements which bring toexpression the element of music and language in visible form, just as the organsof language and song do it in audible form. The whole human being or group ofhuman beings becomes a larynx…’ Steiner was striving for the same kind of unitythat Scriabin had dreamed of achieving in his own Mystery. And this, in turn,would be an integral part of a still greater unity of art, science, andreligion—thus reuniting the three components that should never have becomeseparated. Eurythmy was developed by a seventeen-year-old girl, Lory Smits—inclose association with Steiner—in 1912 (although Steiner was toying with theidea as early as 1908), and was first presented in public at the Munich festivalin the following years.We can catch an interesting glimpse of the impression Steiner made on peopleduring this period in the diaries of the young Franz Kafka, a writer who wouldacquire a worldwide reputation only after his death in 1924, at the age offorty. In 1911, when Kafka was in his mid-twenties, Steiner delivered a numberof lectures in Berlin, and Kafka went to hear him. The tone is ironic;obviously, Kafka is inclined to feel hostile.Theosophical lectures by Dr Rudolf Steiner, Berlin. Rhetorical effect:Comfortable discussion of the objections of opponents, the listener isastonished at this strong opposition, further development and praise of theseobjections, the listener becomes worried, complete immersion in these objectionsas though they were nothing else, the listener now considers any refutation ascompletely impossible and is more than satisfied with a cursory description ofthe possibility of a defence.Continual looking at the palm of the extended hand. Omission of the period. Ingeneral, the spoken sentence starts off from the speaker with its initialcapital letter, curves in its course, as far as it can, out to the audience, andreturns with the period to the speaker. But if the period is omitted then thesentence, no longer in check, falls upon the listener immediately with fullforce.Two days later, Kafka's account of another lecture is even more ironicallydetached and hostile:Dr Steiner is so very much taken up with his absent disciples. At the lecturethe dead press so about him. Hunger for knowledge? But do they really need it?Apparently, though—Sleeps two hours. Ever since someone once cut off hiselectric light he has always had a candle with him—He stood very close toChrist—He produced his play in Munich (you can study it all the year there andwon't understand it). He designed the costumes, composed the music—He instructeda Chemist…He is, perhaps, not the greatest contemporary psychic scholar, but he alone hasbeen assigned the task of uniting theosophy and science. And that is why heknows everything too. Once a botanist came to his native village, a great masterof the occult. He enlightened him.That I would look up Dr Steiner was interpreted to me by the lady as thebeginning of recollection. The lady's doctor, when the first signs of influenzaappeared in her, asked Dr Steiner for a remedy, prescribed this for the lady,and restored her to health with it immediately. A French woman said goodbye tohim with ‘au revoir ’. Behind her back he shook his head. In two months shedied. A similar case in Munich. A Munich doctor cures people with coloursdecided upon by Dr Steiner. He also sends invalids to the picture gallery withinstructions to concentrate for half an hour or longer on a certain painting.End of the Atlantic world, lemuroid destruction, and now through egoism. We livein a period of decision. The efforts of Dr Steiner will succeed only if theAhrimanian forces do not get the upper hand.He eats two litres of emulsion of almonds and fruits that grow in the air.He communicates with his absent disciples by means of thought-forms which hetransmits to them without bothering about them after they are generated. Butthey soon wear out and he must replace them.Mrs F.: ‘I have a poor memory.’ Dr St.: ‘Eat no eggs.’Clearly, Kafka regarded Steiner as a fake messiah. This probably tells us moreabout Kafka than about Steiner. Yet it also enables us to understand why so manypeople regarded Steiner with hostility. Kafka's own attitude towards him wasobviously ambivalent. Shortly after this last lecture, he decided to pay a visitto Steiner, which he describes in detail. Kafka quotes his ‘prepared address’ toSteiner—how he felt that a great part of his being was moving towards theosophy,but at the same time that he had the greatest fear of it: ‘That is to say, I amafraid it will result in a new confusion which would be very bad for me, becauseeven my present unhappiness consists only of confusion.’ He goes on to describehis confusion and unhappiness at great length, and then explains that in certainmoments when he is writing, he experiences the state that Steiner seems todescribe as clairvoyance. He is tempted to give up his job to become a writer,and yet realizes that this is a thoroughly impractical idea. What advice canSteiner give him?He listened very attentively without apparently looking at me at all, entirelydevoted to my words. He nodded from time to time, which he seems to consider anaid to strict concentration. At first a quiet head cold disturbed him, his noseran, he kept working his handkerchief deep into his nose, one finger at eachnostril.And that is all Kafka has to tell us about Rudolf Steiner. He sees with thethoroughly unsympathetic eye of a young man of talent who rather resents thefame of other people. Yet if we try to place ourselves behind Steiner's eyes,looking at this nervous, pale young man who talks rapidly and at inordinatelength, admitting that he is thoroughly confused, and pouring out hispsychological problems, it is impossible not to feel that Steiner deservesadmiration for his almost saintly forbearance. Of the crowds of people whodemanded personal interviews, probably only one in a thousand happened topossess genius, as Kafka did. But this was hardly any consolation for Steiner.The endless queue of time-wasters undermined his health and finally destroyedhim.During this period, relations with the London-based Theosophical Society werebecoming increasingly strained. This was due largely to Steiner's repudiation of‘orientalism’, and his increasing emphasis on the importance of Christ: in 1911,he had even gone so far as to say: ‘To grasp the idea of freedom without theidea of salvation by Christ ought not to be found possible by mankind; on thatcondition alone is the idea of freedom justified’—a somewhat baffling statementfor the author of The Philosophy of Freedom .What made the rupture between the English and the German Society inevitable wasthe discovery of a new ‘messiah’ by the English Theosophist The Revd CharlesLeadbeater. In 1909, Leadbeater was on a beach near Adyar, India, when he saw anexceptionally beautiful Indian child. Leadbeater claimed that he was instantlyimpressed by the boy's remarkable aura, but the fact that Leadbeater was apederast may also have played its part. Leadbeater persuaded the boy's father, aminor civil servant who held a post in the Theosophical Society in Madras, toallow him to take Jiddu, and his younger brother Nitya, into his house. MrsBesant met Jiddu and was convinced that he was the latest incarnation of themaster Maitreya, and that he would be the saviour of the twentieth century.Leadbeater, who—like Steiner—claimed to be able to divine past incarnations,even wrote an account of the boy's previous thirty lives, starting in 22,662 BC.The German Theosophists were naturally outraged by this attempt to foist a newmessiah on them, not only because it was in direct contradiction to Steiner'steachings about Christ, but because it looked suspiciously like an attempt toupstage their own German Messiah. Steiner was offered a ‘package deal’; if hewould accept Krishnamurti as the new Christ, he could be John the Baptist;apparently he rejected this with indignation. When, in 1911, The Society foundedthe Order of the Star of the East, with Krishnamurti as its object of adoration,the break became inevitable. Steiner declared that no one who joined the newOrder could remain a member of his Society. Mrs Besant retaliated by having thecharter of the German Society revoked by the General Council. (Fourteen Germanlodges remained loyal; the rest went with Steiner.) The German Society sent hera telegram demanding her resignation. And finally, in February 1913, Steinerchanged the name of the German branch to the Anthroposophical Society. TheTheosophists, understandably—and, on the whole, justly—accused him of using theSociety purely as a means of forwarding his own ambitions; certainly, Steinerwould never have achieved his large following if he had remained an independentlecturer.Apart from the founding of the Anthroposophical Society, 1913 was much like theprevious years. Steiner undertook nine foreign lecture tours, wrote a newMystery drama, The Soul's Awakening , supervised the first presentation ofEurythmy in public, and turned his attention increasingly to the problem of dietand nutrition, condemning the consumption of meat and alcohol. But he was notdogmatic about it, and did not insist that all Anthroposophists should bevegetarians. When one of them admitted to him he still dreamed about ham,Steiner replied: ‘Better eat ham than think ham.’ And although he disapproved ofsmoking (he had given it up himself, and switched to snuff) he made no attemptto force his views on his secretary Wachsmuth.Now the Anthroposophical Society had become a separate entity, and showed everysign of continuing to expand, it was necessary to give some thought to thequestion of its headquarters. To begin with, Steiner wanted a theatre suitablefor presenting his Mystery dramas—he was now planning a fifth. The obviouschoice was Munich, Germany's artistic capital, but Stuttgart, which had a largeSteiner Society, was a strong rival. Then, to everyone's surprise, the Munichauthorities turned down the plan to build an Anthroposophical Societyheadquarters and theatre; they had no desire to see their city turned into theBayreuth of a peculiar religious sect. Fortunately, an alternative had alreadypresented itself. A Swiss Anthroposophist, Dr Emil Grossheintz, had purchased ahill at Dornach in Switzerland, and he wished it to be used for some purposeconnected with Anthroposophy; Steiner had already been to inspect it when theMunich authorities turned down his application. Steiner decided immediately thathe would build his theatre at Dornach, and lost no time in designing it.Predictably—in view of his ideas on plasticity and Nature—it was a place withfew right angles and straight lines. The idea was to create a building, atemple, that looked as if it might have grown like a tree. The building wascalled the Goetheanum, a name more-or-less unpronounceable for English readers.The foundation stone was laid on 20 September 1913, large sums of money havingbeen collected or pledged at the Munich festival of the previous month.As Steiner made a speech and laid the foundation stone—composed of a doublepentagonal dodecahedron—a tremendous storm broke, virtually drowning his voice.As night fell prematurely, the small band of followers lighted torches, whileSteiner spoke of the increasing forces of Ahriman, ‘who intends to spreaddarkness and chaos’. It was as if the elements were trying to tell him that itwas the worst possible moment to build a temple.Steiner was hoping to complete the building by August 1914, so it could be usedto present his fifth Mystery drama (which, in the event, remained unwritten).But by the new year it was obvious that the funds they had collected were aboutto run out; Steiner quickly organized a series of lectures to the faithful,emphasizing the importance of this joint project for the future salvation ofhumanity. More money flowed in; many Anthroposophists gave up their jobs andmoved to Dornach to help build the Goetheanum. By April 1914, the framework wasin place, and the two great domes were ready to be covered with slate. Most ofthe Goetheanum was built of wood, in accordance with Steiner's feeling that itshould be ‘natural’. This was a decision that everyone would have reason toregret.When the Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated at Sarajevo on 28 June 1914,it became increasingly clear that the August festival would not take place.Steiner was on his way to Bayreuth in early August when the war broke out.Steiner was forced to rush back to Dornach, surrounded by increasing chaos:guards on every bridge, soldiers marching, railway stations jammed with people.With the aid of an Anthroposophist who was also a railway official, Steiner andMarie von Sivers were hastily pushed into a compartment of a train in Stuttgart;hours later, they were back across the Swiss border. Marie von Sivers remarks:‘During this terrible grey night, the world had changed, and the expression of anightmare which rested during those days upon Dr Steiner's face, his pain onaccount of humanity, was almost unbearable.’For all his optimism and determination to continue, Steiner must have sensedthat this was the end of his dream. He had hoped that the building of theGoetheanum signalled a new epoch in the evolution of mankind, the beginning of areligion that would sweep across the world as irresistibly as Christianity inthe first century or Muhammadism in the seventh. Now it was very clear that theworld had other things on its mind beside religion. As far as Europe wasconcerned, Anthroposophy belonged to the past, not the future.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* [text00011.html#fn] Hitler, Steiner, Schreber , by Dr Wolfgang Treher.* [text00011.html#fn1] The Rosy Cross Unveiled (Aquarian Press, 1980)."},{"pageContent":"EightDisasterALTHOUGH for Europe the war was an unmitigated disaster, for Steiner it had itscompensations. He was able to work quietly at the task of completing theGoetheanum, with the aid of many disciples, to spend time in reflection, and towrite some of his most significant books, like Riddles of Man and Riddles of theSoul . He was still able to travel and lecture to a remarkable extent—for, asWachsmuth remarks, the time of endless difficulties with travel permits had notyet arrived—but it was no longer at the same frantic pace as in the pre-waryears. He was patriotic, but in a non-nationalistic sense; he lectured in manyGerman cities on the mission of the German spirit, which he saw as acting as abalance between the opposing forces of Russia on the one hand and Britain andthe United States on the other. At Dornach, many nationalities, including thoseat war with one another, continued to gather and work in harmony. It was nowapparent that the difficulties about building in Munich had been a blessing indisguise.The war was going badly with Germany, and, oddly enough, many blamed Steiner.For a long time Germany had been looking for an excuse to go to war againstRussia, believing that Russian industrial development constituted a long-termmenace to Germany. But when this chance came, with the Serbian problem, theKaiser suddenly became jittery, and it was his wife who was sent in by hisgenerals to tell him to ‘be a man’ and declare war. The generals were convincedthat Germany could not lose. The plan devised by General von Schlieffen involvedhurling all the German forces against the French and smashing them in onetremendous blow, then turning the army against the Russians. Von Moltke—husbandof Steiner's disciple—was Commander-in-Chief. But the Kaiser's jitters hadinfected Moltke; he could not make up his mind whether to take the Schlieffengamble, or play safe and divide his forces. He asked Steiner to go to see him,but it was impossible to arrange a meeting immediately. By the time Steinerarrived at Coblenz on 27 August 1914, the major decisions had been taken, andthe German offensive was already in trouble. As a result of that initial mistakeof von Moltke's, the war turned into a slogging match fought between twoentrenched armies, and the seed of Germany's defeat was planted. Whether Steinercould have given Moltke the advice he needed if they had met three weeks earlieris a matter for speculation. At all events, Moltke made his fatal decisions, wasrelieved of his command, and died two years later. When it was known thatSteiner had been to see him at a crucial moment, he was widely blamed forinterfering where he had no business. The misunderstandings that had so far beenconfined to his doctrines were now directed at his person, and took on a newdimension of malice.Steiner himself evidently felt that the war marked some kind of turning point inthe history of his movement, for he abandoned the idea of the fifth Mysteryplay, and instead concentrated on producing the first complete stage version ofFaust , including the second part. In December 1915, he drilled his amateuractors to speak Austrian dialect in traditional Christmas plays, and revealedthat, under different circumstances, he would have made a successful commercialdirector.According to Steiner's theory of seven-year cycles, 1916 marked a new beginning.He had devoted the last seven years to blending art and Anthroposophy; now, in aworld divided by war, he felt it was time to turn his thoughts to socialquestions, and to the reconstruction of civilization after the war. In a bookcalled Riddles of the Soul (Von Seelenrätsel ) he spoke at length of his teacherBrentano, and in one long footnote, threw off an idea that came to be regardedas one of his major pronouncements: that man's main faculties—thinking, feeling,willing—are carried out through different parts of his physical organism.Thinking involves the head and nervous system, feeling involves the breathingrhythms and circulation of the blood, willing involves the metabolic system—suchas digestion. Thinking is conscious, feeling is semi-conscious—like breathing,which is ‘automatic’, but can still be influenced by the will—while willingbelongs wholly to the realm of the unconscious, like the growing of the nails orhair.When Steiner turned his thought to social reconstruction, he found himselfthinking naturally in this ‘threefold’ terminology. Like the traditionaldivision of man into body and soul, the division of society into Church andState must be an oversimplification. According to Steiner, society shouldconsist of the equivalent of head, circulatory system, and metabolic system. Thehead should be human creativity, the circulatory system should be the politicalgovernment, while the metabolic system should be the economic system. Thesethree he linked with the French revolutionary ideal of Liberty, Equality, andFraternity. The essence of creativity is liberty: creators cannot be equals, oreven brothers; they must stand alone. The business of government should be tomake sure that, as political animals, men are equals. This concept of equalitycannot—obviously—apply to the business community; its purpose should be to aimat fraternity, at producing wealth and goods for the good of the community, notthe individual. The result should be a threefold social order—or commonwealth—inwhich each part preserves its separate identity, yet works harmoniously with theother two.Early in 1917, as it became clear that Russia was drifting towards socialrevolution, a distinguished Anthroposophist, Count Otto Lerchenfeld, a member ofthe Bavarian state council, asked Steiner for his views on social reconstructionafter the war. The two sat together for three days and discussed the idea of the‘threefold commonwealth’, and when Lerchenfeld finally left, he was bubblingwith enthusiasm. With the aid of another Anthroposophist, Count LudwigPolzer-Hoditz, a memorandum was drawn up. The intention was to send it to allthe statesmen of Europe, including the Allies. Polzer-Hoditz passed on thememorandum to his brother, who was the chief councillor of the new emperor, Karlof Austria. Whether Karl read it or not is unknown; at all events, Steiner heardno more of it.This is hardly surprising. What Steiner was offering was, in fact, a form ofanarchism. The state is to have its authority reduced; its main business issimply to ensure that all citizens have equal rights. It has no role to play inthe economy—that is the task of the ‘economic domain’—and none in education,which is the task of the cultural domain. Moreover, the aim of the businessdomain is not to make excessive profits, but simply to supply the goods thateveryone needs. The cultural leaders will fertilize economic life with newideas, and will in turn have their own basic needs taken care of.The idea is inspiring, but the objections are obvious. Throughout history,politicians have been in charge of central government, and have never shown theslightest inclination to see their power reduced—hence those bitter strugglesbetween Church and State in the Middle Ages. Politicians become politiciansbecause they are interested in power. Neither have businessmen ever shown theslightest inclination to devote their talents to the general good and turn theirbacks on the motive of personal enrichment; businessmen become businessmenbecause they are interested in money. As to the ‘guardians of culture’—thinkers,artists, teachers—they have never yet succeeded in exercising any real influenceeither on businessmen or politicians. Steiner's vision of a commonwealth inwhich the artists and thinkers are, quite literally, the head, while businessmenand politicians listen to them respectfully and agree to take a back seat, ischarming and delightful to contemplate, but totally unrealistic. The fate ofSteiner's own memorandum should have taught him what practical politicians thinkof idealistic amateurs.Steiner was undeterred by objections such as these; he dismissed them as thefruit of old-fashioned materialistic thinking. Neither did he regard it as anyobjection that he had no practical plan through which his ideas could beimplemented. He was convinced that the ‘threefold commonwealth’ would come aboutof itself once it was understood by men of good will; in fact, he prophesiedthat it would inevitably come to pass during the next forty years. As far as hewas concerned, the chief problem was simply to make sure that everyone heardabout it. And the publication of his book The Threefold Commonwealth seemed todemonstrate that there was enormous appetite for Steiner's type of idealism; itbecame something of a bestseller, and was translated into many languages. As thewar came to an end, Steiner once again launched himself into feverish activity,lecturing all over Europe, but concentrating most of his attention on Germany.And while a young ex-corporal named Adolf Hitler was inspiring the GermanWorkers’ Party by preaching nationalism and anti-semitism, Steiner was tellinghis own audiences to turn their minds to higher things: ‘Instead of thinkingabout the very next requirements of the moment, a broader conception of lifemust now take place which will strive with strong thinking to comprehend theevolutionary forces of modern humanity…’.Steiner was startled by the bitterness of the opposition he encountered. In theearly years of the century, he had been able to tell the workers that Marxismwas intellectually unsound without arousing too much resentment. But conditionswere now changed; half Germany was starving; the mark was almost valueless.After the Russian revolution, the German communists felt that their moment hadcome, and they were intolerant of half-baked anarchists who felt Utopia wasround the corner. They forbade their members to attend Steiner's meetings. Asfor the Nazis, they were quite determined to see the communists destroyed;Steiner was simply an irrelevance. But when he preached against patriotism, andannounced that his ‘threefold commonwealth’ would gradually erode all nationalboundaries, they began to regard him as a menace. So his meetings wereinterrupted by hecklers. Things came to a climax in May 1922, when Steinerlectured in ten German cities in two weeks. In Munich—Hitler's city—young Naziscontinually interrupted his talk on ‘Anthroposophy and Spiritual Knowledge’.Then, in the Four Seasons Hotel, he was physically attacked, and only the promptintervention of his friends saved him from injury; Steiner had to escapeignominiously by the back door. After that, his lecture agents decided that, forthe time being at any rate, it was too dangerous to book him in Germany.Steiner went on immediately to a West-East conference in Vienna, at which he wasone of the major speakers. Wachsmuth notes: ‘A large part of the press waseither extremely reserved or hostile…’. Steiner was experiencing this reactionmore and more frequently, and it worried him. Wachsmuth mentions his ‘acutedistress’ when an ‘aggressive pastor’ published a pamphlet full of ‘crassfalsehoods’. Wachsmuth himself is obviously baffled that a man of Steiner'ssincerity and benevolence should be so violently attacked, and puts it down tosheer human wickedness. He seems unaware that most people saw Steiner as awoolly-minded crank, full of preposterous ideas borrowed from Madame Blavatsky,and that there was a general feeling that it was time he met his come-uppance.In August 1922, Steiner went to Oxford to speak at an educational conference.Since the end of the war, Steiner had acquired a new reputation as an eminenteducationalist. An Anthroposophist named Emil Molt, who ran the Waldorf-Astoriatobacco factory in Stuttgart, asked Steiner's advice about setting up a schoolfor the children of his workers. Here Steiner was in his element; he was aneducationalist by nature and vocation. Above all, he understood that the task ofthe teacher is to persuade children that they want to be educated—a concept thatwould have struck most Germans as perversely paradoxical. The Waldorf school inStuttgart was an immediate success; within a few years it had eleven hundredpupils, and hundreds of others had to be rejected. So when Steiner lectured atOxford, he was able to stand as an equal among eminent educationalists,including Professor Gilbert Murray; when the Manchester Guardian said that ‘theentire congress finds its central point in the personality and teaching of DrRudolf Steiner’ it meant, of course, his educational theories, not his‘spiritual’ teachings.Back in Dornach in September, another important event took place: the foundingof the ‘Christian Community’. Steiner was presenting a course of lectures fortheologians, and many of those present felt that a new religious impulse wasneeded. Steiner himself had come to recognize that Anthroposophy—the quest for‘spiritual knowledge’—cannot replace the daily practice of religion, with itsrituals and sacraments. It was an important recognition that seemed to mark achange in attitude, for the Steiner of ten years earlier had seemed to feel thatthe new Orphic Mysteries could replace the element of ritual. Now he told theassembled ministers and theologians that if a religious revival was to beachieved, then the bearers of the message would have to be ‘God-inspired’. Itfurnishes additional evidence of Steiner's charismatic personality that many ofthem decided to accept the challenge, and gave up their own pulpits to serve thenew movement. The Christian Community was founded under the leadership ofFriedrich Rittelmeyer; its forty-five priests included a Buddhist scholar andthree women. Steiner provided a sacrament called The Act of Consecration of Man,which Rittelmeyer found deeply moving. There were some members of theAnthroposophical Society who thought that Steiner had now founded anAnthroposophical religion; on 30 December 1922, Steiner had to deliver a lecturethat was, in effect, a mild rebuke. But when the news of the Christian Communitypercolated through to the outer world, it was inevitable that the samemisunderstanding should arise, and Steiner suddenly found that he had a host ofnew enemies within the established Church.The ‘come-uppance’ that his opponents had been hoping for arrived withdisastrous suddenness on New Year's Eve 1922. That evening, Steiner deliveredthe last lecture of a course on the Spiritual Communion of Mankind. Wachsmuthsays: ‘In the great domed hall of the building people listened to his words. Themighty columns also, the forms of their capitals, the paintings of the dome inthe lofty work of art of this most living of all human buildings spoke to themof spiritual action and the sense of sacrifice, of a decade of creative mouldingthrough a human being who was leading towards the spiritual communion ofmankind.’ The deeply moved audience left at about ten o'clock. Soon after, awatchman noticed smoke in the White Hall. No fire could be found, until a wallin the south wing was broken into; it was burning inside. The fire brigadearrived quickly; Anthroposophists rushed into the building to rescue sculpturesand paintings. But by morning, little was left of the Goetheanum but itsconcrete foundations. Most commentators suggest that the fire was due to arson,but the fact that it began inside a wall suggests an electrical fault.Steiner bore the blow with dignity. He was heard to mutter: ‘Much work and manyyears.’ But the next day, he ascended the rostrum in the nearby joinery shop andannounced that the play scheduled for that afternoon would still take place. Andin the evening, Steiner gave a lecture on Science in World History in theworkshop. In the disaster, he had shown himself to be a true leader.The building of a new Goetheanum began immediately; Steiner once again designedit. The new building was made of concrete.The destruction of the Goetheanum seems to have brought to a head Steiner's owninner sense of dissatisfaction; on 23 January 1923, he delivered an address tothe Society that was a powerful rebuke. Anthroposophy, he said, was losing itssense of inner purpose. People had started ‘premature undertakings’ and failedto follow them through. What was needed was a new spirit of dedication. He beganto brood on a new constitution for the Society, and on the reorganization offoreign branches. Then, with all the old nervous energy; he threw himself oncemore into lectures and international travel: Switzerland, Germany,Czechoslovakia, England and Wales, Austria, and Holland. Wachsmuth was greatlyimpressed when Steiner climbed with him to the plateau containing the stonecircle of Penaenmawr, discoursing all the way on the Mysteries of the Druids andof Mithras, and was still apparently unfatigued when they came down again.Steiner's discourse on this occasion is a remarkable example of his genuineinsight into the past. In 1923 very little was known about prehistoric stonecircles, and they were generally assumed to be of ‘Druid’ origin (the Druidsbeing a Celtic priesthood who arrived in England from Europe around 600 BC ). Wenow know that most stone circles predate the Druids by many centuries, some asmuch as two thousand years. Yet in spite of his mistaken assumption about theDruids, Steiner recognized that the circles were basically astronomicalcalculators, and that the stones were somehow aligned with surrounding peaks.He suggested that I look at the peaks of the mountain domes surrounding theplateau, and described to me…how the Druid priests, through viewing the signs ofthe zodiac passing along the horizon in the course of the year experienced thespiritual cosmos…He explained how they determined the consecration of thefestivals and the cults of the year according to these cosmic rhythms, and gavetheir priestly directions to those belonging to their communities; how theoccurrences in the course of the year had to be spiritually mirrored in thecult, and physically even in the carrying out of agricultural labour. He spokeof the experience of sunlight and shadow in the stone chamber of the ancientsacred place, and of the spreading of the visions there received and theirimpulses into the expanses of the earthly environment…More than half a century after Steiner's death, this sounds like sheerinspiration. In Steiner's day, monuments like Stonehenge were assumed to be the‘Druid’ equivalent of churches; it is only in the past decade or so thatunorthodox archaeologists like Professor Alexander Thom and Gerald Hawkins, andunorthodox astronomers like Fred Hoyle, have shown them to be astronomicalcalculators, and that an even more unorthodox fraternity known as ‘ley hunters’have suggested theories of their purpose that are practically identical withSteiner's.This provides an interesting clue to the riddle of Steiner's ‘spiritualinsight’. It was not sufficiently accurate to enable him to distinguish betweena late Neolithic site and an Iron Age site, yet where the actual purpose of thesite is concerned, it seems to go straight to the heart of the matter. Thisseems to confirm the suspicion that arose in connection with his visit toTintagel: that Steiner possessed some deeply intuitive insight into suchmatters, but that when he attempted to bring it into logical—andhistorical—focus he was liable to go hopelessly awry.Steiner's insight into the natural rhythms of the earth formed the basis of hisagricultural theories, whose influence after his death was to be as widespreadas that of his educational theories. Wachsmuth explains how in 1922 Steiner'sfollowers asked him for some practical suggestions about agriculture, and weretold that they must acquire ‘preparations’ out of the realm of plants andanimals, and then expose these ‘in a particular way to the rhythms of the cosmicand earthly forces in summer and winter so that the forces beneficial tolife…might be concentrated and enriched.’ They were told to take cow horns andfill them with various natural substances, then leave them buried in the earthfor the winter. When they were dug up, the preparations were stirred vigorouslyinto water, and the resulting mixture used as a fertilizer. Steiner was stronglyopposed to chemical fertilizers and insecticides, and there can be no doubt thathis ‘biological farming’ methods were based on his ‘spiritual insights’ into thefarming methods of prehistoric man, as well as on Goethe's vision of nature.Steiner's medical insights were equally revolutionary, and just as far ahead oftheir time. His starting point—inevitably—was his Goethean ‘anti-reductionism’.The reductionist theory accepts that the cells of our bodies interact accordingto some more-or-less ‘chemical’ law which governs their reproduction and growth.The anti-reductionist view was expressed by Dr D. W. Smithers when he said thatit was as impossible to deduce the form of a human being from the study of hiscells as to deduce the rules of billiards from the study of individual billiardballs. * [text00012.html#fnr] And at the turn of the century, the biologist HansDriesch argued that living organisms can only be understood as wholes , and thatif they have ‘purpose’ in their growth, then this purpose is something quiteseparate from their mechanical bits and pieces. In the 1930s, two Yaleprofessors, Harold Burr and F. S. C. Northrop, connected delicate voltmeters totrees and discovered regular seasonal variations in their electric fields. Burrwent on to conclude that living cells are held together and ‘arranged’ by thesefields in the same way that iron filings are ‘arranged’ by a magnet. In fact,the life-field (or L-field) is a kind of jelly mould into which the livingmatter is poured. This is, of course, coming very close to Goethe's view thatnature is controlled by spirit.It would follow that, for example, a cancer—which consists of normally healthycells running riot—is due to some kind of breakdown of control of the L-field,and that therefore, in a sense, a cancer is controllable by will (bearing inmind Steiner's insistence that will operates basically on the metabolic level).A pupil of Steiner's named Ita Wegman asked about the application of hisprinciples to medicine, and as a result went on to found the Arlesheim Clinic,based on principles that would now be called ‘holistic’. As with Steiner'seducational theories, the movement has spread until it has become worldwide.Steiner's theories on medicine included important insights into the mentallyill, and these were developed by Dr Friedrich Husemann, who founded the WiesneckSanatorium at Buchenbach. A request for advice about mentally ill children ledto the founding of an Institute for Therapeutic Education at Jena. Steiner'sbelief in reincarnation played an important part in his attitude to handicappedchildren and to mongols; he taught that they had been placed in sick, misshapenbodies or burdened with underdeveloped brains for ‘karmic’ reasons, and that acertain development is possible with love and understanding. His attitude wasbased on his own personal experience with the mentally retarded Otto Specht, whowas totally cured by Steiner's loving care. Steiner also taught that thedoctor's spiritual interaction with the child is of importance for the doctor'sown development. Since Steiner's death, more than a hundred homes forhandicapped children have been founded by Anthroposophists.So at the beginning of 1924—the last full year of his life—Steiner was involvedin a bewildering number of activities: education, medicine, agriculture,politics, the Christian community, Eurhythmy and speech training, as well as inlecturing on all aspects of Anthroposophy. He was also engaged in writing hisAutobiography, one of his most important books, which appeared in weekly partsin the periodical The Goetheanum (edited by Albert Steffen). He was alsobecoming increasingly preoccupied with problems of karma, and at Dornach inFebruary and March, delivered a series of lectures called ‘Esoteric Reflectionson Karmic Relationships’. The eight volumes in which these were published arecertainly among the most fascinating of Steiner's works, even for readers whoare not Anthroposophists. They are far more readable than many of his earlierworks, and have a direct, personal tone which conveys his immense charm. Theyalso reveal his enormous knowledge of history, and the sheer breadth of hisintelligence. Even for the more-or-less sceptical reader, they are a treasurehouse of remarkable insights. In April he was in Prague, in May in Paris, and inJune in Breslau, where he was a guest on the estate of another philosopher,Count Keyserling, and lectured on agriculture. There followed more lectures inStuttgart and Dornach, then a trip to Arnhem, in Holland. Then, after morelectures in Dornach, he attended a summer school in Torquay, Devon. But it wasclear to his associates that he was beginning to find the pace too much for him;he began to suffer from a stomach ailment that often left him exhausted. Insteadof relaxing and taking a holiday, he worked harder than ever: there were seventylectures in two and a half weeks during the Torquay trip.Yet his friends seem to be in agreement that what finally caused Steiner's fatalillness was not the travel and lecturing, but the demands of people, many ofthem strangers. Steffen has described how, after lectures, there would be longqueues of people waiting to talk to him about their personal problems. Nothingcan be more exhausting than listening to other people's problems. It seems clearthat Steiner's major mistake was to make himself available for hundreds of‘personal consultations’ when he was already exhausted from lecturing. And afterleaving Torquay, he went on to London and gave still more lectures. When hereturned to Dornach in September, he was a dying man. On 28 September 1924, hegave what was to be the first of two lectures on St John and the Mystery ofLazarus—he was still lecturing in the workshop, since work on the new Goetheanumhad hardly begun. Members who came to hear the second lecture found itunbelievable that Steiner was unable to deliver it because of illness; they hadcome to think of him as inexhaustible.From late September until his death the following March, Steiner was unable toleave his bedroom. He still continued to work—Wachsmuth brought in hiscorrespondence every day, he dictated replies to letters, and he continued towrite his Autobiography by hand. The festival at Christmas was the first atwhich he had not been present; he sent a message saying that he was present inspirit.He seems to have been unaware that this was the end; he told Marie Steiner (theyhad married in 1914) that he was improving gradually, and that it was imperativethat he should get back to work soon. But his suffering became increasinglyintense. Outside, he could hear the sounds coming from the workshop, and thenoise of the workmen building the new Goetheanum. Then, towards the end of March1925, the pain suddenly ceased, and he became peaceful and relaxed. On 30 Marchhe folded his hands over his breast, closed his eyes, and died.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* [text00012.html#fn] Quoted from Work Arising from the Life of Rudolf Steiner ,edited by John Davy, p. 132."},{"pageContent":"NinePostscript: Steiner's AchievementIT IS easy to see why Anthroposophists regard Steiner as the greatest man of thetwentieth century, and are inclined to dismiss the idea that he was anythingless than perfect. A man who worked so hard and so unselfishly could not be thecharlatan portrayed by his enemies. But for the rest of us, it is rather moredifficult to arrive at an impartial judgement. Beyond all doubt he was noconfidence trickster, no fake messiah driven by an urge to self-aggrandisement.But when we try to arrive at a balanced assessment of what he was , the exercisebecomes increasingly frustrating.The most satisfactory method of approach is to try to grasp the essence ofSteiner's achievement. What did he have to say that distinguishes him from allother thinkers of the twentieth century?The answer lies in that recognition we have discussed at some length in theopening chapter: that the ‘spirit world’ is actually man's inner world. He issaying, in effect: the bird is a creature of the air; the fish is a creature ofthe water; the worm is a creature of the earth. But man is essentially acreature of the mind . His true home is a world inside himself. It is true thatwe have to live in the external world; but, as we saw in the first chapter, wehave to retreat inside ourselves if we are to grasp this outer world.Most of us find it difficult to ‘retreat’ very far into that inner world; theexternal world and its problems keep on dragging us back. Steiner seems to havehad an altogether extraordinary capacity for descending into his inner world.And the central assertion of his philosophy is that this inner realm is the‘spiritual world’, and that once man has learned to enter this realm, herealizes that it is not a mere imaginative reflection of the external world, buta world that possesses its own independent reality.But how is it possible to make use of this insight? Here it is necessary for meto speak from personal experience. I have found that, since I began to immersemyself in the life and ideas of Rudolf Steiner, his ‘central assertion’ hasassumed an increasing importance in my attitude towards my own experience. Mostof us find that life is a struggle between our feeling of personal individualityand the overwhelming reality of the world around us. The world seems so muchbigger and more important than we are. This feeling increases when we are tiredor discouraged; at such times, we feel ‘stranded’ in the external world, like ajelly fish cast up on the beach by the tide. And when this happens, weexperience the profoundly discouraging sensation that the external world is ‘allthere is’—that it is the only reality.Yet we know , deep down, that this is untrue. We only have to be reminded ofthat inner world by some smell or taste, or by a line of poetry or a few bars ofmusic, to experience a strange inner flood of warmth and strength, the feelingProust experienced when he tasted the cake dipped in tea, and which made himwrite: ‘I had ceased to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal…’.Proust devoted his enormous novel to exploring the problem: How can this feelingbe restored at will? Rudolf Steiner had discovered the answer. His early studiesof geometry and science had taught him the ‘trick’ of withdrawing deep insidehimself, until it dawned on him that the inner realm is a world in itself, an‘alternative reality’, so to speak. Once he knew this, he took care not toforget it. He devoted a certain amount of time every day to reminding himself ofthis truth.In effect, Steiner's recognition could be compared to the spray carried aroundby asthma sufferers to ward off attacks. We are all subject to attacks of‘contingency’. The answer lies in developing the trick of reminding oneself ofthe existence of that inner realm.I have found that it is best to do this when I am not actually tired, but merelyrelaxed, or even slightly bored. Most of us experience a certain boredom, asense of ‘taking for granted’, when we are on our way home, because we arelooking forward to getting there, and the interval between now and then seemsrather tiresome. This, I have found, is an excellent time for practisingSteiner's trick of ‘withdrawal’, of reminding myself that this is not ‘all thereis’, but that the entrance to an enormous Aladdin's cave lies just inside thethreshold of my mind.The results of this exercise were more interesting than I expected. I found thatI not only ceased to feel ‘contingent’, but that my powers of endurance seemedto be considerably increased. I have noticed this particularly when walkingalong a very long beach not far from my home, a beach whose soft sand seems toabsorb a great deal of energy. I usually plod along stoically, looking forwardto getting back home and pouring myself a glass of wine. But when practising the‘Steiner exercise’ (as I came to call it), I was suddenly indifferent to theaching in my legs. It no longer mattered .This led to a further insight which I think is worth mentioning. I suspect thatwe quite unconsciously increase our fatigue by the mere act of being aware ofit. If I am on a long walk, and I begin to feel tired, then the mere recognitionthat I am tired induces a kind of ‘negative feedback’. We all know how easilythis can happen when we are feeling thoroughly miserable and discouraged; thesense of discouragement can turn into an avalanche that suddenly overwhelms us.My observations during the ‘Steiner exercise’ made me aware that, quiteunconsciously, we do this all the time, and that merely withdrawing slightlyinto that ‘inner world’ breaks the negative circuit and releases strength thatwas otherwise being allowed to run down a kind of mental drain.I feel that this provides an important clue to Steiner. Looking at the sheervolume of his work—it must run to nearly a million pages—one receives animpression of a cataract of mental energy. As a writer, I am aware of how muchmental energy it takes to write a book. Steiner's mind seems to have been infull flood all the time; it never stopped. In order to form an estimate of thatintellectual Niagara, one merely has to look at the 1,600 pages of KarmicRelationships , delivered between February and September 1924, and to realizethat these were only a fraction of the lectures he delivered in that period.Then glance at any chapter of Wachsmuth's Life , and see how many lectures hedelivered during an average year. One's first reaction is to say: ‘The man neverstopped thinking.’ But all this is not mere ‘thinking’. Thinking is the activitywe find so abundantly in Bertrand Russell, or Karl Marx, or Sartre, an activitythat demands constant pauses for reflection. It seems obvious that Steiner wascarried along by a flood of intuitions. Wachsmuth says repeatedly that whenSteiner spoke about some event in history, he seemed to be seeing what he wasdescribing.To call this ‘active imagination’ sounds slightly derogatory, until one graspswhat Jung actually meant by the term. For Jung, the ‘psychic world’ (i.e. worldof the mind) was an independent reality, and it was possible to travel there andmake the acquaintance of its inhabitants.One of the best examples of ‘active imagination’ is the curious ability known aspsychometry, which was briefly discussed in the opening chapter. Certain peoplehave the ability to hold an object in their hands and to ‘see’ images from itspast history. In recent decades it has even been found to be a valuable aid toarchaeology. A remarkable Polish psychic, Stefan Ossowiecki, was told by afriend about Rudolf Steiner and the ‘Akasic records’, and decided to make asystematic attempt to ‘read’ them. In association with Professor StanislawPoniatowski, of the University of Warsaw, he conducted a detailed series ofexperiments on prehistoric objects that again and again revealed incredibleaccuracy. * [text00013.html#fnr]But all good psychometrists freely admit that they can easily be confused by thethoughts and expectations of other people, or by their own. Most psychometristsinsist on being told nothing whatever about the object they are about to handle,in case this influences what they ‘see’.The evidence suggests that Steiner was a psychometrist of a very highorder—Maeterlinck went straight to the point when he said that Steiner used a‘transcendental psychometry’. Unfortunately, he never undertook a series ofcontrolled experiments, so it is quite impossible for us to know how many of hisvisions of the past were genuine, and how many—like the one at Tintagel—werepartly imagination. Even so it is important to recognize that the Tintagelexperience was not necessarily pure imagination. The Roman general Artorius isassociated with Cornwall, as the large number of Arthurian place names testify.* [text00013.html#fnr1] Nothing is more likely than that there was someassociation between Artorius and the Celtic monastery that occupied the Tintagelsite in Arthur's lifetime. But when Wachsmuth says: ‘He described to us inliving pictures—pointing with his hand to the various parts of the castle—wherethe hall of the Round Table had once been, the rooms of the king and hisknights,’ we are justified in assuming that he was being influenced by hisliterary knowledge of the legend.Where Steiner's real importance is concerned, all this is irrelevant. BernardShaw pointed out that the miracles are irrelevant to the teachings of Jesus. ‘Tosay “You should love your enemies; and to convince you of this I will nowproceed to cure this gentleman of a cataract” would have been…the proposition ofan idiot.’ And Shaw quotes Rousseau as saying: ‘Get rid of the miracles and thewhole world will fall at the feet of Jesus Christ.’ He argues that Jesus did hisbest to keep the miracles quiet because he realized that they would distractattention from what he really had to say. This is undoubtedly why Steinerreserved his lectures on karma and allied ‘occult’ subjects for a small circleof followers; he knew they would only distract attention from his basic teachingon freedom, on the reality of the ‘inner world’, on man's immense hidden powersof creativity.Steiner was not, after all, a man whose claim to attention lay in ‘psychicpowers’ or contact with hidden masters. It lay in the ideas that are to be foundin his books on Goethe, in The Philosophy of Freedom , and in the Autobiography.Steiner claimed that what he was saying in those books was the foundation forhis later ideas. Yet the truth is that we may decide to ignore the later ideas,or to study them in a spirit of purely intellectual curiosity, withoutdetracting in any way from our sense of the importance of these early books.It has been my own experience that, once Steiner's basic ideas are understood,everything else falls into place. Problems only arise if we approach Steinerthrough the ‘esoteric’ teachings that he himself tried to limit to intimatefriends and convinced Anthroposophists. If we begin with Cosmic Memory or KarmicRelationships , the result is likely to be confusion followed by scepticism. Wewant to know how he claims to know all these things, and he offers no clue. Soit is easy to make the assumption that his ‘readings’ from the Akashic recordsare pure invention. If we once conclude that he is dishonest, then it becomesequally plain that the turning point came in 1900, when he decided to swallowthe doctrines of Theosophy to gain an audience—rather as a poor man might marryan ugly but wealthy widow. The next step is to feel that a man who couldcompromise his intellectual honesty to this extent must have been a fraud—or atleast a lightweight—from the beginning.Presumably a person who has arrived at this conclusion would never make theattempt to read the Autobiography or Goethe's Theory of Knowledge . And thiswould be a pity, for these two books, the first and last Steiner wrote, make itimmediately clear that this man was far too serious a thinker to be dismissed inthis way. It would be possible to construct a whole philosophy upon this singlesentence from the Goethe book: ‘When one who has a rich mental life sees athousand things which are nothing to the mentally poor, this shows as clearly assunlight that the content of reality is only the reflection of the content ofour minds, and that we receive from without merely the empty form.’Take this as our starting point, and we begin to see Steiner from a completelydifferent point of view. He was a man who was born into a world dominated byscientific materialism. His objection to this materialism was not merelyintellectual, or even egotistical (the feeling ‘If the world is wholly material,then I can't be very important’). It was the feeling that man is cut off fromhis inner powers by this superficial attitude . This is why Steiner shouted athis friend at the Vienna railway station: ‘Please note that you never say “mybrain thinks”, “my brain sees”, “my brain walks”…The fact is, you are lying whenyou say “I”…’. A man who believes that thinking is merely some chemical activityof the brain will never make the effort to create a masterpiece.The problem is that man is trapped in a vision of himself as a nobody, anonentity. Gurdjieff would have said that this is because so-called wakingconsciousness is actually a disguised form of sleep. Steiner would have put itslightly differently, and said that it is a problem of ‘forgetfulness’. Humanbeings have forgotten that they are free.The different diagnoses lead to different remedies. For Gurdjieff, man needs tobe shaken awake; he needs an ‘alarm clock’. The threat of death, for example,instantly wakes him up. The problem is that the ‘robot’, the mechanical part ofus, tends to do most of our living for us. Gurdjieff's answer was to maintain ahigh level of self-discipline—for example, incredibly complicated physicalmovements—that would suppress the robot. But even this is not a permanentsolution; consciousness is continually falling asleep again.Steiner's answer is, by comparison, far more optimistic. If man has forgottenthat he is free, his problem is simply to remind himself. Like Faust, he needsto remember thatThe spirit world is never closed;Your heart is dead, your senses sleep…To grasp the essence of Steiner, we only need to re-read that opening scene inFaust , where the overworked scholar, depressed and exhausted, feels tempted tocommit suicide. But as he raises the poison to his lips, the Easter Bells beginto ring, bringing back a flood of memories of childhood—the ‘Proust effect’. AndFaust dissolves into tears of happiness, remembering that life is infinitelycomplex and infinitely exciting.Hermann Hesse captured the same vision in his own version of Faust , the novelSteppenwolf . The hero is another bored scholar who suspects that life is amalicious joke. He broods on suicide. Then, as he sits in a tavern, eating hisevening meal with a glass of Moselle, he experiences pure delight: ‘A refreshinglaughter rose in me…It soared aloft like a soap bubble…and then softly burst…Thegolden trail was blazed, and I was reminded of the eternal, and of Mozart andthe stars…’.It is as if the doorway to an inner Aladdin's cave has swung open. He realizesthat human beings possess a sense of reality , a certain faculty that gives usaccess to reality. (I have elsewhere called this ‘Faculty X’.)We can see that the real problem of Faust and Steppenwolf is that they have notonly allowed themselves to forget this ‘other’ reality—Mozart and the stars—butthat they have gone to the other extreme, and constructed a mental vision thatis based on the feeling that life is stupid and futile.How can they combat this negative insight? Gurdjieff would say: by constructingelaborate ‘alarm clocks’ and accepting ‘intentional suffering’. But there isobviously a more straightforward solution. If I really want to remembersomething, then I can do so. I can sit and think about Faust and Proust andSteppenwolf, until my gloom has evaporated and I realize that the ‘negativeinsight’ is a mixture of muddle-headedness and self-pity. If I do this oftenenough, I shall gradually cease to become subject to apathy and discouragement.I shall realize that the objective facts of human existence justify immenseoptimism, and that the main thing that prevents us from grasping this is simplychildishness, a failure to grow up.There was another respect in which Steiner was more optimistic than Gurdjieff.Gurdjieff said that man is deluded to believe he has an ‘essential ego’, a real‘I’. The truth, said Gurdjieff, is that man has hundreds of ‘I's’, and they keepreplacing one another with bewildering rapidity, so man is like a country thathas never known a stable government. Steiner would agree that there is anelement of truth in this, but he would argue that it is not a fundamentalproblem. According to Steiner, the existence of an ‘I’ is precisely whatdistinguishes man from the lower animals. We might compare a dog or cat to agroup of travelling musicians who wander through the streets playing more orless in unison; but man is an orchestra with a conductor. The travelling playersmake a perfectly good job of ‘Home, sweet home’. But only the orchestra can dojustice to Beethoven's ninth symphony.The problem, according to Steiner, is that man continues to behave as if he werea group of travelling musicians; he never attempts anything more ambitious than‘Home, sweet home’. Why? Because the conductor is sitting among the orchestra,smoking a cigarette, unaware that he is the conductor. It is only in certainmoments of excitement or crisis that he remembers who he is, and seizes thebaton. Then the orchestra responds by playing magnificently. If he made thempractise every day, the results would clearly be superb.Again, we can see that it is a problem of forgetfulness rather than ‘sleep’. Ifthe conductor makes a habit of rehearsing twice a day, the problem will vanish.Steiner goes further than this—and this is his own central contribution tomodern thought. He states that once we have made a habit of remembering Mozartand the stars, we shall find ourselves developing powers of ‘spiritual vision’.We shall never again feel ourselves to be helpless victims of the externalworld. At present, man is subject to misery, distress, and mental strain becausehe keeps drifting into a kind of short-sightedness and forgetfulness. Anyserious crisis makes him see how lucky he is, and that the problems thatnormally oppress him are sheer trivialities. He merely has to learn to graspthis so he will never forget it. And, as we all know, it is quite easy to dothis if you tell yourself it really matters. When that is accomplished, saysSteiner, we shall not only cease to be subject to anxiety and fatigue, but willfind ourselves standing on the threshold of a new spiritual world, anddeveloping powers that we never even suspected we possessed.Steiner claims that his own practice of ‘remembering’—of meditating upon thesebasic truths—had the result of developing his own spiritual powers, includingthe power of ‘vision’ possessed by such men as Boehme, Swedenborg, and Blake.These visions, it must be emphasized, were inward occurrences. Swedenborg didnot imagine he saw angels in the streets of Stockholm; he had to withdraw into apeculiar inner state in order to become aware of them. Steiner admits that thisfaculty is a form of imagination, but immediately points out that the generalusage of the word ‘imagination’ gives only the faintest idea of what he means.We might say that, in most of us, the faculty of imagination is like the pictureon some worn out black-and-white television set, continually flickering anddistorting and vanishing; by comparison, Steiner's imagination was like a newcolour television with a large screen. And, according to Steiner, he used thisfaculty to amplify his visions of ‘spiritual reality’.We are now in a position to grasp the real tragedy of Rudolf Steiner. He was oneof the greatest men of the twentieth century, and it would be impossible toexaggerate the importance of what he had to say. But in order to make himselfheard (‘Must I remain silent?’) he had to take the dangerous step of becoming apreacher and a ‘spiritual leader’. This is like hiring a carriage with a dozenpowerful and uncontrollable horses. Even a politician finds it difficult to stopthem from galloping around in circles. A ‘spiritual leader’ is lucky if he canprevent them from taking him in the opposite direction from the one he wants togo in.Shaw expressed the problem with considerable insight in The Perfect Wagnerite .Wotan, the ruler of the gods, symbolizes pure idealism. But in order totranslate his ideals into action, he has to form an alliance with the forces ofthe law, and to seal the bargain, he has to sacrifice one of his eyes. The manof pure genius always has to compromise when he wants to put his ideals intoaction.Steiner's great compromise was to join the Theosophical Society. He can hardlybe blamed for this. He had been an obscure academic, pathetically grateful whena group of working men offered him eight marks for a course of lectures. Then,suddenly, he had an appreciative audience who hung on every word he said. Withina mere decade, his teachings had reached remote corners of the world. TheGoetheanum rose on its hilltop in Dornach, a symbol of the ultimate triumph ofthe spirit. Steiner did what he had to do, and it would be pointless to findfault with him.Yet the Goetheanum is also the symbol of everything that stands between Steinerand his potential modern audience. It is the visible church of Anthroposophy,and its scriptures include Cosmic Memory, Karmic Relationships, Christianity asMystical Fact, Rosicrucian Esotericism, The Reappearance of Christ in theEtheric , and a hundred or so other volumes with confusing titles andbewildering contents. For the Anthroposophist—and even for the open-mindedsceptic—they are full of important insights. But their sheer quantityconstitutes an enormous obstacle between Steiner and the intelligent reader.Steiner's incredible industry was self-defeating. The mountain of titles, theavalanche of ideas, obscures the clarity and simplicity of his basic insight.Nevertheless, for the reader who declines to be discouraged, the rewards can beenormous. Once the basic insight has been grasped, we can begin to understandthe source of those tremendous mental energies, and the sheer breadth ofSteiner's vision. It hardly matters that there is a great deal that we may findunacceptable, or even repellent. What is so absorbing is to be in contact with amind that was capable of this astonishing range of inner experience.Steiner was a man who had discovered an important secret; his books arefascinating because they contain continual glimpses of this secret. We may readthem critically, wondering where Steiner was ‘amplifying’ genuine intuitions,and where he was amplifying his own dreams and imaginings. We may even concludethat Swedenborg, Blake, and Madame Blavatsky had all developed the same power ofamplification, and that Steiner's visions of angelic hierarchies are no truerthan Swedenborg's visions of heaven and hell, Blake's visions of the daughtersof Albion, or Madame Blavatsky's visions of the giants of Atlantis. But all thatis beside the point. The real point is that this faculty of amplification is ourhuman birthright, and that anyone who can grasp this can learn to pass throughthat door to the inner universe as easily as he could stroll through theentrance of the British Museum.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* [text00013.html#fn] See my Psychic Detectives , Chapter 7.* [text00013.html#fn1] See, for example, my contribution to King Arthur Countryin Cornwall (Bossiney Books, 1979)."},{"pageContent":"BibliographyBOOKS ON RUDOLF STEINERRudolf Steiner: Recollections by Some of his Pupils (Golden Blade, 1958).Ahern, Geoffrey, Sun at Midnight.
