And if that is true, then we cannot dismiss all “messiahs” as fakes.Perhaps they are people who sense that human beings possess extraordinarypowers, and realize that the best way to develop them is to try to live the“religious life”, and to persuade as many of their fellow creatures as possibleto do the same thing. There are even cases where the powers of such people seemto live on after their death, as in the odd case of the Deacon of Paris.Saint Joseph of Copertino and the Deacon of Paris demonstrate that miracles canhappen. What seems stranger still is that the “miracle worker” need not be agenuine saint. Grigory Rasputin, the man who has been described as the “evilmessiah” of pre-revolutionary Russia, was a bewildering mixture of saint andsinner.The Day of Judgement According to William MillerOn 22 October 1843, crowds of men and women gathered on a hilltop inMassachusetts, led by their prophet William Miller. In the previous year,Miller, a farmer and an ardent student of the Book of Daniel, had arrived at theconclusion that the end of the world was at hand, and that Christ was about toreturn to earth. One man tied a pair of turkey wings to his shoulders andclimbed a tree to be ready for his ascent into heaven; unfortunately, he felldown and broke his arm. Other disciples carried umbrellas to aid the flight. Onewoman had tied herself to her trunk so that it would accompany her as she sailedupward.[docimages/1.jpg]A Millerite chart of the visions and prophecies of Daniel[docimages/2.jpg]One Millerite met the writer Ralph Waldo Emerson walking with his friendTheodore Parker, and asked them if they did not realize the world was about toend. “That doesn’t affect me,” said Parker, “I live in Boston.”When midnight passed with no sign of Armageddon, the disciples ruefully wenthome. One farmer had given his farm to his son – who was a non-believer, and whonow declined to give it back. Most of the others had sold all they had. In thismoment of depression, Miller suddenly had an inspiration: his calculations hadbeen based on the Christian year, and no doubt he should have used the Jewishyear. That would make the date of Armageddon the following 22 March. On thatdate, his followers once more gathered for the last Trumpet. Still nothinghappened. One man wrote sadly: “Still in the cold world! No deliverance – theLord did not come.”Miller’s 50,000 followers soon dwindled to a small band of “true believers”.Miller himself was not among them; he admitted sorrowfully that he had made hismistake through pride and fanaticism. Another follower made an even morepenetrating comment, which might be regarded as the epitaph of any number of“messiahs”: “We were deluded by mere human influence, which we mistook for theSpirit of God.” Miller died five years later, a deeply chastened man, whorecognized that he had been wasting his time in his biblical calculations. Fewother messiahs have possessed his honesty.In fact, very few had his opportunity, for a large proportion of them have diedignominiously. In 1172, an unnamed prophet from the Yemen was dragged in frontof the Caliph, who demanded proof that he was a messenger from God. “That iseasy,” replied the prophet. “Cut off my head and I shall return to life.” “Thatwould indeed be a sign,” said the Caliph, “and if you can do as you say, I willbecome your follower.” Whereupon he signalled to his headsman. The head of theprophet rolled on the floor, and – predictably – the messiah failed to keep hispromise.[docimages/3.jpg]William Miller, leader of the “Millerites”The word messiah means “anointed” in Hebrew, and refers to the Jewish beliefthat King David will one day return and lead his people to victory. (Christmeans the same thing in Greek.) The prophet Isaiah announced triumphantly that“unto us a child is born”, and that the Messiah would take the “government uponhis shoulders”. Isaiah was writing roughly around 700 BC, after the Assyrianshad conquered Israel and led its people (including the mythical “lost tribes”)into exile. Ever since then, certain men have become possessed of the convictionthat they are the promised Messiah, and ordered their disciples to follow themto victory and kingship. None has so far succeeded.In the first millennium, it was widely believed that the year AD 1000 would markthe end of the world. It failed to materialize, but there was plenty of war andbloodshed – the Crusades, for example – to encourage the believers to feel thatthe end was nigh. The roll-call of those who – like William Miller – haveannounced the end of the world is impressive, as we shall see in this book.Women have also been among these prophets of the new Millennium, and a few haveshown even greater fanaticism than their male counterparts. Perhaps the mostgruesome example is the German prophetess Margaret Peter.***At the Kofuku temple in Nara, Japan, a resentful priest named Kurodo decided toplay an embarrassing trick on his fellow priests. At the side of a pond near thetemple, Kurodo set up a placard that read: “On 3 March, a dragon shall ascendfrom this pond.” The effect was just what he had expected. News of the placardspread far and wide, and people talked of nothing but dragons. On 3 March thepond was surrounded by thousands of people from all the neighbouring provinces.The day was sunny and peaceful. By noon nothing had happened, and the priestswere beginning to feel worried. If no dragon appeared, they would lose face.Suddenly, a cloud drifted across the sky. A wind sprang up. The day becamedarker, and a storm broke. Rain fell in torrents and lightning flashed. BeforeKurodo’s startled eyes, a smoky shape like an enormous black dragon rose out ofthe pond and up into the clouds. This story may or may not be true. It waswritten by the great Japanese author Akutagawa, who probably based it on atradition of the Kofuku temple.***The Crucifixion of Margaret PeterIn the week after Easter 1823, a horrible ceremony took place in a house inWildisbuch, on the German-Swiss border. A twenty-nine-year-old woman namedMargaret Peter, who was regarded as a holy woman by her disciples, announcedthat she had decided that she had to be crucified if Satan was to be defeated.Her sister Elizabeth immediately begged to be allowed to take her place. Todemonstrate her sincerity, she picked up a mallet and struck herself on the headwith it. Margaret then shouted: “It has been revealed to me that Elizabeth shallsacrifice herself,” and she hit her sister on the head with a hammer. Then theremaining ten people in the room – including Margaret’s other brothers andsisters – proceeded to beat Elizabeth with crowbars, hammers and wedges. “Don’tworry,” Margaret shouted, “I will raise her from the dead.” One tremendous blowfinally shattered Elizabeth’s skull.“Now I must die,” Margaret told them. “You must crucify me.” Following hersister’s example, she picked up a hammer and hit herself on the head, thenordered the others to make a cross out of loose floorboards. When it was ready,she sent her sister Susanna downstairs to fetch nails. When Susanna returned,Margaret was lying on the floor on the cross. “Nail me to it,” she ordered.“Don’t be afraid. I will rise in three days.” Two followers obediently nailedher elbows to the cross. The sight of the blood made them hesitate, and one wassick. Margaret encouraged them. “I feel no pain. Go on. Drive a nail through myheart.” They drove nails through both her breasts, and a girl called Ursulatried to drive a knife through her heart. It bent against one of her ribs. Herbrother Conrad, unable to stand the sight any longer, picked up a hammer andsmashed in her skull.The ten remaining disciples then went to eat their midday meal. They wereexhausted but had no doubt that Margaret and Elizabeth would be among them againin three days’ time. The deaths had taken place on Saturday; that meant Margaretand Elizabeth were due to arise on Tuesday.But as the disciples sat around the battered corpses on Tuesday morning, no signof life answered their prayers. Meanwhile, the local pastor, who had heard aboutthe “sacrifice” from another disciple, called in the police. (He had known aboutthe deaths for two days, but felt he had to give Margaret time to make good herpromise.) The disciples were arrested, and taken to prison. They were tried inZurich that December, and were all sentenced to varying prison terms.The Death of Joanna SouthcottSometimes, the prophet – or prophetess – loses faith at the last moment, buteven when that happens, the disciples remain immune to doubt. When the Englishprophetess Joanna Southcott lay on her deathbed in 1814, she suddenly announcedto her dismayed followers that her life’s work now appeared a delusion. AlthoughJoanna was a virgin, she had been convinced that she was about to give birth tothe “child” foretold by Isaiah. And when one of her followers reminded her thatshe was carrying the Messiah (called Shiloh) in her womb, Joanna’s tearssuddenly changed to smiles.After her death a few days later, her followers kept her body warm for threedays as she had instructed them – then summoned a small army of medical men toremove the Christ child from her womb. The smell of putrefying flesh filled theroom as the surgeon made the first incision, and some of the disciples hastilylit pipes to cover the smell. But when the womb was opened there was obviouslyno baby there.“Damn me”, said a doctor, “if the child is not gone.” These words filled thedisciples with new hope. Obviously, he meant that the child had been there, buthad now been transferred to heaven. And even today, there are a small number offollowers of Joanna Southcott – they call themselves the Panacea Society – whobelieve that when her mysterious box is opened – a box supposed to contain hersecret writings – all sin and wickedness in the world will suddenly disappear.It is tempting to dismiss all these prophets and would-be saints as frauds ormadmen. But that would undoubtedly be a mistake. Consider, for example, thestrange case of Joseph of Copertino.***Does a place of worship have more intense thought fields than ordinarybuildings? Can this explain the incredible case of the doll with human hair thatkeeps on growing?The story comes from northern Japan and started in 1938. In that year EikichiSuzuki took a ceramic doll to the temple in the village of Monji-Saiwai Cho forsafekeeping. It had been a treasured possession of his beloved sister Kiku, whohad died nineteen years before at the age of three. Suzuki kept it carefully ina box with the ashes of his dead sister.Suzuki went off to World War II and didn’t return for the doll until 1947. Whenhe opened the box in the presence of the priest, they discovered that the doll’shair had grown down to its shoulders. A skin specialist from the HokkaidoUniversity medical faculty said it was human hair.The doll was placed on the altar, and its hair continued to grow. It is stillgrowing, and is now almost waist length. The temple has become a place ofpilgrimage for worshippers who believe the doll is a spiritual link with Buddha.The priest of Monji-Saiwai Cho thinks that the little girl’s soul somehowcontinues to live through the doll she loved so much.***The Flying MonkGiuseppe Desa was born in Apulia, Italy, in 1603, a strange, sickly boy whobecame kriown as “Open Mouth” because his mouth usually hung open; onecommentator rermarks that “he was not far from what today we should call a stateof feeblemindedness”; a bishop described him as idiota (although the word meantinnocent rather than idiotic). He was subject to “ecstasies” and, even as ateenager, given to ascetic self-torments that undermined his health. At the ageof seventeen he was accepted into the Capuchin order, but dismissed eight monthslater because of total inability to concentrate. Not long after, the order ofConventuals near Copertino accepted him as a stable boy, and at twenty-two hebecame a Franciscan priest. He continued to starve and flagellate himself,acquiring a reputation for holiness. Then one day, in the midst of his prayersafter mass, he floated off the ground and landed on the altar in a state ofecstasy. He was unburned by candle flames, and flew back to his previous place.Sent to see the Pope, he was again seized by such rapture that he rose in theair. His flying fits seem to have been always associated with the state that theHindus called samadhi, ecstasy. His levitations ceased for two years when ahostile superior went out of his way to humiliate and persecute him; but after aholiday in Rome as the guest of the superior of the order, and an enthusiasticreception by the people of Assisi, he regained his good spirits and sailedfifteen yards to embrace the image of the Virgin on the altar.He seems to have been a curious but simple case; floating in the air when in astate of delight seems to have been his sole accomplishment. The ecstasy did nothave to be religious; on one occasion, when shepherds were playing their pipesin church on Christmas Eve, he began to dance for sheer joy, then flew on to thehigh altar, without knocking over any of the burning candles. Oddly enough,Saint Joseph could control his flights. On one occasion, when he had flown pastlamps and ornaments that blocked the way to the altar, his superior called himback, and he flew hack to the place he had vacated. When a fellow monk remarkedon the beauty of the sky, he shrieked and flew to the top of a nearby tree. Hewas also able to lift heavy weights; one story tells of how he raised a woodencross that ten workmen were strugghng to place in position, and flew with it tothe hole that had been prepared for it. He was also able to make others float;he cured a demented nobleman by seizing his hair and flying into the air withhim, remaining there a quarter of an hour, according to his biographer; onanother occasion, he seized a local priest by the hand, and after dancing aroundwith him, they both flew, hand in hand. When on his deathbed, at the age ofsixty, the doctor in attendance observed, as he cauterized a septic leg, thatFather Joseph was floating in the air six inches above the chair. He died sayingthat he could hear the sounds and smell the scents of paradise.What are we to make of such phenomena? It would be convenient if we coulddismiss the whole thing as a pack of lies or as mass hysteria or hypnosis. Wecan certainly dismiss ninety-five per cent of the miracles attributed to thesaints in this way without a twinge of conscience. (A typical example: StDunstan of Glastonbury is reported to have changed the position of the church bypushing it.) But the evidence of Brother Desa’s power of flight cannotautomatically be dismissed; it is overwhelming. His feats were witnessed bykings, dukes and philosophers (or at least one philosopher – Leibnitz). When hiscanonization was suggested, the Church started an investigation into hisflights, and hundreds of depositions were taken. He became a saint a hundred andfour years after his death.***Flying saucer cults exist all around the world. Most hold the view put forwardin Erich von Däniken’s book The Chariots of the Gods?: that the human concept of“God” was created when we were visited by alien beings at some stage in ourpre-history.UFOS reached the public consciousness during the late 1940s. A spate ofsightings seemed to loose a tidal wave of stories involving abduction by aliensand mysterious landings. Throughout the Fifties, pulp science fictionpublications pushed the idea of mysterious alien races that hang around inearth’s upper atmosphere planning our downfall. Strange mutilations of cattle inTexas were ascribed to them. More recently a series of “corn circles”, bizarreasymmetric patterns composed of crushed crops, were said to be produced by theirlandings.Believers in the UFO conspiracy maintain that witnesses to alien activities arevisited by the mysterious Men In Black. These black-suited officials advise thewitness to keep quiet about the sighting. Whether these are aliens in disguiseor agents of government covert operations is not known – perhaps they are both.The spiritual side of saucer cults tends to focus on the higher knowledge ofalien beings conquering famine and war. Some believe that life on earth was“seeded” here millions of years ago by aliens, and that they will soon return tosee how their experiment has gone. This idea actually forms the basis of theobscure but popular film 2001 – A Space Odyssey.***The Miracles of Saint-MédardThe strange events that took place in the little Paris churchyard ofSaint-Médard between 1727 and 1732 sound so incredible, so preposterous, thatthe modern reader is tempted to dismiss them as pure invention. This would be amistake, for an impressive mass of documents, including accounts by doctors,magistrates and other respectable public figures, attests to their genuineness.The miracles undoubtedly took place. But no doctor, philosopher or scientist haseven begun to explain them.They began with the burial of François de Pâris, the Deacon of Paris, in May1727. François was only thirty-seven years old, yet he was revered as a holyman, with powers of healing. He was a follower of Bishop Cornelius Jansen, whotaught that men can be saved only by divine grace, not by their own efforts. TheDeacon had no doubt whatever that his own healing powers came from God.Great crowds followed his coffin, many weeping. It was laid in a tomb behind thehigh altar of Saint-Médard. Then the congregation filed past, laying theirflowers on the corpse. A father supported his son, a cripple, as he leaned overthe coffin. Suddenly, the child went into convulsions; he seemed to be having afit. Several people helped to drag him, writhing, to a quiet corner of thechurch. Suddenly the convulsions stopped. The boy opened his eyes, lookingaround in bewilderment, and then slowly stood up. A look of incredulous joycrossed his face; then to the astonishment of the spectators he began to danceup and down, singing and laughing. His father found it impossible to believe,for the boy was using his withered right leg, which had virtually no muscles.Later it was claimed that the leg had become as strong and normal as the other.The news spread. Within hours cripples, lepers, hunchbacks and blind men wererushing to the church. At first, few “respectable” people believed the storiesof miraculous cures – the majority of the Deacon’s followers were poor people.The rich preferred to leave their spiritual affairs in the hands of the Jesuits,who were more cultivated and worldly. But it soon became clear that ignoranceand credulity could not be used as a blanket explanation for all the stories ofmarvels. Deformed limbs, it was said, were being straightened; hideous growthsand cancers were disappearing without trace; horrible sores and wounds werehealing instantly.The Jesuits declared that the miracles were either a fraud or the work of theDevil; the result was that most of the better-off people in Paris flatly refusedto believe that anything unusual was taking place in the churchyard ofSaint-Médard. But a few men of intellect were drawn by curiosity, and theyinvariably returned from the churchyard profoundly shaken. Sometimes theyrecorded their testimony in print: some, such as one Philippe Hecquet, attemptedto explain the events by natural causes. Others, such as the Benedictine BernardLouis de la Taste, attacked the people who performed the miracles on theologicalgrounds, but were unable to expose any deception or error by them, or any erroron the part of the witnesses. The accumulation of written testimony was suchthat David Hume, one of the greatest eighteenth century philosophers, wrote inAn enquiry concerning human understanding (1758):There surely never was a greater number of miracles ascribed to one person . . .But what is more extraordinary; many of the miracles were immediately provedupon the spot, before judges of unquestioned integrity, attested by witnesses ofcredit and distinction, in a learned age . . . Where shall we find such a numberof circumstances, agreeing to the corroboration of one fact?One of those who investigated happenings was a lawyer named Louis Adrien dePaige. When he told his friend, the magistrate Louis-Basile Carré de Montgéron,what he had seen, the magistrate assured him patronizingly that he had beentaken in by conjuring tricks – the kind of “miracles” performed by tricksters atfairgrounds. But he finally agreed to go with Paige to the churchyard, if onlyfor the pleasure of pointing out how the lawyer had been deceived. They wentthere on the morning of 7 September 1731. And de Montgéron left the churchyard achanged man – he even endured prison rather than deny what he had seen that day.The first thing the magistrate saw when he entered the churchyard was a numberof women writhing on the ground, twisting themselves to the most startlingshapes, sometimes bending backward until the backs of their heads touched theirheels. These ladies were all wearing a long cloth undergarment that fastenedaround the ankles. Paige explained that this was now obligatory for all womenwho wished to avail themselves of the Deacon’s miraculous powers. In the earlydays, when women had stood on their heads or bent their bodies convulsively,prurient young men had begun to frequent the churchyard to view the spectacle.However, there was no lack of male devotees of the deceased Abbé to assist inthe activities of the churchyard. Montgéron was shocked to see that some of thewomen and girls were being sadistically beaten – at least, that is what at firstappeared to be going on. Men were striking them with heavy pieces of wood andiron. Other women lay on the ground, apparently crushed under immensely heavyweights. One girl was naked to the waist: a man was gripping her nipples with apair of iron tongs and twisting them violently. Paige explained that none ofthese women felt any pain; on the contrary, many begged for more blows. And anincredible number of them were cured of deformities or diseases by this violenttreatment.In another part of the churchyard, they saw an attractive pink-cheeked girl ofabout nineteen, who was sitting at a trestle table and eating. That seemednormal enough until Montgéron looked more closely at the food on the plate, andrealized from its appearance as well as from the smell that reached him that itwas human excrement. In between mouthfuls of this sickening fare she drank ayellow liquid, which Paige explained was urine. The girl had come to thechurchyard to be cured of what we would now call a neurosis: she had to wash herhands hundreds of times a day, and was so fastidious about her food that shewould taste nothing that had been touched by another human hand. The Deacon hadindeed cured her. Within days she was eating excrement and drinking urine, anddid so with every sign of enjoyment. Such cases might not be remarkable inasylums; but what was more extraordinary – indeed, preposterous – was that afterone of these meals she opened her mouth as if to be sick and milk came pouringout. Monsieur Paige had collected a cupful; it was apparently perfectly ordinarycow’s milk.After staggering away from the eater of excrement, Montgéron had to endure aworse ordeal. In another part of the churchyard, a number of women hadvolunteered to cleanse suppurating wounds and boils by sucking them clean.Trying hard to prevent himself vomiting, Montgéron watched as someone unwound adirty bandage from the leg of a small girl; the smell was horrible. The leg wasa festering mass of sores, some so deep that the bone was visible. The woman whohad volunteered to clean it was one of the convulsionnaires – she had beenmiraculously cured and converted by her bodily contortions, and God had nowchosen her to demonstrate how easily human beings’ disgust can be overcome. Yeteven she blenched as she saw and smelt the gangrened leg. She cast her eyes upto heaven, prayed silently for a moment, then bent her head and began to lap,swallowing the septic matter. When she moved her face farther down the child’sleg Montgéron could see that the wound was now clean. Paige assured him that thegirl would almost certainly be cured when the treatment was complete.What Montgéron saw next finally shattered his resistance and convinced him thathe was witnessing something of profound significance. A sixteen-year-old girlnamed Gabrielle Moler had arrived, and the interest she excited made Montgéronaware that, even among this crowd of miraculous freaks, she was a celebrity. Sheremoved her cloak and lay on the ground, her skirt modestly round her ankles.Four men, each holding a pointed iron bar, stood over her. When the girl smiledat them they lunged down at her, driving their rods into her stomach. Montgéronhad to be restrained from interfering as the rods went through the girl’s dressand into her stomach. He looked for signs of blood staining her dress. But nonecame, and the girl looked calm and serene. Next the bars were jarrred under herchin, forcing her head back. It seemed inevitable that they would penetratethrough to her mouth; yet when the points were removed the flesh was unbroken.The men took up sharp-edged shovels, placed them against a breast, and thenpushed with all their might; the girl went on smiling gently. The breast,trapped between shovels, should have been cut off, but it seemed impervious tothe assault. Then the cutting edge of a shovel was placed against her throat,and the man wielding it did his best to cut off her head; he did not seem to beable even to dent her neck.Dazed, Montgéron watched as the girl was beaten with a great iron truncheonshaped like a pestle. A stone weighing half a hundredweight (25 kilograms) wasraised ahove her body and dropped repeatedly from a height of several feet.Finally, Montgéron watched her kneel in front of a blazing fire, and plunge herhead into it. He could feel the heat from where he stood; yet her hair andeyebrows were not even singed. When she picked up a blazing chunk of coal andproceeded to eat it Montgéron could stand no more and left.But he went back repeatedly, until he had enough materials for the first volumeof an amazing book. He presented it to the king, Louis XV, who was so shockedand indignant that he had Montgéron thrown into prison. Yet Montgéron felt hehad to “bear witness”, and was to publish two more volumes following hisrelease, full of precise scientific testimony concerning the miracles.In the year following Montgéron’s imprisonment, 1732, the Paris authoritiesdecided that the scandal was becoming unbearable and closed down the churchyard.But the convulsionnaires had discovered that they could perform their miraclesanywhere, and they continued for many years. A hardened sceptic, the scientistLa Condamine, was as startled as Montgéron when, in 1759, he watched a girlnamed Sister Françoise being crucified on a wooden cross, nailed by the handsand feet over a period of several hours, and stabbed in the side with a spear.He noticed that all this obviously hurt the girl, and her wounds bled when thenails were removed; but she seemed none the worse for an ordeal that would havekilled most people.So what can we say of the miracles from the standpoint of the twentieth century?Some writers believe it was a kind of self-hypnosis. But while this couldexplain the excrement-eater and the woman who sucked festering wounds, it isless plausible in explaining Gabrielle Moler’s feats of endurance. These remindus rather of descriptions of ceremonies of dervishes and fakirs: for example, J.G. Bennett in his autobiography Witness describes watching a dervish ritual inwhich a razor-sharp sword was placed across the belly of a naked man, and twoheavy men jumped up and down on it – all without even marking the flesh. Whatseems to be at work here is some power of “mind over matter”, deeper than merehypnosis, which is not yet understood but obviously merits serious attention.It would be absurd to stop looking for scientific explanations of the miraclesof Saint-Médard. But let us not in the meantime deceive ourselves by acceptingsuperficial “sceptical” explanations.A Miraculous CureJosephine Hoare, a healthy girl of twenty-one, had been married for only sixmonths when she developed chronic nephritis, a serious inflammation of thekidneys. Her family was told that she had no more than two years to live. At hermother’s suggestion, she was taken to Lourdes.At the famous French shrine, Josephine braved the icy waters of the spring.Although she felt peaceful, she was not conscious of any change. When she wenthome, however, her doctor said in amazement that the disorder seemed to havecleared. Her swollen legs returned to normal size, her blood pressure becamenormal, and her energy increased. But she was warned that pregnancy wouldcertainly cause a relapse.Several years passed. Then Josephine and her husband had the opportunity torevisit Lourdes; and Josephine lit a candle of thanksgiving. Soon after they gothome she felt a sharp pain in her back. Fearful that nephritis was recurring,she went to her doctor. His diagnosis was simply that she was six monthspregnant – and she had had no relapse.Josephine Hoare had her baby, a son, and remained in good health. For her andher family, the spring of Lourdes had produced a double miracle.Search for a Missing BoyIn 1933 a six-year-old boy vanished from his home in Miège in the Swiss Alps.After an unsuccessful search for the boy, the town’s mayor wrote to Abbé Mermet,who had often assisted police in locating missing people. The Abbé needed anarticle used by the missing person, a description of the last place he or shewas seen, and a map of the surrounding area to do his work. He used a pendulumand a form of dowsing to find the missing person.After the Abbé applied his pendulum to the problem of the missing boy, hereported that the child had been carried away into the mountains by a large birdof prey, probably an eagle. He also said that the bird – although enormous – haddropped its load twice to rest and regain its strength.There was no trace of the boy at the first place the Abbé indicated. A recentheavy snowfall prevented a thorough search at the second place, but theconclusion was that Abbé Mermet had made a mistake.When the snow melted two weeks later, however; a gang of woodcutters found thetorn and mangled body of a small boy. It was the missing child. The bird hadapparently been prevented from completely savaging the child’s body by thesudden heavy storm that had also hidden the forlorn evidence.Scientific investigation established that the boy’s shoes and clothes had notcome into contact with the ground where the body was found. He could only havereached the remote spot by air – the pitiful victim of the bird of prey. Laterthe boy’s father apologized to the Abbé for having doubted him.***Some groups believe that the Great Pyramid in Egypt had encoded within itsmeasurements many great truths. Christian sects have maintained that it was notthe Egyptians who built it at all but the Israelites. According to this theorythe internal passageways of the Pyramid, measured in the correct units, are athree-dimensional model of the history of the world up to Christ’s birth. On amore secular level, twice the length of the base of the Pyramid divided by itsheight, again in the correct units, is supposed to approximate to pi. It isdifficult to verify these statements as the nature of the correct units is amatter of conjecture, and the actual size of the Pyramid in any units is stillproblematic.The Anglo-Israelite fundamentalist sect took the argument a stage further. Notonly was the Pyramid not built by the Egyptians; it was also not entirelycorrect to say the Israelites built it. According to the Anglo-Israelites, theAnglo-Saxon races of Britain and America were the only true tribe of Israelremaining. It was they who had built the Pyramid, as a warning that the worldwould end and that Christ would return on 20 August 1953. When the date passedwithout significant upheaval, the Anglo-Israelites began to formulate the theorythat the message of the Pyramid was not literal, but a religious metaphor. . .***Rasputin, “the Holy Sinner”Grigory Rasputin’s body was taken from the frozen river Neva, in Petrograd, on 1January 1917. He had been murdered three days before, and was one of the mostnotorious figures in Russia. Now that he was dead, he would become a legend allover the world – a symbol of evil, cunning, and lust. If ever you see a magazinestory entitled “Rasputin, the Mad Monk”, you can be sure it will be full oflurid details of how Rasputin spent his days in drunken carousing, his nights insexual debauchery; how he deceived the Tsar and Tsarina into thinking he was amiracle worker; how he was the evil genius who brought about the RussianRevolution and the downfall of the Romanov dynasty. It is all untrue. Yet itmakes such a good story that there is little chance that Rasputin will everreceive justice. The truth about him is that he really was a miracle worker anda man of strange powers. He was certainly no saint – very few magicians are –and tales of his heavy drinking and sexual prowess are undoubtedly based onfact. But he was no diabolical schemer.Rasputin was born in the village of Pokrovskoe in 1870. His father was a fairlywell-to-do peasant. As a young man, Rasputin had a reputation for wildness untilhe visited a monastery and spent four months there in prayer and meditation. Forthe remainder of his life, he was obsessed by religion. He married at nineteenand became a prosperous carter. Then the call came again; he left his family andtook to the road as a kind of wandering monk. When eventually he returned, hewas a changed man, exuding an extraordinarily powerful magnetism. The youngpeople of his village were fascinated by him. He converted one room in his houseinto a church, and it was always full. The local priest became envious of hisfollowing, however, and Rasputin was forced to leave home again.Rasputin had always possessed the gift of second sight. One day during hischildhood, this gift had revealed to him the identity of a peasant who hadstolen a horse and hidden it in a barn. Now, on his second round of travels, healso began to develop extraordinary healing powers. He would kneel by the bedsof the sick and pray; then he would lay hands on them, and cure many of them.When he came to St Petersburg, probably late in 1903, he already had areputation as a wonder worker. Soon he was accepted in aristocratic society inspite of his rough peasant manners.It was in 1907 that he suddenly became the power behind the throne. Three yearsbefore, Tsarina Alexandra had given birth to a longed-for heir to the throne,Prince Alexei. But it was soon apparent that Alexei had inherited haemophilia, adisease that prevents the blood from clotting, and from which a victim may bleedto death even with a small cut. At the age of three the prince fell and bruisedhimself so severely that an internal haemorrhage developed. He lay in a feverfor days, and doctors despaired of his life. Then the Tsarina recalled the manof God she had met two years earlier, and sent for Rasputin. As soon as he camein he said calmly: “Do not worry the child. He will be all right.” He laid hishand on the boy’s forehead sat down on the edge of the bed, and began to talk tohim in a quiet voice. Then he knelt and prayed. In a few minutes the boy was ina deep and peaceful sleep, and the crisis was over.Henceforward the Tsarina felt a powerful emotional dependence on Rasputin – adependence nourished by the thinly veiled hostility with which Alexandra, aGerman, was treated at court. Rasputin’s homely strength brought her a feelingof security. The Tsar also began to confide in Rasputin, who became a man ofinfluence at court. Nicholas II was a poor ruler, not so much cruel as weak, andtoo indecisive to stem the rising tide of social discontent. His opponents beganto believe that Rasputin was responsible for some of the Tsar’s reactionarypolicies, and a host of powerful enemies began to gather. On several occasionsthe Tsar had to give way to the pressure and order Rasputin to leave the city.On one such occasion, the young prince fell and hurt himself again. For severaldays he tossed in agony, until he seemed too weak to survive. The Tsarinadispatched a telegram to Rasputin, and he telegraphed back: “The illness is notas dangerous as it seems.” From the moment it was received, the prince began torecover.World War I brought political revolution and military catastrophe to Russia. Itsoutbreak was marked by a strange coincidence: Rasputin was stabbed by a madwomanat precisely the same moment as the Archduke Franz Ferdinand was shot atSarajevo. Rasputin hated war, and might have been able to dissuade the Tsar fromleading Russia into the conflict. But he was in bed recovering from his stabwound when the moment of decision came.Rasputin’s end was planned by conspirators in the last days of 1916. He waslured to a cellar by Prince Felix Yussupov, a man he trusted. After feeding himpoisoned cakes, Yussupov shot him in the back; then Rasputin was beaten with aniron bar. Such was his immense vitality that he was still alive when themurderers dropped him through the hole in the ice into the Neva. Among hispapers was found a strange testament addressed to the Tsar. It stated that hehad a strong feeling he would die by violence before 1 January 1917, and that ifhe were killed by peasants, the Tsar would reign for many years to come; but, ifhe were killed by aristocrats – as he was – then “none of your children orrelations will remain alive for more than two years”. He was right. The Tsar andhis family were all murdered in July 1918 – an amazing example, among many, ofRasputin’s gift of precognition.The lesson is simple: many messiahs are deluded, but it would be a mistake todismiss them all as madmen.***It was November 1971 in London on a day like any other. In one of the city’sunderground stations, a train was approaching the platform. Suddenly a young manhurled himself directly into the path of the moving train. The horrified driverslammed on the brakes, certain that there was no way to stop the train beforethe man was crushed under the wheels. But miraculously the train did stop. Thefirst carriage had to be jacked up to remove the badly injured man, but thewheels had not passed over him and he survived.The young man turned out to be a gifted architect who was recovering from anervous breakdown. His amazing rescue from death was based on coincidence. Forthe investigation of the accident revealed that the train had not stoppedbecause of the driver’s hasty braking. Seconds before, acting on an impulse andcompletely unaware of the man about to throw himself on the tracks, a passengerhad pulled down the emergency handle, which automatically applies the brakes ofthe train. The passenger had no particular reason for doing so. In fact, theTransport Authority considered prosecuting him on the grounds that he had had noreasonable cause for using the emergency system!***"},{"pageContent":" Chapter TwoWaiting for the Warrior-KingAlthough many of the great mystics spent their lives as members of the Church,they did not believe that the Church was essential for “salvation”. Man can knowGod directly, without the need for priests and sacraments. Some of them – likethe thirteenth-century mystic Meister Eckhart – came dangerously close to beingexcommunicated, or even burned at the stake. (Eckhart was tried for heresy butdied before he was condemned – which he was.)It was only one step from this belief that man has direct access to God, to thebelief that there is no such thing as sin. If man is truly free, then he haschoice, and if he chooses to reject the idea that something is sinful – forexample, sexual promiscuity or incest – no authority has a right to tell him heis a sinner. Preachers of this doctrine were known as Brethren of the FreeSpirit.Was Jesus a Messiah?The answer to that question may seem obvious, for his followers certainlyregarded him as the Messiah. But did Jesus agree with them? The answer is:probably not. When his disciple Peter told him: “They call you the Christ, theMessiah,” Jesus advised him to be silent. The claim obviously embarrassed him.Why? Because, as we have seen, the Jewish craving for a messiah arose out of thelonging for someone to lead them to victory. After the Assyrian invasion, theJews became a conquered people, oppressed by a series of more powerful nations:the Seleucids (descendants of Alexander the Great), the Babylonians, theEgyptians, the Romans. For the same reason, the British of a thousand yearslater came to believe firmly that King Arthur would return to throw off theforeign yoke. Jesus had no desire to be regarded as a military commander, whichis what the word messiah originally implied.What is difficult for modern Christians to grasp is that Jesus was only one ofmany Hebrew prophets who were believed to be the Messiah; the historian Josephusmentions several of them. He regarded them all as charlatans and agitators.Christians later changed Josephus’s text, in which Jesus is described as a smallman with a hunched back and a half-bald head, to read: “six feet tall, wellgrown, with a venerable face, handsome nose . . . curly hair the colour ofunripe hazel nuts . . .”, and various other details that transform theunprepossessing little man into the early Christian equivalent of a film star.So all the writings about Jesus have to be treated with great caution; the laterChristians were quite unscrupulous in changing anything that disagreed withtheir own image of “the Messiah”.But if Jesus declined to be regarded as a military leader, why did anyone payany attention to him? The answer is that he announced that the end of the worldwas about to take place, and that this would happen within the lifetime ofpeople then alive. This is why he told them to take no thought for the morrow,and that God would provide. The world would soon be ending.It is also important to understand that it was the Jews themselves, not theirRoman conquerors, who disliked Jesus. The Sadducees, who loved Greek culture anddisbelieved in life after death, thought him an uncultivated fanatic. ThePharisees, who regarded themselves as the guardians of the Law, reacted angrilyto Jesus’s attacks on them as narrow-minded and old-fashioned. The Zealotswanted to see the Romans conquered and thrown out of Palestine, and had nopatience with a messiah who preached peace and love. While Jesus was wanderingaround the countryside preaching in the open air, no one worried about him. Butwhen he rode into Jerusalem on a donkey (fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah) andwas greeted with enthusiasm by the people, the Jewish establishment becamealarmed. And when Jesus threw the money changers out of the temple, they saw thewriting on the wall and had him arrested. The arrest had to take place in agarden at night to avoid causing trouble.Of the four Gospels, only one, that of John, claims to be that of an eyewitness.When Jesus is taken before Caiaphas, the high priest asks him about histeachings, and Jesus tells him to ask those who have heard him – to theindignation of the high priest’s servant, who slaps his face and tells him notto be impertinent. It is in the other three Gospels – by writers who do notclaim to have known him – that Jesus answers the question about whether he isthe son of God by replying that he is “Son of Man” who will sit on the righthand of God.In John’s account, Pilate asks him if he is the king of the Jews, and Jesusreplies that his kingdom is not of this world – meaning, in effect, that Pilateshould not imagine he is claiming any political leadership. “I have come intothe world to bear witness to the truth.” There is certainly nothing here aboutclaiming to be the Messiah.To Pilate’s disgust, the Jews then demanded Jesus’s execution, declining toallow him to be pardoned in honour of Passover. And so Jesus died, like so manyother messiahs and political agitators, by crucifixion.How, then, did Christianity go on to conquer the world? The answer lies partlyin the many stories of miracles that circulated about Jesus – including thestory that he had risen from the dead. A Jewish sect called the Messianists (orNasoraeans) believed that Jesus would return and lead them against the Romans.At this point, a convert to Christianity named Paul produced a strange andmystical new version of Jesus’s teaching that seemed to have very little to dowith anything Jesus had actually said. Paul declared that Jesus was the Son ofGod (which Jesus had denied) who had been sent to redeem Man from the sin ofAdam, and that anyone who believed in Jesus was “saved”. In fact, Jesus hadpreached salvation through the efforts of the individual, and insisted that theKingdom of God is within everybody. But since there was still a widespreadbelief that the End of the World would occur within a year or so, Paul’s versionof the Christian message was a powerful incentive to belief. The Messianistsregarded such a notion as absurd and blasphemous, and since they werepolitically stronger than Paul’s Christians, it looked as if their version wouldtriumph.However, as it happened, the Messianists were among those wiped out by Titus,the son of the Roman emperor Vespasian, who was sent to put down the latestrebellion. He did more than that; he destroyed the Temple and carried itstreasures back to Rome. Paul’s “Christians” were so widely scattered that theywere relatively immune from massacre. And so, by a historical accident, Paul’sversion of Christianity became the official version, and the “vicariousatonement” – the notion that Jesus died on the cross to redeem man from the sinof Adam – became the basis of the religion that went on to conquer the world.By the year AD 100 it was obvious that the world was not going to end within thelifetime of Jesus’s contemporaries, and that Jesus, like so many other messiahs,had quite simply been wrong. But by that time, Christianity was too powerful todie out. It was now a political force, the focus of all the dissatisfaction ofthe underdogs and victims of Roman brutality. The belief now spread that the endof the world would occur in the year AD 1000. And, as we have seen, there was somuch violence, pestilence and bloodshed around that time that the believers hadno doubt that the end was just around the corner.Simon Bar KochbaBut even before the millennium, there were plenty of messiahs. In AD 132, aJewish revolutionary named Simon Bar Kochba led a revolt against the Romans inJudaea when he learned that the Emperor Hadrian intended to build a templededicated to Jupiter on the site of the temple that had been destroyed by Titus.A celebrated student of the Talmud (the Jewish book of law), Rabbi Akiva, toldSimon Bar Kochba: “You are the messiah.” And Bar Kochba behaved exactly as aJewish messiah was expected to behave (and as Jesus had failed to behave); heseized towns and villages from the Romans, had his own head stamped on thecoinage, and built fortresses. But he stood no real chance against the Romans,with their highly trained troops. It took Julius Severus three and a half yearsto destroy the rebels, and in that time he destroyed fifty fortresses and 985villages, and killed over half a million people. Since Bar Kochba’s men wereguerrillas, and guerrillas survive by being supported by sympathizers, Severusset out to kill all the sympathizers. He finlly killed Bar Kochba himself in thefortress of Bethar, and renamed Jerusalem Aelia Capitolana. So one more messiahwas proved to be mortal after all. The Jews were so shattered by this defeatthat there were no more Jewish messiahs for many centuries.Moses of CreteIn about AD 435, an unnamed messiah from Crete, who called himself Moses,announced that, like his predecessor, he would lead his followers back to thePromised Land, causing the sea to part for them so they could walk on thebottom. Hundreds of followers gathered on the seashore, and Moses raised hisarms and ordered the sea to separate. Then he shouted the order to march intothe waves. They obeyed him, but the sea ignored his order, and many of hisfollowers were drowned. Moses may have been drowned with them; at all events, hedisappeared.The Christ of GevaudonIn AD 591, an unnamed messiah began to wander around France. This man hadapparently had a nervous breakdown after being surrounded by a swarm of flies ina forest; he recovered after two years and became a preacher, clad himself inanimal skins, and wandered down through Arles to the district of Gevaudon in theCevennes (noted later for a famous case of a werewolf). He declared he wasChrist, had a companion called Mary, and healed the sick by touching them. (Aswe have seen in the case of Rasputin, this may be a natural gift.) His followerswere mostly the very poor, and they often waylaid travellers (most of whom wouldbe rich) and seized their money. The messiah redistributed it to the poor. Hisarmy of 3,000 became so powerful that most towns lost no time in acknowledginghim as the Christ.Before he arrived at the cathedral city of La Puy he quartered his army inneighbouring halls and churches, and sent messengers to announce his coming toBishop Aurelius. When these messengers appeared in front of the bishop starknaked and turned somersaults, he decided it was time to end the career of thisdangerous and disrespectful rebel. He sent his men to meet him, apparently towelcome him, and as one of them bowed down as if to kiss the messiah’s knees,they grabbed him and dragged him to the ground, his companions rushed forwardand hacked the messiah to pieces. With their “Christ” dead, the rebelliousfollowers soon dispersed. Mary was apparently tortured until she revealed the“diabolic devices” that had given the messiah his power – St Gregory of Tours,who recounts the story, naturally assumed that it was all the Devil’s work. Buthe also records that the messiah’s followers continued to believe in him to theday they died, and to maintain that he was the Christ.A century and a half later, about 742, a messiah called Aldebert, who came fromSoissons, announced that he was a saint; his followers built chapels for himwhich he named after himself. He claimed to own a letter from Jesus himself.Pope Zachary was so worried about “Saint” Aldebert’s influence that he triedhard to capture him, and, when that failed, excommunicated him. Aldebert went onfor at least two more years, and seems to have died of natural causes.***The inhabitants of the Melanesian islands in the Pacific have, since their firstcontact with Western travellers, developed the so-called “cargo cults”. Cargorefers in the islanders’ pidgin to goods of any kind given by visitors.First contact occurred with the arrival of the Russian Count NikolaiMikiouho-Maclay in 1871. He was received as a god, due to the incredible natureof his transport, a Russian frigate, and his gifts, which were amazing to aculture that was still in the Stone Age. German traders and Christianmissionaries only served to reinforce the natives’ awe and faith. The basictenets of the religion became set: visitors who give “cargo” are good, those whodo not are evil, as they withhold what are seen as spiritual gifts.In 1940 the Americans built a military base on the Melanesian island of Tanna inthe southern Hebrides. Cargo planes zoomed in and out leaving radios, cannedbeer and other Western necessities. The natives observed the American servicemen in uniform; and wishing to bring more planes and enjoy similar luxuries theyimprovised uniforms and spoke into empty beer cans, as they had seen theAmericans speak into microphones.What began as adoration and emulation soon turned to dissatisfaction as theirrituals failed to get the desired response. The faith changed its nature,becoming a conviction that the present Western presence on the island was of thewrong kind. Soon a messiah would come to give the natives what the Americansrefused to give them. John Frum or Jonfrum was the name that the natives gavethis messiah, although the reason is not clear. Some say that Frum is acorruption of broom, to sweep away the white man. Others put forward the simplerexplanation that the name is derived from “John from America”. He is describedas a small man with bleached hair, a high-pitched voice and a coat with shinybuttons.The cult persists in many different forms on each of the remote Melanesianislands. What began as simple worship of Westerners has developed into an entireliberation theology in a very short time: John Frum will one day arrive and handover all of the “cargo” to the natives, while getting rid of the Westerners.After that the islanders would live on as normal, only richer and happier thanbefore.***Eudo de StellaThree centuries later, another messiah called Eon or Eudo de Stella was lesslucky. He gathered hordes of disciples in Brittany, and organized his followersinto a Church with archbishops and bishops. Unlike Jesus of Nazareth, he had nohesitation in declaring that he was the son of God. AD 1144 was a good year fora messiah to acquire followers, for an appalling winter caused multitudes tostarve. Eon’s followers lived in the forest, and ravaged the countryside, livingmainly by plunder. But in 1148, he was finally taken prisoner by soldiers of theArchbishop of Rouen, and imprisoned in a tower, where he was starved to death.His followers refused to renounce him, and the “bishops” and “archbishops” wereburned alive in the now traditional Christian spirit.TanchelmOne of the most remarkable messiahs of the twelfth century, Tanchelm of Antwerp,was already dead by then. He seems to have started his career as a monk, thenbecome a diplomat working for Count Robert of Flanders, trying to persuade thePope to hand over some of Utrecht to Count Robert. The Pope refused, and whenCount Robert died, Tanchelm’s career as a diplomat came to an end. He became awandering preacher, making his headquarters in Antwerp.Tanchelm seems to have possessed what all messiahs possess: tremendous powers asa preacher and orator. We also have to remember that a large part of hisaudience would be ignorant peasants who had never heard a really good preacher.As Tanchelm addressed them in the open fields, dressed as a monk, the audiencesreacted like modern teenagers to a pop idol. He denounced the Church for itscorruption, and told them that if the sacraments were administered by sinfulpriests, they would fail to work. So many were convinced that the churches weresoon empty. And when Tanchelm told his followers not to pay taxes to the church(called tithes), they were delighted to follow his advice.Was Tanchelm a charlatan, or did he really believe he was a messiah? Hecertainly felt that he had a right to live like a king. He dressedmagnificently, and was always surrounded by a large retinue, including twelvemen who were supposed to be the twelve disciples. One day he announced that hewould become betrothed to the Virgin Mary, and held a ceremony in which he and asacred statue were joined together in front of a vast crowd who offered theirjewellery as an engagement present.With so many followers, the Church could do nothing about him; he held Utrecht,Antwerp and large areas of the countryside. Finally, about AD 1115, he waskilled – like the messiah of Gevaudon – by treachery, being stabbed by a priestwho had been allowed to approach him. But his influence remained as powerful asever, and it took another “miracle worker”, Norbert of Xanten (who was regardedwith favour by the Church) to finally “de-convert” his followers in Antwerp andrestore power to the Church.Rebellion, Mysticism and SexHow did these “messiahs” become so powerful? To begin with, all of them had thegift of preaching. But it was more than that. The Christian Church, which beganas a poor and persecuted organization whose leaders were thrown to the lions,suddenly became the official religion of Rome in AD 313, under the EmperorConstantine. As soon as they gained power, the Christians began to behave farworse than their enemies, destroying pagan temples, burning heretics, andsquabbling amongst themselves. In effect, the Church became the supremedictator. And the poor, ordered to go to church every Sunday, groaning underheavy taxes and forced to pay to have their sins forgiven, became increasinglydisenchanted with their spiritual masters. But there was nothing they could do;the Church exerted the same iron grip as the Nazis in Germany or the Communistsin Stalin’s Russia.This is why rebel messiahs found an eager audience. Like Jesus, they attackedthe establishment and declared that the “law” was less important than thespirit. Besides there had always been a strong tradition of mysticism in theChurch. Mystics were men who had experienced moments of overwhelming joy andillumination in which they felt they had seen God. The mystics taught that everyman has a divine spark, and that therefore, in a sense, every man is God – orcontains a fragment of God. They also believed that all Nature is an expressionof God – in fact some (called Pantheists) believed that Nature is God. One ofthe greatest of the early mystics, Dionysius the Areopagite (around AD 500)taught that God is a kind of emptiness or darkness, and can only be reached byrecognizing that God is not knowledge or power or eternity, or anything elsethat the mind can grasp. God is beyond all words and ideas.The Wife Who Lost her RingOne popular story of the Middle Ages was about a rich merchant whose wife beganto spend a great deal of time in church. When her husband heard rumours that thechurch consisted of believers in the Free Spirit, he decided to follow her oneday. Wearing a disguise, he walked behind her into an underground cavern where –to his surprise – the service began with a dance, in which everyone chose his orher partner. After that, the congregation ate food and drank wine. The husbandbegan to understand why his wife preferred this to the local Catholic church;the service was better.When the priest stood up, he announced that all human beings are free, and thatprovided they lived in the spirit of the Lord, they could do what they liked.“We must become one with God.” Then he took a young girl and led her to thealtar. The two of them removed their clothes. Then the priest turned to thecongregation and told them to do the same. “This is the Virgin Mary and I amJesus. Now do as we do.” The girl lay down on the altar, and the priest lay ontop of her and, in full view of the congregation, commenced an act ofintercourse. Then the congregation each seized his dancing partner, and lay downon the floor.In the chaos that followed, the wife did not notice as her husband took hold ofher hand and pulled off her wedding ring; she was totally absorbed in herpartner. Realizing that no one was paying any attention to him, the husbandslipped away.When his wife returned home, he asked her angrily how she dared to give herselfto another man, even in the name of religion. She indignantly denied everything,demanding whether, as the wife of a wealthy merchant, he thought she wouldbehave like a prostitute. But when the husband asked her what had happened toher wedding ring, she went pale. Then, as he held it out to her, she realizedthat he had seen everything, and burst into tears.The wife was beaten until she bled, but she was more fortunate than the others,who were arrested by inquisitors and burnt at the stake.The story may or may not have happend, but such congregations actually existed.They came into existence soon after the year AD 1200, and soon spread acrossEurope. The Free Spirit movement declared that God is within us all, and thattherefore the Church is unnecessary – in fact, it is the Whore of Babylon. Thegreat poets are as ‘holy’ as the Bible. Sex must be an acceptable way ofworshipping God, since it brings such a sense of divine illumination – in hisbook The Black Death, Johanne Nohls gives this account of the Brethren:The bas reliefs . . . in French churches . . . represent erotic scenes. In theCathedral of Alby a fresco even depicts sodomites engaged in sexual intercourse.Homosexuality was also well known in parts of Germany, as is proved by thetrials of the Beghards and Beguins in the fourteenth century, particularly inthe confessions of the brethren Johannes and Albert of Brünn, which arepreserved in the Greifswald manuscript. From these it is evident that theBrethren of the Free Mind did not regard homosexuality as sinful. ‘And if onebrother desires to commit sodomy with a male, he should do so without let orhindrance and without any feeling of sin, as otherwise he would not be a Brotherof the Free Mind.’In a Munich manuscript, we read: “And when they go to confession and cometogether and he preaches to them, he takes the one who is the most beautifulamong them and does to her all according to his will, and they extinguish thelight and fall one upon the other, a man upon a man, and a woman upon a woman,just as it comes about. Everyone must see with his own eyes how his wife ordaughter is abused by others, for they assert that no one can commit sin belowhis girdle. That is their belief.”Other curious doctrines, “such as that incest is permissible, even whenpractised on the altar, that no one has the right to refuse consent, that Christrisen from the dead had intercourse with Magdalena, etc., all indicate thedeterioration and confusion of moral ideas caused by the great plagues,particularly that of 1348.”In short, according to the Brethren of the Free Spirit, every man is his ownmessiah.Sex with a StrangerThe Church did its best to stamp out these beliefs by sword and fire, but itstill took three centuries. And even when the Free Spirits had been wiped out,the ideas continued to exert influence. Around 1550, a man named Klaus Ludwig,who lived in Mulhausen in Germany, formed a church in which members wereinitiated by having sex with a stranger. Like so many messiahs, Ludwig said hewas Christ, the son of God, and that these things had been revealed to him. Thesacrament was another name for sex. Man was bread and woman was wine, and whenthey made love, this was Holy Communion. Children born out such communion wereholy. And the members of his congregation could not be killed. His sermons endedwith the words “Be fruitful and multiply”, and the congregation made haste toundress and do their best to obey.Ludwig taught that sexual desire is the prompting of the Holy Spirit, so that ifa man feels desire for any woman, he should regard it as a message from God. If,of course, the woman happened to be a member of Ludwig’s “Chriesterung” (orBloodfriends), then it was her duty to help him obey the will of the Lord, evenif she was another man’s wife.Ludwig told the Bloodfriends to observe great secrecy and to behave like otherpeople. But no doubt some of his congregation were eager to make converts ofhusbands with attractive wives. Like the congregation in the medieval story, theBloodfriends were found out and put on trial, although Ludwig himself escaped.One member of the Council of Twelve Judges admitted that he had celebrated HolyCommunion with sixteen different women. Three Bloodfriends were executed, andthe others were re-converted to a more conventional form of Christianity.Sabbatai ZeviOne of the most remarkable of all the “messiahs” was a Turkish Jew namedSabbatai Zevi (pronounced Shabtight Svy), who at one point seemed about tobecome one of the most powerful kings in Europe.Sabbatai was the son of a wealthy merchant of Smyrna (now Izmir) on the coast ofTurkey. Born in 1626, he was always of a deeply religious disposition; he spenthours in prayer, and at the age of sixteen, decided to observe a permanent fast,which lasted for six years. He permitted himself to be married to a girl whomhis parents chose, but the marriage was never consummated, and she divorced him.The same thing happened to a second wife. He was what would nowadays be called amanic depressive, experiencing periods of immense joy and elation, followed bydays of suicidal gloom.In 1648, when Sabbatai was twenty-two a great tragedy occurred across the sea inPoland. The fierce Cossacks of the Ukraine rose against the Polish landlords.The Russians and Poles had traditionally been enemies – in 1618 the Poles hadeven tried to put a Pole on the throne of Russia. The Russians and the Polesboth wanted the rich Ukraine. A Cossack leader called Bogdan Khmelnitsky invadedPoland and challenged the Polish army. He also set out to destroy the Jews.Poland’s Jews had been servants of the rich landlords whom the Cossacks hated,and they were massacred in vast numbers. All the usual atrocities of massacrewere committed – children hacked to pieces in their mothers’ arms, pregnantwomen sliced open, old men disembowelled, girls raped before their husbands. Onegirl who had been forcibly married to a Cossack chose a cunning method ofsuicide: she told him that she had magic powers, and could not be harmed by asword; if he didn’t believe her, he should try running his sword through her. Hedid as she asked, and killed her.A hundred thousand Jews died in this seventeenth-century holocaust. Thousands ofothers fled the country, and many went to Turkey, where there were alreadywealthy Jewish communities.When Sabbatai Zevi heard about these massacres he was appalled. Overwhelmed by adesperate desire to do something for his people, he suddenly became convinced hewas the Messiah who would lead them back to the Holy Land. And he began hismission by doing something that horrified his orthodox fellow Jews – he stood upin the synagogue and pronounced the name of Jehovah (or Jahweh), which Jewsregard as too sacred to speak. (Instead they called it Adonai.)Like all messiahs, he soon collected a small band of followers who believedevery word he said. His fellow orthodox Jews found this menacing, and banishedhim when he was twenty-five. In the Turkish town of Salonika (now Thessaloniki,and a part of Greece) he gained even more converts. But even his followers wereoften puzzled by his strange behaviour. On one occasion he went around carryinga basket of fish, explaining that it represented the Age of Pisces, when Jewswould be released from bondage. And on another occasion he shocked the rabbis byinviting them to a feast, then taking a Scroll of the Law in his arms as if itwere a woman, and carrying it to a marriage canopy that he had set up; thissymbolic marriage of the Messiah and the Law shocked the orthodox so much thathe was expelled from Salonika.At the age of thirty-six, surrounded by disciples (who supported him in style)he moved to Jerusalem. There he was seen by a young man who was to become hisJohn the Baptist or St Paul, the son of a Jewish scholar named Nathan Ashkenazi,who was deeply impressed when he saw Sabbatai in the street, but was too youngand shy to approach him. It was at this time that Sabbatai found himself abride, a Polish girl named Sarah, who had escaped the pogrom, become a courtesan(or high-class tart), and developed a strange conviction that she was destinedto be the bride of the Messiah. The story has it that Sabbatai heard about thebeautiful courtesan and sent twelve of his disciples to Leghorn, in Italy, tobring her to him. They were married in March 1664.In the following year, Sabbatai finally met Nathan, who was now twenty-two(Sabbatai was nearly forty), and allowed himself to be convinced that it wastime to announce to the whole world – and not merely to his disciples – that hewas the Messiah.The news spread throughout Palestine. But when Sabbatai rode seven times aroundthe city of Jerusalem, then went to present himself to the rabbis as their newmaster, he met with violent hostility, and another order of banishment. Sabbatainow decided to return to the city of his birth, Smyrna. Meanwhile, his St Paulwas writing letters to Jewish communities all over Europe announcing that theMessiah had come. These letters were read aloud in synagogues, and thousands ofJews were suddenly filled with hope that the Day of Judgement had at lastarrived. In Amsterdam, another Jewish centre, crowds danced in the streets. InLondon, Samuel Pepys recorded that Jews were placing ten to one bets thatSabbatai would soon be acknowledged as the King of the World.Not all Jews shared this enthusiasm; the orthodox were appalled, for thedoctrines preached by Sabbatai were horribly similar to those preached by theBrethren of the Free Spirit. “The forbidden” was now allowed, which includedincest and promiscuity. The Sabbataians (as they were called) shocked theirneighbours by walking around naked at a time when nakedness was regarded as asin. In the Jewish religion, as in Mohammedanism, women were kept strictlyapart. Sabbatai told them they were men’s equals and should mix freely withtheir fellow worshippers. Divorce or infidelity was no reason for a woman to beexcluded from full participation in religious rites. Was not the Messiah himselfmarried to a woman who admitted to having been a whore?Not that Sabbatai’s followers were inclined to sexual self-indulgence. They tookpride in mortifying the flesh, scourging and starving themselves, rolling nakedin the snow, even burying themselves in the earth so only their heads stuck out.It was a frenzy of religious ecstasy, all based on the belief that theMillennium was about to arrive.Now Sabbatai made the mistake that was to dismay all his followers and bring anabrupt end to his career. He decided to go to Constantinople, the Turkishcapital, a journey of fourteen days by sea. When the news reachedConstantinople, it caused the same wild scenes of rejoicing that had been seenin other European capitals. There was a general feeling that the Day ofJudgement was at hand, and that Sabbatai’s arrival would finally restore theJews to the glory they had enjoyed under King David.The Sultan, the young Mehmet IV, was understandably alarmed. Enemies of Sabbataiinformed his Grand Vizier, Ahmed Koprulu, that the Messiah was a charlatan whowanted the Sultan’s throne. If Sabbatai had heard about this, he might have feltcomplimented. The people of Constantinople were prepared to welcome him as thepeople of Jerusalem had welcomed Jesus Christ, and the secular authoritiesthought he wanted to become king. History was repeating itself. His reply, ofcourse, would be: “My kingdom is not of this world.”But the parallel with Jesus should also have warned him that he would soon beunder arrest. In fact, the boat had only just docked – after a painful journeyof thirty-six days – when Mehmet’s soldiers came on board and carried him off tojail.He was luckier than his messianic predecessor. Wealthy followers greased enoughpalms to make sure he was not put to death. Instead, he was installed in thecastle of Abydos, in Gallipoli, and allowed to continue to live in style, with asuccession of distinguished visitors. Unfortunately, one of these was a paranoidold man named Nehemiah ha-Kolen, a Polish scholar who wanted to argue withSabbatai about the Kabbalah, the Jewish mystical system. He was determined toprove Sabbatai an impostor, or at least, compel him to acknowledge himself,Nehemiah, as an equal. Sabbatai stood up for himself, and probably allowedNehemiah to see that he regarded him as a bilious and envious old neurotic.Nehemiah hastened away to denounce him to the Sultan as a revolutionary who hadadmitted that he hoped to usurp the throne. In September 1666, Sabbatai wasbrought before Sultan Mehmet, and ordered to convert to Islam or die on thespot. Faced with his supreme opportunity for martyrdom, Sabbatai behaved asunpredictably as ever. He promptly removed his Jewish skullcap and accepted aturban instead. He also accepted a new name: Azis Mehmet Effendi. His wifeconverted too, becoming known as Fatima Radini. The Sultan then granted him acomfortable sinecure as keeper of the palace gates, which carried a generouspension.Sabbatai, it seemed, had simply abandoned his conviction that he was sent tosave the world. He chose comfort – even though he secretly continued to practiseJudaism. In public he was a good Mohammedan. But his followers knew better: theyrealized that this was another of his inexplicable actions.Unfortunately, he was still subject to these extraordinary swings of mood, inone of which he divorced Sarah – although he took her back again as soon as hewas normal. And he also continued to preach sexual freedom. In due course, theseviews caused the Sultan embarrassment, and six years after his conversion,Sabbatai was arrested again. This time he was banished to a remote village inAlbania, Dulcigno, where he lived on for another four years. Sarah predeceasedhim in 1674, and he married again. He still had manic moods in which he declaredhe was the Messiah, but no one paid any attention.Oddly enough, his “John the Baptist”, Nathan Ashkenazi, continued to love andrevere him as the Messiah, as did thousands of followers, who regarded hisconversion as yet another of his strange god-like actions – rather like those ofthe Japanese Zen masters who suddenly kick a pupil downstairs. Sabbatai was theonly messiah known to history who was able to have it both ways: to proclaimhimself a charlatan, and still continue to retain the devotion of his followers.He was the last of the great Jewish messiahs.These are only a small cross-section of the messiahs who have appeared since thecrucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth.

But onenotable figure of the thirteenth century could also be regarded as the father ofmodern terrorism. His name was Hasan bin Sabbah, and he is responsible for themodern word “assassin”.The AssassinsIn the year 1273, the Venetian traveller Marco Polo passed through the valley ofAlamut, in Persia, and saw there the castle of the Old Man of the Mountain, thehead of the Persian branch of the sect of Ismailis, or Assassins. By that time,the sect was two hundred years old, and was on the point of being destroyed bythe Mongols, who had invaded the Middle East under the leadership of GenghisKhan.According to Marco Polo, the Old Man of the Mountain, whose name was Aloadin,had created a Garden of Paradise in a green valley behind the castle, and filledit with “pavilions and palaces the most elegant that can be imagined”, fountainsflowing with wine, milk and honey, beautiful houris who could sing and danceseductively. The purpose of this Garden was to give his followers a foretaste ofParadise, so that they might be eager to sacrifice their lives for their leader.When the Old Man wanted an enemy murdered, he would ask for volunteers. Thesemen would be drugged and carried into the secret garden – which, under normalcircumstances, was strictly forbidden to all males. They would awake to findthemselves apparently in Paradise, with wine, food and damsels at theirdisposal. After a few days of this, they were again drugged and taken back tothe Old Man’s fortress. “So when the Old Man would have any prince slain, hewould say to such a youth: ‘Go thou and slay so-and-so; and when thou returnest,my angels shall bear thee to Paradise . . .’”There is evidence that the story may have a foundation in fact. Behind theremains of the castle, which still exists in the valley of Alamut, there is agreen enclosed valley with a spring. But it is hardly large enough to havecontained “pavilions and palaces”.The Ismailis were a breakaway sect from the orthodox Moslems; they were theMohammedan equivalent of Protestants. After the death of the Prophet Mahomet in632, his disciple Abu Bakr was chosen to succeed him, thus becoming the firstCaliph of Islam. It is a pity that Mahomet, unlike Jesus, never made clear whichof his disciples – or relatives – was to be the rock upon which his church wasto be built. For other Moslems felt that the Prophet’s cousin Ali was a moresuitable candidate: the result was a dissension that split the Moslem world forcenturies. The Sunni – the orthodox Moslems – persecuted and slaughtered Ali’sfollowers, who were known as the Shi’a. In 680, they almost succeeded in wipingout their rivals, when seventy of them – including the Prophet’s daughter Fatima– were surprised and massacred. But the killers overlooked a sick boy – the sonof Fatima; so the rebel tradition lived on.All this murder and suffering produced powerful religious emotions among theShi’a. They set up their own Caliph – known as the Imam – and they lookedforward to the coming of a messiah (or Mahdi) who would lead them to finalvictory. Strange sects proliferated, led by holy men who came out of the desert.Some believed in reincarnation, others in total moral and sexual freedom. Onesect believed in murder as a religious duty, strangling their victims withcords; these may be regarded as the true predecessors of the Assassins.The Ismailis were a breakaway sect from the original breakaway sect. When thesixth Imam died, his eldest son Ismail was passed over for some reason, and hisyounger brother Musa appointed. The Ismailis were Moslems who declared thatIsmail was the true Imam: they were also known as Seveners, because theybelieved that Ismail was the seventh and last Imam. The rest of the Shi’a becameknown as the Twelvers, for they accepted Musa and his five successors as trueImams. (The line came to an end after the twelfth.) The Twelvers became therespectable branch of the heretics, differing from orthodox Sunni only on a fewpoints of doctrine. It was the Ismailis who became the true opposition, creatinga brilliant and powerful organization with its own philosophy, ritual andliterature. They were intellectuals and mystics and fanatics. With such driveand idealism they were bound to come to power eventually.[docimages/4.jpg]Two Assassins being instructed by the “Old Man of the Mountains”It was some time around the middle of the eleventh century that the greatest ofthe Ismaili leaders was born – Hasan bin Sabbah, a man who combined thereligious fervour of Saint Augustine with the political astuteness of Lenin. Hefounded the Order of Assassins, and became the first Old Man of the Mountain.By the time Hasan was born, the Ismailis had become one of the great politicalpowers. The Sunni Caliphs were decadent: the Ismailis set up their own Caliphand their own dynasty. They called themselves the Fatimids (descendants ofFatima, the Prophet’s murdered daughter). They conquered the Nile valley, thenspread slowly across Egypt, Syria, North Africa, parts of Arabia, even Sicily.By the end of the tenth century, it looked as if nothing could stop thembecoming rulers of all the Moslem lands. But at that point, a new force enteredMiddle Eastern politics – the Seljuk Turks – who swept across the Moslem worldlike the ancient Romans. And the Turks, as good Moslems, decided to lend theirsupport to the Sunni Caliphs. By the time Hasan bin Sabbah was a young man, theIsmaili empire was already past its peak.Hasan was born an orthodox Moslem – or at least, a Twelver, which was almost thesame thing. His family lived in Rayy, near modern Teheran. We know little abouthis early life except that he became an avid student of every branch oflearning. A strong religious impulse led him to look beyond the sect into whichhe had been born. He was impressed by the intellectual force and mysticalfervour of the heretical Ismailis. It took him a long time to decide to jointhem – for the Ismailis were generally regarded as outcasts and cranks. Aserious illness decided him; in 1072 he took the oath of allegiance to theFatimid Caliph. Four years later he was forced to leave Rayy – no doubt forspreading Ismaili doctrines – and started to make his way towards Cairo, a newcity that had been built by the Ismailis as their capital. The journey took twoyears. In Cairo, he impressed the Caliph, and became a supporter of his eldestson Nizar. He spent three years in the Fatimid court; then his ardentrevolutionary temperament got him into trouble – history does not go into detail– and he left Egypt and became a wandering missionary for the Ismaili cause.Legend has it that he was sentenced to death, but that just before hisexecution, one of the strongest towers in the city collapsed suddenly; this wasseen as an omen, so he was sent into exile instead. Another story tells how theship on which he sailed ran into a violent storm; while the other passengersflung themselves on their knees and prayed, Hasan stood perfectly calm,explaining that he could not die until he had fulfilled his destiny. When thestorm suddenly ceased, Hasan got the credit, and made several converts. “Thus,”says Von Hammer (a thoroughly hostile chronicler), “to increase his credit, didhe avail himself of accidents and natural occurrences, as if he possessed thecommand of both.” Von Hammer seems to regard Hasan as a kind of Rasputin figure,a trickster and a fraud who used religion to gain personal power (but then, healso describes the Ismaili religion as “mysteries of atheism and immorality”).Hasan bin Sabbah was a highly successful missionary, particularly among his ownpeople of Daylam, a wild, independent race who loathed the Turks. The Daylamishad been among the last to be converted to Islam, and even now they tended to berebellious and unorthodox. Hasan saw their value. Their country was an idealstronghold. And if Nizar failed to become the next Fatimid Caliph – which seemedhighly likely, in view of the intrigues at court – Hasan might well need astronghold.As the number of his converts increased, Hasan selected his fortress, the castleof Alamut (or Eagle’s Nest), perched high on a rock in the Elburz mountains,above a cultivated valley about thirty miles long.His method of acquiring the castle was typical of his methods. First he sent“dais” – preachers – to the villages around the castle, and they made manyconverts. Then the dais got into the castle, and converted some of its garrison.The castle’s owner, Alid – an orthodox Moslem – was not sure what to do aboutall this. He seems to have been an indecisive man. At first he professed to beconverted; then, one day, he persuaded the Ismailis to leave the castle, andslammed the gates. But he allowed himself to be persuaded to let them in again.At this point, Hasan was smuggled into the castle in disguise. One morning, Alidwoke up to discover that his castle was no longer his own. He was politely shownthe door and (according to one chronicler) given 3,000 gold dinars incompensation.This was in 1090. From that time on, until his death thirty-five years later,Hasan lived in his castle. He studied, wrote books, brought up a family andplanned conquests. Most of his followers never saw him. The religious rule inthe castle was strict; they ate sparingly, and wine was forbidden. Hasan had oneof his sons executed for drinking wine. (Another was executed on suspicion –false, as it later turned out – of having planned the murder of one of thedais.)[docimages/5.jpg]The Assassins’ Garden PalaceBut if the aims were religious, the method was military. The Ismailis wanted tosupplant the Sunni Caliphs of Baghdad. In order to do that, they first had todrive out the Turks who supported them. The Turks were the overlords of Persia.So Hasan’s task was to extend his realm, village by village and castle bycastle, until he could challenge the Turks directly. Where castles declined tobe converted to the Ismaili faith, they were infiltrated or stormed. In townsand villages, Ismaili converts rose up and took control. Like T. E. Lawrence –in his own battle to overthrow the Turks – Hasan’s great advantage was thehatred of the conquered people for their overlords. When he had extended hiscontrol to all the area surrounding Alamut, he sent a missionary to themountainous country called Quhistan in the south-east, where various hereticalsects were oppressed by the Turks. There was a popular rising, the Turks wereoverthrown, and Quhistan became the second great Ismaili stronghold. Not longafter, another area of mountain country in the south-west became an Ismailistronghold when another of Hasan’s followers seized two castles near Arrajan.The Turks now became aware of their danger, and decided it was time to crush theIsmailis; two great expeditions were sent out, one against Alamut, the otheragainst Quhistan. They soon discovered how well Hasan had chosen his fortresses.Although there were a mere seventy defenders, the castle of Alamut wasimpregnable to direct attack; and the surrounding villages made sure thedefenders were not starved into submission by smuggling food up to them bynight. A surprise attack sent the Turkish armies flying. The expedition againstQuhistan fared no better.And it was at this point, in 1092, a mere two years after moving to Alamut, thatHasan made the great decision that may well have been his crucial mistake. Herecognized that open war with the Turks was out of the question; his armies weretoo small. But his followers were fanatics who would give their lives for theircause. Why not use them to strike down his chief enemies, one by one? In 1092,the “assassins” claimed their first, and perhaps their most eminent victim,Nizam Al-Mulk, the Vizier of the Turkish Sultan.Until recent years, it was accepted that Nizam Al-Mulk had been a fellow studentof Hasan’s. The story told by Von Hammer – who repeats it from earlier Persianchroniclers – is that Hasan, Nizam Al-Mulk and the poet Omar Khayyam were fellowstudents, and Hasan suggested to the other two that if any of them shouldachieve eminence, he should share it with the other two. They all agreed. Aftersome years, Nizam became the Vizier of the Turkish Sultan Alp Arslan, one of thegreat military geniuses of the period. When Alp Arslan died (1073) and his youngson, Malik Shah, came to the throne, Nizam became the most powerful man in theland. At this point, his old school fellows presented themselves and remindedhim of their agreement. Omar, being a poet and mathematician (one of thegreatest of the Middle Ages), asked only for a quiet place to study; so Nizamgave him a pension and sent him back to his home town of Naishapur. Hasan wantedpower, so Nizam found him a position at court. What happened then is not quiteclear, except that Nizam realized that his old schoolfellow was supplanting himin the royal favour, and took steps to bring about his downfall. Hasan leftMalik’s court vowing vengeance; and that, says Von Hammer, is why Nizam becamethe first victim of the Assassins.By 1092, Nizam Al-Mulk was Hasan’s chief enemy, the greatest single danger tothe Assassins. Hasan asked for a volunteer to kill the Vizier. A man called BuTahir Arrani stepped forward. He disguised himself as a Suli – a holy man – andduring the feast of Ramadan, in October 1092, was allowed to approach the litterof Nizam as he was carried out of his audience tent. He drove a knife intoNizam’s breast, and was himself immediately killed by Nizam’s guards. When heheard that the assassination had been successful, Hasan remarked: “The killingof this devil is the beginning of bliss.” He meant it literally; his followersaccepted that to die like Bu Tahir Arrani was an immediate passport to Paradise.It may be that this murder showed Hasan where his real power lay. He couldcapture a fortress by preaching, cunning and bribery. He could destroy an enemyby sending out a single assassin. It looked like the ideal formula for guerrillawarfare.Where he made his mistake was in failing to grasp the ultimate consequences ofsuch a method: that if his men destroyed their enemies like scorpions or cobras,they would arouse the same loathing and detestation as scorpions or cobras. Andthat sooner or later, the horror they inspired would cancel all their gains. Itwas this that eventually frustrated Hasan’s plans for conquest.But that lay far in the future. For the moment, Hasan’s method was triumphantlysuccessful. Not long after Nizam’s death, the Sultan Malik also died – of astomach complaint, apparently. One of Nizam’s sons, Fakhri, was killed inNaishapur; he had been accosted by a beggar who said: “The true Moslems are nomore and there are none left to take the hand of the afflicted.” As Fahrireached for alms, he was stabbed to the heart. Nizam’s other son, Ahmed, laidsiege to the castle of Alamut; the inhabitants suffered severe hardships, butagain it proved impregnable. Ahmed was later stabbed by an assassin, but herecovered.The candidates for assassination were always carefully chosen. Hasan played hisgame like a master chess player. The death of Malik Shah brought on a strugglefor power at court; the new Sultan, Berkyaruq, had to defend his throne againsthis half-brothers. Hasan lent his support to Berkyaruq, and assassinated anumber of Berkyaruq’s enemies. Berkyaruq’s officers formed an uneasy liaisonwith the Assassins. So when Berkyaruq finally put down the rebellion, Hasan wasallowed to operate in peace for a few years.But he continued to practise the arts of infiltration and intimidation; Ismailisjoined Berkyaruq’s army, and made converts. When officers opposed them, theywere silenced with the threat of assassination. A point came where no one inauthority dared to go out without armour under his robes. Leaders of rivalreligious sects were murdered. One opponent was stabbed in the mosque as heknelt at prayers, even though a bodyguard was standing directly behind him.Eventually – in 1101 – Berkyaruq lost his temper and decided it was time todestroy the Ismailis. He combined with his half-brother Sanjar to attack thestronghold at Quhistan; the armies laid waste the countryside, destroying thecrops, and would have captured the main stronghold (Tabas) if the Ismailis hadnot bribed the enemy general to go away – a typically oriental touch. Sanjarmade other attempts to subjugate the Ismailis; but eventually came to toleratethem. The historian Juvanyi tells a story to explain this. Hasan managed tobribe one of Sanjar’s guards to stick a dagger into the ground near his head,when Sanjar lay in a drunken sleep. Shortly thereafter, Sanjar received amessage from Hasan that said: “That dagger could just as easily have been stuckin your heart.” Sanjar saw the wisdom of tolerating the Ismailis.Nevertheless, Hasan’s dreams began to collapse within a few years of hisgreatest triumphs. In 1094, the Fatimid Caliph – spiritual head of the Ismailis– died in Cairo. Nizar – Hasan’s patron – should have replaced him. Instead, theVizier, Al-Afdal, put Nizar’s younger brother on the throne. There was a war,and Nizar was killed. Hasan remained faithful to Nizar (in fact, his sect calledthemselves the Nizam); he refused to acknowledge the new Sultan. So he was nowisolated from his own co-religionists. After Berkyaruq turned against him, itwas all the Assassins could do to hold on to their territories. At eighty-seven,he was getting tired; he could not afford to defy the whole Arab world forever.But before the Caliph and the Old Man of the Mountain could make peace, the newVizier discovered a plot by the Assassins to murder the Caliph. In allprobability, there was never such a plot. Nizar and his children were dead;Hasan had no motive for wanting to kill the man who was now offering him peaceand cooperation. But the Vizier was a Twelver (not an Ismaili); he had goodreason for wanting to prevent the reconciliation. And Hasan’s reputation wassuch that any mud would stick. The Caliph took the “plot” so seriously that heordered that all the citizens of Cairo should be registered, and that allstrangers should be carefully watched. Many “agents of Hasan” were arrested andexecuted, including the tutor of the Caliph’s children.And so the last hope vanished. And in May 1144, Hasan bin Sabbah, one of themost remarkable religious leaders of all time, died in his castle of Alamut, atthe age of ninety. He appointed one of his generals to succeed him,demonstrating thereby that he had learned from Mahomet’s chief mistake.This was by no means the end of the Assassins. After initial difficulties, theSyrian branch took root, and it was the stories of the Syrian mission, carriedback to Europe by Crusaders, that introduced the word “assassin” into theEuropean languages. The event that caused this notoriety was the murder of theChristian Knight Conrad of Montferrat in 1192; Conrad was stabbed by twoAssassins – agents of the Syrian Old Man of the Mountain, Sinan – who weredisguised as monks. (King Richard the Lion Heart of England is supposed to havebeen behind the murder; one of his protéges quickly married the widow, andbecame “King of Jerusalem” in his place.) After this, Assassins began to figurein every chronicle of the Third Crusade, and the legend captured the imaginationof Europe. They were masters of disguise, adepts in treachery and murder. TheirOld Man was a magician who surveyed the world from his castle like some evilspider, watching for victims. They were without religion and without morality(one early chronicler says they ate pork – against the Moslem law – andpractised incest with their mothers and sisters). They were so fanaticallydevoted to their master that he often demonstrated their obedience to visitorsby making them leap out of high windows. Their arts of persuasion were so subtlethat no ruler could be sure of the loyalty of his own servants . . . A typicalstory illustrates this. Saladin – the Sultan of Egypt and the great enemy of theCrusaders – sent a threatening message to Sinan, the Syrian Old Man. TheAssassin chief sent back a messenger, whose mission was to deliver a message inprivate. Aware of the danger, Saladin had him thoroughly searched, thendismissed the assembly, all except for two guards. The messenger turned to theguards and asked: “If I were to order you, in the name of my Master, to kill theSultan, would you do it?” They nodded and drew their swords. Whereupon themessenger, having made his point, bowed and took his leave – taking the twoguards with him. Saladin decided to establish friendly relations with theAssassins.But by the time Marco Polo saw the castle of Alamut in 1273, the power of theAssassins was at an end. In Persia they had been slaughtered by the Mongols; inSyria, ruthlessly suppressed by Baybars, Sultan of Egypt. Some of the survivorsremained in the area of Alamut – where they may be found to this day. Othersscattered to distant countries, induding India . . .***In 1975 three of the islands in the Comoro group, which lies between Africa andMadagascar, declared their independence from France. Soon afterwards a man namedAh Soilih declared himself dictator of the tiny state with the military help ofa French mercenary, Bob Denard. Soilih proved to be a despot: he raised deathsquads, kidnapped and raped women and organized the destruction of all machineryon the islands.Two years into his reign, Soilih consulted a witch-doctor in order to know whatthe future held for himself and his descendants. The witch-doctor wasencouraging: Soilih could only be killed by a man who owned a dog. Upon hearingthis, Soilih acted as any dictator would and had his death squads kill all thedogs on the island.Nevertheless, a year later he was dead, “shot while trying to escape” by theforces of his old comrade Bob Denard. The French mercenary had received a newcontract, this time from one of Soilih’s many enemies. And the witch-doctor hadbeen right: among Denard’s troops was his ever-present mascot, a large Alsatiandog.Sunday Times***The ThugsBy AD 1300, the Assassins had ceased to exist in the Middle East, at least as apolitical force. In 1825, the English traveller I. B. Fraser remarked thatalthough the Ismailis no longer committed murder, they were still fanaticallydevoted to their chief. Fraser also commented that there were Ismailis in Indiatoo. This raises a fascinating question: whether the Assassins of the MiddleEast formed a liaison with their Indian counterparts, the Thugs. When WilliamSleeman was investigating the Thugs in the nineteenth century, he was puzzledwhy, although they were Moslems, they worshipped the Hindu goddess Kali. Onecaptured Thug explained that Kali was identical with Fatima, the murdereddaughter of the Prophet . . .The Thugs (pronounced “tug”) came to the attention of Europe after the Britishannexation of India in the late eighteenth century. At first, the conquerorsnoted simply that the roads of India seemed to be infested with bands of robberswho strangled their victims. In 1816, a doctor named Robert Sherwood, stationedin Madras, induced some of these robbers to talk to him about their religion.His article “On the Murderers Called Phansigars” appeared in Asiatic Researchesin 1820, and caused some excitement. Sherwood alleged that the phansigars orThugs (phansi means a noose; thug means cheat) committed murders as a religiousduty, and that their aim was the actual killing, rather than the robbery thataccompanied it.The bizarre story caught the imagination of the English, and the word “thug”soon passed into the language. The Thugs, according to Sherwood, lived quietlyin their native villages for most of the year, fulfilling their duties ascitizens and fathers in a manner that aroused no suspicion. But in the month ofpilgrimage (usually November-December) they took to the roads and slaughteredtravellers – always taking care to be at least a hundred miles from home.The method was always the same. The advance guard would locate a band oftravellers, then one or two of the Thugs would approach the group and ask ifthey might travel with it – for protection. A few days later, a few more Thugswould make the same request. This would continue until there were more Thugsthan travellers. The killing usually took place in the evening, when thetravellers were seated around the fire. At a given signal, three Thugs wouldtake their place behind each victim. One of them would pass the strangling cloth(or ruhmal) around the victim’s neck; another would grab his legs and lift themclear of the ground; the third would seize his hands or kneel on his back.Usually, it was all over within seconds. The bodies of the victims were thenhacked and mutilated to prevent recognition, and to make them decompose morequickly. The legs were cut off; if there was time, the whole body might bedismembered. Then it was buried. It was now time for the most important part ofthe ritual – the ceremony known as Tuponee. A tent was usually erected – toshield the Thugs from the sight of travellers. The kussee, the consecratedpickaxe (their equivalent of the Christian cross), was placed near the grave:the Thugs sat around in a group. The leader prayed to Kali for wealth andsuccess. A symbolic strangling was enacted, and then all who had taken an activepart in the murder ate the “communion sugar” (goor), while the chief pouredconsecrated water on the grave. One of the captured Thugs told Sleeman: “Let anyman once taste of that goor and he will be a Thug, though he know all the tradesand have all the wealth of the world.”William Sleeman was a captain in the British army; born in St Tudy, Cornwall, hehad served in India since 1809. He was fascinated by Sherwood’s paper, and inthe early 1820s, he began to study the Thugs in the Nerbudda valley. Therevelations he made in 1829 caused a sensation throughout India. Sleemanrevealed that Thuggee was not a local religious sect, but a nationwidephenomenon that claimed the lives of thousands of travellers every year. Sleemanbecame the acknowledged authority on the subject, and in 1830, Lord WilliamBentinck appointed him to suppress the Thugs.Fortunately for Sleeman, the organization had already become corrupt anddegenerate. In its earlier days, the members of the sect had been strict intheir observance of the rules. It was forbidden to kill women, because Kali wasa woman; it was also forbidden to kill religious mendicants, carpenters, metalworkers, blind men, pariahs, lepers, mutilated men, and men driving a goat orcow. Greed had caused a gradual relaxation of the rules (it must have beeninfuriating to let a rich caravan escape because it contained a carpenter orblind man); and it was to this disobedience that the Thugs attributed theirdecline in fortunes. In a sense, this was true. Haste and greed meant thatbodies were sometimes left unburied, so a search could be instituted morequickly. And in some cases, lack of preparation meant that the killing wasbungled – Sleeman mentions a case in which the Thugs were pursued back to theirown village, and saved from arrest only by the intervention of the villagers(who had been well bribed). When Sleeman’s researches were published, travellersbecame suspicious of “holy men” or poor Moslems who asked for protection. Betterroads (built by the British) meant that Thugs could be pursued more easily. Manyof them became informers (or “approvers”) to save their own lives. Within a fewyears, thousands of Thugs had been arrested and brought to trial.Sleeman was the first to understand the fundamentally religious nature ofThuggee: that the murders were sacrifices offered to the dark mother, Kali (alsoknown as Durgha and Bhowani). Because he was deeply religious, the Thug wasusually scrupulous, honest, kindly and trustworthy; Sleeman’s assistantdescribed one Thug chief as “the best man I have ever known”. Many Thugs wererich men who held responsible positions; part of their spoils went to localrajahs or officials, who had no obiection to Thugs provided they committed theirmurders elsewhere. Colonel James Sleeman, grandson of Sir William, describedFeringheea as “the Beau Nash of Thuggee”. Like the Assassins, most convictedThugs met their deaths with remarkable bravery, which impressed their Britishexecutioners. It is this Jekyll and Hyde character that makes the Thugs sobaffling. One old Thug was the nurse of a family of British children, andobviously regarded his charges with great tenderness; for precisely one month ofevery year he obtained leave to visit his “sick mother”; the family found itunbelievable when he was arrested as a Thug. For the Thugs were capable ofmurdering children as casually as adults. A Thug leader described how his gangdecoyed a group of twenty-seven – induding five women and two children – awayfrom a larger group of travellers (arguing that they could travel more cheaply).At midnight they stopped to rest in a grove – already chosen in advance as themurder place. There the Thugs strangled the adults; the children – twothree-year-old boys – were given to two Thugs; but one of them kept crying forhis mother, whom he had just seen murdered. The Thug picked him up by his feetand dashed out his brains against a rock. This was one of the few occasions whenretribution followed. The adults were buried, but the Thugs overlooked the boy’sbody. It was discovered the next morning by the local landowner, who set out tohunt the Thugs with armed men. After a chase, the Thugs were located; when thearmed men opened fire, they scattered, leaving behind much of their booty. FourThugs were arrested, and kept in captivity for a few years. (Sleeman points outthat the landowner’s motive was not a sense of justice, but to seize thespoils.) The other boy was brought up as a Thug.The male children of Thugs were automatically initiated into the sect. They werefirst placed in the care of a Thug tutor, who insisted upon absolute obedience,and acted as their religious instructor. (It must be emphasized that the killingwas only a part of the ritual of the Thugs, as Communion is of Christians.) Atthe age of nine or ten, the boys were allowed to act as scouts, and later towatch the killing. At eighteen they were allowed to take part in the killing andeat the goor.By the year 1850, Thuggee had virtually ceased to exist in India. Over 4,000Thugs had been brought to trial; some were hanged, others sentenced totransportation or life imprisonment. Sleeman came to know many of them – even toestablish a kind of friendship; for example, he was instrumental in getting thenotorious Feringheea a pardon (in the face of some opposition, for when the Thugleader was caught, he admitted that he had just returned from an expedition inwhich 105 men and women had died).The mystery of the origin of Thuggee is still unsolved. Feringheea told Sleemanthat all the Thug rituals were portrayed in the eighth-century carvings in thecaves of Ellora. (Ellora is a village in north-east Bombay province, and itsHindu, Buddhist and Jain temples extend for over a mile, with some of India’sgreatest sculptural treasures, whose dates range from the third to thethirteenth century.) If this is true, then the Thugs predated the Assassins bythree hundred years. In his book The Assassins, Bernard Lewis suggests that theThugs may have been connected with the stranglers of Iraq – the heretical sectthat sprang up after the death of the Prophet. But these stranglers flourishedin the first half of the eighth century, and four more centuries were to elapsebefore the Moslems made deep inroads into India. (The greatest of the earlyMoslem invaders of India, Mahmud of Ghazni – Khayyam’s “mighty Mahmud” –confined himself to the Punjab, in north-western India: Delhi fell to Mohammedof Ghur in 1192.) So it is altogether more likely that Ismailis, fleeing frompersecution after the fall of Alamut, discovered that India already possessedits own Order of Assassins, and formed an alliance with the Thugs. OtherIsmailis formed their own sects in India, and continued to regard the PersianImam as their head. In 1811, the French consul Rousseau observed that Ismailisflourished in India, and that they regarded their Imam almost as a god. In 1850,a sect of Ismailis known as the Khojas decided to settle a religious dispute bytheir old methods, and four dissenting brethren were assassinated in broaddaylight. The four killers were hanged. The quarrel centred around the questionof whether the Khojas of Bombay province still owed allegiance to the PersianImam. This Imam was known as the Aga Khan; and a few years later, he was forcedto flee to India – after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the Shah of Persia– and became the spiritual head of the Ismailis – not only in India, but also inPersia, Syria and central Asia. And so the homeland of the Thugs becameeventually the homeland of the descendants of the Assassins.To find a parallel to the fanaticism of the Assassins and the Thugs, we have toturn to some of the bizarre sects of Old Russia.***The Median prophet Zoroaster who founded the ancient fire-worshipping religionof Persia, ate only cheese for thirty years of his life.***The Khlysty and the SkoptzyIn the section on Rasputin (see here [05_chap1.html#lpn_21]), I havedeliberately said nothing about the strange religious cult to which he belonged,for it would have led to a long digression. In fact, when the young Rasputinvisited the monastery of Verkhoture with a novice called Mileti Saborevsky, helearned that it was also a kind of prison, a place of detention for certainmembers of heretical sects, the chief of which were the Khlysty, or Flagellants,and the Skoptzy, or Mutilators. During his four months in the monastery,Rasputin enjoyed speaking with these heretics, and he learned that the Khlystybelieved that the Kingdom of God can only be attained on this earth by theElect. They, of course, were the Elect.He also learned that one of the reasons the Khlysty were so disliked by theOrthodox Church was that their ceremonies were regarded as scandalous andimmoral. Since Rasputin was young and highly sexed, he probably felt that thiswas something that deserved looking into. At all events, he became a member ofthe Khlysty, and his enemies later declared that he had carried his beliefs backto his home in Pokrovskoe, and made them the excuse to seduce half the women inthe village. There is undoubtedly an element of truth in this accusation.But in order to understand the Khlysty, and their even stranger offshoot, theSkoptzy, we need to know a little about the great religious controversy thatsplit Russia into two warring camps at about the same time that Sabbatai Zeviwas causing so much ferment in the Middle East.The man who was to blame was, in many ways, very like Grigory Rasputin.Nikon Mordvinov was a peasant who turned to religion when his three childrendied. He made the acquaintance of the Tsar Alexis on a visit to Moscow in 1645,became a favourite, and was soon the most powerful man in Russia. He wasappointed Patriarch in 1652, and while the Tsar was away at the wars, Nikonacted as his regent and governed Russia.Nikon was a fanatic and a bully, and he decided to reform the Church by force.Things were slack in the Russian Church; the priest was usually regarded as ofsmall importance, and could be ordered about by the village commune. Nikontreated the priests sternly; he ordered them to demand respect and obedience,and when he thought they were not fulfilling their duties, he had them torturedand imprisoned. He also decided to revise the service and prayer book of theRussian Church. Some of these revisions sound absurd. He ordered a slight changein the spelling of “Jesus”, and decreed that believers should cross themselveswith three fingers instead of two. He also made many arbitrary changes in theprayer books – for example, changing “temple” to “church”, and vice versa.The violent resistance that he met was almost certainly not due to the changeshe proposed, but to dislike of being bullied. Those who resisted him calledthemselves Old Believers. After twelve years, Nikon overreached himself and lostthe Tsar’s favour; his chief enemy, Avvakum, was recalled from a Siberian exile,and took Nikon’s place as the Tsar’s favourite. But the Old Believers had notwon. The struggle went on with increased bitterness for the rest of the century.Huge numbers of Old Believers committed suicide – sometimes en masse by burningthemselves on huge pyres. (Mussorgsky’s opera Khovanshchina ends with such ascene.)Violent passions were aroused, but they were not necessarily religious passions.As in England at the same period, religion and politics were closely entangled.Still, there were many deaths, many mass executions, much cruelty, and thestruggle produced convictions where they had not previously existed. As aresult, Russia became a country in which religion was an important issue. Whilethe old-fashioned Greek orthodoxy had prevailed, Russia was a country with onlyone form of Christianity. The schism in Russia produced the same effect asLuther’s Reformation in Europe; new sects began to spring up overnight.Two of these – and perhaps the most interesting – are closely related: theKhlysty and the Skoptzy, the Flagellants and the Mutilants.It has been suggested that the Khlysty existed as long ago as 1363. This ispossible, but it is certain that the great schism gave the sect a new vitality.The Khlysty have a certain amount in common with the ancient sect of theManichees: they divide the world into spirit and flesh, and believe the spiritto be good, the flesh evil. But their most important characteristic is thebelief that Christ keeps returning to earth as a man. The resurrection isunderstood in this sense. Christ’s body remained in the tomb, but his spirittook another body, and has continued to do so throughout the ages. Averzhan wasone of these Christs, and was crucified on the battlefield of Kulikovo in 1380by Dmitri Donskoi. (Kulikovo is the Russian equivalent of the Battle ofHastings, when Dmitri defeated the Mongols.) Another Christ, Yemeljan, sufferedunder Ivan the Terrible, according to Karl Grass’s Russian Sects. But the mostimportant of the Christs was Daniel Philipov, who was a contemporary of Nikon.Philipov was a peasant from Kostroma who deserted the army and supported thecause of the Old Believers. The spirit of God descended on him one day when hestood on the hill of Golodina in the Volost of Starodub (in Vladimir), in theform of the god Zebaoth, who descended with a host of angels and enteredPhilipov’s body. The Khlysty call this “the second advent”. He began preachingin the village of Staraya, which in Khlysty mythology has the same kind ofimportance as Medina in Mohammedanism, and moved to Kostroma, which is theKhlysty Mecca. He produced a Bible called the Dove Book, and preached that menshould not marry, should not drink or swear, and should look out for martyrdom.If one of his converts was married, he should abandon his wife, and his childrenshould be called “sins”. He was allowed to take a new “spiritual wife”, a memberof the Khlysty, who might sleep with him in the same bed as his old wife – butthere should be no carnal relation.The most frequently repeated story about the Khlysty concerns their method ofworship. This was always held in the utmost secrecy: The celebrants were dressedin white, and danced around a fire or a tub of water, chanting their hymns.Yussupov’s account of their practices declares:They attained this heavenly communion by the most bestial practices, a monstrouscombination of the Christian religion with pagan rites and primitivesuperstitions. The faithful used to assemble by night in a hut or forestclearing, lit by hundreds of tapers. The purpose of these radenyi, orceremonies, was to create a religious ecstasy, an erotic frenzy. Afterinvocations and hymns, the faithful formed a ring and began to sway in rhythm,then to whirl round and round, spinning faster and faster. As a state ofdizziness was essential to the “divine flux”, the master of ceremonies floggedany dancer whose vigour abated. The radenyi ended in a horrible orgy, everyonerolling on the ground in ecstasy or in convulsions. They preached that he who ispossessed by the spirit belongs not to himself but to the spirit who controlshim and who is responsible for all his actions and for any sins he may commit.Finally the lights were blown out, and the worshippers coupled freely – theresults, according to one writer, frequently being incestuous.This is an interesting account, but it should not be taken too seriously. Nodoubt this kind of thing did occur, but it was not the rule. In his book RussianDissenters, Frederick Conybeare gives a less sensational description.The celebrants danced around the tub of water (which, he says, would begin toboil and give off a golden steam of its own accord) and flagellated one another,meanwhile chanting their hymns, many of them containing nonsense words that aresupposed to be the utterance of the Holy Spirit. Some of them would havehallucinations and declare that a raven or a mother and child were rising fromthe vapours of the tub. They would finally collapse with exhaustion, and lieasleep for hours. No doubt these rites often led to orgies in the dark. They arereminiscent of the modern snake-handling cults of southern America described byWilliam Sargant in Battle for the Mind:The descent of the Holy Ghost on these meetings, which were reserved for whites,was supposedly shown by the occurrence of wild excitement, bodily jerkings, andthe final exhaustion and collapse, in the more susceptible participants. Suchhysterical states were induced by means of rhythmic singing and hand-clapping,and the handling of genuinely poisonous snakes . . . brought several visitorsunexpectedly to the point of collapse and sudden conversion. But a young malevisitor . . . was attending these meetings with the deliberate object ofseducing girls who had just been “saved”. The fact is that . . . protectiveinhibition causes a breakdown and leaves the mind highly susceptible to newbehaviour patterns . . .No doubt a great deal of this kind of thing occurred with the Khlysty.The Skoptzy were a development of the Khlysty, and should be mentioned here tocomplete the picture of the background of religious dissent in Russia. TheKhlysty judged a man’s “Christhood” by his ability to suffer bodily pain. DanielPhilipov was, according to tradition, crucified twice. Philipov’s “spiritualson” and successor, Ivan Suslov, went one better, and was crucified three times(either at the order of Alexis or Peter the Great). He was also tortured byred-hot irons, and had his skin flayed off him. (On this occasion, a virginmanaged to get hold of his skin, and handed it over to him when he rose from histhird crucifixion.) Philipov died in 1700, ascending bodily to heaven. Suslov,who had carried his preaching to Moscow, and established his right to remainthere by refusing to stay dead, died about three years later.Seventy years later, an ancient lady called Akulina Ivanovna was known by theKhlysty as “the mother of God”. It was she who recognized the “Christhood” of aman called Ivanov, who became reverenced under the name of Kondrati Selivanov,and became the founder of the Skoptzy. Selivanov went further in asceticism thanthe Khlysty, and declared that men should be castrated, and that women shouldhave their breasts amputated and (if they could bear it) also have theirgenitals mutilated. In his early fifties, shortly after “the mother of God” hadrecognized him as her spiritual son, Selivanov emasculated himself with ared-hot iron. (Later he declared that he had done this at fourteen; even hisfollowers did not accept this estimate.) By this time, Catherine the Great wason the throne; she had murdered (or connived at the murder of) her husband,Peter the Third. This caused her some trouble, for Selivanov claimed to be Peterthe Third. Later, a Don cossack, Pugachev, assumed the title and led a rebellionthat was very nearly successful. Pugachev was finally caught and taken to Moscowin an iron cage, where he was executed with characteristic barbarity – his handsand feet were cut off and he was quartered alive. Again, in 1768, a Serbianadventurer successfully posed as Peter the Third and seized the principality ofMontenegro in what is now Yugoslavia.Selivanov’s assumption of the title seems to have led to no violentrepercussions; he was captured and placed in a mental home in the capital. WhenAlexander I came to the throne in 1801, he was released. By this time he hadmany disciples among the wealthy and influential, and he was allowed to conducthis “religion” openly. He wrote a book called The Passion which circulatedwidely, and he mutilated a hundred adults with his own hand. It was at this timethat he actually changed his name from Ivanov to Selivanov. He continued todeclare that he was Peter the Third, and his followers carried a coin with apicture of the sovereign on it (presumably it must have resembled Selivanov) andmany kept pictures of the prince as an icon, and said their prayers in front ofit. Selivanov lived until 1830, by which time he was well over a hundred yearsold. He had been interned in a monastery in Suzdal for the last ten years of hislife, but this did not diminish his influence; his followers made it a place ofpilgrimage. His followers – there were still many thousands of them at the timeof the October revolution – believe that he will reappear in the neighbourhoodof Irkutsk when the number of his followers reaches 144,000, and will inauguratethe Day of Judgement. The 144,000 will have to be virgins, male and female.Children born into the sect grow up with the knowledge that they will bemutilated when they reach puberty, any who try to escape are hunted down andassassinated, according to Conybeare. Mutilation is not obligatory among women,but is apparently expected. Sometimes the removal of a nipple is regarded assufficient.Sacheverell Sitwell has written of the Skoptzy in his Roumanian Journey, andtells of a typical case that took place in 1868 (when Selivanov was generallybelieved to be still alive, although he had been dead for thirty-eight years).This took place in Tambev, and concerned a rich merchant called Plotitsine fromMorshansk. Some of his servants were arrested for failure to pay taxes, and themerchant’s frantic efforts to get them released aroused suspicion of the police,who investigated his house. It was discovered to be a colony of about fortySkoptzy, many of them described as “beautiful young girls”. The men were flabby,with woman-like hips and high-pitched voices; the women who had suffered theoperation (not all of them) were almost indistinguishable from the men. All weretried and sent to Siberia.It might seem that the Skoptzy would at least escape the accusation of sexualorgies so often made against the Khlysty, but this is not so. It is reportedthat many of the women were mutilated only perfunctorily, and actually becameprostitutes who earned money for the communal treasury. Many men performed theoperation on themselves, and halted before they emasculated themselves. TheseSkoptzy were known as the Skoptzy of the Lesser Seal, to distinguish them fromthe fully mutilated members of the Greater Seal. It is therefore possible thatthe accusations of sexual orgies made against the Skoptzy may have a foundationin fact.The Khlysty and the Skoptzy would not be the only strange sects that Rasputinprobably encountered on his journeys through Russia. There was a sect ofTicklers, in which the men tickled the women to induce religious ecstasy;sometimes the tickling resulted in a state of exhaustion that ended in death,and those who died were regarded as lucky at having achieved salvation.In his book The Sacred Fire, B. Z. Goldberg mentions various suicide sects whichseem to be related to the Skoptzy. In the reign of Alexander the Second, a mannamed Shodkin founded such a sect, and led his followers into a cave, which theyproceeded to seal up. Two women became panic stricken and broke out. Shodkinthen called upon his followers to kill one another before the police arrived.The children were murdered first, then the women; when the police arrived, onlyShodkin and two of his acolytes were alive."},{"pageContent":" Chapter FourMore MassacresThe Black Death and the FlagellantsIn AD 1345, a horrible disease called the Black Death began to develop among thecorpses of earthquake and flood victims in China, and was carried by rats alongthe caravan trails to Europe. It reached the Crimea, in southern Russia, in1346. In a manner that seems sadly typical of human nature, the Tartars lookedaround for a scapegoat, and decided that the Christians must be to blame. Theychased the Genoese merchants to their fortified town of Caffa, then surroundedit and began to bombard it. But the plague had followed them, and the besiegerswere soon dying in an agony of thirst, with swellings in the groins and armpits,and the black spots on the skin which gave the disease its name.Before they left, the Tartars decided to give the Christians a taste of themisery they were suffering, and used giant catapults to lob plague-riddencorpses over the walls. The merchants carried them immediately to the sea, butthey were too late. The Black Death took a grip in the town, and soon themerchants decided to flee back to Europe. They took the Black Death with them.It quickly spread from Messina, the Sicilian port where the merchants landed, asfar as England, killing approximately half the population.Again there was a search for scapegoats. In Germany, it was rumoured that Jewshad been poisoning the wells, and fleeing Jews were seized at Chillon andtortured. Under torture, they confessed to the charge. They were executed, andthere were massacres of Jews in Provence, at Narbonne and Carcassone, then allover Germany: Strasbourg, Frankfurt, Mainz and the trading towns of the northbelonging to the Hanseatic League. Here Jews were walled in their houses andleft to starve; others were burnt alive.[docimages/6.jpg]Flagellants in medieval GermanyAnother scapegoat was the leper. In the Middle Ages, lepers were usuallyregarded with considerable tolerance and allowed to form grimly picturesqueprocessions; now they were stoned to death, or simply refused entry into thewalled towns.One of the stranger phenomena that flourished under the Black Death was themovement known as Flagellants. These had originated about a century earlier inItaly, when various plagues and famines convinced the Italians that God wantedthem to show repentance, and took the form of pilgrimages in which people walkednaked to the waist, beating themselves with whips or scourges tipped with metalstuds. On that occasion it had seemed to work and had been tried periodicallysince then. Now the Black Death convinced increasing numbers of people thatdesperate remedies were necessary. A letter, supposed to have fallen down fromheaven, declaring that only Flagellants would be saved, was first publishedaround 1260, but reappeared in 1343 in the Holy Land – it was supposed to havebeen delivered by an angel to the Church of St Peter in Jerusalem. Now waves offlagellation swept across Europe with all the hysteria of religious revivals.The Flagellants – mostly fairly respectable “pilgrims” of both sexes – wouldarrive in a town and hold their ceremony in the main square: they would strip tothe waist, then flog themselves into an increasing state of hysteria until bloodran down to their feet, staining the white linen which was the traditional dresson the lower half of the body. The pilgrimage would last for thirty-three days,and each Flagellant would have taken a vow to flog himself, or herself, threetimes a day for the whole of that time. A Master also moved among them,thrashing those who had failed in their vows.[docimages/7.jpg]A procession of FlagellantsAs Flagellants themselves carried the plague from city to city, public opinionsuddenly turned against them. The magistrates of Erfurt refused them entry, andno one objected. It was best not to wait until the Flagellants were within atown to raise objections, for their own frenzy made them violent, and they werelikely to attack the objectors – one Dominican friar in Tournai was stoned todeath. Human beings seem to be glad of an excuse to change their opinions, andonly a year after they had been generally regarded with respect and admiration,the Flagellants were suddenly attacked as outcasts and cranks. The Pope issued abull against them, and the hysteria vanished as abruptly as it had begun.One of the major effects of the Black Death was a shortage of manpower; hundredsof villages became deserted because there were no men left to work the land. Butthe wealthy landlords themselves were forced to sell land to the peasantsbecause it had become useless to them. And this meant a change in the balance ofpower. For centuries, the peasants had regarded themselves as little more thanslaves. Suddenly, the Middle Ages were at an end. Suddenly, the peasants couldpick and choose. In England in 1381, they rose up in revolt when King Richardthe Second tried to impose a Poll Tax, and the king only succeeded in savinghimself by promising them everything they wanted, then betraying them.But nothing could put back the clock. For more than a thousand years, all thepower in the world had been divided between the king and the Church. Now theordinary people wanted their share. A “mad priest of Kent” called John Ballpreached a doctrine that we would now call Communism – that all property shouldbe held in common, and that there should be no more serfs or lords. He wasexecuted immediately after the Peasants’ Revolt; but his ideas continued tospread. A reformer called John Wycliffe caused deep offence by declaring thatChrist is man’s only overlord, and that priests should not own property.Fortunately, he lived in England, and the Pope could not get at him, sinceEngland was at war with France, and regarded the Pope as no better than aFrenchman.A Bohemian preacher called John Huss was less lucky. In 1415, the Church luredhim to a “debate” with a promise of safe conduct, then seized him and burned himalive. It was a piece of treachery that would cost the Church very dear indeed.For now nothing could stop the spread of rebellion. And when a young German monknamed Martin Luther went to Rome in 1510 and was disgusted by the commercialismof the Church, the days of the Pope’s absolute authority were numbered.[docimages/8.jpg]Luther burning the Papal Bull, 1520***New York’s “Son of Sam” serial killer David Berkowitz claimed at his trial tohave been driven to kill by “demon voices” in his head. After he was foundguilty and sentenced, he held a press conference to say that his claims ofdemonic possession were untrue, being calculated to produce a lenientpunishment. Yet evidence that Berkowitz was part of a Satanic cult that orderedhim to kill, and indeed may have committed some of the killings attributed tohim, came to light after he was caught.In one of his anonymous letters to NYPD Berkowitz had mentioned: “John‘Wheaties’ rapist and suffocator of young girls”. An investigative journalistnamed Maury Terry found out that “Wheaties” had been the nickname of one ofBerkowitz’s associates, John Carr. After much work Terry traced Carr. He wasdead, shot in the mouth with a shotgun. The police reached the conclusion thatit was suicide despite the letters S.S.N.Y.C. being written in blood on the wallnext to the body. Terry discovered that Berkowitz and Carr had both gone toSatanic meetings in Yonkers, New York, an area where eighty-five skinned dogshad been found over the year before the killings started. Berkowitz also showedknowledge of ritualistic killings that had received very little news coverage.He wrote in a letter to a preacher in California: “. . .I was a member of anoccult group. Being sworn to secrecy or face death, I cannot reveal the name ofthis group . . . It was (and still is) blood oriented. These people will stop atnothing, including murder.”***The Great ProtestOn 31 October 1517 – All Saints Day – Martin Luther nailed a placard to the doorof the Castle church in Wittenberg, criticizing the Roman Catholic Church inninety-five paragraphs. He objected that Rome had become rich, self-indulgentand corrupt. When Pope Leo the Tenth heard about it, he remarked: “Luther isjust a drunken German – he will feel different when he is sober.”His casual dismissal proved to be a mistake. Within three years, Luther was themost famous man in Germany, and the revolution against the Church had started.If he had been an Italian or a Frenchman he would have been seized and burned.But the German princes resented collecting money for the Pope, and were glad ofan excuse to stop doing it. Monks and nuns left their monasteries and married.Priests began to recite the mass in German. Reformers began smashing sacredstatues in churches. And the poor and oppressed peasants began to revolt on amassive scale – the greatest scale so far in history. But at the height of hisnotoriety, Luther had to spend six months in hiding in the Wartburg castle –otherwise, he would certainly have gone to the stake like so many otherreformers.Muntzer the MessiahIn 1520, the year the Pope excommunicated Luther, one of Luther’s most ardentyoung followers was already preparing to go further than the master. His namewas Thomas Muntzer, and he had spent years studying the Fathers of the Churchand reading their works in Greek and Hebrew. Now, in the town of Zwickau, hecame under the influence of a strange messiah named Niklas Storch. Storch was aself-taught weaver who was convinced that the end of the world was at hand.First the Turks would conquer the world, then the Antichrist would rule over it;then God’s Elect would rise up and defeat the wicked in battle. When thathappened, the Last Judgement would begin.When he met Storch, Thomas Muntzer was already growing dissatisfied with theteachings of Luther. Luther taught that man does not need the Church to forgivehis sins; he only needs faith in God. Muntzer went a step further. Man canactually communicate with God and hear his voice. Once this happens, a manbecomes the vessel of the holy spirit, and he actually becomes God.Muntzer, who had been a bookish young man, now suddenly abandoned reading, andwent preaching among the poor, particularly the silver miners and the weavers ofZwickau. He said such unpleasant things about the Catholics in the area, andeven about Luther, that the Town Council dismissed him. His friend Storch led anuprising, which had to be suppressed by force. Many weavers were arrested.Muntzer went off to Prague – which, a century later, was still seething withanger about the execution of John Huss – and told his audiences that he wasfounding a new Church which would consist solely of the Elect. The Town Councillost no time in expelling him.He became a wandering preacher for the next two years, suffering great hardship– which only deepened his sense of mission. In 1523 he was invited to becomecurate in the small Thuringian town of Allstedt, where he performed the Latinservice in German, and became a celebrated preacher. Peasants came from milesaround to hear him. But so did Duke John of Saxony, who was worried about whathe heard of this revolutionary firebrand. At his request, Muntzer preached asermon stating his belief that the Millennium was at hand, and would be precededby great battles and appalling suffering. Duke John went away looking deeplythoughtful, and Muntzer congratulated himself on impressing him.Perhaps he did. But when some of his followers came to Allstedt, telling himthat they had been evicted from their homes by their landlords, he began tochange his opinion of Duke John, and preached a sermon declaring that tyrantswere about to be overthrown and the Millennium about to begin. Martin Lutherheard about Muntzer’s messianic ideas, and wrote an open letter to the Princesof Saxony warning them about Muntzer. Muntzer replied with a pamphlet accusingLuther of being (with some confusion of the sexes) the Whore of Babylon, and acorrupt slave of the ruling classes.This was hardly fair to Duke John and his elder brother Frederick the Wise, whowere amongst the most tolerant princes of the time. Luther had raised tremendouspolitical storms, most of which centred in their territories, and they weredoing their best to remain open-minded. So they sent for Muntzer and asked himwhat the devil he thought he was up to. The hearing at which he was asked todefend himself lasted several days. In all probability, he would have been sentback to Allstedt with a warning to behave himself. But Muntzer decided not towait for the result. He climbed over the Weimar city wall one night and made hisway to the city of Mulhausen, which was in the midst of a power struggle betweenthe poor – led by another revolutionary called Heinrich Pfeiffer – and therespectable burghers. The burghers soon ejected him. But a few months later,Pfeiffer took power from the Town Council and Muntzer hurried back.By the time he arrived, Germany had plunged into its own Peasants’ Revolt. Thepoor were on the march, inspired by Luther (who hastened to disown them), andthey skirmished with the troops of the local princes, and attacked monasteriesand nunneries.By May 1525, Muntzer was heading his own peasant army of about eight thousand,and was determined to lead them to the victory foretold in the scriptures. Therecan be no doubt that he was now convinced that he was a messiah – or at least, areincarnation of the prophet Daniel. His chosen symbols were the sword and therainbow.His luck took a turn for the worse when Frederick the Wise died, and wassucceeded by Duke John. The Duke finally decided that he had to take sides. Heappealed to the young commander Philip of Hesse, who had just put down a risingin his own territories, to come and do the same in Thuringia.Muntzer summoned his own forces and marched out to meet him. The two armiesfaced one another on 15 May 1525, Philip’s highly trained and well-equipped armylooking down on the unruly mob of peasants – armed with clubs and pickaxes –from a hilltop. Philip experienced a softening of the heart. He sent a messageoffering not to attack if the peasants would hand over Muntzer. The peasantslooked up at the army looming above them, and suddenly felt that this was notsuch a bad idea. But Muntzer once more revealed his skill as a leader; he made amagnificent speech in which he promised them victory and immunity from thecannons. “I will catch their cannonballs in my sleeves!”[docimages/9.jpg]Anabaptists taking the SacramentAs he spoke, a rainbow appeared in the sky. His followers needed no furtherconvincing, and marched to confront the enemy. As they came closer, Philip ofHesse ordered his cannons to open fire. As the balls cut a swathe through theirranks, the peasants turned and scattered in panic. Philip’s cavalry cut themdown as they fled. It was a total rout, and six thousand peasants were to die.Thomas Muntzer escaped to nearby Frankenhausen, but the triumphant army soonoverran the town. Soon afterwards, they took Mulhausen too. Muntzer was foundhiding in a cellar in Frankenhausen, and was taken captive and tortured. On 27May 1425, he and Heinrich Pfeiffer were beheaded. That was virtually the end ofGermany’s Peasants’ Revolt.The surviving peasants felt nothing but bitterness against Luther. But inretrospect it seems clear that Luther did the right thing. If he had supportedthe revolt, he would have been executed like Muntzer, and Protestantism wouldhave died. As it was, a law was passed declaring that each German state couldmake up its own mind whether it wanted to be Protestant or Catholic. Themajority opted for Lutheranism. Luther married a nun who had escaped from aconvent, had six children, and died at the age of sixty-three, nearly thirtyyears after he had started the revolution with his ninety-five theses.The Massacre of the AnabaptistsThe most horrifying episode of this bloody religious war was still to come – theslaughter of the Anabaptists of Munster, under their leader John of Leyden.Although the German princes had won the Peasants’ War, the spirit of ThomasMuntzer marched on. In these times of revolt and misery – a new outbreak of theBlack Death killed thousands more in 1529 – the poor continued to believe thatthe Day of Judgement must be at hand. The followers of Muntzer called themselvesAnabaptists (or rebaptizers – they believed that Christians have to berebaptized in adulthood), and after Muntzer’s death, his torch was taken up by avisionary called Melchior Hoffmann, who also taught that the end of the worldwas at hand. Unlike Muntzer, Hoffmann was a peaceable man who advised hisfollowers to wait quietly for the Millennium. But this did not save him. When heproclaimed that Strasbourg was the New Jerusalem in 1533, and that the LastTrumpet was about to sound, his followers held their breath, and so did theburghers of Strasbourg. But when the year passed without any sign of the end ofthe world, Hoffmann was seized by the Town Council of Strasbourg and hung up ina cage to die slowly.In Munster, the capital of Westphalia, a new Anabaptist prophet called BernardRothmann preached against Catholicism; his future father-in-law, a richbusinessman called Bernard Knipperdolling, gave him full support. The twofanatics ran through the streets calling on the populace to repent, and dozensof nuns who had deserted their nunneries joined in the hysteria, and beganwrithing on the ground and having visions. Munster was beginning to look like amadhouse, and as Anabaptists from a neighbouring duchy flooded in, thePrince-Bishop of Munster, Francis von Waldeck, began to feel deeply uneasy. Andwhen disciples of a prophet called Jan Matthyson arrived and announced thatMunster was the New Jerusalem, even the Protestants began to move out. One ofthe leading disciples was a tall, handsome, bearded man called Jan Bockelson,who, because he came from Leyden, was known as John of Leyden.Soon the messiah Jan Matthyson arrived, accompanied by his beautiful wife, anex-nun. He proved to be as tall and handsome as John of Leyden, and when hestood up in the market place, dressed in flowing robes and bearing two tabletsunder his arms, and told the populace that their city had been chosen by God tobe the New Jerusalem, they applauded wildly. Soon the whole town was awash withreligious ecstasy – the women playing a leading role. People had visions everyday, and – in the manner of the Brethren of the Free Spirit – felt that all thisdirect contact with God enabled them to a little sexual licence – after all,what was the point of being involved in a great religious upheaval if you had tostay chaste?In February 1534, the worst fears of the Catholics were realized when theAnabaptists were overwhelmingly elected to the Town Council and became, ineffect, the rulers of the city. Catholic churches and homes were sacked.Catholics who refused to be converted were driven naked out of the city. Theweather was freezing, and many died.Munster was surrounded by Bishop von Waldeck’s soldiers, but the Anabaptistswere not afraid. God was on their side. And at Easter, the prophet Matthyson hada vision that convinced him that he could raise the siege with a few followers.The next day he issued forth with twenty men – and was promptly cut down. Thesoldiers displayed his head on a pike where it could be seen from the citywalls.[docimages/10.jpg]A nineteenth-century depiction of a group of AnabaptistsNow John of Leyden was the leader. A bankrupt tailor to whom life had not beenkind, he had become the main hope of thousands of enthusiasts. The city ofMunster now became a religious commonwealth in the most literal sense – that is,John of Leyden preached the common ownership of property, and made the citizenstake their meals all together in great dining halls. He also had an idea thatmade him even more popular. Men and women were sexually free. A man could takeas many wives as he wanted, and a woman who wanted to become somebody’s wifemerely had to go and join his household. There was an understandable rush to getinto the prophet’s bed, and John of Leyden soon found himself trying to satisfysixteen women.Life in the New Jerusalem was delightful; the summer of 1534 turned into onelong party, in which the citizens ate their way though twelve hundred oxen andvast quantities of cheese and fish. There were endless processions and banquets.Traitors and unbelievers were executed to provide the populace withentertainment. Money was abolished, but medallions were struck showing John ofLeyden’s face surrounded by the legend “The Word Made Flesh”.Meanwhile, the Bishop was beginning to despair of ever taking the town; theenthusiastic soldiers of the prophet – 1,700 of them – repelled every attack.But as winter drew on, other princes sent reinforcements. Now the Anabaptistswere in real trouble, and discovered that it had been a mistake to eat theirfood in such quantity as they were driven to eat cats, dogs and rats. At Easter,exactly a year after the death of Jan Matthyson, the besieging general demandedthe surrender of the city. After months of starvation, hundreds had died and therest were living skeletons. Yet still John of Leyden’s faith and oratorysustained them. God was merely testing them; victory would soon be theirs. WhenBernard Knipperdolling’s mistress tried to escape from the city, he killed herwith his own hands.After more weeks of starvation, John of Leyden declared generously that any whowished to leave the city could do so. Parents with children felt this was theirlast chance, and about nine hundred marched out through the gates. But they wereworse off than ever, for the armies refused to let them pass, and they wereforced to starve to death outside the walls.In June, four of John’s followers decided they had had enough; the whole townstank of rotting flesh. They slipped out of Munster, and told the enemy generalhow some of his men could enter the city unobserved. On Midsummer’s Eve, 24 June1535, four hundred soldiers entered the city quietly after dark. When they werediscovered the next morning, fierce fighting broke out; it looked as if theintruders were about to be massacred. But the bishop’s forces chose this momentto make another attack on the walls, selecting the weak spots that the traitorshad pointed out. The fighting lasted all day, but the inhabitants were weak withhunger, and on 25 June, Munster fell. John of Leyden, Bernard Knipperdolling,and a leader named Krechting, were dragged before the Bishop and humiliated.Three hundred Anabaptists were promised a safe conduct if they surrendered, thenwere massacred. The two “queens” of John of Leyden and Knipperdolling werebeheaded. (Bernard Rothmann disappeared, perhaps killed in the fighting andmutilated beyond recognition.)The Bishop could not resist engaging John of Leyden in debate, but theex-messiah proved more than a match for him. When the Bishop said he receivedhis authority from the Pope, John replied that he had received his from God andHis prophets.For the next six months, the three Anabaptists were dragged in chains around theneighbouring towns and publicly exhibited. In January 1536, they were horriblyput to death in the main square of Munster. Chained to a stake, John of Leydenhad his flesh torn off with red hot pincers; incredibly, he did not cry out. Butthe pain was finally too much and he begged for mercy. The Bishop smiled grimlyand ordered that his tongue should be torn out. Then his heart was pierced witha red-hot dagger.Knipperdolling had tried to beat out his brains against a wall, then to stranglehimself, but the executioner was too strong for him. He and Krechting weretortured to death as slowly as John of Leyden, while the Bishop watched from awindow opposite. Then the torn and burnt bodies were hung in cages from thetower of St Lambert Church, where Bernard Rothmann had originally declared thecoming of the Millennium.The death of John of Leyden served much the same purpose as the death of SimonBar Kochba or Sabbatai Zevi; it punctured the pretensions of messiahs for a longtime to come. Some Anabaptists came to England, and because many of them livedin communes, they became known as Familists. Their founder was a MunsterAnabaptist named Henry Nicholas, known as H.N. (which also stood for homo novus– New Man), and his group had become known as the Family of Love. They declaredthat the essence of religion was simply love, and that no other law was needed.In 1575 they petitioned the British parliament for toleration, but five yearslater, Queen Elizabeth declared that they should be put down as a “damnablesect”.Eleven years later, a man called Hacket, who had proclaimed himself the SupremeLord of the World, was executed for treason, threatening God to rend his thronein two if He did not save him. God declined to intervene.In the reign of Charles I, a curious sect known as Ranters preached many of thesame doctrines as the Brethren of the Free Spirit: that sin was an illusion, andthat therefore adultery, drunkenness, swearing and even theft were not crimes atall. In 1650, Cromwell tried to suppress them with a Blasphemy Act, but was onlypartly successful. On the other hand, a remarkable prophet named George Fox, whowas wandering around England at the same time, and attacking organized religionas contemptuously as any messiah in history, succeeded in impressing OliverCromwell, and went on to become the founder of the Quakers, or Society ofFriends. (The word “quaker” was applied contemptuously, meaning that they quakedwith fear as they talked about the Wrath to Come.)His friend and disciple James Naylor was less lucky. Female disciples convincedhim that he was the Messiah, and he allowed them to persuade him to ride intoBristol as Christ had ridden into Jerusalem. Women shouted “Holy, holy, holy isthe Lord God of Israel”, and threw down their cloaks before his horse’s hoofs.He was promptly arrested. Tried in November 1656, he admitted to the judges thathe was the Son of God as well as a prophet, and his female disciples assured thejudges that this was so. He was sentenced to have his tongue burnt through, andto be branded on the forehead with a letter B for Blasphemer. After that, he waswhipped and imprisoned in a damp cell for three years.It ruined his health, and he died in 1660, soon after his release, when settingout on a preaching expedition. And so another promising messiah experienced thedownfall that seems inevitable for prophets who succumb to delusions ofgrandeur."},{"pageContent":" Chapter FiveMessiahs in the Land of OpportunityAfter the cruelty and bloodshed of the past two chapters, it is a relief toemerge into the calmer waters of the nineteenth century, when a messiah was nolonger in danger of being tortured or burnt at the stake. We are in a newatmosphere of tolerance – and of gullibility: an observation that is perfectlyillustrated by the amazing case of Saint Matthias.The Poisonous ProphetMathews discovered the power of belief early in life. In 1797, when he was anine-year-old, he decided that the fruit and sweets being shared around hisclass at school rightfully belonged to him. He told the other children that hisuncle, the “Man of the Thunder”, lived in a passing storm cloud and that hewould be angry if the sweets were not all given to his nephew. A moment later,thunder rumbled across the sky and Robert received an armful of goodies from hisfrightened classmates.What to most children might only have been an amusing confidence trick had adeeper impact on Robert Mathews. He developed an increasing conviction that hewas one of the “chosen”. As part of his training for his mission he decided tobecome a carter’s apprentice when he was sixteen on the grounds that it was a“divine trade”.After his apprenticeship he wandered the state, plying his trade and teachinghis interpretation of the gospel. His frenetic preaching style earned him thenickname “Jumpin’ Jesus” and he would often stand up in church and dispute withthe preacher. He married and settled down in Albany, New York State.After several years of relatively quiet home living, Mathews suddenly decidedthat he must take his children “out into the wilderness”, and set off for thedeep woods before his distraught wife could stop him. Fortunately, he and hishalf-starved children were found by a search party of concerned neighbours a fewdays later. Mathews was apparently relieved to have the children taken tosafety, but insisted on staying in the woods himself. It was here, a few dayslater, that he received the divine revelation that he was in fact thereincarnation of Saint Matthew and was thenceforth to preach the new message –as revealed to him personally by God – as the Prophet Matthias.At about this time a similar revelation occurred to Elijah Pierson, a rich andsuccessful New York businessman, although in a considerably less biblicalsetting. He was sitting on an omnibus travelling down Wall Street, when an angelappeared to him alone and proclaimed that he was the reincarnation of theProphet Elijah and henceforth he must be about the Lord’s work.Pierson immediately set about organizing a Holy Club, recruiting members frommany who had become disillusioned with orthodox Christianity. He also set up amission in the Bowery Hill red light district to bring the prostitutes to theLord because, he said, they were “the descendants of Mary Magdalen”.When his wife became seriously ill Pierson assured her and his flock that,should she pass on, she would be resurrected to help continue their work. Shedied as her husband sat praying over her fervently and anointing her with oils.When this failed to revive her, Pierson announced that he had seen a vision ofthe Prophet of the Lord whose coming would set all to rights. He instructed hisflock and even his household staff to be in readiness for the great event.Meanwhile, the Prophet Matthias was establishing himself. Having grown asuitably bushy beard and changed his preaching style from the frenetic to theportentous, he travelled to New York in search of a rich benefactor. Proclaiminghis message of vegetarianism, temperance and faith in the word of the Lord, hemade a convert of a wealthy businessman called Mills.Convinced that Matthias was a genuine prophet, Mills virtually begged him toaccept money. Saint Matthias was robed in finest purple silk with trappings tomatch. Mills was also ordered to commission a set of plates mounted with thelion of the tribe of Judah and two silver chalices for the Prophet’s exclusiveuse.Unfortunately for Saint Matthias, Mills’s family were less than enthusiasticabout the turn of events; they had Mills packed off to the Bloomingdale LunaticAsylum. When Matthias threatened them with Hell and Damnation they arranged tohave him committed to the Department of the Insane Poor at Bellevue Hospital.After an ignominious period behind bars he was released. But he had enjoyed hisperiod of affluence so much that he determined that this was how he intended tolive in the future. He now went to call on a friend of Mr Mills, one ElijahPierson.When he arrived at Pierson’s house the door was answered by the black cook,Isabella, who was a Holy Club convert. She asked him timorously, “Art thou theLord?”“I am,” he boomed without hesitation and strode in.Pierson spoke to the stranger for several hours, by the end of which time he wasconvinced Matthias was he who was foretold. The Prophet rewarded his faith byproclaiming that Pierson was not only the reincarnation of the Prophet Elijah,but also of John the Baptist. Matthias then settled into his new patron’s homeand proceeded to live like a king.The next convert was a well-off friend of Pierson’s, Benjamin Folger. Folger wasat first alarmed about the holy man and warned his friend of “the workings offalse prophets”, but Matthias’s combination of bombast and biblical quotationsoon won him over. As one of his first contributions to the new spiritualkingdom, Folger purchased Matthias a jewel-encrusted sword with which to “smitethe devil” and yet more purple robes, this time trimmed with silver and gold.In fact, the Prophet’s spiritual kingdom seemed to demand large amounts ofmaterial wealth. In September 1822, he was taken for a trip to Mr and MrsFolger’s summer home at Sing Sing. He liked it very much and informed them thathe had received a vision to the effect that Folger was to give the house to theservant of the Lord. His disciple faithfully complied, as did Elijah Piersonwhen the Prophet demanded the deeds to his luxurious house on Third Street, NewYork, together with its contents.It was not long before all of Pierson’s and Folger’s property had been placed atthe Prophet’s disposal, as well as tens of thousands of dollars. Thus fortifiedagainst the works of the devil, Saint Matthias decided that he and his flock ofelect should all move to Mount Zion – his name for Folger’s summer home in SingSing. The elect consisted of Pierson and his daughter Elizabeth, the Folgers andtheir children and Isabella, the devout black cook who had first recognized theProphet of the Lord.Unfortunately, there was little peace at Mount Zion. Comfort inspired SaintMatthias to behave like a tyrant. Lying at ease all day, served like a sultan,he would only assume the vertical position to berate his disciples. Any sign ofbacksliding or hint of dissent would unleash a torrent of abuse andrecrimination. Indeed, his Hell and Damnation sermons often lasted so long thatone started at breakfast would leave his followers no time to wash the dishesfor lunch.He also devised some unusual ceremonies – for example, he would bathe in a tubof water, then call his naked disciples to gather about him so that he couldsprinkle them with the water he had thus purified.At some point he decided that Mrs Folger was his soulmate and the “Mother of theKingdom”, explaining to her husband that she should be relinquished to him. AsFolger wavered, his wife suddenly announced that she had seen a vision thatconfirmed that she was the Prophet’s wife and a virgin in the sight of Heaven;under such divine pressure the unhappy Folger felt obliged to agree. As aconsolation prize, Matthias offered him his own daughter, then living with hermother and husband in Albany. Oddly enough the Prophet’s son-in-law agreed tothe arrangement – at least, after Folger had bribed him with a gold watch.Soon the goings-on began to deeply worry Elijah/St John Pierson. Being forced todo menial work was not how he saw the role of a double prophet, and he began toexperience the sin of doubt. After violent arguments with the Prophet he leftMount Zion, taking his daughter and the deeds to his house in WestchesterCounty. But his respite was only temporary. Within a week Saint Matthias and hisentourage had come to visit.In what seemed a peace gesture, Matthias went out to pick a big bowl ofblackberries, a favourite dessert of Pierson’s. Two others tried a few atdinner, but said they tasted bitter and left them. Pierson, however, ate a goodmany and became very sick. He vomited continuously, suffered epileptic fits andbecame partially paralysed. The Prophet stood over the suffering man anddeclared that he had encouraged fifty devils to enter himself by his sin ofdissent and those who tried to help him would suffer a similar fate. No doctorwas sent for.After two days Pierson seemed to recover enough to shuffle about the house, butthe Prophet threatened damnation to any who communicated with the sick man. Onthe fifth day of his illness, Pierson was found lying on his bedroom floor in acoma. The Prophet ordered that he be placed on a pallet of straw and poured coldwater over him to wake him from his “hellish sleep”. Not surprisingly, Piersonnever regained consciousness and died eight days after he had eaten theblackberries. The Prophet then acknowledged that he had indeed killed Pierson –by making a certain holy sign over him, a gesture that invariably led to thedeath of his enemies.Despite such alarming manifestations of his power, the kingdom of Saint Matthiaswas falling apart. His soulmate (the ex-Mrs Folger) seemed to lose faith in himwhen she gave birth to their child – prophesied to be a son who would be heir tothe kingdom – and it turned out to be a girl. Her ex-husband also seemed toexperience doubt when he discovered that the Prophet had bankrupted him. Bothasked Saint Matthias to leave their house. He complied reluctantly, but within aweek he was back, threatening that sickness would follow if they turned from thelight. They insisted and he left again. That same moming, the entire Folgerfamily became sick with violent stomach cramps and continuous vomiting.Fortunately, they all recovered.This time Matthias had gone too far. He was arrested and charged with murder,and in April 1835 his trial began. The Prophet, on entering the court, made hisusual dramatic impression by declaring that those who dared sit in judgement onhim were “Damned! Damned! DAMNED!” When the judge restored order he addedcontempt of court to the charge sheet.Twelve years later, the Prophet would almost certainly have been found guilty ofmurder and attempted murder; both Pierson and the Folgers had showed every signof arsenic poisoning. Indeed, Pierson’s exhumed body should have provided morethan enough evidence to send Matthias to the gallows. But the Marsh test forarsenic was not invented until 1847 and American doctors seemed unfamiliar withother European. tests. Eventually the case dismissed for lack of evidence. TheProphet served only four months in jail for his contempt of court, and forassaulting his daughter (he had beaten her with a leather belt for beingimpiously rude to Mrs Folger).After serving his sentence he went west, still proclaiming his sainthood, buthis reputation preceded him. Newspaper revelations about life at Mount Zion hadshocked and titillated readers throughout the United States, and his claims tonear-divinity no longer convinced. Fortunately, he was no longer in need ofmoney. He had taken eighty thousand dollars from Pierson alone, of which thedaughter Elizabeth was able to recoup only seven thousand dollars through legalaction.In his later years he met Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon Church of theLatter Day Saints, and they talked all night. Smith later described him as “abrilliant intellect but a mind full of darkness”.Smith himself was one of the rare – and unfortunate – prophets who arouse hisfellow countrymen to murderous rage; his story forms an interesting contrast tothat of the egregious Saint Matthew.The MormonsSmith, born in 1805, was the son of a Vermont farmer, and when he was ten, hisfather, Joseph senior, moved to Palmyra, New York, with his wife and ninechildren. It was a period of feverish religious activity in America, withvarious sects – Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist – expanding at an explosiverate as they made new converts. Joseph’s mother Lucy became a convert toPresbyterianism, which had been established by John Calvin in Geneva in 1536, asdid two of Joseph’s brothers and his sister Sophionia. Joseph attended meetingsof the various warring sects, and as he listened to them denouncing one another,he gave a great deal of thought to religion.In the spring of 1820, after reading a passage in the Epistle of James whichdeclared that those in perplexity should ask God, he went into a grove of treesto pray. There he had a revelation – a pillar of light descended, in which hesaw two men; one of these pointed to the other and said: “This is my belovedson. Hear him!” Smith then asked God which sect he ought to join, and was told:“None of them.” They were all wrong, and all creeds were an abomination in Hissight. When Joseph came to his senses he was Jying on his back. Back at home hetold his mother that he had just learned that Presbyterianism was not true.The revelation had no profound effect on him, and he later admitted that hecontinued to enjoy “jovial company” and to behave in a way that was not suitablefor one who had been “called of God”.Three and a half years later, on 21 September 1823, Joseph was saying hisprayers in bed when the light appeared again, and he saw a man dressed in awhite robe “whose feet did not touch the floor”. The visitor explained that hewas an angel called Moroni, who went on to talk at length about the scriptures,then told Joseph that he had written a history of the ancient inhabitants ofAmerica on plates of gold. After this, Moroni ascended to heaven in a shaft oflight. A few minutes later he reappeared, and repeated everything he had justsaid, then vanished as before. Soon he was back again, repeating it yet again.The next day, he reappeared as Joseph (in a state of understandable fatigue) wascrossing a field, and described where the plates were to be found.Obeying his instructions, Joseph went to a hill called Cumorah, about four milesaway. On the top, he found a large stone; which he levered up with a pole. Inthe hole underneath was a box, and in this he found some gold plates, abreastplate, and a pair of silver spectacles – which Moroni had called Urim andThummim – and which would enable him to translate the words on the gold plates.Smith was not allowed to take them yet. The angel showed him a vision of theheavens, and also of the Prince of Darkness and his legions, then explained thatJoseph must spend four years of preparation in order to become worthy oftranslating the plates.[docimages/11.jpg]A Mormon gathering in Salt Lake CityIn 1827, Smith was finally allowed to take the gold plates away with him. Hecarried them home in a borrowed buggy, but seems to have showed them to no one,not even his wife Emma, who went with him to collect them. Two months later,with fifty dollars presented by his first disciple, a farmer called MartinHarris, Smith and his wife went to Harmony, Pennsylvania, and there Josephsettled down to translating the plates with the aid of the silver spectacles. Hedid this behind a screen, so that no one actuallly saw the plates. Martin Harriscalled at some point, and took away a piece of paper with a transcription ofsome of the characters on it – they were apparently in a script called “reformedEgyptian” – and showed them to a New York professor named Anton, who gave him acertificate saying that the characters were genuine. But when he heard that theyhad been obtained from an angel Anton tore up his certificate.[docimages/12.jpg]The Book of MormonSo The Book of Mormon came into existence. It told how America had beenoriginally settled by people from the Tower of Babel in the fifth century AD.These settlers gradually degenerated into men of violence. Eleven hundred yearslater, more settlers arrived in Chile, including four brothers. From one of thebrothers, who was fair, descended a white race, the Nephites; from the otherthree, who were dark, descended the Indians (or Lamanites). After his death onthe cross, Jesus Christ appeared in America and preached the gospel. And in AD385, after the Nephites were almost wiped out by the Lamanites near the HillCumorah, their prophet Mormon wrote the history, which was then buried in thehill.Martin Harris mortgaged his farm to provide the cash for publication, and TheBook of Mormon appeared in 1830. Meanwhile, the gold plates had been returned tothe angel Moroni, no one but Smith having even glimpsed them, although a youngschoolteacher named Oliver Cowdery helped with the translation from the otherside of the screen. The first 116 pages of the manuscript had already been lostwhen Martin Harris’s indignant wife threw them on the fire.Reviews of the book were contemptuous; no one had any doubt that Smith was aconfidence trickster who had invented the whole story. But the critiques atleast aroused curiosity, and Smith soon began to accumulate followers. He alsobegan to accumulate enemies, and decided to move to some less hostile state. TheLatter Day Saints – as the Mormons now called themselves – decided to move west.The “missionaries” had already established a church in Kirtland, Ohio. ThereSmith received a revelation that declared that all members of the Church shoulddeed their property to the community, and a bishop would give each family backwhat he felt they required. As with John of Leyden, it was a kind of Communismin practice.Problems arose. The citizens of Kirtland objected to the Saints as the citizensof Munster had objected to the Anabaptists. In 1836, the Saints establishedtheir own bank and printed their own money; in 1837, it collapsed, causing muchhardship; five of Smith’s twelve “apostles” denounced him as a fallen prophet,and left. Smith saw it all as a test of the faithful.Other Saints had already established themselves in Missouri; Smith joined themthere. By now even Martin Harris and Oliver Cowdery had left in disillusionment.When angry mobs drove the Mormons out of Missouri – after Smith had spentseveral months in jail – they moved on ‘to found the town of Nauvoo in Illinois.But Illinois’s inhabitants proved to be as hostile as those of Missouri. Smithmay have made things worse in July 1843 by publishing a document declaring thatGod had ordained polygamy, or “plural marriage” – although at this stage it wasnot openly announced. (Smith himself must have been practising plural marriagelong before he announced its legality, for he seems to have married at leasttwenty-seven women, and possibly as many as forty-eight.) Finally, a disputewith the governor became so bitter that, early in 1844, Smith decided it wastime to go further west to found a City of the Saints.Governor Ford was worried as the surrounding communities armed themselves andtalked about massacring the Saints. In June, Smith and his associates –including his brother Hyrum – were charged with “riot”. Convinced that he wouldbe killed, he decided to flee, but then changed his mind and returned to givehimself up. This seemed to defuse the threatened violence, and Joseph Smith, hisbrother Hyrum, and two followers were lodged in Carthage jail.On 27 June 1844, at four in the afternoon, a hundred men rushed the jail.Governor Ford had marched his forces off to Nauvoo to restore order, and therewere only eight men in charge of the prisoners. Hyrum was shot by a bullet thatcame through the window, and collapsed on the floor. Joseph Smith opened thedoor and emptied his six-shooter into the mob. Then the attackers flung open thedoor and began shooting. One of the disciples, John Taylor, tried to jump out ofthe window, but was hit by a bullet. Joseph Smith attempted to leave the sameway, and was hit several times; he fell out of the window, twenty feet from theground. Staring out of the window after him, the other disciple, WillardRichards, saw that he seemed to be dead.A cry of “The Mormons are coming” caused the crowd to scatter, and Taylor andRichards managed to take refuge in a safer part of the jail. In fact, no Mormonswere coming. But since Joseph Smith and his brother were now dead, the crowddispersed.It was left to Smith’s chief lieutenant, Brigham Young, to lead the Saints ontheir great trek westward, to the place where, in 1847, they founded Salt LakeCity. With tremendous energy they irrigated the desert, and arranged thetransportation of thousands of converts from Europe. (The Mormons alwaysattached great importance to proselytizing.) When Young announced the doctrineof polygamy in 1852, he was deprived of the governorship of the territory.“Plural marriage” was finally disowned by the Church in 1890, but when Youngdied in 1877 he had seventeen wives and fifty-six children.Mormonism – as can be seen – always aroused fierce opposition. As early as 1834,E. D. Howe, an investigative journalist of the period, published a collection ofaffidavits from friends and neighbours of Smith who described him as a lazy andmendacious religious conman. Another investigator discovered a novel by theReverend Simon Spalding that was alleged to be the true source of The Book ofMormon. In the mid-1920s, Brigham H. Roberts, the official historian of theMormon Church, appealed to Church leaders to “help him resolve problems” aboutThe Book of Mormon, one of which was that it contained so many similarities to abook called A View of the Hebrews published in 1823 by the Reverend Ethan Smith.Another problem was that The Book of Mormon refers to the ancient Hebrews’ useof steel, and to domestic animals that were unknown in ancient times. Referringto many similar discrepancies, Roberts concluded: “The evidence, I sorrowfullysubmit, points to Joseph Smith as their creator.” Whether or not this is true,Smith remains one of the most charismatic and influential messiahs of thenineteenth century.***Dr Cyrus Teed, known to his followers as Koresh, believed that the earth washollow, and that life existed only upon the internal surface. He had been led tothis conclusion by a personal conviction that the universe could not beinfinite. If it was not, then, surely it must have form and boundaries? Theboundary, Teed concluded, was the earth beneath our feet. Everything above ourheads was contained within the earth, with the sun being the cosmic centre.Dr Teed travelled America during the 1870s, spreading his message andaccumulating devotees. In 1888 the Koreshan Unity was formed in Chicago, acommunity of “cellularists” who also believed in earthpower and the possibilityof immortality and resurrection. Like the Flat Earthers, the Koreshan communitycarried out scientific experiments on a straight section of canal, eventuallyconcluding that the earth’s apparent convexity was caused by optical illusion.Fired by a need to experiment further, “Koresh” moved his following to Estero inFlorida, where a flat coastline provided an ideal testing ground. There, acarefully made series of wooden frames were extended across the water, beginningat 128 inches above sea level and carrying on for 4¼18 miles. If the experimentwas carried out on the outside of a globe, the distance between the end of theline and the water should increase; Teed found that it decreased, proving to hissatisfaction that he was standing inside the earth.The Koreshan community, despite antagonizing Florida locals by block voting fortheir own candidates, thrived. In 1908, three days before Christmas, Dr Teeddied. The Koreshans were expecting him to rise on Christmas Day, but when he didnot, they were ordered by the authorities to get his body in the ground beforeit became unhygienic. A large tomb was built on Estero Island and Koreshdeposited within.A few years later the entire tomb was washed away, leaving no trace. TheKoreshans continue to live in Florida, having built a college to continue theirideas.***The Oneida CommunitySmith’s advocacy of plural marriage was undoubtedly one of the chief causes oflater hostility to the Mormons. Another prophet from Vermont whose views causedequal indignation nevertheless succeeded in avoiding martyrdom, and establishedone of the most successful and prosperous communities in the history ofreligious dissent.To his disciples, John Humphrey Noyes was an inspired prophet and a greatspiritual leader, but to most of his contemporaries he was a libertine whosedoctrines of free love and “complex marriage” were a danger to the community.There were many strange religious communities in America in the nineteenthcentury: the Shakers (so called because they went into convulsions of religiousecstasy that made them shake all over), the Ephrata, the Rappites, Zoarites andmany others. Most of these were “Perfectionists” – that is, they rejected thenotion that man is a miserable sinner as unnecessarily pessimistic and taughtthat, through Divine Grace, man can achieve perfection. The Shakers believedthat God is both male and female by nature, so women were as important as men intheir religious rites, many of which looked like orgies. But the Shakers taughtthe importance of strict chastity.[docimages/13.jpg]The Oneida CommunityThe 1830s and 1840s were a time of tremendous religious revivals in America, tosuch an extent that one portion of New York State was known as the Burnt OverRegion because the fires of revivalism had burned so fiercely there. Men likeHiram Sheldon, Erasmus Stone and Jarvis Rider preached their gospel in thecotton village of Manlius and their converts adopted the name of the Saints. Oneof the subjects that fascinated them was whether the old marriage vows wouldstill be binding when the New Heaven and New Earth arrived. (Most of the greatreligious revivals were based on the conviction that the Day of Judgement wasjust around the corner.) It was John Humphrey Noyes who provided a startling andcontroversial answer to that question.John Humphrey Noyes was born at Brattleboro, Vermont, the son of a Congressman;he studied law, then divinity He was a man of considerable magnetism andremarkable intellect and he seems to have spent the two years following hisconversion (at the age of twenty) in religious broodings and wrestlings. Hefound that he simply could not accept that he was a miserable sinner. Then, whenhe was twenty-two, the answer suddenly revealed itself to him in a blindingflash of revelation. Reading the Gospel of St John, he could see clearly thatJesus had announced the Second Coming within one generation of his own lifetime– that is, in the year AD 70. But if Jesus had already come to earth, then theKingdom of God was already here. In that case, why was there so much sin onearth? The answer must be because people were unaware of the Second Coming.This, Noyes could now see and explained why he himself could never feel that hewas a sinner. He wasn’t. He was already saved. All he had to do was to liveaccording to the gospels and nothing could go wrong.The Bible said that in heaven there would be no marriage or giving in marriage.The Shakers also accepted this and for them it meant an obligation to celibacy.Noyes did not agree. Sex is obviously necessary to continue the race. What theBible meant was obviously that all men were married to all women and vice versa.In The Battle Axe, the newspaper of the Perfectionists, he published in 1837 aletter in which he explained that “at the marriage supper of the Lamb . . .every dish is free to every guest”. Sexual intercourse is one of the best thingsof life – men and women were intended to “reflect upon each other the love ofGod”. Sexual shame was a consequence of the Fall, so all the Saved should nowabandon it. Men and women should have sex together just as they felt inclined,regarding it as a sacrament.At the age of twenty-three, Noyes returned to his home in Putney, Vermont, andpreached his views; he converted a number of his own family. He married thedaughter of the State Governor and one of his disciples, J. L. Skinner, marriedhis sister. In 1840, Noyes and a number of disciples founded the PutneyCommunity, which consisted of seven houses and a store on five hundred acres offertile land. They spent the afternoons in manual labour to support themselvesand the rest of the time in debate, prayer, reading, and teaching varioussubjects; including Latin, Greek and Hebrew.Meanwhile, Noyes continued to brood on the problems posed by his doctrines of“free love”. In 1846, he saw the answer. The problem with sexual intercourse wasthat it often produced unwanted results in the form of children. Mrs HarrietNoyes had produced five babies in six years and four had been stillborn. Theanswer was simple. Men and women should have full sexual intercourse, withorgasm taking place in the vagina only when they wished to produce children. Forthe rest of the time, the man must teach himself continence – not abstention. Hecould place his penis in the vagina but he must exercise severe self-disciplinenot to have an emission. It was a method that would later become known as thekarezza, a term invented by Dr Alice Bunker Stockham of Ohio. Noyes pointed outthat this method “vastly increases pleasure” (his italics). This doctrine wascomplemented by the notion of “complex marriage” – that every man should regardall women as his wives and vice versa.Noyes was not a man to keep his ideas secret – religious prophets seldom are –and he preached “male continence” (i.e. the karezza) and “complex marriage”quite openly. His neighbours were naturally outraged at what they took to be apublic rejection of all decency. (Even nowadays, a community with these ideaswould probably have a hard time of it if they lived in the vicinity of a smalltown.) There was public outrage and the following year, Noyes was indicted on acharge of adultery. He decided that his great vision was too important to bedestroyed by a few bigots. Fortunately, some of his disciples had already set upa community near Oneida Lake, about sixty miles away, with twenty-three acres ofland. In 1847, Noyes and his disciples moved there and set up the OneidaCommunity.What followed was a typical American success story – success preceded bydisappointment and hard work. There were only two log houses, a log hut and anold sawmill; the disciples were obliged to sleep in garrets and outhouses foranother twelve years. There were many hardships until an inventor called SewellNewhouse joined the community; he saved it from bankruptcy by inventing a steeltrap which the community proceeded to manufacture. They made travelling bags,satchels, preserved fruit and silk, and their workmanship made them widelyknown. They acquired more land and more people joined them. Two years after thecommunity was formed, another branch was started at Brooklyn, and then others atWallingford, Newark, Putney, Cambridge and Manlius. By 1878 there were overthree hundred members. They had built a large brick house in which they alllived. They had factories, offices, a school, a carpenter’s shop, barns andstables. The Mansion House – the main building – was centrally heated, withbaths and labour-saving kitchens. The community also employed over two hundredworkers from outside and treated them well.The aspect that has chiefly interested posterity was the sexual innovation. Anyman could propose love-making to any woman (or, indeed, vice versa) and she wasfree to reject him. Oddly enough, direct courtship was not allowed – a man whowanted to sleep with a woman had to approach her through the intermediary of athird person. What “male continence” (or coitus reservatus) meant in practicewas that the man put his penis into the woman’s vagina, then they lay still foranything up to an hour and a quarter. The woman was allowed to climax but theman was not expected to do so – even after withdrawal – Noyes denounced RobertDale Owen’s idea of coitus interruptus as “Male incontinence plus evasion”. Themale was supposed to stay in the woman until he lost his erection and this wasbelieved to obviate any frustration and nervous tension. Noyes claimed that hiscommunity had a far better record of less nervous illness than the outsidecommunity, while failing to recognize that there may have been otherexplanations for the situation.As a system of sexual and moral hygiene “complex marriage” seems to have beenhighly successful. Boys lost their virginity soon after puberty, girls somewhatlater. An older person of the opposite sex was generally chosen to initiate theyoung – one of the aspects of “complex marriage” that horrified the “outsideworld”, which felt a mixture of envy and moral indignation at the idea of amiddle-aged man or woman being allowed to deflower a fifteen-year-old. Onevisitor wrote: “The majority of the old women are hideous and loathsome inappearance and it seems to me the most horrible fate in the world to be linkedwith them.” But Noyes himself, as the father of the community (he was even knownas Father Noyes), naturally had a wider freedom of choice than most – after theage of fifty-eight he fathered eight children. It is not clear whether this wasaccidental or intentional. The community practised eugenics – which Noyes calledstirpiculture – and at one stage, twenty-four men and twenty women were selectedfor an experiment in selective breeding. But “accidents” also happened – onaverage one every eighteen months.Accounts of the community make clear that it was not a sexual free-for-all. Thewomen dressed modestly, looking rather like the Chinese in long white trouserscovered by a skirt. Any tendency by a couple to fall in love was regarded asselfish and “idolatrous”, and was discouraged by the system of “mutualcriticism”, which usually meant that the person to be criticized was summonedbefore a committee, who then detailed his or her faults. People often requestedmutual criticism just as someone today might go to a psychiatrist. One historianof the movement, Mark Holloway, in Heavens on Earth (1951) has recorded that itwas also used successfully to cure physical ailments, demonstrating that FatherNoyes also understood about psychosomatic illness. There was one case in which“mutual criticism” went further: when William Mills, a man in his early sixties– with an unattractive wife – tried to initiate more than his share of teenagevirgins with the aid of sweets and alcohol, and as a result was hurledunceremoniously into a snowdrift.Close attachments among children were also discouraged as selfish, which causeda certain amount of heartache. Otherwise, the children had an enviably pleasanttime. They were allowed to sleep as late as they liked in the morning and therewere dances, plays, pantomimes and other forms of entertainment for them. Norwere they deprived of parental affection. A mother weaned her child, then placedit in the Children’s House where, until the age of three, it spent the daylighthours. After that, children also spent the night there but parents could visitthem as often as they liked and take them for walks. They left the Children’sHouse at fourteen, when they were ready for sexual initiation and to join theadult community.The adults also had a pleasant time of it once the community waswell-established. Most members were supervisors rather than workers and theycould change their jobs to avoid monotony. Times of meetings, amusements andmeals were also changed for the same reason. There was fishing, hunting, boatingand swimming at Oneida Lake, twelve miles away, and they could visit othercommunities.The only real problem was the attitude of the outside world. The Americanconstitution allowed for religious freedom but flagrant sexual immorality wasquite another thing. One of the community’s chief enemies was Professor John W.Mears, of Hamilton College, who denounced it as “a Utopia of obscenity”. ThePresbyterian Synod of Central New York appointed a committee of seven toinvestigate the activities of the community, but was unsuccessful in destroyingit. Eventually, the community began to decay from within. Many younger membersthought that Noyes’s religious doctrines were absurd; some were even agnostics(Noyes allowed members to study Huxley and Darwin). Noyes wanted to retire andappointed his agnostic son, Dr Theodore Noyes, to take his place but this causeddissension. Some members of the community even sided with the puritanical DrMears. Noyes finally slipped quietly away from Oneida and moved to Niagara Fallsin 1876 at the age of sixty-five. It became clear that if Oneida wanted tosurvive, it would have to stop outraging the outside world with its sexualfreedom. “Complex marriage” was abandoned; the alternatives offered werecelibacy or marriage and most preferred marriage. But to try to suppress“complex marriage” was tantamount to removing one of the main foundations of thecommunity. “The Community sank step by step into its own Dark Ages,” says onehistorian. The old generosity of spirit vanished, so that “it was almostimpossible to borrow a hammer from one’s next door neighbour”. In 1881, theOneida Community was reorganized as a joint stock company, and “Communism” wasabandoned. Children were still educated free until they were sixteen, then theywere given $200 to give them a “start in life”. “An arid commercialism” replacedthe old communal spirit and the community began to split up. Yet the originalOneida branch remained commercially successful.Noyes died in 1886 still believing firmly that the community had been ordainedby God; praise and violent criticism continued long after his death. One Englishvisitor had described him as “a tall, pale man, with sandy hair and beard, grey,dreamy eyes, good mouth, white temples and a noble forehead”. But the secularistCharles Bradlaugh was to describe him as “singularly unloveable, with hisprotruding, stuckout lower lip, his tired satyr like leer . . . an eccentricgoatish half-inch stripe of beard running from ear to ear”. Yet fifty-threeyoung women had once signed a resolution declaring that they belonged to him as“God’s true representative”, and that they were perfectly happy for him todecide which of the male members of the community were to father their children.It cannot be denied that Noyes was one of the most remarkable visionaries tocome out of America in the nineteenth century.Bernard Shaw commented about Noyes that he was “one of those chance attempts atthe Superman which occur from time to time in spite of the interference of man’sblundering institutions”. If this study has taught us anything, it is thatmessiahs come in all shapes and sizes and psychological types, from thegenuinely inspired to the self-deluded, from saints to conmen. And in just a fewcases, it is virtually impossible to decide which category a messiah belongs to.Henry James PrinceThis is the dilemma that confronts us in considering the case of the ReverendHenry James Prince, one of the most remarkable preachers of the “Spirit of Love”in the nineteenth century. After graduating from theological college in 1837 –when he was twenty-six – he became curate of Charlinch, near Bridgewater,Somerset, and was soon drawing enormous crowds with his fiery sermons. He waspermanently surrounded by adoring female disciples, and when ugly rumoursreached his bishop, he was forbidden to continue preaching. He left the Churchof England and began preaching in barns and open fields. One day he announced hewas the Prophet Elijah, and his followers accepted the revelation withoutquestion.Prince moved to Brighton – then a fashionable resort – and became the mostpopular preacher of his day. With £30,000 collected from disciples, he bought anestate at Spaxton, near Bridgewater, and turned it into Agapomene, or the Abodeof Love. Disciples who wished to join him had to sell all they had andcontribute it to the community. About sixty followers, mostly women, acceptedthe invitation.Unlike his American contemporary, John Humphrey Noyes, Prince did not actuallypreach Free Love; but he certainly practised it, regarding his female disciplesas Brides of the Lord. He himself did not mind being addressed as God, andletters addressed to Our Lord God, Somerset, reached him without difficulty. Oneday he summoned all his disciples to the billiard room to watch a public act ofworship – his intimate union with a Miss Patterson – on the settee.When she became pregnant, Prince told his followers that there would be no birth– just as there was now no death – but when a baby arrived, he had to explain itaway as a final despairing act of the Devil. Then lawsuits began to cloud hishorizon. In 1860, three female followers sued for the return of nearly £6,000,and the revelation of the goings-on in the Abode of Love startled and shockedVictorian England. After the case, Prince’s actions became more discreet; but hecontinued to live happily, surrounded by his private harem, until his death,aged eighty-eight, in 1899.Two years before his death, Prince had acquired an influential disciple: HughSmyth-Pigott, another spellbinding preacher. Smyth-Pigott took over theAgapomenite Church at Clapton, a suburb of London, and his sermons were soonproducing the same effect as Prince’s had done half a century before. On Sunday,7 September 1902, Smyth-Pigott announced from the pulpit that he had becomedivine, and that he would shortly walk on water. The next Sunday, 6,000 peoplewaited for his arrival, cheering and booing. Showers of stones followed him backhome.Smyth-Pigott decided to move to the Abode of Love, and in 1904 he took upresidence, together with his wife and a mistress, who soon bore him a child.When, in 1909, a Bishop’s Court found him guilty of “immorality, uncleanness andwickedness of life”, he commented: “It doesn’t matter what they do. I am God”and in the following year a daughter was born to him by another disciple.He went preaching and gathering more disciples in America and Scandinavia; whenhe found particularly attractive girls, they were dubbed “soul brides” and sentback to Spaxton to await his arrival. Smyth-Pigott died in 1927, disappointingthe expectations of his followers, who were convinced he was immortal. Onewoman, who had been brought up at the Abode of Love revealed that when theReverend Prince had died he had handed Smyth-Pigott a “Horn of Power” andauthority to carry on his mission. The exact nature of this horn of power is notknown, but the symbolism seems apt.***The Church of the Subgenius, a Texan cult and money-making organization,worships Bob “JR” Dobbs. “Bob” is a Fifties father icon, pipe firmly heldbetween perfect teeth and hair brilliantined back. The only requirement ofadherents, apart from a large donation, is that they immediately reject theviews of all other “Subgenii”, becoming heretics, and form their own sect.***"},{"pageContent":" Chapter SixManic Messiahs and Twentieth-Century CultsThe twentieth century has witnessed an unusually rich crop of messiahs, althoughit must be admitted that most of them have been conmen. A few of these havearoused such indignation among their disillusioned disciples that they have meta violent end.Franz Creffield, or Joshua the SecondThe man with the enormous tangled beard raised his arm above his head and criedin a deep voice: “Bring a curse, O God, on San Francisco, on Portland, onCorvallis and on Seattle.” With which, he turned and clambered on board thetrain from Seattle. It was the morning of 17 April 1906. The next day, when hearrived at his destination – Newport, Oregon – his followers met him with theincredible news: San Francisco had just been torn apart by an earthquake, andwas now burning to the ground. “Yes, I knew that God would respond,” said theprophet quietly.The man’s name was Franz Edmund Creffield. He spoke with a German accent, and inthe year 1906 he was thirty-one years old. He enters the history of falseprophets and cranky messiahs in 1903, shortly after he had been thrown out of aSalvation Army group in Corvallis, Oregon. According to the historian ArnoldToynbee, all major prophets follow a cycle of “withdrawal and return”,retreating from society to the solitude of forest or desert, and returning withthe Great Message finally crystallized. Franz Creffield was no exception; earlyin 1903 he vanished into the forests of Oregon. When he emerged, a few monthslater, he had grown a beard like a briar patch full of birds’ nests, and hishair fell over his shoulders. He had also acquired a new name: Joshua theSecond.Like another prophet who was making a reputation at that time – GrigoryEfimovich Rasputin, the “Russian monk”– Franz Creffield held a remarkablefascination for women. There the resemblance seems to end. Rasputin undoubtedlyhad genuine powers of thaumaturgy, or “spirit healing”, and his diaries revealthat his mystical faith was deep and genuine. Creffield, on the other hand, wasa born deceiver. The best that can be said for him is that he was self-deceived.He preached his mission in Corvallis, and acquired a few dozen followers, maleand female. For some reason, the males dropped out; it was their wives anddaughters who remained. Joshua’s religious faith became more fervent andcompelling. Surrounded by adoring women, he would call upon the “full spirit” todescend on them. They would all sway and chant, clapping rhythmically, and asthe excitement became hysterical, Joshua would cry: “Begone vile clothes,” andstart to fling his robes around the room. The women would do the same, some ofthem modestly stripping down to their shifts, others flinging off every stitch.Then they would all roll on the floor, moaning and crying out.Inevitably, the men of Corvallis began to feel uneasy, and some of the morerespectable wives left. Joshua had announced that he was seeking for a woman whowould become the Second Mother of Christ: he, of course, was to be the father.He searched conscientiously; many candidates were rigorously tested, and if theHoly Spirit finally indicated that none was suitable, they at least had thesatisfaction of knowing they had been engaged in the Lord’s work.This quest for the Second Mother took place on Kiger Island, in the middle of ariver, and throughout the summer the prophet and his followers held prayermeetings by night and danced naked in the woods by day. When the winter came,Joshua moved back into Corvallis, into the home of a man named O. P. Hunt, whosedaughter Maude was one of the prophet’s warmest admirers. A notice over the doorsaid: “No Admittance Except on God’s Business.”The prayer meetings finally aroused so much hostility that Joshua was summonedto the courthouse; together with his chief male disciple, Brother Brooks, for asanity hearing. He was found sane, but advised to leave town. He ignored thesuggestion, and went back to the Hunts’ house. Then someone began to circulatephotographs that had been taken on Kiger Island. They showed naked women – mostof them recognizable as Corvallis housewives – romping in the bushes.On 4 January 1904, a deputation of male citizens called on the prophet, escortedhim to the edge of town, tarred and feathered him, and turned him loose. He wasfound by Mrs Hunt and her daughter Maude and brought back home; shortlyafterwards, he married Maude. But he soon felt the old compulsion to continuewith the Lord’s work. He went to Portland to visit one of his chief femaledisciples. One day, the lady’s husband found the prophet performing the Lord’swork without his trousers on. He took out a warrant for adultery. Joshua’s angryfather-in-law offered $150 for his capture, but Joshua could not be found.Three months later, a child ran under the Hunt house – which was built clear ofthe ground – looking for a lost ball. He saw a bearded man dressed in a blanket,and ran out yelling. The police were called, and Joshua was dragged out. Itseemed that he had been living under the house since he fled from Portland,supplied with food by his wife and her mother. In court, he admitted adulterywith the Portland disciple, but explained that he could not be judged by secularlaw; after all, Jesus had often broken the Sabbath. He was sentenced to twoyears in jail, but was released after fifteen months.His ex-wife Maude, now divorced, was living in Seattle with a brother, Frank,and sister-in-law. Joshua wrote to her, asking her to remarry him. She agreed,and they were joined again in Seattle. The brother and sister-in-law were deeplyimpressed by the prophet – so much so that when Joshua ordered them to selltheir home and worldly goods, and move with him to a “Garden of Eden” nearNewport, Oregon, they did so without hesitation. It was as he left Seattle thatJoshua pronounced the curse that “caused” the San Francisco earthquake.Once established in his Eden, facing the Pacific Ocean just south of Waldport,the prophet sent word to former disciples in Corvallis, including a pretty girlnamed Esther Mitchell. Without hesitation, half the female population ofCorvallis left home and streamed towards Eden. One husband rushed after hiswife, pausing only to buy a revolver and cartridges.As he reached the ferryboat across Yaquina Bay, he saw the prophet standing ondeck surrounded by disciples; he pointed the revolver, and pulled the triggerfive times. Nothing happened. When the outraged husband examined the pistol, hediscovered the shop had sold him rimfire cartridges for a centre-fire gun, butthe female disciples were not surprised; they knew Joshua was immortal.All the same, the prophet could see that he was courting danger if he remainedin Eden during the next week or so. The sensible course would be to allow thehusbands to simmer down. As they converged on Eden, Joshua and Maudedisappeared. George Mitchell, brother of the prophet’s favourite discipleEsther, reasoned that they would probably be making for Seattle again. Hetracked them there on 7 May 1906. At eight o’clock that morning, Joshua waslooking in the window of Quick’s Drug Store in First Avenue, while Maude wasweighing herself on a machine. George Mitchell stepped up to the prophet, placeda gun against his ear, and pulled the trigger. Joshua collapsed without eventurning his head. Maude flew at Mitchell, screaming. When a policeman camerunning up, she told him: “That is my husband Joshua. He will rise in threedays.”But Joshua stayed dead, and Mitchell was tried for his murder. The defenceargued that Joshua was “a degenerate of the worst sort”. The jury agreed,particularly when Mitchell stated in court that Joshua had taken the virginityof both his sisters. George Mitchell was acquitted. His sister Esther listenedimpassively.On 12 July 1906, George Mitchell stood at King Street station, waiting to takethe train home. His brother Fred saw Esther standing nearby, and asked her tocome and speak to George. Esther walked over to the rest of the group, and asthey moved towards the ticket barrier drew a small revolver from under thefolded coat on her arm. She placed it against George’s ear and pulled thetrigger. Like Joshua, he collapsed without a word.Esther Mitchell and Maude Creffield were both held – they admitted planningGeorge’s murder together. Maude took strychnine in prison; Esther was tried, butfound not guilty by reason of insanity, and was committed to the WashingtonState Asylum. Three years later she was released, looking very thin and ill, anddied at the home of friends shortly afterwards. She was just twenty.One problem, of course, is that all “messiahs” are, by definition, persons ofhigh dominance, and persons of high dominance are usually highly sexed. This isas true in the case of female as male messiahs – the best illustration being thecareer of a woman who was often called “the world’s most pulchritudinousevangelist”.The Downfall of Aimée Semple McPhersonShe was born Aimée Elizabeth Kennedy, on a small farm in Canada, near Ingersoll,Ontario, on 9 October 1890. Her mother, a highly dominant woman, had been aSalvation Army lass until she married a devout farmer many years her senior.Aimée, like her mother, had a determined character, and there was a great dealof conflict between them in her childhood. Minnie Kennedy – later known as “Ma”– found marriage to her elderly husband boring and frustrating and took it outon her family.At the age of seventeen Aimée fell in love with a young English evangelist namedRobert Semple and married him, in spite of her mother’s objections. Sempleintended to become a missionary and apparently felt that she would make an idealwife. She joined her husband in his evangelist activities in Chicago, then theywent to England to see his parents. But when they arrived in Hong Kong, where heintended to begin his missionary work, Semple was stricken with fever and diedin the English hospital. Aimée gave birth to a girl soon afterwards. The Chinamission provided funds to send her back to America.She joined her parents, who had moved to New York, tried life on the farm inCanada, then returned to New York and married a grocery clerk named HaroldMcPherson, by whom she had a son. Marriage bored her and within eighteen monthsshe was on the move again, following the only profession she knew – that ofevangelist. In Canada, she attracted a crowd by standing on a chair at a streetcorner, her eyes closed and her arms raised in prayer. As the crowd waited insilent expectation, Aimée suddenly opened her eyes and yelled, “Follow me!” andrushed to the revival hall. Once the crowd was in she shouted, “Shut the doors.Don’t let anyone out.”For the next few years, it was a rather discouraging routine of travellingaround the country in a battered old car with a tent in the back. Her motherjoined her and took the collections. Aimée preached the literal truth of everyword in the Bible and the personal return of Jesus Christ. Slowly, she acquireda following. She began to hire lecture halls. Then, in 1917, at the age oftwenty-seven, she made the momentous decision to head for California. In her oldcar, with her mother and two children, she made her way slowly across thecountry.Aimée was not, in fact, “pulchritudinous”; her features were too heavy, and herlegs were like those of a Welsh dresser (so she always wore long skirts). But bythe usual standards of female evangelists, she was a welcome change. Within aweek of arriving in Los Angeles, she was able to rent the PhilharmonicAuditorium, which held over 3,000 people. Suddenly she was a celebrity. The richcontralto voice could hold the multitudes. On a new wave of confidence, shetravelled to Canada, New Zealand and Australia. It seems to have dawned on herthat American sales techniques could be used to sell religion. Back inCalifornia, this time in San Diego, she scattered evangelical tracts from anaircraft and held meetings in a boxing arena.It was in San Diego that Aimée suddenly became far more than a successfulpreacher. San Diego was full of old and retired citizens and the suicide rateand the statistics for mental and physical illness were far higher than in therest of California. At an outdoor meeting in Organ Pavilion, in Balboa Park, amiddle-aged paralytic rose from her wheelchair in front of 30,000 people andtook a few halting steps.Suddenly, hundreds of people were hobbling towards the platform, tears streamingdown their faces, praising the Lord and Aimée Semple McPherson. The next day,everyone in San Diego was talking about the miracle.Aimée embarked on another triumphant tour of the Pacific coast. Then sherealized it was time to stop moving around like a travelling showman. She wouldbuild a temple in Los Angeles. In 1923, Los Angeles was not the world’s mostsprawling city; it was still an enormous village, full of country folk. Theywelcomed the idea of an evangelical temple, and contributed generously. On 1January 1923, trumpets blared, and Aimée unveiled the floodlit, electricallyrotating cross that formed the heart of the Angelus Temple; by night it could beseen fifty miles away. The Temple, and Sister Aimée’s house next door, had costabout $1½ million. The Temple had a seating capacity of 5,000, a broadcastingstation, a theological seminary, an enormous organ, and a “Miracle Room” full ofdiscarded crutches. Groups of disciples engaged in non-stop prayer,participating in relays. Aimée, with a genius that owed something to Hollywood(and to which Billy Graham undoubtedly owes some of his own methods), heldpageants with music, picture-shows of the Holy Land, and dramatized sermons, allaccompanied by a vast choir. Her neighbour Carey McWilliams remarkedfelicitously that, “Aimée kept the Ferris wheels and merry-go-rounds of religionturning night and day.” At the end of her sermons, she asked sinners to comeforward to be saved; as the lights were lowered, and soft music soothed theaudience, hundreds rose to their feet and moved down the aisles. Then Aiméewould shout, “Turn on the lights and clear the one-way street for Jesus,” andsuddenly the music would turn into a brazen blare. Aimée was one of the earth’sgreat showmen. For sheer entertainment her meetings surpassed anything thatcould be seen in the cinemas.It was in 1925 that a new radio operator took over the Temple’s radio station.His name was Kenneth G. Ormiston and he had a soothing, cultivated voice. Atfirst, Aimée spoke to him only over the headphones; then they met by the Templesteps and she drove him home to his wife. But soon Ormiston was no longerhurrying home to his wife once the programmes were over. Instead, he went to aroom in the Ambassador Hotel, where Sister Aimée was waiting. In 1926 Aimée wenton a visit to the Holy Land, financed by “love offerings” from her followers.Ormiston was absent from California during this period, although it is not knownfor certain whether he travelled with Aimée. She was back in Los Angeles in May1926, and continued her clandestine meetings with Ormiston in various hotels. On14 May Ormiston rented a cottage in Carmel, told the landlord that he would bereturning with his “invalid wife”, and went back to Los Angeles.Four days later, Aimée disappeared. She had gone to the beach at Venice for aswim. She sat in a beach tent, working on sermon notes, and after a while, shesent her secretary off on some errand. When the secretary returned, Aimée hadvanished. Her mother proclaimed from the steps of the Temple, “She is with Jesus– pray for her.” For the next thirty-two days, her followers mounted a franticsearch. Aircraft flew close to the waves; men in diving suits looked for herbody on the ocean floor. Two followers committed suicide – a young man yelled“I’m going after her” and leapt into the sea. Aimée’s mother had flowersscattered from an aircraft on the spot. A collection of $36,000 was taken for amemorial.On 27 May, a newspaper mentioned that Ormiston had also vanished; his wife hadreported him missing. Further probing by reporters revealed that he had alsobeen absent when Aimée was in the Holy Land. As all Los Angeles began to buzzwith indecent rumour and speculation, Ormiston strolled into the searchheadquarters, denied all knowledge of Aimée’s disappearance and vanished again.The police of California began to suspect that there might be a connectionbetween Aimée and Ormiston, and that if they could find one they would find theother. Suddenly the search was intensified. On the morning of 29 May Ormistoncalled at a Salinas garage, near Carmel, to collect his car; he was accompaniedby a woman, and later that day, they registered as “Mr and Mrs Frank Gibson” ata hotel in St Luis Obispo. That night their car was stopped by a suspiciousnewspaper reporter. Ormiston turned and headed back towards San Francisco. Fivedays later, on 23 June 1926, a resident of a cottage in Agua Prieta, just acrossthe Mexican border from Douglas, Arizona, was awakened by a knocking at thedoor, to be confronted by a woman who claimed she had been the victim of akidnapping. It was Aimée.Her story was that she had been kidnapped by two men and a woman – Rose, Steveand Jake. She had been taken to a shack in Mexico and had eventually escaped.When she returned to Los Angeles, 30,000 people were waiting at the station andshe was carried to her car through lanes of flowers. Her followers showed atendency to forgive and forget, and the rest of the world might have done thesame, if Aimée had not tried quite so hard to prove her innocence.She kept asking what the police were doing to find the kidnappers and issuedchallenges over the radio. A grand jury declared that there was no evidence toindict anyone. Soon after that, someone tracked down her “love nest” in Cannel.Ormiston, who was still in hiding, sent an affidavit stating that although hehad stayed in the cottage with a woman who was not his wife, that woman was notAimée. This seemed to be confirmed when a woman announced that the lady inquestion was her sister; Aimée publicly declared herself vindicated. But whenthe lady proved to be wanted by the police for passing bad cheques, the pressonce again showed a disposition to regard Aimee as an adulterous woman who haddecided to brazen it out. Another grand jury was convened; this time, a followerof Aimée’s vanished to the lavatory with a major piece of evidence – a scrap ofpaper found in the “love nest” with Aimée’s writing on it – and flushed it downthe toilet. The grand jury was dismissed. Finally, Aimée was charged withconspiring with others to obstruct justice. She raised a “fight the Devil fund”of $¼ million, explaining to her followers that she was being crucified by theforces of evil. The evidence against her looked overwhelming; chambermaidstestified about her sessions in hotel rooms with Ormiston and the hotelregisters left no doubt about it. She was identified as the “Mrs Mcintyre” ofthe Carmel “love nest”, and the cheque-bouncing lady who had supportedOrmiston’s story now admitted she had been paid by Aimée, who had carefullycoached her in her story. And yet, in spite of all this, District Attorney AsaKeyes suddenly moved to dismiss the case against her – there was talk of a$30,000 bribe. (Keyes was later sentenced to prison for corruption in office.)Aimée announced that the Lord had rescued her and settled down to writing herautobiography, In the Service of the King, in which she repeated the kidnappingstory.Soon after this, Aimée set out on another lecture tour; this time the subjectwas her own life and she expected her audiences to pay for admission. To hersurprise, few people seemed inclined to do this. It was the same when she wenton a European tour in 1928. The faithful continued to regard Sister Aimée as asaint and a wronged woman, but the general public seemed to regard her with acynical amusement. Her publicity stunts, her public quarrels (with her mother,among others) and her lawsuits began to bore even the American press. Shechartered a liner for a crusade to the Holy Land but only a hundred followersturned up. For this occasion, Aimée had her chestnut hair bleached to blonde;her mother was indiscreet enough to mention that she had also had her facelifted and this alienated more of the faithful than the kidnapping escapade. In1931, she decided to ignore her own teaching on divorce – she had alwaysinsisted that no divorced person should remarry during the lifetime of the otherpartner – and married an overweight radio announcer named Dave Hutton. Two daysafter the wedding, another woman sued Hutton for $200,000 for breach of promise.When the case was tried, Hutton was ordered to pay $5,000. But when she heardthe news, Aimée fainted and fractured her skull on the flagstone of thecourtyard. She went to Europe to recuperate. Hutton sent her a telegram: “Takeyour time, honey . . . Daddy wants a well woman.” But she and Hutton never livedtogether again.During the remainder of her life, she was sued fifty-five times in the courts ofLos Angeles for unpaid bills, broken contracts, slander and other charges. Therewere a number of successful suits by relatives of Temple followers who had lefttheir money to Aimée. She was as flamboyant as ever and as she grew older, herstyle in clothes became increasingly girlish, but the world had ceased to beinterested in her.On the morning of 27 September 1944, Aimée Semple McPherson was foundunconscious in her hotel room in Oakland, California, with sleeping capsulesscattered around her on the floor; she died later in the day. It was neverestablished whether she had taken an overdose deliberately or accidentally.Krishna VentaIn 1911, precisely one century after the birth of the Reverend Prince, anothermessiah, Francis Pencovic, was born in America. Up to the time of World War IIhe had a curious and chequered career as a boilermaker, shipyard worker anddishwasher, and had served jail sentences for burglary, larceny, passing dudcheques, not supporting his wife, and sending a threatening letter to Roosevelt.It was during the war, when he was a conscientious objector, that he organized acult called the Fountain of the World, followed by the initials WKFL (wisdom,knowledge, faith and love). When he came out of the army he changed his name toKrishna Venta, adopted flowing oriental robes, and explained that he had beenborn in a valley in Nepal.He had visited Rome as long ago as AD 600 – although, on a more recent visit,the Pope’s guards had turned him away – and had been “teleported” to America in1932. The cult, with a hundred or so members, settled in Ventura County,California, near Box Canyon. According to Krishna Venta, America would be shakenby a Communist revolution in 1965, and in 1975 he and his 144,000 followerswould take over the country.On 9 December 1958, two disgruntled ex-followers, Ralph Miller and PeterKamenoff, called on Krishna Venta in his San Fernando Valley retreat, anddemanded that he confess that his messianism was basically a cloak for sexualpromiscuity – their own wives having been among the messiah’s “brides”. WhenKrishna declined to confess, one of the men opened a canvas bag – and atremendous explosion blew the “monastery” apart, killing a dozen people andinjuring many more. In a pick-up truck nearby, police found a tape recordingmade by the two “avengers”, listing the prophet’s misdemeanours, and declaring:“He isn’t Christ, only a man.” The words could serve as the epitaph of manicmessiahs in general.***The Flat Earth Society flourished in Britain until the early 1970s, when Samueland Lillian Shenton, its last active exponents, died. The belief of the Society,that the earth is self-evidently not a sphere, has been around far longer thanthe scientifically sanctioned opposing view. The Flat Earthers’ arguments tendto centre around the “fact” that if our planet was indeed a fast-rotating ball,we would all fly off it into space. Furthermore they stress that the Bibleportrays the earth as flat. In order to promote their views, Flat Earthers havealways been quite prepared to fight scientists on their own territory.Throughout the nineteenth century, British planists (Flat Earthers) andglobularists (round earthers) had experimental showdowns, complete withimpartial observers, along a six-mile stretch of canal known as the BedfordLevel. The results were often disturbing for orthodox science. In one experimenta fifteen-foot-square blanket was hung from a bridge spanning the canal.Meanwhile, six miles down the straight waterway at another bridge, an observerattempted to focus his telescope upon the blanket. Globularist science dictatesthat the curvature of the earth over six miles should result in the observer notbeing able to see the blanket at all. However, a photo taken through thetelescope revealed not only the entire blanket, but its reflection in the waterbelow.The first photographs of earth from space should have convinced the FlatEarthers of their error, but they had a ready explanation: the entire spaceprogramme was a sham, Arthur C. Clarke had been hired to script the moonlanding. The Americans had been given the role of space race winners at a TopSecret meeting with the Soviets, in return for handing over Cuba without anyfuss.The Flat Earth Society still exists in America, crusading against the heathenglobularist conspiracy.***Brother TwelveWith Brother Twelve – whose real name was Edward Arthur Wilson – we againencounter the paradox of a messiah who cannot be dismissed entirely as aself-receiver. Born in 1878 in Birmingham, England, Wilson was the son of“Irvingites”. Edward Irving was a Scottish minister who was appointed to theCaledonian Church in London’s Hatton Garden in 1822; convinced that the SecondComing was imminent, he induced in his congregation tremendous transports ofreligious fervour. When, in 1830, they offered up prayers for some “sign” ormiracle, his congregation began “speaking in tongues” – that is, in strangelanguages, sometimes gobbledegook, but sometimes foreign languages with whichthey were unfamiliar. The “voices” told Irving that he was to be the new Isaiah,and that in forty days’ time, he would have the power to work miracles. But theforty days passed, and the miraculous power failed to descend. Generaldisillusion followed; in 1833 he was dismissed, and in the following year diedof tuberculosis.As to Edward Wilson, born almost half a century later, he had been “in touchwith super-physical beings” from an early age, but this did not prevent him fromgoing to sea and working as a “blackrider” – transporting kidnapped negroes toTurkey where they were sold as slaves. In 1912 he deserted his wife and childrenand became a wanderer. And twelve years later, at the age of forty-six, he foundhimself in a village in the south of France. On 19 October 1924, he woke up andsaw a “Tau” – a cross with a circle on top – suspended at the end of the bed.Thinking it was some kind of after-image, he closed his eyes and looked again;now there was also a five pointed star below it. Slowly, they faded away. But ashe lay in the silence, he heard a faraway voice, “clear and wonderfully sweet”,which told him that he had been a pharaoh in Egypt (the Tau, or ankh, is theEgyptian symbol of life), and ordered him to prepare his heart for illumination.In the following year, he began to practise “automatic writing”, whose authoridentified himself as a “Master of Wisdom”, a spiritual being who, according tothe teaching of Madame Blavatsky (founder of the Theosophical Society), is partof a Great White Lodge whose purpose is to guide human destiny. The result was abook called The Three Truths. This Master gave Wilson the name “Brother Twelve”.When he sent an article called “The Shadow” to the Occult Review in London, itwas immediately accepted, and when it appeared in 1926, it created aconsiderable stir. Wilson foretold that a new age would begin in 1975, but thatbefore that the world would have to struggle through an abyss of horror – aprophecy that was, on the whole, remarkably accurate.In May 1926, at the time of the General Strike, Wilson went to London, andcalled on the Occult Review. The editor was so impressed by him (Wilson was asmall man with a pointed beard, twinkling eyes, and a manner of self-evidentsincerity) that he accepted a book called The Message, and lost no time inprinting it. As its fame spread, Brother Twelve began to acquire disciples. InJanuary 1927 he informed thern, (through a “general letter”) that he had beenordered by the Master to go to Canada.In Ottawa, Wilson lectured to a packed meeting of the Theosophical Society,where he announced that the Masters had ordered him to form an “AquarianFoundation” and to prepare for important work. The talk was received withenthusiasm, and dozens of members announced their eagerness to join. It was thesame when he lectured in Toronto, where – to the disgust of the TheosophicalSociety – crowds of members signed up. In Windsor, Ontario, his charm won over apublisher who agreed to act as intermediary between the messiah and his growingaudience. In Vancouver he was met off the boat by another admirer, a lawyer, andwas soon living in a small rented house and selecting members for the governingboard of the Aquarian Foundation (seven of them, including himself).Appeals for funds brought a flood of donations to build a Centre in Nanaimo,British Columbia. This was run by Wilson and his common-law wife Elma. Theiraim, he told members, was to fight the Empire of Evil that had been engineeringcatastrophes for mankind since ancient times – it had caused the downfall ofRome, and its latest effort was Bolshevism. Brother Twelve also shared withHitler the conviction that the Jews were part of an international Communistconspiracy. But his detestations were impartial, and included the Roman CatholicChurch.As the money poured in, Wilson decided to buy four hundred acres on nearbyValdes Island, and build an “ashram”. He also made a determined attempt tobecome a political force, sending his representatives to talk to US senators,and publishing pamphlets urging the importance of forming a “Third Party”, to becalled the PPL, or Protestant Protective League. But the attempt to gain thesupport of a minority group called the Prohibition Party foundered at a Chicagoconvention in 1928, and Wilson reluctantly relinquished his political ambitions.When he returned to the Centre he took with him a mistress he had acquired onthe train journey, Myrtle Baumgartner. But she was quickly hustled off to ValdesIsland where – Wilson told his closest confidants – she would give birth to achild who would be the new Christ. When the other disciples found out about her,there were murmurs of indignation – the first sign of the dissension that woulddestroy Brother Twelve’s empire. They even refused to be convinced when he toldthem that he and Myrtle had been married in ancient Egypt. Elma Wilson – thediscarded wife – was sent off to Switzerland to organize another Foundation. Buther rival’s days were numbered – after two miscarriages, she was also sentpacking.Meanwhile, an article in the Foundation newsletter expounding Brother Twelve’sinspired revelations on “spiritual marriage” caused even more hostility. A fewdays later, the other six “Governors” told Brother Twelve that they had decidedto dissolve the Foundation.Ironically, it was Wilson’s talent for organization that had proved to be hisAchilles’ heel. The disciples had worked and contributed money – sometimes afortune. Naturally, they felt they had a say in what happened. Moreover, by law,the assets of the Foundation had to be distributed among the seven Governors.Wilson was understandably indignant – after all, he was the founder – but atleast he had recently collected another $25,000 from a rich admirer called MaryConnally.When his treasurer, Robert England, defected, and took with him $2,800 that heconsidered Brother Twelve owed him in wages, the angry messiah swore out awarrant for his arrest on a charge of embezzlement. England was intercepted ashe was leaving the country and jailed. Next, Wilson appointed four of hissupporters to the now depleted Board of Governors, so he was able to outvote theremaining four. These promptly obtained an injunction freezing the $45,000assets of the society.Brother Twelve was becoming paranoid. Disciples noted that he had changed forthe worse, and attributed this to the fact that after he had taken the “SixthInitiation”, Brother Twelve had come under the influence of a Black Adept on thespiritual plane. When Robert England was set free by the court, Wilson wasfurious; soon after that, England vanished, leaving all his effects behind.There is no proof that Brother Twelve had anything to do with his disappearance,but it remains a distinct possibility. At this time, Brother Twelve was foundnot guilty of appropriating $13,000 of the society’s funds.On 6 December 1928, Brother Twelve gave a demonstration of what certainly lookedlike magical powers. An ex-disciple was suing him for $450 in back wages. As onewitness stood up in the box, he began to shake, and crashed to the floor. At thesame time, several people at the back of the courtroom fainted. And when theprosecuting lawyer rose to his feet a few minutes later, he stared blankly infront of him, then began to stammer. He finally managed to gasp: “This isridiculous, but I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” He shuffled back to hisseat looking puzzled and bewildered.The judge awarded a verdict in favour of Brother Twelve. But there was a generalfeeling that his days were numbered. And when one of his followers was arrestedfor raping a cinema usherette, newspapers predicted that his career wasfinished.Ignoring these prophecies, Brother Twelve and the remaining faithful disciplesset up a colony on Valdes Island, where a millionaire disciple named RogerPainter came to join him, bringing a red-headed volatile woman named MabelSkottowe. She and Wilson soon became lovers; Painter beat her brutally, and wasordered to leave. Mabel changed her name to “Madame Zee”, and moved in with themessiah. But her bad temper – she carried a riding crop and used it unsparinglyon the disciples – caused mutterings of rebellion. By now Wilson had purchasedthe neighbouring De Courcy Island, which had a harbour, and Mary Connally alsopresented him with a 160-acre property in San Bernardino, California.When Wilson and Madame Zee moved to De Courcy Island, leaving the disciplesbehind, real disaffection began to set in. The disciples were expected to worklong hours at building and gardening, and many of them looked forward to the daywhen they had enough money to leave. When he learned about this, Wilson preachedan impassioned sermon about greed and treachery, and cowed them into handingover their savings.Towards the end of 1929, Brother Twelve and Madame Zee took a year-long holidayin Europe. The island dwellers were glad to see them back – until they realizedthat Brother Twelve was more paranoid than ever. There were sudden andunprovoked “purges” of disciples, and when his “wife” Elma returned from herproselytizing expedition in Switzerland, she was forbidden to rejoin the colony.Even Wilson’s benefactress Mary Connally was made to do domestic chores andfarmwork.Brother Twelve seemed to be developing his own brand of sexual mysticism; heordered disciples to “pair up”, because sex was part of the process of“initiation”. One new female disciple, Isona Supelveda, became his mistress, butwas upset when her thirteen-year-old daughter was raped by one of the males.Another daughter had to flee in the middle of the night from the middle-aged manwho had been assigned to be her lover. Brother Twelve took in her attractivefourteen-year-old son Dion and allegedly seduced him. When Wilson grew tired ofIsona, she fled the colony and reported the rape to the police. That night, Dionstole a speedboat from the mainland and tried to return to Brother Twelve – hedeclared later that he had been hypnotized and ordered to return at whatevercost. (One disciple was to describe how she had seen Madame Zee exercise “mentalpower” over Dion; the boy was running towards Brother Twelve’s cabin when MadameZee stared after him and mentally ordered him to stop; Dion stopped in histracks – an episode that suggests that Madame Zee may have been responsible forthe problems in court.) But the rape charge was dropped, and, incredibly, theSepulveda family returned to the island.In the following year, 1932, an increasingly paranoid Wilson ordered thedisciples to stop construction work, and to start building fortifications. Healso purchased a case of carbines and some ammunition. But the siege he expected– the state government was considering criminal charges – never materialized.Instead, some bewildered and exhausted disciples fled to the mainland, whileothers presented Wilson with a letter telling him that they were at the end oftheir tether. Wilson flew into a rage; then decided to cast off the rebels; hebegan taking them back to the mainland in small boatloads. Those ejected fromEden included Mary Connally.This was the last straw. The homeless ones went to a local law firm andinstituted proceedings. In April 1933, Mary Connally was awarded $26,500, andanother litigant, Alfred Barley (one of the earliest disciples) $14,232.But it was too late. Brother Twelve and Madame Zee had already absconded withthe cash. They moved to a farmhouse in Devon, then to Neuchâtel in Switzerland.And on 7 November 1934, Wilson died in his apartment there. Madame Zee had himcremated, then left Neuchâtel. With the remainder of Brother Twelve’s fortune(about $400,000), she seems to have spent her remaining years in comfort inluxury hotels.The defectors in Vancouver refused to believe the news – they were certain thatWilson had “fabricated” his death. But in spite of a number of allegedsightings, Brother Twelve was never to reappear.In 1991, his amazing history was reconstructed from memories of disciples byVancouver writer John Oliphant in a book called Brother Twelve. It is probablythe most remarkably detailed case history of a “false messiah” that has everbeen compiled.The Ku Klux KlanDuring the chaos and maladministration that followed the end of the AmericanCivil War in 1865, the social order in the defeated Southern states waseffectively turned upside down. Former slaves were not only given the vote, theywere given virtual freedom to take revenge on their old masters.Gangs of ex-slaves and opportunists from the North (nicknamed “Carpetbaggers”)pillaged, raped and murdered almost under the noses of the occupying Federaltroops. Where punishment took place it was often ludicrously light and thewhites grumbled that there was one law for “niggers” and another for “decentwhite folks”. Into this gap in the justice system stepped former General NathanBedford Forrest and his Klansmen.Forrest (who had distinguished himself during the war by ordering the massacreof over 200 surrendered black Union troops at Fort Pillow in April 1864) toldthe Klansmen to dress themselves and even their horses in white shrouds; thus toconvince the superstitious and poorly educated blacks that they were theavenging ghosts of Confederate soldiers.The Klan saw themselves as modern knights, dedicated to the Southern code ofhonour. Indeed, in the beginning, they made some effort to catch the realoffenders and the beatings generally outnumbered the lynchings, but their verypopularity eventually brought about their collapse.By the 1870s, the Klan membership had swelled to tens of thousands and Forrest’s“secret army” was totally unmanagable. He watched with growing disgust as Klanposses looted and butchered almost indiscriminately among the black communitiesacross the South and, along with his staff he resigned in 1872. With the changein the political climate at the time (i.e. the North selling off the blacks’rights in return for economic agreement with the South), the Klan’s reason forexistence vanished and it soon died out. It did not, however, stay dead.In 1915, coinciding with the release of D. W. Griffith’s apparently pro-Klanmovie, Birth of a Nation, an Atlanta Methodist preacher, “Colonel” WilliamJoseph Simmons, started to agitate for a rebirth of the “noble order”. Hereceived widespread support and the new Ku Klux Klan soon had a rocketingmembership. This time, though, its interests were not in the restoration ofsocial order, but the instigation of racial hatred.Simmons’s and his fellows’ vitriol was not just aimed at the blacks; Catholics,Jews, non-Americans and all critics of the Ku Klux Klan were also attacked. Thisbroad appeal base swelled the movement to hundreds of thousands throughout theFirst World War and on into the next two decades. At the same time, its leadersbecame stunningly rich by skimming the Klan’s funds. By the 1930s, the Klan wasone of the most powerful financial institutions in the USA.The cost to human life exacted by this hate machine was appalling. The actualnumber of lynchings and burnings is unknown – partially due to cover-ups byKlan-friendly police departments – but other atrocities, deliberately publicizedby the Klan, were also common. Whippings, shootings, mutilations, rapes andbrandings with the letters “KKK” were common throughout the 1920s and 1930s. TheGovernment seemed powerless or unwilling to stop the persecutions.Then, with the coming of the Second World War, membership started to drop off.In an attempt to revive their fortunes, the Klan leaders forged an alliance withthe Nazi American Bund. When the Bund was denounced as un-American and disbandedthe Klan tried to erase its links with the group, but it was too late; the mudstuck and membership crashed. In 1944, the Internal Revenue Service charged theKlan with failure to pay massive back taxes; this was the final straw. On 23April 1944, the Klan leaders officially dissolved the movement; but, again, itrefused to die.Separate groups of Ku Klux Klansmen managed to keep the ugly dream alivethroughout the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s the movement received a boostduring the civil rights troubles, but stood little chance of a full revival. Themood of the country had changed, and it was now the racists who were looked uponwith distrust and loathing.In the 1970s and 1980s the Klan hung on, but has undergone several importantchanges. Its new emphasis is on religious fundamentalism (which was always apart of its belief, but never the backbone, which had always been racism) andpost-nuclear Survivalism. The new creed predicts that the forces of Satan (ledby Jews, Communists and non-whites) will cause a nuclear Armageddon which willbe followed by a war between the powers of Good and Evil. In the preparation forthis day, the modern Ku Klux Klan has set up several paramilitary training campsin the Southern states.Charles MansonA former Brother Twelve disciple alleged in court that Wilson had ordered him tokill one of his enemies by black magic, but that he had refused. In thatrespect, at least, Wilson had a less malign influence than Charles Manson, the“hippie” messiah of the 1960s.Manson was born in Cincinnati in 1934, the son of a fifteen-year-old girl whohad become pregnant by her seventeen-year-old boyfriend. His mother was reportedby neighbours to be “loose”. “She ran around a lot, drank, got in trouble.” Shealso vanished for days at a time. When Charlie was five, she was sentenced tofive years in prison for armed robbery. Out again in 1942, she tried to have herson taken into a foster home, but none were available; at twelve, he was sent toa “caretaking institution” for boys in Indiana. After running away several times– his mother did not want him at home – he was arrested for burglary; escapingfrom custody he committed a series of burglaries and armed robberies, for whichhe was sent to a reform school when he was thirteen. A parole officer latersaid: “Charlie was the most hostile parolee I’ve ever come across.” Small andnot particularly strong, Manson was nevertheless a highly dominant person whofelt that his best defence was to “act tough”. He also committed a number ofhomosexual offences, including rape, holding a razor against the victim’sthroat.Released from reformatory at twenty, he married a seventeen-year-old girl anddrove her to Los Angeles in a stolen car; in March 1956, a son was born. Threemonths later Manson was sent to prison again. for car theft. He was behind barsintermittently until 1967, when he was thirty-two.Free once more, he drifted to San Francisco, which was then crowded with“hippies” who smoked pot and talked about flower power. For Manson, this was arevelation; the world had changed totally since 1956. Older than most of thedrop-outs on Haight-Ashbury, he was soon a local “character”, with his ownadmiring retinue of teenagers. He took full advantage of the new sexual freedom,and accumulated a kind of harem. One girl, Mary Brunner, was later described ashis “favourite wife”. Another, Lynn (“Squeaky”) Fromme, joined his ménage whenhe found her crying by the side of the road after a family row. Yet another,Susan Atkins, later described how Manson had given her confidence by making herundress, then telling her: “Look, you’re beautiful.” What such girls foundattractive about Manson was that he was a totally unthreatening father figure, akind of mixture of Charlie Chaplin and Christ. He liked to point out that hisname meant “Man’s son”, and clearly thought of himself as a Christ figure.By October 1967, Manson was tired of Haight-Ashbury, and moved with hisdisciples to Topanga Canyon, Los Angeles. There were about sixteen girls in thegroup by this time, and four men. One of the girls, Sandy Good, told him about aranch owned by in old man named George Spahn, who was almost blind. Manson wentto look at it, and Spahn allowed the hippies to stay for several weeks.Manson’s ambition was to become a pop star, like Bob Dylan; he played guitar andsang his own songs. Terry Meicher, son of the film star Doris Day, talked abouta $20,000 record contract. Manson sold a song to the successful pop group, theBeach Boys, whose drummer, Dennis Wilson, allowed the “family” to move into hisluxury home for a while. It suddenly began to look as if Manson might end uprich and famous too.Another coup was persuading the owner of a small ranch near the Spahn ranch togive it to them – while they were all under the influence of drugs – in exchangefor a painted tent.But success continued to elude him, and he developed an increasing tendency todenounce civilization and all its evils. He was convinved that a nuclearholocaust was imminent and that blacks were poised to take over America. (Oddlyenough, Manson was violently racist.) In October 1968, the “family” drove an oldbus into Death Valley, in the Mojave desert, until the brakes burned out, thenmoved into a derelict farm, the Barker ranch. When winter came they moved backto Los Angeles, and Manson’s next-door neighbour commented that he was veryopinionated and very anti-establishment, and that Manson’s women said “theywould give their lives for Charlie”.It seems likely that at this period Manson’s non-stop psychedelic trips began toinduce intense paranoia (although even at reform school psychiatrists had notedsome paranoia). The Beatles song “Helter Skelter” provided him with a code namefor the day of reckoning for the “pigs” – the bourgeoisie, the blacks and theauthorities. The family began to acquire guns and knives, and two “dune buggies”– vehicles that would run on sand – one with a forged cheque and one with stolenmoney. In 1969, he shot a negro dope dealer named Crowe in the torso – althoughCrowe recovered in hospital and no questions were asked. Manson was relievedwhen no Black Panthers came to seek revenge.In July 1969, a Zen Buddhist convert called Gary Hinman – who had refused tosell all he had and join the family – was held at gunpoint while the familysearched his home for money. When Hinman showed fight, Manson slashed his facewith a sword half severing an ear. After that, Hinman was forced to sign overhis car and bus to Manson, then stabbed twice and left to bleed to death.The police were now harassing the “family”, who were back at the Spahn ranch –looking for stolen cars and stolen credit cards. In early August 1969, Mansontold his followers: “Now is the time for Helter Skelter.”On the evening of Friday, 8 August, a murder party of four left for a house inHollywood where Terry Melcher had once lived; Manson chose it because he knewit. Tex Watson, Linda Kasabian, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel drove to10050 Cielo Drive, and Watson cut the telephone wires. The house had now beenlet to film director Roman Polanski, who was in London, and his wife Sharon Tatewas giving dinner to three guests: Jay Sebring, an ex-lover, Voityck Frykowski,and his girlfriend Abigail Folger, who were staying. Sharon Tate was heavilypregnant.A youth named Stephen Parent, who had been visiting the house boy, drove downthe drive on his way home and called to ask the dark figures what was happening.Tex Watson shot him five times in the head. Then they broke into the house bycutting through a screen window.Frykowski had fallen asleep on the settee under the influence of drugs; AbigailFolger had retired to bed for the same reason. Sebring was talking to SharonTate in her bedroom. Watson woke Frykowski up and ordered Susan Atkins to tiehis hands. Sebring came downstairs asking what was happening and made a grab forthe gun; Watson shot him in the lung. Then a rope was thrown over a beam andtied round the necks of Sebring, Abigail Folger and Sharon Tate. As Sebringbegan to struggle, Watson stabbed him several times. Frykowski began to run, andwas shot in the back, then clubbed. Abigail Folger, also running, was stabbed byPatricia Krenwinkel. Out in the garden, where Linda Kasabian was keeping watch,Frykowski was stabbed to death by Watson. Then, back in the house, Watsonignored Sharon Tate’s pleas for mercy and stabbed her in the breast. Finally,Susan Atkins wrote “Pig” in blood on the door, and they left.They stripped off their bloody clothes and washed themselves with a grasssprinkler on someone’s lawn; the elderly house owner came out and shooed themoff, noting the number of their car as they drove away.Later that night, Manson seems to have come to the house to make sure everyonewas dead. And the next morning, the family watched with delight as news of themurders was broadcast on television.The aim of Helter Skelter was to make whites believe that blacks were about tostart a massacre, and to massacre them in turn. It seemed logical to Manson thatif this was to be achieved, the murders had to be followed up as soon aspossible. That evening, seven family members, all high on “acid”, set out for awell-to-do area of Los Angeles, Los Feliz, and chose a house at random. But whenManson saw pictures of children through the window, he ordered them to move onto a house with an expensive car and a boat trailer outside. It was the home ofa middle-aged couple, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca.The LaBiancas had gone to bed when Charles Manson walked into their bedroom witha gun and ordered them to get up. He tied them up, then went back to the car andordered Watson, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten to go into the houseand kill them. He, meanwhile, would go off with the others and kill someoneelse.Watson and his helpers found the LaBiancas lying quietly. Mrs LaBianca was ledto a bedroom and tied with electric flex; then her husband was stabbed in thethroat. When Rosemary LaBianca screamed “What are you doing to my husband?”,Patricia Krenwinkel stabbed her in the back, severing her spine. Watson slashedthe word “War” on LaBianca’s chest while Patricia Krenwinkel stabbed both bodieswith a carving fork After it was clear the victims were dead, they scrawled“Death to pigs” and “Rise” – and a mis-spelled version of “Helter Skelter” – onthe wall, then took a shower, and fed the dogs (who had watched the murderswithout barking, and even licked their hands). They then hitch-hiked back to theSpahn ranch where Manson was waiting. The murders he had intended to commit hadbeen abandoned; in fact, he had left the girls in an apartment block with ordersto kill a film actor, but they had deliberately knocked on the wrong door andwent away again.The slaughter created the sensation Manson had hoped for – suddenly the sale ofhandguns and burglar alarms soared in Los Angeles. Six days later, the stolencar used in both crimes was seized by the police – but not in connection withthe murders; they had decided to swoop on the hippie commune in search of drugs,guns and stolen vehicles. Unfortunately, the man who had chased the Sharon Tatekillers off his lawn failed to report the incident to the police, otherwise thecase would probably have been solved immediately. Manson and twenty-four otherpeople were arrested, but released three days later for lack of evidence.On 26 August, less than two weeks after the murders, a Spahn ranch hand namedShorty O’Shea vanished; his body was never found, but it is believed that he wastortured and killed by the family because he had married a negro woman, andbecause he knew too much.In 12 September 1969, the family moved back to Death Valley. There they courtedthe attention of the police by wantonly burning a bulldozer belonging to thelocal rangers. Tyre tracks led them to a stolen car, and a miner told them aboutthe family (who had made an unsuccessful attempt to kill him). On 9 Octoberpolice surrounded the Barker ranch, then arrested everyone on it – mostly girls,who tried to disconcert them by removing their clothes and urinating. Mansonreturned to the ranch three days later, to be told about the arrests by a fewgirls who had escaped the raid. While he was eating, the police descended again.Manson almost escaped by hiding in a tiny cupboard under the kitchen sink, butwas detected.It was Susan Atkins, in prison in Los Angeles on suspicion of knowing somethingabout the Gary Hinman murder, who betrayed the family. She began to drop hintsto fellow prisoners ahout the Sharon Tate killings, and finally described themto her cellmate in detail. The cellmate reported this to another prisoner, whoreported it to the police. Under questioning, Susan Atkins was soon confessingthe whole story.The trial was one of the most expensive in Los Angeles history (although in thisrespect it was surpassed by the trial of the Hillside Stranglers, Buono andBianchi, ten years later). It had a slightly surrealistic air, since Mansonseemed to have no regard for normal logic, and insisted that they were innocentbecause society was guilty. Asked if she thought the killing of eight peopleunimportant, Susan Atkins asked if the killing of thousands of people withnapalm was important. Manson became a hero of the hippies, who saw him as afigure of social protest; there can be no doubt that if he had been released, hewould soon have had as huge a following as any messiah in history.Even after the arrests, the murders went on. Defence attorney Ronald Hughesdisappeared eight days into the trial; his badly decomposed body was found inthe desert at about the time of the sentencing; he had strongly disagreed withthe decision of Manson’s co-defendants to insist that he was not guilty. In hisbook Helter Skelter, prosecution attorney Vincent Bugliosi lists a dozen othermurders connected with the family, including those of two family membersbelieved to have killed Hughes.On 30 March 1970, Charles Manson, Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten and PatriciaKrenwinkel were sentenced to death; in 1971 Watson received the same sentence.In effect, this meant life imprisonment.In September 1975, Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme attempted to assassinate PresidentGerald Ford, but her gun misfired; she was sentenced to life imprisonment.In April 1992, Manson – now housed in a maximum security prison in the SanJoaquin Valley – made his eighth appeal for parole, but was turned down by theboard.Richard RamirezThroughout 1985 handgun sales in Los Angeles soared. Many suburbanites sleptwith a loaded pistol by their beds. A series of violent attacks upon citizens intheir own homes had shattered the comfortable normality of middle-class life.Formerly safe neighbourhoods seemed to be the killer’s favourite targets. Thewhole city was terrified.The attacks were unprecedented in many ways. Neither murder nor robbery seemedto be the obvious motive, although both frequently took place. The killer wouldbreak into a house, creep into the main bedroom and shoot the male partnerthrough the head with a .22. He would then rape and beat the wife or girlfriend,suppressing resistance with threats of violence to her or her children. Malechildren were sometimes sodomized, the rape victims sometimes shot. On occasion,he would ransack the house looking for valuables while at other times he wouldleave empty-handed without searching. During the attacks he would force victimsto declare their love for Satan. Survivors described a tall, slim Hispanic malewith black, greasy hair and severely decayed teeth. The pattern of crimes seemedto be based less upon a need to murder or rape but a desire to terrify andrender helpless. More than most serial killers the motive seemed to beexercising power.The killer also had unusual methods of victim selection. He seemed to bemurdering outside his own racial group, preferring Caucasians and specificallyAsians. He also seemed to prefer to break into yellow houses.In the spring and summer of 1985 there were more than twenty attacks, most ofwhich involved both rape and murder. By the end of March the press had picked upthe pattern and splashed stories connecting the series of crimes. After severalabortive nicknames, such as “The Walk-In Killer” or “The Valley Invader”, theHerald Examiner came up with “The Night Stalker”, a name sensational enough tostick.Thus all through the hot summer of 1985 Californians slept with their windowsclosed. One policeman commented to a reporter: “People are armed and staying uplate. Burglars want this guy caught like everyone else. He’s making it bad fortheir business.” The police themselves circulated sketches and stopped anyonewho looked remotely like The Night Stalker. One innocent man was stopped fivetimes.Despite these efforts and thorough forensic analysis of crime scenes there waslittle progress in the search for the killer’s identity.Things were obviously getting difficult for The Night Stalker as well. The nextmurder that fitted the pattern occurred in San Francisco, showing perhaps thatpublic awareness in Los Angeles had made it too taxing a location. This shiftalso gave police a chance to search San Francisco hotels for records of a man ofThe Night Stalker’s description. Sure enough, while checking the downmarketTenderloin district, police learned that a thin Hispanic with bad teeth had beenstaying at a cheap hotel there periodically over the past year. On the lastoccasion he had checked out the night of the San Francisco attack. The managercommented that his room “smelled like a skunk” each time he vacated it and ittook three days for the smell to clear.Though this evidence merely confirmed the police’s earlier description, TheNight Stalker’s next shift of location was to prove more revealing. A youngcouple in Mission Viejo were attacked in their home. The Night Stalker shot theman through the head while he slept, then raped his partner on the bed next tothe body. He then tied her up while he ransacked the house for money andjewellery. Before leaving he raped her a second time and force her to fellatehim with a gun pressed against her head. Unfortunately for the killer, however,his victim caught a glimpse of him escaping in a battered orange Toyota andmemorized the licence plate. She immediately alerted the police. LAPD filesshowed that the car had been stolen in Los Angeles’s Chinatown district whilethe owner was eating in a restaurant. An all-points bulletin was put out for thevehicle, and officers were instructed not to try and arrest the driver, merelyto observe him. However, the car was not found. In fact, The Night Stalker haddumped the car soon after the attack, and it was located two days later in a carpark in Los Angeles’s Rampart district. After plain-clothes officers had keptthe car under surveillance for twenty-four hours, the police moved in and tookthe car away for forensic testing. A set of fingerprints was successfullylifted.Searching police fingerprint files for a match manually can take many days andeven then it is possible to miss correlations. However, the Los Angeles policehad recently installed a fingerprint database computer system, designed by theFBI, and it was through this that they checked the set of fingerprints from theorange Toyota. The system works by storing information about the relativedistance between different features of a print, and comparing them with adigitized image of the suspect’s fingerprint. The search provided a positivematch and a photograph. The Night Stalker was a petty thief and burglar. Hisname was Ricardo Leyva Ramirez.The positive identification was described by the forensic division as “a nearmiracle”. The computer system had only just been installed, this was one of itsfirst trials. Furthermore, the system only contained the fingerprints ofcriminals born after 1 January 1960. Richard Ramirez was born in February 1960.The police circulated the photograph to newspapers, and it was shown on the lateevening news. At the time, Ramirez was in Phoenix, buying cocaine with the moneyhe had stolen in Mission Viejo. On the morning that the papers splashed his nameand photograph all over their front pages, he was on a bus on the way back toLos Angeles, unaware that he had been identified.He arrived safely and went into the bus station toilet to finish off the cocainehe had bought. No one seemed to be overly interested in him as he left thestation and walked through Los Angeles. Ramirez was a Satanist, and haddeveloped a belief that Satan himself watched over him, preventing his capture.At 8.15 a.m. Ramirez entered Tito’s Liquor Store at 819 Towne Avenue. Heselected some Pepsi and a pack of sugared doughnuts; he had a sweet tooth that,coupled with a lack of personal hygiene, had left his mouth with only a fewblackened teeth. At the counter other customers looked at him strangely as heproduced three dollar bills and awaited his change. Suddenly he noticed thepapers’ front pages, and his faith in Satan’s power must have been shaken. Hedodged out of the shop and ran, accompanied by shouts of, “It is him! Call thecops!” He pounded off down the street at a surprising speed for one soostensibly unhealthy. Within twelve minutes he had covered two miles. He hadheaded east. He was in the Hispanic district of Los Angeles.Ever since the police had confirmed that The Night Stalker was Hispanic therehad been a great deal of anger among the Hispanic community of Los Angeles. Theyfelt that racial stereotypes were already against them enough without theirbeing associated with psychopaths. Thus more than most groups, Hispanics wantedThe Night Stalker out of action.Ramirez, by now, was desperate to get a vehicle. He attempted to pull a womanfrom her car in a supermarket lot until he was chased away by some customers ofthe barber’s shop opposite. He carried on running though exhausted, into themore residential areas of east Los Angeles. There, he tried to steal a 1966 redMustang having failed to notice that the owner, Faustino Pinon, was lyingunderneath repairing it. As Ramirez attempted to start the car Pinon grabbed himby the collar and tried to pull him from the driver’s seat. Ramirez shouted thathe had a gun, but Pinon carried on pulling at him even after the car hadstarted, causing it to career into the gatepost. Ramirez slammed it into reverseand accelerated into the side of Pinon’s garage, and the vehicle stalled. Pinonsucceeded in wrenching Ramirez out of his car, but in the following struggleRamirez escaped, leaping the fence and running off across the road. There hetried to wrestle Angelina De La Torres from her Ford Granada. “Te voy a matar!(I’m going to kill you!)” screamed Ramirez. “Give me the keys!”, but again hewas thwarted and he ran away, now pursued by a growing crowd of neighbours.Manuel De La Torries, Angelina’s husband, succeeded in smashing Ramirez on thehead with a gate bar and he fell, but he managed to struggle up and set offrunning again before he could be restrained. Incredibly, when Ramirez haddeveloped a lead, he stopped, turned around and stuck his tongue out at hispursuers, then sped off once more. His stamina could not hold indefinitelyhowever, and it was De La Torres who again tackled him and held him down. It ispossible that Ramirez would have been lynched there and then had not a patrolmancalled to the scene arrived. Coincidentally the patrolman was the same age asthe killer, and he too was called Ramirez. He reached the scene just as TheNight Stalker disappeared under the mob. He drove his patrol car to within a fewfeet of where Ramirez was restrained, got out and prepared to handcuff thecaptive.“Save me. Please. Thank God you’re here. It’s me, I’m the one you want. Save mebefore they kill me,” babbled Ramirez. The patrolman handcuffed him and pushedhim into the back of the car. The crowd was becoming restless, and the car waskicked as it pulled away. Sixteen-year-old Felipe Castaneda, part of the mobthat captured Ramirez, remarked, “He should never, never have come to east LA.He might have been a tough guy, but he came to a tough neighbourhood. He wasHispanic. He should have known better.”“The Night Stalker” was in custody, at first in a police holding cell and thenin Los Angeles county jail. While in police care he repeatedly admitted to being“The Night Stalker” and begged to be killed.The case against Ramirez was strong. The murder weapon, a .22 semi-automaticpistol, was found in the possession of a woman in Tijuana, who had been given itby a friend of Ramirez. Police also tried to track down some of the jewellerythat Ramirez had stolen and fenced, by sending investigators to his birthplaceEl Paso, a spiralling town on the Texas–Mexico border. Questioning his familyand neighbours revealed that Ramirez’s early life had been spent in petty theftand smoking a lot of marijuana. He had never joined any of the rival teenagegangs that fight over territory throughout El Paso, preferring drugs andlistening to Heavy Metal. It had been common knowledge that Ramirez was aSatanist; a boyhood friend, Tom Ramos, said he believed that it was Bible-studyclasses that had turned the killer that way.The investigators also found a great deal of jewellery, stashed at the house ofRamirez’s sister Rosa Flores. The police were also hoping to find a pair of eyesthat Ramirez had gouged from one of his victims that had not been found in anyprevious searches. Unfortunately they were not recovered.The evidence against Ramirez now seemed unequivocal. In a controversial move,the mayor of Los Angeles said that whatever went on in court, he was convincedof Ramirez’s guilt. This was later to prove a mainstay in a defence argumentthat Ramirez could not receive a fair trial in Los Angeles.The appointed chief prosecutor in the case was deputy District Attorney P.Philip Halpin, who had prosecuted the “Onion Field” cop-killing case twentyyears earlier. Halpin hoped to end the trial and have Ramirez in the gas chamberin a relatively short period of time. The prosecutor drew up a set of initialcharges and submitted them as quickly as possible. A public defender wasappointed to represent Ramirez. However Ramirez’s family had engaged an El Pasolawyer, Manuel Barraza, and Ramirez eventually rejected his appointed publicdefender in favour of the El Paso attorney. Barrata did not even have a licenceto practise law in California.Ramirez accepted, then rejected three more lawyers, finally settling upon twodefenders, Dan and Arturo Hernandez. The two were not related, although theyoften worked together. The judge advised Ramirez that his lawyers did not evenmeet the minimum requirements for trying a death-penalty case in California, butRamirez insisted, and more than seven weeks after the initial charges werefiled, pleas of Not Guilty were entered on all counts.The Hernandezes and Ramirez seemed to be trying to force Halpin into making amistake out of sheer frustration, and thus to create a mis-trial. After eachhearing the Hernandez’ made pleas for, and obtained, more time to prepare theircase. Meanwhile one prosecution witness had died of natural causes, andRamirez’s appearance was gradually changing. He had had his hair permed and hisrotten teeth replaced. This naturally introduced more uncertainty into the mindsof prosecution witnesses as to Ramirez’s identity. The racial make-up of thejury was contested by the defence, which caused delays. The defence also argued,with some justification, that Ramirez could not receive a fair trial in LosAngeles, and moved for a change of location. Although the motion was refused itcaused yet more delays. It actually took three and a half years for Ramirez’strial to finally get under way.Halpin’s case was, in practical terms, unbeatable. The defence’s only realpossibility of success was in infinite delay. For the first three weeks of thetrial events progressed relatively smoothly. Then Daniel Hernandez announcedthat the trial would have to be postponed as he was suffering from nervousexhaustion. He had a doctor’s report that advised six weeks’ rest withpsychological counselling. It seemed likely that a mis-trial would be declared.Halpin tried to argue that Arturo Hernandez could maintain the defence, eventhough he had failed to turn up at the hearings and trial for the first sevenmonths. However this proved unnecessary as the judge made a surprise decisionand denied Daniel Hernandez his time off, arguing that he had failed to prove agenuine need.Halpin, by this stage was actually providing the Hernandezes with all theinformation that they required to mount an adequate defence, in order to movethings along and prevent mis-trial. For the same reasons the judge eventuallyappointed a defence co-counsel Ray Clark. Clark immediately put the defence on anew track: Ramirez was the victim of a mistaken identity. He even developed anacronym for this defence – SODDI or Some Other Dude Did It. When the defencecase opened, Clark produced testimony from Ramirez’s father that he had been inEl Paso at the time of one of the murders of which he was accused. He alsocriticized the prosecution for managing to prove that footprints at one of thecrime scenes were made by a size eleven-and-a-half Avia trainer, without everproving that Ramirez actually owned such a shoe. When the jury finally left todeliberate however, it seemed clear that they would find Ramirez guilty.Things were not quite that easy however. After thirteen days of deliberation,juror Robert Lee was dismissed for inattention and replaced by an alternativewho had also witnessed the case. Two days later, juror Phyllis Singletary wasmurdered in a domestic dispute. Her live-in lover had beaten her then shot herseveral times. She was also replaced.At last on 20 September 1989 after twenty-two days of deliberation the juryreturned a verdict of guilty on all thirteen counts of murder, twelve of thosein the first degree. The jury also found Ramirez guilty of thirty otherfelonies, including burglary, rape, sodomy and attempted murder. Asked byreporters how he felt after the verdict, Ramirez replied, “Evil.”There remained only the selection of sentence. At the hearing Clark argued thatRamirez might actually have been possessed by the devil, or that alternativelyhe had been driven to murder by over-active hormones. He begged the jury toimprison Ramirez for life rather than put him on death row. If the jury agreed,Clark pointed out, “he will never see Disneyland again,” surely punishmentenough. After five further days of deliberation, the jury voted for the deathpenalty. Again, reporters asked Ramirez how he felt about the outcome as he wasbeing taken away, “Big deal. Death always went with the territory. I’ll see youin Disneyland.”Any attempt to trace the source of Ramirez’s violent behaviour runs up againstan insurmountable problem. No external traumas or difficulties seem to havebrutalized him. He had a poor upbringing, he was part of a racial minority, butthese things alone cannot explain such an incredibly sociopathic personality.Ramirez seems to have created himself. He was an intelligent and deeplyreligious child. Having decided at some stage that counter-culture anddrug-taking provided a more appealing lifestyle, he developed pride in hisseparateness. In the El Paso of his early manhood, people would lock theirdoors, if they saw him coming down the street. He was known as “Ricky Rabon”,Ricky the thief, a nickname he enjoyed as he felt it made him “someone”. By thetime he moved to Los Angeles, he was injecting cocaine and probably committingburglaries to support himself. He let his teeth rot away, eating only childishsugary foods. He refused to wash. He listened to loud Heavy Metal music.It has been argued that it was his taste in music that drove him to murder andSatanism, but this would seem to be more part of the mood of censorship sweepingAmerica than a genuine explanation. Anyone who takes the trouble to listen tothe music in question, particularly the AC/DC album cited by American newspapersat the time of the murders, will find that there is little in it to inciteviolence.Ramirez’s obvious attempts to repel others in his personal behaviour, and hisheavy drug use seem more likely sources of violence than early poverty or music.His assumed “otherness” seems in retrospect sadly underdeveloped, having neverprogressed beyond a teenager’s need to appal staid grown-up society.This is not to say that Ramirez was unintelligent. His delaying of his trial andhis choice of the Hemandezes to continue the delays, shows that he had workedout the most effective method of staying alive for the longest period eitherbefore, or soon after he was captured. His remarks in court upon being sentencedwere not particularly original, yet they are articulate:“It’s nothing you’d understand but I do have something to say . . . I don’tbelieve in the hypocritical, moralistic dogma of this so-called civilizedsociety. I need not look beyond this room to see all the liars, haters, thekillers, the crooks, the paranoid cowards – truly trematodes of the Earth, eachone in his own legal profession. You maggots make me sick – hypocrites one andall . . . I am beyond your experience. I am beyond good and evil, legions of thenight, night breed, repeat not the errors of the Night Prowler [a name from anAC/DC song] and show no mercy. I will be avenged. Lucifer dwells within us all.That’s it.”The Night Stalker may not seem a “messiah” in any sense of the word, but itshould be noted that Satanism is a religion – some anthropologists have evendefined it as a sub-cult of Judo-Christianity, as its creeds are based onbiblical sources. Richard Ramirez clearly felt that he was making a stand forhis religion when he was on trial, and his statements won him followers . . . ofa sort.Since his conviction he has received fan mail from dozens of women, manyenclosing sexual photographs of themselves. Most of these “followers” areprobably just looking for a cheap thrill, like children who lean over the edgeof a bear pit at a zoo – he’s caged, so they can play at titillating him. None,however, should have any illusions about what he would have done to them if ithad been their house he broke into during his 1985 rampage.Yet Ramirez gained at least one devoted and genuine friend – his wife. InOctober 1996 he married Doreen Lioy – a forty-one-year-old freelance magazineeditor with a reported IQ of 152 – in a non-religious ceremony in the SanQuentin prison.Afterwards Doreen said: “The facts of his case ultimately will confirm thatRichard is a wrongly convicted man, and I believe fervently that his innocencewill be proven to the world.”***In 1982, Manson was moved from a maximum security jail to Vacaville Prison,fifty miles north-east of San Francisco. On the night of 29 October, a guardnoticed an open door in the prison chapel, where Manson worked as a cleaner.Manson and three other prisoners were found there. In the attic of the chapel, asearch revealed a tape recorder, tin cutters, a hacksaw, sandpaper, a tin ofinflammable liquid, nylon rope, and a catalogue for hot air balloons. There wasalso a quantity of marijuana. Manson, it seems, had been planning an escape bidin which the hot air balloon would carry them over the prison wall, and had hadthe catalogue sent to him quite openly.***The Matamoros MurdersIt might seem impossible to imagine a cult leader more dangerous and inhumanthan Charles Manson. But the details of the Matamoros murders – which began toemerge in mid-1989 – made it dear that Adolfo Constanzo was a serious contenderfor the title of America’s most sadistic serial killer.Unlike most practitioners of black magic, Adolfo Constanzo was not just aneccentric who made up his ceremonies as he went along. According to hisfollowers, he often boasted that he had been schooled in the dark religion ofPalo Mayombe from his earliest childhood. Brought up by his expatriate Cubanmother in Miami, Florida, he claimed that she was a fully trained priestess inthe blood cult, and that his earliest memory was of the sacrifice of a chicken.Palo Mayombe is the dark sister of the Santeria religion. Both originated on thewest coast of Africa and were brought over by slaves sent to the Spanishplantations of Cuba. The Spaniards had insisted, on pain of death, that allslaves convert to Christianity. They were gratified when their captives appearedto do so without fuss; in fact the slaves had retained all the essentials oftheir old religion by associating their gods with the icons of Catholic saints.(The Spanish overlords did not mind their slaves making blood sacrifices to theholy images – they attributed it to simple, Old Testament primitivism.)Santeria (meaning literally “the saints’ path”) has survived as a mixture ofChristianity and the old, voodoo-like African religion. Its “spells” can be usedfor good as well as harmful purposes and in basic attitude it most resembles theEuropean tradition of “white magic”.Palo Mayombe, which originated in the Congo area, is less benevolent. Thereligion centres around the nganga; a caldron filled with blood, a decomposinggoat’s head, a roasted turtle, sacred stirring sticks and, most importantly, ahuman skull – preferably belonging to a violent person who died a sudden death.The confused soul of the dead person is trapped in the nganga and will obey theorders of the Palo Mayombe priest if kept in a state of contentment with freshlyspilled blood. The “bound” spirit is said to be able to curse enemies, foretellthe future and provide both magical and physical protection (even from bullets).The purpose of a Palo Mayombe priest is to gain ultimate power in life since heor she believes that tales of an afterlife are lies. Dead spirits, they say,simply wander the material plane as if in limbo. At initiation, the new priestdeclares his soul to be dead and dedicates himself to the Congoese god ofdestruction, Kadiempembe “the Eater of Souls”. Thus, without an eternal spirit,he has nothing to lose and may do as he will with savage freedom. Non-believers,especially Christians, are considered “animals” who should be exploitedmercilessly.The skull for the nganga is traditionally obtained by graverobbing, but AdolfoConstanzo told his followers that his “Padrino”, or Godfather – the name givento high priests of the cult – had “hunted” living donors in his youth on Haiti.Constanzo intended to follow in his footsteps.A dark handsome youth with piercing eyes, Constanzo always made a powerfulimpression. When he moved to Mexico City in 1982, at the age of twenty-one, hequickly saw that, in the corrupt, superstitious atmosphere of the capital’sunderworld, a “padrino” could become a wealthy man . . .He set up as a fortune teller and soon built a reputation for uncanny accuracy.Many of the city’s drug barons relied on his forecasts to decide when to sendshipments across the American border. Subsequent investigation has revealed thatmuch of his “divined” information came from corrupt officials in the Mexicandrug administration – at least two of whom were his disciples.He quickly built up a hard core of a dozen or so dedicated followers who wouldmeet in the secret room in his luxury apartment that contained the stinkingnganga, and enact blood sacrifices – killing chickens, goats, dogs and cats – toensure good luck and obtain protection from the police.Observing the huge amount of money being made by the relatively simple,uneducated drug lords, Constanzo decided to break into the protection racket. Hetold the head of one clan of drug dealers, Guillermo Calzada, that for a largefee he would be willing to be his in-house fortune teller – magically protectinghim and his drugs at all times. Calzada, having experienced the accuracy ofConstanzo’s forecasts, accepted eagerly.Not long afterwards, Constanzo visited him and explained that in view of thefact it was his magic that was really doing the work, he deserved half theprofits . . . Calzada refused, and Constanzo left in a rage. A few days laterthe padrino called Calzada and begged his forgiveness. As a reconciliation heoffered to place a specially powerful protection spell on Calzada and hisfamily. Calzada agreed and on 30 April 1987, he, his wife, his ageing mother,his partner Jose Rolon, his secretary, his maid and his bodyguard met withConstanzo in a deserted factory.All seven reappeared in the Rio Zumpango river, north of Mexico City, severaldays later. They had been horribly mutilated before they were killed. Theirfingers, toes, ears and, in the case of the men, genitals had been cut off. Thehearts were also missing from some of the bodies and, more significantly, theheads.Constanzo fed the butchered remains to his nganga, thus gaining power over theanguished spirits of the owners, who would use ghostly toes to travel, fingersto manipulate, ears to hear, and hearts and genitals to accumulate power. Thesedamned souls were to be his servants as he expanded his operations to theMexico–Texas border and the town of Matamoros.Mexico City, Constanzo had decided, was too far from the most lucrative marketfor drugs; the United States. Matamoros, a tourist town on the Mexican side ofthe Rio Grande, would be an ideal base for his own drugs empire. He told one ofhis most ardent followers, Federal Narcotics agent Salvador Garcia, to apply fora transfer to the border town and assess the situation. Some weeks later Garciareported that the Hernandez family, well known locally to be drug smugglers,were having problems since the death of their leader in a gang shoot-out. Hisbrothers were unable to run the business efficiently and were badly in need ofmagical assistance. Constanzo made suitable blood sacrifices for luck andtravelled to Matamoros.His method of contacting the Hernandez brothers illustrates his subtlety. Hearranged a “chance” meeting with Sara Aldrete, an attractive honours student atthe Brownsville College, just across the border. Sara had once dated ElioHernandez, the boss of the family since the death of his brother, but had notseen him for years. Constanzo, after impressing her with his prophetic powersand luring her into bed, told her an old friend would soon contact her and tellher he was in trouble; she was to tell him that she had met a powerful magus,who might be the answer to all his problems . . .Sure enough, Sara bumped into Elio Hernandez in the street shortly afterwardsand when he had related his woes she persuaded him to meet with Constanzo. Thepadrino hooked Elio with his usual skill, and soon most of the drug dealers inthe family gang were attending Constanzo’s blood sacrifices (Sara Aldrete wasmade a high priestess and was, in theory, the controller of the Matamoros branchof the cult when Constanzo was in Mexico City).As promised, the Hernandez family business was soon flourishing under theprophetic guidance of Padrino Adolfo; the delivery runs went smoothly and themoney flowed in. Then in the spring of 1988, Constanzo told them that he had abetter idea than buying drugs – stealing them from small-time drug runners.Using information from one of the cult members, he located a large marijuanastash, and the family helped themselves. The original owner, and the farmer onwhose land it had been hidden, were taken to an orchard and shot in cold blood.It was the family’s first experience of Constanzo’s ruthlessness and they wereshocked; nevertheless, they swallowed their revulsion. Now they were implicatedin murder, they could be introduced into the darker secrets of Palo Mayombe.They were soon convinced that every time they made an important drugs run orneeded to avert misfortune they should make a ritual human sacrifice.Between May 1988 and March 1989, Constanzo and his followers tortured andmurdered at least thirteen people at the deserted Hernandez ranch outsideMatamoros. Most of the victims were rival drugs dealers or, occasionally, lapsedmembers of the cult. But some victims were strangers who were kidnapped whilewalking along the local highway, and murdered without being asked their names.Elio Hernandez was horrified to discover one day that the fourteen-year-old boyhe had just decapitated without looking at his face was, in fact, his secondcousin.All the cult’s known victims at Matamoros were male – Constanzo was bisexualwith a distinct homosexual bias. The treatment meted out to them before theywere allowed to die would have horrified an Aztec priest. The terrified victimwould be beaten and kicked and then dragged into a shed that contained thesacred nganga. Often his extremities (such as fingers, genitals, nose and ears)would be cut off and Constanzo would partially flay him. Then the others wouldbe asked to leave while the padrino sodomized him. Finally, the victim would be“sacrificed” by either cutting out his heart or lopping off the top of his head– Constanzo would often leave the death blow to one of the others to increasetheir complicity. The victims’ severed parts, brains, heart and blood would beplaced in the nganga. Their corpses were buried in shallow graves nearby.It was regarded as essential that the victim should scream as he died – thesoul, Constanzo believed, must be confused and terrified when it left the body,to make it easier to subjugate. Oddly enough it was this obsession that was tobring about his downfall.In March 1989, his henchmen kidnapped a street cocaine dealer that none of themrecognized – he has never been identified – and Constanzo went to work on him.But despite all his efforts he could not make the tough little Mexican cry out,even when he skinned his upper torso. The victim died without screaming.Constanzo was unnerved and declared the ceremony a failure. What they needed hedecided was an American; someone soft, “someone who will scream”.The next victim was easy to find. At the beginning of March, Matamoros isgenerally packed with American “spring breakers” – mostly students from Texasattracted by cheap alcohol, pot and cocaine. The cultists simply waited untilaround two in the morning, found a drunk student heading back across the border,and offered him a lift. His name was Mark Kilroy, a twenty-one-year-oldfirst-year medical student from the University of Texas. Constanzo did a verythorough job on the youth and was deeply satisfied with the result. He slicedthe top from the screaming American’s head with a machete and dropped his brainsinto the nganga.Now, he told his excited followers, they were unstoppable. Previously they hadonly had Mexican spirits to protect them on the south side of the border; nowthey had an American ghost to keep them safe from the Texas police. They werenow, he said, effectively invisible.But Constanzo’s sadism had overreached itself this time. The disappearance of anAmerican student in Matamoros might normally have failed to attract muchattention. But Mark Kilroy was the nephew of an important US Customs Adviser andthe authorities on both sides of the border were soon involved in a large-scalesearch.A few days after the sacrifice of Mark Kilroy, Serafin Hernandez Jnr, Elio’snephew, casually drove his pick-up truck past a queue of traffic and a policeroad check as if they could not see him. A patrol car quietly followed thisapparent madman all the way to the Hernandez ranch. They waited until he hadleft again and searched the place. They found evidence of the storage of drugsand had him arrested.After a little heavy persuasion (involving the squirting of soda water spikedwith tabasco up his nostrils – an agonizing but undetectable torture) heunexpectedly confessed to more shocking crimes than drug dealing. His casualconfession – he still believed that the police could not defeat his padrino’smagic – led them back to the ranch to the shallow graves and the nganga shed.The police quickly moved to arrest all the members of the cult named inSerafin’s confession, but were too late to catch the padrino and his closestassociates; Constanzo and his inner circle had already fled to Mexico City. Thediscoveries at the ranch worried many influential people. Constanzo had been afashionable fortune teller, and many of his clients were from Mexican highsociety. Some of these were worried simply about their reputations. Others,especially in law enforcement, were terrified that Constanzo’s confession mightreveal their involvement in drug trafficking. They could only pray that he wouldnot be taken alive.After a brief stop in the capital, Constanzo and his followers fled to theresort of Cuernavaca, fifty miles south of Mexico City. They were not, in fact,too concerned about the problem; they had a large amount of money on them andwere convinced that when things cooled down they could buy their way across theborder. In fact, after three weeks, they even returned to Mexico City and hid inthe apartment of a friend.On the 5 May, a police informer reported that a woman fitting Sara AIdrete’sdescription had been seen buying a large quantity of food, and that he hadfollowed her to her apartment. The next day, Constanzo’s lookouts spotted carsof plain-clothes policemen moving in on the apartment block. Constanzo rushed tothe window and saw heavily armed policemen preparing to storm the building.Panic reigned among the cultists. Constanzo and a henchman named Valdez –nicknamed “El Dubi” – exchanged machine-gun fire with the police, while SaraAldrete and another lover of Constanzo’s, Omar Ochoa, hid under a bed. Then thehysterical padrino started to pile wads of money into the gas stove and burntthem.He and El Dubi continued to fire on the police until they were almost out ofammunition. Then, suddenly calm, Constanzo announced that they must all killthemselves. Taking his bodyguard/lover, Martin Rodriguez, into a walk-in closethe ordered El Dubi to shoot them. When the gunman just stared at him he slappedhim and said, “Do it or I’ll make things tough on you in Hell.” As El Dubiraised the weapon Constanzo said calmly, “Don’t worry, I’ll be back. Now do it.”At the order Valdez sprayed them with bullets. Both died instantly.The others were taken alive. Detailed confessions revealed that there had beenfifteen murders at Matamoros, and eight in Mexico City (the eighth victim in thecapital was a transvestite called Ramon Esquivel who had been tortured, murderedand his dissected body left on a public street corner). They added up to a totalof twenty-three “sacrifices” to the god Kadiempembe. Police later investigatedthe possibility that Constanzo’s gang was responsible for sixteen ritual murdersof children, all under the age of sixteen.The Matamoros police had the nganga and the shed that contained it exorcized bya curandero or white witch. Then they doused the shed with petrol and burned itto the ground.***The religions of Santeria and Palo Mayombe are so widespread in Miami’s Cubanpopulation, that the Miami River has been nicknamed “the River of Chickens” bythe sanitation crews that work on it.

For almost ten years, throughout the 1990s, most of the world slepteasier in their beds, freed from the threat of nuclear war. But during that timeof comparative peace a new threat grew up: that of religiously inspiredterrorism. But is the threat of the “mad mullahs” and the “religious whackos”something that should disturb our sleep?David Koresh and the Branch DavidiansEarly in the afternoon of 19 April 1993, the TV news began to broadcast picturesof the final assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, where DavidKoresh and his followers had been holding police and federal authorities at bayfor fifty-one days. Koresh, who claimed to be the Son of God, had been wantedfor questioning by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF)because he and his followers were known to be stockpiling weapons and explosives– the Branch Davidians believed that the war of Armageddon was imminent. Koreshhad made several offers to allow the ATF to inspect his weapons arsenal – all ofit, he insisted, legal and licensed – but they refused, preferring to make asurprise visit.On 28 February, heavily armed agents from the ATF attempted to gain access tothe Branch Davidian’s main building in the Waco compound. Someone started firingweapons. Four ATF officers and six Branch Davidians died in the battle.The ATF later claimed that the cultists fired first, and the Branch Davidiansinsisted that it was the ATF who opened fire. (In fact, Koresh later claimed hispeople never shot anyone – he said that the ATF, firing wildly, had accidentallyshot their own people.) Ironically, the Branch Davidians would have been withintheir rights to use their weapons, as the ATF agents did not have a valid searchwarrant and, under Texas law, a citizen is allowed to forcibly defend hisproperty from attempts at illegal breaking-and-entry. But such petty legalpoints did not stop the federal authorities descending on the Koresh compoundwith military force following the gun battle.Throughout March and early April, the surrounded cultists expressed defiance. Ona number of occasions, their leader agreed to surrender, then changed his mindat the last moment. To the worldwide audience that watched the siege daily ontelevision, it seemed obvious that David Koresh was enjoying making fools of theauthorities. Magazine articles about the thirty-three-year-old rock guitaristtalked about his harem of wives – which included under-age girls – and hordes ofchildren, while ex-disciples described his self-glorifying sermons, whichsometimes went on for as long as sixteen hours. The result was that most peoplewere impatient with the apparent “softly softly” tactics of the authorities, andlooked forward to the day when Koresh would be standing in court and sentencedto a long term of imprisonment.So, on that April morning, when the federal agents decided to break the siegewith tanks, there must have been few people in the worldwide audience who didnot look forward to the prospect of Koresh getting his come-uppance. It allbegan when an armoured vehicle rolled up to the main building in the compound,and a loudspeaker asked those inside to surrender. The answer was a barrage ofbullets that bounced off the armour. The vehicle rolled forward and tore thecorner off the building. Meanwhile, other tanks, with metal extension tubesattached to their barrels, knocked holes in the buildings, then pumped in cloudsof CS tear gas. Then the vehicles withdrew and waited.After six hours of stand-off, the first wisps of smoke began to drift up fromthe buildings. It looked as if something had started a fire, perhaps ignitingthe CS gas. In a few minutes, flames were bursting out of upstairs windows. TheTV cameras waited expectantly for the rush of fugitives from the quickly burningbuilding, but none were to be seen. No attempt was made by the FBI to stop thefire – none could, as no fire trucks had been called. In a few minutes, the woodand plasterboard buildings were a roaring inferno. At least eighty cult members,including twenty-seven children, died in the fire. Only nine people escaped fromthe burning buildings. Koresh was not among them.The federal authorities, in the subsequent inquiry, claimed that Koresh haddecided that he and his followers must die by fire, and had stopped most of thecultists escaping to safety. Many cult members were found lying face down, aposition typical of death by smoke inhalation; others had died of gunshotwounds. Like the Reverend Jim Jones in Guyana in 1978, Koresh, the FBI said, hadenforced a mass suicide.But why had so many apparently normal people decided to leave their homes – somefrom England and Australia – to follow this skinny, long-haired Texan who madethe pompous assertion that he was King David as well as the Son of God? As theevidence about Koresh began to emerge, the problem became more, and not less,puzzling. At first, it looked as if he was a straightforward conman. When he hadfirst joined the Branch Davidian sect as an odd job man, he lost no time inseducing its leader, sixty-eight-year-old prophetess Lois Roden, explaining thathe had received a revelation that he was to become the father of her child.Whether she believed him or not, she became his secret mistress, and was soonconvinced she was pregnant. From then on, Koresh manoeuvred until he took overthe cult.Revelations about Koresh’s later sexual behaviour reinforced the conman theme.Soon after the affair with Lois Roden, he announced that God had told him tomarry a fourteen-year-old girl named Rachel Jones, daughter of sect membersPerry and Mary Jones. Not long after he seduced another fourteen-year-old girl,Karen Doyle, daughter of another convert. When her father found out, he wasfurious. But Koresh explained that he had been equally shocked when God told himthat he had to “give his seed” to Karen. “I begged God not to make me do this.”Karen first learned about God’s command when she was asleep in a bus used as adormitory, and felt a tap on her shoulder. Koresh whispered to her that God hadordered him to give her his seed, and Karen whispered back “I will do whateverthe Lord wants.” So Koresh climbed into bed with her. At the time, the firstwife, Rachel, was on a visit to California.Twelve-year-old Michele Jones was his wife’s sister, and Koresh drove toCalifornia to bring her back to Texas. As he explained it, he was again anunwilling participant in the seduction. Halfway back to Texas he experienced apowerful urge to undress her and make love to her. He stopped the car, walked upthe road, and asked God: “God, what’s happening to me? I mean I wanted to fuckher – that’s all I could think about.” God helped him overcome his lust and hedrove her back to Texas. There, reading a passage in the Song of Solomon about agirl with no breasts, he realized that God was indicating that Michele was tobecome his wife. “So I go right to Michele and I climb into bed with her. Shethinks I’m trying to get warm. I reached for her underwear to take ’em off. Shedidn’t know what I was doing so she struggled . . . But I was too strong, and Iwas doing this for God, and I told her about the prophecies. That’s how shebecame my wife.” He explained to his male followers that they should not envyhim because “none of you men know the pain I endure to do God’s work”. Seedingall his women wore him out, he complained. “I get tired, I suffer.” Hissufferings would eventually father twenty-two children.A book called Preacher of Death by Martin King and Marc Breault, fills out thepicture. Breault was a leading disciple who later became disillusioned anddefected. When he met Koresh, Breault was studying to become a minister. In1986, Koresh’s father-in-law, Perry Jones, introduced himself to Breault as ajournalist specializing in religion. When he told Breault that he thought hisson-in-law had “inspiration from God”, Breault agreed to meet the prophet.Koresh turned up with his wife Rachel and baby son Cyrus. He seemed friendly andsympathetic, and Breault immediately liked him. In Breault’s apartment, Koreshlaunched into a three-hour Bible class. He had an amazing gift of fluency andconviction. His central point was that God always worked through prophets, andthat God had granted him special insight into the Book of Revelation. ToBreault, this sounded totally plausible; soon he was willing to follow Koreshanywhere.And why should a young man with a promising career in the ministry abandoneverything to follow such a madman? Reading Breault’s description of themeeting, it all becomes clear. Koresh presented himself as an open, friendly butintense young man (he was then twenty-seven) who differed from others only inthe depth of his biblical knowledge, and his conviction that God had had chosenhim as His instrument for a special revelation.Hitler’s deputy Albert Speer recorded that Hitler converted him to Nazism underparallel circumstances. Expecting a ranting maniac, he was surprised to findthat Hitler spoke gently and reasonably, and said many things about Germany thatSpeer perceived as true. Once intellectual assent has been given, the restfollowed naturally: all humans long for powerful conviction, for ideas that seemto offer them a new and more meaningful way of life. When Breault decided tofollow Koresh, he felt that it was the ideas he was following; the fact thattheir mouthpiece was an intense but unthreatening individual made it seemnatural and inevitable. Breault’s account makes it clear that Koresh was no mereTartuffe, ineptly faking a mask of piety. He was either an intellectual conmanof awesome plausibility or, perhaps, a true believer in his own prophethood.Once Breault had accepted Koresh as a prophet, it was not difficult to acceptthat he was – in some sense – the Son of God. And once he had gone this far, itbecame easier to accept the greatest stumbling block to regarding him as amessiah – his obsessive seduction of teenage cult members. Koresh explained thathe simply wanted them to receive his holy seed, to build up the futuregeneration who would inherit the earth. The whole process was so gradual thatthere was no point at which Breault felt that he was trying to swallow a camel.Breault’s disillusionment began when he witnessed the mistreatment of Cyrus,Koresh’s own three-year-old son. Koresh had ordered the child to acknowledgethat another cult member was his true mother; when Cyrus refused, Koresh beathim for twenty minutes on his bare bottom with a wooden paddle, then made himsleep in a garage that was (Koresh told the terrified boy) infested with rats.When the child still refused to deny his true mother, Koresh starved him for twodays until he was too weak to hold a glass of water. Koresh was clearly a personwho would not, under any circumstances, allow himself to be contradicted.Further disillusionment followed when Koresh delivered a sixteen-hour sermonwhose content was the declaration that all the women in the compound belonged tohim. (Endless sermons and harangues are one of the basic techniques ofbrainwashing.) Judy Schneider, the wife of chief disciple Steve Schneider, wasseduced while Steve was abroad on a recruiting drive, and was soon pregnant.Steve was at first shattered, and even thought of murdering the prophet; but thethought of what might happen to his wife if he failed finally deterred him. Theseduction of Judy served a double purpose; it subdued Steve, who had always feltambivalent about the prophet, and it persuaded all the other married women inthe compound that they ought to follow suit.It was when Koresh started making advances to another recent convert, with whomMarc Breault was in love, that Breault decided it was time to leave. It happenedin California: Breault openly contradicted “King David” who, infuriated, orderedhim to humble himself and lick the dust. Breault refused and was ordered toreturn to Texas. Instead, he flew back to Australia, and there set aboutde-converting other Branch Davidians.When Koresh heard the news, he rushed to Australia, where there was aconfrontation. Koresh won hands down, with a performance that included gazing atthe heavens and declaring that he was being crucified all over again. Breaultbeat a tactical retreat. But soon after his exit, the police arrived – Breaulthad asked his brother to call them if he was not home by ten – and Koresh lefthastily by the back door and caught the next plane back to America.It was largely due to Breault’s efforts that the Federal Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms finally decided to take action about the enormous cache ofweapons and explosives that Koresh was known to have stored at the compound, andthe siege of the Branch Davidians began. When it ended on 19 April, police foundover a million rounds of ammunition still unspent in the underground arsenal ofthe compound.It is not known exactly how many people were killed in the Waco siege.Seventy-two bodies were recovered from the ashes, and the official count waseighty-six (including the six killed in the ATF raid) but this was almostcertainly not the full count. All Koresh’s twenty or so ‘wives’ and fourteen ofhis twenty-two children died in the fire – four of them shot through the head.Two weeks after the siege, Koresh himself was identified through dental records;he had died of a gunshot wound in the head, apparently self-inflicted.Confronted with a case like this, we are inclined to ask the obvious question:was Koresh simply a confidence man, or did he – to some extent – believe what hesaid?The answer is: both. And when we understand how that is possible, we haveachieved one of the basic keys to the whole messiah phenomenon.The first thing we need to know about Vernon Wayne Howell – who became DavidKoresh – is that he spent the first part of his life looking for security. Bornillegitimate (in 1959) to a fourteen-year-old girl, brought up by a harshstepfather, educationally disadvantaged (he was dyslexic), bullied because hewas small – he was once even raped by older boys – he was a shy and notparticularly outstanding child. His refuge from his problems lay in religion –his school was affiliated to the Seventh Day Adventists – and he read the Biblein the way other children read comic books: to escape reality. By the age oftwelve he had learned the New Testament by heart. Then his life suddenlychanged. His teacher entered him for a race on the school sports day. Vernon hadnever thought of himself as the sporting type, and had avoided physicalcompetition. But he had spent a great deal of time racing against his brother onthe farm, and could take off like a whippet. He won the race – and severalothers – and the congratulations were an intoxicant. Suddenly he was asked tojoin teams; he became the school sports hero. Determined to maintain his newstatus, he went in for bodybuilding, taking an enormous pride in his physicalstrength. By the time he was thirteen, the shy, quiet boy had become a“sport-jock” and a leader.Even as a teenager, Vernon’s natural charm and dominance made him popular withthe opposite sex, and he lost interest in religion. Then, at nineteen, he had anaffair with a sixteen-year-old girl, who bore his child. He wanted to marry her;she felt he was unfit to raise a child, and left him. The blow to his ego waspainful, and in the emotional turmoil, he turned for solace to the religion ofhis childhood, and became a born-again Christian in the Southern Baptist Church.But now he was religious again, the strength of his sexual impulse began toworry him; he turned to his pastor, explaining that he was a compulsivemasturbator. The pastor told him that if he prayed to Jesus, he would be givenstrength. When this failed to happen, he decided that the Southern BaptistChurch lacked a true link with God, and returned to the Seventh Day Adventists.He fell in love with the daughter of his new pastor, and while he was prayingfor guidance, seemed to hear God’s voice telling him that she would be given tohim. When he opened his eyes he saw his Bible open at Isaiah 34, which declaredthat none should want for a mate. Convinced that this was a sign, he went to thepastor to tell him that God had given him his daughter for a wife. The pastorthrew him out, and when he persisted, he was expelled from the congregation.(The girl herself seems to have agreed with her father.)This conflict between his natural dominance and his inability to get his own waybecame a torment, undermining his self-belief. He wandered from place to place,doing odd jobs – he had been trained as a mechanic. And one day he found his wayto Mount Carmel, near Waco, in Texas, and joined the Branch Davidian sect as anodd job man; for a long time he was the dishwasher. He later described himselfas “the camp bum, the loser that did all the dirty jobs”. Yet he was alsodisliked by most of the other sect members, due to his arrogance and egotism.By comparison, Lois Roden, the head of the sect, was everything he had dreamedabout. Still attractive at sixty-eight, she was a famous TV evangelist, a friendof the rich and famous, who spent much of her time travelling around the world.She was also a favourite of the feminist movement, since she had announced thatGod was female, and began the Lord’s Prayer “Our Mother, who art in heaven”.For a long time, she shared the general view of Vernon, and made him live in asmall, unfurnished room to try to cure his conceit. Her view began to changewhen, two years after his arrival, he told her that the Lord (or Lady?) hadrevealed to him that he had been chosen to father her child, who would be theChosen One. When her son George – who expected to replace his mother aspresident – found out about the affair, he did his best to eject the interloper.His mother, convinced she was pregnant, defended Howell. The power struggleended abruptly when Howell announced that God had ordered him to marry afourteen-year-old named Rachel Jones – which he duly did, alienating Lois Roden(who did not give birth after all). For a while, George was placated. Then hisfury erupted again, and he opened fire with an Uzi sub-machine gun. Fortunately,his aim was bad; but Vernon and his few faithful followers decided to leaveMount Carmel.For the next two years, Vernon Howell and his small group of followers (abouttwenty-five) lived in the “wilderness” – that is, they set up camp at a placecalled Palestine, and lived rough. But while his followers coped with lack ofrunning water and sanitation, Vernon was often off on “recruiting drives” – inCalifornia, in Israel, even in Australia. He was hurled bodily out of a SeventhDay Adventist church in San Diego when he interrupted the service to announcethat he was the Messiah. But although many potential converts began by regardinghim as a madman, some of them ended by being swayed by his burning conviction,or by his insistence that they would be damned unless they followed him. Thesettlement at Palestine grew; so did the number of his under-age mistresses.When disciples had a teenage daughter, she usually became Vernon’s “wife”.Back in Waco, George Roden – whose mother was now dead – was showing signs ofthe paranoia that tends to afflict religious fanatics. He announced that he wasGod, and ended prayers with “In the name of George B. Roden, amen”. And althoughVernon and his followers were ninety miles away, in Palestine, Roden broodedconstantly on unmasking “the impostor”.In 1987, he devised a bizarre challenge. An eighty-five-year-old woman namedAnna Hughes had died at Mount Carmel. George dug up the body, installed it inthe chapel, and challenged Vernon to a contest: whichever could raise AnnaHughes from the dead was the true prophet of God. George had the satisfaction ofseeing Vernon decline the challenge and slink away. But when Howell told hislawyer what had happened, the lawyer was delighted; George Roden had laidhimself open to the charge of abusing a corpse. Vernon hastened to tell thepolice what had happened.They were cautious, realizing that getting mixed up with the in-fighting ofreligious cranks could be a challenging experience. They explained that theywould need a photograph of the corpse. Vernon agreed to supply one. But sincethat meant that he would have to enter Mount Carmel by stealth, he decided thathe might as well make the best of the opportunity, and try to evict George. Heand his followers bought weapons. On 3 November 1987, he and a team of disciple“Mighty Man Commandos” wriggled through the undergrowth at Mount Carmel towardsthe chapel, rifles slung on their backs. A dog spotted them and barked; GeorgeRoden rushed out with his Uzi and began to blaze away. Vernon and his eightcommandos blazed back, none of them succeeding in hitting anything. The sound offiring brought the local police, and everyone was arrested – except one MightyMan who managed to escape.Vernon and one of the Mighty Men – who happened to be a millionaire – werereleased after paying $100,000 bail. To George Roden’s fury, Vernon seized theopportunity to tell his version of the incident on the local television news.Roden now made his fatal mistake; he wrote letters to the Texas Supreme Courtthreatening to strike everybody down with Aids and herpes unless they sentencedVernon to life imprisonment. Instead, George was sentenced to six months forcontempt of court. And when he appeared in court as a witness against Vernon andhis Mighty Men, and explained how he intended to raise Anna Hughes from thedead, the jury lost no time in acquitting Vernon and his commandos.Fifteen months later, George Roden ceased to be a problem when he was sentencedto life imprisonment for murder. The story of how this came about is aninteresting demonstration of the contagious nature of messianism. One day in thesummer of 1988, an ex-alcoholic named Dale Adair came to see Vernon Howell andMarc Breault, declaring that he wanted to get back to God. Vernon harangued himfor three days, trying to convince him that he, Vernon, was the Messiah.Suddenly Adair’s eyes glazed over, and he stared towards heaven. “My God, myGod. After all these years I understand. I’m the Messiah. I’m the David. Now Iknow why I’ve suffered all these years.” “Dale lost his sanity right before oureyes,” said Breault. It doesn’t seem to have occurred to anyone that Adair mightnot be the only one with delusions of divinity.Against Howell’s advice, Adair hurried to George Roden to tell him that he wasthe Messiah, but Roden took the news badly, seizing an axe and splitting openAdair’s skull. Roden was convicted of murder, and since he owed thousands ofdollars in taxes, Mount Carmel was put up for sale. Vernon’s followers raisedthe money, and later that year, Vernon Howell – now calling himself David Koresh(Koresh being a Hebrew transliteration of Cyrus, the name of the Persian kingwho allowed the Jews held captive in Babylon to return to Israel) – at lastbecame owner of the Waco compound. From the time he had arrived there as LoisRoden’s lowest disciple, it had taken him eight years to gain total control ofthe sect.Koresh spent the next four years ruling Mount Carmel like a king. He took hispick of the women and rarely worked, other than his multi-hour sermons/haranguesand occasional trips abroad to find new converts. But he made his disciples workfrom dawn to dusk at menial and even pointless tasks. One was even heard tomutter: “Lord, I wish the Messiah wasn’t such a prick!” Yet this generaldissatisfaction never led to any significant revolt, until Breault’s flight.When he realised Breault had left, Koresh called an emergency meeting andlaunched a manhunt. But it was too late. Breault was determined to bring aboutthe downfall of his former “master”. He wrote letters to the police, to stateauthorities, to members of Congress. His greatest coup was to organize the visitof an Australian television team to Waco. Unaware that Breault was behind it,Koresh allowed the team into the compound because he hoped for favourablecoverage; but the programme – when it went out in April 1992 – left no one inany doubt that Koresh was a child molester with a dangerous god-complex.In May 1992, the Waco Tribune Herald began an investigation into the BranchDavidian sect. One result of their revelations was the decision by the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to launch an investigation into the sect . . .Now, over a decade since the ashes of the siege have settled, pointed questionsremain – and not about the cult’s part in the tragedy. For example, the questionas to who fired first during the original, botched ATF raid might have beensettled by the compound’s metal front door. The ATF claimed the cultists openedfire through the door at them. Koresh, in telephone negotiations during thesiege, said the ATF had first fired through it when he refused to come out. Hepointed out that the bullet holes were all from the outside, coming inward. Thisevidence could not be checked after the fire, however, as the door mysteriouslydisappeared from the crime scene.More damningly, some now believe that the federal authorities deliberatelymurdered the Branch Davidians. They point out that the CS tear gas fired intothe building by the FBI tanks was not only potentially lethal, it was alsohighly flammable. The makers of CS gas specifically insist that it should neverbe used in confined spaces. Unable to disperse in open air, it can cause fatalpoisoning (it contains cyanide). Then, when it settles a short time after beingreleased, CS gas forms a fine dust that burns very easily and rapidly. When thefire started, every surface and person within the compound would have had adusting of this powder.The nine surviving cultists have always maintained that there was no “suicidepact” among the Branch Davidians, and some even claimed that FBI snipers shot atthem as they escaped, preventing the others from leaving the building. Indeed,infrared aerial footage, taken by the FBI during the fire, reveals weaponflashes going off outside the flaming compound. On the other hand, the survivorssuggest, the only shooting done by the trapped cultists was to save each otherand their children from being burned to death.In August 1999, the FBI was forced to admit that ‘pyrotechnic tear gascanisters’ were fired into the Waco compound after the tanks had deployed the CSgas, but before the fire was seen to start. They flatly denied that these wereresponsible for starting the blaze, but the incendiaries certainly could haveignited the wooden, sun-dried, CS-powder-coated buildings. At the very least,the use of such weapons under such circumstances was highly questionable.But why would the United States government ruthlessly murder over eighty adultsand children? The cultists claimed, during the siege and after, that gunmen infederal helicopters had fired blindly through the roof of the building – iftrue, this was a blatant act of child endangerment (of the very children the FBIclaimed to be so desperate to save). Perhaps it was thought that the only way tototally destroy the evidence of such a crime would be to burn the building – andits occupants. The ATF also bulldozed what little was left of the compoundbefore it could be properly examined. The head of the subsequent Senateinvestigation of the Waco siege, while exonerating the FBI, noted that gettingthe authorities to hand over evidence “was as difficult as pulling teeth”.Secondly, it has been claimed that the US government wanted to frighten thevarious groups, like the Branch Davidians, who espoused anti-federalistdoctrines (Koresh said the federal government was under the control of theAntichrist). These anti-federal religious sects, “militias” and “patriot groups”had been rapidly growing up across the US since the mid-1980s, and were nolonger composed of just a few extremists and crazies. Hundreds of thousands ofordinary, middle-class Americans, tired of big government and big businessruling their lives, had joined or indirectly supported groups who were callingfor an end to federal income tax and the dismantling of the monolithic federalgovernment machine.Those that believe the federal authorities were sending an intimidating messageto these anti-federal groups – by slaughtering the Branch Davidians – point tothe official title of the attack that ended the Waco siege: it was called“Operation Showtime”.Shoko Asahara and the Aum ShinrikyoOn 20 March 1995, soon after 7 a.m., commuters on the Tokyo subway began toexperience a tickling in the throat and a soreness in the eyes and nose; soonthey smelled a stench like a mixture of mustard and burning rubber. Withinminutes, dozens of people were choking or falling to the ground.It was happening all over the Tokyo underground system. No one had any idea whatwas causing it. Fleets of ambulances ferried gasping or unconscious passengersto hospitals – the figure finally reached 5,500. Many seemed to be paralysed,and a dozen would finally die. Yet it was not until mid-morning that a militarydoctor made a cautious and incredible diagnosis: the victims were suffering frompoisoning by a nerve gas called sarin, once used by the Nazis in their deathcamps.This was not the first such terrorist attack. On 27 June 1994, in the city ofMatsumoto, in the Nagano Prefecture, a similar sarin attack flooded the localhospital. Fortunately the gas had been released into the open air, so lesspeople were affected, but seven died nonetheless. The bemused authoritiesdecided it was a matter for the local police only – a decisive factor inallowing the Tokyo attack to take place.After Tokyo, a national police investigation soon turned up a likely suspect: animmensely wealthy religious cult known as Aum Shinrikyo, or Aum Supreme Truth,led by a forty-year-old guru who called himself Shoko Asahara.During the past six months police had received dozens of phone calls accusingthe cult of fraud, abduction, and brutality. Things had come to a head a monthearlier, when a sixty-eight-year-old lawyer named Kiyoshi Kariya had beenkidnapped in broad daylight, grabbed by four powerfully built men, and bundledinto the back of a van. Kariya’s sister had been a cult member who hadabsconded, and Kariya had received a threatening phone call, demanding to knowwhere she was. After Kariya’s disappearance, his son found a note that read: “IfI disappear, I was abducted by Aum Shinrikyo.” A police investigation began, butfailed to find either Kariya or his body.Now Aum Shinrikyo was the chief suspect in the gas attack. In spite of hisprotest (“We carry out our religious activities on the basis of Buddhistdoctrines, such as no killing”) police raided Asahara’s headquarters on theslopes of Mount Fuji. Most of the cultists had left, taking crates of documents;but the police found a huge stockpile of chemicals like sodium cyanide andpeptone for cultivating bacteria. But the cult insisted, through its spokesmen,that this was all for legitimate peaceful purposes.On 23 April, the cult’s chief scientist, Hideo Murai, was murdered in front of acrowd of reporters and TV cameramen, stabbed repeatedly in the stomach by asmall-time crook named Hiroyuki Jo, who then demanded, “Isn’t anyone going toarrest me?” Police quickly obliged.But where was the guru? He had vanished without a trace. On 5 May, two monthsafter the sarin attack, a bag left in the toilet of the Shinjuku train stationburst into flame. Alert staff doused it with water, but not before it had begunto emit choking fumes. Police discovered later that, if left undiscovered, itwould have given off clouds of hydrogen cyanide gas, called Zyklon B by theNazis, which would have been sucked through the ventilators onto the platform.One of the chief suspects was a young cultist called Yoshihiro Inoue, the guru’sintelligence chief. He was caught driving a car that contained chemicals formanufacturing high explosives. This left no one in any doubt that the cult’sprotestations about love and peace were false. On 16 May, there was another hugepolice raid on the Mount Fuji headquarters; this time they found a secret room,inside which a large, bearded figure sat cross-legged on the floor in themeditation posture. He admitted: “I am the guru. Don’t touch me, I don’t evenallow my disciples to touch me.”Asahara, whose real name was Chizuo Matsumoto, had been born blind in one eyeand partially blind in the other. He was raised in a poor home, but had been abrilliant pupil at school. He thought of becoming a radical politician, like MaoTse Tung, then began to meditate and claimed that one day he felt the kundalini(the sacred energy that electrifies and enlightens the soul) mounting his spine.The 1980s in Japan were rather like the 1960s in Britain and America, a periodthat Asahara’s biographers have called “the rush hour of the gods”.Asahara founded a yoga school, which became so profitable that he opened severalmore. Then he went off to the Himalayas to meditate and had himself photographedwith the Dalai Lama, who told him he had the mind of a Buddha. (After Asahara’sarrest, the Dalai Lama was deeply embarrassed by this gaffe.) There in theHimalayas, Asahara claims he experienced enlightenment and achieved psychicpowers.Back in Tokyo he changed the name of his yoga school to Aum Supreme Truth (Om orAum is a Sanskrit syllable pronounced during meditation). Teaching a mixture ofBuddhism, Christianity and Hinduism (with the predictions of Nostradamus thrownin for good measure) Asahara, who claimed to be the embodiment of the god Shiva,was soon surrounded by hundreds of followers. Since he assured them that largecash donations would hasten their spiritual enlightenment, he was soon a wealthyman. Brilliant young students from the universities began to join the sect; oneof them, Hideo Murai, invented a kind of electric cap which, when placed on thehead, supposedly raised the user’s level of consciousness.But desertion roused Asahara to a kind of frenzy. One disciple who announced hewas leaving the sect was told he was in need of physical as well aspsychological help, and ordered to drink large quantities of freezing water.After a few pints, he went into shock and died. Another disenchanted disciple,Shuji Taguchi, was strangled; his body burned. Another was attacked when he hadreturned home to his family; his skull was smashed with a hammer. The cultmembers also murdered his wife and child.The sect had a strict celibacy law, but as so often happens with rogue messiahs,the guru couldn’t resist the temptations of the flesh himself. Asahara regularlyenjoyed sex with selected female disciples, who were then sworn to secrecy.During the 1990s, Aum Supreme Truth began to spread all over the world. Therehad probably not been such a successful cult since Ron Hubbard’s Scientology.The post-Communist Russians were particularly sympathetic to it, and Aum SupremeTruth continued to be a powerful movement in Russia – but under the new name ofAleph.World success made Asahara think in terms of world power. In 1993, his chiefengineer, Kiyohide Hayakawa, was instructed to try and buy an atomic bomb. (Infact, during 1994, Hayakawa made eight trips to Russia trying to buy a nuclearwarhead.) When he failed, the cult tried to buy a rural area near Tokyo, wherethere were deposits of uranium. And when this also failed they decided to buyland in Australia. It was half a million acres of scrubland called BanjawarnStation, which the cult bought for $400,000, in cash, after which it paid afurther $110,000 for mining rights. There they began testing nerve gas on sheepwhose skeletons were later found by police.However, rumours that the cult tested the world’s first non-governmental atomicbomb in the Australian outback are probably false. A large detonation took placenear Banjawarn Station while the cult were camped there – registered byseismologists hundreds of miles away – but this is now thought to have beencaused by the atmospheric explosion of a large meteor or a small comet.As the cult’s success increased, so did its paranoia. This mindset seems to haveescalated sharply after the interest the police took in the disappearance ofKiyoshi Kariya, and this “persecution” in turn seems to have triggered thedecision to launch the sarin attacks. It certainly made no sense. What possiblepoint could there be to gassing hundreds of people in the Tokyo subway system?Asahara’s trial failed to enlighten the public. Placed on the stand in 1996, herefused to enter a plea of either guilty or not guilty. For almost nine years,as the trial ground along, the ex-guru flatly refused to answer questions withanything but incomprehensible mutterings. In February 2004, he was sentenced todeath on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. Twelve of his followersare also on death row for related crimes. All appealed their death sentences,safe in the knowledge that, given the slowness of the Japanese justice system,they might avoid execution for many years, even if their appeals were ultimatelyunsuccessful.So, why did they do it? The followers, predictably, say that they were acting onthe guru’s orders, and were not privy to his divine plan. Asahara, through hislawyer, claims the followers cooked up the whole scheme themselves, without hisknowledge. He says that he doesn’t know why they tried to murder so many people.Osama bin Laden and al-QaedaOn the morning of 11 September 2001, two hijacked Boeing 757 passenger jets weredeliberately crashed into the Twin Towers of the New York World Trade Centre;the first struck the North Tower at 8.45 a.m., the second hit the South Tower at9.06 a.m. Both of the 110-storey (1,350-foot) skyscrapers collapsed within anhour and a half of the first impact.The death toll caused by the destruction of Twin Towers has been estimated as2,752 people. (This figure remains debatable, as officials have refused toinclude dozens of missing homeless people and illegal immigrants who are thought– but cannot be proved – to have been in the disaster area.)At 9.40 a.m., a third hijacked Boeing 757 struck the west side of the Pentagonbuilding in Washington DC – the nerve centre of the US Military; 189 people werekilled.At 10.37 a.m., the fourth and last hijacked plane crashed in open countrysidenear Shanksville Pennsylvania, killing all forty-four on board. A mobile phonemessage from a passenger just before the crash said that he and some others weregoing to try to recapture the plane from terrorists. It has been speculatedthat, if the hijackers had not crashed the Shanksville plane prematurely, theywould have tried to collide the jet into Camp David – the presidential ruralretreat in Maryland. American President George W. Bush Junior was not inresidence at the time, but Camp David was where the historic peace accordbetween Egypt’s President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Beginwas signed in 1978: a hated symbol of Arab–Israeli cooperation to many Moslemfundamentalists.The death toll for what has come to be known simply as “9/11” (i.e. – 11September 2001) – including the nineteen suicide hijackers – is 2,985 people.It is known that the hijackers were Islamic fundamentalists – and were mostlySaudi Arabians. The al-Qaeda terrorist network, headed by Osama bin Laden, isstrongly suspected of being behind the 11 September hijackings. Much has beenwritten and said about Osama bin Laden – much of it understandably vitriolicscreeds that have raised the man to a similar level of infamy as Adolf Hitlerand Joseph Stalin – but is he, as he is so often described, a man dedicated to“evildoing”?The tabloid view of Osama bin Laden is that of a foam-mouthed, rabid-eyedIslamic fanatic, driven by a hatred of Western decency. To quote US PresidentGeorge W. Bush from a speech to Congress in September 2001: “They [bin Laden andal-Queda] hate our freedoms: our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, ourfreedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.”On the other hand, Western journalists who have actually met bin Laden havedescribed him as mild-mannered, hospitable and even rather introverted. Hishatred of the West and anything that does not fall under his cruelinterpretation of Islamic law cannot be denied, but neither has he been legallyproved to have been directly involved with the 9/11 atrocity.The main evidence presented to date – a very rough video recording in which binLaden apparently confesses to being told about the attacks five days before theyhappened – is now widely suspected to be a fake. But even if the tape is realand the statement is true, bin Laden’s “confession” actually exonerates him ofthe charge of planning the 9/11 attacks. The plot was years in the making, notfive days. The FBI and CIA had evidence of the coming attack longer than that,but few people suspect that the federal government was behind the attacks.Osama bin Laden was born in Saudi Arabia in 1957. His mother was Syrian and hisfather was from Yemen, so Osama automatically inherited three nationalities. Hisfather had built a considerable fortune in the construction business, helped inno small part by his close ties to both the Saudi royal family and, ironicallyenough, with certain American oil dynasties, including that of President GeorgeBush.Osama certainly had a privileged upbringing – he was well-educated, trained inengineering, speaks fluent English and inherited a personal fortune in themulti-millions – but, unlike many Saudi rich kids of his generation, he heldfirmly to Wahhabi Islamic principals (“Wahhabi” is roughly equivalent to theChristian term “Puritan”). This certainly led to his present, absolutist frameof mind, but to blame Islam for the crimes of Islamic terrorists is like blamingthe Bible for the Spanish Inquisition.The Koran is one of the few holy books to stress the Allah-given right of theindividual to free thought. It also expressly forbids anyone from claiming to bea Prophet of Allah – Mohammad is said to have been the “true and final Prophet”– with the result that Islam has suffered from relatively few mad messiahs inits history. We have already seen numerous examples of just how useful such anexplicit prohibition might have been in the Christian Bible.It is certainly true that the version of Islam professed by Osama bin Laden –the repression of women, the legal curtailment of most forms of secularentertainment, the enforced growing of beards and the willingness to condonemass killing – is cruel and ultra-conservative enough to shock and disgustliberals of all stripes, but it is not strictly true that he is entirelymotivated by a hatred of Western freedoms. Bin Laden fought for years to drivethe Soviet invaders out of Afghanistan, spending much of his personal fortuneand aided by advice and assistance from the CIA (it should be noted, however,that bin Laden always refused US financial aid, apparently regarding the moneyof infidels to be unsuitable for a holy war).Despite its present “evil-doer” image in the West, al-Qaeda was essentially asupport organization for the Afghan and foreign freedom fighters, who calledthemselves the mujahideen (Arabic for “strugglers”). Bin Laden’s network wasoriginally a number of safe houses and secret training bases (al-Qaeda means“the base”) where mujahideen could rest and train to defeat the Communist and,more importantly for bin Laden, atheist interlopers.Following the victory of the Afghan freedom fighters, bin Laden returned toSaudi Arabia, and was disappointed when he and his fellow freedom fighters didnot receive a heroes’ welcome. Later, in August 1990 when the Iraqi leader,Sadam Hussein, invaded the small but oil-rich Gulf State of Kuwait, bin Ladenfeared that the secularist dictator might soon try to invade the holy motherlandof Saudi Arabia itself. He went to the Saudi authorities and offered to raise anew mujahideen army to defend the country – he clearly saw that the small Saudiarmy would be no match for the giant Iraqi war machine.He was thus infuriated when his offer was flatly refused, then becameincandescent with rage when the Saudi royal family invited half a million USsoldiers to come and defend the Saudi homeland. To call on foreigners – most ofwhom were not of the Islamic faith – to defend the holy cities of Mecca andMedina was, in bin Laden’s eyes, treachery and sacrilege combined. In 1991 hewas expelled from Saudi Arabia for stating these views too publicly.He spent the next five years in Sudan, fomenting and an anti-US interest group,but not, so far as the present evidence suggests, actually plotting anyterrorist actions. At first the Saudi government tried to woo him back byoffering to rescind his order of exile, but he refused. So they froze his knownfinancial assets and stripped him of his Saudi citizenship. The US then putpressure on the Sudanese government to expel bin Laden, prompting his return toAfghanistan.Since the withdrawal of Soviet troops, Afghanistan had been in a state ofendless civil war – first between the remains of the Soviet puppet governmentand the mujahideen freedom fighters, then between numerous petty warlords, allseeking to control Afghanistan’s huge opium trade. In contrast to the days ofthe Soviet occupation, the West – and the CIA – showed little or no interest inAfghanistan’s new agonies.Then a group of Koran students, calling themselves the Taliban, raised areligious army and swept across the country, all but wiping the warlords off themap. The West initially applauded the return of order to Afghanistan, but soonbecame uneasy at extreme theocratic tyranny set up by the Taliban.Women were essentially imprisoned in their homes and could be executed if theyallowed any man, other than their husband, see them even partially naked. Sincefemale doctors – and all other female professions – were banned, thiseffectively denied health care to the entire female population. Almost all signsof public frivolity were also outlawed and breaking any one of dozens of highlyintolerant theocratic laws could lead to a public execution – about the onlyform of public entertainment that the Taliban felt was harmless. This was theatmosphere that greeted Osama bin Laden when he returned to Afghanistan.Becoming increasingly radical, bin Laden started to make public calls for aglobal war to end American imperialism and Israeli suppression of thePalestinians – this last was undoubtedly hypocritical, as Palestinian immigrantsare also treated extremely badly in many Islamic countries. In 1998 he calledfor a fatwa (a religious ruling in the name of all Islam) to destroy the UnitedStates and those, like Israel and the Saudi royal family, who sided with them.Shortly thereafter, simultaneous bomb attacks levelled the US embassies inTanzania and Kenya, killing 258 people and injuring over 5,000. Bin Laden deniedhe was behind the attacks, but several captured terrorists implicated him as thesource of funds for the operation.In 1998, US President Bill Clinton (floundering in allegations of sexualmisconduct literally in office) gave the go-ahead for two non-nuclear cruisemissile strikes. One destroyed a factory in Sudan with financial links to binLaden. It was claimed that it was a nerve gas production facility, but laterturned out to have been a medicine factory. The second strike was aimed at binLaden himself, in Afghanistan, but failed to kill him.It is not known how many casualties were caused by these missile strikes, but ifthe US hoped to break al-Qaeda, it was to be brutally disappointed. Thanks tothe publicity resulting from the United States trying – and failing – to killone man, every Islamic fanatic on the planet started to feel kinship with binLaden. The result is the Islamic terrorist network – of which al-Qaeda is just apart – that has replaced nuclear war as the West’s greatest fear.In October 2000, a suicide bomb hidden in a small boat detonated against theside of the USS Cole, docked in the port of Aden. Seventeen US sailors werekilled. Bin Laden applauded the attack, but denied direct involvement. The worldsteeled itself for more such acts of murder, but when the next one came, on 11September 2001, it left the planet flabbergasted.The American-led invasion of Afghanistan has since crushed the Talibantheocracy, and it is now rumoured that the still fugitive bin Laden is sufferingfrom a severe kidney dysfunction. If so, it is probable that he is very ill,reliant on a dialysis machine, and is therefore unlikely to be much more than afigurehead for the global cell system of radical Islamic terrorists.To call bin Laden a mad messiah would be to overstate his importance to thebeliefs he seeks to represent, and to define al-Queda and their fellowtravellers as a cult of fanatics is to oversimplify a complex socio-politicalsituation. Murderous, bigoted thugs they may be, but their cause is far frommindless; few, even of the most extreme Islamic fundamentalists, have actuallycalled for the whole world to be forced to convert to Islam – most just want anend to excessive Western influence in Islamic affairs. Many Moslems, extremistand mainstream, argue that Western nations have unashamedly exploited andpolitically manipulated the Middle East for over a century. It was deep-seatedresentment at this ruthless economic imperialism, as they see it, that was themain cause of the 9/11 atrocity.Noam Chomsky, the respected American academic and social commentator, remarkedonly days after the 9/11 atrocity: “[It] is common knowledge among anyone whopays attention to the [Middle East] region, that the terrorists draw from areservoir of desperation, anger, and frustration that extends from rich to poor,from secular to radical Islamist. That it is rooted in no small measure in USpolicies is evident and constantly articulated to those willing to listen.”Perhaps it is not enough to only strike back at a cult that apparently hatesmost of the world – non-Moslem infidels and liberal Moslems alike. It may benecessary to ask why they hate us."}]
