My introduction to Bruce and Wendy Cathie was arefreshing change when I most needed it. Bruce was the first to publish thecoordinates of the pyramids in China. I’m especially thankful to many friendsand colleagues at the Vancouver Island Regional Library who have been sosupportive, including: Julie Berreth; Dave Devana; Penny Grant; Janice McLean;Kay Morley; Elizabeth Pack; and Leif Rosvold. Thanks to Lady Juliet Boobbyer forher assistance with the research of her father, Lord Rennell; and to Doug Kenyonof Atlantis Rising magazine, who was the first to publish the ideas that evolvedinto this book.The Atlantis Blueprint wouldn’t have been possible without the work of manyscholars, amongst them Christian and Barbara Joy O’Brien, whose groundbreakingwork in The Genius of the Few and The Shining Ones was ahead of its time. Alsothe marvellous books of Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas can’t gounmentioned. I am also in debt to three true pioneers: John Anthony West, JohnMichell and Nigel Pennick.Thanks also to Fred Hapgood and Beth Hapgood for their gracious co-operation.None of my work would have been possible without the foundation built by CharlesHapgood and Captain Arlington MalleryFinally, last but never least, gratitude to Plato and his marvellous legend ofAtlantis, which will continue to inspire many generations to come!Colin WilsonMore than most of my books, this one has been a collective effort, withco-operation and feedback from many friends.Charles Hapgood’s cousin Beth Hapgood has been tireless as a facilitator andestablisher of connections – it was she, for example, who put the authors intouch with Elwood and Daria Babbitt, who in turn did their best to help us trackdown the missing notes for what was meant to be Hapgood’s revised and finalisededition of The Path of the Pole. Beth’s friend Jim Bowles also provided someimportant hints and clues.Shawn Montgomery of Toronto, whose role is described in the second and thirdchapters, also provided a vast amount of information on a subject that is hisspeciality – scientific mavericks and forgotten geniuses – in such embarrassingquantities that this volume could easily have been twice as long.Many authors in this field of ‘anomalous’ historical research have also providedimportant information or indicated valuable lines of research. These includeJohn Michell, Andrew Collins, Robert Bauval, John West, Robert Schoch,Christopher Dunn, Robert Lomas, Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln, John Lash, IvarZapp, Lynn Picknett, Stan Gooch, Christian and Joy O’Brien, Edmund Marriage,Emilio Spedicato, Alexander Tollmann and Bill Denevan.Eddie Campbell has earned my gratitude by introducing me to Henri Bortoft’s workon Goethe.It was the fortunate chance of meeting Gerd and Maria Walton on a Nile steamerthat led to the discovery of Our Cosmic Ancestors by Maurice Chatelain, and ofChatelain’s research into the Nineveh and Quiriga numbers which has played suchan important part in this book. It was on that same Nile trip that our guide,Emil Shaker, made some highly enlightening comments on Egyptian temple ritual.I am grateful to my friend Michael Baldwin, who has read most of this book intypescript, for sending me a copy of Jeremy Narby’s The Cosmic Serpent.My son Damon arrived one weekend with a copy of Stephen Oppenheimer’s Eden inthe East, thus drawing my attention to a book that was of enormous importance inour research.Two old friends, Maurice Bassett and Ted Brown, have been indefatigable inhelping me to find hard-to-trace volumes.My thanks also to Stephen Phillips for allowing me to quote from both hispublished and unpublished work in Chapter 11.Finally, my thanks to the London Library for the loan of such rare volumes asA.E.

The adventurer pulls off his shoes but before hecan climb over the lip of the pool to seize the sunken treasure his mother pullshim back and tucks a shiny penny into his fist. ‘Make a wish,’ she urges him.With dramatic flair the coin is tossed into the water and closely watched as itsinks to the blue-tiled floor of the fountain.As I watched the child’s initiation into the wishing ritual I wondered just howmany coin tossers know the true origin of this romantic superstition.In ancient times flowing water was cherished as a gift from the gods. Whereverthe earth goddess allowed it to appear was considered a sacred place. To expresstheir gratitude, people would leave a small gift at the site. This tradition wasretained even after humans learned to find water by digging wells.Then came a subtle but lasting change in our worldview. We began to controlnature, to bend it to our own design. The original religious impulse to honourthe gods and goddesses faded, and was transformed into acts of magic designed toappropriate their powers for our personal use.Today, when we pause in the midst of the bustle of a shopping centre or lingerat a cool fountain while on holiday to toss a coin into a fountain, most of usare unaware that we are miming an ancient ritual. A shopping mall receives itswater from an elaborate system of pipes and filters, its true origin possiblymiles away. And in spirit it is even further removed from the idea of the giftfrom a goddess. It marks no sacred place.But in the ancient world location held tremendous significance. Certain placeswere so holy that only a handful of visitors were permitted entrance. A web ofintricate meaning surrounded rivers, lakes and forests. In time, thissignificance was transferred to temples, pyramids and other monuments built uponsacred ground. There was profound meaning to where we lived and to where weworshipped, because so much depended on our relationship with the earth.With the coming of agriculture, humanity broke that covenant with nature. Nolonger did we feel subject to a careful order overseen by a powerful earthgoddess. As hoes broke open the soil, we realised that nature could be forced toour will. But part of the price we paid for that power was fear: fear that thegods would seek vengeance for our disruption of nature.At Delphi, the ancient Greeks honoured a sacred rock called the ‘ omphalos’,which marked the ‘navel’ or ‘centre’ of the earth. A myth tells the story of itsorigin. From the opposite ends of the earth Zeus released two eagles. One flewwest and the other east. Eventually the two birds crossed flight paths atDelphi, thus designating that city as the centre of the world. But before Delphicould be occupied, the sun god, Apollo, had to sanctify its ground throughbattle with a gigantic serpent, ‘Python’, who lived beneath the earth.Like the dragons of ancient China, Python was thought to be dangerouslyunpredictable, but after a valiant struggle Apollo triumphed in taming thecreature by driving a lance through its head. In celebration, a sacred rock, theomphalos, was placed over the spot of Apollo’s victory.In ancient Japan, a similar story was told in Hitachi Province, where a seamonster by the name of Hishin-Uwo was thought to be responsible for earthquakes.A god pinned down this creature with a river-rock called the Kaus-mi-ishi sothat he could temper the fearful shaking of the earth.And at Deli, in India, there is an iron pillar driven so deep into the groundthat it was believed that it had impaled the head of the serpent king, Vasuki,thus keeping the world safe as long as this pillar remained in place.Widespread myths testify to the ancient belief that certain places on earth aresacred and demand respect. Often, as in the case of Delphi, these sites wereperceived to hold the extraordinary power of also being the centre or the navelof the earth. Cuzco in the central Andes, Nippur in ancient Sumeria, Jerusalem,Mecca, Easter Island and Deli have all at one time been held in such esteem.Many ancient people regarded the world as a giant disc floating upon the world’socean. The holy city lay at what its citizens believed to be the exact centre ofthe earth-disc. When constructing temples and monuments, the ancients alignedtheir buildings with great precision so as not to dishonour any gods. This wasconsidered a practical duty, since if a sacred site was marred by improperplacement then the uncontrollable forces of nature could be released, followedby disaster.Feng shui is the Chinese art of divining the most fortuitous arrangement ofspace. The foundation stone of each new building was always selected with greatcare since it was considered the anchor of the whole edifice and its positionwould prevent the violent actions of underground spirits from destroying thestructure. The entire surrounding environment was also carefully considered.Mountains were thought to harbour dragons that, if not appeased, might arisefrom their slumber and destroy the works of humans. If a peak was not perfectlybalanced, it must be modified. The Chinese were terraformers, reshaping theelevations of the earth around them to ensure perfect harmony.Numerous tactics were adopted to allow the free flow of ‘chi’, the positiveenergy believed to stream throughout the universe. Mirrors and fountains, ifproperly arranged, could enhance the positive flow of chi and, by avoiding adesign that included straight lines, evil forces might be diverted from homesand places of work.Around AD1700 the Jesuits arrived in China. During their tenure theysystematically destroyed any books about feng shui while hypocritically copyingthe writings. So it was only a matter of time before the ancient Chinesepractice was finding its way into the design of such sites as Versailles. Theoriginal plans of the famous French palace built for Louis XIV were rectangularin shape, but the secret application of feng shui forced a change. Winding pathsand kiosks were introduced to please the eye, and if they also warded off evilspirits, so much the better. This notion that a place holds intrinsic meaning iscalled geomancyJust as astrology evolved into astronomy, and alchemy became chemistry, so hasthe ancient science of geomancy found its modern equivalent in geology, theforgotten science of antiquity. Unlike astrology/astronomy, which conjures upimages of a priest gazing at the stars, or alchemy/chemistry, which brings tomind Frankenstein-like laboratories filled with test tubes and foaming gases,geomancy/geology is devoid of a popular image, but it was once an esteemedscience.At the heart of geology lies another ancient science, geometry. Geometry, whichmeans ‘the measuring of the earth’, is a science that was practised, as we shallsee, throughout the globe, but most purposefully in ancient Egypt, where theannual flooding of the Nile drowned the boundaries between farming plots. InSacred Geometry: Symbolism and Purpose in Religious Structures, Nigel Pennickexplains the process undertaken by the priests to restore order each year:Of necessity, the method of surveying had to be practical and simple. Itrequired but two men and a knotted rope, and the knowledge of the so-called‘Pythagorean’ triangle, centuries before Pythagoras walked this earth.The laying out of areas required a foolproof method for the production of theright angle. This was achieved by marking off the rope with thirteen equaldivisions. Four units then formed one side of the triangle, three another andfive the hypotenuse opposite the right angle. This simple method has persistedto this day, and was used when tomb and temple building began. It was the originof the historic ‘cording of the temple’, and from this technique it was arelatively simple task to lay out rectangles and other more complex geometricalfigures.1The ‘cording of the temple’, using a simple rope with thirteen knots, turns outto be an important clue about the origins of the people who brought sacredgeometry to Egypt.Underlying the idea of geomancy is the assumption that there is something uniqueabout sacred sites that prompted people to construct marvellous monuments atspecific locations. Some authors have speculated that the ancients knew offorces within the earth that emitted energy at particular points on its surface.This energy might be psychic, as in the case of Delphi, where the spirit of theearth goddess’s serpent, Typhon, released powers that the priests andpriestesses drew upon to devise oracles. Other authors, such as Bruce Cathie,believe that there are sacred sites at critical points on the earth’s surfacewhere the ancients could tap a universal energy flowing through the planet.2But perhaps there is another explanation for the placement of the sanctifiedmonuments? John Michell, in City of Revelation, comments that ‘the traditionsrelating to these monuments are unanimous in claiming that they are relics of aformer elemental science, founded upon principles of which we are nowignorant’.3 Among Masons the search for these lost principles has become anessential feature of their secret society. In November 1752, when GeorgeWashington became a Mason in Fredericksonburg, he heard the following words:The proper business of a Mason is astronomical, chemical, geological and moralscience, and more particularly that of the ancients, with all the mysteries andfables founded upon it.Let us endeavor to turn the stream; to go from priestcraft to science, frommystery to knowledge, from allegory to real history.[italics added].4Whatever we may think of the Masons in modern times, we can perhaps agree thatthe priest-craft of geomancy needs to be reborn.Just as astrology may well be a form of degenerated astronomy and alchemy mayhave had its origins in the science of chemistry, so might not geomancy be adebased form of ancient geology? That was the question that ultimately sent meon the quest that would become The Atlantis Blueprint.Today we assume that sacred sites such as the Egyptian, Chinese and SouthAmerican pyramids were built by local people for local reasons, but The AtlantisBlueprint will reveal that there is a single global pattern that ties thesemonuments together. This in turn implies the existence of an advancedcivilisation that existed before the flood and managed to communicate importantgeodesic, geological and geometric information to people who became ancientmariners and recharted the globe.This knowledge was periodically lost and rediscovered: first by an unknownpeople who may have been centred in Lebanon, and then by the Phoenicians, andmost recently by the Knights Templar. This lost civilisation preserved some ofits great knowledge as a gift to future generations.Joining me in the quest is Colin Wilson, author of scores of books, includingFrom Atlantis to the Sphinx.Our collaboration had an unexpected beginning. Colin had written an introductionto When the Sky Fell: In Search of Atlantis, the book that my wife, Rose, and Ipublished in 1995. In the winter of 1997–8 he sent me a fax asking if I couldverify Charles Hapgood’s signature on a copy of his first important book,Earth’s Shifting Crust. Colin knew that I was familiar with Hapgood’s signaturebecause of my correspondence with him from 1977 to 1982. I was happy to be ableto tell him that the book had indeed been signed by Charles.Colin and I stayed in touch and he sent me a copy of a documentary called TheFlood that he’d introduced and in which I had appeared. It was around that timethat I had decided to gather together the previous four years of research into anew book. Rose was occupied with working on her first novel5 and so I wastemporarily without a co-author. I wondered if Colin would be interested injoining me in this adventure? To give him an idea about where the latest workhad taken me, I sent him an article called ‘Blueprints from Atlantis’ that wasabout to be published in the American magazine Atlantis Rising (see Appendix 1).After reading the article Colin phoned to say he was keen to join me in thequest.We began with the death of a professor in New England.Author’s note: The text of The Atlantis Blueprint has been jointly written byRand Flem-Ath and Colin Wilson. However, to enable the reader to distinguishbetween their individual voices, Colin Wilson takes the role of first-personnarrator and Rand Flem-Ath contributes in the third person."},{"pageContent":"1HAPGOOD'S SECRET QUEST FOR ATLANTISON A RAINY night in December 1982, a retired New England professor ofanthropology named Charles Hapgood stepped off the pavement without looking leftand was hit by an oncoming car. He died in hospital three days later.1Two months earlier he had sorted out his books and papers, and invited his sonsto come and take what they wanted. He had been retired for sixteen years, and,at the age of seventy-eight, had the satisfaction of knowing that the lastthirty years of his life had produced work of amazing originality. Earth’sShifting Crust (1958),2 written with the active encouragement and co-operationof Albert Einstein, had proposed a revolutionary new theory of the great iceages: namely, that the crust of the earth can slide,3 like the skin on coldgravy, under the weight of polar ice caps, and move whole continents around. Butperhaps his most revolutionary book was Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings (1966),4which proved beyond reasonable doubt that civilisation is far older thanhistorians had suspected; it should have brought him worldwide celebrity, sincehis arguments were irrefutable. He also produced a second edition of Earth’sShifting Crust (called The Path of the Pole, 1970)5 with still more evidence forhis theory of crust slippage.Born in 1904, Hapgood had graduated from Harvard in philosophy of science, thenstudied at Freiburg during the 1930s, when he witnessed the rise of the Nazis.At the outbreak of the Second World War, he was inducted into the Office ofStrategic Studies – the forerunner of the CIA – as an expert on Germany. Whenthe war was over, Hapgood became a professor of anthropology at SpringfieldCollege in Massachusetts.He was a good teacher, who believed in involving his students as much aspossible. When, in 1949, a student named Henry Warrington asked him about thelost continent of Mu, the legendary civilisation that is supposed to have beenengulfed by the Pacific Ocean, Hapgood told him to go away to research it, thenreport back to the class. As an afterthought, he told Warrington to examine theevidence for Atlantis too.6Warrington had only to consult any good encyclopaedia to learn that in the 1850san English zoologist named P. L. Sclater had observed a strange similaritybetween animals and plants as far apart as India and Australia, and suggestedthat there must have been a land bridge between the Malay archipelago and thesouth coast of Asia during the Eocene Age, around 55 million years ago. Hecalled this Lemuria, because his missing continent connected places where lemurs– a primate species – were common.The existence of Lemuria became incorporated into the teachings of the eccentricgenius Madame Blavatsky, who said it was the home of what she called the ‘thirdroot race’, predecessors of human beings who looked like giant apes andcommunicated by telepathy, who were followed by Atlantis, then our currentcivilisation, the fifth root race. But, since only members of the TheosophicalSociety took Madame Blavatsky seriously, this view of Lemuria failed to gainwide currency.In the 1880s a brilliant but erratic French scholar called Augustus Le Plongeonclaimed to be able to read texts of the ancient Maya of Mexico, where he said hehad found references to a continent called Mu that had vanished beneath thewaves after tremendous earthquakes. Few took him seriously. Then in 1926 aBritish ex-intelligence officer named James Churchward, who had been a colonelin the Bengal Lancers, wrote a book called The Lost Continent of Mu,7 followingit up with four sequels. Churchward had a friend called William Niven, aScottish engineer and amateur archaeologist, who had been excavating near avillage called Amantia, north of Mexico City, when he found hundreds of tabletsapparently written in the Mayan script. From their depth, Niven judged them tobe more than 12,000 years old. Contemporary Mayan scholars were unable todecipher the script, but when Niven showed some of the tablets to Churchward,the ex-lancer claimed to be able to read it. During his time in India, heexplained, he had formed a friendship with a Hindu priest who, when he learnedthat the young British officer was interested in archaeology, spent two yearsteaching him to read inscriptions that, he claimed, were written in Naacal,which was the original tongue of mankind and also the language of the lostcontinent of Mu. And now Niven had demonstrated the truth of another assertionof Churchward’s mentor: that the priesthood of Mu had sent emissaries to CentralAmerica to teach their secret knowledge and to prepare a place of refuge in theevent of the destruction of their own civilisation. This had finally come about,according to Churchward, about 50,000 years ago.Because Churchward made no attempt at a scholarly presentation, his books weregenerally dismissed as fantasy. When Henry Warrington presented his report toCharles Hapgood’s class at Springfield College, everyone agreed that there wasno real evidence for Mu.Atlantis was a different matter. It had first been described by Plato in two ofhis dialogues, the Timaeus and Critias, and the Greek Neoplatonist philosopherProclus had stated that Plato’s student Crantor (c.340–275 BC)had visited Egypt,where he saw pillars inscribed with the legend of Atlantis.In the Timaeus, Plato’s uncle, Critias, describes how his ancestor Solon(639–559 BC),the great statesman, had visited Egypt about two centuries earlier.Realising that the Egyptians knew far more about history than the Greeks, helured a group of priests to talk about the past by telling them what he knew ofGreek history. The bait was successful; an old priest told him, ‘Oh Solon,Solon, you Greeks are all children.’ He went on to say that the earth hadexperienced many catastrophes that had almost destroyed mankind, some by fire,some by water, and some by other means. But 9,000 years before (i.e. about 9,600BC),one of the greatest of these catastrophes had occurred – a destruction bywater. At this time, Solon was told, Athens already existed, and out in theocean, beyond the Pillars of Hercules (which we now know as the Straits ofGibraltar), there was an island-continent called Atlantis, ‘as large as Libyaand Asia combined’. (By Libya he meant all of North Africa and by Asia he meantan area equivalent to the Middle East.)The priest then made a baffling statement. From Atlantis, he explained, it waspossible to reach other islands that formed part of Atlantis, ‘and from them,the whole opposite continent that surrounds what can be truly called the ocean’.It is conceivable that, by the ‘opposite continent’, the priest was referring toAmerica – for there is evidence that Europeans visited America thousands ofyears before Columbus – but to say that the opposite continent surrounds theocean sounds odd. Sea can surround a continent, but surely a continent does notsurround the sea?On Atlantis, said the priest, a powerful dynasty of kings had succeeded inextending their empire as far as the borders of Egypt. Their next ambition wasto conquer Egypt and Greece. But Greece had resisted; an alliance led by Athenssucceeded in defeating the Atlanteans. After this, a tremendous catastrophe,involving earthquakes and floods, destroyed most of the Greeks, and engulfedAtlantis under the waves.This is not the usual version of history. According to the Oxford ClassicalDictionary, Athens probably dates from about 900 BC,possibly a few centuriesearlier. Even though it admits that ‘the more substantial remains of laterperiods have largely effaced prehistoric settlement evidence’, there is still ahuge gap between 900 BCand 9,000 BC.On the other hand, we know that archaeologyis continually pushing back the age of civilisation. In the 1960s, Jericho – thefirst walled city – was believed to date from about 6,500 BC,but it is nowbelieved to date from at least 2,000 years earlier. ‘The great stone wall, sometwenty feet high and nine feet thick, was joined by at least one apsidal towerwhich… would not have disgraced one of the more impressive mediaeval castles,’says one expert.8 But early settlers do not build walls and towers like that;they build one-room huts. It took European man about 1,000 years to move fromfortified wooden barricades to medieval castles. So Jericho might well be as oldas 8,000 BC.And in that case, why not Athens?In the Critias, Plato continues the story. Atlantis was founded by the sea godPoseidon (Neptune), who fathered five pairs of twins on a mortal woman. The godbuilt her a home on a hill, and surrounded it with concentric rings of sea andland. The twins were each allotted a portion of the island, and over thegenerations extended their conquests to other islands and to the mainland ofEurope.Great engineers, the Atlanteans built a circular city, 11 miles in diameter,with a metal wall and a huge canal connecting it to the sea. Behind the citythere was a plain 229 by 343 miles wide, on which farmers grew the city’s foodsupply. Behind this were mountains with fertile meadows and every kind oflivestock, including elephants. Plato spends many pages describing themagnificent buildings, with hot and cold fountains, communal dining halls andpalaces of many-coloured stone, then goes on to describe the Atlantean socialstructure at equal length.As time went by, the Critias goes on, the god-like element among the Atlanteansbecame diluted with human stock and they were no longer able ‘to carry theirprosperity with moderation’. The meaning is quite clear: undisturbed prosperitymakes human beings lazy, and those who are too aggressive to allow themselves tovegetate fly from boredom by using up their energies in a struggle for power andwealth (things have not changed all that much). Although the Atlanteans regardedthemselves as fortunate and contented, the gods were fully aware of theircorruption. So Zeus summoned all the gods to a meeting in his palace…And at that point, the Critias breaks off. Plato never completed it, or went onto write the third dialogue of a projected trilogy, the Hermocrates. Thelikeliest explanation is that his plans were interrupted by illness and death –he died at the age of eighty.The story of Atlantis continued to fascinate readers for more than 2,000 years.In the nineteenth century an American congressman named Ignatius Donnelly wrotethe first complete study of the legend, concluding that it is almost certainly arecord of fact. Atlantis, The Antediluvian World,9 which has been in print eversince it was first published in 1882, is a work of extraordinary range thatargues that the colonies of Atlantis included North and South America, as wellas Egypt and Spain, and is inclined to believe that the Azores, in themid-Atlantic, are the only part of the sunken island that remains visible.Donnelly came close to persuading the British prime minister Gladstone to send anaval vessel to look for Atlantean remains.Donnelly – described as ‘the most erudite man ever to sit in Congress’ – seemsto have been a remarkable man. He was the author of an influential bookproposing that William Shakespeare was in fact Francis Bacon, while a sequel tohis text on Atlantis, Ragnarok, The Age of Fire and Gravel (1883),10 set out toexplain the origins of the layer of sand, gravel and clay that covers most ofour earth, arguing that it was left behind after a flood caused by the impact ofsome great comet which vaporised oceans and caused an age of darkness. Thishappened, Donnelly suggests, when man had already begun to establishcivilisation, and the event is reflected in many myths of catastrophe. The areawhere the comet struck, he thinks, may have been the mid-Atlantic – in short,Atlantis.It is an interesting speculation, for a cometary impact is as good anexplanation as any for the destruction of Plato’s legendary civilisation. ButDonnelly’s belief that Atlantis was located in the mid-Atlantic cannot besustained. The explanation is summarised in a popular volume on mysteriespublished in 1961:At first sight the configuration of the bed of the Atlantic between Bermuda andSpain appears to confirm the former existence of Atlantis. Depth sounderscarried westwards from Spain disclose first a valley three thousand feet indepth, the sea bed then rising perpendicularly to the summits of the Azoreswhich are in effect the tops of a high mountain range which runs under the seanorth and south in the Atlantic. The ocean bed then drops to another valley twothousand feet deep and rises steeply again to the island of Bermuda, anothermountain top. It appears, therefore, that the Azores represent the lastremaining outposts of Atlantis. But geological surveys of the ocean bed havedisclosed that, if any subsidences took place, they occurred at a date a hundredthousand years or more before the time of the supposed loss of Atlantis.11This, then, would appear to rule out the existence of Atlantis in the AtlanticOcean – at least, if it was the size of North Africa and the Middle Eastcombined.As Hapgood reread Plato’s account, he was struck by the fact that this soundedlike a description of something that had actually happened. It seemed to himthat the most interesting question was not so much where Atlantis was located,but what could have caused such a catastrophe. No volcanic eruption could begreat enough to wreck a whole continent and extend its destructiveness as far asGreece.A trivial domestic incident started a new train of thought. Hapgood had put aheavy rug, rolled into a bundle, into the washing machine, and when the drum hadbegun to spin, the machine shook until it tore the bolts out of the kitchenfloor. At roughly the same time as this incident, a friend of Hapgood, HughAuchinloss Brown, an engineer, suggested his own theory of how an earthcatastrophe could have taken place. The earth’s polar ice caps are huge,Antarctica’s alone being about twice as large as the United States; the northernice cap is almost entirely floating ice, but Antarctica, on the other hand, is avast continent covered with ice. Since the earth is continually spinning like awashing machine, its ice cap could act like the bunched-up rug, causing anuneven distribution of mass. Auchinloss Brown even went so far as to proposethat the mass of ice at the poles can cause the earth to topple on to its sideevery 7,000 years, a view that was used by the science fiction writer AllanEckert in a novel called The Hab Theory, ‘HAB’, being Auchinloss Brown’sinitials.Auchinloss Brown pointed out that there is a significant difference between therotations of a washing machine and our planet. Because it spins on its axis, theearth is ‘fatter’ at the equator than at the poles, so in effect it is like anenormous flywheel whose spin stabilises itself. A flywheel would spinerratically if someone attached a weight to its edge, but the polar ice is noton the edge but, so to speak, at the centre of the wheel. Hapgood had to try towork out the mass of irregular ice that could cause the wheel to ‘judder’. Heasked a colleague to calculate the centre of gravity of the Antarctic ice cap,which has an irregular shape. He learned that the centre of gravity ofAntarctica was around 340 miles to the west of thePole itself, which meant that when the ice reached a certain thickness,Antarctica could, in theory, cause a bunched-up-rug effect. Then he had to workout whether this irregular sheet of ice, much of it 2 miles thick, could causethe flywheel to judder. The answer, when it came, was disappointing. Theflywheel-stabilising effect was thousands of times greater than the weight ofice at the South Pole. Auchinloss Brown’s ‘Hab theory’ was also disproved.At this low point, his friend James Hunter Campbell, an engineer and inventorand an associate of Thomas Edison’s, made a suggestion that completely changedthe direction of the investigation. Surely, said Campbell, there was no need forthe bunched-up-rug effect to make the whole earth wobble on its axis? Theearth’s crust is a fairly thin layer of solid matter, between 20 and 40 milesthick, which floats on a sea of molten rock, so the mass of irregular ice wouldonly have to make the earth’s crust slip on the liquid underneath.This was Hapgood’s great breakthrough. Suddenly he had the makings of aplausible theory about what might have happened to Atlantis. Moreover, he hadextremely powerful support in the theories of a German meteorologist namedAlfred Lothar Wegener, who had taught at the University of Graz. Around 1910Wegener had pointed out that we only have to look at a map of the world to seethat the bulge on the coast of South America appears to fit very neatly into thehollow on the coast of Africa. Is it not possible that they were once part ofthe same continent, then drifted apart? Wegener labelled his hypotheticalsupercontinent Pangaea.Wegener’s Hypothesis, as it was known, was presented to the academic world in1915 in a book called The Origin of the Continents and Oceans.12 It encounteredfurious resistance, and was widely ridiculed. What, his colleagues wanted toknow, had driven the continents apart? Why should they drift apart when thesurface of the earth is obviously solid? Wegener’s reply was along the samelines as Sclater’s observations on Lemuria in the 1850s: there were similar rockstrata and fossils in both Africa and South America. That, said his opponents,was coincidence.Wegener struggled on, aware that he had lost the battle, and by 1930 his theoryhad been generally rejected. He went on a final expedition to Greenland, wherehe met his death from a heart attack induced by overexertion. His theory waspromptly forgotten.His critics were not entirely wrong. His theory was based on twopresuppositions: that the sea bed is a smooth plane, so that continents candrift over it like immense rafts; and that it is soft and plastic. In fact thesea bed is not flat – it is often mountainous – and the rock of the sea bed isrigid. Yet Wegener’s basic intuition – that the continents were once a solidland mass that has since split apart – was correct, and was recognised as suchwithin a few decades of his death. His name can now be found in every dictionaryof science.In 1952, Hapgood was in effect re-examining the Wegener Hypothesis – with oneimportant difference. Unlike Wegener, Hapgood had a clear idea of what mightcause ‘continental drift’: the mass of polar ice. He decided to try to enlistthe support of the most famous living scientist, Albert Einstein. Hapgood hadwritten to him before, with some questions about the nature of the expandinguniverse, and Einstein had replied. Hapgood wrote again, this time askingwhether Einstein thought that radioactive elements such as radium might be builtup in the earth’s crust from simpler elements because of the enormous pressures.Although his reply has been lost, Einstein seems to have shown interest, for, on15 November 1952, two weeks after his first letter, Hapgood was sending him alengthy memorandum about the forces exerted by the earth’s crust. He made onecomment that would be central to his whole theory. Noting the size of the lastgreat American ice sheet, known as the Wisconsin, Hapgood pointed out that if ithad extended as far north as the present North Pole, its weight would have beenso great that it would have pulled the globe sideways.(Hapgood used the term ‘careened’.) The answer, Hapgood thought, was that theNorth Pole was not then in its present position, but further south in HudsonBay.Einstein immediately grasped the essence of the rather diffuse memorandum; hereplied nine days later (24 November 1952),13 remarking that he had once read apopular article suggesting that an irregular mass of ice at the poles couldcause the earth’s crust to slip. And he advised Hapgood that, in his opinion, ‘acareful study of this hypothesis is really desirable’.That was exactly what Hapgood wanted – encouragement from the world’s mostfamous scientist to go ahead and develop his theory of the earth’s shiftingcrust. His reaction was to begin to write a book about his theory.It was six months before he wrote to Einstein again, when he enclosed thetypescript of ‘The Ice Age’, the first chapter of his book. A mere century ago,Hapgood pointed out, people were simply unable to accept that the earth had oncebeen covered with vast sheets of ice, but finally, the evidence became toopowerful to ignore. Not only the extreme northern and southern regions had beencovered with ice, but India and Africa too. In fact, we now know that in thePre-Cambrian Era, about 800 million years ago, the whole earth remained frozensolid almost as far as the equator, and that this ice age lasted for another 300million years. Nothing as extreme has happened since, but the earth has passedthrough a succession of ice ages whose cause is still a mystery.If ice ages occurred at regular intervals, an obvious explanation would be thatthe solar system passes periodically through some giant cloud of cosmic dust,but they have no perceptible pattern of frequency, so other theories must beconsidered.In 1872, a Scotsman named James Croll produced a book called Climate and Time,arguing that the key to the ice ages lies in the tilt of the earth’s axis, whichcauses our winter and summer; at present it is 23.4 degrees. If there were notilt, there would be no seasons. It follows that if the tilt were increased,winter and summer would be more extreme. In fact, the tilt does increase, as faras 24.4 degrees, and this, Croll suggested, can produce ice ages.In 1920 a Serbian scientist named Milutin Milankovich developed this ideafurther. He contended that the movement of the earth around the sun varies inthree ways: the tilt of the earth’s axis, which varies slightly over 41,000years; the point when its orbit comes closest to the sun (called theperihelion), which varies every 22,000 years; and the slight changes in theorbit (known as eccentricity), which vary over a period of 100,000 years.Milankovich suggested that if these three factors coincide, they cause an iceage. For the next twenty years, Milankovich continued to produce charts andgraphs, and cli-matologists were deeply impressed. Milankovich was onlyconcerned with the Pleistocene, the most recent geological epoch, which ended amere 10,000 years ago, but his graph of the Pleistocene – ‘the Milankovichcurve’ – showed the climatic changes of the Pleistocene in remarkable detail.The problem with the Milankovich theory is that, while it can explain smallfluctuations in the earth’s climate, it cannot answer the question of why vastice sheets extended beyond the tropics. The 300-million-year-long ice age of thePre-Cambrian seems to require something more than three orbital variationsoccurring at the same time.Another interesting theory was put forward by the meteorologist Sir GeorgeSimpson in the 1950s. His notions sound totally paradoxical: that ice ages arecaused by an increase in heat from the sun. Simpson pointed out that an increasein the sun’s heat would cause heavier rainfall, as the sun would evaporate morewater from the sea (that is why the tropics have monsoons). In the polarregions, precipitation falls as snow, and if more snow falls in winter than canevaporate in summer, the ice caps will grow larger and larger, and the resultwill be an ice age. But if increased solar radiation caused the ice ages, itshould also have warmed the seas, until most of the ice-free ocean was as warmas the Mediterranean. A study of shell deposits on the sea bottom, carried outby Cesare Emiliani of the University of Chicago, shows no such rise intemperature, so Simpson’s theory also has to be abandoned.There is one more likely possibility: that ice ages are caused by volcanic dustin the earth’s atmosphere. During the first part of the twentieth century, therewas a lessening of volcanic activity, resulting in the long, hot summers thatcan be remembered by those born before 1950. An increase in volcanic eruptionshas brought an increased variability in the weather – rainy summers, warmwinters. What causes this rise in volcanic activity? One theory suggests thatthe earth may have been struck by large meteors or small asteroids, but therehave been no such major strikes since the great Tunguska explosion whichdevastated hundreds of square miles of Siberian forest in 1908.We still have no firm ideas about the causes of the ice ages, but Hapgood wenton to raise an even more baffling question: why are the records of ice ages notdistributed across locations where you would expect them to be found, namelyshowing ice spreading from the poles and working towards the equator? How can weexplain the recent ice ages that left Siberia and Alaska untouched, yet frozeEurope almost as far south as London and Berlin? And what about the ice sheetthat covered India and moved northwards in the Carboniferous Period? Oneexplanation might be that around 300 million years ago this part of India wasmuch higher – and therefore colder – than today, but there were also vast icesheets at sea level in Asia, Africa and Australia, and ice sheets in Africa andMadagascar also spread ‘the wrong way’, from the equator.You might also expect that an ice age would affect the northern and southernhemispheres at the same time. Not so; there is evidence to show that there havebeen ice sheets in the southern hemisphere but not at the same time in thenorth, and vice versa.If you assume that the earth’s crust cannot move, and that the land that is nowat the North and South Poles has always been located at the same places, thesefacts cannot be supported. Instead assume that the earth’s crust can movearound, and all is explained: the ice that almost reached the latitude of Londonwhile Siberia remained unfrozen, the ice sheet over India, and otherirregularities.Hapgood was lucky to have a friend in the zoologist Ivan Sanderson, who wasinterested in what are now called ‘anomalies’, meaning strange and unexplainedphenomena. It was Sanderson who brought to his attention the Russian scientistImmanuel Velikovsky’s investigations of the Beresovka mammoth, found frozen inSiberia around 1901 in a half-standing position with buttercups in its mouth.Obviously, for such flora to have been growing, the climate had changed verysuddenly, but how could even an earth crust slippage have caused the temperatureto drop so rapidly? Hapgood had himself been in Canada one Indian summer; it hadbeen hot enough for him to bathe in a lake and then dry out in the sun, untilsuddenly the wind had changed to north-west and the temperature had dropped sothat the lake was frozen over within hours. He imagined the Beresovka mammothchewing buttercups in a warm meadow when a storm had blown up, with a wind of150 miles an hour. (One of the consequences of volcanic dust in the air is anincrease in the temperature difference between poles and equator and morepowerful winds.)But why were other mammoths not affected? The answer is that they were – intheir thousands. Twenty thousand mammoth tusks were exported from Siberia in thelast decades of the nineteenth century and thousands more must have remainedburied. Ivory is unusable unless it comes from freshly killed animals, or can befrozen very quickly. Many of the frozen mammoths were perfectly edible,indicating that they had been frozen to temperatures well below zero and keptlike that for thousands of years. If meat is merely kept at or around freezingpoint, ice crystals form and ‘spoil’ it by disrupting the cells. Evidently, somehuge catastrophe plunged Siberia from a warm day into sub-zero temperatures thatlasted 15,000 years.Hapgood then discussed the mastodon bones found in New York State around 1880,which at the time were assumed to prove that mastodons survived the Ice Age.Subsequent geological studies have proved that, like the Siberian mammoths, theywere caught by a sudden drop in temperature, then in the ice sheet thatsubsequently formed, so the mastodons of North America – as well as bears,horses, giant beavers, deer, caribou, elk and bison – were also overtaken bycatastrophe. The basic difference was that Siberia became freezing cold. Why?Because it had moved north.Einstein read Hapgood’s material and replied within five days: ‘I find yourarguments very impressive and have the impression that your hypothesis iscorrect. One can hardly doubt that significant shifts of the earth’s crust havetaken place repeatedly and within a short time.’14 His encouragement led Hapgoodto send him more of the typescript. In spring 1954, Einstein supported Hapgood’sapplication for a grant or research appointment at the Institute of AdvancedStudies at Princeton, where Einstein was based.15 Unfortunately, RobertOppenheimer, the ‘father of the atom bomb’, who was an influential member of thecommittee, opposed Hapgood, and the request was turned down. On 18 May 1954,Einstein wrote to express his sympathy, and, perhaps as a consolation prize,sent Hapgood a short introduction to the book that would become Earth’s ShiftingCrust, probably recognising that, in the long run, this would be worth more thana grant.Again, in November 1954, Einstein supported Hapgood’s request for a researchgrant from the Guggenheim Foundation. Once again, it was turned down. Thefollowing January, Hapgood and Campbell called on Einstein at Princeton and helda long discussion which Hapgood wrote up into an account that he later sent toEinstein, who agreed that it was accurate, although he asked not to be quoted,since his remarks had been made without preparation. Hapgood later reprinted thenotes in Earth’s Shifting Crust. Campbell was trying to work out the mathematicsof how the Antarctic ice cap could cause the earth’s crust to fracture. Einsteinwas totally convinced by Hapgood’s geological evidence that the earth’s crustcould fracture and slide; what he doubted was whether the polar ice cap hadanything to do with it, a view that Hapgood had come to share by the time heissued the second edition, The Path of the Pole, in 1970. He simply doubtedwhether the mass of ice – even when contained in an irregular shape likeAntarctica – could cause the crust to slip.On 16 April, at the age of seventy-six, Einstein died in hospital. Hapgood hadlost his most influential champion, but at last Earth’s Shifting Crust was nowalmost completed. What had once seemed a wild theory was steadily gatheringsupport from other sources. Professor George W. Bain realised that the chemicalcomposition of soil is altered by sunlight, and discovered that, for example,tropical soil is quite different from soil in a cool zone. His studies of veryearly geological periods led him to conclude that in the Carboniferous Period,the equator ran through the New Siberian Islands – or, to put it another way,that Siberia was located closer to the equator.Bain published his results in 1953. For twenty years before that, the Chineseprofessor Ting Ying H. Ma, of the University of Fukien,16 had been studyingcorals and had reached similar conclusions: ancient coral seas were not in thesame position as at present, but in fact changed their position from age to age.At first Ma tried to explain this by Wegener’s theory of drifting continents,but by 1949, when Hapgood started working on the problem, he had concluded thatonly shifts in the earth’s crust itself could account for the patterns ofchange. Ma suspected that the movement went deeper than the crust, into themantle, the layer below the crust.For Hapgood, five years’ work was drawing to a close; all that remained now wasto find a publisher. And at this juncture, another fascinating investigationfell into his lap.On 26 August 1956, a radio broadcast from Georgetown University, in Washington,DC,17 featured a panel discussion in which the leading speaker was a scholar ofViking maps, Captain Arlington H. Mallery. The panel was arguing about a map,dating from 1513, that bore an inscription stating that it had been piecedtogether from a number of other old maps by a Turkish seafarer and one-timepirate named Piri Reis (‘piri’ means admiral); Reis was apparently eventuallybeheaded through the machinations of an enemy in 1554. His map showed SouthAmerica, a portion of West Africa and, at the bottom, what appeared to be partof the coast of Antarctica. Earlier that year, Mallery had been reading anarticle in the Geographical Journal about discoveries made in Antarctica duringan international exploration in 1949, including sonar soundings under the icethat surrounded the coast.18 At that moment his friend M.I. Walters dropped onhis desk a copy of the Piri Reis map, which had recently been presented to theLibrary of Congress by a Turkish officer. A single glance showed Mallery thatthere appeared to be an amazing correspondence between the bays shown on thePiri Reis map and the bays recently revealed by the sonar. Piri Reis himself hadstated that some of the twenty maps he had used dated back to the time ofAlexander the Great, who was born in 356 BC.Since Antarctica was undoubtedly bythat time covered with a sheet of ice – much of it 2 miles deep – these originalmaps must have been made long before Alexander – at a conservative estimate,around 4,000 BC.But a map is no use without something written on it, and writing was notsupposed to have been developed until the Sumerians began to use it for taxdemands around 3,500 BC.It looked very much as if the Piri Reis map proved thatwriting had been in use long before 4,000 BC.Furthermore, Antarctica itself wasnot officially discovered until 1818. The Piri Reis map suggested the existenceof a sophisticated seafaring civilisation at a time when, according tohistorians, civilisation was only just evolving in the Middle East.Understandably, in view of his interest in Antarctica, Hapgood was tremendouslyexcited by the new discovery. He had already concluded that, before the lastgreat crust slippage, Lesser Antarctica – the smaller half of the dividedcontinent, directly south of Patagonia – was located outside the AntarcticCircle, and had later moved inside it, so it would quite probably have been freeof ice in 9,600 BC,when, according to Plato, Atlantis had vanished. AlthoughHapgood had no intention of breathing a word about it to anyone – he had nodesire to be dismissed as a member of the lunatic fringe – it looked as if thePiri Reis map confirmed his suspicion that Plato had been right about an ancientcivilisation that predated known historical records.Hapgood was by then an assistant professor at Keene State College, part of theUniversity of New Hampshire. He again enlisted the aid of his students in hislatest enterprise. Their business was simply to study the Piri Reis map withoutpreconceptions and compare it with other early maps. One of the first thingsthey discovered was that the land maps of the period were extremely crude; oneshowed Italy joined to Spain, another showed England shaped like a teapot. Yetthe maps used by mariners – known as ‘portolans’, which means ‘port to port’ –were often incredibly accurate. According to Piri Reis, his map had been basedpartly on a map possessed by Columbus, although no one had succeeded in locatingthis. But perhaps he had used maps from the ancient library of Alexandria;Hapgood was inclined to believe that these had found their way to the greatlibrary in Constantinople, which then fell into the hands of the Turks when thecity was captured in 1453.As long ago as 1889, Adolf Erik Nordenskiold (1832–1901), another leading experton early maps, had also been convinced that the portolans were based on mapsthat dated back centuries before Christ. After ten Arctic expeditions,Nordenskiold became aware of the deplorable state of polar cartography. Heundertook a systematic reappraisal of all ancient maps, culminating in theFacsimile-Atlas (Stockholm, 1889), which is commonly regarded as an impetus forthe modern study of cartography. The great geographer and astronomer Ptolemy,who had been a librarian in Alexandria around 150 BC,had made maps that wereless accurate than the medieval portolans despite having the greatest library inthe world at his disposal. Was it likely that ordinary seamen could surpass thework of Ptolemy, unless they had other maps to guide them?In fact, the Piri Reis maps contained a number of errors – for example, he hadallowed the twenty maps he used to overlap, so that he had shown the AmazonRiver twice, although he had also left out a 900-mile stretch of coastline. Oneerror could be pinned down to the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes, who was bornabout 275 BC.He knew that in Syene, in Upper Egypt (close to the present Aswan),the sun was reflected in a certain deep well on the solstice, 21 June, so towersthere did not cast a shadow at that time. But in Alexandria, 500 miles duenorth, they did. He measured the length of the shadow of a tower in Alexandriaat midday on 21 June, and used this to calculate the angle of the sun’s rays.This was about 7 degrees, which is approximately one-fiftieth of 360. Since heknew the distance to Syene, this meant that 500 miles represented 7 degrees ofthe earth’s polar circumference, so it was easy to work out that 360 degreeswould be represented by 25,000 miles. The actual circumference around the polesis 24,821 miles, so this was an amazingly accurate calculation for 240 BC,whenmost people were not even aware the earth was round.Through a slight error, Eratosthenes had increased the diameter of the earth by4.5 degrees. If Hapgood allowed for that 4.5 degrees error, the Piri Reis mapbecame even more accurate, suggesting that it had been based on ancient Greek(and Egyptian) source maps.When Piri Reis made his map, the famous mapmaker Gerardus Mercator was only oneyear old, so his work predatedMercator’s method of ‘projecting’ the earth on to a flat surface and marking itwith latitude and longitude. Mapmakers used a simpler method, choosing some townas a centre, then drawing a circle round it that they divided into sixteenslices, like a cake. Then they drew squares inside the circle, and went onextending these outward, creating a kind of crude latitude and longitude – acomplicated method, but one that worked well enough. When Hapgood’s studentsstudied the Piri Reis map, they soon realised that its original ‘centre’ laysomewhere off the chart, to the east. Most of them guessed it would beAlexandria, but careful calculation revealed that the actual centre seemed to beSyene, the sacred centre of Upper Egypt, further support that they might havebeen dealing with an ancient map.When the mapmakers of Alexandria made their own maps, we may presume that theydid not sail off to look at South America and Antarctica but based them on otherolder maps. But how old were they?An interesting piece of evidence offers us one clue. Towards the end of thesecond century BC,the Greek grammarian Agatharchides of Cnidus, a tutor to oneof the Ptolemy kings of Egypt, was told that, according to ancient tradition,one side of the base of the Great Pyramid was precisely one-eighth of a minuteof a degree of the earth’s polar circumference19 (a minute is one-sixtieth of adegree). Each side of the Great Pyramid’s base is 756 feet, or just over 230metres, and if this is multiplied by 8, then by 60, then by 360, the result isjust under 40,000 kilometres, or just under 25,000 miles (in fact, 24,933 miles)– again, an amazingly accurate assessment of the polar circumference of theearth. In fact the height of the Great Pyramid, in addition to its base, is alsoin exact proportion to the size of the earth – that is, its apex is where theNorth Pole should be.The Great Pyramid was built by the pharaoh Cheops (Khufu) around 2,500 BC,so howcan the ancient Egyptians possibly have known the size of the earth? It ispossible that they might have understood that it was a sphere, for example, bynoting that the shadow of the earth on the moon during eclipses is curved, or byobserving that a ship gradually vanishes below the horizon as it sails away.What impressed Hapgood so much was the astonishing accuracy of the Piri Reismap, once the 4.5-degree error had been allowed for. He noted that, in 1541,savants in Mexico City set out to decide its exact longitude by timing twoeclipses of the moon, one in Mexico City and one in Toledo in Spain. Theircalculations were off by miles. The ancient maps, on the other hand, werefrequently accurate to within one half-degree of longitude – something Europeansdidn’t achieve until John Harrison invented the marine chronometer in theeighteenth century.Hapgood was also intrigued by a large island shown off the coast of SouthAmerica. Located at 5 degrees north on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, it seems to beabout 300 miles in diameter, yet it is certainly not there today. Moreover, theisland is also shown on the Reinel Chart of 1510, and on a map of 1737 by theFrench cartographer Philip Buache.Hapgood was naturally interested in other portolans, and in 1959 he wrote to askthe Library of Congress if they had any more. He was invited to come and see forhimself – when he arrived there at Thanksgiving, he was slightly embarrassed tofind hundreds of them laid out for his inspection. He spent several days lookingthrough the maps, and then, as he describes it, ‘I turned a page and sattransfixed.’ What he was looking at was a map made by Oronteus Finnaeus in 1531,showing Antarctica looking much as it does on a modern map. But it depicted thebays without the ice, rivers flowing to the sea, and even mountains that are nowburied under ice. Although the Oronteus map failed to show the Palmer Peninsula,which stretches between north-western Antarctica and the coast of Patagonia, inreality, there is no such peninsula – if the ice melted, there would only be anisland. In short, the original map had been made by someone who knew the wholeof Antarctica – inland, as well as the coast. That could mean either thatAntarctica had originally been mapped by sailors who had explored and mapped itinland, or that the original inhabitants of the continent had mapped it forthemselves. Whatever the case, it suggested that Antarctica had been mapped morethen 6,000 years ago.Other portolans were equally significant. The Dulcert Portolano of 1339 showsprecise knowledge of an area from Galway to the Don Basin in Russia. A TurkishHadji Ahmad map of 1559 shows the world from a northern projection, as ifhovering over the North Pole, and also seems to show Siberia and Alaska asjoined. Since this is a heart-shaped map, with Siberia in one dimple and Alaskain the other, this could simply reflect the fact that the mapmaker did not havespace to include the stretch of sea of the Bering Strait between the two.However, if there was no Bering Strait, the original map must have been mademore than 12,000 years ago, when Siberia and Alaska were joined by a land bridgeat this location. A 12,000-year-old map sounds unlikely, but everything Hapgoodwas uncovering seemed equally absurd. He began to understand why the portolanshad remained unexamined in the Library of Congress for decades – any scholar whohad taken a close look at them had probably shuddered and hastily closed thefolder.The map of Antarctica published by Philip Buache in 1737 showed the Antarcticcontinent divided into two islands – as we now know, it is below the ice. Howdid Buache know this? He must have been using maps even older than those used byOronteus Finnaeus and the creator of the Dulcert Portolano, which had used oldmaps that showed the inland sea frozen over.The map Hapgood found in Joseph Needham’s Science and Civilisation in China,20dating from 1137, was carved on stone; it was drawn over a grid of squares.Hapgood had made an interesting discovery about the Piri Reis map and variousothers that could be traced back to the time of the library at Alexandria. Theirdegree of latitude was shorter than their degree of longitude, because theoriginal mapmaker had used an oblong grid; a later mapmaker had mistakenlychanged this into a square grid, causing a ‘longitude error’. Since this samelongitude error was also present on the Chinese map, it looked as if itsoriginal also dated from a very long time ago. Hapgood came to the conclusion:‘Perhaps we have here evidence that our lost civilisation of five or tenthousands years ago extended its mapmaking here, as well as to the Americas andAntarctica.’Again, Hapgood noted that West Africa, as depicted by Piri Reis, seems to havean ample water supply – for example, lakes that do not now exist are depicted –and other ancient maps cited by Hapgood show lakes in the Sahara. Between 10,000and 6,000 years ago, the mistral - the north wind – was very wet, carryingmoisture from the melting glaciers of the Ice Age, so that the Sahara was greenand fertile. Since the Piri Reis map shows West Africa with lakes, it would seemthat the original map used by Piri Reis dated from that wet period.In Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings Hapgood built up his case until it becameirresistible. It is impossible to dismiss the book as a work of imaginativespeculation, for every page bears the marks of wide and patient scholarship. Yetthe conclusions of its final chapter, A Civilisation That Vanished’, would bebound to shock any scholar who took it seriously, for it sounds like the rawmaterial of a novel by H. Rider Haggard or Jules Verne:The evidence presented by ancient maps appears to suggest the existence inremote times, before the rise of any known cultures, of a true civilisation, ofan advanced kind, which either was localised in one area but had worldwidecommerce, or was, in a real sense, a worldwide culture. This culture, at leastin some respects, was more advanced than the civilisations of Greece and Rome.In geodesy, nautical science, and mapmaking, it was more advanced than any knownculture before the 18th century of the Christian era. It was only in the 18thcentury that we first developed a practical means of finding longitude. It wasin the 18th century that we first accurately measured the circumference of theearth. Not until the 19th century did we begin to send out ships for explorationinto the Arctic or Antarctic Seas and only then did we begin the exploration ofthe bottom of the Atlantic. These maps indicate that some ancient people did allthese things.21Asking how a great civilisation can vanish without trace, Hapgood enunciated abasic principle of exploration: that we find what we look for. The portolans hadbeen known for centuries. The Piri Reis map, discovered in the Topkapi Palace inIstanbul in 1929, had been discussed in the Library of Congress as early as the1930s, before interest suddenly revived in 1956. But no one had seen itssignificance – or, if anyone saw it, was courageous enough to raise thequestions that Hapgood asked.Then why did the publication of Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings not cause a majoracademic controversy in 1966? The answer must be, partly, that academia wasalready a little suspicious of Hapgood. In 1958, when Earth’s Shifting Crustfinally appeared in print, it was accepted for abridgement by one of America’smost popular weeklies, The Saturday Evening Post, which alone was enough toarouse the irritation – and envy – of academics. In his foreword to the lateredition, The Path of the Pole, in 1970, the geologist F. N. Earll tells how,after reading this abridgement, he looked for reviews in technical and academicjournals but found none. When the reaction finally came, says Earll, it ‘couldhardly be described as rational – hysterical would be a better description’. Oneacademic declared indignantly that Hapgood was not a geologist, while anothercited an authority who disagreed with the authorities Hapgood quoted and usedthat as a basis for condemning the whole book. In short, Hapgood was treatedwith fury and contempt for daring to write about geology.As a result, none of these professors were going to enter into discussion of abook that claimed to have discovered evidence for a civilisation predatinganything known to history. It was easier to ignore Hapgood.There was another reason that no one was prepared to take Hapgood seriously. In1960, a book called Le Matin des Magiciens, by Louis Pauwels and JacquesBergier, broke all bestseller records in France, and was translated into dozensof languages. Pauwels was a journalist, while Bergier was a physicist who wasalso interested in alchemy. Their book was a flamboyant and dazzling hotchpotchof alchemy, archaeology, magic, hermeticism and literary speculation, withchapters on Lovecraft, the Great Pyramid, Gurdjieff and Nazi occultism. One ofits major exhibits was the Piri Reis map, among other portolans. ‘Had they beentraced,’ asked the authors, ‘from observations made on board a flying machine orspace vessel of some kind? Notes taken by visitors from Beyond?’ As The Morningof the Magicians made its triumphal progress all over the world, the Piri Reismap became more widely associated with evidence for ‘ancient astronauts’.22Hapgood, who had spent ten years working on Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, couldhardly have had worse luck.In 1966, a Swiss hotel manager named Erich von Däniken, whose passion for travelhad been satisfied mainly in the world of books, devoted his nights to writing awork arguing that our earth has been visited by spacemen in the remote past. Theidea had been suggested four years earlier by a Russian astronomer called JosephShklovkii, in a book entitled Universe, Life, Mind, which was issued in Americain 1966, with additional material by astronomer Carl Sagan, under the titleIntelligent Life in the Universe.23 Däniken’s book consisted mainly ofassertions that monuments such as the pyramids, the statues of Easter Island andthe Mayan temples of Mexico were built by – or with the aid of – ancientastronauts.Published in Switzerland under the title Erinnerungen an die Zukunft (Memoriesof the Future) in March 1968, it quickly became a bestseller, as did the Englishand American editions, entitled Chariots of the Gods?.Scholars pointed out that the book was full of absurdities and inaccuracies.Däniken had managed to multiply the weight of the Great Pyramid by five, and hisassertion that the Egyptians did not possess ropes or wood for rollers waseasily contradicted by paintings on the walls of tombs and pyramids. His claimthat the statues of Easter Island could not have been carved out of ‘steel-hardvolcanic rock’ by stone tools was also disputed – Thor Heyerdahl did it in the1950s with a few natives of the island, using stone tools found in the quarries.Däniken asserted that Easter Island also lacked wood for rollers, apparentlyunaware that trees once grew there, before all the timber was used up. Of theNazca lines in Peru, Däniken claimed they were intended as runways forspaceships, ignoring the fact that they are merely scratched in the loose rocksof the surface. Whole books – and television documentaries – have been devotedto attacks on Däniken’s ‘evidence’, demonstrating that most of it is based onignorance of what the inhabitants of Egypt, Easter Island, Peru and other landscould actually have achieved.Early in the book, Däniken (like Pauwels and Bergier) introduced the Piri Reismap: ‘The latest studies of Professor Charles H. Hapgood… give us some moreshattering information. Comparisons with modern photographs of our globe takenfrom satellites showed that the originals of Piri Reis’s maps must have beenaerial photographs taken from a very great height. How can that be explained?’Hapgood, of course, had never said anything of the sort. The fact that Piri Reisfailed to feature a 900-mile stretch of South American coastline and repeatedanother stretch suggests that the map was not taken from an aerial photograph.Nevertheless, millions of people were left with the impression that Hapgood wasa supporter of von Däniken, and that he also believed the maps had been drawn by‘ancient astronauts’.Hapgood was less concerned than he might have been – he had more importantthings to occupy his mind. For several years he had been convinced that he hadfound the actual whereabouts of Atlantis, and that this might even lead him toabandon the academic world for the more active life of an explorer. On 5December 1958, he had written to his friend Ivan Sanderson to announce what hetermed ‘the most sensational discovery of our time’.In studying the Piri Reis map, Hapgood had, as we have seen, noted a mysteriousisland about 1,000 miles off the coast of Venezuela and the mouth of the OrinocoRiver. Hapgood had also found two more ancient maps showing the island24 andtestifying to its existence. There is no such land mass now, only two very smallislands known as the Rocks of St Peter and St Paul. Each about a quarter of amile long, they are located above the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and are the tips ofmountains that are now submerged. This, Hapgood was convinced, was all thatremained above the surface of Plato’s Atlantis – just where Plato hinted it was,in the mid-Atlantic. The size of this mysterious island – about 350 by 250 miles– sounded about correct. Plato also claimed that Atlantis had a great centralmountain, a holy mountain, which Hapgood was convinced was now the Rocks of StPeter and St Paul.Sanderson had advised Hapgood to avoid mentioning the word Atlantis’ in Maps ofthe Ancient Sea Kings in case he was labelled a crank, but the warning washardly necessary – Hapgood was too aware of the hostility of his critics to layhis head on the chopping block. Besides, the evidence should soon be availablefor everyone to see. All that was now needed, Hapgood assured Sanderson, was arich benefactor who would lend them a yacht and pay for underwater cameras thatwould survey the slopes of the mountain – where, according to Plato, thereshould be about $500 million worth of gold.In Atlantis: The Eighth Continent (1984),25 Charles Berlitz says that in 1963Hapgood approached the White House, hoping he could persuade President Kennedyto lend him an aircraft carrier to investigate the seabed under the Rocks of StPeter and St Paul. He quotes from Hapgood’s unpublished memoirs: ‘It wasfortunate that I had had previous contacts with the White House when I did someerrands for President Roosevelt during World War II… It was no problem to findsomeone close to the Kennedys in Massachusetts who could arrange a meeting forme with the President… We had mutual friends in the Democratic Party in Boston.’Hapgood worked out a scheme whereby planes would fly in increasingly widecircles over the Rocks of St Peter and St Paul; if anything was seen on the seabottom, it would be investigated with underwater cameras. He recognised thedanger: if the newspapers got hold of the story, it would become front-page newsand his own reputation would suffer; he therefore suggested that the searchshould be disguised as ‘just another oceanographic expedition’.By October 1963 the meeting with Kennedy was arranged – only to be frustrated byKennedy’s assassination in November. Undeterred, Hapgood went on to suggest thatNelson Rockefeller – who was a friend of Sanderson – might be interested. SinceSanderson had once met Walt Disney at a party, he might also be worthapproaching; the search for Atlantis would have made a marvellous live-actionfilm.But again, Hapgood was to be disappointed. For a decade he continued toconcentrate on writing and teaching. His friend Sanderson died in 1973, and inthat year Hapgood told a correspondent named Henriette Mertz that although heknew that the site of Atlantis ‘lay around the Rocks of St Peter and St Paul’,he was abandoning the quest and could only hope that others would follow up thetrail he had so laboriously laid.In October 1982, Hapgood wrote to a young correspondent called Rand Flem-Ath,26adding an amazing postscript to his life’s work on ancient civilisations. Aftertelling him that he was now preparing a third edition of Earth’s Shifting Crust,to be published in 1983, he went on to speak of his latest discoveries:‘Furthermore, there is evidence that the last displacement of the crust movedboth American continents southward about 30 degrees, and absolutely devastatedlife and civilisation on them, while climatic change was much less drastic inthe Old World, and more avenues of escape existed.’A shift of 30 degrees represented about 2,000 miles, a vast distance. If therehad been a great catastrophe that devastated life and civilisation, then surelyit must have happened more quickly than in the 5,000 years that Hapgood hadpreviously supposed?The next paragraph of the letter offered an even greater revelation:‘Furthermore, in recent exciting discoveries I believe I have convincingevidence of a whole cycle of civilisation in America and in Antarctica,suggesting advanced levels of science that may go back 100,000 years…’One hundred thousand years? Could that have been a mistake for 10,000 years? No– the rest of the long letter was typed immaculately, without even a minorerror. Hapgood obviously read it through carefully before putting it in theenvelope. But at that time the ancestor of modern man, Cro-Magnon man, was notbelieved to have appeared on earth until about 40,000 years ago (although thedate has since been pushed back beyond 200,000 years). Besides, Hapgood was nottalking about cavemen with clubs, but a ‘whole cycle’ of civilisation, whichincluded ‘advanced levels of science’.And in the next sentence he told Rand: A good deal of the evidence I have onthis will be included in the new edition of ESC [Earth’s Shifting Crust].’Hapgood was, admittedly, a maverick, but he would not have placed his wholereputation in jeopardy with some crank theory. He evidently felt that he hadfound evidence of science dating back 100,000 years, at a time when, accordingto 1982 palaeontology,* the most advanced human being on earth was Neanderthalman.Rand Flem-Ath replied immediately, asking for some hint of Hapgood’s reasons forthis amazing assertion. For weeks there was no reply, then his letter wasreturned, stamped ‘Deceased’.Hapgood’s last letter led Rand to his own quest for the origin of science andcivilisation, of which this book tells the story.*In 1982 anatomically modern humans were thought to be no older than 65,000years. Today many palaeontologists believe that modern humans may haveoriginated 200,000 years ago."},{"pageContent":"2THE BLUEPRINTIN THE SUMMER of 1976 a twenty-seven-year-old Canadian named Rand Flem-Ath (hehad changed his name from Fleming when he married Rose De’ath and they combinedtheir names) went for a job interview at the Greater Victoria public library inVictoria, which is at the southern tip of Vancouver Island, in British Columbia.He would not hear the result until the following Monday, so to take his mind offthe waiting over the weekend he decided to sketch out a screenplay. It was abouta group of aliens, marooned on the earth, who decide to hibernate. While he wasthinking about a suitable location, he heard a song by Donovan on the radiocalled ‘Hail Atlantis’. An idea came into his head, and he scrawled on hiswriting pad: Atlantis = Antarctica’. Since he knew nothing about Atlantis, hespent the rest of the day at the public library reading up on Plato’s lostcontinent beyond the Pillars of Hercules.By the time he heard that he had the job, he was so fascinated by his researchthat there was no question of giving it up. And one reason, oddly enough, washis name. When he was at school, the class had been given an assignment to writean essay on a famous person who shared their name. Doing research on his famousnamesake, Sir Alexander Fleming, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine,he learned how in 1924 Fleming had returned to his lab after a period away. Hefound that an unwashed culture dish in the sink was sprouting a mould that hadkilled off bacteria in the area around it. He tested the mould and discoveredthat it would destroy most bacteria – he had stumbled upon penicillin. Readingof his namesake’s breakthrough, Rand Fleming decided there and then that hewould never allow a coincidence to go uninvesti-gated – it could be the doorwayto discovery.Soon after beginning his job with the Greater Victoria public library, Randstumbled upon his own coincidence. In book after book about Atlantis, he cameacross the same map. It was drawn by the seventeenth-century Jesuit priestAthanasius Kircher, a polymath who was as famous in his own time as AlbertEinstein. In his Mundus Subterraneus (Subterranean World) of 1665, Kircherstated that it showed Atlantis, and that it was based on a map stolen fromancient Egypt by Roman invaders and found in the cellars of the Vatican. Forsome odd reason, Kircher put north at the bottom.Rand had been an enthusiastic map reader ever since he was seven, when hisfather, who was in the air force, drove him from Nova Scotia to Arizona and thenon to Los Angeles to see Disneyland. Rand was assigned the task of reading theroad maps; he enjoyed this job so much that, from then on, he always took overthe navigation on car journeys.The Athanasius Kircher map led him on to the study of ancient charts, and hesoon found Hapgood’s Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, with its subtitle Evidenceof Advanced Civilisation in the Ice Age, in the catalogue of his library.Hapgood’s book took his breath away. Here was a combination of his currentobsessions, ancient maps and ice.Flipping through the pages, he suddenly stumbled upon another significantcoincidence. He was looking at a map of Antarctica without the ice, and itlooked remarkably similar to[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_001_r1.jpg]In 1665 Athanasius Kircher published a map of Atlantis which he claimedoriginated in Egypt.

He turned the library’s globe upside-down, andcompared what he saw with Kircher’s map. There was certainly a closeresemblance. In a pamphlet called Introduction to Antarctica,1 issued by theNaval Support Force in Antarctica, he came upon a map of the world as seen fromAntarctica. Again, it was a revelation. It showed Antarctica as the navel of theworld, so to speak. Suddenly Plato’s words ‘the whole opposite continent’ tookon new meaning. For Antarctica was in the centre, and the continents were allaround it, looking like one land mass.In the West we naturally think of the map of the world from our point of view,with the Atlantic Ocean in the middle, as in the maps of our schooldays, dividedoff from the other[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_004_r1.jpg]Oceanographers believe that the earth has only one ocean. The unity of the‘World Ocean’ can be seen in this US naval projection with Antarctica in thecentre. Plato’s account of Atlantis tells of a lost island continent in the‘real ocean’.great ocean, the Pacific, by the American continent. Seen from Antarctica, theworld has only one great ocean, the ‘true ocean’, just as Plato said.Rand was so excited by his discovery that he wrote a paper about it, entitled‘Atlantis of the True Ocean’, and had it notarised. Its opening paragraphcontained the comment: ‘Viewed from a satellite perspective, the Earth has butone true ocean, and Antarctica is in its centre… The priest described thelocation of Atlantis from Atlantis.’Rand became obsessed by Atlantis; he now wonders how Rose could tolerate him. Hecomments: ‘I was a fanatic, as defined by Winston Churchill as someone who can’tchange his mind and won’t change the subject.’There was still one major obstacle to his identification of Atlantis withAntarctica. Every encyclopaedia he consulted said that Antarctica had been underthe ice for millions of years. Like Hapgood before him, Rand turned hisattention to the problem of what sort of catastrophe could destroy a wholecontinent in a day and a night.In the Laws,2 Plato had remarked that world agriculture had originated inhighland regions after some catastrophic flood had devastated all the lowlandareas. Rand noted that the Soviet botanist Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov (1887–1943)concluded that the world’s wild plants had eight centres of origin,3 all inmountain ranges, including Lake Titicaca, in the Andes. Another site is inThailand, exactly opposite Lake Titicaca, on the other side of the globe.Rand went on to study the catastrophe myths of many Native American tribes – theUte, the Kutenai, the Okanagan, the A’a’tam, the Cahto and the Cherokee, as wellas the Araucanians of Peru. All have legends of violent earthquakes, followed byfloods. Many declare that a change in the face of the sun made it look as if itwas splitting apart; there were dozens of flood myths too. It began to look toRand as if their sheer number pointed to some primeval catastrophe, ‘when thesky fell’.In April 1977 Rose gave Rand the National Atlas of Canada for his twenty-eighthbirthday. Here he encountered another anomaly that appeared to offer a clue. Amap of Ice Age North America showed that many islands in the far north, whereRand’s father had been stationed when Rand was twelve, had been ice-free duringthe Ice Age. How could that be?Rand tracked down a copy of Hapgood’s Earth’s Shifting Crust at the Universityof Victoria, in fact the second edition, retitled The Path of the Pole. And whenRand opened it, he found himself looking at the end paper with a map labelled‘Path of the North Pole’, showing no fewer than three different positions of thepole over the past 80,000 years – the Yukon, the Greenland Sea and Hudson Bay,the latter being the position it occupied until around 9,600 BC.Hapgood’s vastaccumulation of geological and geomagnetic evidence supported his views.The geographic or what are known as the true North and South Poles are measuredby the earth’s axis. However, the magnetic North and South Poles are measured bythe location of the highest intensity of the earth’s magnetic field. This isusually within the proximity of the true pole. Using the fact of this proximity,Hapgood had been able to calculate the position of the former poles by examiningtheir magnetic signatures written in cooling lava and rock in the past. As itflowed from the inner earth, the lava and the metals within it (especially iron)hardened into a position that pointed directly towards the magnetic pole. Thisprovided Hapgood with the data he needed to determine the location of theprevious poles.The main piece of data was very simple. Geologists could trace the extent of theprevious ice sheet by the marks it left behind, such as valleys carved byglaciers. We can picture the Arctic Circle as a circular piece of adhesiveplaster, with the[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_005_r1.jpg]Prior to 9,600 BC, the Arctic Circle was centred on Hudson Bay (60N 83W) and theAntarctic Circle was in the South Indian Ocean (60S 97E).North Pole as its centre. Before 10,000 BC,that plaster apparently reachedfurther down, so that its centre was in Hudson Bay and its southernmost edge wasas far south as Ohio. As Rand had noticed, the western edge of the plaster didnot extend to the west coast of Canada. Hapgood concluded: ‘Thus we are able tosay that warm conditions of the Arctic Archipelago of Canada persisted for theentire duration of the Wisconsin glaciation, from 40,000 years ago to theestablishment of modern conditions.’Hapgood presented evidence to demonstrate, in the same way, that the North Polemoved from the Yukon district to the Greenland Sea about 80,000 years ago, thenfrom the Greenland Sea to Hudson Bay about 50,000 years ago, and from Hudson Bayto its present position about 17,000 to 12,000 years ago. In other words, themost recent crustal movement began about 15,000 BC,and ended about 10,000 BC.These movements of the Pole were not gentle and steady, and as far as humanbeings were concerned this shift from Hudson Bay to its present positionprobably involved many shocks, some of them cataclysmic, such as the crustalmovement in the La Brea area of California around 11,000 BC,which killed off adozen species in twenty-five years.For the next four months, Rand read and reread The Path of the Pole, thrilled atthe wealth of corroboration that Antarctica might have been Atlantis. Then heco-wrote with Rose a paper on his discoveries, in which they stated:We believe that the account given in Plato’s Timaeus is an accurate southernhemispheric ‘global’ view of the earth as it did in fact appear 12,000 yearsago.Further, we believe that the previous Temperate Zone of Antarctica was capableof supporting human settlements prior to the earth crust displacement.We believe that the lost continent of Atlantis was our generally ignored lostisland continent of Antarctica.In addition, we believe that Atlantis was an advanced civilisation (possibly aWorld Culture) which possessed an accurate advanced geographic view of the totalplanet.4In July 1977, they sent this paper to Hapgood. The response they received wasenthusiastic: ‘I am astonished and delighted by your article which arrived heretoday. Believe it or not, it is the first truly scientific exploration of mywork that has ever been done. You have found evidence for crustal displacementthat I did not find.’5They were thrilled, not only by Hapgood’s typical warmth and generosity, but byhis acknowledgement that they were doing important work. Rand’s new evidenceconcerned the fact that in Antarctica the ice was thickest where there was leastsnowfall, which seemed absurd, since snow turns into ice. Equally odd was thefact that the ice was thinnest in areas with the heaviest snowfall. The mostobvious explanation was that the areas with the thickest ice had been within theAntarctic Circle thousands of years longer than the areas with the thinnest ice.In other words, Antarctica had slipped lower, and a part that had once beenoutside the Antarctic Circle was now located inside it.Rand had uncovered evidence of a massive floating ice sheet that once extendedfrom the Antarctic to the southern Indian Ocean. If such an ice sheet meltedquickly because it suddenly entered a warmer zone, the bottom would be severelydisturbed; in fact there was evidence in the scientific literature that that wasjust what had happened. When the continent of Antarctica, which had once beenfree of ice, slipped into the Antarctic Circle, it pushed a giant ice sheet – ofthe type that now covers the North Pole – up towards India on the other side ofthe globe. Rand found references to this ice sheet in two obscure papers tuckedaway in the journal Science,6 published since Hapgood’s Path of the Pole.Rand had made another important discovery that had eluded Hapgood: the work of aforgotten writer named William Fairfield Warren, the founder of BostonUniversity, who had first conjectured that worldwide myths of a falling sky anda lost paradise were memories of a great geological upheaval, although hesuggested that this original paradise was at the North Pole. Paradise Found: TheCradle of the Human Race at the North Pole (1885)7 is an immensely erudite work,obviously inspired by Donnelly’s Atlantis, citing evidence from Japanese andChinese literature and a vast array of ancient cultures: Persian, Egyptian,Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian and Greek.Rand also discovered the work of another forgotten scholar, the Indian BalGangadhar Tilak, who published studies of the earliest Indian sacred texts, theVedas. Tilak, inspired by Warren, wrote The Arctic Home in the Vedas (1903).8 Hehad found evidence for Warren’s arctic paradise in the scriptures of ancientIndia, as well as in the Persian Zendavesta, especially in the fact that theancient scriptures contain evidence of knowledge of polar conditions, includingthe length of the polar day and night. The unknown authors of the Vedic hymnsappeared to be familiar with the geography of the polar regions.Rand pointed out that if Tilak had not been so influenced by Warren’sinterpretation of Vedic literature, which placed north at the centre of theearth, he would have seen that the Antarctic was a far likelier home for hisisland paradise. Hapgood had pointed out, in any case, that the North Pole icecap dated back at least 50,000 years, which was an unlikely time for the islandparadise to have evolved, whereas the Antarctic ice sheet dates back only 10,000or 15,000 years. (Rand was mildly irritated when Hapgood used his argumentsabout Warren and Tilak in the second edition of Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings in1979 without acknowledgement.)9As delighted as they were with Hapgood’s warm encouragement, the Flem-Aths werepuzzled that he failed to react to the suggestion that Atlantis was Antarctica.If someone had taken the trouble to map the interior of Antarctica when it wasdivided into two islands, the people most likely to be responsible were, surely,its inhabitants? It was not until 1995, when Rand was investigating the Hapgoodarchives at Yale, that he realised that Hapgood thought he had alreadydiscovered Atlantis much further north, in the Rocks of St Peter and St Paul.Rand’s own view, however, was that Hapgood was mistaken. It was true that themysterious island on the Piri Reis map looked about 250 by 350 miles, and thataccording to Plato the plain behind the city of Atlantis was about 229 by 343miles,* but Plato also explained that the continent of Atlantis was as big asLibya and Asia (approximately North Africa and the Middle East) put together,the mountainous part of Atlantis being far greater than the plain. There is nosign of a continent as large as that beneath the Atlantic.Encouraged by Hapgood as Hapgood had been by Einstein, Rand and Rose began workon a book called Atlantis At Last!, which summarised the results of hisresearch. It was finished in 1980. They began to look for a publisher and Randcontinued to develop his own theories about ‘when the sky fell’.In 1981 Rand and Rose (who had been born in England) moved to London, where Randwas able to use the facilities of the British Museum Reading Room to continuehis research on Atlantis. To support themselves, Rose found work as a temp,while he found work at the Conoco oil company.The job suited Rand; he was in daily contact with geologists and geophysicists,for it was his responsibility to provide them with maps of the North Sea bed,along with available geological evidence, in preparation for a governmentannouncement about North Sea oil exploration. The information Rand was gatheringwould enable the company to decide which areas to bid for. He led a team of fivepeople, and his skills in map-reading served him well. He also enjoyeddiscussing Hapgood’s shifting crust theory with professional geologists, and waspleased to find that so many were open-minded about it. All his spare time wasspent in the British Museum. They found a publisher for Atlantis at Last!, butunfortunately it went out of business before publication. However, Rand’s daysin the Reading Room were providing so much fascinating information thatpublication undoubtedly would have been premature and would have led to a senseof anticlimax. He worked on with an increasing excitement as new discoveriesstrengthened his certainty that Hapgood’s theory of earth’s shifting crust wassound.What continued to puzzle him was why Hapgood continued to be ignored by earthscientists, even though his arguments for ‘the path of the pole’ were backedwith such a mass of scientific evidence and scientific acceptance of the theoryof plate teton-ics had made his crust displacement theory far lesscontroversial. While following up some remarks by Hapgood on the origins ofagriculture, he stumbled upon a possible explanation in a book called TheStructure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas S. Kuhn. Its arguments had madeKuhn famous – or infamous – in the scientific community when it appeared in1962: Kuhn had proposed that scientists are mistaken to think of the pursuit ofscience as a detached and unemotional activity. Once they have becomecomfortably settled with a certain theory – Kuhn preferred to use the word‘paradigm’ – they develop an emotional attachment to it, like a mother with ababy, and if anyone challenges it they become defensive, remaining totallyconvinced that their irritation is the annoyance of a reasonable man in the faceof time-wasting absurdities. This is why the great scientific revolutions – ofCopernicus, Newton, Einstein and quantum theory – encountered such furiousresistance. Even into the 1960s, the eminent British geophysicist Sir HaroldJeffreys maintained that the earth’s crust is immovable in spite of the evidenceof plate tetonics. Kuhn pointed out that the proof required to budge suchentrenched opinion is enormous – facts stand no chance in the face of a lifetimeof believing in the same theory.Now working for a group called Business International, a consulting firmspecialising in providing research for corporate executives, Rand encountered aninstructive – and amusing example – of this. He became a friend of one of Kuhn’sgraduate students, and on many occasions the two of them discussed Hapgood’sshifting crust theory, with Rand explaining how it could account for the originsof agriculture, extinctions and glaciation patterns. After several months,Kuhn’s student was in total agreement that Hapgood’s crust displacement was agood example of Kuhn’s ‘paradigm shifts’ and the kind of hostility theyencounter, until one day, when Rand admitted that his interest in the subjecthad been triggered by Plato’s account of Atlantis. Suddenly Kuhn’s studentrefused to discuss earth crust displacement any more.Concerned that increasing commitments to their careers might prevent them fromdedicating their energies to developing their ideas about Atlantis, Rand andRose decided to return to Victoria to work on the book. The four years in Londonhad been of immense importance to the development of Rand’s theory. AfterHapgood’s death in 1982 – which shook Rand badly – Rand felt that he hadinherited the problems that Hapgood had left unsolved.The main one, of course, was what actually caused the crust to shift. In ThePath of the Pole Hapgood had come to agree with Einstein that the answer was notthe ‘washing machine’ effect, whereby an irregular polar ice cap caused theearth to ‘judder’, but he had accumulated a vast amount of other evidence thatthe crust does shift. Rand was inclined to believe that Milankovich’s hypothesisabout ice ages was right, agreeing that they occur when three factors – tilt,perihelion and eccentricity – coincide. He concluded that the main factor wasthe earth’s 41,000-year tilt cycle.11Rand and Rose wrote When the Sky Fell, and began to submit it to publishers.Perhaps he might have been better off retaining the old title Atlantis at Last!.If Rand had suggested that the ancient maps proved that the earth had beenvisited by extraterrestrials from another galaxy, the book would probably havebeen accepted by the first publisher who read it, but a sober study on earthcrust displacement, with an appendix on the origins of agriculture, seemed tolack bestseller potential, even if it did argue that Atlantis was in Antarctica.Hapgood was forgotten and his works had fallen out of print; why bother torevive them? One publisher found it ‘fascinating but too academic’, and another‘intriguing but too academic’, while a third said it left him breathless but hecouldn’t figure out what audience they had in mind. Finally, the Flem-Athsaccepted that the book would never be published.A decade passed, during which Rand and Rose moved to Vancouver Island. Apublisher had not been found for the Atlantis book, but Rand continued to readthe scientific literature on archaeology, mammal extinctions and anything elsethat had a bearing on his quest for Atlantis. Although he was unaware of it, theclimate was gradually becoming more favourable for his book. The breakthroughcame when John Anthony West read the manuscript and agreed to write anafterword.West was an Egyptologist, although he would certainly not have been recognisedas such by the archaeological establishment. To begin with, he was fascinated bythe work of a man who was unmentionable in Egyptological circles: René Schwallerde Lubicz. Schwaller (the ‘de Lubicz’ was bestowed later by a Lithuanian princeof his acquaintance) was the son of a well-to-do Alsatian pharmacist; he went toParis in his twenties to study painting under Matisse, but soon moved into thestudy of theosophy and alchemy. He founded an ‘esoteric school’ called Suhalianear St Moritz, in Switzerland; after it broke up in 1929, he and his wife Ishamoved to a large country mansion in Grasse, in the south of France, then in 1937to Egypt, where he became fascinated by the temple of Luxor.Schwaller came to believe that the Egyptians possessed a mode of thought thatthe modern world is almost incapable of grasping. In Alexandria he visited thetomb of Rameses IX, where he was fascinated by a painting that showed aright-angled triangle in which the hypotenuse was formed by the body of thepharaoh. The sides of the triangle formed the ratio 3:4:5, in other words, thetriangle with which every schoolchild is taught Pythagoras’s theorem that thesquare on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other twosides. Schwaller was intrigued, since Rameses IX ruled around 1,100 BC,more than500 years before Pythagoras. Since Schwaller had spent many years studying thearchitecture of the cathedrals of the Middle Ages, he was familiar with thestory that the knowledge of the medieval masons came from ancient Egypt. Hebegan a systematic study of Egyptian temples, and of Luxor in particular.The first thing that strikes the tourist who looks at his map of Luxor is thatthe temple is ‘bent’, as if the courtyard that lies inside the entrance has beenknocked slightly sideways by a blow from a giant mallet. Since the Egyptianswere master builders, who could place blocks together so precisely that a razorblade cannot be inserted between them, there is obviously a reason for thisanomaly. The marvellous harmony of the architecture leaves little doubt that itis part of some geometrical plan.Schwaller set out to solve the riddle. The outcome was his masterwork, TheTemple of Man (1957),12 demonstrating that the Luxor temple is of immensegeometrical complexity, and that it is a symbolic representation of a man – akind of gigantic hieroglyph. Because the man is striding forward, like thestriding colossus of Rameses II in its south-east corner, the courtyardrepresenting the lower part of the leg has the shape of a square knockedsideways.One of Schwaller’s main insights was that the temple also contains many examplesof the geometrical proportion known as the ‘Golden Section’ (and called by theGreek letter phi). It sounds like an obscure definition from a geometry book,but it is a notion of profound importance, and it also plays a central part inthe precise location of sacred sites.[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_006_r1.jpg]Nature uses the Golden Section all the time. Your body is an example, with yournavel acting as the division between the two parts. It can be found in thespirals of leaf arrangements, petals around the edge of a flower, leaves arounda stem, pine cones, seeds in a sunflower head, seashells – even in the arms ofspiral nebulae. Why is nature so fond of it? Because it is the best way ofpacking, of minimising wasted space. Artists also discovered it at a fairlyearly stage, because this way of dividing a picture is oddly pleasing to theeye, in exactly the same way that musical harmonies are pleasant to the ear.Obviously, there is something very important about this simple-looking number.It is, in fact, 0.618034…, going on to infinity, non-recurring, as some decimalsdo.Another form of phi is 1.618. If you wish to extend a line a phi distance, yousimply multiply it by 1.618.Another piece of mathematics is significant: a sequence of numbers discovered bythe mathematician Fibonacci, in which each number is the sum of the precedingtwo numbers. If you begin with 0 and the next number is 1, 0 + 1 equals 1. Andthat 1 plus the previous 1 equals 2. And that 2 plus the preceding 1 equals 3.And so on: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55…If you take any two Fibonacci numbers, and divide each one by the one before it,the answer gets closer and closer to the Golden Number 0.618034… the bigger thenumbers concerned. No matter how big the numbers become – even billions ortrillions – the number never quite reaches the Golden Number.These Fibonacci numbers can be found in pine cones, nautilus shells and spiralnebulae.This is what excited Schwaller so much when he detected it in the Luxor temple.He had spent his years in Switzerland studying the laws of universal harmony, asepitomised in cathedrals such as Chartres. His results had been stolen by analchemist called Fulcanelli, who had published them as his own in 1925 in a bookcalled The Mystery of Cathedrals,13 which quickly became a classic. Schwallerhad no doubt that this law of harmony was a part of a far older tradition thatwas already well established by the time of ancient Egypt. When his firstresults were published in 1949 in The Temple in Man, they caused an intellectualfurore of the kind that the French enjoy so much, and Schwaller became brieflyas famous as contemporaries like Sartre and Camus. (It did not last – the publicsoon tired of Egyptian geometry.)Schwaller believed that this tradition predated ancient Egypt because during hisfirst visit to the Sphinx he had no doubt whatever that it had not been erodedby wind-blown sand, but by water. This suggested that it dated back long before2,500 BC,the usual date assigned to the pyramids of Giza. Schwaller was familiarwith an occult tradition that the Sphinx was not built by ancient Egyptians, butby survivors from the civilisation of Atlantis, who had fled some time beforethe final catastrophe. In his last book, Sacred Science,14 he spoke of anAtlantean race, ‘ancient vestiges of which have now been determined in westernAfrica; a wave of these people, having crossed Saharan Africa, finally settledin the valley of the Nile’. The true date of the construction of the Sphinx mustbe some time around 10,000 BC.Schwaller died at Grasse in 1961, at the age of seventy-four. Although his bookssoon went out of print, a copy of Sacred Science fell into the hands of astudent of Egyptology called John Anthony West. West was convinced that it wasabsurd to believe that ancient Egypt had come into being about 3,100 BC– thedate accepted by most Egyptologists – and that a mere five centuries later itwas already building the pyramids. That, he felt, would be like asking us tobelieve that Europeans had no civilisation until five centuries before ChartresCathedral. The more West learned of Egyptian science, medicine, mathematics andastronomy, the more it seemed to him obvious that Egyptian civilisation was far,far older than Egyptologists usually believe.As he read Sacred Science, he realised there might be a simple way to provethis. If the Sphinx and its enclosure had been eroded by rain, not by wind-blownsand, a good geologist ought to be able to tell at a glance. He discussed theproblem in a strange book called Serpent in the Sky15 – strange because itspends most of its time discussing Schwaller de Lubicz, Egyptian geometry andthe Golden Section. The book was sent to me for review in July 1979, and I wasnaturally most impressed by its final chapter, ‘Egypt: Heir to Atlantis’, withits photographs comparing the Sphinx enclosure with the cliff face behind thetemple of Queen Hatshepsut, with erosion in both places that geologists agree tobe water weathering. To me they certainly looked remarkably similar.It took West many years to find an open-minded geologist who could command therespect of his colleagues. Eventually, accompanied by Boston Universitygeologist Robert Schoch, West made the trip to Cairo. As they stood before theSphinx enclosure, he was understandably nervous, half expectingSchoch to point out that he had made some elementary error and that the erosionwas caused by sand. To his relief, Schoch took one look and agreed that this waswater weathering.The difference is easy to explain. When a rock face is blasted by wind-blownsand, its soft layers are worn away while its hard layers continue to jut out,so the profile of the rock looks like a layer cake or a club sandwich. When arock face is eroded by rainfall, the soft layers are still worn awayhorizontally, but the rain also cuts vertical channels, so the profile of therock is a little like a series of babies’ bottoms, with rounded curves. Suchweathering could be seen on the Sphinx and the Sphinx enclosure.In Schoch’s opinion the Sphinx might well have been built around 7,000 BCwhichwould make it 9,000 years old instead of 4,500. When he announced this result tofellow geologists at a conference of the Geological Society of America inOctober 1991, it aroused intense controversy, although – strangely enough – manyof the geologists were inclined to agree. It was the Egyptologists among themwho denounced Schoch’s views as pure fantasy.West also persuaded a senior forensic artist, Frank Domingo of the New YorkPolice Department, to examine the battered face of the Sphinx, and assesswhether it might be that of the pharaoh Chefren, whose bust had been foundburied in the Valley Temple facing the Sphinx. Domingo went to Cairo and appliedto the Sphinx the same methods he would employ in trying to identify the damagedface of a corpse from a photograph. His conclusion was that the Sphinx wasemphatically not Chefren – the chin was more prominent, the mouth a differentshape, and the cheeks sloped at a different angle.West published an article about the findings in a glossy magazine and sent me acopy. It so happened that I had been asked to write a film outline aboutAtlantis for a Hollywood producer, and had used West’s theory that the Sphinxhad been built by survivors from Atlantis. We met in New York inSeptember 1993, and he showed me the rough cut of a television documentary hehad made about the Sphinx. When I told him that I was thinking of writing a bookabout the whole question of the Sphinx and the age of civilisation, herecommended that I contact two other writers who were working along the samelines. One was an economics journalist named Graham Hancock, who had written abook called The Sign and the Seal,16 about the Ark of the Covenant, and was nowwriting a book arguing that civilisation may be many thousands of years olderthan historians believe. The other was a Canadian librarian called RandFlem-Ath, who had written a book about Atlantis that was still in typescript. Imade a note of both their addresses.How had John West come to hear about Rand and When the Sky Fell? By anothercoincidence. In March 1993, Rand read a copy of a magazine called SaturdayNight, which contained an article about the Sphinx by Paul Roberts,17 a writeron Eastern philosophy, telling the story of John West and Robert Schoch anddescribing West’s suspicion that the Sphinx may have been built by survivors ofAtlantis. Rand wrote to Paul Roberts, enclosing an outline of When the Sky Fell.To his delight, Roberts replied a few days later by fax, expressing hiswillingness to read the entire book. Paul Roberts sent the outline on to his oldfriend John West, and also suggested a Canadian publisher.When I returned to England in late September 1993, I lost no time in writing toRand and to Graham Hancock. Within little more than a week, I had receivedtypescripts of When the Sky Fell, and of a book called Fingerprints of theGods.18Hancock’s typescript was vast. He was not, like Däniken, arguing that spacevisitors were responsible for civilisation but simply proposing that our humanancestors – who built Tiahuanaco in the Andes and the pyramids of Mexico andEgypt – were far more technically accomplished than had ever been acknowledged.He cited astronomical evidence by the Bolivian scholar Arthur Posnansky, who hadspent a lifetime studying the ruins of Tiahuanaco, that the ‘temple’ (orKalasasiya) had been built about 15,000 BC,some 9,000 years before the latestestimates of the beginning of civilisation in the Middle East.Hancock also drew on the work of a Belgian engineer, Robert Bauval, presented ina book called The Orion Mystery.19 Bauval had seen a photograph of the threepyramids at Giza taken from the air, and had been struck by their rather oddarrangement. The first two pyramids – the Great Pyramid of Cheops (Khufu), andthe pyramid of his son Chefren – were neatly arranged so that a diagonal couldbe drawn from the upper left-hand corner of the Great Pyramid, straight throughthe opposite corner, and then on through the same two corners of the Chefrenpyramid. You would expect that line to continue on through the two corners ofthe smallest of the three pyramids, that of Menkaura. So why was the thirdpyramid completely out of alignment? And why was it so small, compared to theother two? Menkaura was as powerful a pharaoh as his father and grandfather.The answer came to Bauval when he was in the desert one night, and saw the threestars of Orion’s Belt – Orion looks like two triangles placed point to point,and the Belt runs across its middle. The three stars were arranged exactly likethe three pyramids. Moreover, the Milky Way, stretching across the sky besidethem, looked very much like the Nile running north past the pyramids. Bauvalknew that the Egyptians regarded their land as a reflection of heaven. Did theymean that quite literally, building the pyramids to reflect the Belt of theirsacred constellation of Orion, which represented the god Osiris?However if the pyramids were meant as a representation of the stars of Orion’sBelt, Bauval noticed that they were not quite an exact reflection. Because of aphenomenon called the precession of the equinoxes, the constellation moves upand down the sky over a period of about 26,000 years. As it does so, it twistsslightly – imagine that the double-triangle is impaled on the end of the minutehand of a clock, and you can see that as it moves from twelve o’clock to halfpast twelve, it will turn completely upside down. Actually, precession causesthe constellation to move only to about ten past twelve, but it still changesits angle. Bauval calculated that the last time Orion actually ‘reflected’ thepyramids of Giza, as if reflected in a vast mirror, was about 10,500 BC.Bauval felt that this date must have had some deep significance for the ancientEgyptians – in fact, it was what their holy scriptures referred to as the ‘FirstTime’, zep tepi, the beginning of Egyptian history. Was the Sphinx built tocommemorate that ‘First Time’ around 10,500 BC?If Bauval was correct, theSphinx’s construction predated Schoch’s estimate of 7,000 BC.Bauval did not think that the pyramids were also built in 10,500 BC– he thoughtthat certain astronomical evidence concerning the ‘air shaft’ out of the Queen’sChamber indicated that the Great Pyramid had actually been built around 2,500BC,just as Egyptologists believe, but he felt the whole Giza complex was almostcertainly planned in 10,500 BC.In Fingerprints of the Gods, Graham Hancocksuggests that perhaps the lower part of the Chefren pyramid had been built in10,500 BC,since its massive blocks are quite unlike the much smaller blocks ofthe other two pyramids.Graham Hancock was immensely helpful to me when I began my own book, which waseventually published as From Atlantis to the Sphinx.20 Graham sent me twocomplete versions of the typescript of Fingerprints of the Gods, and the nextyear the typescript of the sequel on which he and Robert Bauval collaborated,Keeper of Genesis,21 with an invitation to use anything I wanted.Rand had also played his part in the success of Fingerprints of the Gods. Grahamhas described how, when he was finishing Fingerprints of the Gods, he was at alow ebb physically and mentally – physically because of months of travel,mentally because he was beginning to doubt his own findings about a lostcivilisation that preceded ancient Egypt and Sumeria. His researcher added tohis problems by resigning, explaining that there was simply no place on earthwhere the remains of such a lost civilisation could be concealed. It wascertainly not at the bottom of the Atlantic, where there was no evidencewhatever of a sunken land mass.At that moment Graham received a letter from Rand, who had been given hisaddress by Paul Roberts. The enclosed outline of When the Sky Fell solved hisproblem, while the various maps he had studied – those of Piri Reis, PhilipBuache, Oronteus Finnaeus – now all fell into place, like the missing pieces ofa jigsaw puzzle. Atlantis had to be situated in Antarctica. With that singlerecognition, Graham tied up all his loose ends.Also in When the Sky Fell Rand suggested that the language of the Aymara, wholive around Lake Titicaca, has a structure that is so logical that it can bewritten in an algebraic shorthand that computers can understand; it cantherefore be used as an intermediate language in enabling computers to translateother languages. Its structure is so simple that a Bolivian mathematician, Rojasde Guzman, suggests that it did not just evolve, but was constructed fromscratch.22That sounds like another argument for Erich von Däniken’s visitors from thestars, but neither the Flem-Aths nor Graham Hancock use it as such. They simplypoint out that legends of ‘gods’ exist all over Central and South America, andthat the gods come from the east. Their chief has a beard (Native Americans donot have beards) and looks like a European; he had many names in different partsof South America – Viracocha, Quetzalcoatl, Kon Tiki, Votan, Kukulcan – and heis known as the ‘god’ who brought civilisation and a moral code forbiddingslaughter. When he finally sailed away, he promised to return. In fact, theAztecs of Mexico mistook the invasion of the Spaniards for the return of thegods, which is why their empire was conquered so easily. Professor ArthurPosnansky concluded, from Aymara legends,23 that they believe that theirlanguage was that of the gods. Neither Graham Hancock nor the Flem-Aths assumethe existence of visitors from space to explain many of these ancient mysteries– the white gods from the east may have been fleeing from their owndisintegrating continent when they came to Mexico and South America.So in 1993, after years of disappointment in trying to find a publisher for Whenthe Sky Fell, the Flem-Aths suddenly began to sense that things were improving.I offered to write an introduction to the book, and it appeared in 1995, a yearbefore my own From Atlantis to the Sphinx and Bauval and Hancock’s Keeper ofGenesis.Keeper of Genesis aimed to explain why, if the ancient Egyptians (or Atlanteans)had made plans for the Giza pyramids in 10,500 BC,they waited another 8,000years to build them. The reason, according to Bauval and Hancock, wasceremonial. By 2,500 BC,the precession of the equinoxes had finally brought theconstellation of Orion (which represented Osiris) to a point in the heavens thatreflected the Giza plateau – the place of the ‘First Time’ – on the ground. TheEgyptians built the Great Pyramid and enacted an elaborate ceremony in whichOsiris arrived home in the pyramid, and then left for his home in the sky. It isa thesis that is bound to arouse a certain scepticism, rather like suggestingthat disciples who were present at Jesus’s crucifixion later planned to buildthe Vatican in AD8,000 in order to perform a ceremony symbolic of theResurrection, but it is certainly argued on the basis of immense astronomicalknowledge.When the Sky Fell was translated into nine languages. Rand soon found himselfembarking on a new project, linked to his previous work.In November 1993, shortly before When the Sky Fell had been accepted, John Westsent Rand an article by Robert Bauval that summarised the arguments that wouldappear in The Orion Mystery and Keeper of Genesis. Bauval had explained his viewthat the pyramids of Giza exactly mirrored the stars of Orion’s Belt mostrecently in 10,500 BC,at the beginning of the present ‘precessional cycle’, andhe argued that the Sphinx had been built at that date. Rand had dated the lastgreat crust shift at 9,600 BC.John West wanted to know how could Rand accountfor this discrepancy of 900 years?Rand replied that all the archaeological and geological evidence pointed to9,600 BCas the correct date. But Bauval’s argument did not imply that the Sphinxhad to have been built in 10,500 BC,simply that it memorialised that date. Thereis a memorial in Plymouth to the Pilgrim Fathers who sailed on the Mayflower,but it was not built in 1620.The question nevertheless continued to nag at Rand, just as the Atlantis problemhad nagged at him twenty years earlier, until a serendipitous event brought itinto sharper focus. Rose often brought home library books that she thought mightinterest Rand; one was Archaeoastronomy in Pre-Columbian America (1975) by DrAnthony Aveni.24 It provided a vital clue.The most important prehistoric monument in Mexico is undoubtedly the vastreligious complex of Teotihuacan, 20 miles north-east of Mexico City. At theheight of its prosperity, around AD600, it had extended for 12 square miles, acity larger than imperial Rome. Then, around AD750, there was a sudden and totalcollapse. Its cause is still unknown, although an earthquake seems probable,since large areas of the city were found to have burned to the ground.A 2-mile avenue, known as the Way of the Dead, runs through Teotihuacan fromnorth to south. At its northern end stands the pyramid of the moon, while theimmense pyramid of the sun lies off the avenue to the west.But, oddly enough, the Way of the Dead does not run exactly north–south – it was15.5 degrees off true north, pointing north-east. No one knows why. Onesuggestion was that the avenue was aligned on the setting of the Pleiades (orSeven Sisters), a constellation that was important in Meso-American mythology.Rand was excited to learn that there are no fewer than forty-nine other sacredsites in Mexico that are also misaligned to the north-east. As he studied theWay of the Dead, he was struck by an interesting suspicion. Was it conceivablethat when the holy site of Teotihuacan was first laid out, it did point to truenorth – at the old North Pole in Hudson Bay?At first sight, that seemed unlikely. The Hudson Bay Pole dated back before9,600 BC,and even outside estimates for Teotihuacan claim that it was founded noearlier than about 4,000 BC(the most widely accepted estimate amongarchaeologists is a mere 150 BC).Rand was also aware that most major religious sites are built on older religioussites, as if the ground itself is regarded as sacred. From Australia to NorthernEurope, from China and Japan to Canada, a sacred place remains sacred over themillennia. Many temples are built on the site of older temples. In the earlyseventh century AD,Pope Gregory the Great told Augustine, who ChristianisedEngland, to build Christian churches on pagan sites. The Dome of the Rock inJerusalem, one of Islam’s holiest places, is built on a Jewish holy site.Archaeology has uncovered the remains of five different cities at Tiahuanaco inthe Andes. If civilisation existed before 10,000 BC,as both Hapgood and theFlem-Aths believed, then it was likely that Teotihuacan had been a holy placefor thousands of years before 4,000 BC.Hapgood had stated that the longitude of the old North Pole in Hudson Bay wasabout 83 degrees west of our present Greenwich meridian (its latitude was 60degrees north). Teotihuacan is 98 degrees, 53 minutes west. On a map of theAmericas, it looked very much as if the Way of the Dead pointed straight at theHudson Bay Pole, but as a map is a projection of the globe on a flat surface, itmight therefore give the wrong impression. At all events, it looked as if theWay of the Dead was aligned on the old North Pole, and that was a vital firststep.What about the other forty-nine ‘misaligned’ Mexican sites?Rand examined four – Tula, Tenayucan, Xochicalco and Copan – and the resultswere always the same. The layout of all of the sites seemed to point within adegree of the old North Pole, as if they pointed at the old North Pole likesignposts.Aveni made one extremely interesting comment: ‘Many persist in believing thatwhat we’re really looking at are the remains of a mega-land survey undertaken bya vanished civilisation of Atlanteans.’ He obviously had in mind writers such asPeter Tompkins (author of Secrets of the Great Pyramid25 and Mysteries of theMexican Pyramids)26 and the British writer John Michell,27 who popularised theconcept of ‘ley lines’ – lines of earth-force – in the 1970s, but he had onlymentioned this idea to dismiss it. Like all academics Aveni would have regardedAtlantis as purely mythical, a happy hunting ground for cranks. Since bothHapgood and Rand were fairly certain that Atlantis – or some civilisation likeit – had actually existed, Aveni’s comment was certainly thought-provoking.Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that there had been some kind of sacredtemple at Teotihuacan before 10,000 BC,and that it was aligned on the old NorthPole. And let us also assume that the forty-nine other ‘misaligned’ sites inMexico were also aligned on the Hudson Bay Pole. If Hapgood is correct,Antarctica would have been perhaps 2,000 miles further north than it is today,and would have had a pleasant, temperate climate.The different locations under scrutiny suggest a civilisation that is spreadover a fairly wide area. Professor Posnansky thought that Tiahuanaco, in theAndes, had been a flourishing city around 10,000 BCand that it had been so since15,000 BC.We also seem to be looking at something like Hapgood’s notion of aworldwide maritime civilisation (he dated this around 7,000 BC,but we also knowthat he believed that Atlantis was destroyed in 9,600 BC).If such a civilisationexisted, then the idea of a ‘mega-land survey’ ceases to look absurd. Hapgood’s‘maps of the ancient sea kings’ implied something of the sort – maps that showedthe present Antarctica when it was free of ice.At this point, a website called ‘How Far Is It?’ enabled Rand to calculate theexact distance from any place on earth to any other spot. More importantly, italso showed the exact bearings from one to the other. Sadly the first result ofthis new tool was a major disappointment. When Rand used it to calculate theposition of Teotihuacan relative to the Hudson Bay Pole, he discovered that itdid not, after all, point at it like a signpost – it was at an angle of 11.6degrees rather than the 15.5 degrees he had been assuming. Rand pressed on withhis studies. The idea that the Mexican sites pointed to the old North Pole likedifferent signposts had not been proved, even though so many were aligned eastof north, but the website had given him another, and equally useful, tool –distance.All over the earth, 1 degree of latitude is equal to roughly 70 miles. (Degreesof longitude, by contrast, vary from 66 miles at the equator to inches at thepoles. Indeed, at the North or South Pole you can walk around all the earth’slongitudes in seconds.)Rand knew that the Great Pyramid revealed an extraordinary knowledge ofmathematics and geography. Its four sides are aligned exactly to the four pointsof the compass, and its site is exactly 30 degrees north of the equator –precisely one-third of the distance from the equator to the pole. Evidence thatthe Egyptians knew the length of the equator and its distance from the poles andthat the Pyramid itself is intended to represent half of the earth, from theequator to the North pole, indicates that the Egyptians of 2,500 BChad knowledgeof worldwide geography.Would the Great Pyramid, probably the most famous sacred site in the world,yield any evidence to support the theory that sacred sites were aligned on theold North Pole?Rand fed the Giza co-ordinates into the website, and discovered that, at thetime of the Hudson Bay Pole, Giza would have been 15 degrees further south(naturally, because the pole itself was further south). Rand now imagineddrawing a line from the Great Pyramid to the old North Pole, and another fromthe Great Pyramid to the present pole. He discovered that the angle between thetwo lines was 28 degrees – the number 28 seems to play a basic part in the Gizasite: there are 28 steps in the Grand Gallery that leads up to the King’sChamber, and the Sphinx Temple had 28 pillars. Moreover, in Keeper of Genesis,Bauval and Hancock had pointed out that, as seen from Giza, the solstice points(the positions where the sun comes up over the horizon during the longest day ofthe year and the shortest day of the year) are 56 degrees apart – that is, 28degrees between each solstice* and the equinox point.Rand’s most exciting discovery was that the Sphinx Temple had a 28-degreebearing from the mortuary temple of the Great Pyramid, and that if this bearingis extended it points literally like a signpost to the Hudson Bay Pole.It is worth noting that the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple, both standingin front of the Sphinx (and on either side), were built in a ‘megalithic’ stylefrom gigantic blocks, and that West, Hancock and Bauval have all argued thatthey date from a more remote early period. The same is true of the mortuarytemple of the Great Pyramid, which is why Rand looked for a connection.Concerned to verify the methods of his approach and to be sure his results werenot just the outcome of chance calculations, Rand looked carefully at othersites, concentrating on locations on the far side of the Atlantic, in the MiddleEast. Here he had no Professor Aveni to summarise the evidence conveniently, sohe had to piece together the evidence from site to site. It was slow work, butproved to be worthwhile. Just 1. Ur of the Chaldees. Its famous ziggurat and shrine to the moon goddess Nanna are oriented west of north. 2. Nippur, south of Baghdad, where the tablets of Gilgamesh were found, relating how the island paradise Dilmun was destroyed in a great flood. 3. The ziggurat and ‘White Temple’ of the Sumerian city of Uruk. 4. The Wailing Wall of Herod’s temple in Jerusalem, which pointed straight at the old North Pole.As in the case of Giza, what Rand also began to look for were the latitudes ofthe sacred sites. He soon came to note what he called ‘sacred latitudes’occurring again and again: any latitude that would divide neatly into 360degrees – such as the 30 degrees of Giza. Quito, the northern capital of theInca Empire, and Carthage, the Phoenician city, had both been at 30 degreesnorth during the Hudson Bay Pole. Others, such as Easter Island, Mohenjo-Daroand the Tibetan holy city of Lhasa, were located on the equator.When he had identified forty sites on ‘sacred latitudes’ Rand was fairly certainthat this was not just a game with numbers.Sacred latitudes when the Pole was at Hudson Bay (60N/83W). All of these sitesare within half a degree (30 nautical miles) of a sacred latitude. Raiatea andTahiti, in the South Pacific, are the closest land to the sacred latitude. * 50º Rosslyn/Loanhead/Kilwinning,Tara/Newgrange/Knowth, Dunecht, Uxmal, Chichen Itza * 45º Copan/Quirigua, Canterbury * 30º Carthage, Quito * 25º Troy, Constantinople * 15º Giza Pyramids, Jericho/Jerusalem, Ashur, Nazca,Gilgal, Heliopolis * 12º Babylon, Pyongyang * 10º Ur/Uruk/Eridu, Thebes/Luxor, Susa, Ise, Nara,Kyoto Heian, Kumasi, Naqada, Lagash * 5º Byblos, Xi’an, Lalibala, Elephantine, Raiatea, Tahiti * 0º Lhasa, Aguni, Mohenjo-Daro, Easter IslandNote: Sites connected by ‘/’ are located so close together that they yield thesame results.When the Sky Fell was published in Canada in January 1995, and was soontranslated into several languages. Graham Hancock’s Fingerprints of the Godscame out in April 1995, and its immense success made it clear that there was nowa worldwide audience for seriously researched books about ancient civilisations.My own From Atlantis to the Sphinx, dedicated to John West, Graham Hancock andRobert Bauval, appeared in May 1996, and sold out its first impression on theday of publication. Keeper of Genesis, by Robert Bauval and Graham Hancock,appeared in 1996, and was soon at the top of the bestseller list. The HiramKey28 by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas was equally successful.In due course, the television programme I had made with Rand was shown on theDiscovery Channel – it was called The Flood. While watching it early in 1998 Iwondered if Rand and Rose had seen it. The answer proved to be no – they had noteven known that it had been transmitted – so I made them a copy and airmailed itto Vancouver Island.Its arrival was again serendipitous. Rand had written an article about hissacred alignment theory, which was being published in a magazine called AtlantisRising. It concluded:I never thought to find another adventure to compare with my eighteen-yearsearch for Atlantis. But the unique placement of the earth’s most sacred siteshas emerged as a mystery that compels me with the same kind of fascination asthat journey. I hope to share this quest within the pages of a new book, Findingthe Future: Blueprints from Atlantis, which will lift the veil from theseancient sites to reveal concealed time capsules – messages, records and evenblueprints – from Atlantis.29But he had a problem. Rose was busy working on her second novel and, as afull-time librarian, Rand had even less free time. As they watched the tape ofThe Flood, Rand said, ‘I wonder if Colin might be interested?’ They both thoughtit unlikely, since they knew I was working on Alien Dawn,30 but Rand decided tofax me anyway, also sending the article he had written for Atlantis Rising.As I read it, I felt my scalp prickling. If his theory of sacred alignments wascorrect, then he had stumbled on the most powerful proof so far of apre-Atlantean civilisation. I lost no time in faxing back my acceptance. Afterthat, we transferred our correspondence to email, for it soon became clear thatthe vast amount of information he had accumulated would have to be sent in filesof a dozen or so pages at a time. Within less than two months I had more than200 pages.Most of this material was about sacred alignments. However, another line ofinvestigation produced some astonishing and almost unbelievable evidence ofHapgood’s ‘advanced levels of science’ long before the earliest knowncivilisations.*The figures Plato gives are 3,000 by 2,000 stadia (or stade), and a stadia (orstade) is roughly equivalent to an English furlong, about an eighth of a mile.*Solstices occur on the dates (22 December and 21 June) when the sun stopsrising further north or south every day, and turns back (at the Tropic of Canceror Capricorn) to retrace its route. as the Mexican sites are misaligned to theeast of the present North Pole (i.e., towards the old Hudson Bay Pole), so theMiddle Eastern sites were oriented to the west of it, again towards the HudsonBay Pole. These included:"},{"pageContent":"3THE GIZA PRIME MERIDIANIN OCTOBER 1884, Professor Charles Piazzi Smyth, the Astronomer Royal forScotland, was involved in a controversy on a matter dear to his heart:persuading a committee of experts from twenty-five countries of the world tomake the north–south line that ran through the Great Pyramid the prime meridianof the world, 0 degrees longitude.It may sound odd that, towards the end of the nineteenth century, when greatsteamships had been plying the oceans for decades, such a question should remainundecided. There had been numerous prime meridians – virtually one for everycountry that used the sea. Pope Alexander VI had decreed in 1493 that it shouldrun 100 leagues west of the Azores. Louis XIII of France supported a linethrough Fero in the Canaries. That was enough to make Charles II of Englanddecide to build the Greenwich Observatory, with the intention of designatingGreenwich as the prime meridian. The French disagreed, and then said it shouldrun through Paris. As other countries built observatories, most of them declaredtheir own capital the site of the prime meridian, which is why, inOctober 1884, twenty-five European countries gathered in Washington, DC, to makea final decision.Greenwich was high on the list of candidates because so many ships used the portof London, but Smyth was passionately opposed to it. In the Report of theCommittee on Standard Time and Prime Meridian,1 published in Cleveland, Ohio, inJune 1884, he argued that the Pyramid was the ideal choice because such ameridian would pass over more land than any other.The Great Pyramid, he pointed out, was acknowledged to be the grandest monumentever erected. As a further argument, he drew attention to its closeness toJerusalem, evoked the Second Coming of Christ, and asked whether every goodChristian would not agree that a Giza meridian would be ideal.The answer was no. The delegates were not at the conference as Christians but asscientists. Twenty-two of the twenty-five candidates voted for Greenwich – theFrench, of[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_007_r1.jpg]Astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth recognised that the Great Pyramid was located atthe centre of the earth’s land mass.course, abstaining. And so a thoroughly sensible and logical proposal wasrejected.In 1997, Rand was approached by a friend of John West, an airline pilot, whowanted to know if he had any information to suggest that Giza was the primemeridian – the pilot wanted to organise a Millennium rock concert at Giza, whichcould claim to have entered the new century two hours before London. When Randsent him the reference to Smyth it struck him that, since he had the latitudeand longitude of so many sacred sites, it would be a simple matter to add orsubtract Giza’s longitude (31 degrees, 8 minutes east) to see what would happenif Giza was the prime meridian instead of Greenwich. Suddenly dozens of sacredsites began to fit into a vast global pattern.Quite simply, sites whose latitude and longitude looked unpromising because theyseemed ‘too complicated’ (with too many decimals) now began to fall into simpleround figures.For example, Tiahuanaco, whose longitude is 69 degrees west of Greenwich, isalso 100 degrees west of the Great Pyramid. The former Inca capital at Quito isat 110 degrees west of Giza and other very significant sites, includingTeotihuacan and Easter Island, are found at 120, 130 and 140 degrees west of theGreat Pyramid. This pattern also extends eastward. Ur of the Chaldees is exactly15 degrees east of Giza and the Tibetan capital of Lhasa is 60 degrees east ofthe Great Pyramid.What was even more significant was the fact that many of these round figureswere phi numbers. Tiahuanaco, for example, was 10 phi; so was the ancientPolynesian spiritual centre Raiatea (this is also at 180 degrees latitude fromthe Giza meridian). Since I had described so many of them in my Atlas of SacredSites,2 I was as astounded and excited as Rand when he told me of hisbreakthrough.One of Rand’s most startling discoveries came shortly afterwards. He haddiscovered that there were no fewer than eight sacred sites at the 10 phi northlatitude during the Hudson Bay Pole.[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_008_r1.jpg]Pyramids and megaliths in America and Easter Island are linked to a Giza primemeridian.10 phi sites during the Hudson Bay Pole. 10 phi is 4429.2 nautical miles fromthe Pole, which is equal to 16:11N.Sacred Distance to HBP Former Site Co-ordinates (nautical miles) latitudeBaalbek 34:00N/36:12E 4,431 16:09N Paracas 13:50S/76:11W 4,431 16:09N Cuzco13:32S/71:57W 4,433 16:07N Sidon 33:32N/35:22E 4,437 16.03N Machu Picchu13:08S/72:30W 4,407 16:33N Ehdin 34:19N/35:57E 4,408 16:32N Ollantaytambo13:14S/72:17W 4,414 16:26N Nineveh 36:24N/43:08E 4,451 15:49NRand reasoned that there should be a current sacred site at 10 phi north tomatch Tiahuanaco’s 10 phi south, and that it should also be linked to the GreatPyramid. He had looked in his atlas for a very specific spot: 10 phi north ofthe equator, and 120 degrees west. There was nothing obvious – just three littlered dots, and a name that was so tiny that he had to take off his glasses toread it. He had never heard of it: Labaantum, in Belize in central America. Viathe Internet he had found out that ‘Lubaantum (Place of Fallen Stones)’ was anancient Mayan ceremonial centre with three pyramids and terraces made of dressedstone blocks.It turns out I could have told Rand about Lubaantum immediately, for I hadwritten an article about it in a book called Unsolved Mysteries Past and Present.3 Lubaantum will always be associated with the famous Crystal Skull, betterknown as the Skull of Doom, dating to about AD 700 and discovered in a Mayantemple by the adopted daughter of the explorer F. A. ‘Mike’ Mitchell-Hedges,Anna Mitchell-Hedges, on her seventeenth birthday in 1927.According to Anna, she had called her father after seeing something shiningunder an altar. With the help of locals (descendants of the Maya), they movedthe stones and saw that the shining object was the top part of a skull. Itproved to be a beautifully carved death’s head. Three months later, Anna foundthe missing lower jaw buried in rubble. The local Maya told Mitchell-Hedges thatthe skull had been an object of worship, and had been used for healing anddealing death to enemies. Mitchell-Hedges gave it back to the locals, but whenhe finally left, at the end of the rainy season, they returned it to him as amark of appreciation.There are two other rock crystal skulls in existence, but the ‘Skull of Doom’ isby far the most beautiful and perfect. With the rise of New Age thinking in the1960s, it became legendary, and many books have been devoted to it.Oddly enough, Mitchell-Hedges was curiously reticent about the skull in hisautobiography Danger My Ally.4 After claiming that it is at least 3,600 yearsold and took about 150 years to be polished, Mitchell-Hedges went on to say:‘How it came into my possession I have reason for not revealing.’Sadly, the reason was almost certainly that the Skull did not actually originatein Lubaantum. In the 1980s, an American investigator named Joe Nickell unearthedan article about crystal skulls in a journal called Man, which dated from 1936,including a description of a skull with a moving jaw that sounded very much likethe Skull of Doom. But it stated that this skull was in the possession of an artdealer named Sidney Burney, who had put it up for auction at Sotheby’s in 1943,but it had been withdrawn when the bids reached only £340. The records of theBritish Museum state that the skull was sold to Mitchell-Hedges for £400 in1944. Mitchell-Hedges, who died in 1959, at the age of seventy-one, was anadventurer rather than an explorer, and his books – with titles like Land ofWonder and Battles With Giant Fish – reflect the character of a man who was insome respects an overgrown schoolboy. His character was not above reproach – in1928 he lost a libel battle against the Daily Express, which had accused him ofhaving staged a fake robbery for the sake of publicity – so the Crystal Skullwas most likely not found in Lubaantum.In spite of the uncertainty that surrounds the events of its appearance in thetwentieth century, the skull is undoubtedly genuine. The rock crystal from whichit is carved probably came from Calaveras County, in California. A Californianart conservator named Frank Dorland, who was allowed to examine the skull for aperiod of six years, concluded that it might well have been over 12,000 yearsold. Nickell had objected that mechanical grinding of the teeth proved that itwas more recent, but a far less perfect crystal skull in the British Museum,also genuine, displays mechanical grinding of the teeth too. The laboratory ofthe Hewlett-Packard Company, which manufactures crystal oscillators, subjectedthe skull to laser-beam tests and concluded that it had been manufactured from asingle large crystal and polished over about 300 years, doublingMitchell-Hedges’s estimate. It had peculiar optical qualities, as if lenses hadbeen inserted inside it, although this is obviously impossible. Dorland claimedthat, when he kept it in his house overnight instead of returning it to thebank, there were poltergeist disturbances.If the skull was not found at Lubaantum, why should all this be relevant?Because Frank Dorland concluded that the skull originated in Mexico, and went onto point out that the native peoples there used a grinding wheel driven by astring stretched across a bow.An altogether more credible figure in South American exploration wasLieutenant-Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett, whose disappearance was one of themost widely publicised mysteries of the 1920s.During the last decade of his life, Fawcett was searching for a lost city in thejungles of Brazil. There is strong evidence that this mysterious city reallyexisted. In the National Library in Rio de Janeiro, Manuscript No. 512 gives anaccount of how, in 1753, a band of Portuguese treasure hunters spent ten yearswandering in the vast interior of Brazil, an area that is almost the size ofEurope.5 Coming upon a deserted city built of huge blocks of stone, they decidedto return to civilisation for reinforcements and sent an account of the city bynative runner to the Viceroy in Bahia. What happened to them then is unknown,and the manuscript lay forgotten in the archives for almost eighty years.This story actually goes back further, to 1516, twenty-four years after Columbusdiscovered America, when a Portuguese sailor named Diego Alvarez was the solesurvivor of a shipwreck close to the place where Bahia now stands. He was takencaptive by a cannibal tribe, the Tupinambas, but for some reason they spared hislife and allowed him to live among them. This may have been because of theinfluence of a local girl named Paraguassu, who became his wife (Fawcett refersto her as ‘the Pocahontas of South America’). More Portuguese arrived, and,through the good offices of Alvarez, they established a colony. Paraguassu’ssister also married a Portuguese, and it was her child, Melchior Dias Moreyra,who became known to the locals as Muribeca. He discovered silver mines andbecame a wealthy man, but he kept their location in the interior a secret.Regrettably his son, Roberio Dias, born to wealth, cherished an ambition tobecome a member of the aristocracy. In about 1610, Roberio approached the Kingof Portugal, Dom Pedro II, and offered to sell him the mines of Muribeca inexchange for a title of nobility – the Marquis of the Mines.6 The king agreed,but first he wanted to lay his hands on the silver mines.On his way back to Bahia, Dias discovered that the King had no intention ofkeeping his half of the bargain. When he persuaded an officer to let him see thesealed patent of nobility, he was infuriated to discover that the document wouldmerely confer the rank of captain in the army. Dias knew that he was in adangerous position. If he refused to hand over the silver mines, he would beimprisoned by the governor, Dom Francisco de Souza, a haughty aristocrat whodisliked being frustrated. So Dias played for time, and led the governor’sexpedition on a wild-goose chase. The governor, finally realising he had beenoutwitted, threw Dias into prison, where he remained for two years until hemanaged to buy his freedom. He died shortly thereafter, and the location of themines of Muribeca remained a secret.Many adventurers set off into the wilderness in search of the lost silver mines,and the government also sponsored expeditions called bandeiras, or ‘flags’, themembers of which were known as bandeiristas. In 1753, more than a century afterthe death of Roberio Dias, a group of six Portuguese bandeiristas set out on awell-equipped expedition with black slaves, native guides, and pack animals.They went inland, into the state of Minas Geraes, then made for the CentralPlateau. There they vanished for many years, but Manuscript No. 512 describestheir adventures in some detail. A full translation can be found in Mysteries ofAncient South America (1956) by Harold Wilkins.7After years of wandering, the party eventually encountered a cordillera(mountain chain) largely composed of a mineral whose crystals glittered in thesun. At close quarters, the mountains were seen to consist of bare rock, withwhite streams plunging from the heights. They seemed to be practicallyimpenetrable until one of the slaves saw a white deer that fled into a cleft.Pursuing it, he came across a road, which seemed to have been man-made. Hefetched the others, and soon they were all ascending it, dazzled by thecrystalline splendour of the mountains above them.At the summit of the pass, they were able to look down on an open plain, andthere, about 3 miles away, they saw a great city, so impressive that theyassumed it must be connected with the court of Brazil. Afraid that they had beenseen against the skyline and that the inhabitants might be hostile, theydescended as quickly as possible to the valley then decided to wait to see whatwould happen. After two days of silence, they sent one of the natives on ascouting expedition. He returned saying that he had seen no one, not even afootprint. The rest of the scouts then went ahead to investigate, and came backwith the same story. The city seemed to be uninhabited.At daybreak the next day, the whole party advanced cautiously and prepared foran ambush. The road led them to three great archways; the one in the centre, thetallest, had unknown letters engraved on it far above their heads. Beyond thearches was a wide road, with great houses whose facades were ‘blackened withage’. Everything was silent and deserted. There were broken pillars, withparasitic vegetation growing from the cracks, and the buildings were roofed withstone slabs. When the bandeiristas ventured inside the rooms, they found thatthe floors were covered with debris and bat droppings to a depth that suggestedthat these buildings had been abandoned many centuries ago.In the middle of the city they came to a vast square, in the centre of which wasa black stone column with a statue of a man who pointed towards the north.Carved obelisks of black stone stood at each corner of the square. On one sideof the plaza was a magnificent building, whose roof had partly collapsed. Ruinedsteps ran up to a wide hall, and the walls showed traces of coloured frescoes.This place was also full of bats, and the smell of their droppings made themcough.Beyond the main square, the city was a ruin, with mounds of earth and chasms inthe ground. It was obvious that this place had been devastated by an earthquake.The city was bounded by a deep and wide river, on the far side of which weregreen fields with many flowers. They could also see lakes with flocks of geese.They decided to follow the river downstream, and after three days came to a hugewaterfall, beyond which the river spread so wide that it ‘appeared to be a greatocean’. There were several tree-covered islands and an abundance of game. Theyalso saw big anacondas and poisonous snakes.To the east of the river they found great holes that could have been mineshafts, and one was covered with a huge flagstone with certain symbols carvedinto it. Near the ‘mines’ they found some abandoned bars of silver.There was also a ruined temple with more of the strange letters above itsportico, as well as the ruins of a ‘country house’. Looking inside, they found astairway built of coloured stone leading to a large hall, with rooms opening outfrom it. Each of these rooms contained the remains of a fountain.They continued downriver, and the narrator became convinced that they were inthe vicinity of rich mines – perhaps the legendary mines of Muribeca. A scoutingparty ventured on for nine days, and at a place where the river spread out sowide that it was like ‘a great bay’ they saw a canoe manned by ‘two whitepersons with long, flowing black hair, dressed like Europeans…’ When they fireda gunshot to attract attention, the canoers paddled off in the oppositedirection.The narrator mentioned that one of their company, a man called Joao Antonio,found a large gold coin with an image of a kneeling youth on one side. No doubt,he said, there were other such coins to be found under the rubble of the deadcity.The party decided that they had better make their way back to civilisation. Atthe Paraguassu River, the narrator wrote their story – and presumably sent anIndian messenger ahead with it. He concluded by begging the governor to keep itscontents secret, lest someone else should mount an expedition before they could.What happened to the group of Portuguese and their slaves and guides is unknown;all that we know is that the manuscript disappeared into the archives, becamepartly eaten by insects, and was found eventually by a Brazilian archivist in1841, almost a century after it had been written.8Harold Wilkins, a British author who wrote in a pleasantly old-fashioned stylebut whose books were excellently researched, obtained his transcript of thedocument in 1939 with the help of the American consul-general in Rio deJaneiro, W. G. Burdett. Colonel Fawcett had seen it at least twenty yearsearlier, and concluded that it was a truthful and accurate account.A reader’s first reaction to the tale of a journey to a lost city is that it isprobably fiction, but both Fawcett and Wilkins saw the manuscript, and thetravel writer Peter Fleming, who tried to follow in Fawcett’s footsteps (anddescribes it in Brazilian Adventure, 1933),9 quoted its archive reference, No.512.Percy Harrison Fawcett, born in Devon in 1867, joined the Royal Artillery and inhis twenties served at Trincomallee, in Ceylon, where he became interested inBuddhism and spent his leaves in a search for the lost treasure of the Kandyankings. On the whole Fawcett disliked the army, so when, in 1906, the Presidentof the Royal Geographical Society asked him how he felt about the idea of goingto Bolivia to map the north-eastern frontier, Fawcett accepted eagerly oncondition that the army would agree to lend him to the Bolivian government. Hisstory of these adventurous years was told in his posthumous book ExpeditionFawcett, edited by his son Brian.10 He described encounters with poisonousspiders, snakes, vampire bats, even wild bulls, which they were forced to kill.Searching for the source of the River Verde, the whole party ran out of food andstarved for twenty-three days. They were all close to death when a deer suddenlyappeared. Fawcett was so weak he could scarcely lift his rifle, but by what heregarded as a miracle he killed it. They ate the whole deer, including the furand skin.It was during this expedition that Fawcett tried to take a short cut overflat-topped hills covered with forest, but he was finally forced to return tothe valley. It was his story of this forest-covered plateau that inspired SirArthur Conan Doyle to write The Lost World. 11Fawcett returned to England to serve in Intelligence during the First World War,emerging with a Distinguished Service Order; then he went back to South America,hot on the trail of the lost city of the bandeiristas. In 1920 floods caused himto turn back from an expedition into the Matto Grosso (Great Forest) of Brazil.Fawcett had no doubt of the existence of Atlantis. Although he accepted that thecontinent had sunk beneath the waves, as Plato describes, he was convinced thatmany of the inhabitants had escaped to South America. He wrote in ExplorationFawcett:However much romance may have coloured the tales, the fact remains that thelegendary existence of a highly civilised remnant of an ancient people persistedamong the indigenes of the continent… There is a remarkable similarity in theaccounts, which makes it reasonable to conclude that there is a basis of truthin them.12Fawcett stated his belief – remarkable for that time – that ‘the curse of agreat cataclysm’13 fell on South America, and he seemed to accept that this wasthe catastrophe that destroyed Plato’s Atlantis. ‘There can be little doubt thata cataclysm of such dimensions produced tidal waves and minor catastrophesthroughout the world.’ It caused ‘the rising of the Andes’ and brought to SouthAmerica a people who were ‘expert in the arts of civilisation’. Fawcett’sconclusions were remarkably similar to those we have reached in this book.The survivors also built cities like the one discovered by the 1743 expedition.‘The existence of the old cities I do not for a moment doubt,’ says Fawcett.‘How could I? I myself have seen a portion of one of them – and that is why Iobserved that it was imperative for me to go again. The remains seemed to bethose of an outpost of one of the biggest cities…’14This raises an interesting question. Why does he seem unsure? It seems likelythat the rest of the city was completely covered by the jungle, like those lostMayan cities discovered by Stephens and Catherwood in the 1830s. This means, inturn, that Fawcett knew where to look for a lost city, although it emerges fromhis book that he thought there were many of them.He determined to go and find at least one of them, but his objective on thatlast expedition was not apparently the deserted city of 1753 discovered by thebandeiristas. He had heard of ‘clothed natives of European appearance’, whoavoided all contact with the outside world. ‘Our destination on the nextexpedition – I call it “Z” for the sake of convenience – is a city reputed to beinhabited, possibly by some of these timid people…’ This implies three differentcities: the deserted city of 1753, the city whose outskirts he observed, and‘Z’. No wonder Fawcett was determined to return to Brazil.He left England for South America once more, spending the years from 1921 to1924 raising the money for the expedition. When an American ‘fund-raiser’squandered most of this on a six-week orgy of drunkenness, Fawcett set to workagain, and finally had sufficient funds to continue.It was not to be an elaborate expedition; there was only Fawcett, histwenty-one-year-old son Jack and a young Devon friend of Jack called RaleighRimell. They had to be prepared to carry their equipment on their backs.The greatest danger would be after they had reached Cuyaba (now spelled Cuiaba),the capital of the Matto Grosso, by boat, then made their way north to theunknown region between the rivers Xingu and Araguaya. Fawcett believed ‘Z’ layto the east of this. In the manuscript later published by his son, Fawcett leftfairly exact directions: first of all, he explained, he wanted to visit anancient stone tower, to solve the mystery of why its doors and windows were litup at night, terrifying the local Indians.Beyond the Xingu we shall take to the forest at a point midway between thatriver and the Araguaya, and from there cross by an existing trail to the RioTocantins at Porto Nacional or ‘Pedro Alfonso’. Our way will lie betweenlatitude 10 degrees 30 minutes and 11 degrees to the high ground between thestates of Goyaz and Bahia, a region quite unknown and said to be infested bysavages, where I expect to get some trace of uninhabited cities. The mountainsthere are quite high. We shall then follow the mountains between Bahia andPiauhy to the River Sao Francisco, striking it somewhere near Chique-Chique, andif we are in fit condition to do so, visit the old deserted city [that of 1753]which lies approximately 11 degrees 30 minutes south and 42 degrees 30 minuteswest, thus completing the investigations and getting out at a point from whichthe railway will take us to Bahia City15Although Fawcett gave the precise latitude and longitude of the ‘deserted city’of the bandeiristas, his son Brian, in a footnote, added: ‘I have personallyinvestigated the bearings he gives for the 1753 city, and can stateauthoritatively that it is not there.’16 It would seem that, for whateverreason, Fawcett gave the wrong co-ordinates – an odd mistake for a man who wasso meticulous.By 20 May 1925 they had reached the village of the Bacairy, north of Cuiabo.17They were still experiencing inconvenience rather than danger – the man who hadsold them mules had cheated them, and Jack’s leg had swelled with a tick bite,so they had to stay at the farm of a friend to recover. The chief of the Bacairytold them that he had always hoped to make the journey to the ‘great waterfall’.Then, after staying in a village of the Nafqua – where Fawcett had in 1920presented the chief with a uniform case18 – they went by river to a village ofthe Kalapalo on the River Kuluene. And there, on 29 May 1925, their trail comesto an end. The Kalapalo later claimed that Fawcett’s party had struck out acrosscountry to the east, and that the smoke of their camp fires had been visible forfive days, but in 1951 the chief of the Kalapalo, Izarari, made a deathbedconfession to killing Fawcett and his companions. He claimed that Fawcett hadslapped his face when he had refused carriers, and that he had clubbed him todeath; the other two, he said, had been killed defending Fawcett.This story raises doubts: a man with Fawcett’s self-control would not be likelyto strike a tribal chief. Izarari also alleged that Jack Fawcett had seduced oneof his wives, which sounds more likely. In later years, many travellers claimedto have learned the truth about Fawcett’s death, and one of the more plausiblestories is that Jack Fawcett had violated some tribal taboo, and that his crimehad to be punished by death else Izarari’s people would themselves becomeoutcasts and killed by other tribes.Whatever happened, it seems clear that Fawcett never reached the city he called‘Z’, or the deserted city of Manuscript No. 512.I finished Exploration Fawcett in an odd state of frustration. No one who readsit could doubt that Fawcett knew exactly where he was going and what he waslooking for. He had talked to many people – Europeans and Indians – about lostcities, and was quite certain that they existed and knew roughly where theywere.19 The person I needed to consult was obviously Rand, whose fascinationwith Fawcett and Brazil had started when he found references to him in theHapgood archive at Yale in 1995. He was also interested in South America, sincehe felt that if Atlantis was Antarctica, then it was almost certain that many ofits inhabitants escaped to South America.Rand had one site in mind as the location of the deserted city. He had alreadyascertained that if Giza is used as the post-Atlantis prime meridian, a wholeseries of sites fall on multiples of 10 degrees: Tiahuanaco is 100 degrees westof the Great Pyramid, Quito is at 110 degrees, and so on. It seemed to Rand thatthere ought to be a major sacred site at 90 degrees from Giza, not merelybecause it is a multiple of ten but because it is also a quarter of the distancearound the world.Tiahuanaco’s latitude (16 degrees, 38 minutes) had at first seemeddisappointing, until Rand realised that it is 10 phi from the pole. The perfectplace for a major religious site in the Matto Grosso would be at 90 degrees westof Giza, and 10 phi south.I looked up this site in my Times Atlas, but saw that this could not have beenFawcett’s objective on that last journey. It was about 50 miles south of Cuiaba– Fawcett’s last major halt – and on the border of Bolivia and Brazil. However,as Rand pointed out to me, it was in an area that Fawcett had explored duringhis surveying days (the area where he and his companions had almost starved todeath). In Mysteries of Ancient South America, Harold Wilkins states: ‘Fawcett’sfriends speak of other strange tales brought to the Colonel by wanderingIndians, whose tribal law he had studied in the Matto Grosso and the borders ofBrazil and Bolivia.’20 It seems at least probable that this site is the locationof the city that was half covered by jungle, but it was not on Fawcett’s routeduring that final journey.Meanwhile I had faxed to Rand Fawcett’s own map of his intended route (fromExploration Fawcett), together with his coordinates for the ‘city of 1753’. Iwas hoping, of course, that Fawcett’s coordinates (11 degrees, 30 minutes south,42 degrees, 30 minutes west) would fall on one of Rand’s sacred sites, but itwas not to be. It turned out to be 73 degrees, 38 minutes west of Giza, and interms of the ‘blueprint’ that means nothing.But Rand, far from being disappointed, recognised that it provided an importantclue. He noted another possible sacred site within 100 miles of the ‘city of1753’, at 72 degrees west of Giza, which is one-fifth of the distance around theworld, and again 10 degrees south. He wrote to me:Fawcett gave 11 degrees 30 minutes south and 42 degrees 30 minutes west for thesite of the ‘city of 1753’, whereas the ‘blueprint’ location is 10 degrees southand 40 degrees 52 minutes west. When you round out the blueprint longitude tothe closest half degree (which seems to have been Fawcett’s practice), itbecomes 41 degrees west. Please note the following:[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_009_r1.jpg]The Giza Prime Meridian links sacred sites from Easter Island (140 West of GreatPyramid) to Tiahuanaco (100WGP). This pattern can be extended into the Amazon,where other sacred sites await discovery. Each box represents a sacred site or apotential sacred site.From left to right they are: Quito (Equator 110WGP); Tiahuanaco (10PhiS 100WGP);Lost Atlantean City (10PhiS 90WGP); Fawcett disappeared here; Potential sacredsites (10S 80WGP and 15S 80WGP); Fawcett’s Z location; Potential sacred site(10S 72WGP)11 degrees 30 minutes south, 42 degrees 30 minutes west– Fawcett’s location ofthe city of 1753 minus 10 degrees south, 41 degrees west – Atlantis blueprintlocation to the nearest Greenwich longitude equals 1 degree 30 minutes, 1 degree30 minutes.Both are off one and a half degrees.In short, Rand suspected that Fawcett had disguised the location by one and ahalf degrees east and south.Rand made another interesting point. If Fawcett was disguising the location ofthe ‘deserted city’ by adding 1 degree 30 minutes to both its co-ordinates, thenhe was identifying a spot that is one-fifth of the way around the world from theGiza meridian. Is it possible that Fawcett had also stumbled on this notion ofthe Giza meridian? Fawcett was a youth of seventeen when Smyth was agitating forthe prime meridian to run through Giza, arguing that the ancients probably usedGiza as their central meridian. Fawcett knew Egypt well, since he was workingfor British Intelligence in Cairo during the war, and he was also a surveyor.Could he have been using the Giza meridian to locate possible sites for ancientcities in South America?As I pored over the map of Brazil, I was struck by another matter. Fawcett seemsto have chosen a very strange route. Cuiaba is about 1,000 miles west of thesite he was aiming at (the deserted city), and 700 miles south. Bahia itself –his ultimate goal – is only about 250 miles east of ‘the deserted city’ (whichmakes sense; the lost mines of Muribeca cannot possibly have been far from thecoast, or it would have taken too long to transport the silver to Bahia). Itlooks – as G.K. Chesterton put it in one of his poems – as if Fawcett haddecided to go to Bannockburn by way of Brighton Pier. Why would Fawcett havestarted from Cuiaba, 1,000 miles east of the deserted city? Why not go west fromBahia to the deserted city?A possible explanation occurred to me, and, as Rand’s next email showed, it haddawned on him at the same time. If sacred longitudes run in tens, then Fawcettwould be crossing yet another on his way west – the 80-degree longitude west ofGiza (which is about 49 degrees west of Greenwich). Since he would be travellingalong the 10th parallel – another sacred latitude – the likeliest location forthe city he calls ‘Z’ is where the 80th and the 10th cross.This crossing point of the two meridians – 80 degrees west of Giza, and 10degrees south – is only about 200 miles northeast of where Fawcett vanished. If‘Z’ was a sacred site, then this, according to the blueprint, is its most likelylocation. From ‘Z’, Fawcett would have to travel almost 500 miles east to reachthe deserted city of 1753.Which brings us back to the question: why would Fawcett want to disguise itslocation?Perhaps Fawcett was hoping to return to England to announce his discovery ofthree ‘lost cities’. One he already knew – the city covered by jungle. If hecould also pinpoint ‘Z’ and the deserted city of 1753, his triumph would becomplete. He would have been hailed as one of the greatest explorers of alltime, the manuscript of Exploration Fawcett, back at his home in Devon, wouldcertainly become a bestseller, and he would have plenty of funds for anotherexpedition. Even if he failed, he would certainly want to return to Brazil, andif anyone had seen the manuscript in the meantime, then he might be beaten tohis objective by a rival. It would be a simple, obvious precaution to disguisethe location of the deserted city until he had been there.Whether Rand is correct about the locations of the three lost cities may not beas difficult to establish as one might suppose. Nowadays it is unnecessary foran explorer to equip an expedition and plunge into the Brazilian jungle. A spacesatellite, using the kind of radar that was used to penetrate the clouds ofVenus, would only have to overfly the site – and track it in strips – to locateruins buried under vegetation.21 Archaeologists have even developed a radar thatcan penetrate the ground and locate ruins buried under sand.What they have not yet developed is a method for deciding where to look, andthis is what Rand has provided with his Atlantis blueprint.Rand had already discovered that if you drew a line from the Great Pyramid tothe North Pole, and another line from the Great Pyramid to the old North Pole,in Hudson Bay, the angle between the two is 28 degrees, and that 28 plays animportant part in the Giza site (see Chapter 4).Intrigued by this discovery, Rand had begun to look for other examples of arelationship between the two poles. From Rosslyn, the site of the Templar churchin Scotland, the angle[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_010_r1.jpg]Two of the sites that Fawcett was interested in were located at 12N during theHudson Bay Pole. From the Lost Atlantean City the Hudson Bay Pole is 12 degreeswest of north. This is a 12/12 site.12N latitude during Hudson Bay Pole; 12 º(the line to the left of 90)between the two poles is 50 degrees. But its latitude is also 50 degrees north.Rand called this a 50/50 site. Again, Stonehenge was at a latitude of 46degrees, and the angle between the two poles from Stonehenge was also 46 degrees– another ‘double’ site, 46/46. And when he discovered many more of these‘double’ sites, he became convinced that this was one of the basic factors thatled the ancients to regard a certain site as sacred. This is why his suggestionfor the location for one of Fawcett’s lost cities (the one covered invegetation) was at a spot where the angle between the poles was 12 degrees andthe latitude was also 12 degrees south – a 12/12 site.Rand then took an interesting leap in the dark. From the Giza meridian, the onlyimportant line of longitude (i.e., a multiple of ten) that runs through Englandis 30. If the blueprint theory is correct, there ought to be a major sacred siteon[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_011_r1.jpg]Canterbury Cathedral may have been built on top of a much more ancient site.During the Hudson Bay Pole it was midway between the pole and the equator atlatitude 45N. The angle between Canterbury, the current pole and the formerHudson Bay Pole is 45 degrees. Canterbury is a 45/45 site. It is also 30 degreeswest of the Great Pyramid and during the Hudson Bay Pole, when Giza was at 15N,Canterbury was 30 degrees further north at 45N.this line. Rand ran his finger down a map of England, and found that the lineran through Canterbury, England’s most sacred site.He drew an imaginary line to the North Pole and to the old North Pole in HudsonBay. The angle between them was 45 degrees, and Canterbury was at 45 degreesnorth during the Hudson Bay Pole. So Canterbury is a 45/45 site, and since itwas 30 degrees north of Giza, and also on the 30-degree longitude, it is a 30/30site relative to Giza.Canterbury may be regarded as a relatively modern site. Its first cathedral wasbuilt soon after St Augustine’s arrival in England in AD 597. Before Augustine’sarrival, however, it was the capital of Ethelbert, the Saxon king who became aChristian. And a little research into Dean Stanley’s Memorials of Canterburyreveals that Ethelbert gave the site of a pagan temple to Augustine, who,following the decree of Gregory the Great to build on pagan sites, built anabbey there, and later began to build the cathedral nearby.The pagan temple had been built on a 45/45 site – that is to say, by someonewith a knowledge of the Hudson Bay Pole. England’s most important religioussite, Canterbury, also fits perfectly into Rand’s Atlantis blueprint.What is most significant about the line of investigation opened up by Lubaantumis that Rand had found it by applying his theory that a sacred site ought to befound at that location, at the 10 phi longitude north. If his theory wasunsound, the odds against anything being found at that site would have been amillion to one. When he located Lubaantum at a longitude of 10 phi north andlatitude 120 degrees west, he had virtually confirmed Smyth’s belief that themeridian used by the ancient Egyptians was the line of longitude that ran northand south through the Great Pyramid."},{"pageContent":"4THOTH'S HOLY CHAMBERACCORDING TO HERODOTUS, contemporary Egyptians had decided on a crudelysimplistic explanation of the purpose of the Great Pyramid; they said it wasbasically a monument to the vainglory of the pharaoh Cheops (Khufu). Thewickedness of Cheops was unsurpassed – he closed down all the temples during hisfifty-six-year reign, and when he ran out of money to build the Great Pyramid,sent his daughter out to work as a harlot. She made enough not only to completeits construction, but also to build a pyramid of her own. Herodotus was alsotold that underneath the Great Pyramid there were a series of vaults ‘for thePharaoh’s own use’, so that it also served as a luxury apartment. Nile water wasintroduced by means of a tunnel, forming an underground lake in the midst ofwhich there was an island on which Cheops was laid to rest. The Great Pyramid,apart from being a monument to monstrous egoism, was also a tomb then. Thenotion of the pyramids as tombs persists down to the present day – in hisstandard work on the pyramids of Egypt, Professor Ion Edwards states that theywere intended as tombs and nothing more.This assumption has been questioned. In The Riddle of the Pyramids,1 KurtMendelssohn, a physicist who studied under Max Planck then turned his attentionto the problem of why the pyramids were built, concluded that there was littleevidence that they were tombs. Of the ten major pyramids, only one, the StepPyramid of King Zoser (or Djoser) at Saqqara, showed unmistakable signs of beinga tomb, although mummy fragments found in its granite vault proved – whensubjected to radiocarbon-dating – to be dated to several centuries later thanZoser’s reign. Of the other nine pyramids, only three had sarcophagi (which wereempty) – it is hard to see why thieves should have gone to the trouble ofstealing the other six.Mendelssohn’s own somewhat unlikely theory is that the pyramids were merely a‘work project’ designed to unite Egypt’s tribes into a nation state, although itcould be asked why the pharaohs did not choose a more practical task, likebuilding harbours or dams. All the same, Mendelssohn’s objections to the tombtheory are certainly convincing, particularly in the case of the Great Pyramiditself. When Herodotus went there, it was covered in gleaming limestone, and wasalready 2,000 years old.In AD 820, the caliph Al-Mamun, son of Haroun Al-Raschid, decided to break intoit to see whether, as legend declared, it was full of fabulous treasures, butthere seemed to be no way in. The position of a hidden door, high up on thenorth side, had long been forgotten.Chisels failed to dent the limestone, so Al-Mamun ordered fires to be lit tocrack it, then attacked it with battering rams. After months of exhaustingeffort, his men had only tunnelled a hundred feet or so. Just as they were aboutto give up, one of the workmen heard a dull thud nearby. They finally broke intoa narrow tunnel, and saw that a large stone had fallen from its ceiling.By sheer luck they had entered several courses below the original entrance,otherwise they might have tunnelled on until they came out the other side.Crawling up the sloping tunnel they found the entrance, covered with a hingedstone. Crawling back down the other way, they eventually found themselves in asmall subterranean chamber with a vermin-infested pit and a short tunnel runningout of the other side until it simply came to a halt. This seemed to be thedisappointing reality of Herodotus’s lake, island and luxury apartment.But at the point where the stone had fallen from the ceiling, they found apassage ascending towards the heart of the pyramid. This proved to be blocked bya massive granite plug. They used their chisels to cut into the limestone aroundit, only to find another plug, and then yet another. Finally they were able tostand upright, and were faced with another low corridor that ran horizontally.It led to a barn-like chamber with a gabled roof and salt-encrusted walls – butit was empty. They labelled this the Queen’s Chamber, since Arab tombs for womenhad pointed roofs. They hacked out part of a wall, but found no treasure.Retracing their steps to the place where they could stand upright, theydiscovered that the ascending passage continued upward, but that a connectingpart of the causeway had been removed, presumably to discourage furtherexploration. Suddenly the corridor turned into an awesome gallery, whose slopingwalls stretched far above their heads. At the top of this smooth slope theyfound their way blocked by a 3-foot-tall stone. After clambering over this, theyfound themselves in what came to be called the Antechamber, faced with a kind ofgiant portcullis made of granite, which seemed designed to be lowered to blockthe intruders’ further progress – except that the grooves at the sidesterminated 4 feet above the floor, so it could never be lowered. Beyond that,the walls contained three more ‘portcullis’ grooves, this time down to thefloor, but no portcullises.They continued down another low passageway, finally arriving at a larger andrectangular chamber, which became known as the King’s Chamber. This was alsoempty, except for a huge granite sarcophagus that was lacking its lid. It was sobig that it must obviously have been introduced while the King’s Chamber wasbeing built, for it was too large to have been brought up the ascending passage.So it seemed that the Great Pyramid was not a tomb, as it would have beenimpossible for there to have been a coffin inside the sarcophagus – there was noway that tomb robbers could have got it out.It has been generally assumed that the granite plugs must have been slid intoplace from above, and had been stored in the ‘Grand Gallery’, but once theworkmen had allowed them to slide into place, how had they escaped? There wereno skeletons to suggest they had been entombed alive. The problem remainedunsolved for 800 years until, in 1638, an English astronomer called John Greavesnoticed a stone missing from the ramp at the west side of the Grand Gallery,just before it rejoined the narrower passage. It looked like a kind of well, butwhen Greaves tried to lower himself down it he found that it was blocked withsand and rubble and gave up. Two centuries later, in 1814, an Italian namedGiovanni Caviglia made a more determined attempt, and found that the ‘well’descended to the low passageway that led down to the subterranean chamber withthe vermin-infested pit.This route, then, must have allowed the workmen to escape after sliding thegranite plugs into place – unless, of course, the top of the Pyramid was stillopen at that time (this latter was an obvious possibility, for someone must haveblocked the well with sand and rubble, presumably from above).So the Great Pyramid remained a mystery consisting of many small mysteries. Why,for example, had the Queen’s Chamber been left unfinished, as the rough state ofits floor suggested? And why were its walls covered in crystallised salt? And,if the pharaoh had changed his mind and decided that he would prefer a largerchamber built on a higher level, why did he not place the King’s Chamberdirectly above the Queen’s Chamber? The latter is placed symmetrically in thecentre of[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_012_r1.jpg]Cross-section of the Great Pyramid of Gizathe Pyramid, where you might expect a burial chamber to be; the King’s Chamberis located slightly beyond this meridian.One theory that seems to fit these facts is based on the speculations ofProfessor I. E. S. Edwards, one of the British Museum’s foremost authorities onthe pyramids. Around 2,500 BC, the pharaoh Cheops (Khufu) decided to buildhimself a tomb that should be impregnable to thieves. Having surveyed thesubterranean chamber his workmen had hacked out of the rock, he felt it was toostuffy and depressing and decided to build himself a pyramid, like his fatherand grandfather. The Queen’s Chamber was a deliberate red herring, to persuadeany robbers who had penetrated that far that there was nothing for them tosteal. Such robbers would only carry torches or candles, and would probably notnotice that another passage ran above their heads.At that point, his obsession about tomb robbers developed into paranoia, and hedecided to have the ascending passage blocked with the granite plugs to makequite sure that no robbers could get that far. But the plugs needed to be slidinto place. For that reason, the floor of the Grand Gallery was made smooth, sothey could be stored there and slid down. At the top of the Grand Gallery heplaced another obstacle in the form of a tall stone, and on its other side wasthe antechamber and the King’s Chamber, which he had chosen for his tomb. He hadhis sarcophagus placed ready, but at this point he realised that it would bevirtually impossible to carry the coffin up to the chamber – the granite plugsand the tall stone blocked the way.The only solution was to slide the granite plugs into place there and then andto leave the Great Pyramid unfinished until after his death, when his coffincould be brought into the King’s Chamber from above. But that would entailleaving the Great Pyramid open until he died. In the meantime, any number ofthieves could creep in by night and explore its secrets.At which point, I suggest, Cheops gave up in disgust. The Great Pyramid itself,he decided, should become a gigantic red herring, to divert tomb robbers fromhis true resting place. And to this day we have no idea of where his body lies…Why did he order the ‘well’ to be dug, then blocked up with rubble? Perhapsbecause, just before the Great Pyramid was completed, he had a sudden pang ofregret at the thought that he would never again look upon his magnificenthandiwork, and left this hidden entrance…One objection to this theory is the matter of why he ordered his workmen toconstruct so many puzzling anomalies. Why are there slots cut into the walls ofthe antechamber, as if to hold three massive ‘portcullis’ stones, when no suchstones are to be found? Why is there a niche in the wall of the Queen’s Chamberthat is slightly off-centre? Why does a 2-foot step suddenly appear in thepassage to the Queen’s Chamber? Why do ‘air vents’ out of the Queen’s Chamberfail to reach the outside and were not even taken through the walls of theChamber? There are, of course, ‘air vents’ out of the King’s Chamber – but whatis the purpose of air vents in a tomb? And why did the builders decide to buildthe thirty-sixth course of far larger blocks than the other courses – surely itwould have made sense to place the largest at the bottom?Above all there is the mystery of the Grand Gallery. Why, when most of thepassages in the Great Pyramid are so low that it is necessary to stoop (or evencrawl), did the pharaoh order his workmen to build a passageway 7 feet wide, 28feet high and 157 feet long? Why does it narrow to half its width by the time itreaches the ceiling? And why is the ceiling not flat, like most of the ceilingsin the Great Pyramid, but made of overlapping blocks, as if designed as stepsfor a man who could walk upside down? And why is there a raised ramp on eitherside of the upward slope, making it a sunken channel? And why are there squareholes cut on the wall side of the ramp, making it look – from above – like apiece of cinema film?The answer, clearly, is God only knows. Common sense seems to afford no clues tothe answers. And therein lies the merit of J Charles Piazzi Smyth. He at leastmade the world aware that the Great Pyramid is a giant enigma.Regrettably, his efforts were in some respects too successful. A Scotsman namedRobert Menzies took their theories to a logical extreme. If God was the authorof the Great Pyramid as well as of the Bible, then it should obviously beregarded as a book in stone; all that remained was to decipher its message,which must be conveyed in terms of measurements. The way from the entrance tothe three chambers must be a symbolic journey through time, probably withpyramid inches representing years, including all the great events of the world’shistory, among them the flood, the Exodus, the Crucifixion and the SecondComing. The beginning of the Grand Gallery marked the birth of Christ, and,counting back from there, it could easily be verified that the world had beencreated in 4,004 BC, just as Archbishop Ussher had declared in 1650.Smyth had worked out that the Pole Star, which was then Alpha Draconis, hadshone straight through the entrance and down the descending passage when theGreat Pyramid was build in 2,100 BC (missing the actual date by about fourcenturies). Menzies declared that there should be some indication on the wallsof the Descending Passage marking the year, and was delighted when Smyth toldhim of two scored lines on either side of the passage at the spot that marked2,100 BC – and so was confirmed in his peculiar form of insanity.Within a decade or so, the Great Pyramid became the happy hunting ground ofreligious cranks all over the world. In Boston, a society was formed to altermodern measuring units to those used by the Pyramid’s builders, and wassupported by President Garfield. In England, a book called Miracle in Stone(1877)2 by Joseph Seiss became a bestseller. A preacher named Charles TazeRussell became a convert, and founded the Jehovah’s Witnesses on the basis ofPyramid prophecies, in 1891 announcing that the Battle of Armageddon would occurin 1914 and that all Jehovah’s Witnesses would thereafter live forever on a‘paradise earth’. When 1914 failed to bring the end of the world, thousands ofJehovah’s Witnesses left the movement in disillusionment, and Russell haddifficulty convincing those that remained that Christ had returned, butinvisibly. When Russell died in 1916, his successor ‘Judge’ Rutherford decidedto discard pyramidology; he explained that Russell had been deluded by Satan,realising the danger of setting a definite date for the end of the world whenhis own choice, 1925, passed without incident.The beliefs of an early pyramidologist, John Taylor, that the British were theten lost tribes of Israel led to another highly successful movement, the BritishIsraelites, whose Bible was a vast work by David Davidson called The GreatPyramid: Its Divine Message (1924),3 which announced that the ‘finaltribulation’ of the Anglo-Saxon race would last from 1928 to 1936, and thatArmageddon would occur in 1953.According to the British Israelites, another date that would be of immensesignificance to the world was 16 September 1936. The only newsworthy item thatday was that the Duke of Windsor told his prime minister that he intended tomarry Mrs Simpson, an interesting but not world-shaking event.A few ‘pyramidiots’ (as a modern writer has called them) were perhaps a smallprice to pay for the tremendous impetus given to the study of the pyramids byTaylor and Smyth. They had made a very serious point: the mathematical andtechnological knowledge revealed by the Great Pyramid seems far toosophisticated for ‘primitives’ who tilled their fields with pointed sticks. IfTaylor and Smyth had lived a century later, they might well have preferred the‘ancient astronaut’ alternative to the idea that the Great Pyramid’s buildersworked under the direct guidance of God. Anyone who finds either viewunacceptable must be driven to the only other conclusion: that the Egyptiansknew far more than historians supposed.John West expressed the problem in Serpent in the Sky, summarising the views ofSchwaller de Lubicz:Egyptian science, medicine, mathematics and astronomy were all of anexponentially higher order of refinement and sophistication than modern scholarswill acknowledge. The whole of Egyptian civilisation was based upon a completeand precise understanding of universal laws… Moreover, every aspect of Egyptianknowledge seems to have been complete at the very beginning. The sciences,artistic and architectural techniques and the hieroglyphic system show virtuallyno sign of a period of ‘development’; indeed, many of the achievements of theearlier dynasties were never surpassed or even equalled later on.4West argues that it would have been virtually impossible for Egypt to havereached such a degree of sophistication in a mere 500 years – the time Egyptiancivilisation is supposed to have been founded. It is rather, West says, as ifthe first motor car had been a modern Rolls-Royce.Scholars in the ancient world should have realised that the builders of theGreat Pyramid knew far more than ‘primitives’ were supposed to know – at least,after Agatharchides of Cnidus revealed that the base of the Great Pyramid is aknown percentage of the earth’s circumference. But at that time no one knew ifthis calculation was correct; in fact, no one was interested, for most peoplethought the earth was flat. By the time of Charles Piazzi Smyth, everyone knewthe earth was round, so his revelation that the Egyptians knew the value of pileft Victorian scientists in little doubt that the Egyptians had achieved asophisticated level of mathematics.The Great Pyramid continues to offer unsolved mysteries. One modern student,Christopher P. Dunn, consulted a manager of the Indiana Limestone Instituteabout how long it would take their thirty-three quarries to cut and deliveraround 2.5 million blocks, each weighing between 6 and 30 tons, and was toldthat, using modern rock-cutting machinery, it would take twenty-seven years. Butno one has worked out how the builders moved these blocks up a 52-degree slope.Herodotus says that they had a machine made of short wooden planks to lift theblocks, but since the flat top of the ‘step’ is often as little as 6 inches widethis is not practicable. A better suggestion is that they built a gently slopingramp and heaved the blocks up it with ropes, which would have worked well forthe lower courses, but as the Great Pyramid got higher the ramp would have tobecome longer and steeper and of sufficiently solid construction not to collapseunder its own weight. It would need to be about a mile long, and would requireas much stone as the structure itself. A modern builder would need a crane morethan 500 feet high, with a boom of 400 feet – there is no crane of that size inthe world today, and one certainly did not exist in ancient Egypt.Another problem is the time factor. Herodotus was told that the Great Pyramidtook twenty years to build, which would have involved placing about 340 blocksin position every day, an impossible task without heavy lifting machinery. Amore reasonable estimate would be thirty-four blocks a day, but this would meanthat it took 200 years to build.Christopher P. Dunn, the British toolmaker and engineer already mentioned, hasexamined the Great Pyramid from the engineering point of view. His study led himto conclude – in an article called ‘Advanced Machining in Ancient Egypt’ – thatthe Egyptian pyramids and temples ‘reveal glimpses of a civilisation that wastechnically more advanced than is generally believed’. Examining blocks that hadbeen hollowed out with some kind of drill in the Valley Temple, in front of theSphinx, he noted that the marks left in the hole showed that it was cutting intothe rock at a rate of one-tenth of an inch for every revolution of the drill,and he concludes that this could not be achieved by hand. A hole drilled into arock made of quartz and feldspar provided another strange observation. The drillhad cut faster through the quartz than the feldspar, even though quartz isharder than feldspar. Dunn points out that modern ultrasonic machining dependson vibration, like the chisel of a pneumatic drill, which vibrates up and down.An ultrasonic drill vibrates tens of thousands of times faster. Quartz crystals,which can be used to produce ultrasonic sound, also respond to ultrasonicvibrations, which would enable an ultrasonic drill to cut through them faster.Does this suggest that there were ultrasonic drills in ancient Egypt?The notion sounds ridiculous, yet the mystery of the Great Pyramid led SirFlinders Petrie, the grand old man of Egyptology, to suggest an idea almost asstrange. In his standard work The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh (1883),5 hecasually threw off the suggestion that the sarcophagus, whose external volume isprecisely twice that of its internal volume, was cut with an 8-foot saw that wasmade of bronze with diamonds in the cutting edge. No such saws, of course, haveever been found; neither have the drills that Petrie thought were used to hollowout the sarcophagus.Christopher Dunn’s close study of the Pyramid made him aware that its precisionseems almost superhuman. He asked an engineer who worked at stone cutting in thequarries of Indiana what tolerances they worked to (i.e., how much inaccuracydid they allow themselves). He was told ‘pretty close’, which was defined as ‘aquarter of an inch’. When told that the blocks of the Great Pyramid were cut to0.01 tolerance, the stonecutter was incredulous.6In a TV programme Dunn produced a device used by engineers to test that a metalsurface has been machined to a thousandth of an inch, and applied it to thesacred stone called the Benben, in the Cairo Museum. He shone a powerful torchon one side of the metal, and looked on the other side to see if any gleam oflight showed through. There was none whatever.Petrie’s examination of the casing stones of the Great Pyramid showed that theyhad been cut according to highly accurate engineering tolerances. But why shouldthe Pyramid’s builders have worked to machine-shop tolerances rather than thoseof a construction site, as you would expect? And even more baffling: how? Whattools were used to cut granite or limestone with such precision? This is thekind of precision we would expect of an optician, but not a builder.In trying to fashion a theory that might explain the purpose of the GreatPyramid, Dunn was struck by a comment made by Colonel Howard-Vyse, one of theearly explorers who had discovered four of the five ‘relieving chambers’ abovethe King’s Chamber. Howard-Vyse had noted that when he stood in the King’sChamber, he was able to hear people speaking in the subterranean chamber,indicating that the acoustics of the Great Pyramid are as perfect as those of aconcert hall.TV producer Boris Said – who, together with John West, made the documentary TheMystery of the Sphinx – had said in the promotion material of anotherdocumentary:Subsequent experiments conducted by Tom Danley in the King’s Chamber of theGreat Pyramid and in chambers above the King’s Chamber suggest that the pyramidwas constructed with a sonic purpose. Danley identifies four residentfrequencies, or notes, that are enhanced by the structure of the pyramid, and bythe materials used in its construction. The notes from an F sharp chord…according to ancient Egyptian texts were the harmonic of our planet. Moreover,Danley’s tests show that these frequencies are present in the King’s Chambereven when no sounds are being produced. They are there in frequencies that rangefrom 16 Hertz down to 12/ Hertz, well below the range of human hearing.According to Danley, these vibrations are caused by the wind blowing across theends of the so-called shafts in the same way as sounds are created when oneblows across the neck of a bottle.7He went on to mention that a producer of Native American sacred flutes, createdto ‘serenade’ Mother Earth, tunes them to the key of F sharp.This notion that Egyptian pyramids – and temples – are tuned to sound has becomeincreasingly widespread. In November 1998 I joined a trip to Egypt organised byRobert Bauval in which John West acted as tour guide. Together with a number ofother writers – among them Robert Temple, Michael Baigent, Yuri Stoyanov andRalph Ellis – we looked at many Egyptian temples, including Karnak and Luxor,Dendera, Edfu and the Oseirion at Abydos. Again and again we noted theiracoustic properties as members of the group intoned notes in closed chambers, oreven in doorways. It was as if the stone was a giant tuning fork.In 1998 scientists at Southampton University discovered that the stones ofStonehenge also have acoustic properties and would have acted as giganticamplifiers for drums during festivals, their flat surfaces accumulating and thendeflecting sound over a wide area.It was in the immense Temple of Horus, at Edfu, midway between Luxor and Aswan,that my attention was drawn to the importance of sound. An Egyptian historiannamed Emil Shaker showed me some hieroglyphics on the wall close to thesanctuary, pointing out how they specified the number of times the temple ritualhad to be performed. In this case it was three. He explained: ‘It is no useperforming the ritual two or four times. It will not work. If it says threetimes, it means three times.’ This ritual, like all religious rituals, involveschanting a hymn to the sun and presenting the god with offerings.I asked, ‘But what does the ritual actually do?’‘It activates the temple.’‘You mean like switching on a light?’ I said, giving voice to the first imagethat came into my head.‘Exactly like switching on a light,’ said Emil.I found this notion fascinating – a ritual involving chanting could ‘activate’ atemple. Emil made it sound as if it was as automatic as switching on a light, orgoing through a certain sequence of actions to send an email.According to my guidebook, John West’s Traveler’s Key to Ancient Egypt,8 theEdfu temple was built over a period of 200 years, between 257 and 57 BC, butpart of it dated back to the pyramid age. It is built, of course, on ‘hallowedground’.The sanctuary looked rather like an immense stone box turned on its side. Idecided to walk all the way around it but found the narrow passage at the backblocked by someone who was obviously meditating, with his forehead and palmspressed against the stone. I realised that it was Michael Baigent, the co-author(with Henry Lincoln and Richard Leigh) of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail.9 Ibacked away so as not to disturb him, and instead followed John West to look atthe famous ‘Building Texts’ inscribed on the walls – texts that refer back tothe remote age called the ‘First Time’, when seven sages designed the templesand pyramids.An hour later, back on the boat, Robert Bauval told me that Michael Baigent hadnot returned with the rest of us on the bus, and asked me if I could give alecture in his place that afternoon. Everyone was concerned, since Baigent couldonly rejoin us further down the Nile by taking a taxi, and we were in ‘banditcountry’ – not long ago, tourists had been machine-gunned to death at the Templeof Hatshepsut. When Michael later turned up unharmed, after I had given hislecture, I asked him what had happened.‘I don’t know. I was meditating for a few minutes, then I found you’d all gone.’I told him that I had seen him behind the sanctuary. ‘That wasn’t a few minutesbefore we left – it was at least twenty minutes.’He was incredulous. ‘It only seemed a few minutes.’He may have simply lost track of time, but I am inclined to believe that he had‘tuned in’ to the vibrations of that hallowed ground, vibrations that are stillpowerful after more than 2,000 years.In Bauval and Hancock’s Keeper of Genesis I find a quotation from the scholar E.A. E. Reymond, which refers to the ‘founding, building and bringing to life [myitalics] of the historical temple of Edfu’. This ‘bringing to life’, thisactivation, is brought about by a ritual that involves sound.The earth also has its own frequency, known as the Schumann Resonance, whichresults from electromagnetic activity between the earth and the upperatmosphere. It is far too low in frequency to be heard, but Christopher Dunnfound himself speculating whether, if the Great Pyramid was constructed withsome ‘sonic’ purpose, as Tom Danley suspected, and if it was deliberately builtto correspond to the size of the earth, its purpose might be connected with theearth’s vibrations.Dunn had already conducted some of his own experiments. In February 1995, whenvisiting Egypt with Bauval and Hancock, he bribed an inspector to leave him inthe King’s Chamber alone for half an hour after it closed to visitors. Theinspector assumed he wanted to meditate, and agreed to turn off the lights. Infact, Dunn wanted the lights turned off so that no background hum would spoilhis tape recording. He was also carrying a digital frequency counter to measurethe radio frequencies he thought might be generated by the King’s Chamber.When the sound of tourists had receded into the distance, he thumped the side ofthe sarcophagus with his fist and listened to the humming sound it made. Hehummed this note to test the resonance, then hummed his way up the scale untilnoted that the resonance became even more powerful when he reached the note anoctave higher.Concerned that he was running out of time, he went through to the Antechamber toyell down at the guard to turn off the lights, whose humming was spoiling hisrecording. Then, still humming the note of the sarcophagus, he went back to theKing’s Chamber, where he realised that the humming of the fans in the ‘airshafts’ was still spoiling his recording. After a few more recordings, he leftthe Great Pyramid and walked back to his hotel.Back in his room he played back his recording and realised that his time had notbeen wasted after all. The note he had been humming had caused overtones –sympathetic vibrations – in the Chamber. When he listened to his own voicecalling for the lights to be turned off, he was astonished that it sounded as ifhe was still in the Chamber and not on the far side of the Antechamber, despitethe fact that walls and leaves of granite and limestone stood between himselfand the recorder. His humming was also clearly recorded. He also noted that thesound of his footsteps as he walked back from the Grand Gallery resonatedclearly at the Chamber’s natural resonance – the note of the sarcophagus.Dunn had proved two things: that, as Howard-Vyse had said, the Great Pyramidseemed to have perfect acoustics, and that the King’s Chamber was a kind ofsounding box, producing the same note as the sarcophagus. In fact, it was morethan a matter of perfect acoustics. The Great Pyramid was designed like theWhispering Gallery in St Paul’s Cathedral in London, where a whisper at one sideof the gallery is reflected around the walls.Dunn’s own observations were confirmed by the scientist Stephen Mehler, who hadalso made recordings in the King’s Chamber. These had been analysed by a soundengineer named Robert Vawter, who agreed that the King’s Chamber was designed asa resonance chamber.Even if we agree that the Pyramid was intended to be a sounding box, this stillleaves the question of why. Christopher Dunn’s own conviction was that theimportant clue was the fact that the Great Pyramid’s proportions are the same asthose of the earth, suggesting that the ‘sounding box’ was intended to vibrateto the earth. Or, as he puts it in his book The Giza Power Plant,10 ‘the pyramidacts as a receiver of energy from within the earth itself.Inevitably, most readers will feel that the notion of the Great Pyramid as agiant resonator is far fetched, but sceptics will also have to admit that Dunnsucceeds in making sense of its anomalies and apparent absurdities, producingplausible explanations for all kinds of features, from the subterranean galleryto the iron plate with traces of gold found at the top of the southern airshaft. One of Dunn’s illustrations is based upon Charles Piazzi Smyth’s drawings(see page 64).The Great Pyramid is not only located on the meridian that covers more land thanany other; it is also at the centre of the earth’s land masses. In addition, itis situated so accurately in the centre of the Nile Delta that a compass pointplaced on the Great Pyramid can neatly enclose the whole Delta in an arc. Thatis why Piazzi Smyth thought the Giza meridian ought to be our modern primemeridian. He also believed that, for the ancient Egyptians, it probably wastheir prime meridian.In The Giza Power Plant, Christopher Dunn has produced a fascinating book aboutthe possible technological purpose of the Great Pyramid. Rand has another,equally interesting theory of the location of what has become known as ‘Thoth’sHoly Chamber’.One of Rand’s major aims, in trying to understand the hidden geometry of theGiza site, was to try to locate this ‘secret chamber’. The notion seems to haveoriginated in a document called the Westcar Papyrus,11 now in the Berlin Museum,which seems to be a New Kingdom copy of a Fifth Dynasty original (soon after thetime of Cheops, or Khufu). It tells how Cheops asked a magician named Djedi thenumber (or precise location) of Thoth’s secret chamber, and was told that itcould be found in a flint chest in a building called the Inventory. But no one,Djedi added, would be able to obtain the number until the coming of three kingsas yet unborn… The papyrus breaks off at this point.In their book Keeper of Genesis, Robert Bauval and Graham Hancock make aninteresting suggestion. Bauval regards the Giza pyramids as a ‘reflection’ onthe ground of the three stars of Orion’s Belt, and he and Hancock explain theirbelief that the secret chamber can be found reflected on the ground where the‘vernal point’ – the location in the heavens of the spring equinox – was locatedin 10,500 BC. This was under the rear paws of the constellation of Leo, andBauval and Hancock go on to suggest that the chamber is therefore located underthe rear paws of the Sphinx.More recently, Nigel Appleby12 has proposed that the secret chamber will befound at a spot on the ground that is a ‘reflection’ of the star Sirius, whichembodies the goddess Isis. This location has proved to be on someone’s allotmenton the outskirts of Cairo, and at the time of writing the theory has not yetbeen tested.Rand, naturally, was inclined to approach this problem of Thoth’s holy chamberfrom the angle of his own Atlantis blueprint. All our researches have led us tobelieve that ancient Egypt preserved the legacy of an earlier civilisation,perhaps of more than one, and that contemporary science is inclined to greatlyunderestimate the intelligence of the people of the remote past. It was, atleast, plausible that there was a hidden cache of knowledge inside or around theGreat Pyramid. TheByzantine historian George Syncellus in the ninth century AD wrote a commentarythat included a reference to a lost Egyptian text called The Book of Sothis,13,which was circulating in the third century BC. This lost book, according toSyncellus, contained important ‘records’ brought to Egypt immediately ‘after theflood’.Robert Bauval, in Secret Chamber,14 unearths another clue in a tract called theKore Kosmou, from the famous ‘Hermetic Writings’ attributed to HermesTrismegistos (or Thoth), of which the most famous sentence is: ‘As above, sobelow.’ Scholars had been inclined to dismiss these writings as Neoplatonisttexts written by Greeks in the third century AD, but more recently it has beenwidely accepted that they date back to early Ptolemaic times in Egypt (i.e.,from 323 BC onwards). In the Kore Kosmou,15 Isis tells her son Horus that thesecret knowledge of Hermes was engraved on stone and hidden away ‘near thesecrets of Osiris’. She also declares that a spell has been cast on these books,to ensure that they remain unseen. The fourth-century Roman historian AmmianusMarcellinus also writes of ‘subterranean passages and winding retreats’ built bymen before the flood to house documents, ‘lest the memory of all their sacredceremonies should be lost’.16Rand had read a children’s book on magic called The Secrets of Alkazar, and hadnever forgotten its advice to aspiring young magicians: pay attention to thetechniques of misdirection. ‘The audience will always look where the magicianlooks. The magician must never look at what he wants to conceal. The audiencewill treat as important what the magician treats as important, and asunimportant what the magician treats as unimportant.’17 Rand reflected that ahidden chamber might well be concealed according to the methods of Alkazar.The most obvious things at Giza are the pyramids and the Sphinx, so someone whowished to conceal something would expect future generations to devote theirattention to these. But supposing this is just ‘misdirection’?[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_013_r1.jpg]In Keys to the Temple, David Furlong discovered that there is a phi relationshipbetween the pyramids at Giza.Rand also recalled that one of the sacred names of the Sphinx is neb, whichmeans ‘the spiralling force of the universe’.18 Why should a spiral beassociated with the Sphinx? Is it possible that the spiral was a Fibonaccispiral?In The Keys to the Temple, David Furlong19 had also pointed out that the goldensection has been used in the layout of the three Giza pyramids:Rand recalled that, in a book called The Giza Necropolis Decoded, (1975),20Rocky McCollum had noted that he could draw a Fibonacci spiral that would touchthe apex of all three Giza pyramids. It folds in on itself, as can be seen, at aspot south-east of the pyramids, between the Sphinx and the Nile. It is Rand’sconviction that Thoth’s Holy Chamber lies at the centre of this spiral.*In September 1980, engineers from the Egyptian Ministry of Irrigation had beenmeasuring the depth of the water table under the Sphinx and set up theirdrilling equipment half a football field to the east of the Sphinx. Theyexpected to have to penetrate about 20 feet and were puzzled when their drillswent on through the sand until, at more then 50 feet, they hit something solid.It proved to be red granite, of the same kind that can be[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_014_r1.jpg]In The Giza Necropolis Decoded, Rocky McCollum created a phi spiral which passedthrough the tips of the pyramids at Giza.found in the antechamber to the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid. Suchgranite is not to be found in the area of Giza; like the black granite thatlines the King’s Chamber, it has to be brought from Aswan, 500 miles south. Theimplication would seem to be that there is some kind of underground chamber. Theirrigation engineers also thought that the layout of the red granite suggestedan ancient harbour.In 1990, the geologist Thomas Dobecki, who accompanied John Anthony West andRobert Schoch to Giza to check the notion that the Sphinx might have beenweathered by water, sent vibrations down into the rock under the Sphinx’s frontpaws and found evidence of a rectangular underground chamber. In October 1992 aFrench engineer named Jean Kerisel was in the ‘descending passage’ that goesdown to the underground chamber of the Great Pyramid, using ground-penetratingradar. Beneath the horizontal passageway that connects the end of the descendingpassage to the underground chamber, Kerisel’s equipment detected a ‘structure’that could be a corridor crossing the horizontal passageway at an angle of about45 degrees. It seemed to lead directly to the Sphinx.The historian Herodotus, as we have seen, had been told of underground chambersintended to be the tomb of Cheops, but this has generally been discounted asmisinformation. That may be so. What does seem certain is that the Giza plateauis honeycombed with underground tunnels.This was again demonstrated in 1977, when a team from Stanford ResearchInstitute22 used a new technique called ‘resistivity’ (which involves thepassing of an electric current into rods driven into the rock) to investigatethe Sphinx, and concluded that behind the north-west rear paws there was an‘anomaly’ that looked like a tunnel running north-west (the direction of theGreat Pyramid) to south-east.If the centre of Rocky McCollum’s Fibonacci spiral is, in fact, Thoth’s HolyChamber, then presumably there is some connection with the Great Pyramid. Randdrew a line fromAt that point, he discovered something that intrigued him. This line, continuedin a straight direction, through the foundation stone in the north-east cornerof the Pyramid, pointed directly at the Hudson Bay Pole. Moreover, if a line wasdrawn from the foundation stone to the North Pole, and another from the Sphinxto the foundation stone, they form an angle of 28 degrees. We have noted inearlier chapters the importance of this angle on the Giza plateau. Randcomments:This solution to the location of the Holy Chamber breaks Thoth’s magic spell byrevealing that the pyramids and Sphinx are the most amazing case of misdirectionever conceived. It solves the mystery of the south-east to northwest directionsthat show up at Giza. This direction points at the former position of the NorthPole when it was in Hudson Bay. The red granite in front of the Sphinx may proveto be a part of a roof covering a secret subterranean structure designed tohouse treasures from a lost world. Only a civilisation equipped with the toolsof astronomy, geometry, geodesics and a knowledge of the former location of theearth’s crust would be able to find the treasure so carefully hidden in the‘desert sands’. Thoth hid his treasure well.Part of that message, he thinks, is a deliberate indication of the direction ofthe Hudson Bay Pole, intended as a warning of what can happen to our earth. Weare not invulnerable. Echoing Hapgood, Rand writes: ‘Our notion of progress isan illusion. We are deceiving ourselves if we think we are immune to the forcesof nature. Civilisation, as the ancients have repeatedly told us, unfolds incycles.’[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_015_r1.jpg] T = Thoth’s Holy Chamber R = Red granite in front of Sphinx H = Hudson Bay Pole @ 28 degrees NWA phi-controlled spiral running through the tips of the Giza pyramids folds inupon itself at a point in the desert.

He has discovered that once a year, at sunset,during the winter solstice, the Middle Pyramid casts a Golden Triangle shadowupon the south-east corner of the Great Pyramid. Once again we find thegeometric appearance of the Golden Section linked with the geographic directionof the south-east. Is the shadow another way of pointing towards Thoth’s HolyChamber.21 this centre point to the foundation stone of the Great Pyramid, andnoted that it passed through the rear paws of the Sphinx, in the same directionas the Stanford researchers’ hypothetical ‘tunnel’."},{"pageContent":"56,000 DEGREES CELSIUSTHE LIBYAN DESERT is one of the most godforsaken wildernesses on earth. Itswhite sand dunes tower like cliffs, often 600 feet high, and there is no sign ofa living thing. Its desolate nature was underlined on 3 June 1971, when threescientists discovered an Egyptian plane in the desert near the Gilf KebirPlateau. The plane had vanished three years earlier and aerial searches hadfailed to locate it. It had crash-landed for some unknown reason, and all thatremained inside were the nine skeletons of the crew. The airmen had obviouslydied of thirst.1The area in which they were found was a broad sand-free corridor of hard rockbetween the giant dunes. The three explorers, Virgil E . Barnes, James Underwoodand Ali Sbeta, were investigating a mystery that had intrigued scientists foralmost forty years: the enigma of the Libyan Desert ‘glass’.Pieces of this ‘glass’, found on the surface of the Libyan Desert — which, inspite of its name, is in Egypt, 500 miles south-west of Cairo — were originallyidentified as ‘tektites’. Often very beautiful, their colour varies from paleyellow to[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_016_r1.jpg]The Libyan Desert glass deposits are located in the desert near latitude 25degrees north and the border between Egypt and Libya.dark yellow and yellow-green, and can be worked by a jeweller into semi-preciousstones. No one really knows where they come from. Most scientists are inclinedto believe that they have originated in space and have melted as they camehurtling down through the atmosphere.For Barnes and his companions, the finding of the crashed plane was a stroke ofluck, for within a hundred yards or so they also found more than two dozentektites lying on the sandstone. They lost no time in returning to their LandRover and setting out on the long drive back to civilisation.On his expedition — funded by the National ScienceFoundation — Barnes was using maps drawn in the 1930s by an English colonel,Patrick Andrew Clayton, who worked for the Egyptian Desert Survey. (In duecourse, these same maps would play an important part in defeating General Rommelin the Second World War.) Barnes was in the Libyan Desert to follow up adiscovery that had been made by Clayton and his friend Professor LeonardSpencer, who had been the Keeper of Minerals in the British Museum for fortyyears.As they were driving along the sand-free corridor in December 1932, Clayton andSpencer had noticed the glitter of shining objects lying on the surface. Theystopped and discovered that they were looking at beautiful pieces of glass,which ranged from the size of a pea to that of an egg. Spencer, who had seenmany tektites, began to look around for a meteorite impact crater that wouldexplain them, but there did not seem to be one nearby. Another puzzle was thatthe tektites were found on the surface; since tektites hit the earth with thespeed of bullets, they might be expected to be embedded in the ground.The two scientists filled the car with about a hundredweight of the shiningyellow fragments — they might have collected many times that amount if they hadhad the space — and turned back towards Cairo. During the next few days, as theyexamined their find, Clayton and Spencer began to realise just how strange itwas. To begin with, some of the pieces had fractures that looked as if they hadbeen produced by deliberate blows; in fact, they resembled the pieces of flintfound near prehistoric hand axes. But if they were flakes, not a single tektiteresembled a Stone Age tool. A further oddity was their sheer quantity. Tektitesare fairly rare; they are not found by the hundredweight.Chemical analysis threw an unexpected light on the matter, but only to leaveanother mystery. It seemed these were not tektites after all — they were made ofthe same silicon as the desert sand. The only obvious solution was that theywere fragments that had been instantly fused by the impact of a white-hotmeteorite, and were hurled through the air like shrapnel.Further examinations of the site in the following years failed to locate anykind of crater. Moreover, one particular piece of evidence suggested that theglass had not been created by a meteor impact. One fragment about the size of alemon had a neat hole running right through it – it looked as if someone hadpoked it with a metal rod while it was still molten. Two other ‘bore holes’penetrated the glass for only a short distance. The evidence suggested that thisglass had been manufactured by human beings. Further signs suggested that theglass had been handled by human hands: for example, the few bubbles in it wereelongated, as if the glass had been turned or lifted while it was still molten.In 1933, Clayton and Spencer2 presented their evidence to the Royal GeographicalSociety in a paper. The audience included a distinguished member named FrancisJames Rennell, later Lord Rennell of Rodd, who had been a staff officer in Egyptduring the First World War and had later been involved in explorations in theSahara. Rennell, who would become President of the Royal Geographical Society in1945, became fascinated by the mystery of the Libyan Desert glass.Archaeologists had dated rock carvings in the area to about 5,500 BC. It hadgenerally been assumed that they were carved by illiterate nomads, but if theywere made by the producers of the glass, it suggested that a fairlysophisticated level of civilisation had been achieved in the area by the sixthmillennium BC.Whenever archaeologists stumble upon such anomalies, they are inclined to keepquiet about them, in case their colleagues accuse them of being too imaginative.Such was the case, for example, in the 1890s, when the great Flinders Petrieexcavated a village called Naqada, on the Nile, and found pottery and vases ofsuch sophistication that he assumed they must date from the Eleventh Dynasty,around 2,000 BC; he even coined the term ‘the New Race’ to describe this unknownpeople, whose artifacts seemed oddly unlike those of the Egyptians. But when hefound more of their typical pottery in tombs dating from 1,000 years earlier, hedecided to drop Naqada from his chronology rather than face the embarrassment ofexplaining how ‘primitives’ of an earlier civilisation could produce work ofsuch excellence.Equally problematic were the long-necked vases found in the Step Pyramid atSaqqara,3 which dates from 2,650 BC. Clay vessels can be made in any shape,because the potter can mould the inside with his hand, but what can explain avessel carved out of hard materials such as basalt, quartz or diorite? How doesthe potter carve out the inside of the vessel when the neck is too narrow toadmit even the smallest hand? We are forced back on the improbable hypothesisthat the craftsmen had some method of melting the hard rock, just as it was oncemelted in the furnace of the earth’s interior, before they blew it into shapelike glass.Lord Rennell, who had spent many years in Egypt, was intrigued by suchmysteries. He was still brooding on the Libyan Desert glass when, in the latefifties, he met Dr John R.V. Dolphin, the chief engineer of the British AtomicEnergy Authority. When Rennell told Dolphin about the glass, Dolphin repliedthat he had also seen something similar in the Australian desert, and knew justhow it had been created – by the detonation of an atomic bomb.4Dolphin gave Rennell a sample of his glass from the test site, and Rennell inturn showed Dolphin some of the Libyan Desert glass. They looked amazinglysimilar. Like the Libyan Desert glass, Dolphin’s Australian specimens containedvirtually no water, because of the tremendously high temperature at which theyhad been formed. Dolphin’s estimate was that they were produced at about 6,000degrees Celsius.It had the makings of a first-class mystery. Sherlock Holmes might have reasonedthus: Glass fragments are found over a fairly wide area even to parallelcorridors to the east and west. Since their silicon content is the same as thatof the desert sand, we know they are not tektites. We are left with the notionof a meteorite impact — yet there is no crater. The making of coloured glass wasone of the preoccupations of the alchemists, and we know that alchemy wasstudied in Graeco-Roman Egypt as well as ancient India and China. Could this bealchemical glass? Since the glass shows signs of being handled by humans, theonly possible explanation is that it is the leftover or by-product of someindustrial process. But if Dolphin was correct about the temperature at whichthe glass was made, then we seem to be assuming that the ancient Egyptians — orother men in the region — possessed something like atomic power.At that point Watson would have asked Holmes if he was feeling feverish, butthis apparently preposterous conclusion was nevertheless proposed by Dolphin andtaken seriously by Lord Rennell. After studying the Libyan Desert glass, Dolphinsuggested that for the ancient Phoenicians to have worked with temperaturesequivalent to 6,000 degrees Celsius they may have known the secret of atomicpower. He went on to suggest that the desert glass may have been formed when theatomic power got out of hand and caused an explosion.Another reason why Lord Rennell took the mystery seriously is that he himselfwas in possession of a necklace from ancient Egypt, made of virtually puregold.5 It is impossible to make pure gold by any normal metallurgical process,because of the problems of removing various impurities present in the ore.Nowadays, it can be done through a chemical process that was unknown in theancient world, although another method involves heating gold until it vaporises,like liquor in a still, then allowing it to cool, leaving behind the impurities.This again requires an immensely high temperature.If indeed the ancients had been working with some form of atomic energy, theywould have been able to produce the necessary temperature, but they would haveneeded lots of water. The same could be true if the Libyan Desert glass wassimply the by-product of some industrial process.Had the Libyan Desert always been waterless? To answer that question, Dolphincontacted another member of the Royal Geographical Society who was an expert onthe geography of the ancient world. His name was Charles Hapgood.Dolphin wrote to Hapgood early in 1957, telling him about the Libyan Desertglass and his theory that it must have been produced by some kind of atomicfission; he asked whether there had ever been any water in the Libyan Desert. Inreply, Hapgood assured him that there had been plenty of water in 6,000 BC inwhat is now the Sahara Desert. For several thousand years after the poledisplacement the Sahara was green and there were many lakes in the area wherethe Libyan Desert glass was found. Some of the Saharan rock carvings andpaintings depict cattle and herdsmen.Soon Hapgood was corresponding with Lord Rennell, too, but he expressed hisdoubts about Dolphin’s notion of atomic power. To Charles B. Hitchcock, a fellowmember of the American Geographical Society, Hapgood wrote on 1 January 1959:‘These two [Rennell and Dolphin] have provided me with practically indisputableevidence that some very ancient race (before 6,000 BC perhaps) could controltemperature at 6,000 degrees C in the refining of metals and silicates. The verystatement is enough to blow the head off the average archaeologist, but I see noway to explain away the evidence they sent me.’6Rennell and Dolphin’s observations fitted very comfortably with the conclusionsthat Hapgood was reaching through the study of the ‘maps of the ancient seakings’: that civilisation was thousands of years older than historians assume.The generally accepted view is expressed in the article on metallurgy in themost recent Encyclopaedia Britannica – man began to smelt ore to obtain metalsaround 4,000 BC. If, as Hapgood believed, man was building oceangoing ships atleast 3,000 years before that, then he was certainly technically accomplishedenough to have learned how to use metals.It so happened that Hapgood himself had seen a necklace made of pure gold, butthis had come from Mexico rather than Egypt. Moreover, Captain ArlingtonMallery, who had been the first to study the Piri Reis map, had also made someextraordinary claims about metal technology, speaking about it in the broadcastof August 1956 that had introduced Hapgood to the study of ancient maps.Mallery had excavated a number of furnaces in Ohio and Virginia, and wasconvinced that iron-smelting techniques were in use long before 4,000 BC. Duringthe Georgetown broadcast,7 Mallery made the even more astonishing claim that theBritish Museum had sent some iron tools from Egypt to a metallurgist and was‘astounded to find out that the ancient Egyptians were using powderedmetallurgy’, a process that involves heating the metal to a temperature where itvaporises, after which it condenses in the form of a powder. The Egyptiansobtained these temperatures, Mallery contended, by ‘the same processes that madeour atomic bomb possible’ – atomic fission – ‘so 5,000 years ago the Egyptianswere using the same processes that we thought we had discovered today to makethe atom bomb’. Mallery added that ‘the timing of the process agrees with thetiming of the ancient maps’ – in other words, perhaps 6,000–7,000 BC. Mallerywas also convinced that he had found gold that was 100 per cent pure.So Hapgood was already familiar with the claim, now made by Dolphin, thatprehistoric men he described as ‘Phoenicians’ had learned to create and sustaintemperatures of 6,000 degrees Celsius (which is only 2,000 degrees cooler thanthe surface of the sun). He was not prepared to concede that the answer lay inatomic power, though. Hapgood had his own theory, which came from a comment hefound in a book called Mysteries of Ancient South America (1956) by HaroldWilkins, who had written:Again, in the same country of Ecuador, on the sea-shore, close to a place calledEsmeraldas, queer relics have been found which are not only pre-Incaic, but seemeven to have preceded the old European stone age… The artifacts of this unknownnation, whose city is below the sea off Ecuador’s shores, are singular. Besidefine obsidian mirrors, carved like lenses in a way to suggest that the race hada knowledge of optics, there are queer, oblong-shaped prisms, on whose facetsare carved animals, hieroglyphics, or symbols…8Concave mirrors can, of course, be used to concentrate the sun’s rays –Archimedes devised huge metal mirrors to hold the Romans besieging Syracuse atbay in 211 BC, setting their ships ablaze. Hapgood told his correspondentCharles Hitchcock: ‘On the other hand, I am loath to accept the explanation towhich Lord Rennell finds himself pushed: that these ancient people(unidentified) had atomic power. I see another possible explanation: that theyused solar power through a system of lenses like those reportedly found off thecoast of Ecuador.’9Rennell himself was disinclined to accept the atomic power hypothesis, but heand Dolphin had no doubt that the Libyan Desert glass demonstrated the existenceof a civilisation that possessed the technology to create high temperatures inat least 6,000 BC.In November 1958, Hapgood wrote to Ion Edwards, Professor of Egyptology at theBritish Museum, to check Mallery’s claim that the ancient Egyptians possessedpowdered metallurgy; Edwards replied that there was no evidence that theEgyptians possessed anything but the simplest forms of metallurgy. Reluctantly,Hapgood was forced to abandon his hope that he had found proof for ancienttechnology, but like Rennell and Dolphin he was totally convinced that it hadexisted. Less than a year later, his discovery of the portolans in the Libraryof Congress left him in no doubt of the existence of a civilisation thatpredated even the ‘Phoenicians’ of Dolphin and Rennell.In the summer of 1995 Rand visited the Hapgood Archives at Yale University. Heand his friend Martin Schnell – who had drawn Rand’s attention to the article onthe Sphinx by Paul Roberts – arrived on the deserted campus and took rooms in anempty hall of residence. For three weeks they made their way across to theBeinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Collection immediately after breakfast, onlyleaving when it closed. It was there they found and made extensive notes on thefile on Lord Rennell and the Libyan Desert glass, as well as the correspondencethat revealed Hapgood’s ‘secret quest for Atlantis’.The following summer, another piece of the jigsaw puzzle fell into place. Randand Rose were visited by a friend named Shawn Montgomery, whom they had metearlier in the year when they went to launch When the Sky Fell in Toronto.Montgomery was making a research trip across Canada and America, talking topeople who shared his interest in ‘scientific anomalies’.10 As the three of themwere sitting at breakfast on the day he was about to leave, he began to tellthem about his visit to a scientist called Yull Brown, who was working on a newtechnology that certainly qualified as anomalous. Brown had learned how to makea mixture of hydrogen and oxygen whose properties had baffled every scientistwho had examined it. He called it Brown’s Gas. As he talked, Montgomery pulledout one of Brown’s brochures and laid it on the table, and Rand glanced throughit idly as his friend went on talking. Suddenly he stopped and stared. He waslooking at a page with a picture of a sun emitting rays, and in the centre ofthe sun was the phrase ‘6,000 degrees Celsius’.11 Rand was convinced that he hadtaken a major step towards solving the mystery of the Libyan Desert glass.Montgomery had been working with Graham Smith, who was involved in the MarshallMcLuhan Research Program at the University of Toronto, and the two had made aseries of[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_017_r1.jpg]A September 1979 Sydney, Australia, press release about Brown’s Gas puts thefigure 6,000 degrees Celsius at the centre of the page.television programmes about forgotten – or suppressed – knowledge. Brown’s Gascame high on the list of the things they wanted to investigate, so Montgomeryrang Brown in California. He found it extremely difficult to understand hisaccent, which was a curious mixture of Bulgarian and Australian, but eventuallyhe became an expert on the subject. What he learned sounded so incredible thatwhen Brown told him that there was a Brown’s Gas generator in Ottawa, he andSmith lost no time in paying a call on its owner, Professor Andrew Michrowski ofthe Planetary Association for Clean Energy (PACE).Professor Michrowski led them up to the roof, where the generator stood on atable. As the generator could sublimate metals into gases, and the smell tendedto linger in closed environments, open air was necessary. Michrowski used aspark to light the flame, which came from a small nozzle like a welding torch,and the demonstration began.Brown had told Montgomery that the flame could instantaneously poke a hole inwood or metal. Montgomery held out a large wooden spoon. There was a flurry ofyellow flame, and a small, clean hole appeared through half an inch of wood.On seeing such a demonstration, most people would assume that the flame was ashot as an oxyacetylene burner, so Montgomery was startled when ProfessorMichrowski handed him the torch and told him to feel the temperature of thenozzle a fraction of an inch from where the flame was emanating. His instincttold him not to risk it, but he did. The nozzle was merely warm.Montgomery picked up a rod of welder’s tungsten, and applied the flame to it. Itlooked as if he had lit a piece of magnesium ribbon. There was a blinding whiteflame, and the rod proceeded to vanish. It should have become too hot to hold;instead it remained at the same temperature. Even when the white flame waswithin an inch and a half of his fingers, there was no heat. He tried playingthe flame over his arm, moving it back and forth. It was hot, and would haveburned him if he had kept it still; as it was, it merely felt warm again. Theflame of a gas stove would have burned the tissue. Brown’s Gas could apparentlyburn tungsten, at somewhere around 6,000 degrees Celsius, but did little damageto flesh.During the next hour, Michrowski put the generator through its paces. He playedthe flame on a piece of brick, and the brick first of all glazed then began tomelt. They welded a piece of glass to a piece of brick, then a piece of copperto the brick, then a piece of glass to the copper, then cut holes in a firebrick – designed to withstand high temperatures – and also welded copper to it.They turned a fistful of sand into a glass ball, then welded together samples ofdissimilar metals, such as copper and bronze, and nickel and iron. Finally, theyturned various metals into molten pools.How could the flame do this without enough heat to burn flesh? Michrowski had noidea. Neither did anyone else. And that was why science had determinedly ignoredBrown’s Gas.Back in Toronto, Montgomery and Smith bought themselves a small Brown’s Gasgenerator from China, the only country that manufactured them. There were threesizes, and they could only afford the smallest – like the one they had seen atDr Michrowski’s. This was frustrating, because its flame was only the size ofthe tip of a pencil, and the operations it would carry out necessarily tookplace on a smaller scale. But it was obvious that it worked – even if it didseem to contradict the laws of nature.Who was the Bulgarian magician who had created this extraordinary machine? YullBrown’s real name was Ilya Velbov, and he was born on the stroke of midnight onEaster Eve in 1922. His disposition was religious, and he became a student in aseminary, destined for the priesthood. The question that would lead to thecreation of Brown’s Gas occurred to him when he was reading the Bible at the ageof seventeen. The Second Epistle of St Peter declares that one day the earthwill be consumed by fire. How, the young Velbov found himself wondering, could aplanet whose surface has far more sea than land be consumed by fire? Perhapswater could somehow be turned into flames?The student was also fond of the works of Jules Verne. A few weeks later hehappened to be reading one of his finest works, The Mysterious Island, writtenin 1874. And here Velbov again came upon the interesting suggestion that watermight be used as a fuel. It is a modern version of Robinson Crusoe, except ithas five main characters (six if you count Captain Nemo of Twenty ThousandLeagues Under the Sea, who appears at the end and whose death concludes volumethree with a dramatic flourish). They are wrecked on a remote island when theirballoon crashes into the sea. Verne’s aim was to show how such a group could notonly survive, but, with the help of nineteenth-century science and common sense,create themselves a small but comfortable version of civilisation.Halfway through volume two, the castaways sit around the fire on a winterevening, sipping coffee made from elderberries and discussing the problem ofwhat will happen when the world runs out of coal. ‘What will they burn insteadof coal?’ asks one of the characters. Cyrus Harding – the novel’s scientificgenius – answers, ‘Water.’ He goes on to explain:Water decomposed into its primitive elements… by electricity, which will thenhave become a powerful and manageable force… Yes, my friends, I believe thatwater will one day be employed as a fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen, whichconstitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an inexhaustible source ofheat and light… One day the engine rooms of steamers and the tenders oflocomotives will be stored with these two condensed gases, which will burn withenormous calorific power… Water will be the coal of the future.12Even the remark about electricity was an astonishing piece of propheticanticipation. We have to remember that Verne composed his novel by gaslight.Edison did not invent the electric light bulb until 1879, five years later, andit was not until 1883 that Nicola Tesla invented alternating current and made itpracticable to transmit electric current over long distances.Any scientist who read Verne’s novel would have dismissed his prophecy asnonsense. The law of the conservation of energy declares that you can only getout of a machine as much energy as you put in. If you decompose water byelectrolysis – running an electric current through it – and then recombine thehydrogen and oxygen by dropping in a match, the resulting explosion onlyproduces as much energy as you have introduced via the electrolysis. Perhaps theseminary student was unaware of this. At all events, he continued to dream ofone day turning Cyrus Harding’s dream into reality.But in the spring of 1941, Bulgaria joined the Axis Powers and declared war onBritain and the United States. Ilya Velbov found himself commanding an occupyingforce of marines on a tiny Greek island in the Aegean. After the Nazis weredefeated and the Russians had invaded Bulgaria, Brown took a degree inelectrical engineering and spent some time working in Moscow. But he hatedcommunist society, and was finally denounced to the secret police by his wife, adevout communist. He spent the next six years in a ‘hard regime’ concentrationcamp, which wrecked his health and almost killed him.But he did not die. Perhaps he was sustained by hatred. At all events, hedetermined to escape the communists. He did this by swimming the river dividingBulgaria and Turkey. As he stood shivering in his clothes on the other side ofthe border, he was arrested by Turkish border guards and thrown into jail as aspy. There he spent the next five years.Finally, with the aid of the US intelligence service – and in particular a majorcalled Brown – he was released in 1958 and allowed to emigrate to a country ofhis choice, which happened to be Australia. Since it seemed a good idea to takean English name, he chose Brown in honour of the American major, and Yullbecause he admired Yul Brynner (whose name he misspelled). He was qualified asan electrical engineer, and managed to find a job in Sydney with AustralianConsolidated Industries, where he designed and built test instruments and roseto become chief instrument officer. But he found working for a bossunsatisfying, and the work unexciting; after ten years, he resigned and set upin business for himself.This was a period when plane hijackings were in the news every day, and airportsall over the world were being forced to introduce security systems. The method,of course, was a simple metal detector, whose disadvantage was that it wouldrespond to coins or belt buckles as well as concealed weapons, obliging securityguards to examine pockets and wave metal detectors over passengers’ arms andlegs. Brown perceived, rightly, that this was a waste of money. What about asystem that would recognise guns or bombs and ignore everything else? He deviseda revolving door that had three detection systems: one for objects weighing morethan 14 ounces, one for objects the size of guns, and one for the high-carbonsteel used in pistols. It cost about 4,000 Australian dollars to install, butneither banks nor airlines were interested, favouring the old labour-intensivemethod. So Brown’s first invention found no takers.Brown turned his attention back to the idea that had occupied his mind sincethat evening in the seminary when he had read Jules Verne: turning water into afuel. As an electrical engineer, he must have understood all the scientificobjections, yet some deep intuition drove him to persist. He learned howdangerous it can be to mix hydrogen and oxygen when an accidental explosionwrecked his laboratory and almost cost him his life, but still he carried on.The basic problem is quite simple: when oxygen and hydrogen are mixed together,their natural tendency is to combine. So when water is subjected toelectrolysis, oxygen and hydrogen are placed, so to speak, in separate lockedrooms – that is, a mesh is placed between them to keep the gases apart. Thisraises the resistance in the vessel and means that any process depending on theelectrolysis of water is extremely expensive. It explains why hydrogen, which isplentiful in nature, is not used as a fuel – it is too dangerous, as themanufacturers of airships discovered. Hydrogen on its own will merely explodewith a mild plop, or burn with a gentle flame; it is only when mixed with oxygenthat it becomes dangerously explosive. The same is true of coal gas, though, andmillions of people have gas stoves.After three years of experiment, Yull Brown realised his dream of making use ofthe hydrogen in water. His major insight, it seems, was that if hydrogen andoxygen are mixed together in the same proportion as they are found in water,they ought – so to speak – to be glad to combine quietly, without a loud bang.This proved to be the case. When the two gases are recombined with a spark, theresult is not an explosion, but an implosion. That is, they combine to makewater, which occupies a far smaller volume, and if the reaction takes place in aclosed vessel also creates a vacuum. When Brown passed these gases through anozzle and lit them with the end of the cigar that was permanently between hislips, the result was an almost colourless flame that burned at a temperature ofaround 130 degrees Celsius, slightly hotter than boiling water, so that it canbe wafted up and down someone’s bare arm without any discomfort. Yet whenapplied to tungsten, which melts at 3,000 degrees Celsius, it simply vaporisesit.Obviously, something very strange is taking place. The flame is not merelyheating the material; it is reacting with it. Instead of simply heating to 130degrees Celsius, the temperature of the tungsten is soaring until it vaporises.One suggestion offered by scientists who witnessed the reaction is that perhapsBrown’s Gas keeps the oxygen and hydrogen in their atomic state, that is, assingle atoms, instead of allowing them to combine into molecules of O2 and H2.Even if that proves to be correct, it is still hard to see why a flame made ofatoms rather than molecules should make the substances to which it is appliedbehave so unaccountably.Shawn Montgomery’s reaction was that he was witnessing something akin toalchemy13 If a flame that burns at around 130 degrees Celsius can punch holes ina firebrick and vaporise tungsten, then the laws of nature are, at the veryleast, not as straightforward as we assumed. It looks as if the Brown’s Gasflame can somehow ‘take account’ of the substance it is heating, which soundsmore like medieval alchemy than the chemistry we were taught at school.The same might be said of the gas’s ability to detoxify nuclear waste, whichBrown demonstrated repeatedly. The writer Christopher Bird describes how Brownmelted a piece of radioactive Americanum 241 (made by the decay of an isotope ofplutonium) along with small pieces of steel and aluminium, on a brick. ‘After acouple of minutes under the flame, the molten metals sent up an instant flash,in what Brown says is the reaction that destroys the radioactivity’ TheAmericanum, which had originally measured 16,000 curies of radiation per minute,now showed only 100 curies per minute – about the same harmless low level asbackground radiation.At the point when it began to look as if Brown’s work was destined to beignored, he received an offer from the People’s Republic of China. The resultwas that Chinese submarines began to put to sea with Brown’s Gas generatorsinstead of huge tanks of fresh water, and Chinese scientists began disposing oftheir nuclear waste by heating with Brown’s Gas.It is impossible that Yull Brown could have been a swindler. The Chinese foundthat his gas actually worked; so did the large American corporation that builthim a laboratory, and the many people like Professor Michrovski who purchasedBrown’s Gas generators. Over the years, hundred of people have seen thedemonstrations that Shawn Montgomery witnessed, such as the gas burning a holein a firebrick or vaporising tungsten.One possible solution to the mystery may lie in the fact that when Brown’s Gasburns it implodes. An oxyacetylene flame is, in effect, a controlled explosion.The same is true of welding torches that use hydrogen gas in place of acetylene.When oxygen and hydrogen combine in exactly the same proportions as in water,they create almost no heat, and when the flame is applied to some substance liketungsten, it looks as if the oxygen and hydrogen enter into chemical reactionwith the tungsten, aided by the heat of the flame. It is also possible, as hasbeen suggested, that the flame consists of atoms of oxygen and hydrogen ratherthan molecules, and that their ‘combinatory capacity’ is therefore increased.An ordinary flame burns by heating the substance until its elements dissociate,which is what happens when you apply a match to a piece of paper. On the otherhand, if you mix sulphur and iron filings then heat them over a flame in a metaltray, the sulphur will melt and turn brown, then begin to fizz and bubblefuriously. You can remove the heat, and the reaction will continue until,instead of sulphur and iron, you have a solid lump of iron sulphide. Again, ifsulphur dioxide and oxygen are passed over heated platinised asbestos, theycombine to form sulphur trioxide, which, when dissolved in water, makessulphuric acid. The platinised asbestos is a catalyst – that is, it is notchanged by the reaction. This sounds like ‘alchemy’ – certainly the kind ofalchemy that takes place when tungsten vaporises when heated with a mere130-degree flame.In other words, Brown’s Gas may simply cause the tungsten, firebrick, gold oreor radioactive waste to react like the sulphur and iron filings, combining in anessentially chemical reaction, as straightforward as dropping a piece of zincinto hydrochloric acid and watching it dissolve. If so, the essence of Brown’sGas is simply that it causes chemical reactions. This would also explain why itis possible to hold one end of a piece of tungsten as it ‘burns’. This wouldsuggest that Yull Brown was not being accurate when he made the statement thatBrown’s Gas can create a temperature of 6,000 degrees Celsius. When a Californiacompany named Diversified Inspections measured what happened when Brown’s Gasvaporised tungsten, the inspector handling the optical measuring device waspuzzled when it read ‘a measurement far lower than the boiling point of thatmetal’. In his four-part article on Brown’s Gas in Raum und Zeit, ChristopherBird seems to assume that this is a mistake. He says that, when a furtherreading was taken, using a new measuring instrument, 6,000 degrees Celsius wasrecorded, although Diversified Inspections declined to offer a certificate tothis effect. It seems conceivable that this is because the measuring device didnot register 6,000 degrees Celsius.Bird goes on to record that when the temperature of the ‘implosion’ inside acylinder was taken, it was a mere 4.3 degrees Celsius. The fact that ShawnMontgomery could continue to hold the tungsten rod as it was ‘burning’ seems tomake it highly likely that Brown’s Gas reactions do not take place at hightemperatures.So perhaps the ancients knew the secret of Brown’s Gas. Various clues point inthis direction. In June 1936, a German archaeologist named William König, fromthe Iraq Museum in Baghdad, was opening a Parthian grave when he came upon aclay vase that contained a copper cylinder, inside which was an iron rod held inplace by asphalt and molten lead. It looked to König like a primitive battery;fellow archaeologists disputed this, since the grave was dated to about 250 BC.But Dr Arne Eggebrecht constructed a duplicate, and poured fruit juice into it;the result was a half-volt current that lasted for eighteen days, with which hewas able to coat a silver figurine in gold in half an hour. Having observed thaton many gold-covered Egyptian statues the gold seemed to be too fine to havebeen glued or beaten on, he had become convinced that the ancient Egyptians knewthe secret of electroplating.When Colonel Howard-Vyse was exploring the Great Pyramid in 1837, he instructedone of his assistants, J. R. Hill, to unblock the end of the southern ‘airshaft’ from the King’s Chamber with gunpowder. Hill found an iron plate, 1 footlong, 4 inches wide and an eighth of an inch thick, embedded in the masonry ofthe pyramid. Re-examined at the Mineral Resources Department of ImperialCollege, London, in 1989, it was found to be iron that had been smelted at over1,000 degrees Celsius. The ancient Egyptians were not supposed to understand theprocesses of smelting iron – all their iron ore came from deposits left bymeteorites. But the plate was not meteorite iron – it contained too much nickel.It would seem that the Egyptians knew about smelting iron ore two thousand yearsbefore the iron age. Oddly enough, traces of gold were found on one side of theiron plate, indicating that it had been gold-plated. Of course, the gold mayhave been beaten on, but if Eggebrecht was correct about his statues, the platemay have been electroplated.No one has ever satisfactorily explained what the decorators of the walls ofEgyptian tombs used as a light source as they worked. There is no sign oflampblack on the ceilings. The explanation may, of course, be simple: that theywent to some trouble to clean off any carbon. On the other hand, engravings onthe walls of the temple at Dendera seem to depict electric lights andinsulators…If the Egyptians had possessed a technology even as rudimentary as the Baghdadbattery, they could have been able to dissociate the hydrogen and oxygen inwater by electrolysis, and could have possessed the knowledge to create Brown’sGas.When Shawn Montgomery interviewed Yull Brown in April 1996, Brown told him thatthe Aztecs had a means of producing Brown’s Gas. Using a particular mixture ofwet wood and dry wood, they set it alight to produce a high temperature thatcaused the imprisoned steam to dissociate and become Brown’s Gas. It would, ofcourse, implode, but this implosion could cause gold ore – presumably alsotrapped in the burning wood – to yield up ten times as much gold as in thenormal separation process. According to Brown: ‘They were producing a lot ofgold. A lot of gold. But they couldn’t have produced that much gold from theamount of ore that they were producing. I was experimenting with this matter,and I found out why. Now with Brown’s Gas you can produce ten times more goldwith the same amount of ore.’Montgomery asked if Brown had done this himself.15 Brown replied, ‘Oh yes. Thereare even some Mayans who use this in the production of gold. They have examinedit, and done the lab work, and conclude that this works. Not only gold, butplatinum, silver and so on.’ When we recall Lord Rennell’s pure gold necklace,and the pure gold necklace from Mexico seen by Hapgood, it is natural to wonderwhether these might have been produced using Brown’s Gas.Montgomery also asked if there was any way of using Brown’s Gas to maketektites, and again Brown replies in the affirmative: ‘I have already sent twoBrown’s Gas machines to Texas Instruments to purify silica to make siliconchips. If you put any gas that has a hydrocarbon product to melt the silica,carbon contaminates and destroys the pure crystalline structure of the chip… Butwith Brown’s Gas it melts the silica and leaves only water, which is near to thecrystallisation and creates only an ideal crystal. This gives a superior highspeed chip and also a good solar cell.’Montgomery found himself speculating on the notion of a huge sheet of purifiedsilicon in a sunny environment – perhaps the Libyan Desert – producing vastquantities of cheap electricity, although this is different from Libyan Desertglass, which looks as if it has been made in an atomic explosion.There are other clues. In the spring of 1997, I was in Mexico, making atelevision documentary based on my book From Atlantis to the Sphinx. We spent aday at the ancient sacred site of Tula (once called Tollan), 50 miles north ofMexico City. This was once the capital of the Toltecs, the predecessors of theAztecs, whose empire flourished from about AD 700 to 900 (although their originscan be traced back to the pre-Christian era). According to legend, Tollan issignificant as the site of the final battle between two gods, Quetzalcoatl andTezcatlipoca, usually identified as the forces of good and evil (although theToltecs would have felt that is an oversimplification). Quetzalcoatl, who isidentified with Viracocha, Kon Tiki, Votan and other gods of Central and SouthAmerica, is the white god who came from the east during some remote epoch. InFrom Atlantis to the Sphinx, I cited the views of the nineteenth-century scholarBrasseur de Bourberg, who believed that Quetzalcoatl was an Atlantis survivorwho brought with him the arts of civilisation. The legend records that he wasfinally defeated by Tezcatlipoca, the ‘Lord of the Smoking Mirror’ (which, likesome magic crystal, conferred visions of distant places), and sailed away on araft with a promise that he would one day return.I had also been greatly intrigued by a passage in Graham Hancock’s Fingerprintsof the Gods, which speaks of the curious objects held by the four great statuesof Tula. These stone figures, 16 feet tall, stand on a platform at the top of atruncated pyramid, the Temple of the Morning Star, and once supported thetemple’s wooden roof. In 1880 the discoverer of the sacred site, the Frenchexplorer Desiré Charnay, found blocks of black basalt that he thought were thefeet of giant statues, which he called Atlanteans (‘Atlantes’) The four greatstatues of Tula were in fact discovered sixty years later, and the name wastransferred to them.What is significant about these statues is that they hold unidentifiable objectsin their hands, which are pressed flat against their sides. The object on theright-hand side looks at first like a Western gunfighter’s six-shooter in itsholster, but the handle by which the object is held, by two fingers, looks morelike the handle of some power-tool. In the left hand there is something thatscholars have described as a bunch of arrows and an incense bag, but since theparallel strands are curved it seems unlikely that they are arrows. GrahamHancock remarks that he had the feeling that the original devices were made outof metal.On our return home further examination of photographs we took of these statuesfailed to yield any more clues to the purpose of these objects. It was certainlyimpossible to see how they might have been used as atl-atls, or spear-throwers,as many of the guidebooks state.Shawn Montgomery later drew my attention to a passage about Tula in a book byZecharia Sitchin, The Lost Realms (1990),16 the fourth volume of his EarthChronicles series. Among respectable scholars, Sitchin’s name is not one toconjure with, for he is often associated with Erich von Däniken as someone whobelieves that the earth was once colonised by visitors from outer space. ButSitchin differs from Däniken in an important respect: the soundness of hisscholarship. Whether or not we find his theories tenable, he is an endless mineof information. And in The Lost Realms he discusses the statues of Tollan andpoints out that one of the pilasters has a peculiar carving of a man wearing asegmented suit, with what looks like a kind of backpack. In his hands he isholding the same tool – the one that resembles a pistol in its holster – and ispointing it at the rock face in front of him; a surging flame is bursting out ofthe barrel of the ‘pistol’. Sitchin says he ‘uses it as a flame thrower to shapea stone’.Whether or not we dismiss Sitchin’s theories as too farfetched, the fact remainsthat the strange objects held by the gods of Tollan are devices from whichcurving tongues of flame issue forth, and that Brown’s Gas could have been usedfor this purpose. It would seem that the Toltecs must have either possessed sometechnology, or at least known enough about it to ascribe it to their gods. Mostgods in world mythology can hurl thunderbolts, but they are not depicted holdingsome kind of flame-spitting welding torch in their hands.Sitchin has further interesting observations on Tollan. The pyramid wasexcavated again in the 1940s by the archaeologist Jorge Acosta, who alsoexcavated Teotihuacan. It was Acosta who found a deep trench inside the pyramid,containing the 16-foot Atlanteans’ whose giant ‘feet’ had been found by Charnayin 1880. There were also four columns that had once stood in the corners of theroof.An earlier pyramid lay under this Temple of the Morning Star. The site containedthe remains of inner chambers and passages, which have still not been explored,and a carved stone pipe, made of sections that fitted together, with a diameterof about 18 inches. It was positioned at the same angle as the pyramid’s walls,and ran throughout its whole height.Acosta assumed it had been intended to drain water, but, as Sitchin asks, whycarve an elaborate stone pipe when a clay pipe would do just as well? The stonepipe was obviously part of the structure of the pyramid, and had a particularpurpose. Sitchin says: ‘The fact that the remains of the adjoiningmulti-chambered and multistoreyed buildings suggest some industrial processing,and also the fact that in antiquity, water from the Tula river was channelled toflow by these buildings, raise the possibility that at this site, as atTeotihuacan, some kind of purification and refining process had taken place at avery early period.’ Such observations inevitably recall the speculations of JohnDolphin and Lord Rennell about the possibility that the Libyan Desert glass wasa by-product of some industrial process. Sitchin goes even further: ‘Was theenigmatic tool a tool not to engrave stones, but to break up stones for theirores? Was it, in other words, a sophisticated mining tool? And was the mineralsought after gold?’Sitchin argues that the space visitors wished to mine earth for preciousminerals, the most important being gold, which they needed for scientificpurposes. He quotes reports of the Anglo-American Corporation, who engagedarchaeologists to study ancient mines, to the effect that ‘mining technology wasused in southern Africa during much of the period subsequent to 100,000 BC ’,and he points out that although gold was obtained in Peru and Mexico by panningin streams, ‘this could in no way account for the immense treasures’ of thesecountries. He quotes a Spanish chronicler to the effect that the Spaniardsextracted from the Incas alone 6 million ounces of gold and 20 million ounces ofsilver annually. He believes, as did Yull Brown, that they had some far moreefficient method of extracting precious metals from the ore.He went on to point out that the four Atlanteans’ holding up the roof of theTemple of the Morning Star bring to mind the ancient Egyptian belief that thefour sons of Horus hold up the sky at four cardinal points. These same four godswould accompany the deceased pharaoh up a ‘Stairway to Heaven’, depicted inhieroglyphs as a kind of step pyramid. This same step pyramid symbol, whichdecorates the walls around the Tollan pyramid, also became a major symbol forthe Aztecs, who came after the Toltecs. Sitchin also suggests a connectionbetween the ‘feathered serpent’, Quetzalcoatl, and the Egyptian winged serpentthat helps transport the deceased pharaoh heavenward. One of Sitchin’s basictheses is that there is a close connection between the gods of ancient Egypt andthe gods of Mexico.On checking with Rand, I learned that Tula is located on exactly the samelongitude as the more ancient site of Teotihuacan, emphasising again that thesites of sacred places seemed to be carefully selected, not chosen at random.I was offered another clue to a possible connection between Egypt and Mexico aswe made the same television programme. We drove from La Paz, Bolivia, across theimmense plain called the Altiplano, to the ancient city of Tiahuanaco in theAndes. The sacred ruins are 2.5 miles above sea level although Tiahuanaco wasonce a port on nearby Lake Titicaca before some geological upheaval tilted theground and caused the lake to move a dozen miles away.Little remains of the great port now, except for the ruins of the port area, thePuma Punku (Puma Gate), where giant blocks lay scattered like ninepins; one hasa long incision cut by a blade that seems to have been made with adiamond-tipped saw.A few hundred yards away are the remains of a large temple enclosure called theKalasasaya. In its north-western corner stands the most famous feature ofTiahuanaco, the Gateway of the Sun, which looks like a miniature Arc deTriomphe. The lintel of the gateway has a crack that runs down to the ‘doorway’in its centre, but before the twentieth century it was more than just a crack:photographs in Professor Arthur Posnansky’s classic work Tiahauanacu: The Cradleof American Man (1915) show it literally torn in two, most probably by someconvulsion of the earth.As I wandered around Tiahuanaco, I was struck by the precision of theworkmanship. Massive blocks of stone, many weighing more than 100 tons, werecarved with such exactitude that a knife could not be inserted between theblocks. Where blocks had been separated, as in the Puma Punku, it could be seenthat they were often joined by metal clamps, obviously to prevent them comingapart in an earthquake. The archaeo-astronomer Professor Neil Steede, who wasinvolved with the same TV programme, examined one of these clamps, roughly 6inches long and shaped like a capital I, and remarked that the builders musthave possessed some kind of portable forge – microscopic examination has shownthat the metal was poured into position when hot. No signs of any such portableforge have ever been found, and an open fire would not have been hot enough tomelt the metal for these clamps. Also, there are few trees on the Altiplano toprovide the fuel.Shawn Montgomery’s account of the Brown’s Gas flame creating a pool of moltenmetal within seconds reminded me of the metal clamps of Tiahuanaco. Rand andShawn had, early in their discussions, wondered whether they had been melted ina ‘portable forge’, as Steede suggested, or by some device more like the‘blowtorch’ seen on the pilaster at Tula.The next sequence of the programme took me to Egypt, at the Giza site. Fiftyyards from the Menkaura pyramid I was filmed examining a wall of preciselycarved blocks and pointing out that in Egypt such blocks have been found to bejoined by metal clamps. As Graham Hancock has pointed out, they are also foundin Angkor Wat, in Cambodia.Tiahuanaco has one more feature that raises some of the same questions as Tula:a pyramid known as the Akapana, which was once a vast step pyramid with seventerraces and a flat top, looking rather like some industrial complex or perhapsa modernist building. It had once dominated the temple area, but 90 per cent ofits flat facing stones have been removed over the years by builders, so thatwhat remains looks at first glance like a natural hill. Anyone who clambers tothe top finds that it contains a kind of lake.But it was not a hill. Inside, as in the Tollan pyramid, there are tunnels and achamber of unknown purpose, which a Bolivian archaeologist, Oswaldo Rivera, hasdescribed as its ‘King’s Chamber’. Jointed stone channels had carried water, andit had been surrounded by a moat. The large quantities of water that would havefallen on top of the pyramid ran into the central court – what now looks like alake – then into a drainage system that probably ran around all four sides ofthe first terrace, to be allowed to emerge into the open, then conducted backinside again, then out, all the way to the moat. The top was covered with greenpebbles looking like the water of the ‘lake’. The whole building was a monumentto water. We are reminded of Sitchin’s words about Tula, and ‘the remains of theadjoining multichambered and multistoried buildings’ that ‘suggest someindustrial processing, and… raise the possibility that at this site, as atTeotihuacan, some kind of purification and refining process had taken place at avery early period’.As I stood on top of the Akapana pyramid, looking south towards the QuimsachataMountains, then at the vast plain that extended all around me, I found myselftrying to imagine what this place had looked like when Tiahuanaco was at theheight of its prosperity. It was difficult to imagine a huge city with a portarea and buildings constructed of immense blocks, some weighing nearly 200 tons.How did they get them here? And what was a city doing in the middle of thisrather soggy plain? Then what had happened? It seemed that some greatcatastrophe had turned it into this barren plain. And when had it occurred?According to the museum opposite the Kalasasaya, and to Alan L. Kolata’s bookThe Tiwanaku17 (the spelling of the city’s name varies), Tiahuanaco rose topower around AD 100, reached its peak around AD 500, then went into steadydecline until about AD 1000. What was the tremendous cataclysm that snapped theGateway of the Sun in two, and hurled the huge stones of the port all over theplace? It was obviously more than a local earthquake, but there is no record ofsuch a cataclysm around 500 AD.Around the turn of the twentieth century Professor Arthur Posnansky, who spenthis life studying the ruins, concluded that Tiahuanaco was founded about 15,000BC. His reasoning was based on two observation points in the enclosure, whichmarked the summer and winter solstices. At the moment, the two tropics arelocated 23 degrees, 30 minutes on either side of the equator, but when theKalasasaya was built, the tropics were slightly closer to the equator — to beexact, at 23 degrees, 8 minutes and 48 seconds. This change in the width of thetropics results from a slight rolling motion of the earth known as the obliquityof the ecliptic, and it enabled Posnansky to calculate when the Kalasasaya wasbuilt.Posnansky’s dating upset scholars, who felt it was thousands of years too early,but between 1927 and 1930 a team of German scientists, led by Dr Hans Ludendorffof Potsdam, checked Posnansky’s results and were inclined to agree with him. Theacademic furore led them to revise their figure downward, and they ended bysuggesting that Tiahuanaco might date from 9,300 BC, but even this struckarchaeologists and historians as 9,000 years too early. This view, as we haveseen, prevails today.Yet not entirely. The archaeologist Professor Neil Steede, who studiedTiahuanaco for many years, concluded the sacred city was built about 12,000years ago.* And, more surprisingly, so does Dr Oswaldo Rivera, the Director ofthe Bolivian National Institute of Archaeology, who conducted excavations atTiahuanaco for twenty-one years. In a television programme called The MysteriousOrigins of Man,18 made in 1996, Rivera had gone on record as disagreeing withSteede’s estimate. His own view was that the builders of Tiahuanaco had simplymade a slight mistake — after all, we are only speaking of about 21 seconds of adegree. Steede disagreed emphatically; he felt that builders as accurate as thefounders of Tiahuanaco would not have made even such a minor error.During the remainder of 1996, Rivera went on to observe the sunsets overTiahuanaco, which involved the taking of measurements from the other end of theKalasasaya. His calculations finally convinced him that Steede was right – therewas no ‘minor error’. The measurements of the sunsets gave precisely the samereading as the sunrises. Rivera came to agree that the Kalasasaya was builtapproximately 12,000 years ago, near the time Atlantis fell.*Using Posnansky’s methodology but armed with better instruments, Steedeestablished a more reliable date."},{"pageContent":"6ANCIENT VOYAGERSIN THE EARLY 1930s, the United Fruit Company began clearing the jungles ofsouth-western Costa Rica, in Central America, to make a banana plantation in thearea called the Diquis Delta. The workers hacking and burning their way throughjungle began to find huge stone hemispheres sticking up out of the earth, andsome hard digging revealed that they were spheres, like giant beachballs –except that they were made of granite. The largest was over 9 feet in diameter,the smallest the size of a tennis ball. It seemed that the spheres had onceformed part of various religious sites: they had been supported on top ofmounds, and were surrounded by stelae and statues. What was so astonishing wasthe perfect workmanship; many were exact spheres, and their surface was assmooth as paper.While giant stone balls are certainly an oddity, something about them quicklyexhausts one’s curiosity. Some of the wealthier inhabitants of San José andLimon, Costa Rica’s major cities, had them transported on to their front lawns,and learned in the process that the largest weighed 20 tons. A fewarchaeologists looked at them, shook their heads, and opined that they probablyrepresented either the sun or the moon, or perhaps both, and turned theirattention elsewhere.About a decade later, an American archaeologist called Samuel K. Lothrop wasspending a brief vacation in the Diquis area with his wife when he saw one ofthe balls on a lawn in Palmar Sur; he was told that there were hundreds of them,and that no one had any idea of what they were. Here was a puzzle worth solving.Since Lothrop happened to have time on his hands – bandits were making itdifficult to continue his current task of excavating the pottery of the Chortega– he decided to devote some time to this intriguing problem.He made little headway, for a smooth stone ball is devoid of clues, but at leasthe visited the site where some of the balls had been left in place and notedthat they often seemed to be found in threes, in the form of a triangle. Othersoccurred in straight lines consisting of as many as forty-five spheres. But thetriangles were oddly irregular, and were often made of balls of differing sizes,which suggested a special purpose in their arrangement, some hidden code thatremained impossible to fathom. Lothrop wrote a paper on the stone balls, whichwas published under the auspices of the Peabody Institute at Harvard, andreturned to less impenetrable mysteries. No other archaeologist pursued thesubject, for Lothrop seemed to have exhausted it in his brief paper.Three decades passed, and the stone spheres seemed to have been forgotten. Then,in 1981, Ivar Zapp, a young Professor of Architecture at the University of CostaRica, thought he saw a new approach to the mystery. His inspiration came fromthe work of an English scholar, John Michell, whose name had become associatedwith ‘ley lines’ – long, straight tracks that run like canals across the Englishcountryside. Zapp recalled the long, straight lines of stone spheres in theDiquis Delta, and began to speculate…1Ley lines had been ‘discovered’ in 1921 by an English businessman named AlfredWatkins, who was riding his horse across the hills near Bredwardine, inHerefordshire, when he noticed that ancient footpaths ran straight as an arrowfor mile after mile, often towards hilltops. It suddenly struck him that Englandseems to be criss-crossed with hundreds of these ‘old straight tracks’. Hecalled them ‘leys’ or ‘leas’, and concluded that they were ancient trade routesused by the earliest inhabitants of Britain.2When John Michell approached the problem in the mid-1960s, it was largelybecause he was fascinated by the mystery of flying saucers, which had beencausing excitement ever since a businessman named Kenneth Arnold had seen aformation of them flying at tremendous speed near Mount Rainier in WashingtonState in 1947. Subsequently there had been thousands of sightings.Michell noted the curious fact that many flying saucers were seen close to leylines, which are obviously more easily seen from the air than the ground, andespecially at the crossing points of several leys. Learning that the Chinesehave similar lines called lung mei, or dragon paths, which are designed tochannel the ‘magic energies of heaven and earth’, Michell speculated that leylines may mark some current of ‘earth-force’. He learned that dowsers, forexample, can detect ley lines by the response of their dowsing rods orpendulums, and noted that ley lines often pass through ‘holy’ sites, such asburial mounds, old churches, and ancient monuments like Stonehenge.Ivar Zapp could see that the stone balls of the Diquis Delta seemed to pose someof the same questions as the megaliths of Stonehenge – or, for that matter, thehuge stones of the Great Pyramid. How were they carved so perfectly? How werethey moved? Some of them were even found high in the mountains along the coastof Costa Rica, and it was impossible to imagine even a large team of men rollingthem uphill – it would be too difficult and dangerous.Zapp took a party of students to the Diquis Delta to try to fathom the mysteryof the spheres. They were baffled, but he began to see a gleam of light. Lothrophad left diagrams of what many of the original stones had looked like beforethey were moved to museums and front lawns, and Zapp noted that two groupsseemed to be arranged on either side of a straight line that pointed directly atthe magnetic North Pole. In that case, he wondered, was it possible that theother sides of the triangles were directed towards points on the earth?When he tried out this theory on a map, extending the lines with a ruler, theresult was disappointing. The lines seemed to point at nothing in particular,although that could be explained by the fact that a map is a flat projection ofthe curved surface of the earth. Zapp tried again, this time with a tape measureand a globe. One line, projected from Palmar Sur, where spheres had been found,went straight through Cocos Island, then through the Galapagos Islands, then toEaster Island. He recalled that similar spheres had been discovered on EasterIsland, although they were smaller than the giant balls of Costa Rica.When he looked more closely at this ‘sight line’ from Palmar Sur to EasterIsland, he saw that the line actually missed Easter Island by 42 miles. Then heremembered that Polynesian sailors can detect the presence of an island up to 70miles away by studying the waves and the clouds, for both are disturbed by thepresence of land; sailors also note the presence of land-based birds such as thetern and the noddy. A 7,000-mile-long sight line, passing through two otherislands, that missed Easter Island by only 42 miles would be regarded as a hit.His observations received confirmation as he studied other sight lines. Anotherside of the same triangle extended across the Atlantic and led to the Straits ofGibraltar. In another group of stones the line led to the Great Pyramid. And inyet another, it not only pointed to southern England, but ran right throughStonehenge. That could hardly be chance.It seemed that Ivar Zapp had discovered the purpose of the stone balls of CostaRica: they were navigational aids. That explained why some were in straightlines, and some were in the mountains overlooking the sea, and also why more ofthe stone balls had been found on the island of Cano, off the south coast ofCosta Rica, looking across the Pacific.Lothrop had also noted that the balls were often found in association withnative cemeteries, which led to the speculation that they might be some kind ofhomage to the dead, although it makes sense for direction markers to be found insuch locations, since the sailors would hope for guidance from the spirits ofdead navigators.The question of when the spheres were carved remains a matter for debate.Archaeological finds in the Diquis Delta date from 12,000 BC to AD 500. Somearchaeologists date the stone balls to the most recent period, between a fewcenturies BC and AD 500. Archaeologists tend to be conservative, and extremecaution in dating a new find is a way of showing that you are a sober andrespectable member of the academic community, not likely to leap to wildconclusions. This can be a mistake. In the 1920s, when the Meso-Americanarchaeologist Matthew W. Stirling found an immense negroid head at Tres Zapotesin Mexico, he suggested that the Olmec culture that carved it might be dated asearly as 600 BC, and was greeted with hoots of derision from his academiccolleagues. Stirling was, in fact, too conservative, and the Zapotec culture isnow known to date from 1,200 BC. So it is also possible that the giant stoneballs are another proof of Hapgood’s ‘worldwide maritime civilisation’ of 7,000BC.Zapp knew Hapgood’s Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, and was perfectly aware ofhis hypothesis. A student named Humberto Carro noted that the story of Sinbadthe Sailor in The Arabian Nights had a description of a steering device called akamal, a long knotted cord with wooden squares at either end, the knotsrepresenting the latitudes of various ports. The Arab navigator would hold acertain knot between his teeth and point the string at the Pole Star todetermine the ship’s position.[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_018_r1.jpg]The kamal, a steering device consisting of a long, knotted cord with woodensquares at either end.Zapp had seen this knotted string before, on a small figure Lothrop had foundnear a group of stone balls. It was holding the ends of the string in eitherhand and its centre was in its mouth, creating a V shape. Zapp had seen similarfigures from places all over the world, from pottery designs in pre-Inca burialsites in Peru to depictions in the Indus Valley in India.Costa Rica is, of course, a navigator’s culture, since it is on one of thenarrowest parts of Central America, with two vast oceans on either side.Humberto Carro came upon another interesting piece of evidence, an article byThor Heyerdahl that explained the techniques of sailing balsa rafts against thewind and current. Thousands of years before the keel was invented, Peruviansused removable centre-boards that served as keels and enabled them to tack. Inthe sixteenth century, Francisco Pizarro had encountered a whole flotilla ofsuch rafts off the coast of Peru. They were of enormous size and moving towardsthem against the wind and current. Pizarro learned that they made journeys onthese rafts along the whole coast of South America. Heyerdahl, we recall, used asimilar raft called Kon-Tiki 3 to prove that ancient mariners could have crossedthe Pacific; later on, he reinforced the point by crossing the Atlantic fromEgypt to America.When Christopher Columbus landed in Costa Rica in 1502, on his fourth voyageacross the Atlantic, the explorers were received with great respect by thenatives, and taken on a two-hour trek to the grave of an important person, whichwas decorated with the prow of a ship. The natives of Costa Rica appeared to beintroducing these great navigators from Spain to one of their own famousnavigators. The stone lapidas, or funeral slabs, upon which the dead man waslaid out looked like the centre-boards of the Peruvian balsa rafts, and otherfigures – who seemed to be priests and kings – were laid out on identicalcentre-boards, stone replicas of the boards that played such an important partin their lives.Could primitive navigators have sailed such enormous distances? Heyerdahl seemedto have proved the point, but he knew Easter Island was there when he set off.Would central American sailors of – let us say – 5,000 BC even have known of itsexistence? And even if they had, would they have dared to launch a balsa raftinto the vast and empty Pacific Ocean?Zapp came upon a book that answered his question: We, The Navigators by DavidLewis, published in 1972,4 in which Lewis described sailing with nativeislanders on native craft all over the Pacific, over 13,000 nautical miles. Theislanders used the ocean lore they had learned from their forefathers. Lewisalso described ‘sighting stones’ throughout the Pacific – he personally saw thesighting stones of Tonga and the Gilbert Islands. Unlike the stone balls ofCosta Rica, these were flat slabs of coral (which you might expect from islandswith plenty of coral), and they were also set in groups of three, which Lewissaid were intended to ‘indicate the bearings of islands’. The stones had anotheruse. The eldest child of each family was taught to use them to learn starpatterns. They learned by heart the various stars that aligned themselves withthe ‘stones’ at various times of the year, and continued to do this over alifetime, passing the knowledge on to their own children. Navigation came asnaturally to these seafaring peoples as reading a road atlas does to a modernmotorist.Zapp noted the similarities between Meso-American, Polynesian and Greekastronomy. Zapp knew that ‘atl’ is not a Greek syllable, but that it comes fromthe Mayan and Nahuatl languages of Central America and means ‘water’. Atlahuacwas the patron god of Tenochtitlan, the city the Aztecs built on a lake – nowcalled Mexico City. Plato’s sunken civilisation was called Atlantis, and itsmajor city was circular and ringed with canals, like some of the ancient citiesof Central America. Was it possible that Atlantis was actually America? This isthe startling argument that Ivar Zapp and his co-author George Erikson presentin their book Atlantis in America (1998).5They point out that there have been many theories about the location ofAtlantis: in the Mediterranean, in the North Sea, in the Atlantic near theCanaries, and in Antarctica. The latter, they argue, is the likeliest amongthese candidates, for the others are too small to fit Plato’s description. Butit cannot be Antarctica, they insist, because Plato described Atlantis as‘favoured by the sun’ – semi-tropical – and this hardly fits Antarctica. (Theyhad not taken into account Hapgood’s hypothesis that Antarctica was once muchfurther north.)Zapp and Erikson also believe that the Atlantis catastrophe was caused by acomet or asteroid, about 5 miles across, which landed in the Caribbean in 10,513BC and sent a great tidal wave thundering across Central America – the heart oftheir Atlantis’ – from ocean to ocean, leaving behind folk memories ofcatastrophe. (In Uriel’s Machine, Robert Lomas and Christopher Knight point outthat the vast salt plains of Utah are made of sea salt, as is the lake afterwhich Salt Lake City is named, which suggests that an immense tidal wave fromthe Pacific, perhaps 3 miles high, was responsible.)6At the beginning of the twentieth century, American archaeologists would havedismissed the idea of folk memories on the grounds that there were no humanbeings in America at that time. The most influential anthropologist, AlesHrdlicka of the National Museum, was totally convinced that man had arrived inAmerica about 3,000 BC. The general idea that hunters came across the landbridge that once existed between Russia and Alaska across the Bering Strait isstill the main theory of modern anthropology, but modern geological studies,Zapp points out, have revealed that ‘Beringia’ was a desert, devoid ofvegetation. Since it was also 600 miles wide, there is no possible reason toassume that Asian hunters decided to cross it to reach an equally barren Alaska.In 1927, the skeleton of a long-haired bison with a spear point lodged betweenits ribs was found in New Mexico. Since these bison became extinct more than10,000 years ago, Hrdlicka’s theory was placed under question. In 1932,archaeologists found more spear tips lodged in mammoth bones near Clovis, NewMexico, after which ‘Clovis man’ was regarded as the first human being inAmerica, dated to around 10,000 BC.7There is an immense amount of evidence for contact between America andcivilisations of the Far East. Joseph Needham, the author of the monumentalScience and Civilisation in China,8 describing a visit to Mexico City in 1947,noted the ‘palpable similarities between many features of the high CentralAmerican civilisations and those of East and South-east Asia’. He then offeredtwo dozen or so particular points of resemblance, including pyramids,double-headed serpents, dresses made of feathers and jade beads placed in themouths of the dead. Needham claims that a mountain of evidence has accumulatedof visits by Asian people to America from the seventh century BC, although GrantKeddie, a curator of the Royal British Columbia Museum in Canada, believes thatAsians established trading posts around the North Pacific rim 5,000 years ago.9In the early 1960s, Emilio Estrada, an Ecuadorian businessman who was also anamateur archaeologist, read a book on Japanese archaeology and was impressed bysimilarities between Japanese pottery from the Jomon period (about 3,000 BC) andancient potsherds he had dug up near Valdivia, on the coast of Ecuador. Hepassed on his observation to Betty Meggars, of the Smithsonian Institution, butshe was unimpressed — until she went to Japan in 1963 and saw 5,000-year-oldJapanese pottery found on the island of Kyushu. She became convinced that thesimilarities of design could not be coincidence.Her own explanation was that a fishing boat from Kyushu had been blown across toEcuador by a typhoon, and that the Japanese had taught the native Indians tomake ceramics. She was upset that most archaeologists rejected her theory on thegrounds that the fishermen would have starved to death on a voyage of more than8,000 miles. The archaeologists were right, of course — the voyagers would haveneeded supplies on board, probably more than Columbus needed to cross theAtlantic. It is unlikely that such a journey was made by chance. Ivar Zapp’sCosta Rican mariners could have managed it, though.One of the most remarkable of the advocates of the spread of Asian culture toAmerica is David Kelley, an archaeologist who, before his retirement, was on thefaculty of the University of Calgary. Kelley is an expert on the Maya, who — aswe have seen — are still revered for the incredible precision of their calendar.The first calendar in general use was the moon itself. In 1962, a scholar fromthe Peabody Museum named Alexander Marshack studied under a magnifying glass abone about 35,000 years old. It had a curious series of markings made by ourancestor — small holes engraved in the bone with a point. It looked like adecorative pattern, except the holes had been made at different times. Marshackrealised that he was looking at the earliest known calendar, and that it showedthe phases of the moon.10The Greeks had based their calendar on the moon, which takes approximately 29.5days to revolve around the earth.They had soon encountered a major problem: 12 times 19.5 only equals 354 days,which is 11.25 days short of the year. With a calendar running as fast as this,it only took sixteen years for Midsummer Day to arrive in the middle of winter.Any Greek farmer who tried to regulate his planting by the famous Works and Daysof the farmer-poet Hesiod, who lived around 800 BC, would soon have foundhimself hopelessly confused.Even the Sumerians had been unable to solve the problem. Although they dividedthe day into 24 hours, and the hours into 60 minutes, they were still unable toget the year right. They added half a day to each lunar month, making it 30days, bringing the year to 360 days.For the average person, living in a small town or village, the number of days ina year didn’t really matter. The seasons came and went, whether you counted themor not, so a calendar that was a few days out made no real difference.It was the ancient Egyptians who finally came close to measuring the actuallength of the year by adding five days that were supposed to be the birthdays ofOsiris, Isis, Horus, Nephtys and Set. Some scholars believe that the Nile actedas a calendar, flooding at the same time every year, but Egypt was – as we haveseen – green until a few thousand years ago. According to Egyptologist HenryLhote, the Sahara region was green between 7,000 and 2,000 BC11 – when the GreatPyramid was built, the surrounding landscape was probably a savannah. TheNeolithic Egyptians had no reason to pay close attention to the flooding of theNile. They were not dependent on it, as they are now. Why should these farmershave wanted a calendar of such accuracy? Schwaller de Lubicz would have saidthat it was a legacy from a far older civilisation – Atlantis.The people who developed a more precise calendar than anyone else – even moreexact than the Romans, whose Julian calendar was 365.25 days long – were theMaya, whose year was 365.242 days long. Why did the early Maya – the so-called‘classic Maya’ who built cities in the jungle before they mysteriously abandonedthem around AD 890 – want a calendar as accurate as that? Our own modernmeasurement, based on the caesium clock, is 365.2422, only 0.0002 secondslonger.Moreover, the Maya had invented a symbol for zero, which is now regarded as abasic essential in mathematics (neither the Greeks nor Romans had a zero).Mayan astronomy is also awe-inspiring in its complexity and precision. Wecalculate the year by the sun; so did the Maya, but they also calculated it bythe planet Venus, and by Jupiter–Saturn cycles. As to the length of our earthlyyear, they solved the problem that the Egyptians, the Greeks and even the Romanshad failed to solve by having no fewer than three distinct calendars based ondifferent years: a solar year of 360 days, to which they added 5 supernumarydays (although, as already noted, they knew its exact length); a lunar year of354 days; and a tzolkin, a special ‘sacred’ calendar of 260 days divided into 13months of 20 days each, which was used for magical and ritual purposes.These three cycles ran concurrently. Since the tzolkin was well into its secondyear when the ordinary year had only just come to an end, their ‘century’ was atotal cycle in which the three lesser cycles had finally caught up with oneanother, which was every 52 years. The ‘Venus year’ (584 days long) caught upwith the other cycle every two Mayan centuries (104 years).A further calendar, called the Long Count, was used to calculate long periods oftime. Its unit, as we have noted, was 20 days; 360 days (or 18 units) was a‘tun’, 20 tuns was a ‘katun’, 20 katuns was a ‘baktun’, which is 144,000 days,and 13 bak-tuns equalled a ‘Great Cycle’, or an ‘earth age’, at the end of whicheverything would be destroyed and start all over again. The end of the presentearth cycle will occur in the year AD 2012.The Mayan specialist David Kelley was interested in the Aztec calendar, which isclosely related to the Mayan calendar (the Aztecs ruled a few centuries afterthe Maya).12 He had noted similarities between the 20 days of the Aztec calendarand those of an ancient Hindu lunar zodiac, which divided the sky into 28mansions, corresponding to constellations. He noticed the storm god Rudra rulinga lunar mansion exactly halfway around the cycle from Apah, the water goddess;the Aztec calendar showed rain halfway around the cycle from the water goddess.And when Kelley set the two zodiacs side by side, he noted that the Aztec Deathappeared opposite Yama, the Hindu god of death. The next Aztec day, Deer,corresponded to the Hindu deer god, Prajapati.The next day in the cycle at first seemed less similar, with the Aztec Rabbitappearing next to the Hindu soma, an intoxicating drink – until Kelley recalledthat the Aztec rabbit goddess represents drunkenness. Moreover, she is also themoon goddess. Soma also rules the moon – in both Aztec and Hindu mythology, arabbit instead of a man lives in the moon. And in Mexico, they do not say thatsomeone is ‘as drunk as a skunk’, but ‘as drunk as 400 rabbits’.Kelley now had no doubt that the Aztec zodiac and the Hindu zodiac had the samesource, and that there must have been trans-Pacific contact. He also comments onthe similarities of the lunar zodiacs in the Middle East and the Far East, andthis connection between the Hindu and Aztec zodiacs brings to mind RobertGraves’s The White Goddess,13 whose central argument is that the religion of themoon goddess is far older than the religion of the sun god that eventuallyreplaced, or at least suppressed it.Kelley has an even more conclusive piece of evidence for trans-Pacific voyagers.He was intrigued by a speculation of the American sinologist Hugh Moran that theHebrew and Greek alphabets were derived from the Chinese lunar zodiac. This timethe link is with the Mayan rather than the Aztec calendar. Again, there areobvious correspondences. The Greek kappa and the Hebrew kaph correspond to theletter k; ‘kaph’ also means the palm of the hand, and Kelley notes that theMayan day Manik is represented as a hand and probably pronounced ‘keh’. Thefollowing letter in the Greek alphabet is lambda, which in Hebrew is lamed; inthe Mayan calendar it is lamat (another Mayan language calls it lambat, evencloser to lambda). Next in Hebrew comes mem, and in Greek mu, which means waternot only in Hebrew but also in the Semitic language from which the Greeksborrowed it; in Mayan, the next sign is mulu, which is ruled by the shark godand also corresponds to the Aztec day water. To Kelley this K–L–M sequence seemstoo close to be coincidence.Kelley believes that the Mayan calendar originated in a Hindu city calledTaxila, which was a great Indian trading post on the Silk Road to China and isnow in Pakistan. He points out that, after its conquest by Alexander the Greatin 323 BC, Taxila became a centre of learning like Alexandria, with scholarscoming from as far away as China and Egypt. These people, Kelley thinks,undertook the long voyage to Mexico.Kelley notes that Eastern rulers were deeply interested in eclipses because oftheir ‘occult’ significance: ‘To chart future eclipses, Taxilian scholars had toknow the earth’s circumference. Far more advanced scientifically than theEuropeans of Columbus’s day, the Taxilians already knew the earth was a sphere.’So the scholars of Taxila may have mounted an expedition to ‘do betterastrology’.When John Barber asked Kelley what kinds of ships could have been used byprimitive man, he indicated that he felt this was the wrong question. ‘Theshipping problem is a straw man. People can have made the trip any time in thelast 40,000 years. They could have made it intentionally and got back any timein the last 5,000 years.’ In short, Kelley agrees with Zapp and Erikson that manhas been a navigator for thousands of years.In fact, this view had been stated more than twenty years earlier. The God-Kingsand the Titans (1973)14 by James Bailey, and Gods of the Cataclysm (1976)15 byHugh Fox, both argued that there had been a worldwide seagoing civilisation longbefore the Greeks and Romans. In The God-Kings and the Titans, Bailey assertsthat the main force that drove the civilisations of the Bronze Age to the seaswas the quest for copper and tin, whose alloy bronze was the hardest metal knownto man. Much of the book is taken up with detailed comparisons of Meso-Americanculture and that of Asia and Europe, and a map shows Bronze Age trade routesfollowing the ocean currents and trade winds all over the Atlantic and Pacific.Bailey cites a Phoenician inscription discovered at Parahyba, Brazil, describinghow a ship from Sidon had been separated from a fleet of ten ships by a stormbefore it was cast up on those distant shores. Another Phoenician inscription atRio, 3,000 feet up on a vertical cliff face, states simply: ‘Tyre, Phoenicia,Badezir, firstborn of Jethbal.’ Whether or not the Phoenicians of the Rioinscription were in search of minerals, Bailey has no doubt that the Americancontinent was one of the old world’s main sources of tin and copper. In a sequelto The God-Kings and the Titans, called Sailing to Paradise (1994), he quotesthe technological historian R. J. Forbes: ‘Much of ancient history could berewritten as a struggle for the domination of quarries and ore-deposits ormetal-supplies’, adding: ‘This is the center of our argument in this book.’16In his foreword to The God-Kings and the Titans, palaeontologist Raymond Dartpoints out that historians of science took it for granted that mining beganabout 4,000 BC until the 1960s, when carbon-dating from the Ngwenya iron mine inSwaziland showed that mining for red iron ore (haematite) had been carried outthere as long ago as 7,690 BC. By 1969, it had been established that ourancestors had been mining in 41,250 BC. Dart concludes by mentioning ThorHeyerdahl’s Kon-Tiki expedition, saying that he ‘has opened the eyes of thewhole world to the grandeur of the maritime experience of mankind’.Gods of the Cataclysm (1976) by Hugh Fox was equally original and challenging.Fox’s wife was Peruvian, and Fox had spent many years studying the ancientcultures of Meso-America and South America. One of these was in Chavin, on thePeruvian coast, whose ruins were discovered in 1919. The archaeologist who hadexcavated Chavin had remarked that the ruins were covered by a huge amount ofdirt and rocks, as if the town had been inundated by waves.Fox had read a book called The Biblical Flood and the Ice Epoch (1966) by DonaldPatten,17 which argued that ‘the Great Flood was the pivotal point in humanhistory’, dividing prehistory from history. Patten believed that ‘an astralvisitor of some sort’ had swept close by the earth in 2,800 BC, destroying mostof mankind. There is considerable evidence for a flood in the Mediterranean areaaround 2,200 BC. In Uriel’s Machine, Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas havepreferred the later date of 3,200 BC for this flood, but this was certainly notPatten’s ‘world flood’, which almost wiped out mankind. And the date of thegreat flood ‘when the sky fell’ seems to have been about 9,600 BC.Fox points out that Patten’s notion that civilisation had almost been destroyedby a great flood seemed to have been confirmed in the silt-covered ruins ofChavin. He also noted that a stone cat he had brought from Chavin, everymillimetre of which was covered in designs, strongly resembled a Chinese bronzeelephant from the late Shang dynasty (2,000 BC) that he had seen in the FreerGallery in Washington. He became convinced of a connection between China andPeru.In Chavin excavators had also found stone heads with flat noses, exaggeratednostrils and protruding eyes. Fox had seen a piece of pottery in Taipei, inTaiwan, that had exactly the same features. His first theory was that Chinesefishermen had been swept across the Pacific, landing in Peru. Could they havebeen swept away by the great flood? This, he decided, was unlikely. What was farmore likely was that they had come to Peru before the flood. Then he began toexperience doubt: the Chavin heads did not look very Chinese. To begin with, theeyes were the wrong shape. Could it be that the seafarers were not Chinese, butpeople who had come from elsewhere through China and also been represented onthe Taipei pottery? He began to note similarities between the cultures ofancient India and Meso-America, for example, the phallic imagery in India and inUxmal in Mexico.What if these ancient voyagers were Dravidians, the original inhabitants ofIndia? These were a dark-skinned, phallus-worshipping people, who were conqueredand driven south by the invading Aryans. Their religion seems to have beenmatriarchal and they possibly worshipped the moon goddess.Fox’s comparative study of art from America, Asia and Europe led him to concludethat there was a time — which he calls Phase 1 — when there was a single worldculture. Then came the Great Cataclysm — the giant asteroid that swept past theearth and caused the flood. After that, the Andes continued to rise and thegreen Sahara began to change into a desert, and in this new period of history,the older worldwide culture was replaced by the Mediterranean culture (Phase 2)of the Greeks and the Phoenicians. Matriarchal culture disappeared, and a morebrutal patriarchal culture took its place. The Phoenicians (who had also beenactive in Phase 1) returned to Brazil and Mexico, but this time in search ofminerals and precious stones.As a picture of ancient history, Gods of the Cataclysm is powerfully argued, andits comparison of American, Asian and Mediterranean art is convincing. Twoobservations made earlier in this chapter seem to support its thesis: Zapp’scomment that ‘atl’ (as in Atlantis’) is not Greek but Mayan, and Kelley’sarguments about the similarity between the Hindu and the Aztec calendars. Itscentral argument, that history is divided into two phases, before and after thegreat flood, obviously accords with that of this book, except that Fox placesthe flood about 7,000 years later, in 2,800 BC instead of 9,600 BC.At first sight, Jim Bailey’s arguments seem less compelling, since they seem torefer mainly to the Bronze Age, which in Egypt began about 2,500 BC and inBritain about 2,000 BC, but he also argues that, before the beginning of theBronze Age, copper was equally sought after by ‘ancient voyagers’, and that theCopper Age began as early as 7,000 BC. (He also observes that among thethousands of clay tablets in Ashurbanipal’s library in Nineveh, no less than 8per cent were lists of minerals such as copper.) Certainly, the discovery thatman has been mining in South Africa for more than 40,000 years provides powerfulsupport for his thesis that mining has played a central part in the evolution ofcivilisation.In fact, he might have cited an even more remarkable discovery: that one ironmine in Africa dated from 100,000 years ago. And since Cro-Magnon man did notappear on earth until later than 100,000 years ago, then this mining must havebeen carried out by his predecessor, Neanderthal man. He seems to have used thered ochre (haematite) for ritualistic purposes, including burial. And itsuggests something that is directly linked to the blueprint: that the science ofgeology is much more ancient than we commonly assume. Mining is, after all, thetechnological application of the science of geology. Rand believes that, likeastronomy, geology is a very ancient science.What is beginning to emerge in all these different areas of research is apicture that has more in common with Hapgood’s worldwide maritime civilisationthan with the cautious views of scholars who believe that civilisation began atSumer round about 4,000 BC. This Asian diffusionist’ view has been gatheringstrength for a long time. In the 1940s, Gordon Eckholm drew up a long list ofcorrespondences between Asia and Meso-America. One of his students, Paul Tolstoyof the University of Montreal, has virtually proved his old professor’s thesiswith a study of bark cloth, a cloth made from the inner bark of trees that isturned into products such as felt and paper. Mexicans were making it when Cortésand his Spanish invaders arrived, but so were natives of Sulawesi, in Indonesia.Tolstoy has spent thirty years studying bark cloth manufacture from all aroundthe world, as well as examining the tools used in making it. Among hundreds ofexamples of bark cloths around the world, similarities of style between those ofIndonesia and Meso-America left Tolstoy in no doubt that they were closelyrelated. His conclusion was that Indonesians crossed the Pacific 1,000 yearsbefore Columbus. No modern scholars dispute the notion that the production anduse of bark cloth moved in the opposite direction: from Java and Borneo toAfrica, where it spread across the continent. This bark cloth was made with aquite different technique from that of Sulawesi – and Mexico.The powerful case for the argument that Mayan culture came from further west,across the ocean, has further support.Now we must consider another reason that is even more startling.Early nineteenth-century travellers to Mesopotamia, the Biblical ‘Land of theTwo Rivers’, must have been disappointed to find it so bare and unromantic: nopyramids or temples or obelisks, just an arid country of desert and dust storms,with odd-looking mounds that rose out of the brown plain like miniaturevolcanoes.In 1840, the French Consul at Mosul, on the west bank of the Tigris, was adoctor named Paul Emile Botta. A linguist and a scholar, he took a livelyinterest in those academic and philosophical disputes that, then as now, dividedFrench intellectuals into warring camps. Ever since Napoleon had takenarchaeologists with him to Egypt to study its pyramids and temples, the Frenchhad displayed an interest in archaeology, particularly since a young geniusnamed Champollion had succeeded in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics by meansof the Rosetta Stone.Botta had been following a dispute about the whereabouts of the ancient city ofNineveh, the capital of the Assyrians, where Sennacherib and Ashurbanipal hadstruck terror into the hearts of their neighbours. It seemed to have vanishedinto antiquity without a trace. One suggestion was that it had been located inthe region of Mosul.Botta found his consular duties less than absorbing, and Mosul full of dust andnoise, so he began to make a habit of riding out in the evening, to enjoy thebreeze along the river and the desert with its mysterious mounds. He also boughtpieces of ancient pottery and inscribed fragments of clay tablets from localArabs. He decided to start digging at a village called Kuyunjik, where there wasa promising-looking mound. As month after month went by without any find moresignificant than broken pottery and clay tablets, Botta began to feel he waswasting his time and money. The local Turkish pasha — Mesopotamia was then ruledby the Turks — also made life difficult by spying on the excavation andintimidating the workmen, convinced that the French consul was in search oftreasure. Botta was about to abandon archaeology when a persuasive Arab told himthat he would find plenty of ancient bricks and pottery in his village. Bottaneeded little persuasion to take his workmen to a village called Khorsabad, 7miles to the north, where his men sank a shaft and soon came upon a wall linedwith slabs of stone, on which there were drawings of animals. Botta had no doubtthat he had found Nineveh. He was wrong — he had discovered the palace of a kingcalled Sargon II, who ruled around 700 BC. It proved to be immense, with about200 rooms, whose walls displayed friezes of bearded men, warriors on horsebackand winged animals. Botta might not have discovered Nineveh, but he hadrediscovered ancient Assyria.For three centuries, from 911 BC until 610 BC, the Assyrians had hacked andslaughtered their way to power with such ferocity that their enemies finallybanded against them and killed them like vermin, reducing their cities tocharred rubble.Two centuries later, the Greek mercenaries of King Cyrus passed the vast ruinsof Nineveh and Nimrud — the story is told by the historian Xenophon — andmarvelled at these gigantic empty ruins, but the local inhabitants could tellthem nothing about the devastated cities — even the memory of the Assyrians hadbeen destroyed.In 1842, Botta met a young Englishman named Henry Layard, who had been dreamingabout the Middle East ever since he read, The Arabian Nights as a boy. The twooften shared a pipe together — sometimes of opium — and when Botta showed himthe mound of Kuyunjik, Layard seems to have been bitten by the bug ofarchaeological research, which has something in common with the gambler’s loveof backing long odds.Layard had no money, but he had a persuasive tongue, and three years latersucceeded in inducing the British ambassador in Constantinople to give him £60,which he used to begin excavating yet another mysterious mound, that of Nimrud(Calah). He unearthed finds even more spectacular than Botta’s — huge wingedlions and bulls that were soon on their way back to the British Museum. Nowfamous, and financed (parsimoniously) by the British treasury, Layard turned hisattention to Kuyunjik, which had defeated Botta a few years earlier. Withinhours, he realised how close the Frenchman had come to making one of the mostmomentous finds in archaeology, for this indeed was Nineveh, the great city ofthe Bible. Layard found himself digging into the burned-out palace ofAshurbanipal (669—626 BC), one of its mightiest and most ruthless kings.The French also returned to the race, and the mound of Kuyunjik was dividedbetween them. One day in 1852, when the French were absent, Layard’s assistantHormuzd Rassam decided to do a little poaching, and ordered his workmen totunnel into the French territory on the other side of the dividing line. The Godof Archaeology was with him, and he cut through a wall and found himself in thelibrary ofAshurbanipal, full of clay tablets inscribed with wedge-like cuneiform.Ashurbanipal, in spite of being one of the cruellest tyrants in history, was anenthusiastic collector of written records. Whenever he conquered a city, he hadits library transported to Nineveh, and as a result had collected some 30,000clay tablets, mostly concerned with magic, exorcism and divination. After theirrecovery, they were sent back to the British Museum.At this time no one could read cuneiform writing, although a British officernamed Henry Rawlinson had made an important start by copying an inscription on acliff near Behistun, in Persia; it had been carved there by the Persian kingDarius, and was in Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian (which was, more or less,a form of Assyrian). In 1857 Rawlinson published his first translation from theAssyrian language. By this time he had returned to England and was employed bythe British Museum, with a young man named George Smith, a banknote engraver whowas interested in archaeology, working for him.Among the tablets that Smith brought back from Nineveh was one containing huge,preposterously large numbers. No mathematician, Smith did not attempt to findout what they meant, but eventually French scholars translated them intodecimals. One Babylonian number contained fifteen digits: 195,955,200,000,000.It fascinated a French communications scientist named Maurice Chatelain,18 whoin the 1950s had moved to California after Morocco was plunged into chaosfollowing independence. Chatelain worked for the United States government as anaeronautics engineer, and in due course was drafted into the attempt to reachthe moon — the Apollo project.In 1963 Chatelain had learned about the incredibly complex Mayan calendar, whichis far more accurate than the European calendar. Impressed by the mathematicalabilities of the Maya, Chatelain suddenly found himself wondering if there161 could have been any connection between the Assyrians of Nineveh and theMaya.He soon discovered that the Nineveh number was not as arbitrary as it looked; itwas 70 multiplied by 60 to the power of seven.What would such an ancient civilisation be doing with such enormous numbers andthe mathematical sophistication they imply? We think of these early peoples asfarmers and artisans, rather than mathematicians. Chatelain recalled an obscurepiece of information: the Sumerians, the inventors of writing, did theircalculations in sixties, rather than in tens, as we do. And the Babylonians tooktheir culture wholesale from the Sumerians. And the Assyrians, in turn,conquered the Babylonians.The Sumerians were great astronomers, who knew how long it took each of theplanets to revolve in its orbit – not just our close neighbours, such as Venus,Mars and Jupiter, but also Uranus and Neptune. The Sumerians also divided theday into 24 hours of 60 minutes each, with each minute containing 60 seconds.With a flash of inspiration, Chatelain wondered if the Nineveh number couldexpress time in seconds. On this assumption, he worked it out to 2,268 milliondays, or something over 6 million years.The indefatigable engineer now recalled the precession of the equinoxes, thatwobble on the earth’s axis that takes just under 26,000 years to complete itscycle. (also known as a Big Year). He tried dividing this into the Ninevehconstant (as he called it), and immediately knew he was on the right track: itproved to be an exact number of precessional cycles: in fact, exactly 240 BigYears.Chatelain found himself wondering if the Nineveh constant was what astrologersand occultists had called ‘the great constant of the solar system’, a numberthat would apply to the revolution of all the bodies in the solar system,including moons. He proceeded to calculate the cycles of the planets in seconds(no doubt using the NASA computer), and found that each was an exact fraction ofthe Nineveh constant.If Chatelain was correct, he had made an awe-inspiring discovery. Ourpatronising modern view is that these ancient astronomers were only interestedin the heavens because of some absurd superstition about human fate beingwritten in the stars, the same belief that makes modern newspaper readers turnto their astrological forecast. In fact, the ‘Chaldean’ astronomers apparentlyunderstood our solar system as well as Isaac Newton did, and would have foundnothing beyond their comprehension in his Principia.If this proposition could be proved, it would offer overwhelming support for theidea that civilisation is many thousands of years older than we assume. If theSumerians knew the Nineveh constant over 5,000 years ago, their scientificknowledge had to have even earlier origins. Such a high level of intellectualsophistication could not have been achieved overnight.Chatelain went a step further. When he divided the Nineveh constant into solaryears, then compared this with a modern astronomical table based on a caesiumclock (which gives the most accurate estimation of the length of a second), hefound a slight discrepancy in the sixth decimal place. It was only atwelve-millionth of a day per year, but it puzzled him. Then he saw thesolution. Modern astronomical measurements tell us that the rotation of theearth is slowing down very slightly, so every year is getting shorter bysixteen-millionths of a second.The Nineveh constant proved to be totally accurate 64,800 years ago, and thatsuggested to Chatelain that it was first calculated 64,800 years ago – at a timewhen, according to anthropologists, our ancestor Cro-Magnon man had onlyrecently appeared in Europe.How does Chatelain explain a notion that seems so outrageous? The answer can befound in the title of his book Our Cosmic Ancestors (1987). Like von Däniken, hebelieves that our earth has been visited by beings from outer space. As a spacescientist, he learned that ‘all Apollo and Gemini flights were followed, both ata distance and also sometimes quite closely, by space vehicles ofextraterrestrial origin… Every time it occurred, the astronauts informed MissionControl, who then ordered absolute silence.’ Anyone who is interested in ‘flyingsaucers’ has heard that claim many times before. But this time it is made by aman who designed the communications system of the moon rockets.However his explanations are viewed, it is hard to fault the logic of hisdeductions about the date the Nineveh constant was first calculated. IfChatelain is correct, it would seem that our distant ancestors possessed a farmore sophisticated knowledge than we can explain in terms of conventionalhistory.When Chatelain initially heard of the immense Mayan numbers, he at first failedto attach any great significance to them. Years later he came across the noteshe had made, and was intrigued by two huge numbers that had been found on stelesat Quiriga, in Guatemala, the intellectual centre of the Mayan culture. Bothwere given (presumably) in days, which was the measure the Maya used. Hetranslated these into years, and found that one number was just under 93 millionyears, while the other was 403 million years. His work with the Nineveh constanthad made him curious, and he tried dividing the numbers by the Nineveh constant.He felt stunned when he realised that 93 million years is exactly 15 timeslarger than the Nineveh constant, while 403 million is 65 times larger.Chatelain published this incredible discovery in a book called Nos AncêtresVenus du comos (Our Venusian Cosmic Ancestors), published in Paris in 1975.Predictably it failed to make any impact, even when it was discussed by PeterTompkins in his bestselling Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids (1976). InNovember 1998 I read a much later version, Our Cosmic Ancestors, published by asmall press in Arizona ten years before. The chapter on the Nineveh numbercontained a vital piece of information for the book I was about to write withRand Flem-Ath, and Chatelain’s demonstration of the connection between the Mayaand the Sumerians staggered me.Consider its implications. The Maya, we believe, date from about 1,000 BC. Thereseems a general agreement that they received their knowledge from the Olmecs,the creators of those giant stone heads, first discovered in the 1860s, whichappear to be African, although there are authorities who believe the faces areChinese – a notion that certainly fits in with the ‘Asian diffusion’ theory.But even the Olmecs came thousands of years later than the Sumerians, who mayhave appeared in Mesopotamia in 4,000 BC or earlier. So how can there have beenany contact between them?We do not know where the Sumerians originated. In Eden in the East StephenOppenheimer theorised that they may have been driven from ‘Sundaland’ during thegreat flood of 6,000 BC and that they made their home in the Indus Valley beforemoving north to Egypt and Sumer. In From Atlantis to the Sphinx (1996) I pointedout that there is evidence that one of the Vedic hymns, the world’s oldest knownscriptures, seems to point to a date of 6,000 BC:In the 1980s, a Vedic scholar, David Frawley, observed that the hymns of theRig-Veda are full of oceanic symbolism that seems to argue that they sprang froma maritime culture – which certainly contradicted the assumption that the Aryanscame from somewhere in central Europe. He also noted hymns that spoke of the‘ancestors’ as coming from across the sea, having been saved from a great flood.Studying the astronomical references in the Vedic hymns, Frawley concluded thatone reference to a summer solstice in Virgo indicates a date of about 4,000 BC,while a reference to a summer solstice in Libra pointed to about 6,000 BC. Healso concluded that the authors of the Vedas were familiar with the precessionof the equinoxes. These revolutionary idea were set out in a book called Gods,Sages and Kings (1991).19I also mentioned other evidence from the Vedic hymns that they refer to anextremely early period, and concluded: ‘Frawley points out that the HinduVaruna, the Egyptian Osiris and the Greek Ouranos, are all symbolised by [theconstellation of] Orion, and that their myths seem to refer to the vernalequinox in Orion around 6,000 BC. ’20In From Atlantis to the Sphinx I had also spoken at some length about Hamlet’sMill by George Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, a study that sets out todemonstrate that the common denominator of all early myths is the idea of agreat grinding-mill of the stars (sometimes it is described as churning a sea ofmilk, the Milky Way). This grinding-mill represents the precession of theequinoxes – which, as we have seen, is the apparent backward movement of thevernal point (the constellation in which the sun rises at the spring equinox)through the constellations. At present the sun rises in Pisces at the springequinox, so we live in the Age of Pisces, but in about eight centuries’ time itwill rise in Aquarius, and our descendants of AD 2,600 will live in the Age ofAquarius. In the normal zodiac of astrology, Aquarius comes before Pisces. Hence‘precession’ of the equinoxes – they move backwards, in a slow circle in theheavens. This in itself offers proof that civilisation could be thousands ofyears older than historians and archaeologists believe: it takes 2,160 years forthe vernal point to move from one constellation to the next, and 25,920 yearsfor the whole precessional cycle to come around again to the beginning.Santillana and von Dechend make it clear that the Inuit, Icelanders, Norsemen,Native Americans, Finns, Hawaiians, Japanese, Chinese, Persians, Romans, ancientGreeks, ancient Hindus, ancient Egyptians and many others were familiar with thewhole cycle of ‘Hamlet’s mill’, the precession of the equinoxes (the book takesits title from the corn grinding-mill of Amlodhi, an Icelandic hero, whose namehas come down to us as Hamlet). These ancient peoples, unaware that precessionarises from a mere wobble on the axis, regarded the precession of the equinoxesas of tremendous religious significance, largely because they believed that theend of each age brings some immense catastrophe.Another book about precession is The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt, by Jane B.Sellers.21 She has been kind enough to send us a summary of her thinking.22It is possible that as early as the first use of diagonal calendars in 2100 BC,or their apparent ‘misuse’ in the tombs of Seti 1 (c. 1304 BC) and Ramesses IV(c. 1115 BC), the Egyptians had calculated the necessary number of years for the‘marker stars’ to rise once again on their original dates. This of courseinvolves reading the star calendars in a different way… and giving them adifferent purpose. This ‘Eternal Return’ would have been far more important forthe deceased king than the tracking of the hours of the night, or the days ofone year. Certainly by the time of Plutarch, who, after consulting Egyptianpriests wrote the first complete telling of the Osiris myth, it would appearthat a numerical formula for this return of the sky had been conceived. It is inPlutarch’s story of Osiris that we find all the numbers needed to announce thetime of a complete precessional cycle, adding support to the argument that notonly was the story of Osiris’ death and rebirth grounded in the observableresults of the precession, but at some time in their history the Egyptians hadattempted to understand and measure this mysterious complication of the heavens.By contrast, John Lash believes that he has found very ancient evidence ofprecession in a zodiac engraved on the ceiling of the temple of Hanthor atDendera. This zodiac, dating to about 100 BC, had always fascinated me — I wroteabout it for the first time in a book called Starseekers23 in 1980—1 becauseSchwaller de Lubicz had argued in his Sacred Science24 that it seemed to provethat the ancient Egyptians knew about the precession of the equinoxes in the Ageof Taurus, more than 6,000 years ago.John West was unconvinced by this particular argument. In his Serpent in the Sky(1979), he comments that the two superimposed circles are too irregular to proveanything. Studying the Dendera zodiac, I could see his point. However inNovember 1999, when I was a speaker at Andrew Collins’s Questing Conference atthe University of London, I heard the author John Lash talking about his work inprogress, The Skies of Memory;25 he offered some highly convincing new proofsthat the Egyptians indeed understood about precession.A zodiac has, of course, two axes, one running from north to south, the otherfrom east to west, so the two superimposed zodiacs of Schwaller had four axes,which he called A,B,C and D. To my delight, John Lash had discovered a fifthaxis, which he called E, and which points to our own age.I asked him to summarise his results for this book, and he sent me thefollowing:The main east—west axis of the Dendera zodiac passes through the middle of theconstellation of Aries, corresponding to a date circa 700 BC in precessionalterms.Dendera was restored for the last time under Augustus (30 BC—AD 14), though thework required is likely to have been ongoing for several centuries. The currenttemple is a make-over of a far more ancient structure. In fact the Frencharchaeologist, Auguste Mariette, observed with some surprise that thefoundations of Dendera were deeper than usual. While Luxor, Karnac and mostother Egyptian temples seem to be set right on the surface of the ground (soMariette noted), Dendera is sunk 20 feet into the earth! The date of 700 BC,attested by Schwaller de Lubicz on the authority of the French astronomer,Jean-Baptiste Biot, is roughly the midpoint of the Arien Age.Was the Dendera zodiac originally planned at the time, hence the alignment tothe east, traditional point of origin? Whatever the case, at the transition fromAries to Pisces, around 120 BC, the temple was still being renovated.The zodiac has two North Poles: one located in the Jackal, known to us as theLittle Bear, and the other in Tu-art, the Hippopotamus, known to us as Draco,the celestial Dragon.There are two poles because, as we know, the earth’s axis is tilted at 23.5degrees relative to its plane of motion around the sun. The North Pole pointscurrently to the Jackal, as at Dendera, but not to precisely the same place inthe Jackal. This is because the terrestrial axis slowly rotates around the axisof the earth’s orbital plane, centred eternally in Draco. This long-term‘wobble’ marks the precessional cycle of 25,920 years. The inclusion of bothpoles in the Dendera zodiac may be plain evidence that precession was known tothe ancient Egyptians.Precession of the equinoxes is supposed to have been discovered around 134 BC bythe Greek astronomer Hipparchus. He was looking at a star map made by hispredecessor Timocharis about 150 years before, and noted that a certain brightstar he was studying was positioned incorrectly, 2 degrees away from what shouldhave been its present position. He concluded that the star was moving at a rateof about 1 degree every seventy-five years. (In fact, precession causes amovement of 1 degree every seventy-two years.)Schwaller de Lubicz had argued that two hieroglyphs outside the circular zodiacmark a line between Gemini and Taurus, indicating a precessional date about4,000 BC, which further demonstrates how the Egyptians intended the Denderaartifact to show the shift in precessional Ages. John Anthony West is on recordas being unconvinced.However in 1999 I was working on a book about the World Ages when I was struckby an arresting observation. Any zodiac modelled on the four seasons naturallyhas two axes interlocked at right angles: the line of the equinoxes (east–west)and the line of the solstices (north–south). Clearly evident at Dendera, this‘axial cross’ has been noted by all scholars.The eastern end of axis A, passing through Aries, probably identifies the epochwhen the restoration of the temple was inaugurated, circa 700 BC, as notedabove. The design of the zodiac also clearly incorporates two other axes, C andD.But as I studied the overall design of the zodiac, I realised there was a fifth,as yet undetected axis. My attention was first drawn to its presence by thefigure of Virgo, the grain goddess identified with Isis, who holds up a stalk ofwheat in a gesture known from Sumerian sources as early as the third millenniumBC.I knew that the Dendera zodiac is an accurate astronomical model with axes thatcan be precisely dated according to precession – in short, a working star-clock.However, only two stars have been specifically indicated on it: Sirius, placedbetween the horns of the sacred cow on axis B, and Spica, the star traditionallyidentified with Virgo’s sheaf of wheat. This led me to wonder what an axisinscribed from Spica through the Jackal pole would look like.At the time Dendera was being restored, Spica had a special significance forastronomers. It so happened that Spica was the bright star initially observed byTimochares, the same one that later led Hipparchus to discover the precessionalof the equinoxes.Historians confirm that from 600 BC onward there was close contact between Greekand Egyptian astronomers, so we would be justified in assuming that Spica, knownas Mena to the Egyptians, was an item in their dialogue. Surely, then, there mayhave been a specific intention in highlighting Spica at Dendera.When I inscribed the fifth axis (E in the figure above), I noted threeremarkable features that could not, I imagined, be accidental. First, the axisculminates by bisecting the altar mounted by four ram’s heads, situated on theperiphery of the zodiac. This seems to interlock its internal features,represented by the solar zodiac of ecliptic constellations, with the lunarpattern of the decans, 10-degree divisions of the moon’s orbit, running aroundthe periphery.Second, axis E crosses Pisces at the tail of the lower or foremost fish exactlywhere the spring equinox occurs today.Third, axis E extended to Virgo’s feet marks the tail of Leo at a point thatcorresponds by precession to 10,500 BC. All in all, axis E marks the moment ofprecession when one full cycle ends and a new one begins.We are currently living through the last two centuries of the full 26,000-yearcycle.As the total pattern came into focus, I recognised that axis E signals thismoment of epochal transition in a vivid, intentional way. Whoever designedDendera was looking ahead in time to our age, when the spring equinox occursunder the tail of the western fish, because this is the time when the entirecycle culminates. With the spring equinox at just that position in Pisces, theaxial cross locks into unique alignment with the galaxy.In the last thirty years, astronomers have determined that the centre of ourgalaxy lies in line with the tip of the arrow of Sagittarius. Axis E stands atprecise right angles to this point.The half cycle, 12,960 years back from now, gives the date of 10,500 BC so hotlydebated in current investigations of prehistory. The half cycle is indicated bythe way that Spica, actually positioned 24 degrees from the lion’s tail, isaligned with it by the lie of the axis.Since the Egyptians were totally capable of representing the star patterns withhigh accuracy, I assumed that this anomaly was intended. Spica, which I call thepre-cessional star, seems to be the master key to the Dendera zodiac. Axis Ereveals an infrastructure based on galactic features only thought to have beenknown in recent times.If my inferences are correct, Dendera proves not only that precession was knownand applied to a scheme of World Ages, but that the entire cycle of 26,000 yearswas understood in its formal organisation.In other words, Lash has shown that precession had been known for thousands ofyears before the Dendera temple was rebuilt.Moreover, if Chatelain is correct, then both the Sumerians and the Maya alsoknew the exact length of the precessional cycle (the Nineveh constant is exactly240 times this cycle) and the two vast Maya numbers discovered at Quiriga can bedivided by the Nineveh constant.As to the Mayan knowledge of astronomy, Peter Tompkins writes:The Mayan cycle of 942,890 days, or 2,582 years, turned out to be 130Saturn–Jupiter conjunctions. (It also covers other cycles: 15 Neptune–Uranus,1,555 Jupiter–Mars, 2,284 Mars–Venus, 6,522 Venus–Mercury, and 2,720Saturn–Mars.) Twice this cycle, or 5,163 years, is 260 Saturn–Jupiterconjunctions, which gives a grand cycle with the same number as there are daysin the Mayan sacred year.Furthermore, the Mesopotamians had linked their measures of time and space – inseconds of time and seconds of arc. 34,020 million days is not only the numberof days in 3,600 Sumerian precessions of the equinox, but 3,600 tenths of adegree – consisting of 36,000 Egyptian feet of 0.308 meters – is thecircumference of the world… The Mesopotamians had not only chosen as a unit ofmeasure a foot that was earth-commensurate, it was also commensurate with thegreat Platonic year [the precessional cycle] of 25,920 years. Odd would it be ifthe unit dispensed by Hunab Ku [the Mayan Creator] to the Maya were not equallyearth-commeasurable. At Teotihuacan and at Palenque this ancient Middle-Easternfoot fits Cinderella’s shoe as neatly as it did at Cheops.26We are being asked to accept that the same measurement – based upon thecircumference of the earth – was used in ancient Egypt, Sumer, Teotihuacan andPalenque. But, even more incredible, that fairly primitive Indian people, whothought the sun might disappear permanently at the end of every 52 years, had aknowledge of the heavens that would not shame a modern Astronomer Royal.Chatelain says: ‘The Mayas also knew of the precession of the equinoxes and theexistence of Uranus and Neptune.’ How did they know about Uranus and Neptunewithout telescopes, thousands of years before Western astronomers discoveredthem?They had calculated the periods of revolution and conjunction of differentplanets, and discovered… some equivalent astronomical cycles, such as 65revolutions of Venus, which are equal to 104 solar years, or 327 revolutions ofMercury. They also used the cycle of 33,968 days to predict eclipses, and thiscycle was equal to 5 lunar precessions, 93 solar years, 196 eclipses, 150 lunarmonths… Meanwhile, the Mayas had also discovered a cycle of 1,886,040 days thatrepresented exactly 260 conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn, 2,310 of Mars andJupiter, 2,418 of earth and Mars, and 3,230 of Earth and Venus.27The great Mayan specialist Sylvanus Griswold Morley observed:When the material achievement of the ancient Maya in architecture, sculpture,ceramics, the lapidary arts, feather-work, cotton-weaving and dyeing are addedto their intellectual achievements – invention of positional mathematics withits concomitant development of zero, construction of an elaborate chronologywith a fixed starting point, use of a time-count as accurate as our ownGregorian Calendar, knowledge of astronomy superior to that of the ancientEgyptians and Babylonians – and the whole judged in the light of their knowncultural limitations which were on a par with those of the early Neolithic Agein the Old World [my italics], we may acclaim them, without fear of successfulcontradiction, the most brilliant aboriginal people on this planet.28The passage I have italicised underlines the problem. Graham Hancock has aninteresting remark about the Maya in Fingerprints of the Gods, in which he talksabout their amazing knowledge of astronomy, quoting the Mayan archaeologist EricThompson, who in 1954 asked how the Maya had come to chart the heavens yetfailed to grasp the principle of the wheel, to count in millions yet neverlearned to weigh a sack of corn. Perhaps, Hancock suggests, the answer is quitesimple: the Maya received their astronomical knowledge from ‘elsewhere’ – from amuch older civilisation.Gordon Eckholm found an intriguing piece of evidence that the Maya did knowabout the wheel. In an archaeological dig in the 1940s, Eckholm unearthed aMayan toy – a dog on four wheels, such as Western children have been pullingabout the nursery on a string for centuries. Eckholm pointed out the similaritybetween this toy and a Chinese wheeled toy of the same period (he dates themboth about 2,000 years ago). TheMaya had a wheeled toy, yet did not see that wheels could be used on carts orother vehicles. Apparently no one looked at the wheel and had a ‘Eureka’experience, which seems to suggest that the Maya were indeed, as Thompson said,‘unremarkable’. This hardly seems to be borne out by their astronomy or by theiramazing calendar, with its ‘Long Count’.Chatelain makes the same point:It is surely beyond imagination to think that thousands of years ago the Mayascould have, all by themselves, calculated a constant of 147,420 millions of days– a number that had twelve digits. But it is even more surprising to see thesame number, only 65 times smaller, and expressed in seconds instead of days,has been used by Sumerians, a nation on the opposite side of the globe. Thisfact seems to indicate that the Mayas and the Sumerians must have had directconnections with each other, or that they shared a common origin [my italics].29Since the Sumerians were at the height of their achievement 3,000 years beforethe Maya, we can probably rule out a ‘direct connection’, even if Hapgood iscorrect in believing that there was a worldwide maritime civilisation in 7,000BC. What seems far more likely is that we are dealing with an ancient culturethat had been studying the heavens for thousands of years, a culture based onseafaring.Chatelain, like von Däniken, believes that this knowledge came from spacevisitors but surely it is far more likely that it was observed by astronomerswho had studied the sky for thousands of years. It seems a reasonablespeculation that one reason the ancients were so interested in the sky was thatthey made use of their knowledge of the stars in navigation.A discovery made in 1997 adds powerful support to this argument. Exploring anancient lake bed at Mata Menge, on the island of Flores (which is east of Javaand Bali), a group of palaeoanthropologists from Australia found stone tools.The bed of volcanic ash in which the tools were found by Mike Morwood andcolleagues from the University of New England (New South Wales) dated from morethan 800,000 years ago, the time of Homo erectus. Animal bones from nearby gavethe same date. What was unusual is that Flores is a relatively small island, notknown to be a site of ancient man. The nearest such location is the far largerisland of Java, the home of Java man, who also belongs to our earliest ancestor,Homo erectus.To reach Flores, these primitive men would have had to sail from island toisland, making crossings of around a dozen miles. Moreover, Morwood argues, theorganising ability required by a fairly large group to cross the sea suggeststhat Homo erectus possessed some kind of linguistic ability.This was a conclusion that I had reached when, in A Criminal History of Mankind(1983), I discussed the finds made in caves near Chou-kou-tien, in China, in1929: fourteen skulls of Homo erectus, which had a sloping forehead and recedingchin. All the skulls were mutilated at the base, as if the brain had beenscooped out. Peking man, as he came to be labelled, was a cannibal — for wepresume that he was killed (and roasted and eaten) by other Peking men,approximately half a million years ago.Cannibalism is seldom a matter of nourishment; even as practised in recenttimes, it is mainly ritualistic, based upon the belief that the strength andvitality of a dead enemy can be absorbed by eating him. Peking man apparentlyhad plenty of other meat, as suggested by the many animal bones in his caves. Ifhe practised ritualistic cannibalism, then we must assume he had some kind oflanguage, since it is hard to imagine a ritual without language.Homo erectus was the first man we recognise as our ancestor, the first to walkupright all the time. His heart had to work harder to increase the supply ofblood to his brain, which increased the size of his brain and also hisintelligence. It seems at least a reasonable assumption that his brain had a‘language matrix’, just as a bird’s has a flight matrix.This, at all events, seems to be one important implication of the traces of Homoerectus found on Flores. We cannot imagine even a chimpanzee building a raft,because it cannot communicate linguistically.Why should Homo erectus want to move to Flores from Java? Presumably in searchof that basic instinctive requirement of all animals – territory. He would havebeen able to see other islands from Java mountain tops, and if the competitionfor food or aggressive neighbours were making life hard, then he may havedecided to move on, taking his family with him. But if he was able to build araft, then he must have been far more intelligent than his predecessors.Another recent discovery, described by science writer John McCrone,30 addsweight to this notion that Homo erectus was possibly more intelligent than wegive him credit for, in that he was using fire as long ago as 1.6 million years.From the 1970s onwards, many anthropologists have supported the view held byLouis Leakey that man learned to make fire a mere 40,000 years ago. In Leakey’sview, man became a warlike creature as a result of sitting around a fire atnight, telling stories of battle and heroism. So fire was responsible for the‘cultural explosion’ that created Homo sapiens.But in the 1970s and 1980s, evidence of campfires was uncovered at Koobi Foraand Chesowanja in Kenya. ‘Lenses’ of orange earth were found in association withthe bones and stone tools of Homo erectus, and similar lenses – about 18 inchesacross – were found beneath the campfires of local people. In 1999, a study byRalph Rowlett of the University of Missouri–Columbia established beyond doubtthat these lenses were made by campfires, not bush fires caused by lightning.Rowlett’s colleague Randy Bellomo made an interesting use of earth magnetism todemonstrate that such fires had been made over many years. As Hapgood had noted,iron in the soil aligns with the magnetic pole, and heating ‘perman-ises’ thisalignment like a compass. Bellomo found that the Koobi Fora iron sediments hadseveral slightly different magnetic alignments, implying repeated visits of anomadic tribe over a long period.Brian Ludwig of Rutgers University studied 40,000 or so flint artifacts and thedebris of tool-making, trying to determine if tool-making methods had remainedstatic. He found dimples known as potlid fractures – fractures due to exposureto fire – on tools from 1.6 million years ago.So again, we have evidence that Homo erectus was a more intelligent being thanany anthropologist had dared to suggest. And this again suggests that hepossessed some form of language.And if he could communicate in language and build a raft, then the next questionbecomes self-evident: could it be that Homo erectus was not only the first manbut the first longdistance sailor? The upright posture is ideal for scanning thehorizon at sea. And he had plenty of time – half a million years or more – todevelop from island-hopping to sailing the open sea. He also had plenty of timeto develop his obsession with the stars.All this raises another pertinent question. If our ancestors were sailing theseas 800,000 years ago, why did it take man another 792,000 years (the firstrecognised civilisation, Jericho, is dated at 8,000 BC) to start buildingcivilisation? The answer must be that it didn’t take so long. Our problem isthat we do not recognise the signs of civilisation when we see them – such asthe stone balls of Costa Rica that suggest that man was navigating thousands ofmiles of ocean ‘before civilisation’. But if there was no civilisation, whyshould he bother? Men sail the ocean largely for trading purposes. Surely it ismore likely that Hapgood is correct, and that a worldwide maritime civilisationexisted in 100,000 BC?Again, there is evidence that our ancestors of 400,000 years ago – by then Homosapiens – were more intelligent than we give them credit for. In Timescale,Nigel Calder states: ‘Piagetian tests applied to stone tools from Isimila,Tanzania, which may be as much as 330,000 years old [by uranium-series dating]are said to indicate that the makers were as intelligent as modern humans.’31Raising this question in From Atlantis to the Sphinx, I commented that thereason civilisation had not developed much sooner was because human beings tendto live mechanically, doing today what they did yesterday and last year. Thereare probably millions of human beings in the world today whose intelligence isas great as the famous scientists, artists and intellectuals in our historybooks, yet they remain unknown because they fail to make any determined attemptto pull themselves out of their daily routine.When I wrote these comments, Mike Morwood and his team from New South Wales hadnot yet discovered the tools in the lake bed in Flores that indicated that Homoerectus was sailing the seas 800,000 years ago. This, in turn, altered my viewabout human language. Like most people, I had begun by assuming that mandeveloped language in the past 30,000 years or so. The discovery that Peking manwas a cannibal had made me revise that opinion to the extent of believing thathe was intelligent enough to possess some kind of ritual, and thereforelanguage. I was inclined to believe that the ‘brain explosion’ that has occurredin the past 500,000 years – the sudden increase in man’s brain size – was theresult of the development of language.But the Flores discovery throws doubt on my assumption. It suggests that man hadenough language 800,000 years ago to co-operate in raft-building and sailing.That in turn led me to wonder whether language may not be as natural to man asthe upright posture, and that men may have been talking to one another forperhaps a million years. In which case, it seems inconceivable that he developedcivilisation only in the past 10,000 years. The Mayan knowledge of mathematicsand astronomy alone makes the idea seem absurd. Even if we have our doubts aboutChatelain’s evidence on the Nineveh constant and the two gigantic numbersdiscovered at Quiriga, we are still left with an achievement that seems utterlybeyond what we regard as the normal human capabilities.I would suggest that there is only one logical solution: civilisation isthousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of years older than we think. But in thatcase, where is the proof? Where are the ruins of this older civilisation?This was the challenge thrown down by the Giza plateau authority when John Westand Robert Schoch suggested that the Sphinx may be at least twice as old asEgyptologists believe. ‘Show us the intervening civilisation.’ But any evidenceof such a civilisation may be buried beneath the desert sand, as that strange,monolithic structure called the Oseirion was buried under the sand below thetemple of Seti I – a structure whose bleak, massive blocks and lack ofornamentation suggest some older stage of Egyptian civilisation.32 Otherevidence may lie beneath the sea, or beneath the ice of Antarctica. When weconsider such evidence as Hapgood’s ‘ancient sea kings’, or the Nineveh constantand the Quiriga numbers, it becomes hard not to acknowledge that there issomething oddly wrong with our present limited view of human history.Equally convincing, I would suggest, is the evidence that Rand Flem-Ath hasamassed in his study of ancient religious sites and their curiously preciseplacing on the face of the earth."},{"pageContent":"7FALLEN ANGELSAND THEIR FACES shone like the sun, and their eyes were ‘A-like burning lamps;and fire came forth from their lips. Their dress had the appearance of feathers:their feet were purple, their wings were brighter than gold; their hands whiterthan snow.’1This was the sight that greeted Enoch, Noah’s greatgrandfather, when he wasawakened one night by two tall, shining creatures. The strangers flew Enoch tothe sky, from where, he tells us, ‘they showed me a very great sea, much biggerthan the inland sea where I lived’.2 Since Enoch lived somewhere in the MiddleEast, this inland sea is probably the Mediterranean and the ‘much bigger sea’may have been the Atlantic Ocean, or ‘real ocean’ referred to in Plato’s accountof Atlantis.Before leaving with these two strange visitors, Enoch had instructed his sonsnot to try to find him, which suggests that his destination was on earth, not inheaven. He was transported to a place full of ‘light without any darkness’ whichwas covered in ‘snow and ice’ that was ‘at the ends of the earth’.Enoch lived centuries before the flood, so this is a rare description of thehome of the gods before it was destroyed. He was told that he’d reached‘heaven’. Christian and Barbara O’Brien, who have studied this material indetail, are inclined to translate ‘heaven’ as ‘highlands’.We don’t have to travel far to recognise a very real place here on our planetthat fits this description; a high place of endless days and polar conditionswhich lies at the end of the earth. Antarctica is the highest continent on theplanet, having an average altitude more than twice that of the second-highest(Asia). Was the ‘heaven’ that the two strangers showed Enoch another name forAtlantis? Another name for Antarctica?All of these fascinating details are found within the Book of Enoch. Revealedwithin its colourful pages are the methods of ancient scientists determined tomeasure and survey their planet. In doing so they left a record of theirfindings for us in the location of sacred sites around the globe.This important book would have been lost for ever had it not been for thewanderings of one of the most eccentric characters of the eighteenth century, aScotsman named James Bruce, who was born in 1730 and spent twelve years of hislife in a mysterious quest in the unknown heart of Africa. One of the mostinteresting things he brought back was a forgotten book called the Book ofEnoch, regarded as so sinister and blasphemous that a Christian could endangerhis soul just by reading it.Bruce was a Scottish aristocrat, descended from a line of kings that includedRobert the Bruce, who defeated the English at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.James Bruce would have made a formidable opponent in battle, being 6 feet, 4inches tall and powerfully built, with red hair and a loud voice. He was also anegoist of monstrous proportions, so it becomes possible to see why he inspiredmore than his due share of dislike and died a thoroughly embittered man.As a schoolboy at Harrow, Bruce wanted to be a clergyman; his father wanted himto become a lawyer. Both were disappointed. Bruce’s attempt to study law sobored him that he had a nervous breakdown, and his father let him go his ownway. His ambition was to travel to distant places and explore the unknown. Heapplied for permission to become a trader in India, then his attention wasdiverted by falling in love. Unfortunately, the girl — the orphaned daughter ofa wealthy wine merchant, with vineyards in Spain and Portugal — was consumptive.Bruce and his new wife were on their way to Provence when she suddenly fell illin Paris and died within days. Sick with grief, Bruce had her buried at midnightthen rode through a storm to Boulogne, where he collapsed.Back in Scotland he flung himself into the study of languages and history — hewas particularly fascinated by the Freemasons and the Knights Templar — and wentoff on a trip to visit Templar sites in Europe. He had to return when his fatherdied. At twenty-eight, Bruce had become the heir to the estates.The Age of Steam was about to arrive, and the Industrial Revolution had alreadystarted. Bruce, of course, had no interest in such matters — his mind was in theMiddle Ages, dreaming of knights and crusaders — but fortunately for him coalwas discovered on his land at Kinnaird, and he leased it to a mining company,who paid him a generous royalty. Now he was able to indulge his passion forfaraway places. He went to Spain and studied Arabic manuscripts in the Escurial,travelled down the Rhine by boat and studied antiquities in Italy.Bruce was a Freemason, of the Canongate Lodge of Kilwinning. Through the officesof another Freemason, Lord Halifax, he was offered the post of consul atAlgiers, which appealed strongly to his romanticism and promised spare time forarchaeology. It proved harder work than he expected. The Bey of Algiers wascapricious, difficult and occasionally violent, and on one occasion had a courtofficial strangled in the consul’s presence. Bruce needed all his stubbornnessand determination to avoid being tied up in a sack and thrown into theMediterranean. After two years it was a relief to resign his post.Then, at the age of thirty-five, he prepared to embark on the adventure of alifetime. His precise goal is still not entirely known. In The Blue Nile(1962),3 Alan Moorehead has no doubt that he was obsessed by finding the sourceof the Nile, which would certainly have brought him worldwide celebrity, sinceit was at that time still undiscovered. But he is also known to have beenfascinated by the black Jews of Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), the Falashas, perhapsbecause their presence suggested that the Ark of the Covenant might have beenbrought there by them from Jerusalem. As a man with a deep interest inscripture, James Bruce certainly wanted to find out more about the peculiarmystery of the Book of Enoch. The apocryphal book of the Old Testament had beenheld in veneration by early Christian theologians such as Origen and Clement ofAlexandria, then it had disappeared. Rumour suggested that it containedscandalous information about angels and their sexual behaviour, perhapsexplaining why the early Church decided to suppress it (if indeed that was thecase).Encountering many perils and adventures – such as shipwreck and brigands – Brucemade his way to Cairo, and from there travelled up the Nile. His aim was to goto Abyssinia, a country virtually unknown to Europeans – only two Catholicmissionaries were known to have visited there, although Bruce had a low regardfor Catholics, being fiercely Protestant.The first part of his journey was pleasant enough – up the Nile by boat as faras Aswan. It was not the first cataract that deterred him there, but a localwar. He decided to continue by the Red Sea. In a few weeks, he was facingunknown territory. Eventually, Bruce and his party found their way to the townof Gondar, which was then the capital of Abyssinia and consisted of about 10,000clay huts with conical roofs, overlooked by the king’s palace, with its viewdown across the vast inland sea, Lake Tana.The name Abyssinia means ‘confusion’, and Bruce found the country in turmoil –apparently its usual state – with the king and his vizier away on a punitiveexpedition. It was soon clear that an exceptionally high level of violence wasregarded as quite normal. Soldiers rode around with the testicles of theirenemies dangling on their lances. Their favourite meal was steak, which they ateraw, simply slicing it off the buttock of a living cow, after which the rawpatch was covered in clay and the animal turned loose again. When Bruce firstmet the king, Tecla Haimanout, and his vizier, Ras Michael, on their return theywere amusing themselves by putting out the eyes of a dozen captives.Bruce was lucky; he might well have been castrated or beheaded. But Ras Michaeltook a liking to him, and gave him command of a troop of the King’s Horse.Bruce, never averse to showing off, dressed up in chainmail, stuck pistols inhis wide cummerbund and impressed his hosts with his ability to shoot mountainkites while galloping on a black charger.In due course, Bruce managed to do a little exploring. He was taken to amountain top that was the source of a river called the Little Abbai, which hisguide assured him was the source of the Nile. Bruce was suitably impressed, buthis guide was quite wrong – the source of the White Nile is 1,000 miles furthersouth in Lake Victoria, while the source of the tributary Blue Nile is actuallyin Lake Tana, several miles to the north of the mountain where they stood. Brucewas an enthusiast rather than a conscientious geographer. But in the Gondarmonastery, on the shores of Lake Tana, he came upon a discovery that made up forhis misidentification of the source of the Nile.Abyssinia had been a Christian country since AD 320, but since it was so farfrom the great northern centres of Christianity it had maintained its owntradition. One of the most interesting parts of that tradition is contained inan epic called the Kebra Nagast, or the Book of the Glory of Kings. When Brucewent to Gondar, no one in Europe had ever heard of the epic. Its narrative tellshow the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Ethiopia from Jerusalem in the ninthcentury BC. It seemed that the Queen of Sheba had her capital in Abyssinia. Shewas a beautiful young virgin, who had been on the throne for six years when sheheard about Solomon and his wisdom and made the trip to Jerusalem to meet him.Both were impressed, and on the night before she left Jerusalem, he begged herto spend the night with him. She agreed on condition that she should retain hervirginity. Solomon gave his word, with the unusual condition that it dependedupon her taking nothing from him. Since she had no intention of taking anything,she agreed.In the middle of the night, the queen got out of bed to drink from a bowl ofwater. Solomon woke up and pointed out that she had broken her promise. ‘Butit’s only water,’ she protested. ‘What is more precious than water?’ askedSolomon. And since the queen had to agree with him, she yielded her virginity.Nine months later, back in Abyssinia, she bore a son. After twenty years, theyoung man returned to Jerusalem to see his father. Solomon became so fond of himthat he anointed him king, and when the youth departed for Abyssinia the eldestsons of all Solomon’s courtiers went as his escort. They were dismayed anddepressed at the thought of leaving behind the Ark of the Covenant, the mostsacred symbol of the Hebrews, which contained the Tables of the Law brought downfrom Mount Sinai by Moses, so the son of the high priest suggested that theytake the Ark with them. This was accomplished, with the aid of the Angel of theLord, who declared that the Ark itself had decided it was time to leaveJerusalem.And that, according to the Kebra Nagast, was how the Ark came to Abyssinia.When Bruce read this account he must have been immensely excited. It seemed toshow that not only was the Abyssinian Church the oldest in the world, but thatit could trace its roots back to King Solomon. And perhaps – who knows? – thismight also have been true of the Freemasons. As to the Falashas, the black Jewsof Abyssinia, perhaps they traced their descent from the courtiers who hadaccompanied the young king to Abyssinia. Had Bruce, in fact, heard of the KebraNagast in his Arabic researches – perhaps in the Escurial – and is it possiblethat his motive in coming to Abyssinia was not to find the source of the Nile,but to find the Ark of the Covenant?Bruce’s next discovery was, if anything, even more exciting. In this samemonastery, he was also allowed to read a copy of the long-lost Book of Enoch. Ithad aroused so much curiosity that Queen Elizabeth’s astrologer Dr John Dee hadtried to obtain a copy by supernatural means. He and his magician assistantEdward Kelley had taken part in seances in which ‘angels’ (or spirits) haddictated the Book of Enoch – or at least, a Book of Enoch – to Kelley. (Whetherthe text was the same one discovered by Bruce will never be known, since it hasvanished.)A glance at this strange manuscript must have told Bruce why early Christianscholars had regarded it as so important – it claimed to be a vital missingportion of the history of the world. Enoch was the grandson of Adam and the sonof Cain, and was also, in turn, the father of Methuselah, who was in turn thegrandfather of Noah. Bruce may have considered it merely as an interestingextension of the Biblical canon; he was a highly educated Scot, living in theage of Voltaire and Gibbon, who may have regarded the contents of the Book ofEnoch as so much quaint and absurd myth. On the other hand, as a Freemason it isequally possible that he read Enoch with intense personal interest because ofthe Masons’ ancient tradition that Enoch had foreseen the destruction of theworld by the great flood.This was in 1770, a year after he had arrived in Abyssinia. When he returnedfrom Gondar, a civil war was taking place. Bruce decided to join in, since hewas an army commander, but it ended in the defeat and flight of Ras Michael andthe slaughter of his followers.Bruce survived and was able to leave the country he had come to detest. It was along and exhausting trip back to civilisation – about eighteen months – and hespent some time recuperating in Italy and Paris before finally returning toLondon in June 1774.This exotic story had no happy ending. We might expect that Bruce’s travelswould have brought him fame, for the eighteenth century dearly loved travellers’tales – James Boswell had become a celebrity on the strength of visitingCorsica, while an impostor named George Psalmanazar who claimed to be a nativeof Formosa (now Taiwan) acquired fame and became a close friend of Dr Johnson.Bruce’s reception was more like that of Marco Polo on his return from China;those who had read Marco’s travels took them for fiction. James Bruce suffered asimilar reception when he told his stories of men eating steaks off live cattleand chopping off parts of their fellow human beings with the same ferocity.People listened politely, hiding a smile of disbelief, which may have beenpartly because of the manner in which Bruce told the story, for he was unable toconceal his high opinion of himself.He went to London, found a needy clergyman called Latrobe, and spent a yeardictating his Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile. He promised to pay hisamanuensis when the five volumes were finished, although it is typical of hismean and ungenerous nature that he delayed payment then tried to fob Latrobe offwith five guineas. It is almost satisfying to record that the book was receivedwith malice and derision. He died five years later after tripping on the stairsand falling on his head.It has to be admitted that, for all his character defects, Bruce produced one ofthe great travel books. He had also performed another important service toliterature by bringing back the Book of Enoch – no fewer than three copies, infact, one of which he presented to the Bodleian Library in Oxford and another tothe Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris (he kept the third himself, next to the Bookof Job, where he claimed it belonged). Once again, his timing was poor. In themidst of the Age of Enlightenment, interest in religion was at a low ebb andchurches were half empty. Nobody was interested in an obscure apocryphal book ofthe Bible, and it remained untranslated.The Book of Enoch finally appeared in English in 1821, more than a quarter of acentury after Bruce’s death, translated by a Hebrew scholar named RichardLaurence. At least the world was now ready for it – the age of Romanticism hadarrived, with its interest in ghosts, demons and the supernatural. This story oflibidinous fallen angels thrilled a wide audience.We might say that the Book of Enoch takes its origin from the passage in Genesis6 that tells how the sons of God – angels – took note of the fact that thedaughters of men were fair and decided to take them as wives. And then ‘therewere giants in the earth in those days… when the sons of God came in unto thedaughters of men, and they bare children to them, and the same became mighty menwhich were of old, men of renown’.The Book of Enoch elaborates this story. It seems that in the days of Jared,Enoch’s father, 200 rebel ‘angels’, who are called the Watchers, descended onthe top of Mount Hermon, over 9,000 feet high, and prepared to go down to theplains with the intention of having sexual intercourse with mortal women.According to Enoch, it would seem that the rebel Watchers took mortal women intotheir beds, and their mistresses gave birth to ‘giants’ who were virtuallyungovernable. They began to ‘devour’ human beings and developed a taste forblood. The simplest way to make sense of this passage is to assume that theoffspring of the Watchers became violent and warlike, rather like theAbyssinians of Bruce’s day, whose endless brutality caused him to flee thecountry. It seems that the rebel angels also taught men the art of makingweapons by smelting metal, and that they encouraged sexual licence by teachingwomen how to wear ornaments and use make-up. They also instructed them insorcery and ritual magic. The picture that emerges is that of an early tribalcivilisation, where the women had so far been accustomed to bearing children anddoing the hard work. The Watchers taught them that life could be more enjoyableif they treated sex as a means of pleasure. They also taught them how to abortany unwanted results of their promiscuity.Modern readers might view this without disapproval, feeling that the women ofthat time probably needed encouragement towards liberation, which was, in fact,the view taken by Romantics such as Lord Byron and his friend Thomas Moore.Byron’s play Heaven and Earth appeared in the same year as the translation ofthe Book of Enoch, and is based on the passage in Genesis about the sons of Godtaking the daughters of men for wives. It ends with a spectacular evocation ofthe flood, and the notes mention that ‘the Book of Enoch, preserved by theEthiopians, is said by them to be anterior to the flood’. In 1823, Moorepublished a poem, ‘The Loves of the Angels’, based on the same subject.The rebel Watchers were not simply instructors in debauchery; one taughtastronomy, another astrology, another knowledge of the clouds, another how tocounter magic spells, and others knowledge of the sun, moon and earth. Despitetheir intentions, God decided they had to be punished, and sent off his ownWatchers, including Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel, to enforce his will. (Theseservants of God are also called Watchers, suggesting that not all the Watcherswere rebel spirits.) The rebel Watchers were rounded up and imprisoned. (The Godof the Old Testament seems to be as merciless as any human tyrant.) According toAndrew Collins, whose book From the Ashes of Angels (1996)4 is perhaps the bestintroduction to this topic, the location of the imprisonment of the rebelWatchers was close to the place where they descended, on Mount Hermon.And so God decided to cleanse the earth with a great flood, of which the onlysurvivor was Noah. But before that, Enoch has a further story to tell. It seemsthat his son Methuselah had a son named Lamech, whose wife bore a child, Noah.His appearance came as a shock to his father: the baby’s skin was not the samecolour as that of other natives of the Middle East, that is to say, brown, butpure white and rosy red, like that of some native of a northern country. Hishair was also white and his eyes were so beautiful that they seemed to light upthe room.Lamech went to Methuselah, and told his father, I have begotten a strange son,not like a human being, but more like the children of the angels…’ Lamechsuspected that his son had been fathered by one of the Watchers. Methuselah wasunable to reassure him, but went off in search of his father, Enoch, who hadretired to a far-off land (called Paradise in a fragment of the same story foundamong the Dead Sea Scrolls). Enoch told Methuselah to reassure his son. Thenewborn child was indeed his own, and he was to be named Noah. Enoch hadforeseen in a vision that the world was going to be destroyed by a deluge, butthat Noah and his children would ‘be saved from the corruption’ that wouldengulf the earth. (It is apparent these events take place before the rebelWatchers arrived on earth.) So it seemed that God had chosen Noah as the fatherof the new race of humanity.Still, one cannot help feeling a mild suspicion that Enoch may not have beenentirely truthful with Methuselah, and that perhaps this future race would havea touch of the fallen angel in its composition…The Book of Enoch that Bruce brought back from Abyssinia was not the onlyversion. In fact, many later fragments were found, even in Greek and Latin; yetanother, in the Slavonic language, contained some interesting additions to thestory.We should note that the Book of Enoch was not written down until about 200 BC,almost certainly by some member of the Essene community at Qumran on the DeadSea, but the oral tradition was much older. The Slavonic version, known as TheSecrets of Enoch,5 was probably compiled by a Jewish writer living in Alexandriaaround the time of Jesus.It contains the account which opens this chapter of Enoch’s abduction by tallbeings to a place of continuous light which was covered in snow and ice.After they reach their destination Enoch is then taken on a tour that includes ahideous pit which became the prototype for the Christian hell:And the men then led me to the Northern region, and showed me there a veryterrible place. And there are all sorts of tortures in that place. Savagedarkness and impenetrable gloom; and there is not light there, but a gloomy fireis always burning, and a fiery river goes forth. And all that place has fire onall sides, and on all sides cold and ice, thus it burns and freezes. And theprisoners are very savage, and the angels terrible and without pity, carryingsavage weapons, and their torture was unmerciful.And I said: ‘Woe, woe! How terrible is this place!’ And the men said to me:‘This place, Enoch, is prepared for those who do not honour God; who commit evildeeds on earth.’6Hell was a Christian concept that – like the Devil – was unknown to the Jews.‘Sheol’, sometimes translated as ‘hell’, simply meant a place where rubbish wasdestroyed, and this passage, which seems to prefigure Dante’s Inferno, wasprobably a major reason that the Book of Enoch ‘vanished’. The idea that‘heaven’ might include a place of torment would have been unacceptable to theChurch Fathers.After his glimpse of ‘hell’, Enoch was taken on a tour – this time by the angelRaphael – around Paradise, or the ‘Garden of Righteousness’. This seems to bethe Garden of Eden, for when he commented on a particularly beautiful tree witha delicious fragrance, he was told that this was the Tree of Knowledge fromwhich Eve plucked one of the fruits (apparently these fruits hung in clusterslike grapes, so they cannot be apples). What seemed to be worrying the Lord –who is referred to as Yahweh-Elohim – is a second tree called the Tree of Life.If man ate the fruits of this tree, his life would be immensely extended.Now comes one of the most interesting passages in the Book of Enoch: ‘And I sawin those days how long cords were given to the Angels, and they took themselveswings and flew, and went towards the north. And I asked an Angel, saying untohim: “Why have they taken cords and gone off?” and he replied: “They have goneto measure.”’Knotted ‘cords’ were used by Egyptian priests to plan their temples. These cordswere nothing less than practical geometric survey tools. Christian O’Brien, anengineer with surveying experience, translates this passage into secular terms:‘Then I saw how long measuring “tapes” were given to some of the angels and theyhurried off towards the north. So I asked the angel with me why the others hadtaken tapes and gone away, and he replied, “They have gone to make a survey”’7Angels undertaking a survey? It doesn’t make sense within the Christian conceptof angels. But what if these beings were ancient scientists pursuing ageological and geographic survey?For the Book of Enoch also reveals the all-important purpose of the survey withthe words: And these measures shall reveal all the secrets of the depths of theearth…’8 The survey was geological.Rand was familiar with Andrew Collins’s book From the Ashes of Angels, whichrecounts the story of Enoch. Collins describes how, in the late nineteenthcentury, the Babylonian Expedition from the University of Pennsylvaniadiscovered fragments of a broken clay cylinder at Nippur, in what was stillcalled Mesopotamia. They were found in the temple ofEnlil, the supreme god of the Sumerians, less important only than Anu, Lord ofthe Universe, and were written in cuneiform wedge script. We may recall thetablets found in the mound of Kuyunjik in 1852, which proved to contain the epicof Gilgamesh, and might be forgiven for assuming that the translation of thiscylinder became a matter of prime importance, but it was taken back to theUniversity of Philadelphia by Professor Herman V. Hilprecht, where it was leftin the basement of the museum, still in its packing case.Hilprecht is known to the history of psychical research through another curiousincident involving Nippur. In 1893, he was trying to decipher the inscription onwhat he believed was a ring from the temple of Bel. Exhausted by the fruitlesseffort, he fell asleep and dreamed that the priest of the temple of Bel showedhim the treasure chamber and explained that the ‘ring’ was part of a votivecylinder that had been cut into three. Ordered suddenly to make earrings forBel’s son Ninib, the priest had decided to carve up the cylinder. The thirdpart, said the priest, would never be found, but the second part was still inexistence.The next day, armed with the new information, Hilprecht found that his dream hadbeen correct. The second ring did exist among the catalogued items, and when thetwo parts were fitted together an inscription to the god Ninib could be read. Itwas later verified that the two rings had come from the treasure chamber of thetemple of Bel. As the priest in the dream said, the third part was neverlocated.Another twenty years would pass before a professor from Bryn Mawr named GeorgeAaron Barton assembled the fragments, scattered in three boxes. His discoveryinitially filled him with excitement. This was not a list of temple treasures,or even a hymn to Enlil, but a long, continuous narrative that deservedcomparison with Gilgamesh. It was, Barton thought, possibly the oldest text inthe world, and was nine tablets long. Barton ultimately concluded, though, thatthis was simply a version of the Sumerian creation myth. His translation of it,in a volume called Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions (1918),9 failed toexcite even his colleagues, still less the general public, which was moreconcerned with the end of the Great War.More than half a century passed before, in the 1970s, a copy of Barton’s bookfell into the hands of a geologist named Christian O’Brien, who had spent muchof his life working for British Petroleum in the Middle East. O’Brien had taughthimself to read cuneiform script, and as he looked at Barton’s translation andthe reproductions of the original texts, he concluded that Barton’sunderstanding left much to be desired. He set out to translate it himself.O’Brien discovered that, far from being a ‘creation myth’ featuring Sumeriangods, the text seemed to be a down-to-earth account of how a group called theAnunnaki, or Anannage, built an agricultural community called Kharsag on aplateau in a mountain region. This settlement was also known as Ehdin – which,as O’Brien points out, reminds us of Eden. Readers of Sitchin’s Earth Chronicleswill immediately recognise the Anunnaki as the beings from ‘the twelfth planet’Niburu, who, the author claims, came to earth nearly half a million years ago insearch of gold to be used (in some mysterious way) to protect their atmospherefrom deterioration. Sitchin finds the evidence for these space visitors in theOld Testament, and in various ancient Sumerian texts (although not the Kharsagfragments). He believes that they actually created man as a slave to do the hardwork of gold mining.Christian O’Brien and his wife and co-writer Barbara Joy rejected the spacemenhypothesis. They are students of Eastern religion, and are inclined to acceptthe existence of ‘astral planes’, realms of existence beyond solid matter, soalthough they never commit themselves to where the Anannage came from, theirbelief seems to be that it is something more like a ‘parallel dimension’.10 (Asimilar division of opinion exists in the world of those who study UFOphenomena. At the time they first excited attention, in the late 1940s, mostwriters on the subject thought that flying saucers were visitors from otherplanets; more recently, there is an increased acceptance of the view that ‘they’may be literally ‘extraterrestrial’ in the sense of being able to control a‘higher vibration rate’ and should not be thought of as purely material.)In 1986, the O’Briens brought out their account of the Kharsag inscriptions inThe Genius of the Few: The Story of Those Who Founded the Garden of Eden .11 Itis hardly surprising that, with its careful, scholarly and unsensationalapproach, it should have failed to make the impact of Sitchin or Velikovsky. Toocontroversial for the academics, it was too sober and erudite for the popularaudience who devoured ancient mysteries, but since that time it has attracted anincreasing number of readers.The title The Genius of the Few is a quotation from André Parrot, O’Brien’smentor in archaeology, who pointed out that the flame of Middle Easterncivilisation blazed up simultaneously in a number of places: Susa, Lagash, Ur,Uruk, Ashnunnak, Nineveh and Mari, ‘until, at last, thanks to the genius of thefew… there was wrought forth, as in an alchemist’s crucible, a prodigious,many-sided art’.What, ask the O’Briens, caused this simultaneous seeding of civilisation in somany places? They believe that the answer lies in the Anannage, or (as theyprefer to call them) the Shining Ones, whose name is explained in the secondchapter of The Genius of the Few. Why, O’Brien asks, does the Bible start withthe sentence ‘In the Beginning, God created the heavens and the earth’, when itsays that the Elohim created the heaven and earth? Elohim is plural, notsingular, so it should read ‘the gods created the heavens and the earth’. If theBible had meant God, it would have used the singular form ‘el’, which actuallymeans ‘shining’. It can be found in many ancient languages. In Sumerian it means‘brightness’. In Babylonian, ‘ellu’ means ‘Shining Ones’. Even our English word‘elf means a shining being, while in Cornwall – where I live – ‘el’ means an‘angel’ (in old Cornish).So the Bible is saying that ‘the Shining Ones’ who created heaven and earthsaid, ‘Let us make a man in our image.’ Yahweh, the leader of the Shining Ones,‘planted a garden in Eden’, and the prophet Enoch did not ‘walk with God’ butwith the Shining Ones.O’Brien makes another important point. The word ‘heavens’ – ‘ha’shemin’ –originally meant ‘the highlands’. And ‘earth’ – ‘ha’ares’ – means ‘the ground’or (in this context) the lowlands. So the Bible is actually saying that theseShining Ones (or angels) made the highlands and the lowlands, and the highlandsincluded the Garden of Eden.O’Brien also relates the story of the finding of the Kharsag material in Nippur,describing how it was unearthed from the Philadelphia museum basement by GeorgeBarton and translated as religious fragments, explaining why he found the Bartontranslation so unsatisfactory with lengthy quotations from the original text inAkkadian. O’Brien then tells the story of Kharsag after the Shining Ones haddescended to earth. And he makes it clear that he regards these Shining Ones asmore or less identical with the Watchers of the Book of Enoch.Since talking about ‘Shining Ones’ or ‘Watchers’ may confuse, I suggest thathere we refer to them simply as the civilisers, the ‘few’ whose genius createdcivilisation. The Kharsag epic makes it clear that they were not angels –otherwise they would surely have been immune to a plague that devastated Eden –but flesh and blood beings whose powers and talents were far beyond those of thehuman beings of the time.The leader of the civilisers was called Enlil – the name of the god in whosetemple the Kharsag cylinder was found. His wife, the Lady of Kharsag, was calledNinlil. They decided to name the settlement Edin, the Akkadian for ‘plateau’.Its other name, Kharsag, means ‘the lofty fenced enclosure’.In other words, the Shining Ones built the first agricultural settlement in aworld where human beings were primitive hunters. The spot they chose wassurrounded by mountains – O’Brien believes it was at the point where modernLebanon, Syria and Israel join. The time, the O’Briens believe, was about 8,200BC. On the plateau of Eden the civilisers built houses of cedar wood, made areservoir, and dug irrigation ditches. Enlil and other leaders among them hadGreat Houses, and there was even a maternity hospital. The surrounding hillswere covered with orchards, they planted grain, and harvests were so plentifulthat they allowed their neighbours to join the settlement and share the bounty.Although Enlil was recognised as the leader, Eden was run on democratic lines,with a council of seven. If we suppose that the civilisers were mortal, then wemust also assume that, over the 2,000 or so years that Kharsag existed, therewere many Enlils, and that it became a title like ‘king’.The Lady of Kharsag, Ninlil, is also referred to as the Serpent Lady, which ledGeorge Barton to assume that she was some kind of snake goddess. In fact, AndrewCollins cites another ancient fragment of text about the Watchers, whichdescribes one of them as having a ‘visage like a viper’. Collins is inclined tofeel that this suggests a hollow, gaunt face with slit-like eyes.This use of another ancient fragment of text offers an opportunity of raising aquestion that may be troubling some readers: why should anyone take seriouslythese strange tales and legends about lustful fallen angels and Shining Ones whoplanted the Garden of Eden? We recognise the stories about the Greek gods as nomore than myth; no one believes that Zeus really lived on Mount Olympus with hiswife Hera and spent half his time turning himself into a bull or a swan toseduce mortal maidens.One explanation is that the many different texts about – for example – Enoch orthe Watchers suggests that these stories were passed down by word of mouththrough many generations before they were written down. When we read the Iliad,we soon come to feel that this is not just an idle tale invented by a minstrelor bard: it is based on real events. And archaeological research leaves no doubtthat they occurred. The sheer number of ancient texts leaves little doubt thatthere were about a dozen different works about Enoch and the Watchers. As withthe Iliad, they have the ring of folk memory.As to the epic of Kharsag, it seems to tell a lengthy and detailed story thatalso has the ring of fact. For example, the story continues to tell how, aftercenturies of prosperity, harsh weather came to Eden, with storms, floods andbitter cold. Considered in the light of what we know happened at the end of thelast Ice Age, after 14,000 BC, when the climate fluctuated wildly and periods ofwarming were suddenly replaced again with much colder conditions, it seemslikely that Kharsag would find itself under siege to the weather.But it was more than just bad weather. There were tremendous storms, one ofwhich O’Brien describes as the thousand-year storm, and the House of Enlil wasdestroyed by fire. Perpetual darkness fell, and heavy, non-stop rain causedflooding. Enlil said, ‘My settlement is shattered… By water alone it has beendestroyed.’ But the final words of the lady Ninlil are perhaps the mostsignificant: ‘The Building of Learning is cut off… the creation of Knowledge isruined.’ Clearly, one of the major purposes of the settlement of Kharsag was tocreate knowledge. For the O’Briens, the Shining Ones were bringers of knowledgeto the human race.At this point, at the end of Tablet 9, the Kharsag epic breaks off. We do notknow how many more tablets remain undiscovered, but the O’Briens believe thatthe Shining Ones went on to become the civilisers of humanity and the foundersof Middle Eastern civilisation. In a later compilation called The ShiningOnes,12 which includes The Genius of the Few, they even suggested that thecivilisers played some part in the civilisation of Central and South America andAtlantis. It also states that ‘unquestionably, the most rewarding descriptionsof the Garden of Eden… occur in the Book of Enoch’. They speak at some length ofEnoch, suggesting that when he was taken by the angels to see the seven heavens,he actually visited Kharsag – the Garden of Eden. They point out that Enochvisited a Great House, that he described magnificent trees, and even the greatreservoir.We have already noted the passage from the Book of Enoch in which the angels aregiven long cords and sent off to ‘measure’. It is O’Brien’s view that the‘angels’ were laying out part of the Garden of Eden, perhaps the irrigationsystem, but for Rand the passage could bear a completely differentinterpretation. The angels hurried off to the north, and from the South Pole alldirections are north.As to why the angels should be making a survey, Rand thought he already knew onepossible answer. Having already concluded that a great number of the world’ssacred sites, such as Giza and Lhasa, were arranged on a symmetrical grid of‘sacred latitudes’, it seems likely that there had been some kind of worldwidesurvey. The same thing is suggested by Hapgood’s ancient maps, ranging fromChina to an Antarctica free of ice. It looks as if ancient peoples who existed‘before civilisation’ had an extraordinarily comprehensive knowledge of thesurface of our globe.Rand’s theory was that this survey was conducted by what was then the world’smost technically advanced civilisation, Atlantis, which was prompted by therecognition that some catastrophe was going to occur – almost certainlyinvolving a movement of the earth’s crust – and that its purpose was to find outhow far the crust mantle had already shifted. This, Rand felt, was why surveyorswould set out to ‘make a survey’.Hapgood believed that the crust movements that resulted in the shift of theNorth Pole from Hudson Bay to its present position began about 15,000 BC. Heseemed to feel that it had occurred slowly and, as it were, almost unnoticeably,although that is unlikely. The San Andreas Fault in California moves slowly, butthe occasional earthquakes it produces can be dramatically noticeable.Rand’s strong belief that the Atlanteans possessed a considerable knowledge ofgeology suggests that they must have studied the subject for a long time beforethe final catastrophe – perhaps for more than 2,000 years. In 9,600 BC, the tiltof the earth’s axis was far greater than it is today, and the end of the Ice Agewas marked by a great deal of flooding, so they would have had good reason topay attention to geology.Their efforts, as we know, proved to be a waste of time, at least if we acceptthat the final catastrophe destroyed their civilisation. But, Rand suggests,later generations, who came long after the catastrophe, saw the ‘markers’ laiddown by the ‘surveyors’, which they took for sacred sites, and went on to buildtheir own temples on these sites.It seemed to me that the evidence cited by Hapgood in Maps of the Ancient SeaKings, along with Rand’s own researches, pointed conclusively to some formerworldwide geographical knowledge.Uriel’s Machine, by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas, lends a certain supportto Rand’s (and the O’Briens’) ‘survey’ hypothesis, suggesting that Enoch knewall about the danger from the heavens. Uriel is one of the Watchers in the Bookof Enoch – not one of the rebels, but one of those sent to earth to punish them.A part of the Book of Enoch called the Book of the Heavenly Luminaries isbasically an astronomical treatise. At a certain point, Enoch is transportedtowards a mountain of ‘hard flint rock’ in the west: And I saw six portals inwhich the sun rises, and six portals in which the sun sets and the moon risesand sets… also many windows to the right and left of these portals.’13 Lomas andKnight were reminded of Stonehenge, with its ‘portals’ between the stoneuprights of the trilithons.In the early 1960s, the British astronomer Gerald Hawkins had started toinvestigate the possibility that Stonehenge might be a kind of Stone Agecomputer, constructed to calculate the moment of sunrise and moonrise over an18.6-year cycle. His Stonehenge Decoded (1965)14 became an immediate bestseller,although most astronomers were unconvinced. In fact, its ideas are now generallyaccepted, and in the 1970s the work of Professor Alexander Thom on ancient stonecircles lent support to Hawkins’s theory.The basic notion is that by standing in the centre of the circle you can facethe sunrise (or moonrise) and foretell the season according to its positionbehind the ‘markers’. Lomas and Knight decided to try and construct a ‘Urielmachine’ on a Yorkshire hilltop in what amounted to a simple observatory. Theyreturned repeatedly to take their observations of sunrise or sunset from thecentre of the ring to the horizon, and stuck markers in place. Persisting for ayear, they ended up with two curved rows of posts facing one another. And theylearned – as ancient ‘henge’ builders had learned – that the year is not neatlydivided into four by solstices and equinoxes. Because the earth’s orbit aroundthe sun is an ellipse, there are 182 sunrises from the winter to the summersolstice, but 183 from the summer to the winter solstice. The same disparity isfound between the spring and autumn equinoxes.Their observations enabled them to learn why the ancient monument builders –these ‘Stone Age Einsteins’ – had chosen as their unit of length what Thomcalled the ‘megalithic yard’ – 32.64 inches. (Thom admitted he had doubled thebasic unit that he found in all the megalithic sites – 16.32 inches – in orderto bring it closer to our modern yard.) Lomas and Knight found that their‘machine’ registered the length of the year as 366 days (between one wintersolstice and another), which led them to fix a ‘megalithic degree’, one-366thportion of the earth’s revolution. They set their posts a megalithic degreeapart, and found that a star took 3.93 minutes to move from one upright to thenext.The megalith builders almost certainly used a pendulum as their clock. The timea pendulum takes to complete one swing is determined by its length, and Lomasand Knight discovered that for the pendulum to swing 366 times in 3.93 minutesit had to be exactly 16.32 inches long, which is why the ‘StoneAge Einsteins’ chose 16.32 inches as their basic unit. Lomas and Knight hadsolved the problem that baffled Thom.Uriel’s ‘machine’ (amounting, in effect, to a primitive Woodhenge of posts)could not only be used as a calculator of sunrises and moonrises, but also as anobservatory for measuring comets. It could determine, quite simply, whether acomet was on course to hit the earth. In other words, Uriel’s ‘machine’ couldhave been used by the ancients as a catastrophe predictor.Rand certainly thought so, although his own view was that, rather than using theearth to measure the sky, Uriel’s machine had been designed to use the positionof the stars to monitor the movements of the inner earth, a kind of ancientseismic device that could be used to anticipate crust displacements.According to Rand’s theory, in Chapter 65 of the Book of Enoch, significantgeological events take place before the flood: And in those days Noah saw theearth, that it had sunk down and its destruction was nigh.’ At this point Enochsends an angel to warn Noah specifically about a coming global catastrophe: ‘Goto Noah and… reveal to him the end that is approaching: that the whole earthwill be destroyed, and a deluge is about to come upon the whole earth, and willdestroy all that is on it.’He began to suspect that the position of the sacred sites, scattered across thenorthern hemisphere at 5- and 10-degree intervals, would be an ideal way ofkeeping track of any geological changes within the Earth. We know that beforethe flood, Enoch observed the angels flying north to undertake measurements withcords.We recall that every year after the Nile flooded the Egyptian plains the priestsused knotted ‘cords’ to recalibrate boundaries. They also used cords asgeometric survey tools to design their temples. These ‘cords’ were nothing lessthan practical survey tools.Rand concluded that the survey was geological and that Uriel’s machine was atool used to anticipate the geological changes that were already building to acrisis when Noah pleaded for help from Enoch.If there were dozens of astronomical observatories located at known latitudes,such as the equator, 15 degrees north, 30 degrees north, and so on, then thecollated information from these ‘observatories’ would permit the people ofAtlantis to make an appraisal of the direction of the displacement. Forinstance, Giza, which was formerly at 15 degrees north and ended up at 30degrees north, would first pass through latitude 16 degrees north. Likewise,Easter Island, formerly on the equator, moved south until it reached its presentlocation at 27 degrees south by first passing through 1 degree south. And Lhasa,the spiritual capital of Tibet, passed through 1 degree north as it slid fromthe equator to its current latitude of 30 degrees north.Lomas and Knight’s ‘sophisticated horizon declinometer’ would also make an idealseismic monitor to detect any change in the earth’s crust or mantle. If theearth’s mantle began to move then the stars would appear out of place andUriel’s machine would spot the discrepancy. Our priest-scientist observers wouldknow that something was terribly amiss.When I checked with Robert Lomas, he replied that yes, indeed, Uriel’s machinecould be used to monitor changes within the earth. Although he noted that onlythe twelve first-magnitude stars (the brightest stars) would be useful, thosewould still be enough to accomplish the geological task.Based upon their studies of Freemasonry, Lomas and Knight had argued thatgeology was an ancient science like astronomy and geometry, so Rand’s notion ofAtlantean astronomers observing the heavens to determine the timing of the nextcatastrophe was a plausible one.It should be mentioned that Lomas and Knight also accept the idea ofcatastrophes resulting from cometary impact. For the impact that produced somuch damage in the Mediterranean area, which they believe to be the Biblicalflood, they prefer the date of 3,200 BC rather than 2,200 BC.For the ‘Atlantis flood’, they prefer 7,640 BC rather than the 9,600 BC thatRand and I have been suggesting in this book.An article on Uriel’s Machine by Damian Thompson15 quotes archaeologist TimSchadler-Hall as saying that in East Yorkshire there is an unbroken geologicalrecord of centuries before and after 7,460 BC but there is no sign of the gianttidal wave that is supposed to have swept Britain clear of all life and producedthe great salt lake of Salt Lake City.Uriel’s Machine leaves little doubt that a cometary impact could be calculatedweeks or even months before it happened. For example, Donati’s comet, namedafter the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati, was visible from June1858 to April 1859, which seems to support the ‘surveyor’ theory. In any case,if the Atlanteans had studied geology because of earthquakes and floods, thentheir ‘markers’ could have been in place for decades or centuries.As we read in the Kharsag tablets of the catastrophe that dispersed the‘civilisers’, we find ourselves wondering what might have caused it. Could ithave been one of these unexpected returns to ice age conditions that we havebeen discussing? That is possible, but human beings had survived ice ageconditions for more than 100,000 years, and there seems no good reason why theyshould not have simply ‘dug in’ and waited for things to improve.But what if these conditions were caused by a catastrophe such as a cometimpact? In that case, we have to date it to the time of Plato’s Atlantis, forthe later catastrophe suggested by astronomer Bill Napier (2,200 BC) would havetaken place well after the time of ancient Sumer and would postdate the Kharsagtablets. A 9,500 BC catastrophe would suggest that the whole ‘Garden of Eden’period occurred a great deal earlier.In From the Ashes of Angels, Andrew Collins has some interesting and importantspeculations. Collins was not entirely happy with O’Brien’s assumption that Edenwas in ‘the mountain-girt valleys where modern Lebanon, Syria and Israel nowadjoin’. O’Brien seems to have reached this conclusion because the Book of Enochsays that the rebel Watchers descended on Mount Hermon, near Damascus, but thereis no definite indication of the whereabouts of Enoch’s Garden of Eden. Collinsdiscovered other Mesopotamian texts that spoke of an abode of the gods to thenorth. One Akkadian text of the third millennium BC said that ‘Karsag Kurra’ wasa sacred mountain located immediately outside the northern limits of theircountry, Mesopotamia, which would seem to place it in Kurdistan. Collins wentthere to investigate.One reason that O’Brien chose the vicinity of Mount Hermon was that it had cedarforests (the famous ‘cedars of Lebanon’), with whose wood the civilisers builttheir settlement. Elsewhere in The Genius of the Few, O’Brien admits that thehigh mountain country where Kharsag was situated sounds like the ZagrosMountains of Luristan and Kurdistan. But he declares that the Zagros Mountainsare covered with oak trees, and have no history of cedars – which seems to leaveonly Lebanon as the site of Kharsag.In this, however, he was mistaken. Collins soon established that there had beencedar forests in the Zagros Mountains, and that they may have existed since theend of the Ice Age. Moreover, Collins pointed out that Genesis describes Godplanting a garden ‘eastward, in Eden’. East of what? Mount Hermon is not east ofanything except Lebanon and the Mediterranean. On the other hand, the whole areaaround Lake Van and Lake Urmia, where Kurdish and Armenian legends place boththe Garden of Eden and the landing place of Noah’s Ark, is to the east ofTurkey. The earliest version of Gilgamesh, written in Sumerian, places a greatcedar forest in the Zagros Mountains of Kurdistan.Moreover, Collins learned about an ancient Anatolian (Turkish) city named NevaliCori, whose carved columns at first sight looked like those of the vastcourtyard called the Kalasasiya, at Tiahuanaco, in the Andes. They were theremains of a monolithic temple that seemed to be a ritual centre, parts of whichwere carbon-dated back to 8,400 BC. He would later come to suspect a connectionbetween the Watchers of Enoch and the stories of Viracocha, the god who broughtcivilisation to Central and South America, and the cult of the plumed serpentQuetzalcoatl (the other name for Viracocha).Collins went to the Kurdistan plateau in eastern Turkey in search of the Gardenof Eden, and soon had no doubt that all the information about it in the Kharsagepic pointed to the Zagros Mountains. Rand disagreed. The blueprint suggeststhat the O’Briens got it right when they associated Kharsag with the Lebanesevillage of Ehdin, near Mount Hermon and Baalbek (see Chapter 8).In his quest, Collins and a friend visited Cappadocia, in eastern Turkey, anddiscovered a kind of lunar landscape of hardened lava, mostly from the volcanoof Erciyas Dag. The landscape is full of towers created by wind erosion. EarlyChristians tunnelled into them to make hermits’ cells and chapels. This area wasalso where Catal Huyuk, one of the earliest cities in the world, flourishedabout 8,000 years ago.After they looked at many of these early ‘churches’, the guide suggested thatthey might like to see the ‘underground cities’. ‘What underground cities?’Collins asked. The guide explained that they were made by Christians who weretrying to escape persecution by Muslims in the time of Mohammed. He drove themto a village called Kaymakli, where a subterranean city had been discovered in1964. It was a kind of underground tenement, with several levels and corridors10 feet wide and 6.5 feet high. Doorways were closed by huge round stones thatcould be ‘locked’ from the inside. It seemed that the builders of thesehigh-ceilinged rooms were (for that time) exceptionally tall. Anotherunderground city had been discovered beneath the town of Derinkuyu, it had nofewer than eight ‘storeys’, although, in spite of ventilation shafts, it wascompletely invisible from the ground above. It was big enough to hold apopulation of 20,000.As I read Collins’s account, I recalled that I had seen something about thesecities – there are thirty-six of them – in a book by Erich von Däniken calledAccording to the Evidence. Predictably, von Däniken’s theory was that the localinhabitants had been visited by extraterrestrials, who departed afterthreatening that they would return and punish those who did not continue to obeytheir orders, so the locals had retreated underground.Even if the notion of extraterrestrials was accepted, this idea does not seemcredible, since the inhabitants would have needed food, which had to be grownabove ground, and cultivated fields – with cattle – would have revealed theirwhereabouts. The same applies to the guide’s explanation that Christians hadtaken refuge in these cities to hide from Muslims. To ‘hide’ in such placeswould be simply to be caught like rats in a trap.In fact, there could only be one purpose in building such a city underground: toescape the temperature of the air above ground. In stiflingly hot summers andfreezing winters, the temperature in the underground cities remained around 8degrees celsius.Collins says there is geological evidence that Turkey was plunged into amini-ice age for about 500 years in the middle of the ninth millennium BC. Thismade more sense. If the landscape was covered with snow and ice and scoured byfreezing winds, an underground city would be as comfortable as a Hobbit hole.The local archaeologist, Omer Demir, told Collins that he believed that theoldest parts of the ‘city’ dated to the late Palaeolithic Era, perhaps 8,500 BC.Older parts were hewn out with stone tools, not metal. Moreover, it had beenmade by two types of human being, and those who carved the oldest part were muchtaller than the others – again, they had made their ceilings higher.We have seen that it is conceivable that the break-up of the Kharsag communitythrough a return of ice age conditions could have occurred earlier than theO’Briens believed – that is, before 10,000 BC. O’Brien had worked out his datefor the founding of Kharsag, about 8,200 BC, from the fact that the cedars ofLebanon had existed from about that time. If he was wrong about Kharsag beingsituated in Lebanon, then that date was purely arbitrary. If Kharsag wasaffected by the 9,600 BC catastrophe, and it had flourished for over 2,000 years(as O’Brien believes), that would push its foundation back to perhaps 11,500 BC.Is it not possible that work began on the subterranean cities at that time?Collins cites a Persian legend in which a shepherd called Yima is told by God tobuild a ‘var’ – an underground city or fortress – to protect men and animalsfrom freezing conditions brought about by an evil demon. Nearly 2,000 humanbeings are to be taken into the city for their protection.Could this legend also be referring to the underground cities of Cappadocia?There was a strong connection between Cappadocia and Kurdistan, and also betweenKurdistan and its neighbour Persia, in which case there is an arguableconnection between these subterranean cities and the end of the last ice age.Subsequently, the earth then had to contend with yet another catastrophe in acomet that split into ‘seven burning mountains’ and caused a disastrous flood,accompanied by worldwide volcanic activity. Collins argues that this catastrophecould be reflected in the words of a version of the Book of Enoch found amongthe Dead Sea Scrolls, which states that the rebel Watchers were finallydestroyed by ‘fire, naphtha and brimstone’.There seems to be an obvious objection to this notion: surely the Kharsag epicwould have mentioned the ‘seven mountains’ ? But the Kharsag epic is anunfinished fragment, which ends (on tablets 8 and 9) with the long winter andthe great storm. We do not know what might have been described on other tablets.Perhaps tablets 10 and 11 now lie in the basement of some Iraqi museum, or evenunderground, like the missing tablets of Gilgamesh, waiting for discovery byanother George Smith.I have already noted that Andrew Collins is inclined to suspect a connectionbetween the ‘civilisers’ of Eden and the ‘god’ Viracocha, who brought knowledgeto Central and South America. He also links them with ancient Egypt. Collinsaccepts – as I do myself – that Egyptian civilisation probably dates backthousands of years before the pharaohs.Collins notes that among the Anannage who built Kharsag there is a council ofseven, and that in the Edfu ‘building texts’ the Seven Sages are divine beingswho organise the building of the temples and sacred places. Graham Hancockwrites of them:This context [describing the sages] is marked by a preponderance of ‘Flood’imagery in which the ‘primeval waters’ (out of which the Great Primeval Moundemerged) are depicted as gradually receding. We are reminded of Noah’smountaintop on which the Ark settled after the Biblical Deluge, and of the‘Seven Sages’ (Apkallu) of ancient Babylonian tradition who were said to have‘lived before the Flood’ and to have built the walls of the sacred city of Uruk.Likewise is it an accident that in Indian tradition ‘Seven Sages’ (rishis) areremembered to have survived the Flood, their purpose being to pass down tofuture generations the wisdom of the antediluvian world? In all cases the sagesappear as the enlightened survivors of a cataclysm that wiped the earth clean…17Hancock says that the Seven Sages come from an island that was destroyed by aflood, and that the majority of its divine inhabitants were drowned. The SevenSages then moved on to Egypt. We might bear in mind that the island calledDilmun, which appears in Sumerian and Akkadian mythology, is a paradise thatsounds remarkably like a variant of the Garden of Eden.The Edfu texts and Pyramid texts tell us that these Seven Sages were also knownas the ‘followers of Horus’ (Shemsu Hor) and that they rebuilt the world afterthe great catastrophe. Since we are dealing with the relatively small area ofthe Middle East, it seems, to say the least, not unlikely that the Seven Sagesof Egypt are the seven councillors of Kharsag.These speculations are related to Rand’s observations on the geography of sacredsites (see Appendix 5). He notes that the O’Briens and Andrew Collins are inagreement that several sites in the Middle East were linked with the ShiningOnes – Baalbek, Byblos and Ehdin in Lebanon, Jericho near Jerusalem, Catal Huyukin Turkey, Edfu in Egypt and finally Nippur, the religious capital of ancientSumer. He commented in an email to me:If the Shining Ones were undertaking geological surveys at these sites beforethe Flood then they should fit into the Atlantis Blueprint.Baalbek is perhaps the most impressive site in the Middle East because of thegigantic blocks of stone used in the construction of a platform that was laterto become a temple dedicated to the Roman god, Jupiter. In John Anthony West’saward-winning documentary The Mystery of the Sphinx, he showed just howdifficult it was even for modern engineers using the largest cranes in the worldto move objects weighing 200 tons. The blocks used in construction at Baalbekare much larger than those found in Egypt.Andrew Collins comments on their sheer weight: An outer podium wall, popularlyknown as the Great Platform, is seen by scholars as contemporary to the Romantemples. Yet incorporated into one of its courses are the three largest buildingblocks ever used in a man-made structure. Each one weighs an estimated 1,000tonnes apiece. They sit side-by-side on the fifth level of a truly cyclopeanwall located beyond the western limits of the Temple of Jupiter. These threestones are called the Trilithon. Even if they did not exist and we were leftwith the six blocks of stone that lie beneath them, we would still be looking atblocks weighing in excess of 450 tonnes. The course beneath the Trilithon isalmost as bewildering. It consists of six mammoth stones thirty to thirty-threefeet in length, fourteen feet in height and ten feet in depth, each an estimated450 tonnes in weight.’Collins is highly sceptical of the claim by some scholars that the Romans wereresponsible for the Great Platform and remarks: ‘Nowhere in extant Roman recordsdoes it mention anything at all about the architects and engineers involved inthe construction of the Great Platform. No contemporary Roman historian orscholar comments on how it was constructed, and there are no tales that preservethe means by which the Roman builders achieved such marvellous feats ofengineering.’Instead, Andrew Collins looks to the mythology of the people who live in theBequa’a Valley. Theirs is a very different tale: ‘They say that Baalbek’s firstcity was built before the Great Flood by Cain, the son of Adam, whom Godbanished to the “land of Nod” that lay “east of Eden,” for murdering his brotherAbel, and he called it after his son Enoch. The citadel, they say, fell intoruins at the time of the deluge and was much later re-built by a race ofgiants.’18So, says Rand, according to local traditions there have been at least twoancient periods of construction at Baalbek: one well before the flood (since itwas undertaken by Cain who flourished before Enoch who was in turn thegreatgrandfather of Noah), the second long after the flood, when a race ofgiants occupied the site. Rand, like Collins, believes that, like so many sacredplaces around the world, Baalbek was simply appropriated by later generations,in this case Roman.Rand’s next thought was to compare Baalbek’s location to the Hudson Bay Pole:I discovered that it was situated at 10 phi distance from the equator. I knewthat the largest stones used in construction in the New World were in and aroundCuzco, which also had been at a 10 phi latitude before the flood. Sitchin hadcommented upon the similarities between Baalbek and Cuzco and now we knew thatboth sites shared the same sacred latitude.I was intrigued by this development and it occurred to me that the geologicalsurvey of Enoch’s ‘angels’ might have marked off the distance to earlierpositions of the earth’s crust/mantle. I decided to see how Baalbek related tothe Greenland Sea Pole (before 50,600 BC) and the Yukon Pole (before 91,600 BC)(see Appendix 4).Rand’s theory of sacred sites is based on the notion that, as Hapgood himselfimplies, the Atlanteans were a central part – perhaps the central part – of aworldwide maritime civilisation that extended as far as China, so it is highlyprobable that they had conducted a worldwide survey decades or centuries beforethe catastrophe of 9,600 BC. Rand suggests they were trying to understand theperiodic earthquakes and volcanic activity that had been devastating theircountry for a long time (there is a persistent tradition that Atlantis sufferedthree catastrophes, and was destroyed by the third).We have to suppose that the Atlanteans knew the earth’s crust had been movingfor a considerable time – Hapgood thinks 15,000 BC – and were aware of its rateof movement and direction. (O’Brien’s suggestion that the ‘civilisers’ hadcarried their knowledge to Atlantis would certainly lend plausibility to thisnotion.) They also, if this theory is correct, knew the position of the NorthPole before it began to move, and we have to suppose that they had built certain‘markers’ – perhaps stone circles, Uriel’s machines – to measure this movement.What Rand discovered, when he measured the position of Baalbek against previouspoles, was unequivocal. The position of the Yukon Pole and the Greenland SeaPole also gave significant figures.This was when the mystical number seven showed up. During the Greenland Sea PoleBaalbek was located at 49 degrees north (7x7). But the real surprise came whenRand compared Baalbek to the Yukon Pole. When the North Pole was situated in theYukon, a time that reached back almost 100,000 years, Baalbek was located atexactly 7 degrees north."},{"pageContent":"8GOLDEN SECTION SITESWHEN I FIRST read Rand’s original outline of his theory, only one part caused metwinges of doubt: the section on Rennes-le-Château, the tiny French village inLanguedoc where a poor village priest had discovered coded documents in a hollowpillar in his church and had suddenly become wealthy.A year earlier, my friend Lynn Picknett had sent me the typescript of her bookThe Templar Revelation (1997) (co-authored with Clive Prince).1 She seemed tofeel that part of the modern ‘evidence’ was little more than a hoax.The previous autumn, I had been sent for review a book called The Tomb of God(1996),2 whose authors, Richard Andrews and Paul Schellenberger, had no doubtsabout the truth of the Rennes-le-Château saga and believed that their researcheshad revealed the burial site of Jesus Christ in the Pyrenees. A BBC programme onthe book exploded their theory so savagely that the authors (who had taken partin it apparently under the belief that their book was being taken seriously)must have felt as if they had stood on a landmine.About this time I also read a book called The Key to the Sacred Pattern (1997)3by Henry Lincoln – the man who had started the avalanche of interest inRennes-le-Château nearly thirty years before – and I realised that I was wrong:the mystery had not been exploded. Not only was the story of Rennes-le-Châteauas baffling as ever, but the geometry of the area provided some of the mostconvincing proof so far of Rand’s ‘geodetic’ theory of sacred sites and his viewthat ancient people possessed sophisticated surveying skills.In 1969, the name of Rennes-le-Château was unknown, even to most of the touristswho love Languedoc and its ancient historical sites. Most of those who wentthere made for the walled town of Carcassonne, the breeding ground of a medievalheresy called Catharism, which preached that ‘this world’ was created by theDevil and that everything to do with matter is evil (a creed also known asManicheeism). The Cathars were bloodily suppressed when a huge army invaded theregion in 1209, murdering them by the thousand. In 1244, they made their laststand in the citadel of Montségur, situated on a mountain top, and 200 of themwere finally burned alive on a huge pyre.In the last days of the siege, four men had escaped from the citadel by night,carrying the ‘treasure’ of the Cathars – two months earlier, another two Catharshad escaped with even more treasure. I had visited the citadel years ago, andcan still recall that precipitous and exhausting climb. Was it possible that theparchment discovered in the church pillar had led the priest to the treasure ofthe Cathars, and that this had made him a wealthy man?Henry Lincoln was a writer of television drama scripts when he first stumbled onthe mystery in 1969. On holiday with his wife and children in a French farmhousein the Cevennes, he picked up a paperback called Le Trésor Maudit4 – The CursedTreasure – by a man called Gérard de Sède. It told the story of the simplevillage priest called Bérenger Saunière, who was thirty-three years old when hecame to Rennes-le-Château in 1885. He was very poor – the income on which hesupported himself and a housekeeper was about six pounds sterling a year.Some time thereafter, a wealthy female parishioner, the Countess de Chambord,gave Saunière 3,000 francs to repair the church – the date may have been 1886 or1891, according to different accounts. It was during the repairs that a workmanfound four wooden cylinders containing rolls of paper inside a square Visigothicpillar that held up the altar stone. Two of the papers proved to be genealogiesof local families, allegedly linking them with the Merovingians, a dynasty ofkings that had ruled France – less than successfully – from the fifth to theeighth centuries AD. The other two were Latin texts from the New Testament, butwritten without spaces between the words.They were fairly obviously in code – in fact, the code of the shorter text wasso straightforward that Henry Lincoln worked it out at a glance as he looked atthe reproduction in de Sède’s book. Some letters were raised above the others,and when these were written down consecutively they read: ? Dagobert II roi et àSion est ce tresor et il est là mort’ – ‘This treasure belongs to King DagobertII and to Sion, and he is there dead’. Sion was Jerusalem, and the last phrasecould also mean ‘and it is death’. Dagobert was a seventh-century French king ofthe Merovingian dynasty who had lived at Rennes-le-Château in the far-off dayswhen it was a flourishing town. The author of these parchments was probably apredecessor of Saunière named Antoine Bigou, who had been curé ofRennes-le-Château at the time of the French Revolution.Saunière took the parchments to his bishop, who was intrigued enough to send himto Paris to consult with various scholars. There he went along to the church ofSt Sulpice, and talked with its director, Abbé Bieil. He also met Bieil’snephew, a young trainee priest named Emile Hoffet, who was involved in a circleof ‘occultists’ who flourished in Paris in the 1890s (some of whom Huysmansportrayed in his ‘Satanist’ novel Là Bas). Hoffet introduced Saunière to acircle of writers and artists that included the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, thedramatist Maurice Maeterlinck, and the composer Claude Debussy. Saunière also –probably through Debussy – met the famous soprano Emma Calvé, and probablybecame her lover (he was far from ascetic).Before leaving Paris, Saunière visited the Louvre and bought reproductions ofthree paintings, one of which was Nicholas Poussin’s Les Bergers d’Arcadie –‘The Shepherds of Arcadia’ – which shows three shepherds and a shepherdessstanding in front of a tomb on which are carved the words ‘Et in Arcadia Ego’,usually translated ‘I (death) am also in Arcadia’.Back in Rennes-le-Château, three weeks later, he hired workmen to raise a stoneslab set in the floor in front of the altar – it dated from around the time ofDagobert II. They discovered two skeletons and ‘a pot of worthless medallions’.Saunière sent his helpers away, and spent the evening in the church alone. Hethen committed an odd piece of vandalism on a grave in the churchyard – that ofa distinguished lady named Marie de Blanchefort – and obliterated its twoinscriptions.He was unaware that the inscriptions had already been published in a little bookby a local antiquary. One contains the words ‘Et in Arcadia Ego’ (in a mixtureof Greek and Latin letters) on either side. The other is curious in that itcontains four unexplained lower-case letters, three e’s, two p’s and fourcapitals, TMRO. From the small letters only one word can be formed – épée,‘sword’ – while from the capitals the only word that emerges is MORT, ‘death’.Epée proved to be the ‘key word’ to decipher the second parchment Saunière hadfound in the column.And suddenly Saunière was rich. He constructed a public road to replace the dirtroad to the village, as well as a water tower. And he built himself a villa witha garden, and a Gothic[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_019_r1.jpg]The ‘obliterated’ tombstone.tower to house his library. Distinguished visitors came regularly, includingEmma Calvé and the Austrian Archduke Johann von Habsburg, the cousin of EmperorFranz-Josef. His many guests were superbly fed and wined by his young peasanthousekeeper, Marie Denarnaud.A new – and less friendly – bishop became curious about the source of Saunière’swealth. When Saunière refused to divulge its source – saying merely that it wasfrom a wealthy penitent who insisted on anonymity – the bishop orderedSaunière’s transfer to another parish. Saunière refused to be transferred, andanother priest was appointed in his place. (Oddly enough, when the bishop tookhis complaint to Rome, the Pope found in Saunière’s favour…) In 1905 the Frenchgovernment – which was anticlerical – began to make his life uncomfortable byaccusing him of being an Austrian spy. It seems that part of his regular incomecame from Austria.In 1917, Saunière died of cirrhosis of the liver; he was sixty-five. The priestwho attended his deathbed is said to have been so shocked at his finalconfession that he refused to administer extreme unction.His housekeeper lived on in the villa, and died in 1953. She had sold the villain 1946; she told its purchaser that one day she would tell him a secret thatwould make him rich and powerful, but a stroke left her speechless.This was the remarkable story that Henry Lincoln had read in Gérard de Sède’sbook. There were obviously many questions. Had Saunière found some of thetreasure of the Cathars who died at Montségur? Or had he learned some secretthat led certain wealthy patrons to wish to silence him with large sums ofmoney? Was he a blackmailer, or simply a member of a small group who shared someclosely guarded secret? There was yet another possibility – that the treasuremight have been that of the Templars, the medieval order of knights whopossessed immense wealth and influence during the twelfth and thirteenthcenturies, and was destroyed virtually overnight.The Templars are so called because their original headquarters was in thebasement of Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem (or rather, the remains of the Temple,which was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70, only four years after Herod hadrebuilt it). Jerusalem fell to Christian knights in 1099, as a result of theFirst Crusade. Twenty years later, nine French knights from the area of Troyesapproached King Baldwin II of Jerusalem, and told him they had sworn to protectthe roads and make them safe for Christian pilgrims; they asked if they couldestablish a home on the Temple Mount, and Baldwin gave them a plot of land thatincluded the Temple’s ‘basement’, which they turned into a stable.Oddly enough, the nine knights showed no sign of organising themselves toprotect pilgrims (and in any case nine men would hardly have formed an effectivepatrol). Instead they spent the next seven years excavating their ‘stable’, andscarcely ever ventured outside. They were obviously looking for something. Oneof their tunnels was found by Israeli archaeologists in the 1970s.But searching for what? When the Romans destroyed the Temple in AD 70, they hadcarried off its treasures. Could the remains of that treasure have beenconcealed under the Temple? Or were they looking for something else?In The Sign and the Seal (1992),5 Graham Hancock has an interesting speculation.As we saw in the last chapter, the Ethiopians claimed that the Ark of theCovenant had been taken to their country in the time of King Solomon, in thetenth century BC, but the truth is probably that it vanished from the Temple inthe reign of a king named Manasseh (687–642 BC), who, according to the Bible,‘did evil in the sight of the Lord’ and introduced a graven image into theTemple.With remarkable detective work, Hancock traced the purported route of the Arkfrom Jerusalem to a church in Axum, in Ethiopia. The priests in charge of theArk’ have consistently refused to allow it to be examined, but a recent bookalleges that they have admitted that what they guard is actually a box thathouses post-Christian copies of the Tables of the Law brought down by Moses fromSinai.6Hancock’s suggestion is that the Templars were searching for the Ark, whichlegend declared had been hidden in a secret room below its sacred chamber whenBabylonians burst into Solomon’s Temple in 587 BC to destroy it and drag theJews into their Babylonian captivity.Why would the nine knights have wanted the Ark? Presumably because, in that ageof faith, when holy relics were venerated (and brought immense wealth to thechurch or abbey that possessed them), the ownership of the world’s holiestobject would make the order that possessed it the most powerful in the world.Whatever they were searching for, the knights do not seem to have found it. In1126, seven years after starting their excavations, Hugh de Payens, theirleader, returned to France. It looked as if the attempt to found an order hadbeen a failure.Then a rescuer appeared. Bernard of Clairvaux, later St Bernard, was aCistercian and one of France’s most powerful churchmen, even though he firmlyrefused to be promoted above the rank of abbot. He was also the nephew of one ofthe knights, André de Montbard, who had accompanied Payens back to France. Twoyears later, a synod was convened in the town of Troyes, whose purpose was topersuade the Church to back the founding of the Order of Knights Templar. Thiscame about in 1128, when the ‘Order of the Poor Soldiers of Christ and theTemple of Solomon’ was founded and made answerable only to the Pope. And withthe support of St Bernard, recruits and money poured in, until the Templarsbecame the richest order in Europe.What happened? An association that is about to dissolve itself in 1126 becomesrich and powerful in a few years. What did Hugh de Payens and André de Montbardsay to St Bernard to enlist such support? Was it simply a friendly act on behalfof his uncle? Or did the knights tell Bernard of important and fascinatingdiscoveries they had made under the Temple?Hancock hazards the interesting guess that the knights had something to offerBernard in return for his support: Gothic architecture. Before that time, themajor style of church architecture was Romanesque, a style with rounded archessupported on short, thick pillars. This was for purely practical reasons. Thesheer weight of the ceilings and upper levels of a church meant that the weightpushed downward on the pillars and tended to make the walls bulge outward sothat they often collapsed. Then architects solved the problem. Ceilings weremade thinner and supported on ‘ribs’, and the arches were made narrower andhigher – typically Gothic. The first abbey to use this new Gothic style was StDenis in Paris, under a great innovator, Abbot Suger. The thinner walls –supported by flying buttresses – allowed more space for windows, one of the mostfamous examples being the stained glass of Chartres, built later in the century(with the active encouragement of St Bernard).Hancock wonders if it is possible that the Templars learned the secret of Gothicarchitecture in the vaults of Solomon’sTemple. This is not, of course, to suggest that Solomon’s Temple was built inthe Gothic style, but the Temple was famous for its beauty and harmony, and theknights may have stumbled upon some of the essential principles of Gothicarchitecture while they were there.However, there is a problem of dating. According to Encyclopaedia Britannica,architects began to solve the problem of the arches in 1120, when the nineknights had been excavating for only two years. This does not invalidate thetheory – St Denis, the first Gothic abbey, was not started until 1140. And asRand pointed out, the decline of Gothic architecture in the next few centurieswas as obvious and inexplicable as the decline of pyramid building in thecenturies immediately after the Giza pyramids had been built. The implicationwould be that in both cases, some tremendous injection of energy and inspirationcreated almost superhuman works of architecture and then ran out of steam.Hancock has another, equally fascinating theory. The town of Troyes, in whichthe Templars received the support of the Church, was the home of the authorChrétien de Troyes, the poet who, between 1165 and 1182, was responsible for thefirst great literary treatments of the legend of King Arthur. He was the firstto write about the Holy Grail – Hancock goes as far as to say that he inventedthe Holy Grail. Hancock suggests that the idea arose from the stories of the Arkof the Covenant, which Chrétien may have heard direct from Templar knights, andhe cites the scholar Helen Adolf, who thought that another early Grailchronicler, Wolfram von Eschenbach, who wrote Parzifal, derived his version ofthe Grail – a stone – from the Kebra Nagast of Abyssinia. It is a fascinatingidea, but seems to be contradicted by the opinion of various scholars, to theeffect that stories of the Grail had been sung by minstrels long before Chrétienwrote them down.7Why does this matter? It is important to bear in mind that the Templars were notsimply seeking power – they soon acquired it in abundance — but that they beganwith a search for some mystery object, possibly the Ark, and that the Templarorder was thereafter associated with the notion of a mystery, a belief that haspersisted down to modern times.The Second Crusade was initiated by Bernard of Clairvaux after the fall ofEdessa in 1144, but it ended in failure; the Moslems under Saladin were torecapture Jerusalem in 1187. During the next century, seven more crusades failedto restore power to the Christians. The fall of Acre in 1291 completed theirdefeat, and the Knights Templar lost their raison d’être.But they did not lose their power — or their wealth (based partly on exemptionfrom taxes). With a new Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, they licked their woundson the island of Cyprus and wondered what to do next. The problem was thatCyprus was insecure, with the Moslems raiding Limassol and taking captives whohad to be ransomed. The Templars considered returning to France, but there wereproblems. King Philip the Fair (1265—1314) was in conflict with Pope BonifaceVIII, and since the Templars regarded the Pope as their master, their return toFrance would be unwelcome to the king.In fact, the whole order was unwelcome to the king, who felt they were — liketheir papal master — arrogant nuisances (this may have been because he had onceapplied to join them, and been rejected). When the Pope threatened to deposePhilip, the king denounced Boniface as a heretic, and finally had him takenprisoner in his own house; Boniface died soon after being rescued.When his successor, Boniface IX, showed signs of taking up the struggle whereBoniface VIII left off, Philip arranged to have him poisoned, then had his owncandidate, Archbishop Bertrand de Gotte of Bordeaux, placed on the papal throne.Philip laid down a number of preconditions for supporting Bertrand’s candidacy,one being that the new Pope should move the seat of the papacy to France.Another precondition was held in reserve and has never been revealed. Mostscholars have concluded that the secret clause included a stipulation that thePope should not oppose his plan to arrest the Templars and seize their money.Bertrand became Pope Clement V in 1305, and the king immediately began to planone of the most amazing coups in history. It was to arrest all the Templars —15,000 of them — and accuse them of heresy. It could be compared to a modernking plotting to arrest all the officers in the army, navy and air force.Incredibly, it succeeded. Sealed orders went out about four weeks before theswoop, and the Templars were arrested on Friday 13 October 1307.*The Templars were accused of homosexuality, worshipping a demon called Baphometand spitting on the cross. Under appalling tortures — such as being held overred hot braziers — many confessed, including the Grand Master Jacques de Molayhimself. But at their sentencing on 18 March 1314, Molay withdrew hisconfession, declaring that it had been forced from him by torture. The king wasso enraged at having his plans thwarted that he immediately ordered Molay andhis friend Geoffrey de Charney, who also withdrew his confession, to be roastedalive over a slow fire.This took place on the following day, on an island in the Seine called the Ilede Palais. It is said that Molay summoned the king and the Pope to meet himbefore the throne of God within a year. Whether this is true or not, hecertainly called upon God to avenge his death. Within three months, both weredead — Philip gored by a boar during hunting, Clement of a fever.The irony is that, in a sense, Philip had committed this act of savagery fornothing. He had been hoping to replenish his treasury — depleted by war — withthe wealth of the Templars,It is also known that on the day before the Templars were arrested, 12 October1307, eighteen ships sailed out of La Rochelle, the Templars’ port. No one knowswhat became of them; they vanished from history. But at least one of these shipsseems to have made its way to Scotland, where part of the wealth it carried wentinto the building of a remarkable chapel called Rosslyn, near Edinburgh. (It isalso worth bearing in mind that Hugh de Payens was married to a Scotswomancalled Catherine de St Clair, whose descendants later built Rosslyn.)Whether or not the wealth of Bérenger Saunière was part of a Templar treasurewill never be known for certain, although Henry Lincoln is fairly sure he knows.What is certain is that there were two major Templar strongholds close toRennes-le-Château – Bezu and Blanchefort – and that Philip the Fair failed toseize the wealth of either of them.Back in 1969, after Henry Lincoln discovered Gérard de Sède’s book on hisholiday in the Cevennes, he returned to London and succeeded in interesting afriend at the BBC in the story. The two of them went to Rennes-le-Château, andeven on that first visit it began to look as if they were being observed. Forexample, in the neighbouring village of Rennes-les-Bains Lincoln found a springcalled the Lover’s Fountain; close by was a rock bearing a heart pierced by anarrow, and underneath it were the words E. Calvé, 1891. Emma Calvé was thebeautiful soprano who allegedly counted Saunière among her many lovers, and 1891was the year he is supposed to have discovered the parchments. Lincolnphotographed the inscription, but when he returned on the morrow, to photographit by better light, the inscription had been hacked from the rock.Gérard de Sède had agreed to act as a consultant on the programme, and was ableto provide the key to decoding the second mystery parchment. It was anincredibly complex code, which involved a technique known to cipher experts asthe Vigenère process. The alphabet is written twenty-six times, the firstbeginning with A, the second B, the third C, and so on. The key words MORT EPEEare placed over the parchment, and the letters are transformed using theVigenère table.The ‘noble Marie de Blanchefort’ text (which Saunière had tried to destroy) isthen used as another key phrase, and finally the letters are placed on a chessboard and a series of knight’s moves produces a message that may be translated:SHEPHERDESS WITHOUT TEMPTATION TO WHICH POUSSIN AND TENIERS HOLD THE KEY PEACE681 WITH THE CROSS AND THIS HORSE OF GOD I REACH THIS DEMON GUARDIAN AT MIDDAYBLUE APPLES.This, presumably, is what led Saunière to the treasure, although it is hard tosee how.The Marie inscription ends with the letters PS. This, Lincoln learned from deSède, stood for an organisation called the Priory of Sion. In the BibliothèqueNationale in Paris, Lincoln found that a number of pamphlets and documents hadbeen deposited since 1956, many written under pseudonyms such as Anthony theHermit’. One spoke about a secret order called the Priory of Sion, giving a listof its Grand Masters, which included the alchemist Nicolas Flamel (reputed tohave made gold), Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, Claude Debussy and, morerecently, Jean Cocteau. Saunière, we recall, had met Debussy on the trip toParis. And according to these documents – collectively known as the SecretDossier – the Priory of Sion was the inner hierarchy of the Knights Templar.And, the Secret Dossier claimed, thePriory continued to exist even after the Templars were destroyed.This suggested a new possibility, noted by another investigator, LionelFanthorpe, as well as by Henry Lincoln: perhaps Saunière had not found atreasure, only a secret – a secret worth a great deal of money.Many known facts support this conclusion. According to Henry Buthion, who ownedthe hotel that was once Saunière’s Villa Bethanie, Saunière was often short ofcash, and failed to pay 5,000 francs that he owed the makers of some expensivefurniture he had ordered. He certainly died penniless, but that may have beenbecause he simply allowed large sums of money to be paid direct to hishousekeeper, Marie Denardaud. Still, a man with a hidden treasure does not runshort of cash, even if he banks it.Eventually, Lincoln’s television programme was made and broadcast under thetitle The Lost Treasure of Jerusalem .8 By then, so much material had come tolight that it was clear that a second programme was going to be required.Perhaps the most intriguing clue of all came soon after the programme wastransmitted. A retired Church of England vicar wrote to tell Lincoln that the‘treasure’ was not gold or jewels, but a document proving that Jesus was notcrucified in AD 33, but had still been alive in AD 45.Lincoln went to visit him. The clergyman obviously wished he had kept his mouthshut, but he finally admitted that his information had come from an Anglicanscholar named Canon Alfred Lilley. And – Lincoln’s heart must have leaped as heheard this – Lilley had maintained close contact with scholars based at StSulpice, and had known Emile Hoffet, who had introduced Saunière to Debussy.This obviously raised a fascinating possibility. If Debussy was, indeed, a GrandMaster of the Priory of Sion, could he have shared the belief that Jesus did notdie on the cross? And was that Saunière’s secret, which so shocked the priestwho listened to his final confession?It certainly began to look more and more as if this was the answer. We mayrecall that when Saunière left Paris, he purchased some copies of paintings fromthe Louvre, among them Les Bergers d’Arcadie, which shows three shepherds and ashepherdess standing by a tomb bearing the words ‘Et in Arcadia Ego’.While they were filming the first programme, de Sède told Lincoln that theactual tomb used in the painting had been discovered at Arques, not far fromRennes-le-Château. In fact, the tomb, although it had no Latin inscription, wasotherwise identical, even to the stone on which the shepherd is resting his footin the painting.Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665) was one of the most distinguished painters of histime; although born in Normandy it was in Rome that he won fame and spent mostof his life. For a short time he had served Louis XIII and Richelieu. Poussin’sLes Bergers d’Arcadie came into the possession of Louis XIV after his agents hadbeen trying, with great tenacity, to lay their hands on it for some time, yetwhen the king finally obtained it, he kept it locked away in his privatechambers; rumour has it that he was afraid that it might reveal some secret ifit was displayed more publicly. The painting itself seems to offer no clues asto why the king wanted it so badly, or why he subsequently kept it from the eyesof the world.What we do know, however, is that in 1656 the king’s finance minister, NicolasFouquet, sent his own younger brother Louis to Rome to see Poussin, and thatLouis then wrote to Fouquet:He and I have planned certain things of which in a little while I shall be ableto inform you fully; things which will give you, through M. Poussin, advantageswhich kings would have great difficulty in obtaining from him, and which,according to what he says, no one in the world will ever retrieve in centuriesto come; and furthermore, it would be achieved without much expense and couldeven turn to profit, and they are matters so difficult to enquire into thatnothing on earth at the present time could bring a greater fortune nor perhapsever its equal…9What can he have been talking about? ‘Nothing on earth could ever bring agreater fortune’ sounds like a treasure, except that he also says it could ‘eventurn to profit’, which suggests that he means something else after all. What iscertain is that the king, who was only five years old when he came to thethrone, nursed an increasing dislike of his brilliant and ambitious financeminister. Fouquet became immensely wealthy and, according to his assistantColbert, managed this by cooking the books every afternoon. In 1661, Louis hadhim arrested, and he was eventually imprisoned. (Some historians have suggestedthat he was the famous Man in the Iron Mask, but he died twenty-three yearsbefore the mysterious prisoner.)Is it possible that when Fouquet sent his brother Louis to see Poussin it waswith treasonous intent?The Merovingian king Dagobert II, born in AD 651, was kidnapped as a child andtaken to Ireland, while a usurping major-domo took his place. He returned toFrance – in fact, to Rennes-le-Château – married to a Visigoth princess namedGiselle, and reclaimed the throne, but was murdered in 679 as he lay asleepunder a tree. The Church certainly played some part in the assassination, buthis major-domo, Pepin the Fat, was also involved. Pepin was the grandfather ofthe famous warrior Charles Martel, who turned back the Moslem invasion of Franceat the Battle of Poitiers. Martel’s son, Pepin the Short, seized the throne andinaugurated the Carolingian dynasty, fathering its most famous member, the greatCharlemagne.The descendants of Dagobert were understandably resentful about being deprivedof the throne, and there was always a movement in favour of their restoration,rather like that of the Jacobites in England. Similar to the Jacobites, theywere a lost cause, but one Merovingian descendant achieved a fame that rivalledthat of Charles Martel or Charlemagne. He was Godfrey de Bouillon (1058–1100),Duke of Lorraine, the man who led the First Crusade and recaptured Jerusalem –the knight who became the first King of Jerusalem.There can also be little doubt that he was the founder – or one of the founders– of another dynasty, the Priory of Sion, or, as it was first known, the ‘Orderof Our Lady of Sion’. Sion is another name for Jerusalem, and soon after thecapture of Jerusalem an Abbey of Sion was built on the Temple Mount and itsoccupants were known as the Order of Our Lady of Sion. According to the SecretDossier, the Order was founded in 1090, nine years before the fall of Jerusalem.Five of the nine original Templars were members. It seems probable that theTemplar order sprang out of the Order of Sion.Lincoln cites evidence to show that the two orders soon grew apart. It seemsthat the fabulous power and wealth of the Templars made them headstrong, ‘likeunruly children’. Matters came to a head in 1187, when a Templar named Gerard deRidefort led the knights into a rash encounter with the Saracens and lostJerusalem – this time forever. At this point, it seems, the Order of Sion lostpatience with the Templars, and broke with them. The Order now changed its nameto the Priory of Sion. One of the major aims of the Priory was the restorationof the Merovingians to the throne of France. When the Templars were destroyed in1307, the Priory continued to exist, no doubt because it was such a well-keptsecret.This could well explain why Louis XIV was anxious to get rid of Fouquet and toacquire Poussin’s painting. If the ‘secret that kings could not draw from him’was the secret of the Priory of Sion, Louis may well have been worried. Hisuncle, Gaston d’Orléans, had been married to the Duke of Lorraine’s sister, andthere was an attempt to depose Gaston’s elder brother, Louis XIII, in favour ofGaston, which would have meant that Merovingian blood would once again haveflowed in the veins of the kings of France.The attempt failed. But since Louis XIII was childless, it looked very much asif Gaston would nevertheless inherit the throne. Then, to everyone’s amazement,Louis XIII produced a son – at least his wife, Anne of Austria, did. Many peoplebelieved that Cardinal Richelieu was the true father, or perhaps that heemployed a ‘stud’, who some suggest was Richelieu’s captain of musketeers,François Dauger, thus frustrating the designs of the Merovingians and the Prioryof Sion.François Dauger had two sons, called Louis and Eustache, and many peoplecommented on their resemblance to Louis XIV, which would be understandable if,in fact, they were his half-brothers. Eustache was a ne’er-do-well, always introuble. Both Louis and Eustache were eventually arrested, Louis for an affairof the heart, Eustache for general hellraising, but Louis was released andcontinued to rise in the world. Eustache disappeared, and may well have been theMan in the Iron Mask. (It was actually a velvet mask, and if indeed Eustache wasthe mystery prisoner, he may have been forced to wear it because of hisresemblance to the king.) His offence may have been an attempt to blackmail theking– ‘Release my brother or else…’ – or he may have got involved with thePriory of Sion and the Merovingians, who would have been delighted to learn thatLouis XIV had no right to be on the throne.The Habsburgs were also members of the House of Lorraine, and therefore primecandidates for membership of the Priory of Sion, which sheds further light onthe facts that one of Saunière’s guests was Johann von Habsburg and thatSaunière received money from Austria. It sounds as if his visit to St Sulpiceintroduced him to people who were willing to share their secret and give himgenerous financial support as the present incumbent of Dagobert’s ancientstronghold…This complex and fascinating story has another twist. Lincoln learned from theretired clergyman that the ‘real treasure’ was the knowledge that Jesus did notdie on the cross, and this knowledge came from St Sulpice. If St Sulpice was theParis headquarters of the Priory of Sion, then it may well be that Saunière’ssecret – the secret that shocked the priest who attended his deathbed – was thatJesus had not died on the cross, and therefore the Christian Church had beenbuilt on foundations of sand, since it was based on the notion that Jesus diedto save man from the burden of original sin.When Lincoln was working on the BBC programme The Shadow of the Templars, he wassuddenly struck by a startling thought. He and two researchers, Richard Leighand Michael Baigent, were joking about a legend that the mother of King Merovec,the founder of the Merovingian line, had been impregnated by a sea creature, andone of them joked that the story sounded ‘fishy’. Suddenly Lincoln and Leighlooked at one another as they were seized with the same suspicion. Fish – thesymbol of Christianity. Could the legend mean that the lady had been impregnatedby… a symbol of Christianity, a direct descendant of Jesus?The Merovingian kings claimed that they reigned ‘by right of blood’ – royalblood – not by being anointed by the Church. Was the bloodline that they were soproud of that of Jesus himself? In which case, who was Jesus’s wife? In thevillage of Les Saintes Maries de la Mer, a yearly ceremony celebrates thearrival of Mary Magdalen in France, bearing the True Cross and the Holy Grail.The church in Rennes-le-Château is dedicated to her and has two statues of hercarrying the cross and the Grail. Saunière built a library called the TourMagdala – the Magdalen Tower. Mystics of the Middle Ages identified her with theplanet Venus – the goddess of love.Lincoln and Leigh were led to speculate that Jesus and Mary Magdalen had come toFrance and founded the bloodline of the Merovingians. Perhaps the tomb thatPoussin painted was, in fact, the tomb of Jesus? It was this extraordinaryspeculation – and Lincoln insists that it is merely a speculation – that madeThe Holy Blood and the Grail (1982)10 by Lincoln, Leigh and Baigent an instantbestseller.By now Lincoln had learned, through the detective work of a BBC researcher, thatthe most important living member of the Priory of Sion was a man called PierrePlantard. Plantard was indeed the name of a noble family of the Merovingianline. A meeting was arranged, and Lincoln invited Plantard to view the secondRennes-le-Château film, The Priest, the Painter and the Devil. He proved to be akindly and courteous gentleman – born in 1920 – and a group of his followerswere present. The closest seemed to be a marquis named Philip de Cherisey.Lincoln was to learn that de Cherisey was responsible for much of the SecretDossier deposited in the Louvre.Sitting behind them, Lincoln was pleased to observe that they became suddenlyattentive when the film showed an image of one of the parchments, in whichLincoln had detected the form of a pentagram, a figure made by joining thepoints of a five-pointed star.The pentagram is, of course, one of the most ancient magical symbols. I was onceadvised to draw one (mentally) on my gatepost if I wanted to deter unwelcomevisitors – it had to be upside-down. Upright it is supposed to keep evil at bay;upside-down (like a man standing on his head) it is supposed to attract sinisterforces.What is its origin? No one is sure, although it played an important part in thegeometry of Pythagoras. One of the most convincing explanations involves theplanet Venus. If we imagine the earth as the centre of the solar system (as theancients believed), it becomes obvious that there will be moments when everyplanet will be ‘eclipsed’ by the sun as it comes between the planet and theearth. Mercury, for example, is ‘eclipsed’ three times a year, and if we drawlines between these three points in the heavens they form an irregular triangle.Mars is ‘eclipsed’ four times, and the figure is an irregular rectangle. Infact, all the planets make irregular figures, except Venus, which makes aregular pentacle. If, as we have argued in this book, the ancients were studyingthe heavens much earlier than anyone supposed, it seems probable that Venus wasassociated with the pentagram at a very early date.11In addition to the hidden pentagram (which was not a regular one) in one of theparchments, Lincoln also noticed something odd about the geometry of Poussin’sLes Bergers d’Arcadie. Looking for the ‘secret’ that seems to have alarmed LouisXIV, he noticed that the staff of the shepherd on the right is neatly cut in twoby the shepherd’s arm, and the distance from the top of the staff to theshepherd’s pointed finger is precisely this same ‘half measure’. He soon noticedother ‘half measures’ throughout the painting. The picture had obviously beendesigned geometrically. He showed the painting to Professor ChristopherCornford, of the Royal College of Art, who found something even morefascinating.When Cornford reported to Henry Lincoln on Les Bergers d’Arcadie, he explainedthat he began by looking for one of two ‘systems’ in constant use by classicalpainters. One is a number system, based on Plato’s Timaeus (a dialogue about thecreation of the universe), which became highly influential in the Renaissance.The other is a far older system, a geometry based on the Golden Section.Cornford expected to find the Timaeus system in Poussin’s painting, because theGolden Section system was then regarded as extremely old-fashioned, and in facthe did find traces of it. But the basic system used in Les Bergers dArcadie isthe Golden Section. The painting is also full of pentagonal geometry.Consider the following pentagram drawn in a circle:[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_020_r1.jpg]A pentagram is the quintessential golden section geometric figure. In thediagram EF is a phi ratio of EB, and CF is a phi ratio of CA.When Cornford looked more closely, he could draw a pentagram that went outsidethe painting[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_021_r1.jpg]In short, the pentacle was encoded into Poussin’s painting.That led Cornford to make an interesting suggestion. Could the phrase ‘Poussinholds the key…’ be anything to do with the landscape around Rennes-le-Château,which is where Saunière searched for the treasure? This led Lincoln to one ofhis most important discoveries. When he looked at a map of the Rennes-le-Châteauregion, one thing was immediately obvious: three of its key sites —Rennes-le-Château, the Templar château of Bezu and the Blanchefort château —were three points of a triangle. And all were on hilltops.When Lincoln drew the triangle on his map, and proceeded to measure its lines,he received a surprise. It was a precise isosceles triangle, that is, with twosides exactly equal. With Bezu at the apex of the triangle, the lines from Bezuto Blanchefort and from Bezu to Rennes-le-Château were equal.This could not have been an accident. At some point in time, it seemed thatsomeone had observed that the three hilltops made a precise triangle and, in duecourse, they had been chosen as part of a secret pattern.Lincoln found himself wondering if, by any remote chance, there were two morehilltops that would form the rest of a pentagram. Of course, he felt, that wouldbe asking too much… yet when he studied the map, he was staggered to find thatthere were two such hilltops, in precisely the right places. The eastern one wascalled La Soulane, and the western one Serre de Lauzet. When the five hilltopswere joined up, they formed an exact pentacle.There was one more surprise to come. When Lincoln looked for the centre of themap, he found that it was marked by another hill, called La Pique. Although itssummit looked on the map like the dead centre, it was actually 250 yards to thesouth-east of centre, but that was to be expected – after all, this was not aman-made landscape.So this was the basic secret of Rennes-la-Château: that it was part of a sacredlandscape. Perhaps this is why Rennes-le-Château was chosen by Dagobert as hishome and why his son Sigisbert fled there after his father’s murder. The royalblood of the Merovingians was associated with a magic landscape.Rand had first become intrigued by Rennes after reading The Holy Blood and theHoly Grail. It states that a few miles east of Rennes-le-Château lie the ruinsof the Château of Blanchefort, ancestral home of Bertrand de Blanchefort, fourthGrand Master of the Knights Templar, who presided over the order in themid-twelfth century.It seems that Blanchefort ‘commissioned certain mysterious excavations’ in themountain where his château stood, all under conditions of the greatest secrecy.In 1156 a contingent of German miners arrived to work the mountain, apparentlyfor gold, but there couldn’t possibly have been any gold left in the mountain ofBlanchefort, as the Romans had exhausted the mines centuries earlier.12 And theywere ‘forbidden to fraternise in any way with the local population and were keptstrictly segregated from the surrounding community’. Lincoln hints thatsomething else in the area had attracted the GrandMaster. Rand naturally wondered if it might have anything to do with hisblueprint of sacred sites.He wrote: I agree with Lincoln’s conclusion that the complexity ofRennes-le-Château is evidence that “… the ancient surveyors… have left us theempirical reality of their amazing labours. They have left us the evidence oftheir skills and knowledge which, through many long centuries, has been lost andforgotten.”13 This dovetails with everything we’ve discovered about the AtlantisBlueprint.’Lincoln also notes the importance of the Golden Section in the whole Rennescomplex and links it to the planet Venus. He argues that the reason Venus is sowidely worshipped in world mythology is because its orbit appears pentagonal tous on earth. The pentagon is the geometric figure that most conclusivelyregisters the Golden Section. 100,000 years ago, during the Yukon Pole, Renneswas located at a Golden Section division of a line drawn from pole to pole.It was not alone. Nanking, China, also fits this pattern exactly. The surprisingfact is that both linkages occur only during the Yukon Pole. Nor is this theonly connection between ancient Celts and China. In Uriel’s Machine, Lomas andKnight examine the research of archaeologist Dr Elizabeth Wayland Barber, whosebook The Mummies of Urumchi is a study of the mummified remains of severalCaucasians found in the Chinese region of Xinjiang. Barber discovered plaidmaterial with the mummies. She wrote: ‘Not only does this woollen plaid looklike Scottish tartans but it also has the same weight, feel and initialthickness as a kilt cloth.’14Lomas and Knight comment:Barber acknowledges that two unrelated people could come up with the same twillweave, plaids and tartans, but when she considered all the factors which hadcoincided, she was quite firm in her conclusion: It rules out coincidence. Itseems certain, then, that these people had a direct connection with thepopulation of the British Isles who also wove plaid and tartans, the people wenow call the Celts.15In The New View Over Atlantis, John Michell also makes the connection betweenthe ancient Celts and China:In China until recently, as long ago in Britain, every building, every stone andwood, was placed in the landscape in accordance with a magic system by which thelaws of mathematics and music were expressed in the geometry of the earth’ssurface. The striking beauty and harmony of every part of China, which alltravellers have remarked, was not produced by chance. Every feature wascontrived. Where nature had placed two hills in discord, Chinese geomancers hadthe shape of one altered.16The fact that Rennes-le-Château and Nanking are both located at a Golden Sectiondivision of the pole-to-pole distance is further support that either the Celtsand Chinese shared knowledge, or, more likely, that their separate traditionsare derived from a common source.My own favourite story about Rand’s researches concerns a pyramid, not in Egyptor Mexico, but in China.In the summer of 1997, Rand was thinking about the Hudson Bay Pole and theorientation of Mexican religious sites to it. At this time, he heard from LauraLee, friend and radio interviewer whose Seattle-based show is broadcastinternationally, that the German writer Hartwig Hausdorf was going to appear onher programme to talk about ancient pyramids in China. Rand had no idea thatthere were pyramids in China.Hausdorf, the author of The Chinese Roswell, had been influenced by Erich vonDäniken’s ‘ancient astronaut’ theory, and had travelled in China, Tibet andMongolia searching for evidence of aliens visiting earth in the remote past.Hausdorf explained on the radio programme how, in the spring of 1945, anAmerican air force pilot named James Gaussman was returning from Chungking whenengine trouble forced him to a low altitude near Xian, in Shansi province.Directly below him he saw a white pyramid of ‘colossal size’. He took somephotographs, although these would not be published for another forty-five years.Two years later, in 1947, a pilot named Maurice Sheahan caught a glimpse ofanother enormous pyramid when he was flying over Shansi province, and again tookpictures. Although these were published in the New York Times and othernewspapers in March 1947, Chinese archaeologists denied that China had anypyramids.17In 1962, a New Zealand airline pilot named Bruce Cathie was also informed by theChinese that there were no pyramids in China. He was nevertheless able toconfirm the existence of several of them, and in a book called The Bridge ofInfinity18 suggested that there are a network of pyramids over the surface ofthe earth whose purpose is connected with ley lines and earth energies. (Hisviews have something in common with those of Christopher Dunn.)In March 1994, Hausdorf succeeded in getting permission to visit Xian, a formerimperial capital that is regarded as the cradle of Chinese civilisation.(Emperor Qin Shihuang, who built the Great Wall, has a tomb there, surrounded by10,000 life-size terracotta soldiers.) He saw a number of pyramids on the plain,but they were not 1,000 feet high, as Gaussman had reported, only about 200 feethigh, less than half the height of the Great Pyramid. They were flat-topped, andmade of clay baked to the consistency of stone. Trees and other vegetation hadbeen planted on them. Hausdorf realised that he was standing in a kind of craterat the top, suggesting that a chamber had collapsed.On two subsequent visits, Hausdorf examined sixteen pyramids, and he claims tohave counted a hundred. Professor Wang Zhijun, director of the Banpo Museum, whodiscussed[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_022_r1.jpg]The so-called ‘White Pyramid’ of China is located at a Golden Section divisionof the North Pole and equator distance.them with him, seemed to feel that they might be part of a sacred system of fengshui lines, a Chinese variation of leys. The professor estimated that they datedfrom about 2,500 BC – the time of the pyramids of Giza. Hausdorf was unable tovisit the White Pyramid of Xian himself, and admitted that he was not sure ofits existence.Rand was investigating phi sites when he heard about the White Pyramid. He foundthe city of Xian, in Shansi province, in his Times Atlas, but had no idea howfar away the White Pyramid might be. As a speculation, he wondered if it mightbe a phi distance from the pole, and worked out that this should be 3,337.2nautical miles, which would be 34 degrees, 23 minutes north.A few days later, he rang Shawn Montgomery in Toronto to talk about his latestinvestigations. He mentioned the White Pyramid, and his difficulty finding itsprecise coordinates.‘Oh, I have that,’ said Shawn. ‘It’s in Bruce Cathie’s book. I’ll get it foryou.’ And moments later, he was back with the location: 34 degrees, 26 minutesnorth – only 3 minutes (or 3 nautical miles) from Rand’s location.It seemed that Cathie had succeeded in getting his hands on some satellitephotographs of the pyramids. What was even more exciting was that there was, infact, another pyramid on the exact spot that Rand had calculated – 34 degrees,23 minutes north. He points out that the Lebanese village of Ehdin, where theO’Briens located Kharsag, is also at this latitude and is 5 degrees east ofGiza.So again Rand’s blueprint method pinpointed a sacred site.But what was its location with regard to the old North Pole in Hudson Bay? Randplugged the numbers into the ‘How Far Is It?’ site on the Web, and waited withhis fingers crossed. When the answer appeared on the screen, he gave a chortleof delight. During the Hudson Bay Pole, the White Pyramid was at 5 degreesnorth, precisely the same latitude as Byblos, a city sacred to both theEgyptians and the Phoenicians.Rand’s email describing his find ended: ‘It seems to me that the very positionof the Chinese pyramids suggests an advanced knowledge of the earth’sdimensions, coupled with an ability to determine these distances within verysmall margins of error.’What is even more significant is that people in China had possessed thisknowledge of the surface of the globe at a time when, according to historians,it was completely isolated from the rest of the world.Rand told me his reason for searching for Golden Section sites:The Golden Section is something that is consistent anywhere in the universe nomatter what the number system (base 10, 12, 60 etc.). If an advancedcivilisation was trying to make contact with future peoples they could never besure that their weights and measures would be exactly the same as the ones thatevolved long after they had perished.Two things, however, would never change: the dimensions of the earth and thegeometry of the Golden Section. The distance from the equator to the pole willalways be the same no matter what number system you use and you will always beable to divide this distance by the Golden Section.The geometry of Rennes-le-Château is, as we have seen, pentagonal, andpentagonal geometry is, as Lincoln points out, linked with phi, the GoldenSection. Did this mean that the Rennes-le-Château site was 100,000 years old?Almost certainly not, since its pentagonal geometry is natural, not man-made.But Rand’s blueprint theory suggests that Enoch’s ‘angels’ (i.e., geologists),making their survey at the time of the Hudson Bay Pole, recognised thatRennes-le-Château was one of the most unusual sites in the world, not onlybecause its geometry was pentagonal, reflecting the Golden Section, but alsobecause it had been at a Golden Section site at the time of the Yukon Pole. Itwould certainly have deserved one of their ‘markers’, upon which latergenerations would build their sacred sites.Other sacred sites match this pattern. Abydos, the ‘birthplace of Osiris’,Cuzco, in the Andes, and Nippur, the holiest Sumerian city, were all located atthe equator during the Yukon Pole but must have been constructed only a fewthousand years ago. Rennes-le-Château is in good company, but differs in onecritical respect: being centred on a natural pen-tacle, it would inevitably beregarded as sacred.This, then, was Rand’s reason for including Rennes-le-Château in the blueprint;Lincoln’s Key to the Sacred Pattern confirmed that it is one of the mostremarkable sites in our book, a natural ‘magic landscape’.Oddly enough, M. Plantard refused to confirm Lincoln’s insight. Although it wasobvious that he and Cherisey were startled that Lincoln had discovered thepentagonal geometry in the Saunière parchments, Plantard would simply notenlarge. On the contrary, when Lincoln asked him about the hidden codes,Plantard made the incredible remark that the parchments were ‘confections’concocted by his friend Cherisey for a ten-minute television film made someyears previously19 Quite rightly, Lincoln refused to swallow this. Theincredible complexity of the code left no doubt that it had taken a very longtime and a great deal of skill to prepare.There seems little doubt that it was the original aim of Plantard – and the‘Priory’ – to bring this mystery to public attention. De Sède originally toldLincoln: ‘We hoped it might interest someone like you.’20 Yet now Lincoln hadgot his teeth into the subject, and had discovered the pentagonal geometry,Plantard seemed to feel he had been too successful and wanted to backtrack.If so, he must have been delighted with the reaction to Andrews andSchellenberger’s book The Tomb of God. The thesis of that book was that the realsecret of Rennes-le-Château was the location of the tomb of Jesus, at the footof a mountain called Pech Cardou, 3 miles east of Rennes-le-Château. The BBCprogramme about the book was, to put it mildly, somewhat sceptical, and took theview that Plantard was an impostor, and that the whole Rennes-le-Château mysterywas a hoax – a major change of viewpoint since Lincoln’s original programmes.After I had watched the merciless debunking on television, I commented to mywife: ‘Well, that looks like the end of the Rennes-le-Château mystery’ But onreflection, I saw that this is not so. The programme might have shown – or setout to show – that the Priory of Sion was a recent invention, that theparchments were probably forgeries of de Cherisey, and that Plantard wasprobably an impostor, but that still left the mystery untouched. How hadSaunière become rich overnight? What had he discovered in the Visigothic pillar?The more I thought of it, the more I saw that the essence of the mysteryremained, whether M. Plantard was an impostor or not.But was he an impostor? Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince laid out the case againsthim in The Templar Revelation. He came to prominence in occupied Paris in 1942,as the Grand Master of a quasi-Masonic order called the Order Alpha-Galates,which was ‘markedly uncritical’ of the Nazis – in fact, the Nazis seemed toapprove of it. But then, they would have; part of Himmler’s job was to establishthat the Germans had a noble origin in the remote days of the Norse sagas and tocreate a modern mystical order with its roots in the Aryan past. PierrePlantard, whom Picknett and Prince describe as ‘a one-time draughtsman for astove-fitting firm, who allegedly had difficulty paying the rent from time totime’, then changed his name to Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair. He played animportant part in bringing about the return to power of General de Gaulle in1958. In 1956, the Priory of Sion had begun depositing ‘enigmatic documents’ inthe Bibliothèque Nationale. The implication was that these documents had beenconcocted as part of the ‘hoax’.In writing this chapter, I have reread Lincoln’s four books – The Holy Blood andthe Holy Grail, The Messianic Legacy (both with Leigh and Baigent), The HolyPlace and Key to the Sacred Pattern – have studied again his televisionprogrammes on Saunière and the Priory, and reread such books as Picknett andPrince’s The Templar Relevation, David Wood’s Genisis21 and Lionel and PatriciaFanthorpe’s The Holy Grail Revealed.22 And I can see no reason whatever forbelieving that the Priory of Sion is some kind of hoax, or that Pierre Plantardis not exactly who he says he is.Lincoln himself certainly felt doubts; he describes, in The Messianic Legacy,23,how he and his co-authors went along to see Plantard in Paris with the specificintention of confronting him with some major contradictions, including twoapparently discrepant birth certificates, one of which named him as ‘Plantard’and the other as ‘Plantard de Saint-Clair’. Plantard, far from beingembarrassed, answered each point with precise explanations: the birthcertificate that gave his name simply as Plantard and also the profession of hisfather as a ‘valet de chambre’ was explained as the substitution of falsifiedinformation to deceive the Gestapo, which was common during the war. WhenLincoln and his friends went to the Mairie to confront officials with thisexplanation, they readily agreed with Plantard.Lincoln — and I in turn — concluded that Plantard really was Plantard deSaint-Clair, and that there is every probability that the story of the Priory ofSion is true, from its inception in 1090 to Jean Cocteau and Plantard. (In TheShadow of the Templars, Lincoln filmed inside the church of Nôtre Dame deFrance, near Leicester Square in London, which has a mural of the crucifixion byCocteau, pointing out the irrelevant rose at the foot of the cross — symbol ofthe Templars — and other evidence that Cocteau was indeed a member of the Prioryof Sion.)Lincoln himself writes an introduction to one of the oddest, but mostinteresting, books about Rennes-le-Château, Genisis, by David Wood, who had madeanother curious discovery in the area: five churches (includingRennes-le-Château) fell on an exact circle. Wood found that these were connectedby a pentacle geometry. Lincoln writes (in Key to the Sacred Pattern): ‘It wasnow clear that my discovery of the Pentacle of Mountains was but the firstglimpse of something much more complex. Here was proof that there had been aconscious and highly skilled geometric plan…’ Oddly enough, Wood ignored thepentacle of mountains discovered by Lincoln.Wood’s book — and its sequel Geneset24 — are certainly impressive and ingenious,but his solution of the ‘mystery’ has more in common with Zechariah Sitchin thanwith Lincoln’s painfully precise investigations. He finds a number code thatpoints to the gods of ancient Egypt, and in a ‘fairy story’ printed as anepilogue to Genisis outlines his conclusions: 200,000 years ago, a super-racefrom the Sirius system came to our solar system in three huge space ships andcolonised Mars. This super-race was called — the Elohim.Since water was scarce on Mars, they used earth as their ‘farm’, although itsgravity was too high for their comfort. They created humanoid beings called Set,Osiris, Isis and Nephtys and an undersized ‘runt’ called Horus, and also a lessintelligent type of creature called ‘Watchers’. The base they made on earth wasan island called Atlantis. They also created two subordinate (and even lessintelligent) species called the Cains and the Seths, and cloned animals fortheir food. The supervisors – Osiris, Isis, etc. – were naturally regarded bythese subordinates as gods.Against the specific instructions of the Elohim, Isis created more of thesesubordinate creatures to reduce the workload of the Seths and Cains, and theexperiment soon got out of hand. The Nephilim, who had been chosen to do thework of impregnating the female ‘apes’, found that they so enjoyed it that theybegan to do it on the sly, producing hideous malformed hybrids. At this point,the Elohim decided to wipe out most of the population of the earth with a comet,which caused havoc and destroyed Atlantis. Finally, with the help of theEgyptian ‘gods’, the survivors created the beginnings of the civilisation weknow today…Understandably, Lincoln wanted nothing to do with this speculative mythology,and decided not to endorse it, yet he had no doubt that some of Wood’sgeometrical discoveries were valid. Moreover, he was fascinated by Wood’sdiscovery that the English mile, not the kilometre (as one would expect), hadbeen used as the unit of measurement by whoever originally designed the giganticpentagram connecting the French churches. When he checked this against his owngeometry, he discovered that Wood seemed to be correct.In 1991, Lincoln had been contacted by a Danish television producer who had beenborn on the island of Bornholm. Erling Haagensen had become fascinated byBornholm’s fifteen churches, which dated from the thirteenth century (the timeof the Knights Templar); they often seemed to be associated with ancientmegaliths – in fact, some megaliths were actually built into the church walls.Lincoln had been toying with the idea that perhaps some of the Rennes-le-Châteaupattern had been laid out in megalithic times, and when Haagensen told him thatthe geometry he had identified on Bornholm was pentacular, Lincoln becameconvinced that they were each ‘uncovering a different portion of the samemystery’.Moreover, Haagensen had found the English mile present in the Bornholm geometry.For example, if Haagensen’s geometry was correct, the distance between two ofthe churches, Ibsker and Povlsker, should be exactly 7 miles. And it was.Why the mile? In a chapter called ‘The Measure’, Lincoln lays out some curiousbut highly convincing facts. The French metre, which came into use in 1791, wasone-10,000,000th of the distance from the North Pole to the equator. Lincolnshows that an old English measure called the rod, pole or perch (which isone-320th of a mile) is also, in a more primitive version which Lincoln callsthe Cromlech Pole (198.41874 inches) a precise measure of the earth’s surface: 1Cromlech Pole multiplied by itself (i.e., squared) is 1 kilometre (39,370inches), When this ancient pole (198 inches) is multiplied by 1.618, phi, usingthe Golden Section, the result is 320, the number of poles in 1 mile. So thereis a mathematical connection between the British pole and the kilometre, andbetween the pole, multiplied by phi, and the mile.Rand had emphasised again and again that the Golden Section is one of the mostimportant keys to his geometry of sacred sites. He notes: ‘I found that one ofthe Bornhold churches was 16:18 west of the Great Pyramid. This church (atVestermarie) is supposed to have been built on top of a megalithic monument.During the Yukon Pole it joined Avebury, Stonehenge, London and others atlatitude 30N.’If the blueprint theory is correct, Rennes-le-Château and the pyramids of Chinawere part of a worldwide web of religious sites. It also seems that whoeverarranged the specific positioning of the sites was aware of the earlier crustmovements that preceded the Hudson Bay Pole.Rand was also intrigued by an underwater site off the most westerly point ofJapan. He writes:In 1987, a scuba-diving instructor named Kihachiro Aratake was exploring thesouthern waters off the island of Yonaguni when he encountered a sight that lefthim breathless. Beneath the waters of the island lay a structure that seemedman-made. The ramifications of this discovery, if true, would force us torewrite Asian prehistory. This is precisely what Professor Masaaki Kimura, amarine seismologist from the University of Ryukyus in Okinawa, believes must bedone. He took up the case of the Yonaguni ‘pyramid’ in 1990 and has been achampion of its authenticity ever since. Joining him, and enthusiasticallyendorsing his views, are Graham Hancock and Santha Faiia.25On the other side of the fence are those researchers such as John Anthony Westand Robert Schoch, who believe that the structure beneath the water is a freakof nature, a natural formation. Professor Kimura counters these arguments bypointing to a ‘wall’ at the western edge of the monument which containslimestone blocks that aren’t indigenous to the island.Although he continues to believe that this is a natural anomaly, Schoch notes:‘Yonaguni Island contains a number of old tombs whose exact age is uncertain,but that are clearly very old. Curiously, the architecture of those tombs ismuch like that of the monument.’26Rand’s blueprint makes him think that Yonaguni is a significant sacred sitebecause it was located at the all important 10 phi latitude during the YukonPole, thus joining, Nanking, Rennes-le-Château and Rosslyn Chapel at a goldensection division of the Yukon Pole.But, as we will see, the ‘blueprint’ shows that many sites can be aligned notonly to the Hudson Bay Pole but also to the much older Yukon Pole. This mightsuggest a tradition that extends back at least 100,000 years.Although Rand believes that, since modern humans have been around for more than100,000 years, the idea of a 100,000-year-old civilisation is a possibility, hethinks it far more possible that the links to the Yukon Pole were established byscientists using geological evidence before the flood, about 12,000 years ago.In other words, just as Charles Hapgood had used applied geology in the 1950s todetermine the position of earlier poles, so also might the Atlantean ‘surveyors’have discovered the former latitudes of the Yukon Pole and placed their baseswhere these intersected with the Hudson Bay Pole (which was ‘their’ poleimmediately before the flood).Henry Lincoln cites a remarkable book called Historical Metrology (1953)27 by amaster engineer named A.E. Berriman, an erudite volume covering ancient Egypt,Babylon, Sumer, China, India, Persia and many other cultures. It begins with thequestion ‘Was the earth measured in remote antiquity?’ and sets out todemonstrate that indeed it was. It argues that ancient weights and measures werederived from measuring the earth – which, of course, means in turn that ancientpeople had already measured the earth.The book must have struck Berriman’s contemporaries as hopelessly eccentric. Hesays that one measure was a fraction of the earth’s circumference, that ameasure of land area (the acre) was based on a decimal fraction of the square ofthe earth’s radius, and that certain weights were based on the density of waterand of gold. It sounds almost as if Berriman is positing the existence of someancient civilisation that vanished without a trace, except for these ancientmeasures.This, of course, is consistent with Hapgood’s comment that history does notnecessarily proceed steadily in a forward direction; it might pause, or evenbacktrack. This might also be the basis of his strange assertion about a sciencethat dates back 100,000 years.Henry Lincoln had established contact with a Norwegian, Harald Boehlke, who hadalso made some strange discoveries about Norwegian distances. Norway was paganuntil 1,000 years ago. With the coming of Christianity, scattered trading postsdisappeared and gave way to larger centres which became cities. Boehlke’sresearches seemed to establish that these new cities – Oslo, Trondheim, Bergen,Stavangar, Hamar, Tonsberg – were placed in what looked like quite arbitrarilychosen spots, for example, Oslo is in what was simply a backwater, while no onehas the slightest idea why Stavangar was chosen as a cathedral town. Butdistances seem chosen for some mathematical reason: Oslo to Stavangar, 190miles; Oslo to Bergen, 190 miles; Tonsberg to Stavangar, 170 miles; Tonsberg toHalsnoy, 170 miles; and so on. Moreover, the position of the old monasteriesagain shows a pentagonal geometry. It looks as if the Church was using somesecret geometrical knowledge in creating the new Christian Norway.Lincoln also identified a ‘church measure’ of 188 metres, and appealed in aFrench magazine for further examples of it, as well as of pentagonal geodesics.A mathematics teacher named Patricia Hawkins, who lived in France, was able tofind no fewer than 162 ‘church measures’ linking churches, hilltops and theroadside crucifixes called calvaries in the Quimper area of Brittany.Lincoln begins the last chapter of Key to the Sacred Pattern:We are confronting a mystery. The structured landscape of Rennes-le-Château andits association with the English mile (as well as the mile’s apparent link withthe dimensions of the Earth) are easily demonstrated, with a multitude ofconfirming instances. The measure and the geometry are evident. The patterns arerepeatable. The designs are meaningful. All this was created in a remote past,upon which the phenomenon is shedding a new light.28He pleads for historians and archaeologists to turn their attention to theevidence.By ‘patterns’, Lincoln is not simply talking about the pen-tacle of mountains orthe circle of churches. His own study of the Rennes-le-Château area revealedmany patterns that could only have been created by deliberate intent. The ‘holyplace’ of his title is ‘the natural pentagon of mountains, and the artificial,structured Temple that was built to enclose it.’I must admit that I only have to see a map covered with lines drawn all over itto groan and close the book, but Lincoln soon had me convinced. For example, hehas a diagram centred on the church at Rennes-le-Château, with lines drawn fromit to surrounding villages, churches and castles. Straight lines ran from somedistant church or château, straight through the church at Rennes-le-Château andout the other side to another château or church.[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_023_r1.jpg]One of his most convincing discoveries is of a grid pattern. When lines weredrawn connecting various sites, they were found to run parallel to one another –not only from left to right, but up and down. The lines were the same distanceapart:[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_024_r1.jpg]Moreover, the unit measure on this grid is the English mile – the point DavidWood had also made about the geometry of the area. (Lincoln prints lists ofdistances that are in miles: for example, Rennes-le-Château to Bezu, precisely 4miles; Rennes-le-Château to Soulane, precisely 4 miles.)He also made a discovery that may throw a new light on Saunière’s unexplainedfortune. Many of his alignments went through the tower Saunière had built as hislibrary, the Magdala Tower, which was placed as far to the west as Saunièrecould go – he built it on the edge of a sheer drop.Furthermore, not long before his death in 1917, Saunière had commissionedanother tower, 60 metres high. We do not know where it was to be located, butLincoln points out that one of the most important alignments of the area is the‘sunrise line’, which runs from Arques church, through Blanchefort, toRennes-le-Château. This line was the one that first got Lincoln looking forEnglish miles. It was almost 6 miles long.If it was to be exactly 6 miles long, it would end on the slope below theMagdala Tower, but since it is on a slope below the Tower it would have to behigher than the Tower if the landmarks – Blanchefort and Arques church – were tobe seen from its summit. Is this where Saunière meant to build his new tower? Ifso, it underlines the fact that the whole area has been deliberately laid outwith a geometrical logic that reminds one of the streets of New York.Soon after Saunière had discovered the parchments, he spent a great deal of timerambling around surrounding hillsides, claiming he was collecting stones tobuilt a grotto. Most commentators suspect that he was looking for treasure, butthere is now a more likely possibility: that on his trip to Paris he had learnedthe secret of the geometry of the ‘Temple’, and he was now familiarising himselfwith it. Then he built the Magdala Tower, completing the ‘sunrise’ alignment,going as far west as he could – the slope of the landscape frustrated him. Itseems highly probable that, twenty-five years later, he prepared to build asecond tower, 60 metres high, which would complete the ‘sunrise line’. It soundsas if Saunière’s discovery of the parchments led to his being appointedcustodian of the ‘Temple’, with the money that went with that role.What Lincoln has done, with his thirty-year investigation of Rennes-le-Château,is to demonstrate the existence of some ancient science of earth measurement.Since medieval times, this science seems to have been in the custody of theChurch (and we must naturally suspect the involvement of the Templars), butLincoln is inclined to believe that it may be far older – dating back to the ageof the megaliths. This immediately reminds us of Alexander Thom and his ‘StoneAge Einsteins’, while Rand’s evidence suggests that we may be looking at datesthousands of years before Stonehenge or Carnac.Berriman seems to be making the same point in Historical Metrology. His argumentthat prehistoric measurement was geodetic in origin – that is, was derived fromthe size of the earth – is powerfully expanded at the very beginning of Chapter1.He points out that although the Greeks did not know the size of the earth, theearth’s circumference happens to be precisely 216,000 Greek stade (the Greekstade is 600 Greek feet, and the Greek foot is 1.0125 times as long as theEnglish foot).If we want to find out how many Greek stades there are to one degree of theearth’s circumference, we divide 216,000 stade by the 360 degrees in a circle,and the answer, significantly, turns out to be 600 – the same as the number offeet in a stade.If we then divide by 60 – to get the number of stade in 1 minute of thecircumference – we get 10 stade. Change this to Greek feet – 6,000 – and divideagain by 60, to find the number of Greek feet in 1 second, and we see that it isprecisely 100.This simply cannot be chance. Distances do not normally work out in neat roundfigures. It is obvious that (a) the Greeks took their stade from someone else,and (b) that someone else knew the exact size of the earth. Berriman is full ofthese puzzling facts – for example, the area of the great bath of Mohenjo Daro,in the Indus Valley, is 100 square yards.Here is another curiosity: the Romans had a land measure called a jugerum, whichis five-eighths of an English acre (as the French metre is five-eighths of anEnglish mile) and exactly 100 square English ‘poles’. Again, we are faced withthe idea that ancient measures are not dependent on the whim of some ancientking’s land surveyor, but on a tradition stretching back into the dim past, andbased on an exact knowledge of the size of the earth.Lincoln has an amusing but fascinating speculation about this ‘Englishconnection’. Early in his investigation into Rennes-le-Château, he went to theBibliothèque Nationale with Gérard de Sède, who suggested he should request abook called Le Vraie Langue Celtique (The True Celtic Tongue)27 by the AbbéHenri Boudet, priest of nearby Rennes-le-Bains and a close friend of Saunière.In fact, there is strong evidence that Boudet was Saunière’s paymaster.Plantard’s grandfather visited Boudet in 1892, and Boudet not only passed onmore than 3.5 million gold francs to Saunière (or rather, to Saunière’shousekeeper, Marie Denardaud), but more than 7.5 million gold francs to BishopBillard, the man who appointed Saunière and who was obviously in on the secret.Since a gold franc was worth thirty-five modern francs and there are about ninefrancs to the pound sterling, Saunière received more than the equivalent of £13million (over $20 million) and his bishop more than twice that amount.Lincoln was able to obtain Boudet’s book, and found it baffling as well asfunny. Boudet seemed to think that the original language of mankind before theTower of Babel was English – or rather, Celtic. This part of Boudet’s bookLincoln describes as ‘linguistic tomfoolery’, and since Boudet was known to bean intelligent man Lincoln suspects he had his tongue in his cheek. But thevolume developed into something far more interesting as he went on to discussthe complex megalithic structures of the area. The subtitle of the book is TheCromlech of Reines-les-Bains – a cromlech is a megalith made up of a large flatstone resting on two upright stones, rather like a huge dining table.It looks as if Boudet’s job was simply to hint at the mystery of the whole area,and imply that it dated back to megalithic times, but Lincoln is also inclinedto suspect that his intention was also to tell his reader that one major key tothe secret of the area lies in English – perhaps in English measures, such asthe English mile. Was Boudet hinting that the original measures of mankind areEnglish – such as the mile?In summary, the Rennes-le-Château area certainly qualifies as one of Rand’ssacred sites. It differs from all the others in being centred on a naturalpentacle. Lincoln is certain that it has been sacred for at least 1,000 years,for the ‘temple’ – consisting of churches, castles and villages – must have beendesigned at least 1,000 years ago. (Rand, of course, believes it was recognisedas a sacred site during the Hudson Bay Pole.)That raises an obvious question. The pentacular structure of the mountains ofthe area can only be seen from the air or on a good map, but we know that therewere no good maps 1,000 years ago, except portolans, which covered the sea. Landmaps were crude in the extreme. We have also seen Hapgood’s evidence that therewere maps — even of Antarctica before the ice — that dated from thousands ofyears before Christianity.*It has been stated that this is the reason that Friday the 13th is an unluckyday, but there is no evidence for this - Friday was considered an unlucky day byChristians because Jesus was said to have been crucified on a Friday, while theunlucky number 13 was the number present at the Last Supper. but that wealthseems to have mysteriously disappeared. For example, the knights of Bezu (nearRennes-le-Château) avoided the trap and escaped with vast amounts of treasure.Could it be coincidence that the commander of these knights was called theSigneur de Gotte, and that he was related to the Pope, the former Bertrand deGotte? Or, moreover, that the Pope’s mother was a member of the Blanchefortfamily, who owned a château on the next hilltop to Bezu?"},{"pageContent":"9WHAT THE TEMPLARS FOUNDIN MAY 1996, I was in Edinburgh with my wife; we had been invited to lunch byGraham Hancock’s uncle, Jim Macaulay. In the bar of his golf club, he said, ‘I’dlike to take you to a special place this afternoon.’‘What is it?’‘It’s called Rosslyn Chapel. It was built by a Templar in the mid-fifteenthcentury.’ He reminded me that this date was more than a century after theTemplars had been arrested by Philip the Fair. ‘The French Templars werearrested in 1307. Many escaped to Scotland.’My wife Joy is the historian in our family, and she asked Jim what was specialabout the place.‘Well, there’s a sculpture of a corncob – about half a century before Columbusdiscovered America.’By the time we arrived at the chapel we were expecting something quite unusual.We were not disappointed. To begin with, the style of Rosslyn was impressivelyGothic. The ticket office was also a bookshop, and I bought a couple ofpamphlets about Rosslyn, including Robert Brydon’s The Guilds, the Masons andthe Rosy Cross.1 I noticed that they also had for sale a book called The HiramKey, by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas. I had heard about it already – infact, had been warned about it. My own book From Atlantis to the Sphinx was dueto be published that weekend, but Keeper of Genesis by Robert Bauval and GrahamHancock had already appeared, and I had been told that The Hiram Key, on arelated theme, was due out about the same time. Literary editors of newspapersmight decide to review all three in the same article, and so cut down the amountof space available to each, so I considered The Hiram Key as a potential rival.But that didn’t prevent me from buying a copy for Joy to read on the train.Rosslyn turned out to be a very strange place, and Jim Macaulay was an excellentguide. This Christian chapel seemed to be half pagan. To begin with, itsdecoration seemed to be devoted to various kinds of vegetation, a riot of carvedflowers and fruits, and, as Jim pointed out, the pagan figure known as the GreenMan seemed to be everywhere. In mythology he represents the rebirth ofvegetation every spring, and pagan festivals revolved around him. What was hedoing in a Christian church?In my book Mysteries,2 written twenty years earlier, I had discussed the ancientreligion of the moon goddess Diana, which had been driven out by Christianityyet had refused to die. An eccentric scholar named Margaret Murray had evensuggested that witchcraft was really a religion based on this ancient worship ofDiana, and that witch trials in which the Devil is described as having presidedover a Witches’ Sabbat were really pagan fertility rituals, presided over by ahigh priest dressed as the god Pan, with a goat’s feet and horns.I found myself wondering if William St Clair (or Sinclair, as it was spelledlater), the man who had built Rosslyn, was as pious a Christian as he wassupposed to be. There was obviously some mystery attached to the place. Therecould be no possible doubt about the representation of sweetcorn, or of theplant called aloes cactus, also a native of America, which looks rather like alily and has a bitter flavour.We left Rosslyn after a couple of hours, feeling oddly disturbed; there wasdefinitely something peculiar about the place. Jim dropped us off at the trainback to Glasgow, where I was lecturing that evening. On the journey, I began toread a book that Jim had lent me called Time Stands Still, by Keith Critchlow,3while Joy read The Hiram Key. I could see immediately why Jim had lent me thebook. In From Atlantis to the Sphinx, I speculated about a civilisation thatpredated the ‘Atlantis catastrophe’, and at the beginning of Time Stands StillCritchlow speaks about Alexander Thom’s investigations into ancient megalithsthen goes on to talk about certain Babylonian clay tablets that had beenconsigned to a dusty shelf in the Plimpton Library in New York. Labelled‘Commercial Tablets’, they had recently proved to contain some extremelyinteresting numbers: pairs of Pythagorean triplets, that is, numbers referringto Pythagorean triangles.The simplest Pythagorean triangle, where the square on the hypotenuse equals thesum of the square on the other two sides, has sides of 3, 4 and 5 units. Whensquared, these numbers turn into 9, 16 and 25 – and, of course, 9 plus 16 equals25. On these Babylonian tablets, only two of the three numbers were given. Butthese were enormous numbers, such as 12,709, 13,500 and 18,541. How did theBabylonians – or the Sumerians, who probably originated the numbers – manage tosquare numbers such as 18,541? Their number system was particularly crude, ascomplicated as Roman numerals. Critchlow concludes that ‘actual numbers conveyedsome sort of immediate perception of the general relationships existing betweenthese numbers’.4Some people – known as calculating prodigies – have this odd ability to doenormous sums in their heads. A five-year-old child named Benjamin Blyth, outwalking with his father one morning, asked him what time it was and his fathertold him, ‘Ten minutes to eight.’ A hundred yards later, Benjamin said, ‘In thatcase I have been alive…’ and named the number of seconds, about 158 million.Back at home, his father did the calculation on paper, and said, ‘No, you werewrong by 172,800 seconds.’ ‘No I wasn’t,’ said the child, ‘you’ve forgotten twoleap years.’5Many of these calculating prodigies are very young, and their powers disappearas they grow up (Benjamin Blyth became a perfectly normal — that is,non-prodigious — adult). We cannot imagine such odd powers, but they obviouslycome naturally. Is it possible that our Sumerian — or even remoter — ancestorscould somehow see these immense numbers in their heads as if they were in frontof their noses? The psychiatrist Oliver Sacks mentions two mentally subnormalcalculating twins in a New York psychiatric hospital, who saw a box of matchesfall off a table, and had counted them before they hit the floor. Could theancient people who created the Nineveh constant have been like that?The Hiram Key is equally fascinating, and nothing if not controversial. Itreinforced the suspicion in my mind that William St Clair may have been theguardian of some curious — and non-Christian — mystery.Robert Lomas and Christopher Knight are both Freemasons, and I knew little aboutFreemasonry. I knew that Masons are believed to have started in the guilds ofthe Middle Ages, such as the stonemasons who built Chartres. With so muchcathedral building going on, there was plenty of work for everybody, andstonemasons travelled from place to place, having a secret handshake by whichthey recognised one another.Masonry began to reach the general consciousness in the mid-seventeenth century,when it seems to have been involved with the strange affair of the Rosicrucians.This began in 1614 with the publication of a pamphlet called Fama Fraternitas(or ‘Fraternal Declaration’) of the Meritorious Order of the Rosy Cross. Thispurported to describe the life of a fifteenth-century mystic-magician calledChristian Rosenkreuz, who lived to be 106 and whose body was preserved –undecayed – in a mysterious tomb for the next 120 years. The pamphlet went on toinvite all interested parties to join the Brotherhood, and told them that theyonly had to make their interest known (by word of mouth or in writing) and theywould be ‘contacted’. Hundreds of people published their willingness to join,but, as far as is known, no one ever received a reply.The Fama was followed by two more ‘Rosicrucian’ works, the Confessio (1615), anda larger work called The Chemical Wedding (1616), which both increased theRosicrucian fever. The author is believed to have been a Protestant theologiannamed Johann Valentin Andrae, who is most certainly the author of The ChemicalWedding although he denied writing the other two. He seems to have started as anidealistic young man who hoped to launch a new spiritual movement, since – likeso many other people at that period – he felt that it was time for a newbeginning.It seems that in Scotland and in England an organisation that called itself theFreemasons came into being around 1640. The Catholic Church came to detest it,but in the early days – particularly in Scotland – there seemed to have been asmany Catholics as Protestants in the organisation. Freemasonry was basicallyabout the brotherhood of man. In War and Peace the hero, Peter Bezukhov, feelsspiritually and emotionally drained, until he meets a Freemason who renews hisfaith in life. The Mason tells him: ‘No one can attain to truth by himself. Onlyby laying stone on stone, with the cooperation of all, by the millions ofgenerations from our forefather Adam to our own times, is that temple rearedwhich will be a worthy dwelling place of the Great God.’ He goes on to explainthat the chief object of the order is the ‘handing down of a great mystery,which has come down from the remotest ages’. Peter becomes a Mason by goingthrough incredibly strange and complicated rituals that involve a symbolic deathand rebirth, and he ends up feeling completely refreshed, ‘as if he had comeback from a long journey’. Mozart, of course, underwent the same rituals, andput them into The Magic Flute.The implication of all this is that Freemasonry was a secret society whosepurpose was to produce in its members the sense of a great religious conversion.It can be seen that it involves a certain paradox. Andrae wrote the Rosicrucianpamphlets as a kind of ‘hoax’ (as he himself later put it), yet he also intendedto cause a spiritual revolution. Nietzsche said, ‘The great man is the playactor of his own ideals.’ Andrae hoped to create greatness by creating highideals. Nevertheless, a cynic might say that Freemasonry was the unintendedoutcome of a hoax.Knight and Lomas had a far more interesting and exciting view of Freemasonry.Modern Freemasons are inclined to believe that the curious ceremony ofinitiation – with a noose round the neck, a slipper on one foot and the othertrouser-leg rolled up to the knee – and the incomprehensible questions andanswers are pure invention. As Lomas and Knight studied the ceremonies involvedin the thirty-three degrees of Masonry, they increasingly began to feel that itsroots lie in the remote past – and not merely two or three centuries ago, but athousand years or more. As their research project progressed, they quicklyconcluded that Freemasonry can trace its origins at least to the KnightsTemplar, and that the most interesting mystery is precisely what those originalnine knights discovered below the Temple in Jerusalem.Although the Templars were on the surface an organisation created by a fewCrusaders in the hope of achieving power and influence, behind them lies astrong sense of particular knowledge, of possession of some secret tradition.Did Philip the Fair really destroy them simply because he wanted their wealth?Or did this motive happen to fit in with some other motive shared by the Church?Again, if the Church persecuted the Templars simply because Philip persuadedPope Clement V to help him seize their wealth, why did its hostility persist forso long? After all, Philip had been regarded as an enemy of the Church (whichexcommunicated him) and that feeling must have been strengthened by his laterdemand that its centre of power should be moved from Rome to Avignon. TheTemplars, in fact, had been servants of the Pope. After Philip’s death, youmight expect a back-swing of sympathy for them, so why did the Church genuinelyseem to detest them and to want to stamp them out like plague rats?Lomas and Knight set out to try and uncover the origin of Freemasonry and beganby rejecting the stonemason theory, on the grounds that there were nostonemasons’ guilds in England. They mention the interesting fact that Solomon’sTemple was not, as most of us naturally assume, some huge building covering manyacres, but smaller than Solomon’s harem, about the size of an ordinary church,say the size of Rosslyn Chapel. Turning their attention to the Templars, theyconclude – as we did in the last chapter – that Hugh de Payens and his knightsspent years excavating beneath the remains of the Temple, searching forsomething specific, something whose presence they suspected in advance.For what? Lomas and Knight believe the knights found a treasury of ancientscrolls that had been deposited there before the destruction of the Temple bythe Romans in AD 70. The scrolls were the scriptures and secret rituals of aJewish religious community called the Essenes. When the Jewish revolt againstthe Romans broke out in AD 66, their books were hidden away in the Temple and incaves by the Dead Sea. The latter were discovered by an Arab shepherd in 1947,who took them home with him, and fortunately decided against using them asfire-lighters. They became famous worldwide as the Dead Sea Scrolls.Lomas and Knight believe that the scrolls hidden in the Temple were even moreimportant. Lomas speculates: ‘They knew that they had found something of immensesignificance that was probably very holy, so they decided to get themtranslated… The man with the solution was Geoffrey de St Omer, the second incharge to Huges de Payen…’ Geoffrey took some of the scrolls back to an oldpriest called Lambert, now known as Lambert of St Omer. ‘Today, one of the mostfamous of all Lambert of St Omer’s works is his hasty copy of a drawing thatdepicts the Heavenly Jerusalem.’This drawing, made around 1120, shows the basic symbols of Freemasonry fivecenturies before Freemasonry is supposed to have been founded. Moreover, thesymbolism also leaves Lomas and Knight in no doubt that the drawing originatedin the Temple, and that it was one of the things found by the Templars.The notion of a Heavenly Jerusalem (or New Jerusalem), they point out, was foundin the Dead Sea Scrolls, based on Ezekiel’s vision. They conclude: ‘With thediscovery of the Heavenly Jerusalem Scroll… we were now certain that theTemplars did find the secrets of their Order inscribed upon the scrolls buriedby the Nasoreans (or Essenes of Qumran…)’Unlike Graham Hancock, Lomas and Knight do not suggest that the scrolls containthe secret of Gothic architecture, but they do argue that the tremendousexplosion of cathedral building all over Europe, and particularly in France (80cathedrals and 500 abbeys), was the direct result of that vision of the HeavenlyJerusalem the Templars brought back with them from the remains of Solomon’sTemple.Lomas and Knight researched Palestine in the time of Jesus, and theirconclusions make it clear why the Templars were later persecuted as heretics.Jesus was a member of the sect known as the Essenes, whose ‘lost scriptures’ weknow as the Dead Sea Scrolls. The original Essenes were orthodox Jews whodisagreed with the teachings of the priests in control of the Temple. In protestthey withdrew to Qumran where they lived strictly ascetic lives. Their leaderwas Jesus’s younger brother James, also known as the ‘Teacher of Righteousness.’Both Jesus and his cousin John the Baptist were regarded by the Essenes asmessiahs who were expected to lead the people in revolt against the Romans andestablish the Kingdom of God. After the death of John the Baptist, Jesus becamemore radical, and spent the period of his year of ministry gathering followers.Convinced that the time for action had finally come, and that God would supportthe revolt, Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an ass, fulfilling the prophecy ofZachariah that the king would arrive on a donkey. He caused a riot in the Templeby attacking the money-lenders, then withdrew to the nearby village of Bethanyto await the revolt that he believed would soon follow.But there was to be no uprising, at least not yet. The Romans arrested Jesus andhis brother James. Lomas and Knight believe that James was actually thecharacter known as Barabbas (which is not a proper name, but a title meaning‘son of the father’). James was released; Jesus was crucified.Afterwards, when the body of Jesus disappeared from his tomb, it gave rise tothe story that Jesus had risen from the dead. The Essenes believed that this wasa sign of the fulfilment of Jesus’s mission as the Messiah. So Christianity wasborn.The new religion was further transformed with the coming of Paul who, around AD60, had a vision on the road to Damascus, and as a result became the chiefexponent of a new kind of Christianity. It is important to note, Lomas andKnight point out, that this Damascus would not have been the Damascus in Syria,where Paul would have had no authority, but rather Qumran, which was also knownas Damascus.James and his followers must have been incredulous when their chief persecutorarrived at Qumran, declared himself a Christian, and began asking questionsabout James’s brother Jesus. But their relief would later turn to rage when theyheard the kind of ‘Christianity’ Paul was preaching – that Jesus had died on thecross as a scapegoat for the sins of mankind, and that anyone could become freeof original sin by acceptingJesus as the Son of God. The Qumran Christians began to refer to Paul as ‘thespouter of lies’.By a historical accident, it was Paul’s version of Christianity that survived.The reason for the triumph of Christianity was entirely political. In AD 66there was another Jewish revolt, prompted partly by the murder of James, who wasthrown from the top of the Temple by the priests. It was at that point, Lomasand Knight believe, that the Qumranians decided to hide their scriptures untilpeace was restored. The less important ones were hidden in the Dead Sea caves.The more important ones were hidden in the Temple, where the Templars would findthem eleven centuries later.The revolt failed. The Roman general Vespasian stamped it out with incrediblebrutality, also destroying most of the ‘Christians’. But by that time, Paul wasabroad, preaching his own version of Christianity to the gentiles. And this,ironically, was the version that went on to conquer the world.By AD 300 the Roman empire was falling to pieces, overstretched by its conquestsand its need for huge armies. The emperor Constantine had an inspiration. Aboutone in ten of his subjects were Christians. If he made Christianity the religionof the Roman empire, he would have a supporter in every town and village, and afellow emperor in every city large enough to have a bishop. (Constantine himselfnever became a Christian – he remained a worshipper of the sun god SolInvictus.)His solution worked, and Christianity held together the Roman empire for anothertwo centuries. But by now the Christian Church had taken over the reins ofpower. Lomas and Knight quote Pope Leo X, a contemporary of Henry VIII, assaying: ‘It has served us well, this myth of Christ’.And now we can see the possible religious reasons why the Church was so anxiousto destroy the Templars. They were the direct descendants of the JerusalemChurch of Qumran. They knew the truth about the original Christianity of theEssenes, how this had been hijacked by St Paul, and how this new version ofChristianity had become the religion of the Roman Empire.It is, perhaps, this horrible secret that was part of the deathbed confessionthat Beranger Saunière passed onto his priest. If so, then it is not surprisingthat the priest was so deeply shocked by what he heard.Rand believes that the sensational find beneath the Temple had little to do withJesus. He thinks that King Philip and his puppet, Pope Clement V, tried todestroy the Templars for strictly secular reasons. The King was jealous of theirpower and deeply in debt to the order. He used the charge of heresy as a ploy tocancel his debts and seize the Templar gold. He was not one to worry overtheological issues but rather a passionate egoist who only wanted to fan theflames of his own glory. Religion was simply a weapon he wielded like a club tostrike down those who did not bow before him.Rand believes the Templars discovered ancient maps beneath Solomon’s Templewhich they used to position their important bases at locations that mirror thegeography of the Yukon Pole. It seems that Rennes-le-Château is not the onlysite associated with the Templars and the pole of nearly 100,000 years ago. Randexplains that it wasn’t until 1127, after the original members of the order hadreturned to France, that Hugh de Payens began his search for new recruits for anew order. In January 1128, he acquired official recognition for the TemplarOrder from the Church and he became the first Grand Master. That same year dePayens visited Henry I of England, and was given a royal welcome. The followingyear, 1129, the first Templar site in England was founded in London on the siteof what is now Holborn Underground station.6When Rand compared London’s co-ordinates to the Yukon Pole he discovered that itwas within half a degree of 30 degrees north during the Yukon Pole. This is, ofcourse, the latitude of the Great Pyramid today. And London wasn’t the onlyBritish sacred site associated with the Templars to share this latitude. Amongthem were Glastonbury, Stonehenge, Bath, Avebury, Old Sarum and Tintagel.7Tintagel is, of course, associated with King Arthur, his Knights of the RoundTable and the quest for the Holy Grail. Rand noted that it is 36 degrees west ofthe Great Pyramid, one tenth of the distance around the globe. During the YukonPole, Tintagel was located at 29 degrees, 59 minutes north, precisely thelatitude of the Great Pyramid today.Moving east from Tintagel we encounter Glastonbury. John Michell writes:‘Glastonbury has been described as Britain’s only true national shrine, theomphalos or Temple of Britain and the English Jerusalem.’8 Like Tintagel,Glastonbury was located at 30 degrees north during the Yukon Pole.Avebury and Stonehenge are so close to each other that for the purpose of theblueprint they, along with Old Sarum, constitute a single cluster of sacredsites at 30 degrees north during the Yukon Pole. Avebury, like Tintagel, waslocated at 29 degrees, 59 minutes north, suggesting an ancient link between thetwo sites. Nigel Pennick notes: ‘Several researchers, including Keith Critchlowand John Michell, have drawn attention to another curious coincidence atStonehenge. According to their calculations, the underlying geometry anddimensions of the henge have an exact parallel in St Mary’s Chapel atGlastonbury, which is the reputed site of the earliest Christian chapel.’9Between 1199 and 1254 the Templars had their English headquarters at Baldock,now in Hertfordshire.10 When Rand compared this site to other sacred places henoted that its relationship to the Yukon Pole was precisely the same as aparticular Asian site. Once again, as with the case of Rennes-le-Château andNanking covered in the last chapter, there was a geodetic connection between aEuropean sacred site and an Asian site, and in this case between the ancientcity of Pyongyang in North Korea and the Templar’s English headquarters atBaldock.11Korea has many ancient monuments that are falling into ruin.12 Pyongyang, thecapital of North Korea, is now a busy industrial city but at one time containedpyramids. Korean history is divided into three periods or kingdoms. The earliestwas associated with the gods and was called Koguryo. Sarah Milledge Nelsonwrites of this period:At least two social classes existed in Koguryo from the beginning; a noble classthat lived well and an underclass which may have been made up of conqueredpeoples. The upper class were ‘fond of constructing palatial buildings’13 livedluxuriously with clothes of embroidered silk and gold and silver ornaments, andwere buried in large lavish tombs. Huge Koguryo palaces and tombs have beenunearthed in both China and Korea.14The kingdom known as Choson in Pyongyang dates to 2,333 BC, a time very close tothe building of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. Korean legend tells how PrinceHwanung descended upon Mount Taebaeksan with 3,000 servants, bringing the giftsof civilisation and building a great city15Pyongyang’s co-ordinates are 39 degrees north, 125 degrees, 47 minutes east.During the Hudson Bay Pole, Pyongyang was located at 12 degrees north (alongwith Babylon in the Middle East and Nikko in Japan). During the Greenland SeaPole the city was located at 30 degrees north along with the Xi’an pyramids. Andfinally, and most remarkably, Pyongyang was also at 30 degrees north during theYukon Pole. Pyongyang’s latitudes through time went from 30 degrees north to 30degrees north to 12 degrees north. This made the North Korean capital what Randcalls a ‘geological marker’, of which there are only a few others in the world:Aguni, Byblos, Cuzco, Jericho, Nazca, Pyongyang and Xi’an. These cities were allbuilt at the intersection of sacred latitudes. It seems that ancient surveyorsof Europe, Asia and South America used their knowledge of the earth’s geologicalpast and their ability to calculate vast distances with extreme accuracy toposition geological markers that in time became sacred sites.Rand found other Templar sites that seemed to demonstrate knowledge of theformer position of the poles. La Rochelle, the main port for the Templars inFrance – the place where the famous fleet was said to have disappeared – andMontségur were both located on the Tropic of Cancer during the Yukon Pole. TheTemplars operated out of Rhodes which had been at 10 degrees north during theYukon Pole while Jerusalem had been 5 degrees north. The more he studied theirpast, the more he became convinced that the Templars had obtained maps of theworld of nearly 100,000 years ago from beneath King Solomon’s Temple.But the most startling site turned out to be a tiny chapel in Scotland south ofEdinburgh: Rosslyn.William St Clair built Rosslyn two centuries before the first Templars arerecorded in England. How do we know that St Clair was a Templar? Lomas andKnight uncovered much evidence at Rosslyn, which they describe in their booksThe Hiram Key and The Second Messiah.16 One of the most convincing pieces ofevidence is a carving they found on the wall outside Rosslyn.It depicts a freemason ceremony, with the candidate blindfolded and with a nooseround his neck. The man who holds the rope is a Templar, with the cross on histunic, leaving no doubt that St Clair was a Templar, and that the Templars werealso Freemasons. In fact, Lomas and Knight believe that the building of Rosslynmarks the first appearance of Freemasonry in the UK.Lomas and Knight began to look into the history of the St Clairs of Rosslyn. Itseemed that William de St Clair was a Norman who came over at around the sametime as William the Conqueror in 1066. He was known as William the Seemly. Hisson Henri went off on the First Crusade in 1095, and fought alongside Hugh dePayens, marching into Jerusalem with him, while Hugh married Henri’s niece,Catherine St Clair. The connection of the St Clairs with the Templars was veryclose indeed.[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_025_r1.jpg]An outline of the carving at Rosslyn showing a Knight Templar initiating acandidate into Freemasonry.Why did the St Clairs call their home Rosslyn? A little research revealed thatthey didn’t. The chapel, like the castle, was then called Roslin (as the villageis today). In the 1950s the name had been changed to Rosslyn to pull in thetourists because it sounded more ‘olde wo rlde’. Village names usually havemeanings. Lomas and Knight checked a Scottish Gaelic dictionary and found that‘Ros’ meant knowledge, and ‘linn’ meant generation. They consulted modern Gaelicspeakers and learned that a better translation would be ‘ancient knowledgepassed down the generations’, which sounded exactly what they were hoping for –the place had been specifically named by the Gaelic-speaking Henri St Clair tohint at the Templars’ secret.The dates did not fit, though. Henri had returned from the First Crusade about1100, eighteen years before Hugh de Payens and his knights moved into the Templeand began their search.Yet surely the name Roslin, with its implication of ancient knowledge, could notbe coincidence? The two authors had already wondered precisely why the nineknights went to Jerusalem. Were they merely seeking treasure? Or did theyalready have an idea of what they were looking for? The name Roslin suggestedthat the answer was yes. Studying the chapel more closely, the authors foundsomething even more exciting. One of the pillars had a tableau that showed afigure – presumably a knight – holding up a cloth in both hands. On the cloththere was a bearded face. The head of the figure holding the cloth had beenhacked off, presumably to disguise his identity. Nearby was a frieze showing thecrucifixion, yet it did not seem to be Jesus’s crucifixion. To begin with, thepeople shown were in medieval garb, and some were hooded – members of theInquisition. Another frieze showed Templars with an executioner next to them.The face on the cloth, the authors felt, bore a resemblance to that of JacquesMolay, the Grand Master of the Templars. Molay had not been tortured in thetorture chamber of the Inquisition, but in the Paris headquarters of theTemplars. The rack and suspension chains would not have been available. Lomasand Knight argue that Molay was, in fact, tortured by being crucified.The inquisitor William Imbert, a devout Catholic, would have been horrified tolearn that the Templars denied that Christ was the son of God. And he would havefelt that the Templars’ use of a ceremony of resurrection in their rituals wassimply blasphemous. It would have been highly appropriate to torture Molay bynailing him to a door. Lomas and Knight believe that Rosslyn provides theevidence that this is what happened.After Molay had confessed to whatever the Inquisitors had accused him of, he wastaken down and wrapped in a piece of cloth. He was laid on his bed in this‘shroud’, his body streaming with perspiration and blood containing a highlactic acid content. The authors suggest that the blood and perspiration‘fixed’ Molay’s image on the cloth, in a process similar to that which createsthe image of flowers pressed between the pages of a book. (In The SecondMessiah, they include an appendix by an expert on photography, Dr Alan Mills, onthe chemistry of this process.) The piece of cloth, they believe, is now knownas the Holy Shroud of Turin, the shroud that is supposed to contain the image ofJesus.What evidence is there that the figure on the Shroud of Turin is Jacques Molay?To begin with, there is the interesting fact that in 1988 carbon-14 datingrevealed that the fabric of the shroud was woven between AD 1260 and 1390, whichconclusively rules out the possibility that the shroud was used to wrap the bodyof Jesus. But these dates do cover the arrest and torture of Jacques Molay.There is an even more powerful piece of circumstantial evidence. The shroudbelonged to the family of Geoffrey de Charney, who was roasted to death withJacques Molay in 1314. In 1356, England’s Black Prince routed France’s John II,son of Louis X, at Poitiers. And another Geoffrey de Charney, probably thegrandson of Geoffrey’s brother Jean, died beside his king. Later, whenGeoffrey’s widow Jeanne de Vergy was searching through her husband’s effects,she found a piece of cloth, about 14 feet long, with the brown image of a man onit – a man with a bearded face. Both his front and his back were visible, andbloodstains indicated that he had been crucified with nails through the wrists.The Romans carried out most crucifixions with nails through the wrists, for thepalm is not strong enough to support the weight of a body and tends to tear openvia the fingers. Jesus must have been crucified in this way.Not unnaturally, Jeanne was inclined to believe she was looking at an image ofJesus, and since she had been left penniless by her husband’s death she decidedto put the ‘Holy Shroud’ on display in the church at Lirey, built by herhusband. It drew an unending stream of pilgrims and – presumably – solvedJeanne’s financial problems.Henry of Poitiers, the Bishop of Troyes, declared it to be a fake that had been‘made by human hands’, and tried to seize it. He was unsuccessful, but in 1532the shroud was almost destroyed in a fire, and molten silver burned a number ofholes into it. Luckily, they missed the central image, and when the cloth hadbeen repaired by nuns it looked as good as new. It was moved to Turin Cathedralin 1578.More than five centuries later, on 25 May 1898, it was again put on publicdisplay, and a photographer named Sendono Pia was commissioned to photograph it.And when he looked at the negative, he was amazed to see that he was now lookingat a real face, which could only mean that the brown image itself must have beena negative that had now become positive.Clearly, the Bishop of Troyes was wrong; this was not a forgery, for it had notbeen painted. The ‘miraculous’ reversal of a negative left most pious Catholicsin no doubt that this was an image of Christ himself. A majority of believersstill hold this view.Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince have even developed a highly original theory thatthe image in the shroud is a photographic negative, and that the photographerwas Leonardo da Vinci himself, who filmed his own image on the shroud by aprocess he had invented.17 The dates, of course, are all wrong, since Leonardowas not born until 1452, almost a century after the shroud had first beenexhibited, but they argue that Leonardo swapped his self-portrait for theoriginal shroud.Alan Mills, the photographic expert, believes that immense physical stresscaused the release of oxygen-free radicals in Molay, arguing that these‘photographed’ the image on the shroud, which then developed during the fiftyyears the cloth was stored. Lomas and Knight theorise that after the torture ofJacques Molay and Geoffrey de Charney, the two men were sent back to Charney’sfamily to be nursed back to health, but it seems equally possible that theshroud was simply taken back to Charney’s home by relatives who came to visithim – and Molay – during their next seven years in prison.Lomas and Knight argue that, as the shroud became a famous relic, the Bishop ofTroyes did his best to suppress it, afraid that enough people knew it to be animage of the murdered Jacques Molay to create the danger of a cult of ‘thesecond messiah’, which might cause serious embarrassment to the Church. So theBishop of Troyes announced that it was a forgery, and that the forger had beencaught and the shroud destroyed. In fact, the shroud was hidden and put onexhibition again in 1389, when the fuss had died down.The Rosslyn image of the headless man holding a cloth that contains arepresentation of a bearded head certainly supports the theory that the shroudcontained an image of Jacques Molay. Lomas and Knight found an extremelyinteresting piece of evidence in the twenty-seventh degree of Freemasonry, aritual concerning the false condemnation of the Templars and their denial of thecross. The nineteenth-century occultist A. E. Waite had written a book about theTemplars, but expressed distaste at this ritual, on the grounds that the crossused in it – a cross of Lorraine – had two sets of initials on it, JN and JBM.Waite had been told that these stood for Jesus of Nazareth and Jacques BurgundusMolay. So the Freemason tradition appears to suggest that Molay was crucified.That there was some kind of cult of the Master of the Templars is evidenced byan event that happened in 1793, during the French Revolution; as Louis XIV wasabout to be guillotined, a member of the crowd shouted, ‘Jacques Molay isavenged!’One major mystery of Freemasonry still intrigued Lomas and Knight: why did themurder of Hiram Abif, the architect of Solomon’s Temple, play such an importantpart? In fact, it is the central legend of Freemasonry, and every Mason‘becomes’ Hiram Abif as he undergoes a ritual murder and resurrection in hisinitiation ceremony. As Hiram Abif is resurrected, certain words are spokenaloud. They sound like gibberish: ‘Ma’at-beb-men-aa, Ma’at-ba-aa.’But Christopher Knight happened to know that ‘ma’at’ is an ancient Egyptianword. It meant originally ‘ordered and symmetrical’, like the base of a temple.Then it came to mean righteousness, truth and justice, concepts that play such acentral role in Freemasonry. Knight realised that the ‘gibberish’ is ancientEgyptian, meaning ‘Great is the Master of Ma’at, great is the spirit of Ma’at.’In the Old Testament Hiram is referred to as ‘Hiram the King of Tyre’ (I Kings),and also as ‘Hiram of Tyre’, son of a Tyrian bronzeworker (II Chronicles). Itseems that he was not just the architect of the Temple, but the master builderwho directed operations. He was attacked and killed by three of his own workers,who struck him three blows, apparently because he refused to divulge the secretsignal that would have enabled them to claim a higher rank than they actuallypossessed (and thus higher wages). It all sounds highly unlikely – surelyworkers on the Temple could not get away with such a crudely conceived swindle?Lomas and Knight suspected that the story of Hiram Abif concealed some importanthistorical truth.Why is the ritual of Freemasonry so full of hints that its origin lies inancient Egypt, and why is the Great Pyramid one of its central symbols? Theforefathers of modern America, all Freemasons, were responsible for placing thepyramid symbol on dollar bills. Since there are so many connections between Jewsand Egyptians in the Old Testament, Lomas and Knight felt that the answerprobably lay in historical events involving both nations, which would haveoccurred long before Solomon built the Temple. According to the Book of Genesis,the Jews came into existence after Jacob had wrestled with the angel and hisname was changed to Israel. His twelve sons gave their names to the twelvetribes of Israel. The date seems to have been some time in the middle of thesixteenth century BC.The Jewish historian Josephus had identified the so-called Hyksos, or ShepherdKings, with the Hebrews of the Old Testament. The Hyksos were, in fact, a mixedgroup ofSemitics and Asiatics who moved into Egypt around 1,750 BC – not as warriors,but as refugees from drought. They seized power around 1,630 BC and ruled untilthey were thrown out 108 years later, as a result of a revolt that began atThebes (now Luxor). Although modern scholars do not feel that Josephus wascompletely accurate, there seems little doubt that the ancestry of the Jewsincludes the Hyksos. The Hyksos kings ruled northern Egypt (Lower Egypt), butThebes was ruled by a traditional pharaoh, Sequenenre, whose eldest soninaugurated the revolt.Lomas and Knight were inclined to wonder: was there an Egyptian pharaoh to whomthe story of Hiram Abif might apply?Indeed, there was – and only one. It was Sequenenre himself. It seemed that theHyksos pharaoh of this time was called Apophis or Apopi. Knight remembered abook of Egyptian liturgies called The Book of Overthrowing Apopi, which is fullof magic spells to get rid of him. Moreover, the Hyksos kings increased theirunpopularity by worshipping the storm god Set, whom most Egyptians regarded asthe god of evil.When a pharaoh ascended the throne, he went through a ceremony whose purpose wasto make him into a god – specifically, into Horus, son of Osiris. When he died,he became Osiris, and there was an important ceremony called ‘the Opening of theMouth’, when his mouth was levered open with an adze so that his soul couldrejoin his fellow gods in heaven and take on the task of interceding for hispeople. Apopi would have wanted to know the secret ceremony because after twocenturies the Hyksos had been thoroughly ‘Egyptianised’; they believed that theritual would turn the pharaoh into a god. They saw themselves as upstarts, butthey wanted to become truly Egyptian, and the pharaoh Apopi naturally wanted tobecome a god.Sequenenre was murdered with blows on the head; we know that from his mummy.Lomas and Knight include a gruesome photograph of it with gashes on the skulland one eye missing.The person with the most obvious motive for murdering him would be the Hyksospharaoh Apopi.If Sequenenre was the original of Hiram Abif, then the secret that the threemurderers tried to force from him would be the ritual to make a newly crownedpharaoh into Horus.In the scenario of Lomas and Knight – based on Masonic ritual – Sequenenre wasapproached by three men, called Jubela, Jubelo and Jubelum, whose task was tomake him divulge the secret ritual. He refused, probably with some angry andcontemptuous words – kings do not like being threatened – whereupon the threeruffians went beyond their instructions and killed him with three blows. (Thisis also a basic part of the Masonic tradition – they were not instructed to killHiram Abif, but only to force the secret from him.)Lomas and Knight even add the fascinating speculation – based on Sequenenre’sdates – that Apopi’s ‘grand vizier’, who was behind the plot to force Sequenenreto divulge the secret ritual, was Joseph, son of Jacob, whose brothers sold himinto slavery. They go further and speculate that two of the murderers wereJoseph’s brothers Simeon and Levi. The third murderer, they believe, was a youngpriest of Sequenenre’s temple, dragged into the plot with the threat that Apopimeant to destroy Thebes and that the only way of averting this would be todivulge the ‘god-making’ ritual.Lomas and Knight discovered some extraordinary physical evidence to supporttheir theory. As well as the proof of violent blows on the mummified head ofSequenenre, entombed beside the pharaoh was another mummy whose state hadbaffled Egyptologists. Although the flesh had been mummified by the dry air ofthe tomb, the inner organs had not – as was usual – been embalmed. He had beencastrated, and his face bore an expression of agony. He had clearly been wrappedin bandages while still alive, and died of suffocation.There could be little doubt that this was one of the murderers of the pharaoh.The fact that he was killed so horribly and buried beside Sequenenre suggestedthat he was not a Hyksos but some member of the pharaoh’s entourage who wasbeing punished for treachery. The other two murderers – foreigners – wouldsimply have been executed.But why the castration? Because when the god Horus avenged the murder of hisfather Osiris in a battle with Set, Horus lost an eye and Set lost histesticles. So to punish a treacherous priest in this way would be oddlyappropriate, particularly since Sequenenre had lost his eye.Sequenenre’s son Kamose avenged his father’s murder by fomenting the rebellionthat drove the Hyksos out of Egypt. Kamose became the founder of a new Egyptiandynasty, and the ritual of the murder and resurrection of Osiris, which would beused at his coronation, would be enriched by a new level of meaning – the deathand resurrection of Sequenenre.If Lomas and Knight are correct in believing that the pharaoh who made Josephthe governor of Egypt was Apopi – and the dates seem to support it – then themurder of Sequenenre was of even deeper significance, for Joseph’s father Jacobbecame Israel, the founder of the Jewish people. If Joseph and his family wereamong the Hyksos who were driven out of Egypt, then the murder of Sequenenrealso led to the creation of the Jewish nation, which would help to explain whyit was regarded as so important by the Jews that it was transformed into themurder of Hiram Abif, the architect of Solomon’s Temple.In researching the history of Freemasonry, Lomas and Knight seem to have made astring of extraordinary discoveries. The claim that Freemasonry originated inEgypt would seem to have a sound factual foundation. With the murder of HiramAbif six centuries later, Egyptian mythology was metamorphosed into Jewishmythology, implying that some form of Freemasonry had survived from the time ofSequenenre and involved a ritual death and resurrection. Lomas and Knightproduce compelling evidence to suggest that the ritual was one of the secrets ofthe Essenes that was hidden beneath the Temple after the crucifixion of Jesus,in whose story resurrection also plays a central part. The Essenes, who guardedthe secret, were wiped out by Titus, and the Temple was destroyed. Lomas writesof a ritual of Freemasonry that ‘has a retrospect that tells of the fall of theNasoreans in AD 70, and how the progenitors of Freemasonry left Jerusalem atthat time to spread across Europe’. He also says that these survivors ‘believedthey were preserving the bloodlines of the two Messiahs of David and Aaron, whowould one day arrive and establish the kingdom of God on earth’. Jesus, whom theBaptist Mandaeans (descendants of the Essenes) regard as an impostor, was raisedto the status of a god by St Paul, and when Constantine used Christianity tobind his collapsing empire together, the resurrection became the Church’s mostpowerful claim to supernatural authority.As to the Templars, we can make one of two assumptions: either the nine originalTemplars were among the descendants of the ‘progenitors’ who left Jerusalemafter the destruction of the Temple and went back with the specific intention offinding the Essene documents, or they were looking for treasure and foundinstead the Essene scrolls.Lomas and Knight have no doubt that the former is the correct version of events.In fact, they believe that the First Crusade was deliberately planned to retakeJerusalem so that the knights could undertake the search for the Essene scrolls.When they were found, the illustration of the ‘Heavenly Jerusalem’, identifiedby the old scholar, Lambert of St Omer, revealed that the knights had found whatthey were looking for, and the scrolls became the foundation of the power andwealth of the Knights Templar. Somehow, though, the Church and the King ofFrance learned the Templars’ most carefully guarded secret – they were notChristians, in that they believed Jesus to be a man, not the son of God. Thisserved Philip the Fair as an excuse to arrest the Templars and seize theirwealth. But he failed because someone – probably Pope Clement – tipped off hisrelative at Blanchefort, and theTemplar fleet – of eighteen ships – escaped from La Rochelle with the Templartreasure.Where did they go? The corncobs and aloes in Rosslyn suggests that some of themsailed for America. Other Templars went to Scotland, where an abbey namedKilwinning had been built in the first great days of Templar power, around1140.18 It was just south of Glasgow, and was the Templars’ major centre. Thiswould be a natural refuge, particularly since the St Clair family lived not faraway, in Roslin. Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, had been excommunicated bythe Pope, so Templars had nothing to fear in Scotland.One of the main arguments of The Hiram Key is that Rosslyn Chapel was built indeliberate imitation of Herod’s Temple and as the home of the precious scrolls,which were the most important ‘treasure’ of the Templars. They argue that eventhe unfinished outer wall at Rosslyn, which looks as if the building was simplyabandoned at that point, was a replica of an unfinished wall in Herod’srebuilding of Solomon’s Temple.In 1447, while Rosslyn Chapel was being built, there was a fire in the keep ofRoslin Castle. William St Clair was frantic until he learned that his chaplainhad managed to salvage four great trunks full of charters, whereupon, says therecord, ‘he became cheerful’. Lomas and Knight point out that it sounds odd tovalue four trunks of ‘charters’ more than his castle keep – not to mention hiswife and daughter, who were also inside. If these trunks contained the secretscrolls from Jerusalem, which would have been buried in Rosslyn Chapel, hiscurious priorities become understandable.We should now be able to see the connection between the Templars and the mysteryof Rennes-le-Château. If Pierre Plantard de St Clair is a descendent of the manwho built Rosslyn, then he is also a Templar. The confession that so shocked thelocal priest who attended Sauniére’s death bed was certainly that Sauniére didnot believe that Jesus was the son of God, but was simply a man. And this wouldbe consistent with Henry Lincoln’s suggestion that Jesus came to France withMary Magdalene, and that his descendents were the Merovingian kings.But this, as Lincoln admits, is pure supposition. The truth may be simpler: thatthe Merovingian kings were, in fact, also heirs to the secret known to theTemplars, the secret contained in the Essene scrolls. If this Merovingianconnection is not an invention of Plantard and the Priory of Sion, then it seemsto follow that the Merovingians were an important ‘missing link’ between theEssenes and the Templars.We can see why Nicolas Poussin talked about a great secret that kings would havedifficulty drawing from him. He must have felt that this knowledge – that Jesuswas a man, and that therefore the power of the Church was based upon completelyfalse claims – was dynamite that could cost him, and others privy to the secret,their lives.As I read Lomas and Knight on Hiram Abif, I found myself thinking about anotherinteresting connection. Hiram came from Tyre. And having visited Tyre on a tripto the Lebanon, I knew that it was a Phoenician city, and that the Phoenicianswere not worshippers of Yahweh. Why should Solomon want a Phoenician architect?Presumably because Hiram of Tyre was the best man for the job. But the chiefPhoenician god was Baal or Bel, whom the authors of the Old Testament regardwith suspicion and dislike, and their leading female deity was Astarte, alsocalled Ashtoreth and Ishtar.Rand’s research led him to believe that the Templars were the heirs to ancientgeographic knowledge once possessed by the Phoenicians. He writes:It was their colony in Carthage that indicated that the Phoenicians had oncepossessed ancient maps that depicted the earlier poles. During the Hudson BayPole latitude 30 degrees north crossed Tunisia at Carthage. This city ispresumed to have been established in the ninth century BC but may be much older.The Phoenicians, the ancient world’s most advanced sea power, may have hadaccess to ancient maps that revealed an ancient site beneath Carthage. They mayhave selected this place for reasons that may go back to the time of Atlantis.Its location on the east coast of a tiny peninsula on the Tunisian coast wouldhave presented ancient astronomers with an ideal view of the northern sky fromlatitude 30 degrees. The Mediterranean Sea would have acted as a perfectreflection of the heavens and the horizon would be undisturbed by mountains.On the west coast of Africa there is another Phoenician city which the Romansregarded as the oldest city in the world. Little remains of Lixus, but it wasonce a Phoenician colony on the Atlantic coast of Africa. Certainly the mostamazing Phoenician city was Byblos which, like Pyongyang in Korea and Cuzco inthe central Andes, was linked by sacred latitudes to both the Hudson Bay andYukon Poles. Byblos was sacred to both the Phoenicians and the Egyptians. Forthe Phoenicians it was the oldest city in the world and for the Egyptians it wasthe place that the god Osiris came to rest after his evil brother Seth lockedhim in a casket and set him adrift upon the waters of the Mediterranean Sea.Byblos, along with the megalithic structures at nearby Baalbek, made Randsuspect that there had been an ancient maritime power operating worldwide out ofthis ancient port in Lebanon. Baalbek, as we have seen, may well have been asite constructed by the Fallen Angels that we met in Chapter 7.Rand knew that the largest stones used in construction in the New World were inand around Cuzco, which also had been at a 10 phi latitude before the flood.Sitchin in Lost Realms had commented upon the similarities between Baalbek andCuzco.19 We know now that both sites shared the same sacred latitude (10 phi)before the flood. And it was this latitude where the city of Tiahuanaco at LakeTiticaca was founded. One of the myths associated with Tiahuanaco and LakeTiticaca concerns the god who came from the south after a flood and gave hischildren a device that led them to Cuzco. In When the Sky Fell, Rand and Rosewere fascinated by the myths of the people of the central Andes. They wrote:The famous Peruvian historian, Garcilasso de la Vega, son of a Spanishconquistador and an Inca princess, asked his Inca uncle to tell him the story ofhis people’s origins. How had Lake Titicaca become the source of theircivilisation? The uncle explained: ‘In ancient times all this region which yousee was covered with forests and thickets, and the people lived like brutebeasts without religion nor government, nor towns, nor horses, withoutcultivating the land nor covering their bodies… [the sun-god sent a son anddaughter to]… give them precepts and laws by which to live as reasonable andcivilised men, and to teach them to dwell in houses and towns, to cultivatemaize and other crops, to breed flocks, and to use the fruits of the earth asrational beings.’The ‘gods’ who brought agriculture to the vicinity of Lake Titicaca were said tohave come ‘out of the regions of the south’ immediately ‘after the deluge’. Inother words, agriculture was introduced to Lake Titicaca by people who alreadypossessed the skills and who had been forced to leave their homeland when aflood destroyed their southern land.20In his classic work History of the Conquest of Peru, William Hickling Prescotttold the legend of how Cuzco evolved into one of the most sacred cities of theAndes. This is a tale that tantalises us with the suggestion that some sort oftime or survival capsule was planted at Cuzco before the flood. Prescott relateshow Cuzco became a sacred city after the flood had subsided.The Sun, the great luminary and parent of mankind, taking compassion on theirdegraded condition, sent two of his children, Manco Capac and Mama Oello Huaco,to gather the natives into communities, and teach them the arts of civilisedlife. The celestial pair, brother and sister, husband and wife, advanced alongthe high plains in the neighbourhood of Lake Titicaca, to about the sixteenthdegree south. They bore with them a golden wedge, and were directed to take uptheir residence on the spot where the sacred emblem should without effort sinkinto the ground. They proceeded accordingly but a short distance, as far as thevalley of Cuzco, the spot indicated by the performance of the miracle, sincethere the wedge speedily sank into the earth and disappeared for ever. Here thechildren of the Sun established their residence.21Lost Realms also drew attention to an amazing geometric fact: ‘Maria Schulten deD’Ebneth… in her book La Ruta de Wirakocha… drew lines showing that a 45-degreeline originating at Tiahuanacu, combined with squares and circles of definitemeasurements, embraced all the key ancient sites between Tiahuanacu, Cuzco, andQuito in Ecuador including the all-important Ollantaytambu.22Why would the builders of these ancient sacred sites want to connect these fourcities geometrically? What do Tiahuanaco, Cuzco, Ollantaytambo and Quito have incommon?Charles Piazzi Smyth believed that the Great Pyramid should be the site of theprime meridian. As we have seen, Tiahuanaco lies 100 degrees west of the GreatPyramid. And Quito, at the equator, lies 110 degrees west of Giza. This wouldseem to indicate that Tiahuanaco and Quito were constructed after the Giza PrimeMeridian was established.So it seemed that ancient Egypt and Peru had a powerful geodetic link. Severalauthors had speculated upon the mythological connection between the Egyptiangod, Osiris, and the god, Viracocha, of the people of the central Andes.23Osiris was believed to have travelled around the globe bringing civilisation tomany nations.Viracocha was the ‘god’ who brought agriculture and civilisation to the Andes.He was tall, of pale complexion, bearded and dressed in a long white robe. Themyths tell us that this stranger came from the south and settled among thenative people of Lake Titicaca some time after the flood. He brought instructionin the arts of agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine, metallurgy and evenwriting, which the Inca claim was later forgotten. Two groups of men accompaniedhim on his mission. One group were huaminca, ‘faithful soldiers’, and anotherhayuaypanti, meaning ‘shining ones’, who spread the word of Viracocha throughoutthe world.24The ‘golden wedge’, which Sitchin calls a ‘golden wand’, seems to be a kind ofhoming device that led the Children of the Sun directly to Cuzco as if towards abeacon situated beneath the ground. In 1575, Cristobal de Molina offered thefollowing Andean prayer to the sun-god Viracocha: * Oh! Day-King, Sun, my Father! * May there be a Cuzco: * may the Capable One be he who measures.25Shining ones appeared in the Andes and in the mountains of the Middle East afterthe flood. And in both cases, their great concern was with measurement. Didancient Andean mythology point to Cuzco as a sacred site? Is there a rationalexplanation beneath the mythological record? Was there some sort oftechnological or scientific reason for the ‘golden wedge’? And what does it allhave to do with ‘measures’? The ‘golden wedge’ of Cuzco, the ‘omphalos’ ofDelphi and the ‘cording of the Temple’ in ancient Egypt are all part of amysterious web which spans the globe, a pattern that tempts us to believe thatthe sacred sites that haunt our landscape are not scattered across the earth atrandom but are rather part of a deliberate design.The significant line discovered by Maria D’Ebneth that connected Tiahuanaco andCuzco extended all the way to the equator where it intercepted Quito, thenorthern capital of the Inca empire. Before the Earth’s mantle/crust shiftedposition, Quito was located at 30 degrees north. The Inca Trail, which is one ofthe great wonders of the ancient world, ran from Cuzco in the south to Quito inthe north. This link between Cuzco and Quito is quite literal. One can stillwalk the Inca Trail from Cuzco to Quito today.Prescott’s History of the Conquest of Peru records that the Inca were desperateto maintain the Cuzco—Quito connection. Huayana Capac, the father of the lastInca, Atahuallpa, died around 1525, some seven years before Pizarro’s arrivalbrought an end to that great empire. When Huayana Capac died ‘his heart wasretained in Quito, and his body, embalmed after the fashion of the country, wastransported to Cuzco, to take its place in the great temple of the Sun, by theside of the remains of his royal ancestors’.26Atahuallpa was eventually murdered by Pizarro, but before he died he ‘expresseda desire that his remains might be transported to Quito, the place of his birth,to be preserved with those of his maternal ancestors’.27 Pizarro refused thisrequest and instead buried the remains of the last Inca in a Christian cemetery.‘But from thence, as is reported, after the Spaniards left Caxamalca, they weresecretly removed, and carried, as he had desired, to Quito.’28Prescott tells us thatthe royal edifices of Quito, we are assured by the Spanish conquerors, wereconstructed of huge masses of stone, many of which were carried all the wayalong the mountain roads from Cuzco, a distance of several hundred leagues.And while the capitals of Christendom, but a few hundred miles apart, remainedas far asunder as if seas had rolled between them, the great capitals of Cuzcoand Quito were placed by the high roads of the Incas in immediatecorrespondence.Quito, which lay immediately under the equator, where the vertical rays of thesun threw no shadow at noon, was held in especial veneration as the favouredabode of the great deity29It would seem that information buried at Cuzco before the displacement may haveprovided the people of ancient America with a blueprint for laying out theirpost-flood sacred sites. This blueprint linked Cuzco to Tiahuanaco and Cuzco toQuito and so the 45-degree ‘ley line’ that connects these ancient sacred sitesbegins to make geodetic sense. Ollantaytambo and Machu Picchu are so close toCuzco that they should be considered a group, with Cuzco at the centre being the‘navel of the world’. The monuments at Ollantaytambo were constructed with thelargest stones used in the New World. Sitchin links Ollantaytambo with ancientBaalbek in Lebanon:The many similarities we find between Ollantaytambu and Baalbek include theorigin of the megaliths. The colossal stone blocks of Baalbek were quarriedmiles away in a valley, then incredibly lifted, transported, and put in place tofit with other stones of the platform. At Ollantaytambu too the giant stoneblocks were quarried on the mountainside on the opposite side of the valley. Theheavy blocks of red granite, after they had been quarried, hewed, and shaped,were then transported from the mountainside, across two streams, and up theOllantaytambu site; then carefully raised, put precisely in place, and finallyfused together.30Little could Sitchin suspect that Ollantaytambo and Baalbek are the samedistance from the Hudson Bay Pole and share the 10 phi latitude. The fact isthat the largest stones used in construction in both the Old and New World arefound at the same distance to the Hudson Bay Pole. This worldwide geodesicpattern repeatedly emphasises the importance of the geometric notion of theGolden Section married to the number 10.When the people of ancient Israel conquered ‘Canaan’ they were occupying thehomeland of the Phoenicians, who regarded themselves as the heirs of the muchearlier maritime Byblos culture. The Phoenicians had drawn upon the Byblos fortheir art, culture and architecture. The Israelites respected the achievementsof the Phoenicians and drew upon their architecture in the building of KingSolomon’s Temple.In The Temple and the Lodge31 Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh assert that‘modern archaeological research confirms that Solomon’s Temple… bears anunmistakable resemblance to the actual temples built by the Phoenicians… It iseven possible to go a step further. Tyrian temples were erected to thePhoenician mother goddess Astarte… hilltops and mountains – Mount Hermon forexample – abounded with her shrines.’ And they point out that King Solomon isalso described (I Kings 3) as offering ‘sacrifice and incense on the highplaces’.They draw attention to the fact that Solomon’s religion was not strictlyorthodox. When he grew old ‘his wives swayed his heart to other gods… Solomonbecame a follower of Astarte’ (I Kings 11). They even state that the famous Songof Songs is a hymn to Astarte. They then ask the question: ‘Was [the Temple]dedicated to the God of Israel, or was it dedicated to Astarte?’This may seem academic until we recall that Astarte was known to the Greeks asAphrodite, the goddess of love (from which we get the term aphrodisiac), and tothe Romans as Venus. And Henry Lincoln, for one, believes that the planet Venuswas the reason that the pentacle is perhaps the most important of magic symbols.So the man who built Solomon’s Temple was a worshipper of Venus, and hisemployer also had leanings in that direction.When we recall that the geometry of Rennes-le-Château is pentacular, we cansuddenly see another connection with Solomon’s Temple and the Templars. Thewhole area has connections with Merovingians and Templars and the religion ofgnosticism. The kind of gnosticism that led to the extermination of the Catharswas a belief that matter is created by the Devil and spirit by God, so ‘thisworld’ is evil. But according to Lomas and Knight the Essenes had a differentversion of gnosticism. ‘Gnosis’ means knowledge, and the Essenes held that whena man awakens to ‘gnosis’, he is ‘resurrected’. Priests and saviours becomeunnecessary, because he now possesses the ‘knowledge’ himself. Such a positionis, of course, anathema to all forms of established religion that depend onpriestly authority, for it makes them unnecessary. It could be compared toQuakerism, with its belief in the ‘inner light’, and also to Buddhism, with itsconcept of enlightenment.In reading Lomas and Knight, I had been particularly interested in Kilwinning,the original Templar abbey built in Scotland, for Rand had included it among hissacred sites. Recognising the importance of the Golden Section in theirpositioning, he had tried measuring the Golden Section from the North Pole (34degrees, 23 minutes north), and had discovered two other important sacred sitesat this latitude, the Chinese pyramids and Ehdin (the O’Briens’ Eden). Measuringthe Golden Section from the equator (55 degrees, 37 minutes north), he couldfind nothing in North America or Asia, but he found Kilwinning only 3 minutes ofa degree away, at 55 degrees, 40 minutes north. And when he learned (from TheHoly Blood and the Holy Grail) about Kilwinning, he checked its positioncompared to the Great Pyramid, and found that it was 36 degrees – one-tenth of360 degrees, the total distance around the earth. When he learned thatKilwinning was reputed to be built on an ancient pagan site, he was furtherencouraged.He checked Rosslyn’s latitude; it was 55 degrees, 52 minutes north, only 15minutes out – not bad, but still 17 miles too many. Then he checked its locationwith regard to the Hudson Bay Pole. It was precisely 50 degrees north. In anemail telling me of this discovery, Rand wrote:What made Rosslyn so special was its position relative to today’s North Pole andthe North Pole during the Hudson Bay Pole. Stand outside Rosslyn Chapel facingnorth-west and raise your right arm so the tip of your index finger is pointingto the North Pole. Now raise your left arm and point at the Hudson Bay Pole. Anangle is formed by the tips of your fingers and your nose This angle isprecisely 50 degrees. Rosslyn was formerly at 50 degrees north and the angledifference between it, the North Pole and the Hudson Bay Pole is exactly 50degrees. This made it a 50/50 site, and indicates that accurate geodetic andgeological information was used in its location.If the Templars deliberately sited Rosslyn on a phi latitude that was also a‘50/50 site’, then it looked as if they must also have had knowledge of thisworldwide grid of sacred sites.For me, this was further confirmed by Lomas and Knight’s reference to theprophet Enoch. In The Hiram Key there are merely three brief references to him.Towards the end of The Second Messiah, there is a passage about the thirteenthdegree of Scottish Freemasonry, whichtells how, in times long before Moses and Abraham, the ancient figure of Enochforesaw that the world would be overwhelmed by an apocalyptic disaster throughflood or fire, and he determined to preserve at least some of the knowledge thenavailable to man, that it might be passed on to future civilisations ofsurvivors. He therefore engraves in hieroglyphics the great secrets of scienceand building on to two pillars: one made of brick and the other of stone.The Masonic legend then goes on to tell how these pillars were almost destroyed,but sections survived the Flood and were subsequently discovered – one by theJews, the other by the Egyptians…So, according to the Masons, the origins of Freemasonry – the two pillars thatplay a central part in its rituals – can be traced back to Enoch.When I first read The Hiram Key I assumed that this was simply another more orless fictional attempt to establish the ancient origins of Freemasonry, but bythe time I finished The Second Messiah, it seemed to me that Lomas and Knighthad made an extremely plausible case for the Egyptian origin of Freemasonry andfor secret knowledge that could be traced through Solomon’s Temple, the Essenesand the Templars. The notion that the Book of Enoch might be involved came as nosurprise. Rand’s When the Sky Fell had already left me in no doubt that ancientmemories of the Great Flood have survived down the millennia.Lomas and Knight emphasise that the tradition of Enoch and the flood is ofcentral importance to Freemasonry, and in their third volume, Uriel’s Machine,Enoch is virtually the central figure. As already noted, Lomas and Knightbelieve that the flood was caused by the impact of a comet in 7,640 BC, and thatthe ancients were able to anticipate this impact by using ‘Uriel’s machine’.There are also no fewer than thirty-two references to the planet Venus, which,they explain, ‘symbolises rebirth in Judaism, Freemasonry and many other ancienttraditions’.There is, then, a convergence of Masonic tradition and other arguments aboutancient civilisation. It was Rand who pointed out one of the most fascinatingimplications of the Templar tradition of an important discovery in the remainsof Solomon’s Temple: the evidence that part of the Templar fleet that left LaRochelle in 1307 made its way to America. (Of course it is believed that theVikings had found their way to America centuries before Columbus, but they didnot cross the Atlantic, but stuck to the coast of Greenland.) Before Columbus‘discovered’ America, did one of the Templar ships that had sailed to Americalater return to Scotland?The corncobs in Rosslyn suggest that some of the Templars sailed for America.Lomas and Knight mention that Westford, Massachusetts, has an image of a Templarknight carved on a slab of rock, while at Newport, Rhode Island, there is acurious tower constructed in the manner of Templar round churches.But it is unlikely that Templars fleeing from imminent arrest and torture wouldset sail across the Atlantic unless they knew where they were going. How couldthey have known about America? The only answer can be that they had a map ormaps. Could they have obtained such maps from the ‘treasure’ that Hugh de Payensand the knights discovered in 1126 in the basement of the Temple in Jerusalem?In The Hiram Key, Lomas and Knight comment: ‘Josephus… observed that the Essenesbelieved that good souls have their habitation beyond the ocean… across the seasto the west.’ This land is marked by the star that the Mandaeans of Iraq called‘Merica’, and which Lomas and Knight suggest is Venus. They believe that it wasfrom this star that America took its name – not from the explorer AmerigoVespucci.In short, what the Templars discovered in Jerusalem included the knowledgecontained in Hapgood’s ‘maps of the ancient sea kings’."},{"pageContent":"10THE LEGACYAS YOU FLY east from La Paz in the Bolivian Andes, the dense green of the junglesuddenly gives way to open grasslands that extend as far as the eye can see.This is the swampy flood plain of the Mamoré River, a tributary of the Amazon,which is underwater one half of the year and bone dry the other half. The fewinhabitants simply have to move to higher land during the flood season.In 1962, an American student at the University of California, Berkeley, BillDenevan, who realised that many areas of this immense land are virtuallyunknown, persuaded the pilot of a Bolivian airliner to divert north over theMoxos Plain, an area called Beni. Suddenly he was goggling with excitement,rushing from side to side of the plane with his camera. What he saw below himwas a landscape in two shades of green, the lighter green lying on thesurrounding darker green in short, broad strokes, as if an abstract painter hadtaken a whitewash brush and slapped a green-tinted wash over the flat landscapein V-shaped patterns. The lighter green, he realised later, was raised fields,in effect platforms of earth that had once been surrounded by flood-filledditches. Looking ahead, a distance of perhaps 50 miles, he could see anotherlight green patch of landscape about the size of a fairly large village. It wasall around him – a landscape with circular fields and raised mounds oftree-covered earth, and straight lines that ran towards the horizon for hundredsof miles. There were also square lakes, obviously man-made.What excited Denevan was its sheer scale. Whoever had civilised this vastlandscape had spread their raised fields, ditches and reservoirs over thousandsof acres. Yet no one had ever heard of a great civilisation in the Amazon.Columbus, of course, had not penetrated this far, and when the SpanishConquistadores arrived in the late 1600s they had found nothing to indicate thepresence of an ancient people – just a few thousand Indians who were forciblyconverted to Christianity.When Denevan returned to the United States, he tried to interest archaeologistsin this vanished people but failed completely. No one believed him. Eventually,an archaeologist named Oscar Saavedra, from the region’s largest town, Trinidad,began to explore the ancient landscape. He soon realised that the fields ran tohundreds of thousands, that there were thousands of forest-covered mounds towhich the inhabitants retreated during floods, and that there were over athousand miles of causeways. As Saavedra penetrated the waterways with theiroverhanging trees in a motor-driven boat, he was actually travelling through aman-made waterscape that extended for hundred of thousands of square miles, asfar as the borders of Bolivia and Brazil. These canals often connected rivers onthe great swampy plain, so that the whole area might be compared to Venice, butthousands of times larger.There are also earthworks that depict people and animals that have been comparedto the Nazca lines, one anthropomorphic figure being 2 kilometres from head totoe. It is believed that these various structures were built by the Paitititribe 5,500 years ago,1 but Denevan dismisses this estimate as grosslyexaggerated.Then how old is it? Ceramic heads and utensils that farmers found in theirfields could not be dated, but other artifacts could be carbon-dated to 5,000BC. Denevan’s own feeling is that an age of a couple of thousand years is closerto the truth. Even so, it would be as old as anything then known in SouthAmerica. (No one believed that Tiahuanaco, that other great Boliviancivilisation, could be dated any further back than a few centuries BC.)What had happened to the builders? Some pieces of evidence suggested that theirdescendants had still been around in large numbers when Columbus crossed theAtlantic in 1492, but by the time the Spaniards arrived two centuries later theyhad all but vanished. It was easy to see why no one had noticed them. Theirlives appeared to be a continuous battle against nature, although theiragriculture must have been capable of supporting a population that could easilyhave run to millions. (Historians have calculated that North and South Americabefore 1492 might have contained 100 million people.)2 When they vanished, theland quickly returned to nature.Denevan’s theory is that they may have been killed off by diseases brought bythe white man, such as smallpox, measles and influenza, which swept across thecontinent like the Black Death, wiping out 90 per cent of the population.What particularly interested me about the agricultural and forest-covered moundsin the Amazon was that this settlement answered a question that Rand and I hadbeen asked repeatedly: if there are vanished civilisations, then where are thetraces of their existence?Rand always made the same reply. They might be lost under the sea, or the ice ofAntarctica. Or they might by lying unnoticed under our noses, as the Moxoscivilisation of the Amazon went unnoticed before Denevan persuaded the pilot tofly over it. Even around Tiahuanaco, which has been known since the time of theConquistadores, no one suspected the sheer size of the civilisation thatsurrounded the present ruins, though the immense stone blocks of its port area –some weighing over 400 tons – which once looked out across Lake Titicaca, oughtto have alerted scholars to the possibility that this was once a city on thescale of ancient Rome or the sacred Mexican city of Teotihuacan rather than anisolated town in the middle of a plain.Not only were such sites found all over the world, but Rand’s theory offered hima means of locating them. His method had led him to pinpoint Lubaantum, the Mayasacred centre in Belize, by looking for a specific spot 120 degrees west of theGreat Pyramid and at a 10 phi longitude north of the equator. He had alsodiscovered three immensely important sites at polar Golden Section latitudes(i.e., the Golden Section measured from the poles rather than from the equator).They were Baalbek, Ehdin (the O’Briens’ Garden of Eden), and the Chinesepyramids. Tracing this line on to the east of China, he found that it passedthrough another sacred site of immense importance: Isé, in Japan (to which I haddedicated a page in my Atlas of Sacred Sites). He continued along the line andfound a group of islands located on his ‘sacred latitude’: the Canary Islands,700 miles off the coast of Spain, at 45 degrees west of the Great Pyramid – thatis, one-eighth of the distance around the world. And they were, of course, ‘phisites’.The Canaries are most commonly regarded as a holiday destination, but not as thelocation of any sacred temples or pyramids. Rand, though, recollected readingsomething about them in a book by the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl.In 1969, twenty years after The Kon-Tiki Expedition3 had become an internationalbestseller, Heyerdahl again set out to prove that ancient seamen could havecrossed vast oceans – this time, from Egypt to America. He succeeded – at thesecond attempt – in a boat built of papyrus reeds. In his book The RaExpeditions,4 describing these ocean voyages, he pauses to speak about themystery of the natives of the Canary Islands, the Guanches.The Guanches were discovered by the Spaniards who sailed in the wake ofColumbus, and who, in the typical manner of the Conquistadores, virtuallyexterminated them. They were tall, blue-eyed and blond, and are described byEncyclopaedia Britannica as of the Cro-Magnon type. One authority compares themto the natives of Muges, in Portugal, whose origins can be traced to about 8,000BC.5How did they get there? They must have come by sea, yet they were farmers andsheep breeders and possessed no boats. In fact, they detested the sea.Heyerdahl’s suggestion is that the Guanches arrived on boats of papyrus reeds,like the Ra, and never mastered the technique of making wooden craft with joinedplanks. Another oddity was that they practised mummification and cranialtrepanning, as in ancient Egypt and Peru. Were they, as Heyerdahl suggests,sailing across the Atlantic, on their way to America, when they discovered theCanaries, and decided to settle there?Another authority on the Guanches, the Brazilian Dr Arysio Nunes dos Santos, haspointed out that their language is related to the ‘Dravidian’ family oflanguages from India,6 but what would Aryan types from India be doing in theCanaries? Santos advances the theory that they were natives of Atlantis,escaping after the great catastrophe, and that Atlantis was somewhere in theregion of Indonesia. Santos may, of course, be mistaken in calling the homelandof the Guanches Atlantis’, but he could still be correct about where they camefrom, and when. At all events, Heyerdahl bore in mind the mystery of theGuanches. And when, in 1998, a native of the Canaries told him about black stonepyramids, he hastened to go and see for himself.The pyramids — eight of them — were discovered near the town of Guimar, onTenerife. They had six steps, and bore a distinct resemblance to the steppyramids of South America. One was even in the centre of the town, but no onehad paid it much attention because it looked like a series of terraces with aflat top. Heyerdahl recognised it for what it was, persuading a Norwegianbusinessman to buy the pyramids and set up a museum.If Rand is correct, some of the Guanches preferred to remain on the Canariesbecause they are at a sacred latitude and longitude, a suitable spot forsettling and for building temples to the sun.The Moxos Plain of Bolivia and the Guimar pyramids on Tenerife are two examplesof civilisations that vanished — or at least, retreated into unrecognisabilityHeyerdahl had found yet another in northern Peru, when he was looking forevidence of ancient seafaring that might prove his theory that natives of SouthAmerica sailed across the Pacific.7One day in March 1987 Heyerdahl was driving north from the ruins of Chan Chan,the former capital of the Chimu Indians, which is near the coastal city ofTrujillo. Driving along the Pan-American Highway, he was looking for a solitarypyramid that he had once seen in the middle of the desert. He was unsuccessful,but he bumped into an old friend, the museum director Christopher Donnan, whowas excavating a pre-Inca city called Pacatnamu, and told him a curious taleabout robbery and violence.A month earlier, on 6 February 1987, a group of tomb robbers dug their way intoa small pyramid near a village called Sipan, near Chiclayo. To call it a pyramidwould strike the visitor to Sipan as an exaggeration, for the three pyramids ofSipan look more like weathered hills scored with hundreds of water channels. Thepeople of the area, however, know they are ancient tombs, and that smallartifacts they find there, such as beads, can be sold to foreign tourists for afew pesos. Some of these amateur tomb robbers had sunk a shaft from the top ofone of the pyramids, called Huaca Rajada, then dug outwards from it.The looters often spent all night searching the tunnels made of adobe bricks andfound nothing, but on this occasion they were in luck. In a groove between twobricks, their leader— an unemployed lorry driver named Ernil — found eighthammered gold beads. On the black market they were worth around $17 each.Eagerly, Ernil drove a tyre-iron into the ceiling – and was knocked to the floorby a landslide of rubble and sand. When ten fellow thieves rushed up to see whathad happened, they found that the prone Ernil was covered with golden artifacts,obviously worth a fortune. Ernil had punctured the floor of a burial chamber,and it proved to be full of gold and silver knives, gold masks, chains of beadsand statuettes of jaguars and horned monsters.The looters carried off eleven rice sacks filled with treasure. There was enoughgold to make them all rich. Unfortunately, they quarrelled during the divisionof the spoils. One man was killed with three gunshots to the chest. Another ofthe looters took to his heels and called the police. Not long afterwards, Ernilwas killed when the police came to try and arrest him.The local museum curator, Walter Alva, was called in to examine the capturedloot. He realised immediately that the robbers had found the Peruvian equivalentof Tutankhamen’s tomb, although these magnificent artifacts were not as old asthose of the boy pharaoh. They had been created by a civilisation of Indianscalled the Moche, who flourished from about AD 100 to AD 700. Then they abruptlyvanished. The reason for their disappearance was a mystery until the late 1990s,when it was realised that there had been a forty-year drought in Peru in thesixth century AD. The heavy rains caused by El Niño ceased, and the Mochestarved. This was the same drought that, archaeologists speculate, led theIndians of the Nazca Plains of Peru to create their vast menagerie of animals –monkeys, whales, spiders, birds – visible only from the air, in a vain attemptto persuade the gods to send back the rain.Regrettably most of the treasure of the Huaca Rajada had already been sold bythe time the police went to arrest Ernil. Walter Alva told the story to ThorHeyerdahl as the two stood at the bottom of the robbers’ shaft, and he permittedHeyerdahl to examine a superb gold mask, with eyes made of blue lapis lazuli. AsHeyerdahl looked at it, he thought again about the legends of the gods who cameto South America, bringing civilisation with them.While the Mexicans believe that the god Quetzalcoatl came from the east, thePeruvians in the Lambayeque Valley, where the pyramids are situated, have alegend of a king called Naymlap, who arrived from the west on a balsa wood raftand led his followers inland for a mile, where he built palaces at a placecalled Chot. Like Quetzalcoatl and Kon Tiki, he was worshipped as a god, andwhen he died his followers buried him in a pyramid and announced that he hadflown away. A Jesuit priest named Cabello, who recorded the ancient tradition,declared that Naymlap was succeeded by eleven generations of kings, who werealso buried in pyramids.This all came to an end when the last of the kings, Fempellec, was seduced by ademon in the guise of a beautiful woman. After that, the gods sent storms,followed by the Great Drought. To propitiate them, Fempellec was tied up andthrown into the sea, but it was too late to avert catastrophe.After the Moche came conquerors called the Chimu, who built Chan Chan, and werein turn conquered by the Incas, whose civilisation was so vast that it neededtwo capital cities. But the Inca empire lasted for a mere century before thearrival of the Spaniards, who brought this cycle of great civilisations to anend.As Heyerdahl stared at the blue-eyed mask, Alva told him of more pyramids, about130 miles north, at a place called Túcume, and offered to take him there. Andso, at dusk on that March day, Heyerdahl found himself looking at seventeenpyramids that might have been mistaken for natural hills, scored into runnels byEl Niño. In fact, photographs make them look rather like the giant hills ofchina clay waste in the St Austell area of Cornwall where I live.As far as archaeology was concerned, these were virgin territory. Heyerdahldecided there and then that, for the next year or so, Túcume would be his home,until the pyramids had given up their secrets.It was a risky venture for the seventy-three-year-old Norwegian. To begin with,Peru was full of terrorist guerrillas who called themselves the Shining Path;they had even stolen the telephone lines connecting Túcume to civilisation. Andthen the villagers of Túcume regarded the pyramids as their own property;Heyerdahl was an intruder, and a naked dead man, found shot in the head at thefoot of one of the pyramids, may have been intended as a warning. They alsoaccused this foreign intruder of being a thief – they were soon telling a storyabout how Heyerdahl had found a duck and twelve ducklings in pure gold and soldthem. As soon as it became clear that Heyerdahl was providing the villagers withthe employment they so badly needed, though, hostility turned to friendlinessand they even ceased to steal from him.Heyerdahl and his team found no treasure comparable to that uncovered at Sipanby Ernil and his fellow thieves, but early in 1992 he found something that meanteven more to the explorer. One of the archaeologists, Alfredo Narvaez, was toldabout a small pyramid that had been penetrated by looters. Narvaez found alooters’ pit with two spiny trees growing in its centre. As a workman wasclearing these away, he saw that one tree had the form of a cross, which isregarded as sacred by the locals. The workman made an offering to the tree, andasked it to help them find ‘beautiful things’.One week later, they had uncovered a wall decorated with a frieze showing a raftmade of balsa wood. Here was evidence not only that the people who built thepyramids were seafarers, but that they used the same type of raft that had oncecarried Thor Heyerdahl across the Pacific to Polynesia.And so, with the balsa frieze of the Moche and the step pyramids of Tenerife,Heyerdahl felt that he had established evidence that ancient voyagers wereplying the Pacific and the Atlantic long before Columbus – a view, of course,that accords perfectly with that of Ivar Zapp and George Erikson.As soon as I read Heyerdahl’s Pyramids of Túcume,8 I emailed Rand to ask whetherthe site had any significance for our Atlantis blueprint. Regrettably, theanswer finally turned out to be no. But while searching his atlas for TúcumeRand noticed Trujillo, where Heyerdahl had been staying when he learned ofTúcume, and which fits the pattern perfectly. Rand wrote:Trujillo is a Giza Prime Meridian site, being 110 degrees west of the GreatPyramid. It shares this longitude with Quito (the northern end of the Incatrail) and North Bimini. It is midway between Tiahuanaco (100 degrees west ofGiza), being 10 degrees to its east, and four sites a further 10 degrees to thewest (at 120 degrees): Copan, Lubaantum, Quiriga and Chichen Itza.By the time of his next email Rand had located Túcume and seen that it isseveral hours to the north of Trujillo. Trujillo, Peru’s third largest city, isclose to the huge Chimu ruins of Chan Chan, covering 11 square miles, as well asthe two other major sites of the Huaca Esmeralda and Huaco del Dragon, and 6miles to the south are the magnificent pyramids of the Sun and Moon, the formerthe largest in Peru, which were built 700 years earlier by the Moche. Trujillocould indeed be regarded as a major sacred site. What is significant is thatRand had identified Trujillo as a sacred site before he knew of these templesand pyramids, and this sprang out of the discovery he had made while studyingthe Giza prime meridian.Heyerdahl had come upon an other equally striking piece of evidence. InSeptember 1976, the mummy of Rameses II, the last of the great Egyptianpharaohs, who died in 1,213 BC, arrived in Paris, to form the centrepiece of anexhibition at the Museum of Mankind. Rameses had spent much of his life battlingthe Hittites, and the great hall of columns in the temple at Karnak is perhapshis finest memorial.When the mummy was examined, it was found to be deteriorating. Scientists wereasked to repair the damage. One of these was Dr Michelle Lescot, of the NaturalHistory Museum, who found herself examining a piece of mummy bandage under anelectron microscope.9 To her astonishment, she recognised grains of tobacco,which seemed odd, for tobacco first came to Europe from South America in thetime of Christopher Columbus.The announcement of her find caused a storm. Egyptologists declared that thetobacco grains must have come from the pipe of some modern scientist who wassmoking as he studied the mummy, so Dr Lescot took samples from deep inside themummy. Again she found tobacco grains. Still the ‘experts’ refused to admit it.They said the grains probably came from some other plant, such as henbane, whichwas a member of the tobacco family. Dr Lescot knew they weren’t, but decided notto press her point.Fifteen years passed, then, in 1992, German researchers in Munich began studyingthe materials used by the ancient Egyptians in mummification. Since they wantedto find out whether any drug was present, they turned to a forensic scientistwhose expertise had often been called upon by the police in cases of suspiciousdeaths. Her name was Dr Svetlana Balabanova, of the Institute of ForensicMedicine in Ulm.Dr Balabanova was not asked to study the mummy of anybody as distinguished as agreat pharaoh; this was a mere priestess called Henut Taui, who died around1,000 BC in Thebes. Her tomb was plundered by robbers in the nineteenth century,and the mummy was sold to Ludwig I, Bavaria’s art-loving monarch, who gave it tothe museum in Munich. Dr Balabanova tested the mummy with a method that dependson antibody reactions, and also through a machine that analyses the molecularweights of substances and shows them in the form of a graph. Both methods showedthat the mummy not only contained nicotine, but also the drug cocaine.10 Cocaineis native to the Andes. When the tired traveller arrives at a hotel in La Paz orCuzco, he is given a cup of tea made from coca leaves, which instantly relievesthe dizziness resulting from the high altitude. It looked as if the Egyptianshad known about its preservative properties more than 3,000 years ago.Lescot’s findings suggested that the Egyptians must have been in contact withthe natives of the east coast of America, but if Balabanova was correct, itlooked as if the ancient Egyptians had made it as far as the opposite coast too.As Heyerdahl knew, the ancient Peruvians also mummified their dead.The reception of Svetlana Balabanova’s analyses was even stormier than in thecase of Michelle Lescot. She received abusive and insulting letters, accusingher of being a fantasist. She replied by publishing her figures and graphs, atwhich the archaeological establishment fell back upon its second line of defence— contamination. When Balabanova replied that, as a forensic scientist, that wasthe first thing she had ruled out, they came up with another explanation: themummy was a ‘forgery’, a fake concocted by enterprising Arabs. Other tests,including carbon-dating, proved that to be untrue.Embarrassed by this publicity, the museums concerned were inclined to try andforget the whole thing. But Dr Balabanova refused. She went on testing mummies,and she regularly found traces of tobacco and cocaine. The sceptics continued toinsist that it must be some other type of tobacco, native to Europe and longextinct, but that failed to explain the cocaine.Someone else recalled that in 1975 Roman jars had been found off the coast ofBrazil in a bay known as the Bay of Jars.11 In fact, jars had been turning upthere for centuries, almost certainly from a sunken Roman galley. Since Romanhistorians would probably have mentioned trans-Atlantic voyages if they hadknown about them, we can probably assume that the galley was swept out to sea bystorms and carried across the Atlantic by the same westward currents that hadcarried Heyerdahl’s Ra. In the case of the Egyptians, the sheer quantity of‘cocaine mummies’ ruled out this explanation.Since Egyptologists have found no other signs of tobacco or cocaine in ancientEgypt, we may probably assume that there was no regular trade in thesecommodities. They must have been brought to Egypt at great expense forpreserving the mummies of kings and queens and guaranteeing their immortality.We must face the conclusion that the Egyptian priests were aware of the greatcontinent across 3,000 miles of ocean, and knew that it could be reached bytaking advantage of the currents. Unless they landed on the east coast, andtrekked across forests and prairies and mountains to reach Peru, we must alsoassume they sailed around the Cape of Storms (unless they took the even longerroute across the Pacific). There could hardly be stronger evidence of Hapgood’sancient ocean-going civilisation.[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_026_r1.jpg]While examining the subject of America, it is interesting to consider Hapgood’sMaps of the Ancient Sea Kings for its account of ‘the remarkable map of HadjiAhmad’, which appeared in Turkey in 1559.We note that the shape of Europe is not particularly accurate – theMediterranean, for example, is entirely the wrong shape, and it is not clearwhether the body of water running south from it is supposed to be the Red Sea orthe Persian Gulf. Hapgood points out that the coast of Africa does not comparein accuracy with the Piri Reis map of nearly half a century earlier.On the other hand, the American continent is so accurate that we could easilymistake it for a modern map. It is hard to believe that Columbus had arrived amere sixty-seven years earlier. How had the mapmaker gained such accurateknowledge, when the continent was still mostly a vast wilderness? Above all, howhad the Pacific coast been drawn with such precision? Pizarro and hisConquistadores had landed on the coast of Peru as recently as 1532, a meretwenty-seven years earlier. There was little time for such knowledge of detailto have been developed.A further oddity of this Hadji Ahmad map is that it shows Asia and Alaska joinedtogether. It does not, admittedly, show Beringia, the land bridge across theBering Strait, which was submerged by the sea at the end of the last Ice Age,but if the two continents had been separate, as they are today, it would havebeen easy enough to indicate this with a narrow gap between them.Hapgood quoted an Oxford scientist, Derek S. Allan,12 who pointed out that whatis now the island of Novya Zemlya is shown as being joined to the Siberiancoast, and that what are now the New Siberian Islands are shown as an area ofdry land.Hapgood was, of course, quite certain that portolans such as the Hadji Ahmad mapwere based on far earlier maps that date back to a long-forgotten civilisationof ‘ancient sea kings’ – in fact, to Atlantis. Robert Temple disagrees, and inthe 1998 edition of The Sirius Mystery puts forward his own interestingtheory.13 He accepts that ancient maps of Antarctica – such as the Piri Reismap, the Oronteus Finnaeus map, the Philip Buache map – show an Antarcticawithout ice, but he argues that they were not made by Antarcticans’ (i.e.,Atlanteans). His own view is that the maps are ‘survivals of knowledge left byvisiting extraterrestrials who were able to detect the true continental outlineof Antarctica through the ice’ from their orbiting spacecraft.Rand has pointed out the objection to this theory. If Temple’s spacemen surveyedAntarctica when it was under its present sheet of ice (say 600 BC), why didtheir survey (in the Hadji Ahmad map) show no gap between Asia and Alaska?Surely the most logical answer is that the maps were made when Lesser Antarcticaand Beringia were free of ice?Rand has here drawn attention to an important fact that Hapgood preferred toleave unstated. A map that seems to show Asia and Alaska joined together musthave been made long before Hapgood’s ‘worldwide maritime civilisation’ of 7,000BC; it would need to have been drawn around 12,000 BC or earlier. In otherwords, Hapgood is implying that at least some of the portolans originated beforethe ‘catastrophe’ that Plato speaks of.The quest of this book begins, in effect, in 1966, when Hapgood concluded Mapsof the Ancient Sea Kings by stating that the portolans established that theremust have been a worldwide maritime civilisation in 7,000 BC. If there was aworldwide civilisation 9,000 years ago, then it must have had origins that goback at least some time before that.We know that Hapgood was keeping something back: his belief that Plato’sAtlantis was a true story, and that therefore a maritime civilisation hadexisted since well before 10,000 BC. This notion accords with the views of NeilSteede and Oswaldo Rivera, the Director of Bolivian Archaeology, thatTiahuanaco may be as much as 12,000 years old. (Steede has since revised hisestimate downward to 9,000 BC – which would be, of course, after the flood.)We may also recall Robert Bauval’s view that the ancient Egyptians regarded theNile as a reflection of the Milky Way, and placed the pyramids accordingly. Andin The Sacred Valley of the Incas: Myths and Symbols, Fernando Salazar explainsin detail how the valley of the Vilcanota River, which includes Machu Picchu andOllentaytambo, was carefully landscaped to reflect the Milky Way, and that theastronomical knowledge encoded in it extends back to the building of Tiahuanaco.Whenever we look into the distant past, we seem to discover that ancient peoplespossessed a sophisticated astronomy.Rand’s Atlantis blueprint – particularly the fact that a series of Americansites are linked to a Giza prime meridian – carries Hapgood’s argument one stepfurther. If Tiahuanaco was built – as Steede now believes – around 9,000 BC,then we must suppose the Giza meridian was also in use at that time. It is, infact, Rand’s view that the Giza meridian must be ‘post-flood’ because all themeridians link to the North Pole.Rand’s blueprint obviously goes further than Hapgood for, if he is correct,Tiahuanaco was only one of a worldwide web of religious sites. It also seems toemerge that whoever did the ‘siting’ was aware of the earlier crust movementsthat preceded the Hudson Bay Pole. Rand’s blueprint shows that many sites can bealigned on the two earlier poles, suggesting some tradition that extends back atleast 100,000 years.Let me try to give an overall picture of the theory that is beginning to emerge.The notion that our ancestors were ignorant cavemen is a misconception – theywere far more intelligent than we give them credit for. Our mistake lies inidentifying intelligence with the left brain. There is a deeper, more intuitivekind of intelligence, which is almost beyond our comprehension.Compared to the intelligence of early man, the intelligence of modern man islike a microscope compared to a telescope. Modern man narrows his senses tostudy minutiae. Our remote ancestors widened their perceptions to try tounderstand the cosmos. This explains, for example, why the precession of theequinoxes has been known for hundreds of generations.Enormous and catastrophic crust movements also gave ancient man an urgent reasonfor studying the earth under his feet. A fairly simple ‘predicter’ built ofposts, a ‘Uriel’s machine’, would have served his purpose.The ‘blueprint’ recognises that, while there are more than sixty sacred sitesrelated to the Hudson Bay Pole, there are eight that are related to the HudsonBay Pole and, at the same time, to the Yukon Pole: Byblos, Jericho, Nazca,Cuzco, Xi’an, Aguni, Pyongyang and Rosslyn Chapel.We believe that the ‘great catastrophe’ took place about 9,600 BC, and that theNorth Pole then moved to its present position. Which implies, of course, thatAtlantis (or whatever we choose to call this earlier civilisation) existed forsome time before 9,600 BC. H ow long before? It must surely have been a longtime, since the Atlanteans established more than sixty sacred sites all over theworld.Looking through the sacred sites, Rand noted that Avebury, Abydos and Nippurrepresented a special case. Most people are familiar with Avebury because it is‘next door’ to Stonehenge, but not all of us are aware of the significance ofNippur and Abydos.Nippur was the religious capital of the Sumerians and is where the epic ofGilgamesh was discovered at the end of the nineteenth century by the BabylonianExpedition from the University of Pennsylvania. Christian and Barbara JoyO’Brien, whom we met in Chapter 7, base much of their research on theirtranslation of the Kharsag Epic, another remarkable piece of Sumerian mythologydiscovered at the holy city of Nippur.The ‘Osireion’, a key building at Abydos (the birthplace of Osiris), wasdiscovered in 1903 and excavated in 1913–14.Like the Temple in front of the Great Sphinx, it was built using massive stones,many weighing 100 tons. Professor Naville, of the 1914 Egypt Exploration Fundthat undertook the excavation, wrote: ‘I should even say that we may call it themost ancient stone building in Egypt.’Like the eight sites listed above, Avebury, Abydos and Nippur were linked to theYukon Pole, but they were also, Rand observed, all slightly misaligned to theHudson Bay Pole.Was it possible, he wondered idly, that these three had been the ‘original’sacred sites? He had already told me he suspected that the time of the YukonPole was regarded by later generations as a kind of Golden Age, so it would benatural that the original ‘markers’ should have been related to it.He had another reason for believing these three sites to be unique. When hestudied their latitudes, he realised they were all one degree ‘out’ whencompared with the other seven earlier sites mentioned above. According to Rand’scalculation, for example, in order to match the pattern of the other sevensites, Avebury should have been at 45 degrees north, but was actually at 46.Abydos and Nippur should both have been at 10, but were actually at 11.Supposing that, during the time when Avebury, Abydos and Nippur were the onlysacred sites, something extraordinary happened; some cosmic event, like a closeencounter with a comet, that caused a one-degree shift in the earth’s crust. Wemust bear in mind that one degree on the surface of the earth is about seventymiles. And if it happened fairly quickly, the result must have been fairlytraumatic – although, of course, nothing like the 30-degree slide of 9,600 BC.Such an ‘earlier shift’, which Rand refers to as the ‘X-event’, could explainwhy Avebury, Abydos and Nippur were misaligned by one degree. The X-event wouldhave acted, as he put it, as a ‘kick in the ass’, and sixty-six more‘catastrophe-predictors’ were hastily established to supplement the initialthree at Avebury, Abydos and Nippur. I asked Rand: ‘When do you think thisX-event occurred?’ His answer was: ‘I don’t know. All I know is that it wasbefore 9,600 BC ’Without a date and physical evidence to substantiate the X-event, Rand admitsthat this idea of ‘early-warning’ bases must remain pure speculation. But hepoints out that Enoch seemed to have foreknowledge of the coming flood when hespoke to Noah. That knowledge could plausibly have come from changes in theposition of Avebury, Abydos and/or Nippur following a one-degree‘mini-displacement’.Rand also believes that his blueprint theory can find the lost city of Atlantis.In the second half of the 1980s the study of ‘mitochondrial DNA’ (DNA inheritedonly from females) led to the discovery that modern humans all sprang from one‘mitochondrial Eve’ about 200,000 years ago. The footprints of an anatomicallymodern woman were discovered in South Africa in 1997; she had walked across theLangebaan Lagoon 117,000 years ago. In short, there is now a consensus thatmodern humans emerged before 100,000 years ago.[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_027_r1.jpg]100,000 years ago the Arctic Circle was centred upon the Yukon Pole.The usual date given for the emergence of Cromagnons is about 40,000 years ago,when they appeared in Europe. Where were they between 100,000 years and 40,000years ago?Rand’s suggested answer is Lesser Antarctica. According to Hapgood’s The Path tothe Pole, the North Pole was in the Yukon 100,000 years ago. Note that theAntarctic Circle extended towards southern Africa where, we know, the remains ofanatomically modern humans were found. The presence there of seashells, alongwith the human fossils dating to 92,000 years ago, means our ancestors knew howto exploit the ocean from an early date. But how could they have travelled fromsouthern Africa to South America and Antarctica?Thor Heyerdahl demonstrated that the ocean currents act as silent conveyorbelts, like the moving sidewalks in airports. If modern humans were exploitingsea resources on the shores of South Africa during the Yukon Pole, then it isentirely predictable what would happen to them when — as was bound to[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_028_r1.jpg]100,000 years ago, the ocean currents in the South Atlantic would have carriedpeople from South Africa to America and Lesser Antarctica[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_029_r1.jpg]The ‘Atlantis Channel’ separated mainland Antarctica from the islands lyingtowards South America.happen – some were swept out to sea. We know that Japanese sailors made theirway across the wider Pacific Ocean, landing in California and eventually findingtheir way to Arizona.14 In 1999 fossils discovered in Brazil proved to belong toan Australian Aborigine.15Ocean currents in the southern hemisphere move in a counter-clockwise direction.The following map shows the ocean and wind patterns prior to 91,600 BC: Peopleon boats or rafts could have been carried from South Africa, up the west coastof the continent, and across the South Atlantic, to Brazil or Argentina – and tothe ice-free regions of Lesser Antarctica. At this time there would have been achannel between the mainland and Antarctica’s chain of islands, which Rand callsthe ‘Atlantis Channel’. This would have had an impact upon the ocean and windcurrents because it would have allowed passage into the Pacific side of LesserAntarctica.Now we have a scenario whereby modern humans were transported by ocean currentsto Lesser Antarctica before the crust displacement of 91,600 years ago. With theGreenland displacement of 50,600 years ago, humans suddenly reappeared inAfrica, Asia and Australia. After each displacement, people spread across theworld, which may not be a coincidence. Around 91,600 BC, after a crustdisplacement, we find the fossil remains of humans in South Africa. The 50,600BC displacement brought a sudden influx of people into Asia and even Australia.With the last displacement of 9,600 BC a flood of humans arrived in both Northand South America, as well as (if Schwaller de Lubicz is right) Egypt. The lastwave of refugees carried rich tales of a lost island paradise in the south thatwas destroyed by a flood.Is it not possible, Rand asks, that modern humans evolved on Lesser Antarcticaduring the 40,000 years of silence in the fossil record? If so, then we shouldfind there the remains of modern humans dating back 50,000 or possibly 125,000years or more.Lomas and Knight have constructed ‘Uriel’s machine’ for studying the heavens,and they also deduced, from the words of the prophet Enoch, at what latitude themachine must have been located in ‘paradise’. Their analysis of this data shows,they believe, that Enoch was taken to a place between the range of latitudes 51and 59 degrees north.16 They rule out the southern hemisphere because ‘the firstthing we could be reasonably certain of was that his latitude must be north ofthe equator, because the only land at these latitudes to the south would placehim in Chile, Argentina, Tasmania or New Zealand, which all seemed equallyimprobable’.17Rand points out that there would have been plenty of inhabitable land on LesserAntarctica that would fall within these latitudes.The authors settle on latitude 55 degrees north, which takes them to Scotlandand, of course, Rosslyn Chapel. There is an unusual astronomical fact about 55degrees that captures their imagination: ‘We found it very interesting that therising points of the sun at the summer solstice and winter solstice form aperfect right-angle at the latitude of 55 degrees North, forming a “squareyear”.’18In this book we have noted that 55 degrees, 37 minutes north is a phi distancefrom the equator to the North Pole. Rand suggests that Lomas and Knight havefound the correct latitude at which Enoch saw Uriel’s machine, but Rand arguesthat it was on Lesser Antarctica, and that the original device may date backalmost 100,000 years. (And if this assertion seems breath-taking, bear in mindthat Uriel’s machine is actually a simple arrangement of posts or standingstones for studying the heavens, and that this book has tried to demonstratethat ancient man has been studying the stars for tens of thousands of years.)Rand says:In November 1999 Rose showed me a journal article called Active volcanismbeneath the West Antarctic ice sheet and the implications for ice-sheetstability’.19 She thought I might be interested because of my concern for thesafety of the Lesser Antarctic ice sheet. The article spoke of possiblevolcanoes under the ice which were undermining the stability of the ice sheet.Then I came to the following words: ‘Strikingly circular features in the Landsatimages from ice stream E in West Antarctica might also be interpreted asvolcanic constructs.’ I was immediately alerted because this ‘strikinglycircular feature’ was near the coast along the Ross Sea. We know that Plato’scity of Atlantis was immense and circular in design and that it was carved froma small hill that stood on a plain near the ocean’s shore. All these details weoutlined in When the Sky Fell.20 Now it seemed we might have stumbled upon thecity of Atlantis by accident.The authors of the article wrote: ‘This depression is underlain by a peak in thesubglacial topography that is associated with a unique magnetic signature’ andbrought to my mind that one of the features of Plato’s Atlantis was encirclingmetal walls.The authors offered the location of the ‘volcano’: ‘Located northwest of theWhitmore Mountains (81:52:05 S, 111:18:10 W), this feature is near the proposedsouthern flank of the rift system, and is 100–200 km east and inslope of theinitiation of ice streaming. The subglacial peak, which is 6 km wide at thebase, rises 650 m above the surrounding topography to within 1,400 m of the icesurface.’21Here, Rand points out, we have mountains, a rising hill on a plain and evenpossibly Plato’s hot springs that could be the source of the ‘initiation of icestreaming’.The location of the satellite image turns out to be at 55 degrees 15 minutessouth during the Yukon Pole, between Lomas and Knight’s ideal of 55 degrees andthe blueprint Golden Section latitude of 55 degrees, 37 minutes. Is the‘strikingly circular’ structure beneath 1,400 metres of ice in Lesser Antarcticathe lost city of Atlantis? The search for the lost city is a quest that has beenabandoned. But the Atlantis blueprint offers a key to unlock this possible site.Like Rennes-le-Château, Nanking, Rosslyn Chapel and the ‘pyramid’ off the watersof Yonaguni, the ringed structures glimpsed beneath the ice of Antarctica arelinked by a phi latitude to the Yukon Pole. Was the city constructed, tens ofthousands of years later, to commemorate the first settlement of those early menon Antarctica?Is there a lost city beneath the ice of Antarctica?"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 1BLUEPRINTS FROM ATLANTISRand Flem-AthIn November of 1993 I received a fax from John Anthony West that started me on afour-year quest. The article that slipped through the fax machine that day hadbeen written by an Egyptian-born construction engineer by the name of RobertBauval. Little did I suspect that Bauval would soon become known for hisrevolutionary theory that the pyramids of Egypt were a mirror image of theconstellation of Orion (see The Orion Mystery). However, in the article I readthat day Robert had taken his idea even further. He revealed that not only thepyramids but also that most famous of all sculptures, the Sphinx, was orientatedto the constellation of Orion as it appeared in 10,500 BC (see The Message ofthe Sphinx).John followed up his fax with a telephone call — one of our earliestconversations. He had read the original manuscript of our book When the Sky Fell(see website at www.flem-ath.com) and had volunteered to write an Afterword. Ourtheory that Antarctica could hold the remains of Atlantis was framed by theconcept of a geological phenomenon known as earth crust displacement about whichI had spent years corresponding with Charles Hapgood. I had concluded, based onextensive research into the origins of agriculture and the late Pleistoceneextinctions, that 9,600 BC was the most probable date of the last displacement.After discussing details about the Afterword for When the Sky Fell, John, in hisusual direct manner, asked me: ‘If Bauval is right that the Sphinx points to adate of 10,500 BC how do you reconcile that date with your time period of 9,600BC for the last displacement of the earth’s crust?’John had put his finger on a very important point. If the Sphinx had been builtbefore the crustal displacement, as Bauval’s data indicated, then the monument’sorientation would have been changed as the earth’s crust shifted, resulting in amisalignment. But the fact remains that the Sphinx – indeed the whole Gizacomplex – is precisely aligned with the earth’s cardinal points. ‘EitherBauval’s calculations of the astroarchaeology are incorrect or your date of9,600 BC is wrong,’ John said. ‘How sure are you of that date? Could you bewrong by 900 years?’‘John,’ I replied, ‘a host of archaeological and geological radiocarbon datesindicate unequivocally that the last catastrophe occurred in 9,600 BC. I’msticking with that. Perhaps the ancient Egyptians were memorialising an earlierdate that was tremendously significant to them, not necessarily the date thatthe Sphinx was carved.’In October of 1996 Robert Bauval and I continued the friendly debate at aconference in Boulder, Colorado. I was convinced that the Sphinx was constructedimmediately after 9,600 BC and explained why. ‘Imagine,’ I began, ‘that anasteroid or giant comet hit the United States today, utterly destroying theentire continent and throwing the whole culture back to the most primitive ofliving conditions. Then imagine that a team of scientists, perhaps safely underthe ocean in a submarine, survived the cataclysm and decided to commemoratetheir nation and leave a message for the future by constructing a monumentaligned to the heavens. What date would they choose to mark the memory of theUnited States of America? Would it be 1996, the year that their world ended? Idon’t think so. I believe that they would orientate their monument to 1776 – thedate that the nation was born. And, in the same way, I think that although theSphinx was created around 9,600 BC it is orientated to 10,500 BC because thatdate was significant to their culture.’Now it happens that inconsistencies and puzzles in science are like oxygen to myblood! My entire philosophy of science is predicated on the motto that anomaliesare gateways to discovery. I usually conduct my research in a methodical andpainstaking (some might say obsessive!) manner. However, over the past twentyyears of investigating the problem of Atlantis and the earth’s shifting crust Ihave discovered again and again that chance plays a critical role in discovery.Between writing novels, Rose works part-time at the local university library andher serendipitous approach to research ideally balances my own meticulousmethods. I can’t begin to count the number of times that she has brought home abook that turned out to be exactly what I needed. So when she presented me withArchaeoastronomy in Pre-Columbian America I eagerly flipped it open.Written in 1975 by Dr Anthony F. Aveni, one of the leading astroarchaeologistsin the world, the book dropped a critical piece of the puzzle that I was tryingto solve right into my lap. It appears that almost all of the major megalithicmonuments of Meso-America are oriented east of true north. Aveni wrote that thepeople of Meso-America did ‘tend to lay out many of their cities… orientedslightly east of true north… Fifty of the fifty-six sites examined align east ofnorth.’However, I found Aveni’s explanation for this alignment wanting. He believesthat the ‘Street of the Dead’, the famous avenue at Teotihuacan (near MexicoCity) is the key to the whole mystery of why the monuments are strangelymisaligned. This street, which runs directly toward the Pyramid of the Moon, ismisaligned 15.5 degrees east of north. Because it points within one degree tothe Pleiades constellation (a set of stars important to Meso-American mythology)Aveni views this skewed alignment as a kind of template, a master plan, for therest of the megaliths throughout Meso-America. While this is true forTeotihuacan’s Street of the Dead it is not true for the other sites that Avenilists in his book. His argument that the other forty-nine sites are merelyinadequate copies of the holy alignment of Teotihuacan rang hollow.I had a different idea. A theory based on the science of geodesy, the study ofthe measurement of the shape and size of the earth.In addition to astronomical observatories, what if these Mesoamerican sites werealso part of a vast geographical survey? My study of ancient maps had convincedme that the Atlanteans had mapped the world. What if the orientations of themost ancient cities of Mexico were remnants of a lost science – the science ofgeography? What if the alignment of the ancient cities were a stone stencil – aprecise blueprint of a pre-deluge earth?Teotihuacan lies upon the longitude of 98 degrees, 53 minutes west. If wesubtract the 15 degrees by which it is ‘misaligned’ we get a location of 83degrees, 25 minutes west – less than half a degree off Charles Hapgood’slocation of the North Pole prior to 9,600 BC.In other words, the Street of the Dead was 15.5 degrees west of the longitudethat Hapgood had calibrated for the old pole.When I made this discovery I was naturally very excited. Could it be that theancient monuments of Mexico were orientated to the pole before the last earthcrust displacement? The implications were profound. Such an orientation wouldpoint to the existence of a civilisation which must have held scientificknowledge of the earth’s geography. They also must have possessed sophisticatedsurveying methods that they put to use in America before the earth’s crustshifted.I soon discovered that several important Meso-American sites (Tula, Tenayucan,Copan and Xochicalco, for instance) matched my geodetic theory. Each of theirmisalignments when subtracted from their current longitude yielded the longitudeof the North Pole before the last earth crust displacement (83 degrees west).What if, I wondered, there were other sites in the Old World that wereorientated to the old pole?I began to research sites in Iraq, cradle of the most ancient civilisations.Unlike Meso-America, these sites had not been studied in relation to theirmisalignment to the earth’s cardinal points. I had to piece together theevidence from site to site, from author to author. But the tedious task wasworth it to obtain the startling result. I soon discovered that many of theoldest sites in the Middle East are west of today’s North Pole. Like the ancientsites of Meso-America they were orientated to the old pole.The ancient city of Ur, its ziggurat (a stepped pyramid symbolising a sacredmountain) and its shrine to the moon god Nanna are orientated west of north(towards the ‘old pole’ in the Hudson Bay).Without control of the holy city of Nippur no ruler could rightfully claim to bethe King of Sumeria. The remains of the city lie south of Baghdad where some ofthe most famous tablets in archaeology were unearthed at the turn of century.The tablets disclosed the Sumerian belief in the existence of a long-lost islandparadise called Dilmun. The myth of Dilmun, which we show in When the Sky Fellis remarkably similar to the mythology of the Haida people of British Columbia,relates how the island paradise is destroyed by the god, Enlil, in a greatflood. Enlil’s incredible power is honoured at Nippur with a temple and aziggurat which is skewed west of north.The ziggurat and ‘White Temple’ of the Sumerian city of Uruk also point toHudson Bay rather than true north. The more I looked, the more ancient sites Ifound in the Middle East that pointed to the North Pole before the last earthcrust displacement. Perhaps the most poignant is Jerusalem’s ‘Wailing Wall’, theonly remains of Herod’s Temple, built upon the site of Solomon’s Temple.I now knew that I was looking at a unique geodetic phenomenon that demandedexploration. My next step was to calculate the former latitudes of the keymegalithic and sacred sites of the world. If the latitudes were located atsignificant numbers then I could be sure that I really was on to something.The first site I measured was, of course, the eternally compelling Great Pyramidat Giza. I calculated its co-ordinates against 60 degrees north, 83 degrees west(the Hudson Bay Pole). Giza had been 4,524 nautical miles from the Hudson BayPole, which meant its latitude was at 15 degrees north prior to 9,600 BC. Ifound it odd that Giza, which today lies at 30 degrees north (one-third of thedistance from the equator to the Pole), should have been so neatly at 15 degreesnorth (one-sixth the distance) before the last earth crust displacement. So Idecided to study Lhasa, the religious centre of Tibet, because I knew that thiscity, like Giza, lies at 30 degrees north today.Lhasa’s co-ordinates are 29 degrees 41 minutes north, 91 degrees 10 minuteseast, which calculated at 5,427 nautical miles from the Hudson Bay Pole. Thedistance from the equator to the pole is 5,400 nautical miles (90 degrees times60 seconds = 5,400), so Lhasa had rested just 27 nautical miles (less than halfa degree) off the equator during the reign of Atlantis. This was getting spooky.The earth crust displacement had shoved Giza from 15 degrees to 30 degrees whilemoving Lhasa from 0 degrees to 30 degrees. Was this coincidence?The coincidence started to become extreme when I compared the location of Gizaand Lhasa (and a host of other ancient sites) with the position of the crustover three earth crust displacements. I was amazed to discover that latitudeslike 0 degrees, 12 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees came up again andagain. Each of these numbers divides the earth’s geography by whole numbers.This seemed way beyond chance so I christened them ‘sacred latitudes’. Most ofthese sites will be familiar to anyone who takes an interest in archaeology orthe sacred sites of the world’s major religions. All of these places are within30 nautical miles (a day’s walk) of sacred latitudes and are thus moreaccurately aligned geodetically than Aveni’s astronomical calculations.Sacred latitudes when the Pole was at Hudson Bay (60 degrees north, 83 degreeswest) * 0º Lhasa, Aguni, Mohenjo-Daro, Easter Island * 5º Byblos, Xi’an * 10º Ur/Uruk/Eridu, Thebes/Luxor, Ise, Susa * 12º Babylon, Pyongyang * 15º Giza Pyramids, Jericho/Jerusalem, Ashur, Nazca * 30º Carthage, Quito * 45º Copan, Marden * Note: Cities connected by ‘/’ are located so close together that they yield the same results.Sacred latitudes when the Pole was at the Greenland Sea (73 degrees north, 10degrees east) * 0º Quito * 10º Cuzco/Machu Picchu/Ollantaytambo * 12º Angkor * 30º Xi’an, Pyongyang * 45º Giza Pyramids, Nippur, Dahshur, SaqqaraSacred latitudes when the Pole was in the Yukon (63 degrees north, 135 degreeswest) * 0º Byblos, Machu Picchu/Cuzco/Ollantaytambo, Nazca, Abydos * 5º Tiahuanaco, Jericho/Jerusalem, Nippur, Babylon, Susa * 10º Rhodes (Knossos, on the island of Crete, is off by 41 nautical miles) * 12º Gozo (Malta) * 15º Lalibala * 20º Xi’an, Aguni * 30º Avebury/Stonehenge, Glastonbury, PyongyangThe careful reader will note that several of these sites show up in more thanone table. They are actually situated at the crossing points of two (even three)sacred latitudes. For example, Giza lies at the intersection of 15 degrees(Hudson Bay Pole) and 45 degrees north (Greenland Sea Pole) and today is at 30degrees north. Lhasa, which today is near 30 degrees north, was at the equatorduring the Hudson Bay Pole and only 32 nautical miles from 30 degrees northduring the Greenland Sea Pole.Other sacred interconnections include:Byblos (0º and 5º) The most sacred city of the Phoenicians. Machu Picchu/ Amountain-based ark in the high Andes Cuzco (0º and 10º) and the holiest city ofthe Incas. Nazca (0º and 15º) Gigantic drawings visible only from the air. Aguni(0º and 20º) Underwater ‘wall’ off Japan’s island of Okinawa. Quito (30º and 0º)Equatorial city at the north end of the Inca Trail. Pyongyang (30º and 30º and12º) Capital of North Korea.

Babylon (5º and 12º) Site of the famous ‘hanging gardens’,one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Known for astronomy and astrology.So what was going on here?I believe that sometime before the devastating earth crust displacement,scientists in Atlantis recognised that the increasing earthquakes and risingocean level that they were experiencing were a warning of a coming geologicalcatastrophe. Trying to preserve their civilisation from this unavoidabledisaster, they became obsessed with discovering exactly what had overtaken theglobe in the remote past.Teams of geologists fanned across the planet with a mission to gauge the formerpositions of the earth’s crust. If they could determine exactly how far thecrust had shifted in the past they might have some idea of what they couldexpect to face in the future. In the process of their investigations they leftgeodetic markers at the points they considered critical to their calculations.After the earth crust displacement that destroyed Atlantis, the old calibrationswere rediscovered by survivors who knew nothing of that forgotten and desperategeographic survey. They naturally believed that these marvellous geodeticmarkers from those who had gone before were messages from the gods. The sitesbecame sacred – cities were built around them (it’s no accident that‘Teotihuacan’ is an Aztec term for ‘Place of the Gods’) and their very practicalpurpose was lost.Further generations continued to worship at these huge shrines but eventuallythe winds of time began to erode the original structures. New altars were builton top of the remnants of the artifacts left by the surveyors from Atlantis. Butduring each reconstruction whispers from the past compelled the new architectsto preserve the original orientations – orientations that pointed to the HudsonBay Pole – to the time when Atlantis thrived.The secrets buried beneath the slowly crumbling cities remained hidden forthousands of years. Eventually some intrepid souls in Egypt, Mesopotamia, India,China and America had the courage to begin excavations. The story of theremarkable discoveries uncovered by those who dared to dig under holy sites isonly now emerging. The secret mission of the Knights Templar in Jerusalem is butone of these fascinating accounts.I believe we can explain the enigmatic location of the ancient megaliths in away that finally makes sense of their puzzling misalignments. These sacredsites, which we sense contain clues to our true history, continue to drawvisitors who marvel over their awesome construction feats and wonder at theintelligence and vision of our anonymous ancestors. But my explanation coversonly the tip of a very deep iceberg. There are many more sites that can bediscovered using simple calculations derived from latitude changes after crustaldisplacements: not the least of which are sites on Atlantis itself, the islandcontinent of Antarctica.I never thought to find another adventure to compare with my eighteen-yearsearch for Atlantis. But the unique placement of the earth’s most sacred siteshas emerged as a mystery that compels me with the same kind of fascination asthat journey did. I hope to share this quest within the pages of a new book,Finding the Future: Blueprints from Atlantis (original working title), whichwill lift the veil from these ancient sites to reveal concealed time capsules –messages, records, and even blueprints – from Atlantis."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 2LETTER TO RAND FLEM-ATH FROM CHARLES H. HAPGOOD, 16 OCTOBER 1982Hapgood was living at 103 Davis Street (rear) in Greenfield, Massachusetts,01301, while Rand and Rose were living at Flat 9, 9 Eldon Grove, London NW3.I seem to have misunderstood you. The Path of the Pole is the second edition ofEarth’s Shifting Crust. I am working on the third edition now, and hope it willbe published next year. The first edition is unobtainable, and I was flatteredto learn its is [sic] a collector’s item selling for about $100.00. However, Iget no financial benefit, from that.From the edition you have, no doubt you have realized that the way crustdisplacement affects evolution is that it is an accelerating factor. It opensnew habitats, it clears ecological niches, it increases selection pressure.Biologists have recognized that climatic change is the leading factor inevolution and a few have realized that crust displacement at relatively shortintervals provides that factor. It is unnecessary to have recourse to reconditefactors to explain evolution. In some cases particular forms of life haveendured for hundreds of millions of years without change. Look at the coelcanth,at the Komodo dragon lizard. There is no reason for it: it is just accident. Andspecies don’t change unless they have to, and they don’t die out withoutspecific cause.I believe that a displacement, once started, will continue until the mass ofequilibrium is balanced. It then stops and a new movement awaits the developmentof another imbalance creating another centrifugal effect. The new movement willbe in a direction unrelated to the last one; moreover there is no predetermineddistance for the crust to travel. That is determined by the quantity of thecentrifugal momentum acting on the crust in each case.From examining hundreds of myths of earth upheaval I am convinced of one simpletruth, that in the main they are not myths, not psychological developments, butaccounts of real events, elaborated just as any event not accounted for will beaccounted for by ad hoc rationalizing. Most of the catastrophe myths (forexample, about Atlantis) don’t bring in supernaturalism. I have recentlyconcluded that a ‘drag effect’ would operate whereby the movement of the rigidcrust would set in motion movements of the deeper layers, which would continuelong after the movement of the crust stops, producing long-continued turbulenceat the surface. Though the movement of the crust is slow there would be plentyof violent episodes, enough for any catastrophist. I think another movement hasstarted; unfortunately for another ice age, starting several thousand years fromnow. A movement of the whole crust is what creates the plates and powers alltheir movements originally, though their movements continue long afterwards.Your article in the Anthropological Journal offers some good topics fordiscussion. I hope you don’t mind my making some suggestions. On page 4 you usethe phrasing, ‘shifting of various parts of the earth’s crust at differenttimes, over the earth’s axis’. I think it would be clearer for most people ifyou said ‘shifting of the entire earth’s crust as a unit over its semi-molteninterior’.In light of the theory of crustal displacement the western hemisphere is at adisadvantage because of geography. In the eastern hemisphere migration can occurin many different directions in accordance with the climatic changes. In theAmericas the opportunities for migration are much more limited. It is not safeto depend on considerations of elevation, because elevations can change greatlyin a displacement. For example, it is certain that the elevations of the Andeswere increased since agriculture was introduced. Thus we find agriculturalterraces at present above the line of eternal snow, and marine fauna in LakeTiticaca.Furthermore, there is evidence that the last displacement of the crust movedboth American continents southward about 30 degrees, and absolutely devastatedlife and civilization on them, while climatic change was much less drastic inthe Old World, and more avenues of escape existed. I have found evidence of theancient existence of agricultural cultures in the United States, in Mexico andin South America.Furthermore, in recent exciting discoveries I believe I have convincing evidenceof a whole cycle of civilization in America and in Antarctica,3 suggestingadvanced levels of science that may go back 100,000 years. I think setting anydate for the beginning of agriculture is premature, anywhere on earth.A good deal of the evidence I have on this will be included in the new editionof ESC.5Finally, I am sure you realize that I am not suggesting a sudden displacement ofthe crust.6 I think it would take at least four thousand years. There could bevery violent episodes during this time, such as the upheaval of the Andes musthave been: but not mountain-high tidal waves.Of course, another angle that must be carefully calculated is that in anydisplacement maximum movement of the crust would occur along a central meridianof travel, and movement on either side would be proportional to distance fromthis meridian, that is, to longitude, diminishing to zero at 90 from themeridian.One of your references has great interest to me: Langway and Hansen, 1973.9With best regards,Sincerely,Charles Hapgood"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3SACRED SITES LINKED TO THE UDSON BAY POLE (60 DEGREES NORTH, 83 DEGREES WEST)Rand Flem-AthThese sacred sites are all within half a degree (30 nautical miles) of theformer sacred latitude listed in the last column in the second table.

They believethat the US government possesses at least one flying saucer and has hiredexperts to try to understand the underlying science of the alien crafts. Thisprocess is called ‘back-engineering’. I’m not saying that a flying sauceractually exists, tucked in a secret hangar somewhere. Indeed, all my research isbased upon the assumption that the past can be understood without reference toaliens or UFOs. But I do think that the idea of ‘back-engineering’ isappropriate to our search for lost sacred sites.By back-engineering the Atlantis blueprint we can retrace the steps of thesurvivors of the flood. Hapgood’s Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings shows maps thatillustrate the shape of the continents and their positions before thedisplacement. Refugees from the deluge realised that to make use of thiscritical information they would have to update the latitudes that had beendramatically changed by the displacement. Giza, for instance, had moved from 15degrees north to 30 degrees north. By surveying the planet from key points suchas Giza, the survivors could overlay their accurate maps of the pre-flood worldon to the new latitudes. This took them to specific places – places thateventually became sacred sites to following generations.The Atlantis blueprint reveals several important sites (Copan, Quito, forexample) that are linked in three ways. First, they are linked by a significantmeasurement to the Giza prime meridian. Copan, for example is 120 degrees westof the Great Pyramid (WGP). Second, they are located at a sacred latitude (Copanis at 15 degrees north). And third, they were also located at a sacred latitudeduring the Hudson Bay Pole (HBP) (Copan was at 45 degrees north). Perhaps we canextrapolate from this knowledge to find other sacred places that have remainedhidden through time?One of the most intriguing lost sites suggested by the blueprint is at16:11S/58:52W on the border between Bolivia and Brazil, where Colonel Fawcettbelieved he had found the ruins of an Atlantean city. This site is promisingbecause it lies one-quarter the distance around the globe from the Giza primemeridian and shares its latitude with Tiahuanaco. It also follows the pattern ofRosslyn Chapel (50/50 site) and Canterbury (45/45 site) in being also located atan angle that lies at a 12/12 intersection of the current and former pole.Another site, in California, mirrors Fawcett’s lost Brazilian city. Theblueprint has led us to megalithic structures at 100, 110, 120, 130 and 140degrees west of the Great Pyramid (WGP), and that’s what led us to look forBrazilian sites at 90, 80 and 72 degrees WGP. If we look to the west and northwe find that the 150 degrees WGP measurement cuts through southern California.The most promising latitude is the Polar Golden Section (PGS) division at34:23N. The PGS denotes the latitude of Baalbek; Pyramid No. 6 in the Chineseprovince of Xi’an; Ehdin of the Kharsag epic; and one of the most sacred sitesin Japan, the Shinto Temple at Ise.During the Hudson Bay Pole, this same Californian site was located at 55:16N,which is less than half a degree from the perfect Equatorial Golden Section(EGS) latitude of 55:37N. So the mystery site in California was a double GoldenSection site, being at a PGS position today and an EGS position before theflood. And it is linked to the Great Pyramid at Giza. Moreover, Kilwinning(55:40N) and Rosslyn (55:52N) are near this latitude today. Before the flood theCalifornia site shared its latitude with a tiny island off the south coast ofFlorida called ‘North Bimini’ (55:41N during the HBP). North Bimini is a sitefavoured by Edgar Cayce for Atlantis. It is at 110 WGP, sharing that longitudewith the northern Inca capital of Quito.When I realised this I searched a map of California for a location that was at150 WGP at the Golden Section latitude of 34:23N. The closest city was called‘Ojai’.I had never heard of it.I’ve since discovered that Ojai (pronounced Oh-Hi) was immortalised in FrankCapra’s classic 1937 film Lost Horizon. Capra needed the most beautiful settingthat he could find to represent ‘Shangri-La’, the lost Tibetan city. In choosingOjai for the site of his lost paradise, Capra was following in the footsteps ofothers who believed that the Ojai Valley was sacred. The Chumash people, whooccupied large parts of southern California before the arrival of the white man,considered the Ojai Valley to be sacred. They called it the ‘Valley of theMoon’, and believed that it was ‘an entry point into the land of the spirits’.As time went by Ojai became increasingly associated with spiritualism.One of the most fascinating philosophers of the twentieth century was closelylinked to the city. Born in India in May 1895, when he was eleven years old hewas ‘discovered’ by a member of the Theosophical Society, who brought the boy tothe attention of Annie Besant, a well-known leader of the Theosophical Society.She brought the boy to England and educated him there. His name was JisshuKrishnamurti and he became a spokesperson for a radical free school of thoughtthat advocated eliminating eventually all organised religion. His motto became‘Truth is a pathless land’.In 1922, Krishnamurti made a visit to Ojai and fell in love with the valley,making it his life-long home. In an interview published in the Ojai Valley News,Krishnamurti said, ‘The feeling you have is of a sacred place…’ And ‘in India,in Greece and other civilizations, when they find a beautiful spot like this,they put up a temple’.Although there are no megalithic structures here, Ojai joins a select number ofsites around the world that are linked by Golden Section divisions of theearth’s dimensions (see table opposite).Golden Section latitudes today, during the Hudson Bay Pole and during the YukonPole* = Giza Prime Meridian Site** = City of Atlantis (see Chapter 10)[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_035_r1.jpg]Lost sacred sites linked simultaneously to the Giza prime meridian (GPM), thecurrent and the former position of the earth’s crust/mantle* EGS = Equatorial Golden Section or 55:37N** 10 phi = 10 phi or 16:11N[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_036_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 6SPENDING TIME AND WASTING SPACE: HOW ICE CORE DATING WENT WRONGRand Flem-AthImagine that you have just returned from a visit to Disney World in Floridawhere you purchased a ticket in the state lottery. You get a phone call and aretold that you have won $3,000,000! Your life has just changed. But wait, thereis a problem. When you go to collect they tell you that the real figure is$400,000. Okay – it’s a disappointment, but you really can’t be too sad. Finallythe cheque arrives in the mail and it reads $122,000. What would your reactionbe? Wouldn’t you want to investigate?I tell this brief story for a serious purpose. Over the past couple of years‘experts’ in ice core dating have claimed that the ice sheet on LesserAntarctica is at least 3,000,000,1 or 400,000,2 or 122,0003 years old, andtherefore the theory of earth crust displacement has been falsified. Peoplecould never have lived in Lesser Antarctica a mere 12,000 years ago. But whichdate is the correct one? Something is very wrong here.To find out what it is we must begin with a basic logical tool discovered by theGreek philosopher Pythagoras (circa 600 BC). He is generally regarded as thefirst European to claim that the earth is round and that it can be divided intoclimatic zones (polar, temperate and equatorial). He also introduced the notionof ‘antipodes’ – that people could live on the opposite side of the earth. TheGreek word for ‘feet’ is ‘pode’ and so Pythagoras called land in the southernhemisphere antipodes because the feet of the people living there were pointingin a direction that was counter to the northern hemisphere. ‘Antipodes’ means‘counter-footed’. This notion of antipodes is a fundamental logical tool forevaluating the reliability of the ice dating method.Geologists almost never tire of repeating the phrase first coined by JamesHutton that ‘the present is the key to the past’. It remains a central conceptin geology. If we wish to understand the past we must first understand thepresent. This is good advice and provided we remember that rates of change canvary without violating physical laws, it is advice that we need to takeseriously. Today we do not find ice sheets accumulating in temperate zones(except in mountain ranges), nor do we find temperate-adapted animals living inpolar zones. What we find instead is ice accumulating at the poles and only asmall range of polar-adapted animals living within the polar zones.When we look at Lesser Antarctica through the lens of ice core dating we get oneset of ‘facts’, but when we compare these results with the evidence of theantipodes to Lesser Antarctica then other, contradictory facts emerge. What wefind from the ice core dating is that Lesser Antarctica has been covered in icefor at least 122,000 years, if not more. But when we shift our attention to theopposite side of the globe and look at Siberia, Beringia and Alaska, we do notfind equivalent ice sheets. Instead we find evidence of many large mammals suchas horses, bison and rhinoceros swarming over grasslands. How can one part ofthe globe be under ice for at least 122,000 years while the exact opposite ofthe globe has no ice and large mammals (dating from 11,000 to 70,000 carbon-14years ago)? This does not compute. Either the evidence from the north is wrong,or the evidence from the south is wrong.What the ‘ice core experts’ are proposing is something for which we have noexperience in the present: they claim that at one time, one side of the globewas under ice, while simultaneously, on the exact opposite side of the globe,large mammals were roaming on ice-free grasslands. Where on earth today can wefind such a combination? We can’t. If Siberia/Beringia/Alaska demonstratesevidence from a wide variety of dating methods and they all point to this areabeing much warmer before 9,600 BC, then we have every right to assume that thesame must have been the case on Lesser Antarctica. It is simple logic as old asPythagoras.But the real problem that I have with those who cite ice core dating as thefinal word on the age of the Lesser Antarctic ice sheet is that these samepeople have nothing whatsoever to say about how the ice got there in the firstplace. They think that ice ages are simply about time and temperature changesand so they ignore the simple facts about where the ice formed and where it istoday. What explanation do they offer for the fact that central Greenland andGreater Antarctica, which together hold more than 90 per cent of the world’sice, are situated in polar deserts?The quest to solve the mystery of the ice ages has been one of the longestunsolved problems in science. Geology had been the darling of scientists in thenineteenth century, when giants such as James Hutton and Charles Lyell threwback the curtain of the earth’s past to reveal time scales that staggered thepublic’s imagination and shocked representatives of the Church. By challengingthe Church’s blind faith in the story of the flood and by stretching the timescale beyond the rigid confines of a world supposedly created in 4,004 BC, theuniformitarian geologists made a dramatic and lasting impact upon humanconsciousness.During this time there was no challenge like geology. It was science’s vanguard.Upon its foundations the likes of Charles Darwin built his radical theory ofevolution. These were geology’s heady days, but now the very science that oncechallenged the past with relentless observation and merciless logic has lost itsway.When Louis Agassiz first proposed the idea that the world had once experiencedan ice age, the geological establishment laughed. Today there is no doubt thatice sheets have covered huge tracts of Europe and more than half of NorthAmerica. But despite the fact that this theory is now entrenched in academichalls and is referred to daily by professors of geology, the actual cause of theice ages remains an unsolved mystery.Each year we are assured that this rather embarrassing state of affairs will berectified and geology will be rid of its most persistent problem. But no one hasyet been able to account for all the significant facts. When a problem such asthis persists it often requires an entirely new perspective to initiate change.We believe that the problem of the ice ages has remained such a thorn in theside of geologists because it has been misconceived ever since Lyell took itover from Agassiz and transformed it into a uniformitarian theory.Uniformitarianism is a research tradition in geology that continues to hold swaydespite the fact that its logical inconsistencies were exposed in 1965. In thatyear, Stephen Jay Gould wrote one of his earliest published papers, entitled ‘IsUniformitarianism Necessary?’. Gould applied logic to the problem and was ableto show that this idea was actually two ideas parading as one.The early uniformitarians, like Hutton and Lyell, argued that science must notrely upon the assumption that changes of the earth could be explained throughthe actions of supernatural forces. They put forward a very important principlethat became one of the key foundations of modern science: the idea that physicallaws are invariant. What this means is that the laws of gravity, the dynamics ofphysics, are constant in the universe and do not change through time or space.The principle of invariance became one of the pillars not only for geology butalso for science itself. It is an act of faith to believe that physical laws donot vary through time and space, but it is an act of faith that seems entirelyreasonable to most scientists. We also support this notion but the problemarises when the second of uniformitarianism’s dual ideas is brought into theequation.That is the notion of gradual change. This is a theory of the earth, not ageneral principle of science, but uniformitarians often didn’t appreciate thedistinction. For them, anyone who challenges the idea of gradual change mustalso be challenging the notion of the invariance of physical laws. By separatingthe geological theory of gradualism from the scientific principle of invariance,Gould showed that uniformitarianism was ill conceived from the outset. Hisargument can be summarised by saying that ‘invariance is true but gradualism isfalse’.We need to go back to 1837 when the ice ages were first proposed by Agassiz tosee how his idea was transformed into the uniformitarian theory that it istoday. This historical review can help us see how ice core dating is ultimatelyflawed.From the outset, Agassiz envisioned the ice ages as events that were suddenlythrust upon the earth:A sudden intense winter, that was to last for ages, fell upon our globe; itspread over the very countries where these tropical animals had their homes, andso suddenly did it come upon them that they were embalmed beneath masses of snowand ice, without time even for the decay which follows death.Agassiz believed that the ice ages fanned out from the North and South Poles andengulfed the globe. This raised a troublesome problem. If the overalltemperature of the earth had suddenly dropped, then how could the tropicalanimals have survived to the present day? Agassiz could not answer this questionwith logic, so he made a fatal error. He adopted the idea of ‘special creation’,which is the notion that after each catastrophic ice age God intervened in theprocess of evolution by repopulating the world with fresh tropical animals. Byaccepting the idea of ‘special creation’ Agassiz violated the prized principleof invariance.Science simply would not have it.And science was right.As time went on, Agassiz’s theory of sudden ice ages followed by specialcreations was replaced by Lyell’s slow, gradual ice ages, which simply ignoredthe problem of tropical animals. This proved to be the better tactic and as aresult Agassiz’s catastrophic theory was absorbed into uniformitarian geology.The problem of tropical animals is one that is still with us. And there is theequally troublesome problem of evaporation. In order to have snowfall you mustfirst have moisture in the air and this in turn is dependent upon evaporation inthe tropics. If the overall temperature of the earth falls with each ice agethen the tropics also should be cooler. But if the tropics are cooler then thismeans there is less evaporation, and less evaporation ultimately means lesssnowfall. The creation of ice sheets requires substantial evaporation in thetropics. So what we really need is a theory that can provide evaporation in thetropics at the same time as snow is accumulating as ice sheets. A mantledisplacement can explain these problems by replacing the simple presuppositionof stable latitudes with the notion of variable latitudes. By treating theclimatic zones (polar, temperate, tropical) as constants and the earth’s mantleas the variable, the issue of the survival of tropical animals and the problemof evaporation in the tropics, during so-called ice ages, is resolved.So why didn’t the tropical animals disappear? And how did the snow form in thefirst place if the tropics were cooler? These are two simple questions that havenever been properly answered by proponents of the theory that the ice ages arethe result of an overall drop in the earth’s temperature.The unsolved problem is the basic unit of science, yet geology continues toignore these two problems. For the past couple of decades scientists haverepeatedly relied upon ice core dating as a tool to gauge the temperaturechanges that they insist must have happened to cause the ice ages. But theirlogic is fundamentally flawed.The ice ages are not only about time and temperature.They are also about space. It is really rather shocking to note that in all thediscussion about the age of the ice sheets and the temperatures of the past,there is nothing said about where the ice sheets formed. It’s as if thisquestion has no bearing upon the problem. This is a ludicrous state of affairs.PhDs parading around the globe, attending conference after conference andpresenting ice core evidence, all ignore the simple fact that central Greenlandand eastern Antarctica, where over 90 per cent of the world’s ice resides, areboth polar deserts! It simply doesn’t snow where the ice is! This emperordefinitely has no clothes.Some have likened ice core dating to the rings of a tree that can be counted oneby one to arrive at a history of the past. There are similarities, but there arealso significant differences. As each new layer of ice is laid down it adds itsweight to those beneath. This does not happen with tree rings, which respond tolight. Ice cores are the result of falling snow. Light is a very regularfeature, unlike snowfall, which is unpredictable. The weight of each new layerof ice adds pressure to the layers beneath. This results in distortions andmelting of evidence. Ice at the bottom of the ice sheet is squeezed outwards anddisappears.The thickest ice sheet on Greenland is at 72N/38W, where the ice is almost 2miles deep. The cross-polar point from Greenland’s thickest ice sheet is72N/142E. The closest land is the New Siberian Islands (75N/140E). If we were toaccept that ice core dating from Greenland was a true indicator of temperatureworldwide, then the New Siberian Islands should also be under ice and couldnever have supported large mammals such as mammoths, lions, rhinos, bison andhorse.There is no logical reason whatsoever to prefer the ice core dating fromGreenland over the physical remains of extinct mammals from the New SiberianIslands as the criteria with which to estimate the[../Images/Wils_9780307481757_epub_037_r1.jpg]The thickest ice on Antarctica is antipodal to the thickest ice onGreenland. The cross-polar point to the thickest ice on Greenland is on the newSiberian Islands, which were formerly the home of a host of temperate-adaptedanimals. The antipodal point to the NewSiberian Islands is Lesser Antarctica, which would have enjoyed a temperateclimate 12,000 years ago.world’s temperature during the late Pleistocene. But this is exactly what theice core experts do. They assume that latitudes can change only very gradually.Sudden changes such as those envisioned with a mantel displacement are beyondtheir consideration. They say everything must be linked to what they find onGreenland. Russian scientists, however, have seen the remains of horses, bison,etc. in Siberia and they cannot accept that the American scientists’ methodologyis sound.And it isn’t.What the advocates of ice core dating have been doing is extrapolating datacollected on Greenland and Greater Antarctica to the rest of the world. Theyhave replaced investigation with extrapolation. They simply assume what they arelogically obliged to prove."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 7THE MECHANICS OF MANTLE DISPLACEMENTRand Flem-AthThe science journal Nature ran a cover story on 18 July 1996 called ‘Rotation ofthe inner core’. Hardly a bestseller, this report nevertheless can explain themost perplexing problem for the earth crust displacement theory.I first became aware of this problem just after Rose and I had done a publicitytour for the publication of When the Sky Fell. We had accepted an invitation togive a talk at the local bookstore in the small town of Ladysmith, BritishColumbia, where we live. After the talk and slide show we answered a fewquestions and then chatted with those still remaining. A man asked, ‘How wouldyour theory explain the hot spot under Hawaii?’After having answered literally thousands of questions about the theory this wasthe first time that I came across a question that baffled me. I said, ‘What doyou mean?’‘Well,’ he replied, ‘my impression was that the Hawaiian islands were formed bya hot spot beneath the crust. As the crust moves gradually over the hot spot therising magma pushes the crust upwards, forming islands. Since this has takenmillions of years to achieve it seems to contradict your idea that the crust asa whole displaces.’ I had to admit that this sounded reasonable and I said thatI would have to investigate the matter in more detail because his question wentstraight to the heart of the theory. It seemed to be an unfailing arrow.I did investigate the problem but it wasn’t until 1996 when the Nature articlecame out that I thought I might have an answer to this vexing question. In 1997,Arthur Logtenberg from Eindhoven, Holland, asked on our website for my ideas onthe Nature article, which had said that the heavy solid iron core of the earthwas rotating ‘100,000 times faster than the fastest relative motion of thetectonic plates of the lithosphere’. What this meant was that the inner core hadits own spin and axis that was only related to but not exactly the same as thespin and axis of the rest of the planet. It seemed to me that everything ‘above’the inner core was vulnerable to a displacement relative to the inner core. Icalled this idea a mantle displacement because the mantle is the thickest partof the earth above the inner core.This notion of a deeper level displacement offered a solution to the hot spotproblem. If the displacements were that much deeper, then it didn’t matter ifthere was a ‘hot spot’ beneath Hawaii, because it would move along with the restof the mass of the earth that was displacing over the inner core.In the summer of 1997 the question of the Hawaiian hot spot came up again. RickMonteverde of Honolulu asked, ‘Could it be that the entire globe simply shifted,interior as well as crust?’ I replied: ‘The Hawaiian island chain was producedby a “hot spot” beneath the surface of the crust. This poses a more seriousproblem for the earth crust displacement theory since a movement of the crustshould result in the hot spot showing up somewhere else beneath the earth’scrust. It is because of this problem that I have considered the movement of theentire mantle as a solution. A displacement of the earth’s mantle (somethingHapgood was considering when he wrote his last letter to me in October 1982 justweeks before he died in an automobile accident) is a much more satisfyingexplanation for the rapid changes and at the same time can account for themovement of the Hawaiian “hot spot” (it simply shifts along with the mantle).’But there was still the problem of what forces might have caused the mantledisplacement. In August 1997, Robert K. Morgan of San Diego asked, ‘What forceswould combine to break the earth’s crust free of the underlying mantle?’ Ireplied, ‘In When the Sky Fell (Chapter 4, “Why the Sky Fell”), we reviewHapgood’s adoption of the idea that the weight of the ice caps positionedlop-sided to the earth’s axis was one possible force. We also put forward twoastronomical factors as additional contributing forces to the displacement of9,600 BC. The earth’s orbit was much more elliptical than it is today and thusthe gravitational influence of the sun would “pull” with greater force at theimmense (antipodal) ice sheets. But perhaps most importantly, the angle of theearth’s tilt was at its extreme of 24.4 degrees (it goes through a 41,000-yearcycle ranging from 22.8 degrees to 24.4 degrees – today we are at around 23.5and declining - in other words it’s getting safer). This meant that the entireearth’s mass was tilted to a greater degree. This would add momentum to thecentrifugal thrust of the antipodal ice sheets.’AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL SOLUTIONDuring the rest of 1997, while I was busy trying to unravel the Atlantisblueprint, I had temporarily to leave the question of the causes of the mantledisplacement. Then in the spring of 1998 I received a letter from Donald TimSeitz Sr, who had written a scientific paper for the Royal Astronomical Societyof Canada entitled ‘A Probable Cause of Crustal Shifts of the Earth: A Cometapproaching the centre of mass of the Earth–Moon Gravitational System’. Thisappeared in Regulus, the journal of the society, in April 1998.Donald had put his finger on a solution and though I was now convinced that itwas a mantle rather than a crustal displacement, his theory worked perfectly.What he argued was that we tend to forget that our moon is quite large and hasits own gravitational pull. If a comet or asteroid or any other extraterrestrialobject is on a collision course with the earth then the force of the object isnot necessarily directed to the centre of the earth, as we would normally think.The position of the moon at the point of impact upon the earth is a veryimportant factor because its gravitational field will redirect the main thrustof the impact towards the mantle rather than the inner core of the planet.Let’s consider three cases.If the moon is directly behind the earth when the comet collides then the forceof the comet will be directed straight through the earth to the centre of theinner core. In effect, the moon doesn’t matter in this case.If the moon is between the earth and the comet then the moon will take theimpact, saving the earth.Let us imagine, however, that, as the comet is approaching, the moon is off toone side of the earth. Under these conditions the force of the comet is directedtowards the upper mantle, which is the centre of gravity of the earth–moongravitational system. This could very well dislodge the entire mantle. DonaldSeitz’s theory seems to be the missing piece in the puzzle of why thedisplacements occur.There are a multitude of forces at work to cause a mantle displacement. Theantipodal weight of the asymmetrical ice caps is one factor. The shape of theearth’s orbit is another, because it brings the planet closer to the biggestgravitational force in our area of space, namely the sun. The tilt of the earthis another factor, which like the ice sheets and the shape of the orbit is anentirely predictable phenomenon.These factors all appeared in When the Sky Fell but they really only set thestage for a potential displacement that must, after all, have been a mantledisplacement. These astronomical preconditions are insufficient on their own toaccount for all the facts. When we learn, however, that the inner core has itsown rotation and its own axis then the possibility for solving the hot spotproblem is at hand. The discontinuity between the inner core and the rest of themass of the planet allows us to postulate a mantle displacement, and DonaldSeitz’s breakthrough that the earth and the moon form a kind of ‘gravity well’seems to be the final piece in the puzzle. What remains a mystery is where thecomet or comets came from, where they hit the earth, how big they were, andwhether others will follow in the future.A TERRESTRIAL ALTERNATIVEAnother possibility for the cause of the mantle displacement could be thediscrepancy that grows between the axis of the inner core and the axis of therest of the planet. Today there is a 10-degree difference between the two and itis possible that at 9,600 BC, when the earth’s whole axis was angled at itsmaximum of 24.4 degrees, the difference between it and the inner core’s axis wasdangerously pronounced. The earth’s axis is governed by the pull of the sun,moon and other planets and follows a regular 41,000-year cycle. The peak of thatcycle was reached at 9,600 BC, at which time the planet’s whole axis began todecline after increasing for thousands of years.The classic work on this subject was published in Science in 1976: ‘Variationsin the Earth’s Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages’ by J. D. Hays, J. Imbrie and N.J. Schackleton.3 They showed that geological/climatic patterns coincide with theperiods when the earth’s tilt reaches its maximum of 24.4 degrees. The last timethis occurred was around 9,600 BC, exactly the time period when Plato’s ‘legend’of Atlantis places the flood. When we combine this theory with the recentrevelations about the inner core having its own axis, we have a much simpleridea than an extraterrestrial impact theory.After reaching its peak angle of tilt at 24.4 degrees, in a sense the axis headsback to where it had been. The inner core is very dense and thus has more massthan the rest of the planet. Perhaps when the rest of the planet’s mass startsmoving towards the axis of the inner core it creates an overwhelming attractionand the mantle displaces abruptly. The axis of the inner core and the axis ofthe rest of the mass of the earth are reunited abruptly and catastrophicallyThis, no doubt, would begin slowly, but would build momentum, resulting, in thefinal stages, in a rapid displacement. There would be plenty of warnings,observable by any scientifically advanced civilisation experiencing it.The arguments in favour of the ‘terrestrial’ force compared to‘extraterrestrial’ are considerable.The ‘extraterrestrial’ impact theory of a mantle displacement is unnecessarilycomplex. So many factors have to coincide that one can’t help doubt that thisidea is ad hoc and prone to constant revision and exceptions. How big must acomet or asteroid be to displace the mantle? Why would these extraterrestrialobjects collide with earth on a regular basis? Where is the moon relative to theincoming object? More importantly, an impact theory of displacement reallydoesn’t dovetail with the discoveries that the earth’s geological and climaticupheavals coincide with the earth’s axis tilt.I feel certain Charles Hapgood would agree that the terrestrial model is thebetter theory. It explains the placement of the ice sheets and coincides withthe timing developed by Hays, Imbrie and Schackleton. Hapgood seemed to beheading in this direction when he wrote to me: ‘I have recently concluded that a“drag effect” would operate whereby the movement of the rigid crust would set inmotion movements of the deeper layers, which would continue long after themovement of the crust stops, producing long-continued turbulence at thesurface.’ This indicates that Hapgood was constantly reappraising his theory andmaking modifications in light of new evidence. The fact that the inner core hasits own axis and rotates faster than the rest of the earth’s mass would surelyhave been factors that he would have wanted to incorporate into his theory.For these reasons I conclude that the force that caused the mantle displacementis tied to the dynamics of the inner core of the planet coupled with the gradualoscillations of the planet’s tilt cycle. Both factors can potentially reunitewhen the tilt of the outer earth reverses its gradual drift away from the innercore and results in a catastrophic reunion whereby both axes are broughttogether. The axis of the inner core and the rest of the planet are temporarilyreunited and may even contribute to a regeneration of the earth’s magneticfield. At this point, the pull of the sun, the moon and the rest of the planetsin our solar web once again begins to gradually separate the mantle’s axis fromthe inner core’s axis and the whole cycle begins again. If this theory iscorrect, we can be assured that we have thousands of years (about 29,400) beforeanother mantle displacement occurs."},{"pageContent":"NOTESPREFACE1.

Earth crust displacement accepts thatthese processes are gradual but posits a much more dramatic and abrupt movementof the crust that can explain different problems such as mass extinctions,glaciation patterns, and the sudden rise of agriculture. In stark contrast toplate tectonics’ slow motion of individual plates, an “earth crustdisplacement,” as postulated by Hapgood, abruptly shifts all the plates as asingle unit.

How the technology of coloring glass and goldsmithing – kept secretin certain families -became involved with esoteric philosophy is a long story’Maybury-Lewis, p. 183.14.

Flem-Ath, Rand, ‘A Global Model for the Origins of Agriculture’, TheAnthropological Journal of Canada, Vol. 19, No. 4, 1981, reprinted in 1995 as anappendix in When the Sky Fell.2. Rand noted (following the work of Vavilov) in the above paper that theearliest experiments with agriculture seem to correspond with land that is 1,500metres above ocean level.3. Charles knows from Rand and Rose’s first letter to him in April 1977 thatthey believe that Atlantis was Antarctica before the last displacement.4. Charles is referring to Rand’s article. Rand knows and believes thatagriculture began in Atlantis (Antarctica) many thousand of years earlier but hecannot say this in his article and expect to be published in a scientificjournal.5. The whereabouts of this manuscript is a mystery. Rand and Colin havecommunicated with Hapgood’s relatives and friends and have been unable to locatethis important unpublished manuscript.6. Rand and Colin both disagree with Hapgood on this point (see When the SkyFell and From Atlantis to the Sphinx).7. Rand had written about the correlation between altitude (1,500 metres aboveocean level) and agricultural origins: ‘This might be explained by crustaldisplacement, which would surely result in fantastic tidal waves. Any survivorswould have a strong motive for staying in high mountains.’ Charles took this tomean that Rand was advocating the notion of 1,500-metre-high tidal waves butwhat Rand meant was that any tidal waves would have the consequence of makingthe survivors afraid to live near the ocean.8. Rand and Rose developed this idea in When the Sky Fell (pp. 49–51), callingthis longitude (83 degrees west and 97 degrees east) the ‘line of greatestdisplacement’.9. Langway, C. C., Jr. and Lyle Hansen, ‘Drilling through the Ice Cap: ProbingClimate for a Thousand Centuries’, in Richard Lewis and P. M. Smith, The FrozenFuture: A Prophetic Report from Antarctica, Quadrangle Books, New York, 1973.Rand, who now has little faith in the ice core dating method, included this bookin his list of references because it contained the words ‘from Antarctica’. Itwas his own joke on the scientific journal that was publishing his article. Randwanted to include the idea of Atlantis but knew that any mention of the A’ wordwould doom any chances of getting published. The next best thing would be to getin the words ‘from Antarctica’. Charles’s remarks here are a sort of wink: ‘Iknow why you included that reference.’APPENDIX 6: SPENDING TIME AND WASTING SPACE: HOW ICE CORE DATING WENT WRONG1.
